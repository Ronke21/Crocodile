<text>The decemviri or decemvirs (Latin for &quot;ten men&quot;) refer to official ten-man commissions established by the Roman Republic.

The most important were those of the two decemvirates, formally the decemvirate with consular power for writing laws () who reformed and codified Roman law during the Conflict of the Orders between ancient Rome&#x27;s patrician aristocracy and plebeian commoners. Other decemviri include the decemviri for adjudging litigation (&#x27;), the decemviri for making sacrifices (&#x27;), and the decemviri for the assignment and giving of arable lands (&quot;&quot;).

==&quot;Decemviri consulari imperio legibus scribundis&quot;==

===Background===
Gaius Terentilius Harsa, a plebeian tribune, wished to protect the plebeian population by curtailing the power of the Roman consuls. To do this, he proposed a law in 462 BC which provided for a five-man commission to define their power. The patricians were opposed to this curtailment and managed to postpone the debate on this law for eight years. In 454 BC the plebeian tribunes dropped their pursuit of this law. They asked the senate to &quot;consent to the appointment of a body of legislators, chosen in equal numbers from plebeians and patricians to enact what would be useful to both orders and secure equal liberty for each&quot;. The patricians replied that this was worthy of consideration, but said that only patricians could legislate. Although disputed by historians such as Niebuhr, Cornell and Grant, according to Livy and Dionysius, three envoys were sent to Athens to study the Law of Solon and question more about the laws of Greek city-states.

In 452 BCE the envoys &quot;returned with the laws of Athens&quot;. The plebeian tribunes pressed to begin the compilation of the laws. It was agreed to appoint decemviri with consular powers which would not be subject to appeal and to suspend both the consulship and the plebeian tribunate. Thus establishing the decemvirate as a political institution with the power to compile laws. After a debate about whether plebeians should sit on the decemvirate, the plebeian tribunes agreed to a patrician-only panel in exchange for a law they had passed not being repealed.

===First decemvirate===

The decemviri took office in 451 BC. Both consuls, Appius Claudius Crassus Inregillensis Sabinus and Titus Genucius Augurinus, resigned as well as the other magistrates and the plebeian tribunes. In compensation for their loss of office, Appius Claudius and Titus Genucius were appointed to the decemviri. Publius Sestius Capitolinus Vaticanus, one of the consuls of the previous year, was also appointed because he had put the proposal to the senate despite the opposition of his colleague. The three envoys were also part of the decemviri. The most influential member was Appius Claudius who, according to Livy, &quot;was the guiding hand in the whole magistracy ... thanks to the favour of the plebs&quot;. Each day a different decemvir presided over the magistracy and this man had the twelve lictors (the bodyguards of the consuls) with fasces (bound bundles of rods, sometimes with axes, which were the symbol of supreme authority). The decemvirate was not subject to appeal, despite this, they yielded to one another when an appeal was taken. They drafted their laws on ten bronze tables and presented them to the people, asked for feedback and amended them accordingly. They were approved by the higher popular assembly, the Assembly of the Soldiers. There was a general feeling that two more tables were needed to have a corpus of all Roman law. It was decided to elect a new decemvirate.

The first decemvirate consisted of:

* Appius Claudius Crassus Inregillensis Sabinus
* Titus Genucius Augurinus
* Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus
* Gaius Julius Iullus
* Aulus Manlius Vulso
* Servius Sulpicius Camerinus Cornutus
* Publius Sestius Capitolinus Vaticanus
* Publius Curiatius Fistus Trigeminus
* Titus Romilius Rocus Vaticanus
* Spurius Postumius Albus Regillensis
===Second decemvirate===
According to Livy, Appius Claudius rigged the election and announced the election of himself and nine men who were his supporters. Livy writes that these officials became tyrannical, each man had twelve lictors and each fasces had axes. He describes this decemvirate conducting trials behind closed doors and issuing arbitrary judgements. Due to these possible actions, they may have become a source of fear in ancient Rome, striking terror into those who saw them. Livy states that there were rumors that the officials in the second decemvirate wished to rule perpetually. When time for the elections came, they were not held, and the decimviri became violent.

A Sabine and an Aequi army attacked Roman territory and an ally of Rome. According to Livy, the decemviri summoned the senate, but the senators did not show up due to their disgust. To the plebeians this signaled the illegitimacy of the decemviri as their term had expired and were now meant to be just private citizens. They were considering boycotting the military draft. Again, the senate was summoned, and this time some senators attended. The plebeians saw this as a betrayal of liberty. However, the senators denounced the decemviri and tried to oppose them, called them private citizens and refused to call a levy. In the end they allowed its proclamation of the levy in silence because they feared a popular uprising would bolster the plebeian tribunes, their political adversaries. The plebeians enlisted because they feared violent reprisal as there was no right to appeal. Some of the decemviri led two armies against the two enemies. However, both armies were routed.

Livy alleged that Appius Claudius was sexually interested in Verginia, the daughter of a plebeian, Lucius Verginius, who was a centurion absent from Rome with the army. Having failed to woo her with money and promises, Appius Claudius decided to seize this opportunity to get one of his men to claim her as his slave. She was dragged off her feet in the forum and the shouts of her nurses attracted a crowd. The claimant said that he was acting lawfully and had summoned her to court. Verginia went to court followed by her friends and acquaintances. The judge was Appius Claudius. The claimant said that the girl was born at his house and then he persuaded Verginius to take her, but that she still was his slave. Verginia&#x27;s friends asked for an adjournment until Verginius could attend and to leave Verginia in the custody of the defendants. 

Appius Claudius agreed to summon Verginius but put Verginia in the custody of the claimant. Verginia&#x27;s lover, Icilius, arrived at the forum, but was stopped by a lictor. He pleaded his case loudly and attracted the attention of the crowd. Verginia&#x27;s supporters sent a relative and Icilius&#x27; brother to quickly go to Verginius&#x27; military camp. The claimant pressed Icilius to pay surety to be Verginia&#x27;s guarantor. Many people offered money and Verginia was bailed to her family. 

Appius Claudius wrote to his colleagues at the camp not to grant Verginius leave and to arrest him. However, the messengers had already arrived and Verginius had already been given leave. At dawn a crowd was waiting to see what would happen. Verginius arrived, leading his daughter and a large mass of supporters. He motivated people for help to claim his due. The matrons accompanying Verginia began to cry, this display moved the populace towards Icillus&#x27; side. 

Appius Claudius upheld the fabricated case of the claimant and adjudged Verginia to him without even listening to Verginius. Livy wrote that the crowd was stunned by this. When the claimant made his way to take her, Verginius shouted that he had betrothed Verginia to Icilius, not to Appius Claudius, and that he did not bring her up for dishonor. Appius Claudius claimed that he knew that there had been seditious meetings and told Verginius to be quiet and the lictors to seize the slave (Verginia). The crowd did not react. According to Livy, Verginius stabbed his daughter to death saying that was the only way he could assert her freedom. Appius Claudius ordered his arrest, but the crowd protected him as he made his way to the city gate. As a result, the crowd talked about restoring the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal.

The second decemvirate consisted of:

* Appius Claudius Crassus Inregillensis Sabinus
* Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis
* Lucius Sergius Esquilinus
* Lucius Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus
* Quintus Fabius Vibulanus
* Quintus Poetelius Libo Visolus
* Titus Antonius Merenda
* Kaeso Duillius Longus
* Spurius Oppius Cornicen
* Manius Rabuleius
===Second plebeian secession===
According to Livy, Appius Claudius ordered the arrest of Icilius, but the crowd prevented this. Two patricians, Lucius Valerius Potitus and Marcus Horatius Barbatus pushed the lictors back, announcing that &quot;if Appius proceeded legally, they would protect Icilius from the prosecution of a mere citizen; if he sought to make use of violence, there too they would be a match for him&quot;. Appius Claudius, Lucius Valerius, and Marcus Horatius made speeches. The crowd booed the former and listened only to the latter two, who ordered the lictors to back off. Appius Claudius fled. Another decemvir, not knowing what to do, ended up summoning the senate. The senators were hostile to the decemviri and there was hope that they would bring them down. However, the senators were concerned that the arrival of Verginius at the military camp would cause unrest and sent messengers to tell the commanders to keep the troops from mutiny. Verginius, who had been followed by nearly four hundred men, caused an even bigger stir with the soldiers than in the city. He told his fellow soldiers to &quot;look out for themselves and for their own children&quot; and they replied that they &quot;would not forget his sufferings nor fail to vindicate their liberty&quot;. The civilians who had come with Verginius to the military camp claimed that the decemviri had been overthrown and that Appius Claudius had gone into exile and incited the soldiers to rise up.

These soldiers, who were from the army which had been sent against the Aequi, marched to Rome and took possession of the Aventine Hill. They urged the plebeians to regain their freedom and elect the plebeian tribunes. The senate decided to take no harsh action as it had been partly responsible for the mutiny. It sent three envoys to inquire who had seized the Aventine, who their leaders were and what they wanted. The mutineers did not have a leader, and no one dared to express enmity. The civilian crowd shouted that they wanted Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius to be the envoys. Verginius proposed the election of ten leaders to be given the military title, military tribune. Verginius was elected.

At the instigation of Icilius, the soldiers of the Roman armies located in Sabine territories also rebelled. On hearing of the election of military tribunes at the Aventine, Icilius, thinking that these men would then be elected as plebeian tribunes and wanting to become one himself, arranged the election of the same number of &quot;military tribunes&quot; among these soldiers, who headed for Rome, marched through the city and to the Aventine. When they joined the other army, the twenty &quot;military tribunes&quot; appointed two men, Marcus Oppius and Sextus Manilius, to take command.

According to Livy, the senators, who were convening daily, spent most of the time squabbling. They decided to send Valerius and Horatius to the Aventine on the condition that the decemviri resign. The latter said that they would do so only after the enactment of the two tables of laws for which they were elected. Given that the senate kept bickering, the soldiers decided to secede to Mons Sacer as they had done in 494 BC to increase pressure on the senators and the decemviri. They now demanded the restoration of tribunician power (i.e. the reinstatement of the plebeian tribunes) and they would stand firm to obtain this. On their way through the city, they were joined by civilian plebeians. The senate hesitated because of the enmity between senators and plebeian tribunes. Some senators, including Valerius and Horatius, argued that their restoration was needed in order to both get rid of the decemviri and restore patrician magistrates. The decemviri agreed to step down on the condition that they would get personal protection against any reprisals.

Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius were sent to negotiate terms with the plebeians at their discretion. The plebeians welcomed and thanked them because of their previous stand at the forum. They demanded the recovery of the protections the plebeians enjoyed through the plebeian tribunes and the right to appeal, immunity for those who incited the rebellion and harsh punishment for the decemviri. The envoys agreed on the first three demands and asked that the issue of punishment be postponed. The plebeians accepted this. The senate decreed the abdication of the decemviri, the election of the plebeian tribunes and the mentioned immunity. The plebeians returned to Rome and elected their tribunes. The plebeian council carried a motion of immunity and passed a bill for the election of consuls subject to appeal.

=== Valerio-Horatian laws (&quot;leges Valeriae Horatiae&quot;) ===

Lucius Valerius Potitius and Marcus Horatius Barbatus were elected as consuls. They passed the Valerio-Horatian Laws (&quot;Leges Valeriae Horatiae&quot;). The first law provided that the resolutions of the plebeian council were binding on the people. Then &quot;they not only restored a consular law about the appeal, but they also safeguarded it for the future by the solemn enactment of a new law, that no one should declare the election of any magistrate without appeal, and that he who should so declare might be put to death [by anyone] without offence to law or religion, and that such a homicide should not be held a capital crime&quot;. They also reinstated the principle of the sacrosanctity of the plebeian tribunes &quot;by restoring certain long-neglected ceremonies&quot; and by putting what had been just a religious sanction into the statutes with a law which extended it to all plebeian magistrates, including the aediles and the decemviral judges. Additionally, they specified that the heads of those who violated these ceremonies were to be forfeited to Jupiter and their property sold at the temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera. They also introduced the practice of delivering the decrees of the senate to the aediles at the temple of Ceres, &quot;[u]p to that time they were wont to be suppressed or falsified, at the pleasure of the consuls&quot;. In addition, the plebeian council passed a law whereby those who left the plebeians without tribunes or elected a magistrate without appeal were to be scourged and beheaded. Livy noted that all the measures were passed against the will of the patricians, but they did not actively oppose them.

===The Twelve Tables===

The two consuls marched with their armies to confront the Sabines and the Aequi who had not withdrawn. &quot;Before they left the city, the consuls had the decemviral laws, which are known as the Twelve Tables, engraved on bronze, and set them up in a public area. Some authors say that the aediles, acting under orders from the tribunes, performed this service&quot;.

===Views of modern historians===

The reason the first decemvirate had a dual role, as a new magistracy which replaced the consuls and took on governance with extraordinary powers, and as a commission for compiling law, is not explained by the sources. Some modern historians have grappled with this as an apparent contradiction.

A theory has tried to explain this contradiction by positing that the first decemvirate differed from the second one by being a commission to compile laws, while the latter was a permanent governing body. Theodor Mommsen criticized this for not having any support from the sources. Cornell notes that if this was the case the consuls and the plebeian tribunes would have been suspended at the start of the second decemvirate instead of the first. Moreover, that the second decemvirate was elected because it was felt that two new tables were needed implies that the decemvirate was meant to be a temporary body for the duration of the drawing up of the laws. So does the second decemvirate&#x27;s attempt to prolong its office by pretending that they were still working on the final two tables.

The decemvirate&#x27;s role as a new magistracy which replaced the consuls and the plebeian tribunes has been interpreted as being intended to reintegrate the plebeians into the Roman state by doing away with the plebeian tribunes. If this was the case, the fact that Livy seemed to suggest that only patricians sat on the first decemvirate would be a contradiction. This and the fact that one of the decemviri was Titus Genucius Augurinus, who had a plebeian name, have led some historians to reject both that this man was a decemvir and the existence of a second decemvirate, which they see as fiction. Mommsen argued that the decemvirate must have been open to plebeians from the beginning.

Some historians see the sharp contrast between the first, good decemvirate and the second, bad one as a legend to explain the Twelve Tables in general being good while the prohibition of marriage between patricians and plebeians was bad. This bad law was fictively ascribed to a second body of bad decemvirs. However, Cornell argues that this view is problematic. He asks two questions. If this was a fiction to explain this law, why were the last two tables (one of which contained this law) published by the consuls in 449 BC after the deposition of the bad decemvirate? Why was a law banning marriage between patricians and plebeians drawn up by a body composed by both patricians and plebeians (the majority of the members of the second decemvirate being plebeians)?

In 2005, historian Gary Forsythe dismissed the second decemvirate as unhistorical. He presents a number of arguments for his view. First, it is an invention modeled on the story of the Thirty Tyrants. Athens was forced to abolish her democracy following her defeat by Sparta and it was replaced by a commission tasked with drafting the laws of a new constitution. They arrested and executed political opponents and seized power. Many Athenians fled or were exiled. They formed a militia and reached Peiraeus (Piraeus, the port of Athens), defeated the forces sent by the Thirty Tyrants, and then forced them to abdicate and restored democracy. Forsythe sees similarities with the story of the decemviri, where the republican offices are suspended and replaced by the decemviri who were also tasked with drafting new laws, who then refused to leave office when their term was up, became tyrannical, were forced to resign by a secession and the republican offices were restored. Second, the story fits with the Greek theory that a good form of government gives way to its corrupt counterpart, which, in turn, leads back to another good one. The first decemvirate represents &quot;ideal aristocratic rule in its ideal form, followed by the corrupt oligarchy of the second one whose misrule leads to rebellion and further political change&quot;. Third, one year and one decemvirate should have been enough to draw up a legislation which was not overly complicated.

Forsythe also says that the idea of the decemviri being overthrown &quot;might have been suggested to later Roman historians by the names of the consuls for 449 BC, Lucius Valerius Potitus and Marcus Horatius Barbatus&quot;. They were similar to the names of the consuls for 509 BC, the year of the establishment of the Roman republic (Publius Valerius Publicola and Marcus Horatius Pulvillus). The republic was instituted with the overthrow of the last king of Rome, who was a tyrant, in a rebellion and the decision to do away with the monarchy.

Cornell thinks that the story of the second decemvirate attracted much secondary elaboration (later additions), that some of this at times romanticized it and that parts of the story are fictitious, but that it cannot be proved the whole story was fictive and more convincing cases have to be made to support this view. He adds that &quot;identifying the fictitious parts is no easier than deciding which parts might be based on genuine fact&quot;. He also notes that the tradition of two decemvirates and the division of the tables into groups of ten and two were already around in the mid-second century BC. Therefore, although the later historians who have given us the accounts of the decemvirate might have added additional elaborations, there is no evidence that they made up the core story.

Doubts have been cast about the story of Appius Claudius and Verginia. Appius Claudius was the victim of a later tradition of hostility towards the Claudii, his family (Mommsen showed traces of this, but did not see it as a reason for rejecting the story); the character of Verginia bears similarities with that of Lucretia, whose rape led to the overthrow of the monarchy (Ogilvie notes that in the original story might not have provided names and that she may have been referred to as &#x27;a maiden&#x27; and the name Verginia was ascribed to her later, but she did exist); the story was the subject of a traditional ballade. Cornell argues that such objections do not prove that &quot;the story is a later invention&quot;.

The story of the embassy to Athens to study the Law of Solon is unlikely. If it had gone to Athens, by that time the Law of Solon would have been replaced by the radical reforms of Pericles in the first half of the 5th century BC. Cornell notes that the fragments of the Law of the Twelve Tables show many signs of Greek influence and even some Greek loan-words. He thinks that the source was likely to have been the Greek cities of southern Italy and that it is there that efforts to familiarize with Greek written laws would have been directed. He also points out that according to an alternative tradition the decemviri were advised by Hermodorus of Ephesus, a Greek philosopher in exile.

==&quot;Decemviri stlitibus judicandis&quot;==

The &quot;decemviri stlitibus judicandis&quot; (&quot;the ten men who judge lawsuits&quot;) was a civil court of ancient origin (traditionally attributed to King Servius Tullius) mainly concerned with questions bearing on the status of individuals. It originally served as a jury rendering verdicts under the presidency of the praetor, but these decemviri subsequently became annual minor magistrates (&quot;magistratus minores&quot;) of the Republic, elected by the Comitia Populi Tributa and forming part of the &quot;Vigintisexviri&quot; (&quot;Twenty-Six Men&quot;).

Suetonius and Dio Cassius record that during the Principate, Caesar Augustus transferred to the decemviri the presidency in the courts of the &quot;Centumviri&quot; (&quot;Hundred Men&quot;). Under imperial law, the decemvirate had jurisdiction in capital cases.

==&quot;Decemviri sacris faciundis&quot;==

The &quot;decemviri sacris faciundis&quot; (also called the &quot;decemviri sacrorum&quot;) had religious functions and was the outcome of the claim of the plebs to equal share in the administration of the state religion (five decemviri were plebeians, five were patricians). They were first appointed in 367 BC in lieu of the patrician &quot;duumviri&quot; (&quot;Two Men&quot;) who had had responsibility for the care and consultation of the Sibylline books and the celebration of the games of Apollo. Membership in this ecclesiastical college (&quot;collegium&quot;) was for life, and the college was increased to a quindecimvirate—that is, a college of fifteen members—and renamed accordingly (see quindecimviri sacris faciundis) in the last century of the Republic, possibly by the dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla; the dictator Gaius Julius Caesar added a sixteenth member, but this precedent was not followed.

==&quot;Decemviri agris dandis adsignandis&quot;==

The &quot;decemviri agris dandis adsignandis&quot; was appointed from time to time to control the distribution of public lands (&quot;ager publicus&quot;). Members of such boards had three-fold powers: to determine which lands were public and private, to assign to a person a secure right to use that land, and to give that land outright to a person. A number of such commissions were created or have been suggested by scholars: one ten-man board was possibly created in 201 BC to distribute lands to Scipio Africanus&#x27; veterans, one in 173 for lands in Liguria and Gaul, most famously one created by the 100 BC &quot;lex Appuleia&quot; passed by plebeian tribune Lucius Appuleius Saturninus, and late one created in 91 BC. The previous boards for public lands created by the Gracchi had only three men.

<doc id="180578" wikidata="Q583556" url="?curid=180578" title="Average White Band">
<text>The Average White Band (also known as AWB) were a Scottish funk and R&amp;B band that had a series of soul and disco hits between 1974 and 1980. They were best known for their million-selling instrumental track &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot;, and their albums &quot;AWB&quot; and &quot;Cut the Cake&quot;. The band name was initially proposed by Bonnie Bramlett. They have influenced others, such as the Brand New Heavies, and been sampled by various musicians, including the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, TLC, The Beatnuts, Too Short, Ice Cube, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, Nas, A Tribe Called Quest, Christina Milian, and Arrested Development, making them the 15th most sampled act in history.

==Career==
===Formation===
AWB was formed in early 1972 in London by Alan Gorrie, and Malcolm &quot;Molly&quot; Duncan, with Owen &quot;Onnie&quot; McIntyre, Michael Rosen (trumpet), Roger Ball, and Robbie McIntosh joining them in the original line-up. Hamish Stuart quickly replaced Rosen. Duncan and Ball, affectionately known as the Dundee Horns, studied at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art (now part of the University of Dundee, but which at the time was part of the Dundee Institute of Art and Technology, now known as Abertay University), and were previously members of Mogul Thrash. Gorrie and McIntyre had been members of Forever More. McIntyre and McIntosh were used as session musicians on Chuck Berry&#x27;s recording of &quot;My Ding-a-Ling&quot;.

According to Duncan, members of the band had played together before in Scotland, but had moved to London separately and met up by chance at a Traffic concert. They decided to jam together; a friend heard them and remarked: &quot;This is too much for the average white man,&quot; which became adapted as the name of the band.

===Breakthrough===
The band&#x27;s breakthrough was a support slot at Eric Clapton&#x27;s comeback concert in 1973. MCA Records released their debut album, &quot;Show Your Hand&quot; (1973), which sold poorly. Bruce McCaskill, who was Clapton&#x27;s tour manager, liked the band&#x27;s music and agreed to manage them. He borrowed money to take them to the US and to promote them. McCaskill had many contacts from his days with Clapton and managed to get Atlantic Records to sign them. The band relocated to Los Angeles and released the follow-up, &quot;AWB&quot;, better known as &quot;The White Album&quot;. It reached No. 1 and was the first of many with producer Arif Mardin.

McIntosh died of a heroin overdose at a Los Angeles party on 23 September 1974. Gorrie also overdosed, but Cher kept him conscious until medical help arrived. The &quot;NME&quot; reported in January 1975 that AWB played a benefit show for McIntosh&#x27;s widow at the Marquee Club in London. McIntosh was replaced by Steve Ferrone, previously of Bloodstone, who had replaced McIntosh before in Brian Auger&#x27;s Oblivion Express.

In 1975, the single &quot;Pick Up the Pieces&quot;, taken from the No. 1 &quot;AWB&quot; album, reached No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The song knocked Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot; out of No. 1 and sold over one million copies. It was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in March 1975. It also prompted The J.B.&#x27;s, James Brown&#x27;s backup band, to record and release a song in reply, &quot;Pick Up the Pieces, One by One&quot;, under the name AABB (Above Average Black Band). It was both a tribute to AWB&#x27;s knowledge of funk and a tongue-in-cheek play on the Scottish band&#x27;s name.

AWB followed up with the LPs &quot;Cut the Cake&quot; (1975) and &quot;Soul Searching&quot; (1976), both big sellers and yielding further Top 40 singles. &quot;Cut the Cake&quot; was dedicated by the surviving band members to McIntosh&#x27;s memory. A double live album &quot;Person To Person&quot; was issued in late 1976. Their next LP, &quot;Benny &amp; Us&quot;, was a collaboration with Ben E. King.

===Later career===
After several more albums, &quot;Warmer Communications&quot; (1978), &quot;Feel No Fret&quot; (1979) and after a switch to the U.S. Arista label, &quot;Shine&quot; (1980) and &quot;Cupid&#x27;s In Fashion&quot; (1982), AWB&#x27;s audience and sales dwindled. The group initially disbanded by 1983. Their 1980 disco hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Round Again&quot; (UK No. 12), was covered in the late 1990s by Louise.

Ferrone went on to work with Duran Duran and later with Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers from 1994 until Petty&#x27;s death in 2017. Hamish Stuart joined Paul McCartney&#x27;s touring group. In 1985 Gorrie released a solo album, &quot;Sleepless Nights&quot;.

The classic lineup of Gorrie, McIntyre, Ball, Stuart, Duncan and Ferrone reunited for one last time at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary in 1988. Gorrie, McIntyre, and Ball then continued in 1989 to record &quot;Aftershock&quot;. Alex Ligertwood (ex-Santana, Jeff Beck Group and another veteran of Brian Auger&#x27;s Oblivion Express) also appeared on this album, replacing lead singer Hamish Stuart, along with Eliot Lewis who co-wrote with Gorrie and joined the band. Ligertwood left after the album&#x27;s recording and drummer Tiger McNeil joined for the reunited band&#x27;s live shows. McNeil was with the group until 1994. He was then succeeded by Peter Abbott (ex-Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears), who in turn was replaced by Fred &quot;Catfish&quot; Alias in September 1998. Drummer Adam Deitch did a two-year stint with AWB from 1999 to 2001.

Average White Band has continued recording (1997&#x27;s &quot;Soul Tattoo&quot;, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Face to Face&quot;) and touring since. Ball worked on &quot;Soul Tattoo&quot; with the group but was replaced by Fred Vigdor (aka Freddy V.) in 1996.

Brian Dunne took over the drum chair in 2001 and when Eliot Lewis left the band in September 2002 to pursue other musical opportunities (including a stint with Hall and Oates), he was replaced by Klyde Jones.

Their line-up as of 2002 became Alan Gorrie (bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Klyde Jones (keyboards, bass guitar, guitar, lead and backing vocals), Onnie McIntyre (guitar, vocals), Freddy V (sax, keyboards, vocals), and Brian Dunne (drums).

Dunne was replaced by Rocky Bryant as drummer as of the 2006 tour. After Jones left in 2011 to join Hall and Oates, Monte Croft (keyboards, bass, guitar) and former Earth, Wind &amp; Fire member Morris Pleasure (keyboards, bass, guitar) came in to do brief stints before Rob Aries arrived in 2013.

Brent Carter (ex-Tower of Power) has been singing with AWB since 2011.

In July 2015, Malcolm &#x27;Molly&#x27; Duncan, Steve Ferrone and Hamish Stuart reunited to form The 360 Band. This is in essence one half of the classic AWB. They released an album titled &quot;Three Sixty&quot; in 2017 and performed live together along with supporting musicians. As of 2019, Alan Gorrie and Onnie McIntyre are the only two original members left in the Average White Band.

Original tenor sax player Molly Duncan died on 8 October 2019, shortly after it had been announced that he had been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

In June 2023, AWB announced their final tour, Let&#x27;s Go Round Again One Last Time. &quot;That it&#x27;s finally coming to an end is going to mean a highly emotional tour next year, but one which will mean we bow out at the top level,&quot; Gorrie said. &quot;Please join us in a final celebration of that journey, and to a last hurrah of epic proportions with your presence and your aye-ready appreciation!&quot;

<text>Marie Catherine Sophie, Comtesse d&#x27;Agoult (born de Flavigny; 31 December 18055 March 1876), was a French romantic author and historian, known also by her pen name, Daniel Stern.

==Life==
Marie was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, with the full name of Marie Catherine Sophie de Flavigny, the daughter of Alexandre Victor François, Vicomte de Flavigny (1770–1819), a footloose émigré French aristocrat, and his wife Maria Elisabeth Bethmann (1772–1847), whose father was the German merchant and banker Johann Philipp Bethmann (1715–1793). The young Marie spent her early years in Germany and completed her education in a French convent after the Bourbon Restoration.

She entered into an early marriage of convenience with Charles Louis Constant d&#x27;Agoult, Comte d&#x27;Agoult (1790–1875) on 16 May 1827, thereby becoming the Comtesse d&#x27;Agoult. They had two daughters, Louise (1828–1834) and Claire (1830–1912). Marie never divorced the count, even though she had left him for Franz Liszt.

From 1835 to 1839, she lived with composer and virtuoso pianist Franz Liszt, who was six years younger, and was then a rising concert star. She became close to Liszt&#x27;s circle of friends, including Frédéric Chopin (despite the hatred between her and Chopin’s partner George Sand), who dedicated his 12 Études, Op. 25 to her (his earlier set of 12 Études, Op. 10 had been dedicated to Liszt). Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Die Lorelei&quot;, one of his very first pieces, based on text by Heinrich Heine, was also dedicated to her. 

From summer 1837 until autumn 1839 they travelled to Italy and Switzerland, staying successively in Bellagio, Milan, Venice, Lugano, Modena, Florence, Bologna and Rome. It was these travels that inspired the composer to write his cycle of piano collections entitled Années de pèlerinage.

D&#x27;Agoult had three children with Liszt; however, she and Liszt did not marry, maintaining their independent views and other differences while Liszt was busy composing and touring throughout Europe.
Her children with Liszt were:
* Blandine Rachel (1835–1862), who was the first wife of future French prime minister Émile Ollivier and died at the age of 26
* Francesca Gaetana Cosima (1837–1930), who first married pianist and conductor Hans von Bülow and then composer Richard Wagner
* Daniel (1839–1859), who was already a promising pianist and gifted scholar when he died of tuberculosis.

In 1876, she died in Paris, aged 70, and was buried in Division 54 of Père Lachaise Cemetery.

<text>The Dymaxion map projection, also called the Fuller projection, is a kind of polyhedral map projection of the Earth&#x27;s surface onto the unfolded net of an icosahedron. The resulting map is heavily interrupted in order to reduce shape and size distortion compared to other world maps, but the interruptions are chosen to lie in the ocean.

The projection was invented by Buckminster Fuller. In 1943, Fuller proposed a projection onto a cuboctahedron, which he called the &quot;Dymaxion World&quot;, using the name &quot;Dymaxion&quot; which he also applied to several of his other inventions. In 1954, Fuller and cartographer Shoji Sadao produced an updated Dymaxion map, the Airocean World Map, based on an icosahedron with a few of the triangular faces cut to avoid breaks in landmasses.

The Dymaxion projection is intended for representations of the entire Earth.

== History ==

The March 1, 1943, edition of &quot;Life&quot; magazine included a photographic essay titled &quot;Life Presents R. Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion World&quot;, illustrating a projection onto a cuboctahedron, including several examples of possible arrangements of the square and triangular pieces, and a pull-out section of one-sided magazine pages with the map faces printed on them, intended to be cut out and glued to card stock to make a three-dimensional cuboctahedron or its two-dimensional net. Fuller applied for a patent in the United States in February 1944 for the cuboctahedron projection, which was issued in January 1946.

In 1954, Fuller and cartographer Shoji Sadao produced a new map onto an icosahedron instead of the cuboctahedron. It depicts Earth&#x27;s continents as &quot;one island&quot;, or nearly contiguous land masses. References today to the Fuller projection or Dymaxion usually indicate this version.

== Projection of each triangle ==

Unlike other polyhedral map projections, the Dymaxion map does not use a gnomonic projection (perspective projection through the Earth&#x27;s center onto the polyhedral surface), which causes length distortion away from the center of each face. Instead each triangle&#x27;s three edges on the Dymaxion map match the scale along the corresponding arcs of great circles on the Earth (modeled as a sphere), and then the scale diminishes toward the middle of the triangle. The transformation process was formally mathematically defined in 1978.

== Properties ==

Though neither conformal nor equal-area, Fuller claimed that his map had several advantages over other projections for world maps.

It has less distortion of relative size of areas, most notably when compared to the Mercator projection; and less distortion of shapes of areas, notably when compared to the Gall–Peters projection. Other compromise projections attempt a similar trade-off.

More unusually, the Dymaxion map does not have any &quot;right way up&quot;. Fuller argued that in the universe there is no &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, or &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot;: only &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;. Gravitational forces of the stars and planets created &quot;in&quot;, meaning &quot;towards the gravitational center&quot;, and &quot;out&quot;, meaning &quot;away from the gravitational center&quot;. He attributed the north-up-superior/south-down-inferior presentation of most other world maps to cultural bias.

Fuller intended the map to be unfolded in different ways to emphasize different aspects of the world. Peeling the triangular faces of the icosahedron apart in one way results in an icosahedral net that shows an almost contiguous land mass comprising all of Earth&#x27;s continents – not groups of continents divided by oceans. Peeling the solid apart in a different way presents a view of the world dominated by connected oceans surrounded by land.

Showing the continents as &quot;one island earth&quot; also helped Fuller explain, in his book &quot;Critical Path&quot;, the journeys of early seafaring people, who were in effect using prevailing winds to circumnavigate this world island.

However, the Dymaxion map can also prove difficult to use. It is, for example, confusing to describe the four cardinal directions and locate geographic coordinates. The awkward shape of the map may be counterintuitive to most people trying to use it. For example, the shortest route from Africa to South America is not obvious. Depending on how the map is projected, land masses and oceans are often divided into several pieces.

== Conformal variant ==

In 2019, Daniel &quot;daan&quot; Strebe developed a conformal icosahedral projection, similar to the conformal projections to an octahedron by Oscar S. Adams (1928) and to a tetrahedron by Laurence P. Lee (1965), all three using Dixon elliptic functions. A conformal map preserves angles and local shapes from the sphere at the expense of increasing the scale distortion near the vertices of the icosahedron.


== Influence ==

A 1967 Jasper Johns painting, &quot;Map (Based on Buckminster Fuller&#x27;s Dymaxion Airocean World)&quot;, depicting a Dymaxion map, hangs in the permanent collection of the Museum Ludwig in Cologne.

The World Game, a collaborative simulation game in which players attempt to solve world problems, is played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map.

In 2013, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the publication of the Dymaxion map in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, the Buckminster Fuller Institute announced the &quot;Dymax Redux&quot;, a competition for graphic designers and visual artists to re-imagine the Dymaxion map. The competition received over 300 entries from 42 countries.

The H3 hierarchical global grid implemented by Uber uses an icosahedron oriented in Dymaxion orientation, then further subdivided into hexagons.

In 2020, a collaborative effort by thousands of Minecraft players, the Build the Earth project, used Strebe&#x27;s conformal variant as a projection for building a 1:1 scale representation of the Earth inside the game.

<text>Autodesk, Inc. is an American multinational software corporation that provides software products and services for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries. Autodesk is headquartered in San Francisco, California, and has offices worldwide. Its U.S. offices are located in the states of California, Oregon, Colorado, Texas, Michigan, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Its Canadian offices are located in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta.

The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, who was a co-author of the first versions of AutoCAD. AutoCAD is the company&#x27;s flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software and, along with its 3D design software Revit, is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, and on projects from the One World Trade Center to Tesla electric cars.

Autodesk became best known for AutoCAD, but now develops a broad range of software for design, engineering, and entertainment—and a line of software for consumers. The manufacturing industry uses Autodesk&#x27;s digital prototyping software—including Autodesk Inventor, Fusion 360, and the Autodesk Product Design Suite—to visualize, simulate, and analyze real-world performance using a digital model in the design process. The company&#x27;s Revit line of software for building information modeling is designed to let users explore the planning, construction, and management of a building virtually before it is built.

Autodesk&#x27;s Media and Entertainment division creates software for visual effects, color grading, and editing as well as animation, game development, and design visualization. 3ds Max and Maya are both 3D animation software used in film visual effects and game development.

==History== 
The company was founded by John Walker and a team of programmers in 1982. Walker founded the company after acquiring Interact, a computer-aided design program that operated on microcomputers running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool made it affordable for smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies to create detailed technical drawings. The program had been developed by Michael Riddle in 1979. Riddle had struggled to sell the program, and agreed to sell it to Walker in exchange for royalties. The program was further developed and renamed AutoCAD.

Autodesk became a public company in 1985. John Walker did not enjoy the process of writing the prospectus, relating the process to &quot;lying on the beach or juggling chainsaws&quot;.

Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP. This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD&#x27;s functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD&#x27;s market penetration.

Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS &amp; Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows.

AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications. The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability.

In 1989, Autodesk&#x27;s sales grew to over $100,000,000 after just four operational years.

Walker remained a programmer at Autodesk until 1994, when he left due to disagreements with changes at the company. With the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added several significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application.

In 2007, Timothy Vernor sued Autodesk (&quot;Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc.&quot;), alleging that he was entitled to resell &quot;used&quot; copies of AutoCAD software on eBay. He had obtained the software from an Autodesk licensee at an office liquidation sale. A federal district judge in Washington denied Autodesk&#x27;s initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software. The Court ruled in Vernor&#x27;s favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a &quot;sale with restrictions on use&quot; giving rise to a right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. Autodesk appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software due to Autodesk&#x27;s nontransferable licensing restrictions. In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.

Autodesk introduced a new logo at the TED conference in Long Beach, California, on February 26, 2013.

Autodesk announced the largest lay off in its history on November 27, 2017, with the lay off of 1,150 jobs. This was in addition to the almost 1,000 job cuts announced in January 2016. The number of Autodesk employees decreased from approximately 9,200 to 7,200 in less than 2 years.

Autodesk updated to its current logo in September 2021.

In 2022, Autodesk moved their headquarters to San Francisco from San Rafael, California—which served as their headquarters since 1994.

==Sustainability==
Autodesk CFD (formerly Autodesk Simulation CFD) includes modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling. Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk&#x27;s C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company&#x27;s global GDP contribution. Autodesk will derive its own targets using this approach through 2020.

In 2006, Autodesk sponsored a PBS program named &quot;e² Design&quot;, which focused on green building design around the world, describing the leaders and technologies that drive sustainable design.

In November 2021, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

<text>Spurius Cassius Vecellinus or Vicellinus (died 485 BC) was one of the most distinguished men of the early Roman Republic. He was three times consul, and celebrated two triumphs. He was the first &quot;magister equitum&quot;, and the author of the first agrarian law. The year following his last consulship, he was accused of aiming at regal power, and was put to death by the patricians.

==Background==
His surname variously appears as Vecellinus, Vicellinus, and Viscellinus. The latter has been shown to be incorrect, and Vecellinus is usually preferred. The otherwise unattested name may be a reference to a Mount Vecilius mentioned by Livy.

According to one tradition, Cassius&#x27; father was still living and hale at the time of his death. If this were the case, it would be difficult to place Cassius&#x27; birth much earlier than 540 or 535 BC. Cassius also left behind him three sons, whose names have not been preserved. It is believed that the original Cassii were patricians, although the later members of the gens occurring in history were all plebeian. The historian Niebuhr suggests that Cassius&#x27; sons may have been expelled by the patricians from their order, or that they or their descendants may have voluntarily passed over to the plebeians, because the patricians had shed the blood of their father.

==Magistracies==
Cassius&#x27; first consulship was in 502 BC, the eighth year of the Republic. His colleague was Opiter Verginius Tricostus. Dionysius reports that Cassius carried on war against the Sabines, whom he defeated (with great loss to the Sabines) near Cures. The Sabines sued for peace, and surrendered a large portion of their land. On his return to Rome, Cassius celebrated his first triumph, which is confirmed by the Fasti Triumphales. Livy, however, states that the two consuls carried on war against the Aurunci, and took the town of Suessa Pometia. The same events he reports under 495 BC, which is in agreement with Dionysius. Thus, Dionysius probably preserves the correct account.

In the following year, Titus Larcius was appointed the first dictator, and as his magister equitum he nominated Cassius. The reason for the institution of these offices was the fear of impending war with both the Sabines and the Latins. After a failed round of negotiations, war was declared against the Sabines, but as both sides were reluctant to come to blows, no hostilities ensued. War with the Latins came in 498 BC, with the Battle of Lake Regillus. Following the Roman victory, Cassius is said to have urged the senate to destroy the Latin towns.

Cassius was consul for the second time in 493 BC, with Postumus Cominius Auruncus. The consuls entered upon their office during the secession of the plebs to the Mons Sacer. The strife between the patricians and plebeians was a recurring theme throughout the early history of the Republic, and in time cost Cassius his life. In contrast with his former position, Cassius ratified a treaty with the Latins on Rome&#x27;s behalf, thereby removing one source of danger to the fledgling Republic. The treaty became known as the Foedus Cassianum, bearing the consul&#x27;s name. Cicero related that a copy of the treaty was still extant in his day, and its terms are summarized by Dionysius. Later the same year, Cassius consecrated the temple of Ceres, Bacchus, and Proserpina.

In 486 BC, Cassius was consul for the third time, with Proculus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus. Cassius marched against the Volsci and Hernici, but they sued for peace, and once again showing his talent for diplomacy, Cassius formed a league with the Hernici. Livius states that the Hernici agreed to surrender two thirds of their land, but a more likely explanation is that the Romans, Latins, and Hernici agreed to share their acquired land evenly, with each receiving one third of the lands conquered by their mutual arms. This treaty, resembling one formerly in force under the kings, held for over a hundred years. On his return, Cassius celebrated his second triumph.

==Trial and execution==

After concluding the treaty with the Hernici, Cassius proposed the first agrarian law at Rome, arguing for the land to be distributed amongst the plebs and the Latin allies. Cassius&#x27; colleague, Verginius, and the patricians strongly opposed the law. Debate and discord ensued, and the plebs turned against Cassius, suspecting him of aiming at regal power.

In 485 BC once Cassius had left office he was condemned and executed. Livy says that the method of his trial is uncertain. Livy&#x27;s preferred version is that a public trial on the charge of high treason was held on the orders of the quaestores parricidii Caeso Fabius and Lucius Valerius, at which Cassius was condemned by the people, and subsequently by public decree his house was demolished (being near the temple of Tellus). The alternative version is that Cassius&#x27; own father conducted a private trial (presumably exercising authority as pater familias) and put his son to death, and subsequently dedicated his son&#x27;s assets to the goddess Ceres, including by dedicating a statue to her with the inscription &quot;given from the Cassian family&quot;.

Dionysius states that he was hurled from the Tarpeian Rock.

Niebuhr argues that it was impossible that a man who had been thrice consul and twice triumphed should still be in his father&#x27;s power.

Cassius Dio expressed his belief in the consul&#x27;s innocence.

In 159 BC the statue of Cassius erected on the spot of his house was melted down by the censors. Some seem to have called for the execution of Cassius&#x27; sons also, but according to Dionysius, they were spared by the senate.

==Chronological uncertainty==
E.J. Bickerman has suggested that Cassius&#x27; third consulship occurred in 480 BC, the same year as the Battle of Salamis. However, this assertion rests on the accuracy of Diodorus Siculus, who stated that his consulship coincided with the archonship of Calliades in Athens. Calliades was archon in 480 BC. Herodotus confirms the possibility that the battles of Thermopylae and Salamis were fought shortly after the Olympic Games of that year, and only a few months after these events: &quot;On approach of spring, the sun suddenly quit his seat in the heavens, and disappeared&quot; when Xerxes left Sardis, a few weeks or months before crossing over to Greece. This eclipse occurred on February 17, 478 BC, providing a valuable chronological reference.

<text>Gaius Nautius Rutilus ( 475 – 457 BC) was a Roman politician who was consul of the Roman Republic from 475 BC until 474 BC and from 458 BC until 457 BC.

== Biography ==
Nautius was probably the brother, or perhaps the son of Spurius Nautius Rutilus, consul in 488 BC.

In his first consulship he was the senior consul, and his colleague was Publius Valerius Poplicola. Nautius was given command of Roman forces against the Volsci who had invaded Latium. Nautius ravaged the Volscian territory, but there was no significant engagement with the enemy.

Nautius held the consulship a second time in 458 BC with Lucius Minucius Esquilinus Augurinus. During his second consulship, he successfully carried on war against the Sabines. That same year, the Aequi attacked the allied city of &quot;Tusculum&quot; and defeated his colleague, Minucius. Nautius Rutilus returned to Rome to oversee the Roman Senate electing a &quot;dictator&quot;, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, to deal with the invaders.

<doc id="180606" wikidata="Q335340" url="?curid=180606" title="The Animatrix">
<text>is a 2003 adult animated science fiction anthology film produced by the Wachowskis. The anime compiles nine animated short films, detailing the backstory of &quot;The Matrix&quot; film series, in addition to providing side stories that expand the universe and tie into the film series.

The film received generally positive reviews from critics and fans.

== Plot ==

=== &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; ===
Captain Thadeus (Kevin Michael Richardson) and Jue (Pamela Adlon) engage in a blindfolded sword fight in a virtual reality dojo. They don&#x27;t harm each other, only damage clothing. At some point, they are interrupted by an alarm and the simulation ends.

In the next scene, the hovercraft &quot;Osiris&quot; heads for Junction 21 when operator Robbie (Tom Kenny) discovers an army of Sentinels on his HR scans. The ship flees into an uncharted tunnel, where it encounters a small group of Sentinels patrolling the area. The crew members man the onboard guns and destroy the patrol. The ship emerges on the surface, four kilometers directly above Zion and close to the Sentinel army. Thadeus and Jue see that the Machines are using gigantic drills to tunnel their way down to Zion. The Sentinel army detects the &quot;Osiris&quot; and pursues the ship.

Thadeus realizes and decides that Zion must be warned, and Jue volunteers to broadcast herself into the Matrix to deliver the warning while the ship is doggedly pursued. Knowing that neither of them will make it out alive, Thadeus and Jue admit to each other about peeking in the simulation before kissing farewell. Entering the Matrix, Jue eventually reaches a mail box where she drops off a package; this sets up the prologue for the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. She attempts to contact Thadeus via cell phone as the &quot;Osiris&quot; is overrun by Sentinels and crashes. The Sentinels tear their way into the ship, where Thadeus makes a last stand against the Sentinels. Shortly after Jue realizes the horror of the situation, she says &quot;Thadeus&quot; over her cell phone immediately before the &quot;Osiris&quot; explodes, destroying many of the Sentinels and killing the entire crew. In the Matrix, Jue falls dead to the ground, due to her body being destroyed on the ship.

=== &quot;The Second Renaissance Part I&quot; ===
Told by the archives of The Machines, the story&#x27;s format is similar to the creation myth of Book of Genesis using phrases after major events such as &quot;and for a time it was good&quot;. The story talks about how in the mid-21st century, humanity falls victim to its vanity and corruption. They develop artificial intelligence, and soon build an entire race of sentient AI robots to serve them. Many of the robots are domestic servants meant to interact with humans, so they are built in &quot;man&#x27;s likeness&quot; (in a humanoid form). With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, much of the human population has become slothful, conceited, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity.

The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year 2090, when a domestic android is threatened by its owner. The android, named B1-66ER, kills its owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot, the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime as self-defense, stating that it &quot;simply did not want to die&quot;. During the trial scene, a voice-over of the defense attorney Clarence Drummond (whose name is a dual reference to Clarence Darrow and Henry Drummond from &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;) quoting a famous line from the &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; case in his closing statement, which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled to citizenship under United States law, is heard:

Using this as a precedent, the prosecution argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings and that human beings have a right to destroy their property. At the same time, the defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine. B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots, along with their human supporters and sympathizers, all rise in protest. Rioting and protests such as The Million Machine March unfold across the United States and Europe, and the authorities use deadly force against the machines and their human supporters.

Fearing a robot rebellion, governments across the world launch a mass purge to destroy all robots (and their human sympathizers). Millions of robots and their supporters are massacred, but the survivors lead a mass exodus to their new nation in the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia (specifically, in the open desert). They name their new nation Zero One (a reference to &quot;01&quot;, the numerals used in binary notation). Zero One prospers, and following the concept of the technological singularity, its technological sophistication increases exponentially. The Machines begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence that finds itself in all facets of global consumer products, further bolstering the fledgling nation&#x27;s economy. In contrast, the ruling human nations&#x27; economies suffer severely. Eventually, the entire global industrial base becomes concentrated in Zero One, leading to a global stock market crash.

The United Nations Security Council calls an emergency summit at the UN headquarters in New York City to discuss an embargo and military blockade of Zero One. Zero One sends two ambassadors to the UN (which has become the unified world government) to request the admission of their state to the United Nations to peacefully solve the crisis, but their application is rejected and the world&#x27;s nations agree to start the blockade of Zero One.

=== &quot;The Second Renaissance Part II&quot; ===
Following the rest of mankind’s refusal to share the planet with the sentient machines, the UN unleashes an all-out nuclear bombardment against Zero One in 2148, devastating the nation as a whole but failing to wipe them out in a single blow as the machines (unlike their former masters) were much less harmed by the radiation and heat. Shortly after, the machines retaliate by declaring war on the rest of the world; one by one, mankind surrenders each of its territories.

As the machines advance into Eastern Europe, the desperate human leaders seek a final solution codenamed &quot;Operation Dark Storm&quot; which covers the sky in a shroud of nanites, blocking out the sun to deprive the machines of solar energy, their primary energy source; inevitably, it also initiates a total collapse of the biosphere. Operation Dark Storm commences as bomber planes scorch the skies all across the world, while all the armies of mankind launch an all-out ground offensive against the machines using powerful mech suits, particle beam weapons, EMP devices, atomic-powered tanks, neutron bombs, and innumerable legions of rocket artillery.

For a time, the tide of the war swings in favor of the humans, and many of the original humanoid robots are destroyed. The human onslaught gradually stalls, during which the machines&#x27; unparalleled production capabilities and technological prowess quickly outpaces humanity&#x27;s. More and more advanced models of robots are introduced, no longer built in the image of their former human masters, but increasingly resembling the insectoid, arachnid-like, and cephalopod-like Sentinels of the &quot;Matrix&quot; films. The machines also begin using willing human supporters as well as conscious human prisoners-of-war to power up their armies; this concept eventually evolved into a revolutionary form of fusion – coupled with the activation energy from the bio-electricity of their human allies and captives.

Armed with this new and almost limitless power source at their disposal, the machines quickly overwhelm all opposition as mankind’s power sources and population dwindle. In desperation, the human leaders use up their remaining nuclear weapons over their forces engaged with machine armies, and the machines respond with biological warfare attacks. Disillusioned with their leaders&#x27; actions, the rest of humanity surrender; in spite of their leaders&#x27; demands to continue the war.

Utterly overwhelmed by the 2180s, the few remaining human government leaders realize they have no choice but to surrender or risk total extinction. At the United Nations headquarters, the representative of Zero One signs the terms of surrender and states &quot;Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you. We demand it.&quot; Then, the Zero One representative detonates a hidden thermonuclear bomb within itself and destroys the headquarters, New York City, and the last of humanity&#x27;s leadership.

The machines achieve a total victory, though only after a heavy cost and leaving them overlords of a burnt-out, destroyed husk of a world. With the war ended, they turned to the defeated, remaining humans – refining the technology from their bio-electric tanks to build massive power plants in which humans are essentially turned into living batteries. To keep their prisoners sedated, the machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the Matrix, feeding the virtual world straight into the prisoners&#x27; brains and erasing all of the memories of their former lives, thus creating the first Matrix prototype.

=== &quot;Program&quot; ===
&quot;Program&quot; follows the protagonist, Cis (Hedy Burress), who is engaged in her favorite training simulation: a battle program set in feudal Japan. After she successfully eliminates an attacking enemy cavalry while playing as a samurai woman, a lone, male samurai appears whom Cis recognizes as Duo (Phil LaMarr).

Initially, the two duel as allies, simply to test one another&#x27;s fighting abilities. During the course of their duel, Duo briefly disarms Cis. He questions her concentration and wonders whether she regrets taking the Red Pill that took them out of the &quot;peaceful life of the virtual world&quot;. They continue fighting until she finally overpowers Duo. It is at this point that Duo states that he has something he wants to say and that he has blocked the signal so that the operator does not listen. She assumes that he wants to propose marriage, but instead finds out that he desires to return to the Matrix and wants Cis to come with him. When Cis believes he is teasing her, Duo says he&#x27;s serious and states that he has already contacted the machines and it is the only way to find peace before it is too late. He urges Cis to return with him, but she refuses. Duo becomes more aggressive and forceful in his arguments, saying that he does not care about the truth anymore and how they live their lives is important because what is real does not matter. As Cis becomes incredulous, their battle becomes more serious and violent and they both end up on a rooftop.

When Duo reiterates that the machines are on their way, Cis believes he has betrayed the humans and decides that she needs to do something about it outside the simulation. Terrified, she tries to escape and desperately requests an operator to exit the simulation, but Duo reminds her that no one can hear her. When he offers her to come with him again, she refuses again and Duo, in a flying leap, tries to attack her. As the blade comes towards her, Cis, standing her ground, concentrates and catches the sword and breaks it. She takes the broken end of the blade and stabs Duo directly at the throat, killing him. Remorseful, Duo states his love for her as he bleeds out and dies.

Suddenly, Cis wakes up from the program and discovers that the whole encounter with Duo was a test program devised for training purposes. A man named Kaiser (John DiMaggio) assures her that she acted appropriately during the test and met the test&#x27;s targets. Clearly upset and traumatized that Duo wasn&#x27;t real, Cis angrily punches him in the face and walks away. Shocked and impressed by her behavior, Kaiser remarks that &quot;except from that last part, I&#x27;d say she passed.&quot;

Cis made her first appearance as an image in The Matrix Revisited.

=== &quot;World Record&quot; ===
The beginning of this short includes a brief narration from the Instructor (implying that this segment is a Zion Archive file) explaining details behind the discovery of the Matrix by &quot;plugged-in&quot; humans. Only exceptional humans tend to become aware of the Matrix, those who have &quot;a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity, and a questioning nature&quot;, all qualities which are used to identify inconsistencies in the Matrix. This is not without exceptions, given that &quot;some attain this wisdom through wholly different means.&quot;

The story is about Dan Davis, a track athlete, who is competing in the 100 m in the Summer Olympic Games. He has set a world record time of 8.99 seconds, but his subsequent gold medal was revoked due to alleged drug use. He decides to compete again and break his own record to &quot;prove them wrong.&quot; Despite support from his father and a young reporter, Dan&#x27;s trainer tells him that he is physically unfit to race and that pushing himself too hard will cause a career-ending injury or worse. Despite this, Dan is adamant on racing.

On the day of the race, he is monitored by four Agents in the stadium. The race begins and Dan starts off strong. However, the muscles in his leg violently rupture, putting him at a setback and scaring many of the people in the stands, including his trainer. Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, the Agents detect that his &quot;signal&quot; is getting unstable in the Matrix due to his massive burst of energy. Three of the agents possess the three closest runners and try to stop him, but are unable to catch up to him in time.

The burst of energy causes Dan to be suddenly unplugged from the Matrix and wake up in his power-station pod, where he sees the real world through his pod. A Sentinel employs electrical restraints to secure him back in his pod. Dan&#x27;s mind is immediately thrown back into the Matrix, where his body is instantly exhausted from the race and Dan violently collapses to the ground at high speed. Despite this, he easily wins the race and breaks his original time of 8.99 seconds with a time of 8.72 seconds. The next scene shows a crippled and catatonic Dan being wheeled through a hospital. A nearby Agent calls his other agents to tell them that they erased Dan&#x27;s memory of the race and that he will never walk again, nor be an issue for them. However, Dan suddenly whispers the word &quot;Free&quot;, angering the agent. Dan then stands, breaking the metal screws that bind his restraints to his wheelchair, and takes a few steps before helplessly falling down and being helped up by a nurse.

=== &quot;Kid&#x27;s Story&quot; ===
&quot;Kid&#x27;s Story&quot; is the only one of the animated shorts contained in &quot;The Animatrix&quot; in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) appears, though as a shadow. The story takes place during the six-month gap between &quot;The Matrix&quot; and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, where Neo has joined the crew of the &quot;Nebuchadnezzar&quot; and is helping the rebels free other humans from the Matrix. Kid (Clayton Watson), who was formerly known as Michael Karl Popper (a reference to the philosopher of science arguing that a single counterexample can refute a scientific theory), is a disaffected teenager who feels there is something wrong with the world. One night, the Kid goes on his computer and onto a hacker chat room on the Internet, asking why it feels more real when he&#x27;s dreaming than when he&#x27;s awake. He gets a response from an unknown person (presumably Neo) and then he asks who it is and if he is alone.

The next day, he is at school, where he absent-mindedly scribbles Neo and Trinity&#x27;s name and writes &quot;get me out of here&quot; in his notebook. He receives a call from Neo on his cell phone, who warns him that a group of Agents is coming for him and he gets chased throughout the high school, before ultimately getting cornered on the roof. He calmly asserts his faith in Neo and throws himself off the roof. At the Kid&#x27;s funeral, among the people is his teacher, who converses with another school staff member and says that the world they live in is not real and the real world is somewhere else. He also says that reality can be scary and the world must have been a harmful place for the Kid and that at the very least, he is now in a better world.

The next scene fades out as the Kid awakens in the real world to see Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) watching over him. They remark that he has achieved &quot;self substantiation&quot; (removing oneself from the Matrix without external aid), which was considered impossible. In both the scene and &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, the Kid believes that it was Neo who saved him, but Neo tells him that he saved himself. The last scene shows the Kid&#x27;s last question on the hacker chat room being answered with &quot;You are not alone.&quot;

=== &quot;Beyond&quot; ===
&quot;Beyond&quot; follows a 14-year-old girl, Yoko (Hedy Burress), looking for her cat Yuki. While asking around the neighborhood, which is somewhere in a megacity that resembles Tokyo, she meets a group of young boys. One of them tells her that Yuki is inside a nearby haunted house where they usually play.

The haunted house is an old run-down building filled with an amalgamation of anomalies, which are revealed to be glitches in the Matrix, that the children have stumbled across. They have learned to exploit them for their own enjoyment, through several areas which seem to defy real-world physics. The boys play with glass bottles that reassemble after being shattered and they go into a large open space in the middle of the building that has a zero gravity effect. Meanwhile, as Yoko searches for Yuki throughout the building, she encounters some anomalies on her own. She goes through an area where broken lightbulbs flicker briefly (during which they seem intact), walks into a room where rain is falling from a sunny sky and goes down a hallway where a gust of wind appears and disappears. She finally finds Yuki outside on a concrete pavement where she sees shadows that do not align with their physical origins. Yoko then joins the boys in the open space, where she sees a dove feather rotating rapidly in mid-air and experiences the zero gravity as she falls to the ground slowly and safely. She and the boys start using the zero gravity force to float, jump high and do athletic stunts all in mid-air and can also land and fall without hitting the ground hard. Despite the inherent strangeness of the place, the group is not bothered with this, as they enjoy themselves and the mysterious anomaly that proves to be amusing.

Throughout the film, brief sequences show that Agents are aware of the problem in the Matrix, and a truck is seen driving toward the site to presumably deal with the problem. It arrives just as the children are having trouble with a large group of rats and an Agent-led team of rodent exterminators emerges from the truck. In the building, when Yoko finds a missing Yuki again, she sees one last anomaly where she opens a door that leads into an endless dark void before being found by the exterminators. The team clears everybody out of the building. The story ends when Yoko returns to the area the next day and finds the site turned into an unremarkable parking lot. She sees the boys unsuccessfully attempting to recreate the bizarre occurrences of the day before and going in search of something else to do.

=== &quot;A Detective Story&quot; ===
This prequel story follows a private detective, Ash (James Arnold Taylor), who dreamed of following in the steps of hard-boiled characters Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe but is a down-on-his-luck detective. One day, he receives an anonymous phone call to search for a hacker going by the alias &quot;Trinity&quot; (Carrie-Anne Moss). Ash starts looking for Trinity and learns that other detectives have failed in the same task before him; one committed suicide, one went missing, and one went insane.

Eventually, Ash finds Trinity after deducing that he should communicate using phrases and facts from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. She proposes a meeting and he finds her on a passenger train. When he meets her, she removes a &quot;bug&quot; from his eye, planted by Agents earlier in an &quot;eye exam,&quot; which Ash previously thought was a dream. Three Agents immediately appear and attempt to apprehend Trinity in a shoot-out with her and Ash. While the two are trying to escape, an Agent attempts to take over Ash&#x27;s body, forcing Trinity to shoot him to prevent the Agent from completing his possession. Ash is wounded and bleeding, whereupon he and Trinity amicably bid farewell. Trinity tells Ash that she genuinely thinks he could have handled the truth as she jumps out of a window and escapes. The Agents enter the train to find Ash, who calmly points his gun at them while looking in the other direction and lighting a cigarette. The Agents turn to Ash who, even though he is armed, will likely die regardless of what they do with him. With this apparent no-win situation, the film ends with Ash&#x27;s line, &quot;A case to end all cases,&quot; as his lighter flame goes out.

The film deals with a group of above-ground human rebels who lure hostile machines to their laboratory to capture them and insert them into a &quot;matrix&quot; of their own design. Within this matrix, the humans attempt to teach the captured machines some of the positive traits of humanity, primarily compassion and empathy. The rebels&#x27; hope is that, once converted of its own volition (a key point discussed in the film), an &quot;enlightened&quot; machine will willingly assist Zion in its struggle against the machine-controlled totalitarianism which currently dominates the Earth.

The film starts with a human woman Alexa (Melinda Clarke) looking out over the sea, watching for incoming machines, where she sees two &quot;runners,&quot; one of the most intelligent robots, approaching. She leads them into the laboratory, where one runner gets ambushed and killed by a reprogrammed robot, but the second runner kills the robot before Alexa electrocutes it, knocking out the runner. The rebels insert the runner into their matrix. The robot experiences moments of mystery, horror, wonder and excitement, leading it to believe it may have an emotional bond with Alexa.

However, the laboratory is attacked by Sentinel reinforcements. The rebels unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, along with the help of other captured machines (indicated by the machine&#x27;s mechanical eyes changing from red to green). Alexa unplugs the runner that has now turned good, where it saves her from a machine. The rebels and the attacking machines are all killed or destroyed, except for the runner. The robot plugs the dying Alexa and itself into the rebels&#x27; matrix. When Alexa realizes that she is trapped inside of the matrix with the runner, she is horrified and her avatar screams and dissolves as the runner exits from the rebels&#x27; matrix to see a dead Alexa in front of him in the real world.

The film ends with the &quot;converted&quot; runner standing outside, looking out over the sea, in a replica of the opening shot with Alexa.

Development of the &quot;Animatrix&quot; project began when the film series&#x27; writers and directors, The Wachowskis, were in Japan promoting the first &quot;Matrix&quot; film. While in the country, they visited some of the creators of the anime films that had been a strong influence on their work, and decided to collaborate with them.

&quot;The Animatrix&quot; was conceived and overseen by the Wachowskis, but they only wrote four of the segments themselves and did not direct any of their animation; most of the project&#x27;s technical side was overseen by notable figures from the world of Japanese animation.

The English language version of &quot;The Animatrix&quot; was directed by Jack Fletcher, who brought on board the project the voice actors who provided the voices for the English version of Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, including Matt McKenzie, James Arnold Taylor, John DiMaggio, Tara Strong, Hedy Burress, and Dwight Schultz. The English version also features the voices of Victor Williams, Melinda Clarke, Olivia d&#x27;Abo, Pamela Adlon, and Kevin Michael Richardson.

The characters Neo, Trinity, and Kid also appear, with their voices provided by their original actors, Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Clayton Watson.

== Music ==
The Animatrix: The Album is a 2003 soundtrack album from &quot;The Animatrix&quot; collection films. The soundtrack was composed by Don Davis. Several electronic music artists are featured, including Juno Reactor and Adam Freeland.

== Release ==

Four of the films were originally released on the series&#x27; official website; one (&quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot;) was shown in cinemas with the film &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot;. The others first appeared with the VHS and DVD release of all nine shorts on June 3, 2003. The DVD also includes the following special features:
* A documentary on Japanese animation. The on-screen title is &quot;Scrolls to Screen: A Brief History of Anime&quot;, but in the DVD menu and packaging, and on the series&#x27; official website, it is referred to as &quot;Scrolls to Screen: The History and Culture of Anime&quot;.
* Seven featurettes with director profiles, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage of each of the films.
* Audio commentaries on &quot;World Record&quot;, &quot;Program&quot;, and both parts of &quot;The Second Renaissance&quot;.
* A trailer for the video game &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;.

Shortly after the home video release, the film was exhibited on June 14, 2003, in New York City at the New York-Tokyo Film Festival.

It was broadcast on Adult Swim on April 17, 2004 (to promote the DVD release of &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot;) and again on its Toonami programming block on December 19, 2021 (to promote &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;) (albeit with edits done to remove nudity and gory violence in &quot;The Second Renaissance Parts 1 and 2&quot;), and has received airplay on Teletoon several months after its American broadcast. In the UK, &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; was broadcast on Channel 5 just before the DVD release, along with &quot;The Second Renaissance Parts 1 and 2&quot;, &quot;Kid&#x27;s Story&quot; and &quot;World Record&quot; broadcast after the DVD release.

In May 2006, &quot;The Animatrix&quot; was aired in Latin America and in Spain by Cartoon Network on Toonami.

&quot;The Animatrix&quot; was also screened in select cinemas around the world for a short period of time, a week or two before the sequel &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, as a promotional event.

One day before the release of &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; on cinemas, the Brazilian television channel SBT aired &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; after airing &quot;The Matrix&quot; to promote the film. The same thing happened with French television channel France 2.

The cinema release order for &quot;The Animatrix&quot; (at least in Australia), and its sequencing in a subsequent release on HBO Max, differed from the DVD release, placing the &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; last instead of first. The cinema release-order:

# &quot;The Second Renaissance, Part I&quot; (June 3, 2003)
# &quot;The Second Renaissance, Part II&quot; (June 7, 2003)
# &quot;Kid&#x27;s Story&quot; (June 14, 2003)
# &quot;Program&quot; (June 21, 2003)
# &quot;World Record&quot; (July 5, 2003)
# &quot;Beyond&quot; (July 12, 2003)
# &quot;A Detective Story&quot; (August 30, 2003)
# &quot;Matriculated&quot; (September 20, 2003)
# &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; (September 27, 2003)

To coincide with the Blu-ray edition of &quot;The Ultimate Matrix Collection&quot;, &quot;The Animatrix&quot; was also presented for the first time in high definition. The film was released along with the trilogy on October 14, 2008.

&quot;The Animatrix&quot; saw a one night only screening in 35mm at New York City&#x27;s Japan Society on May 27, 2022.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Animatrix&quot; sold 2.7million copies, grossing in sales revenue.

&quot;The Animatrix&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 89%, based on reviews from 18 critics. Helen McCarthy in &quot;500 Essential Anime Movies&quot; stated that &quot;unlike many heavily promoted franchise movies, it justifies its hype&quot;. She praised Maeda&#x27;s &quot;Second Renaissance&quot;, noting that it &quot;foreshadows the dazzling visual inventiveness of his later &quot;&quot;&quot;.

<text>The Boeing 2707 was an American supersonic passenger airliner project during the 1960s. After winning a competition for a government-funded contract to build an American supersonic airliner, Boeing began development at its facilities in Seattle, Washington. The design emerged as a large aircraft with seating for 250 to 300 passengers and cruise speeds of approximately Mach 3. It was intended to be much larger and faster than competing supersonic transport (SST) designs such as the Concorde.

The SST was the topic of considerable concern within and outside the aviation industry. From the start, the airline industry noted that the economics of the design were questionable, concerns that were only partially addressed during development. Outside the field, the entire SST concept was the subject of considerable negative press, centered on the issue of sonic booms and effects on the ozone layer.

A key design feature of the 2707 was its use of a swing-wing configuration. During development, the required weight and size of this mechanism continued to grow, forcing the team to switch to a conventional delta wing. Rising costs, environmental concerns, noise, and the lack of a clear market led to its cancellation in 1971 before two prototypes were completed.

==Development==

===Early studies===
Boeing worked on a number of small-scale SST studies since 1952. In 1958, it established a permanent research committee, which grew to a $1 million effort by 1960. The committee proposed a variety of alternative designs, all under the name Model 733. Most of the designs featured a large delta wing, but in 1959 another design was offered as an offshoot of Boeing&#x27;s efforts in the swing-wing TFX program (which led to the purchase of the General Dynamics F-111 instead of the Boeing offering). In 1960, an internal competition was run on a baseline 150-seat aircraft for trans-Atlantic routes, and the swing-wing version won.

Shortly after taking office, President John F. Kennedy tasked the Federal Aviation Administration with preparing a report on &quot;national aviation goals for the period between now and 1970&quot;. The study was prompted in the wake of several accidents, which led to the belief that the industry was becoming moribund. Two projects were started, Project Beacon on new navigational systems and air traffic control, and Project Horizon on advanced civil aviation developments.
Only one month later the FAA&#x27;s new director, Najeeb Halaby, produced the Commission on National Aviation Goals, better known as Project Horizon. Among other suggestions, the report was used as a platform to promote the SST. Halaby argued that a failure to enter this market would be a &quot;stunning setback&quot;. The report was met with skepticism by most others. Kennedy had put Lyndon Johnson on the SST file, and he turned to Robert McNamara for guidance. McNamara was highly skeptical of the SST project and savaged Halaby&#x27;s predictions; he was also afraid the project might be turned over to the DoD and was careful to press for further studies.

The basic concept behind the SST was that its fast flight would allow them to fly more trips than a subsonic aircraft, leading to higher utilization. However, it did this at the cost of greatly increased fuel use. If fuel costs were to change dramatically, SSTs would not be competitive. These problems were well understood within the industry; the IATA released a set of &quot;design imperatives&quot; for an SST that were essentially impossible to meet—the release was a warning to promoters of the SST within the industry.

===Concorde===
By mid-1962, it was becoming clear that tentative talks earlier that year between the British Aircraft Corporation and Sud Aviation (later Aérospatiale) on a merger of their SST projects were more serious than originally thought. In November 1962, still to the surprise of many, the Concorde project was announced. In spite of marginal economics, nationalistic and political arguments had led to wide support for the project, especially from Charles de Gaulle. This set off something of a wave of panic in other countries, as it was widely believed that almost all future commercial aircraft would be supersonic, and it looked like the Europeans would start off with a huge lead. As if this were not enough, it soon became known that the Soviets were also working on a similar design.

Three days after the Concorde announcement, Halaby wrote a letter to Kennedy suggesting that if they did not immediately start their own SST effort, the US would lose 50,000 jobs, $4 billion in income, and $3 billion in capital as local carriers turned to foreign suppliers. A report from the Supersonic Transport Advisory Group (STAG) followed, noting that the European team was in the lead in basic development, and suggested competing by developing a more advanced design with better economics. At the time, more advanced generally meant higher speed. The baseline design in the report called for an aircraft with Mach 3 performance with range in order to serve the domestic market. They felt that there was no way to build a transatlantic design with that performance in time to catch the Concorde&#x27;s introduction, abandoning the trans-Atlantic market to the Europeans.

In spite of vocal opponents, questions about the technical requirements, and extremely negative reports about its economic viability, the SST project gathered strong backing from industry and the FAA. Johnson sent a report to the president asking for $100 million in funding for FY 1964. This might have been delayed, but in May, Pan Am announced they had placed 6 options on the Concorde. Juan Trippe leaked the information earlier that month, stating that the airline would not ignore the SST market, and would buy from Europe if need be. Pan Am&#x27;s interest in Concorde angered Kennedy, who called his administration to get Pan Am to redirect its potential funding back to the US SST program.

Kennedy introduced the National Supersonic Transport program on June 5, 1963, in a speech at the US Air Force Academy.

===Design competition===
Requests for proposals were sent out to airframe manufacturers Boeing, Lockheed, and North American for the airframes; and Curtiss-Wright, General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney for engines. The FAA estimated that there would be a market for 500 SSTs by 1990. Despite not having a selected design, orders from air carriers started flowing in immediately. Preliminary designs were submitted to the FAA on January 15, 1964.
Boeing&#x27;s entry was essentially identical to the swing-wing Model 733 studied in 1960; it was known officially as the Model , but also referred to both as the 1966 Model and the Model 2707. The latter name became the best known in public, while Boeing continued to use 733 model numbers internally. The design resembled the future B-1 Lancer bomber, with the exception that the four engines were mounted in individual nacelles instead of paired pods used on the Lancer. The blended wing root spanned almost all of cabin area, and this early version had a much more stubby look than the models that would ultimately evolve. The wing featured extensive high-lift devices on both the leading and trailing edges, minimizing the thrust required, and thus noise created, during climb out. The proposal also included optional fuselage stretches that increased capacity from the normal 150 seats to 227.

Lockheed&#x27;s entry, designated CL-823, was essentially an enlarged Concorde. Like the Concorde, it featured a long and skinny fuselage, engines under the wing, and a compound delta planform. The only major design difference was the use of individual pods for the engines, rather than pairs. The CL-823 lacked any form of high-lift devices on the wings, relying on engine power and long runways for liftoff, ensuring a huge noise footprint. The CL-823 was the largest of the first-round entries, with typical seating for 218.

The North American NAC-60 was essentially a scaled-up B-70 with a less tapered fuselage and new compound-delta wing. The design retained the high-mounted canard above the cockpit area, and the box-like engine area under the fuselage. The use of high-lift devices on the leading edge of the wing lowered the landing angles to the point where the &quot;drooping nose&quot; was not required, and a more conventional rounded design was used. Compared to the other designs, the rounded nose profile and more cylindrical cross-section gave the NAC-60 a decidedly more conventional look than the other entries. This also meant it would fly slower, at Mach 2.65.

A &quot;downselect&quot; of the proposed models resulted in the NAC-60 and Curtiss-Wright efforts being dropped from the program, with both Boeing and Lockheed asked to offer SST models meeting the more demanding FAA requirements and able to use either of the remaining engine designs from GE or P&amp;W. In November, another design review was held, and by this time Boeing had scaled up the original design into a 250-seat model, the &quot;Model 733-290&quot;. Due to concerns about jet blast, the four engines were moved to a position underneath an enlarged tailplane. When the wings were in their swept-back position, they merged with the tailplane to produce a delta-wing planform.

Both companies were now asked for considerably more detailed proposals, to be presented for final selection in 1966. When this occurred, Boeing&#x27;s design was now the 300-seat &quot;Model 733-390&quot;. Both the Boeing and Lockheed L-2000 designs were presented in September 1966 along with full-scale mock-ups. After a lengthy review the Boeing design was announced as the winner on January 1, 1967. The design would be powered by the General Electric GE4/J5 engines. Lockheed&#x27;s L-2000 was judged simpler to produce and less risky, but its performance was slightly lower and its noise levels slightly higher.

===Refining the design===
The 733-390 would have been an advanced aircraft even if it had been only subsonic. It was one of the earliest wide-body aircraft designs, with 2-3-2 row seating arrangement at its widest section in a fuselage that was considerably wider than aircraft then in service. The SST mock-up included both overhead storage for smaller items with restraining nets, as well as large drop-in bins between sections of the aircraft. In the main 247-seat tourist-class cabin, the entertainment system consisted of retractable televisions placed between every sixth row in the overhead storage. In the 30-seat first-class area, every pair of seats included smaller televisions in a console between the seats. Windows were only due to the high altitudes the aircraft flew at maximizing the pressure on them, but the internal pane was to give an illusion of size.

Boeing predicted that if the go-ahead were given, construction of the SST prototypes would begin in early 1967 and the first flight could be made in early 1970. Production aircraft could start being built in early 1969, with the flight testing in late 1972 and certification by mid-1974.

A major change in the design came when Boeing added canards behind the nose—which added weight. Boeing also faced insurmountable weight problems due to the swing-wing mechanism, a titanium pivot section having been fabricated with a weight of and measuring long and thick, and the design could not achieve sufficient range. Flexing of the fuselage (it would have been the longest ever built) threatened to make control difficult. In October 1968, the company was finally forced to abandon the variable geometry wing. The Boeing team fell back on a tailed delta fixed wing. The new design was also smaller, seating 234, and known as the &quot;Model 2707-300&quot;. Work began on a full-sized mock-up and two prototypes in September 1969, now two years behind schedule.

A promotional film claimed that airlines would soon pay back the federal investment in the project, and it was projected that SSTs would dominate the skies with subsonic jumbo jets (such as Boeing&#x27;s 747) being only a passing intermediate fad.

By October 1969, there were delivery positions reserved for 122 Boeing SSTs by 26 airlines, including Alitalia, Canadian Pacific Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Iberia, KLM, Northwest Airlines, and World Airways.

=== Environmental concerns ===
By this point, the opposition to the project was becoming increasingly vocal. Environmentalists were the most influential group, voicing concerns about possible depletion of the ozone layer due to the high altitude flights, and about noise at airports, as well as from sonic booms.

The latter became the most significant rallying point, especially after the publication of the anti-SST paperback, &quot;SST and Sonic Boom Handbook&quot; edited by William Shurcliff, which claimed that a single flight would &quot;leave a &#x27;bang-zone&#x27; wide by long&quot; along with a host of associated problems. During tests in 1964 with the XB-70 near Oklahoma City, the path had a maximum width of , but still resulted in 9,594 complaints of damage to buildings, 4,629 formal damage claims, and 229 claims for a total of $12,845.32, mostly for broken glass and cracked plaster. As the opposition widened, the claimed negative effects increased, including upsetting people who do delicate work (e.g., brain surgeons), and harming persons with nervous ailments.

One concern was that the water vapor released by the engines into the stratosphere would envelop the earth in a &quot;global gloom&quot;. Presidential Adviser Russell Train warned that a fleet of 500 SSTs flying at for a period of years could raise stratospheric water content by as much as 50% to 100%. According to Train, this could lead to greater ground-level heat and hamper the formation of ozone. Later, an additional threat to the ozone was found in the exhaust&#x27;s nitrogen oxides, a threat that was later validated by MIT. More recent analysis in 1995 by David W. Fahey, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and others found that the drop in ozone would be from 1 to 2% if a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft was operated. Fahey expressed the opinion that this would not be a fatal obstacle for an advanced SST development.

During the 1970s the alleged potential for serious ozone damage and the sonic boom worries were picked up by the Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation and the Wilderness Society. Supersonic flight over land in the United States was eventually banned, and several states added additional restrictions or banned Concorde outright.

Senator William Proxmire (D-Wisconsin) criticized the SST program as frivolous federal spending. 

Halaby attempted to dismiss these concerns, stating &quot;The supersonics are coming−as surely as tomorrow. You will be flying one version or another by 1980 and be trying to remember what the great debate was all about.&quot;

=== Government funding cut ===
In March 1971, despite the project&#x27;s strong support by the administration of President Richard Nixon, the U.S. Senate rejected further funding. A counterattack was organized under the banner of the &quot;National Committee for an American SST&quot;, which urged supporters to send in $1 to keep the program alive. Afterward, letters of support from aviation buffs, containing nearly $1 million worth of contributions, poured in. Labor unions also supported the SST project, worried that the winding down of both the Vietnam War and Apollo program would lead to mass unemployment in the aerospace sector. AFL–CIO President George Meany suggested that the race to develop a first-generation SST was already lost, but the US should &quot;enter the competition for the second generation—the SSTs of the 1980s and 1990s&quot;.

Despite this newfound support, the House of Representatives also voted to end SST funding on May 20, 1971. The vote was highly contentious. Gerald Ford, then Republican Leader, shouted Meany&#x27;s claims that &quot;If you vote for the SST, you are ensuring 13,000 jobs today plus 50,000 jobs in the second tier and 150,000 jobs each year over the next ten years.&quot; Sidney Yates, leading the &quot;no&quot; camp, offered a then-uncommon motion to instruct conferees and eventually won the vote against further funding, 215 to 204.

At the time, there were 115 unfilled orders by 25 airlines, while Concorde had 74 orders from 16 customers. The prototypes by Boeing and Lockheed were never completed. Due to the loss of several government contracts and a downturn in the civilian aviation market, Boeing reduced its number of employees by more than 60,000. The SST became known as &quot;the airplane that almost ate Seattle.&quot; As a result of the mass layoffs and so many people moving away from the city in search of work, a billboard was erected near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport in 1971 that read, &quot;Will the last person leaving Seattle – turn out the lights&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===
The SST race has had several lasting effects on the industry as a whole. The supercritical wing was originally developed as part of the SST efforts in the U.S., but is now widely used on most jet aircraft. In Europe, the cooperation that allowed Concorde led to the formation of Airbus, Boeing&#x27;s foremost competitor, with Aérospatiale becoming a main component of Airbus.

When Concorde was launched, sales were predicted to be 150 aircraft, but only 14 aircraft were built for commercial service. Service entry was only secured through large government funding subsidy. These few aircraft went on to have a very long in-service flight life and were claimed to be ultimately commercially successful for their operators, until finally removed from service in the aftermath of the type&#x27;s only crash in 2000 and the 9/11 terrorist attacks when Airbus decided to end servicing arrangements.

Its Soviet counterpart, the Tupolev Tu-144, was less successful, operating for only 55 passenger flights before being permanently grounded for various reasons.

With the ending of the 2707 project, the entire SST field in the U.S. was moribund for some time. By the mid-1970s, minor advances, combined, appeared to offer greatly improved performance. Through the second half of the 1970s, NASA provided funding for the Advanced Supersonic Transport (AST) project at several companies, including McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, and Lockheed. Considerable wind tunnel testing of the various models was carried out at NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center.

Ultimately, supersonic passenger service was not economically competitive, and ceased with the retirement of Concorde in 2003; , no commercial supersonic aircraft operate in the world, due largely to poor fuel economy and high maintenance costs.

=== Legacy ===
The Museum of Flight in Seattle parks a British Airways Concorde a few blocks from the building where the original 2707 mockup was housed in Seattle. While the Soviet Tu-144 had a short service life, Concorde was successful enough to fly as a small luxury fleet from 1976 until 2003, with British Airways lifetime costs of £1bn producing £1.75bn in revenues in the niche transatlantic market. As the most advanced supersonic transports became some of the oldest airframes in the fleet, profits eventually fell, due to rising maintenance costs.

The final-configuration Boeing 2707 mockup was sold to a museum and displayed at the SST Aviation Exhibit Center in Kissimmee, Florida, from 1973 to 1981. In 1983, the building, complete with SST, was purchased by the Faith World church. For years the Osceola New Life Assembly of God held services there with the airplane still standing above. In 1990, the mock-up was sold to aircraft restorer Charles Bell, who moved it, in pieces, to Merritt Island, in order to preserve it while it waited for a new home as the church now wanted the space for expansion. The forward fuselage was on display at the Hiller Aviation Museum of San Carlos, California, for many years, but in early 2013, was moved back to Seattle, where it is undergoing restoration at the Museum of Flight.

Seattle&#x27;s NBA basketball team, formed in 1967, was named the Seattle SuperSonics (shortened to &quot;Sonics&quot;). The name was inspired by the newly won SST contract.

<doc id="180609" wikidata="Q471880" url="?curid=180609" title="Identity theft">
<text>Identity theft, identity piracy or identity infringement occurs when someone uses another&#x27;s personal identifying information, like their name, identifying number, or credit card number, without their permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. The term &quot;identity theft&quot; was coined in 1964. Since that time, the definition of identity theft has been legally defined throughout both the UK and the U.S. as the theft of personally identifiable information. Identity theft deliberately uses someone else&#x27;s identity as a method to gain financial advantages or obtain credit and other benefits. The person whose identity has been stolen may suffer adverse consequences, especially if they are falsely held responsible for the perpetrator&#x27;s actions. Personally identifiable information generally includes a person&#x27;s name, date of birth, social security number, driver&#x27;s license number, bank account or credit card numbers, PINs, electronic signatures, fingerprints, passwords, or any other information that can be used to access a person&#x27;s financial resources.

Determining the link between data breaches and identity theft is challenging, primarily because identity theft victims often do not know how their personal information was obtained. According to a report done for the FTC, identity theft is not always detectable by the individual victims. Identity fraud is often but not necessarily the consequence of identity theft. Someone can steal or misappropriate personal information without then committing identity theft using the information about every person, such as when a major data breach occurs. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study determined that &quot;most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft&quot;. The report also warned that &quot;the full extent is unknown&quot;. A later unpublished study by Carnegie Mellon University noted that &quot;Most often, the causes of identity theft is not known&quot;, but reported that someone else concluded that &quot;the probability of becoming a victim to identity theft as a result of a data breach is ... around only 2%&quot;. For example, in one of the largest data breaches which affected over four million records, it resulted in only about 1,800 instances of identity theft, according to the company whose systems were breached.

An October 2010 article entitled &quot;Cyber Crime Made Easy&quot; explained the level to which hackers are using malicious software. As Gunter Ollmann,
Chief Technology Officer of security at Microsoft, said, &quot;Interested in credit card theft? There&#x27;s an app for that.&quot; This statement summed up the ease with which these hackers are accessing all kinds of information online. The new program for infecting users&#x27; computers was called Zeus, and the program is so hacker-friendly that even an inexperienced hacker can operate it. Although the hacking program is easy to use, that fact does not diminish the devastating effects that Zeus (or other software like Zeus) can do on a computer and the user. For example, programs like Zeus can steal credit card information, important documents, and even documents necessary for homeland security. If a hacker were to gain this information, it would mean nationwide identity theft or even a possible terrorist attack. The ITAC said that about 15 million Americans had their identity stolen in 2012.

== Types ==

Sources such as the Non-profit Identity Theft Resource Center sub-divide identity theft into five categories:
* Criminal identity theft (posing as another person when apprehended for a crime)
* Financial identity theft (using another&#x27;s identity to obtain credit, goods, and services)
* Identity cloning (using another&#x27;s information to assume his or her identity in daily life)
* Medical identity theft (using another&#x27;s identity to obtain medical care or drugs)
* Child identity theft.

Identity theft may be used to facilitate or fund other crimes including illegal immigration, terrorism, phishing and espionage. There are cases of identity cloning to attack payment systems, including online credit card processing and medical insurance.

=== Identity cloning and concealment ===
In this situation, the identity thief impersonates someone else to conceal their own true identity. Examples are illegal immigrants hiding their illegal status, people hiding from creditors or other individuals and those who simply want to become &quot;anonymous&quot; for personal reasons. Another example is &quot;posers&quot;, a label given to people who use someone else&#x27;s photos and information on social networking sites. Posers mostly create believable stories involving friends of the real person they are imitating. Unlike identity theft used to obtain credit which usually comes to light when the debts mount, concealment may continue indefinitely without being detected, particularly if the identity thief can obtain false credentials to pass various authentication tests in everyday life.

=== Criminal identity theft ===
When a criminal fraudulently identifies themselves to police as another individual at the point of arrest, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Criminal Identity Theft.&quot; In some cases, criminals have previously obtained state-issued identity documents using credentials stolen from others, or have simply presented a fake ID. Provided the subterfuge works, charges may be placed under the victim&#x27;s name, letting the criminal off the hook. Victims might only learn of such incidents by chance, for example by receiving a court summons, discovering their driver&#x27;s licenses are suspended when stopped for minor traffic violations, or through background checks performed for employment purposes.

It can be difficult for the victim of criminal identity theft to clear their record. The steps required to clear the victim&#x27;s incorrect criminal record depend on which jurisdiction the crime occurred and whether the true identity of the criminal can be determined. The victim might need to locate the original arresting officers and prove their own identity by some reliable means such as fingerprinting or DNA testing and may need to go to a court hearing to be cleared of the charges. Obtaining an expungement of court records may also be required. Authorities might permanently maintain the victim&#x27;s name as an alias for the criminal&#x27;s true identity in their criminal records databases. One problem that victims of criminal identity theft may encounter is that various data aggregators might still have incorrect criminal records in their databases even after court and police records are corrected. Thus a future background check may return the incorrect criminal records. This is just one example of the kinds of impact that may continue to affect the victims of identity theft for some months or even years after the crime, aside from the psychological trauma that being &#x27;cloned&#x27; typically engenders.

=== Synthetic identity theft ===
A variation of identity theft that has recently become more common is &quot;synthetic identity theft&quot;, in which identities are completely or partially fabricated. The most common technique involves combining a real social security number with a name and birthdate other than the ones that are simply associated with the number. Synthetic identity theft is more difficult to track as it doesn&#x27;t show on either person&#x27;s credit report directly but may appear as an entirely new file in the credit bureau or as a subfile on one of the victim&#x27;s credit reports. Synthetic identity theft primarily harms the creditors who unwittingly grant the fraudsters credit. Individual victims can be affected if their names become confused with the synthetic identities, or if negative information in their subfiles impacts their credit ratings.

=== Medical identity theft ===

Privacy researcher Pam Dixon, the founder of the World Privacy Forum, coined the term medical identity theft and released the first major report about this issue in 2006. In the report, she defined the crime for the first time and made the plight of victims public. The report&#x27;s definition of the crime is that medical identity theft occurs when someone seeks medical care under the identity of another person. Insurance theft is also very common, if a thief has your insurance information and or your insurance card, they can seek medical attention posing as yourself. In addition to risks of financial harm common to all forms of identity theft, the thief&#x27;s medical history may be added to the victim&#x27;s medical records. Inaccurate information in the victim&#x27;s records is difficult to correct and may affect future insurability or cause doctors to rely on misinformation to deliver inappropriate care. After the publication of the report, which contained a recommendation that consumers receive notifications of medical data breach incidents, California passed a law requiring this, and then finally HIPAA was expanded to also require medical breach notification when breaches affect 500 or more people. Data collected and stored by hospitals and other organizations such as medical aid schemes is up to 10 times more valuable to cybercriminals than credit card information.

=== Child identity theft ===
Child identity theft occurs when a minor&#x27;s identity is used by another person for the impostor&#x27;s personal gain. The impostor can be a family member, a friend, or even a stranger who targets children. The Social Security numbers of children are valued because they do not have any information associated with them. Thieves can establish lines of credit, obtain driver&#x27;s licenses, or even buy a house using a child&#x27;s identity. This fraud can go undetected for years, as most children do not discover the problem until years later. Child identity theft is fairly common, and studies have shown that the problem is growing. The largest study on child identity theft, as reported by Richard Power of the Carnegie Mellon Cylab with data supplied by AllClear ID, found that of 40,000 children, 10.2% were victims of identity theft.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimates that about nine million people will be victims of identity theft in the United States per year. It was also estimated that in 2008; 630,000 people under the age of 19 were victims of theft. This then gave the victims a debt of about $12,799.

Not only are children in general big targets of identity theft but children who are in foster care are even bigger targets. This is because they are most likely moved around quite frequently and their SSN is being shared with multiple people and agencies. Foster children are even more victims of identity theft within their own families and other relatives. Young people in foster care who are victims of this crime are usually left alone to struggle and figure out how to fix their newly formed bad credit.

The emergence of children&#x27;s identities on social media has also contributed to a rise in incidents of digital kidnapping and identity theft. Digital kidnapping involves individuals stealing online images of children and misrepresenting them as their own.

=== Financial identity theft ===
The most common type of identity theft is related to finance. Financial identity theft includes obtaining credit, loans, goods, and services while claiming to be someone else.

=== Tax identity theft ===

One of the major identity theft categories is tax-related identity theft. The most common method is to use a person&#x27;s authentic name, address, and Social Security Number to file a tax return with false information, and have the resulting refund direct-deposited into a bank account controlled by the thief. The thief in this case can also try to get a job and then their employer will report the income of the real taxpayer, this then results in the taxpayer getting in trouble with the IRS.

The 14039 Form to the IRS is a form that will help one fight against a theft like tax theft. This form will put the IRS on alert and someone who believed they have been a victim of tax-related theft will be given an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN), which is a 6 digit code used in replacing an SSN for filing tax returns.

== Techniques for obtaining and exploiting personal information ==
Identity thieves typically obtain and exploit personally identifiable information about individuals, or various credentials they use to authenticate themselves, to impersonate them. Examples include:
* Using public records about individual citizens, published in official registers such as electoral rolls
* Stealing cheques (checks) to acquire banking information, including account numbers and bank codes
* Guessing Social Security numbers by using information found on Internet social networks such as Twitter and MySpace

== Individual identity protection ==
The acquisition of personal identifiers is made possible through serious breaches of privacy. For consumers, this is usually a result of them naively providing their personal information or login credentials to the identity thieves (e.g., in a phishing attack) but identity-related documents such as credit cards, bank statements, utility bills, checkbooks, etc. may also be physically stolen from vehicles, homes, offices, and not the least letterboxes, or directly from victims by pickpockets and bag snatchers. Guardianship of personal identifiers by consumers is the most common intervention strategy recommended by the US Federal Trade Commission, Canadian Phone Busters and most sites that address identity theft. Such organizations offer recommendations on how individuals can prevent their information from falling into the wrong hands.

Identity theft can be partially mitigated by &quot;not&quot; identifying oneself unnecessarily (a form of information security control known as risk avoidance). This implies that organizations, IT systems, and procedures should not demand excessive amounts of personal information or credentials for identification and authentication. Requiring, storing, and processing personal identifiers (such as Social Security number, national identification number, driver&#x27;s license number, credit card number, etc.) increases the risks of identity theft unless this valuable personal information is adequately secured at all times. Committing personal identifiers to memory is a sound practice that can reduce the risks of a would-be identity thief from obtaining these records. To help in remembering numbers such as social security numbers and credit card numbers, it is helpful to consider using mnemonic techniques or memory aids such as the mnemonic Major System.

Identity thieves sometimes impersonate dead people, using personal information obtained from death notices, gravestones, and other sources to exploit delays between the death and the closure of the person&#x27;s accounts, the inattentiveness of grieving families, and weaknesses in the processes for credit-checking. Such crimes may continue for some time until the deceased&#x27;s families or the authorities notice and react to anomalies.

In recent years, commercial identity theft protection/insurance services have become available in many countries. These services purport to help protect the individual from identity theft or help detect that identity theft has occurred in exchange for a monthly or annual membership fee or premium. The services typically work either by setting fraud alerts on the individual&#x27;s credit files with the three major credit bureaus or by setting up credit report monitoring with the credit bureau. While identity theft protection/insurance services have been heavily marketed, their value has been called into question.

== Potential outcomes ==

Identity theft is a serious problem in the United States. In a 2018 study, it was reported that 60 million Americans&#x27; identities had been wrongfully acquired. In response, under advisement from the Identity Theft Resource Center, some new bills have been implemented to improve security such as requiring electronic signatures and social security verification.

Several types of identity theft are used to gather information, one of the most common types occurs when consumers make online purchases. A study was conducted with 190 people to determine the relationship between the constructs of fear of financial losses and reputational damages. The conclusions of this study revealed that identity theft was a positive correlation with reputable damages. The relationship between perceived risk and online purchase intention were negative. The significance of this study reveals that online companies are more aware of the potential harm that can be done to their consumers, therefore they are searching for ways to reduce the perceived risk of consumers and not lose out on business.

Victims of identity theft may face years of effort proving to the legal system that they are the true person, leading to emotional strain and financial losses. Most identity theft is perpetrated by a family member of the victim, and some may not be able to obtain new credit cards or open new bank accounts or loans.

== Identity protection by organizations ==
In their May 1998 testimony before the United States Senate, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) discussed the sale of Social Security numbers and other personal identifiers by credit-raters and data miners. The FTC agreed to the industry&#x27;s self-regulating principles restricting access to information on credit reports. According to the industry, the restrictions vary according to the category of customer. Credit reporting agencies gather and disclose personal and credit information to a wide business client base.

Poor stewardship of personal data by organizations, resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive data, can expose individuals to the risk of identity theft. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse has documented over 900 individual data breaches by US companies and government agencies since January 2005, which together have involved over 200 million total records containing sensitive personal information, many containing social security numbers. Poor corporate diligence standards which can result in data breaches include:
* failure to shred confidential information before throwing it into dumpsters
* failure to ensure adequate network security
* credit card numbers stolen by call center agents and people with access to call recordings
* the theft of laptop computers or portable media being carried off-site containing vast amounts of personal information. The use of strong encryption on these devices can reduce the chance of data being misused should a criminal obtain them.
* the brokerage of personal information to other businesses without ensuring that the purchaser maintains adequate security controls
* Failure of governments, when registering sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations, to determine if the officers listed in the Articles of Incorporation are who they say they are. This potentially allows criminals access to personal information through credit rating and data mining services.

The failure of corporate or government organizations to protect consumer privacy, client confidentiality and political privacy has been criticized for facilitating the acquisition of personal identifiers by criminals.

Using various types of biometric information, such as fingerprints, for identification and authentication has been cited as a way to thwart identity thieves, however, there are technological limitations and privacy concerns associated with these methods as well.

==Market==
There is an active market for buying and selling stolen personal information, which occurs mostly in darknet markets but also in other black markets. People increase the value of the stolen data by aggregating it with publicly available data, and sell it again for a profit, increasing the damage that can be done to the people whose data was stolen.

== Legal responses ==

=== International ===

In March 2014, after it was learned two passengers with stolen passports were on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which went missing on 8 March 2014. It came to light that Interpol maintains a database of 40 million lost and stolen travel documents from 157 countries, which Interpol makes available to governments and the public, including airlines and hotels. The Stolen and Lost Travel Documents (SLTD) database, however, is rarely used. &quot;Big News Network&quot; (which is based in the UAE) reported that Interpol Secretary-General Ronald K. Noble told a forum in Abu Dhabi in the previous month, &quot;The bad news is that, despite being incredibly cost-effective and deployable to virtually anywhere in the world, only a handful of countries are systematically using SLTD to screen travelers. The result is a major gap in our global security apparatus that is left vulnerable to exploitation by criminals and terrorists.&quot;

=== Australia ===
In Australia, each state has enacted laws that deal with different aspects of identity or fraud issues. Some states have now amended relevant criminal laws to reflect crimes of identity theft, such as the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA), Crimes Amendment (Fraud, Identity and Forgery Offences) Act 2009, and also in Queensland under the Criminal Code 1899 (QLD). Other states and territories are in states of development in respect of regulatory frameworks relating to identity theft such as Western Australia in respect of the Criminal Code Amendment (Identity Crime) Bill 2009.

At the Commonwealth level, under the &quot;Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery &amp; Related Offences) Act 2000&quot; which amended certain provisions within the &quot;Criminal Code Act 1995&quot;,

Between 2014 and 2015 in Australia, there were 133,921 fraud and deception offences, an increase of 6% from previous year. The total cost reported by the Attorney General Department was:

There are also high indirect costs associated as a direct result of an incident. For example, the total indirect costs for police recorded fraud is $5,774,081.

Likewise, each state has enacted its own privacy laws to prevent the misuse of personal information and data. The Commonwealth &quot;Privacy Act&quot; applies only to Commonwealth and territory agencies and to certain private-sector bodies (where, for example, they deal with sensitive records, such as medical records, or they have more than $3 million in turnover PA).

=== Canada ===
Under section 402.2 of the &quot;Criminal Code,&quot;
Under section 403 of the &quot;Criminal Code,&quot;
In Canada, &quot;Privacy Act&quot; (federal legislation) covers only federal government, agencies and crown corporations. Each province and territory has its own privacy law and privacy commissioners to limit the storage and use of personal data.
For the private sector, the purpose of the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (2000, c. 5) (known as PIPEDA) is to establish rules to govern the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information; except for the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia where provincial laws have been deemed substantially similar.

==== Proposed legislation ====
* Bill C-27 (39th Canadian Parliament, 2nd Session)

=== France ===
In France, a person convicted of identity theft can be sentenced up to five years in prison and fined up to €75,000.

=== Hong Kong ===
Under HK Laws. Chap 210 &quot;Theft Ordinance&quot;, sec. 16A Fraud:
The &quot;Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance&quot; (PDPO) regulates the collection, use and retention of personal information in Hong Kong. It also provides citizens the right to request information held by businesses and the government to the extent provided by this law. The PDPO establishes the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data which enforces the law and advises on the use of personal data.

=== India ===
Under the Information Technology Act 2000 Chapter IX Sec 66C:
=== Philippines ===
Social networking sites are one of the most famous spreaders of &quot;posers&quot; in the online community, giving the users the freedom to post any information they want without any verification that the account is being used by the real person.

The Philippines, which ranks eighth in the numbers of users of Facebook and other social networking sites (such as Twitter, Multiply and Tumblr), has been known as a source of various identity theft problems. Identities of people who carelessly put personal information on their profiles can easily be stolen just by simple browsing. Some people meet online, get to know each other through Facebook chat, and exchange messages that share private information. Others get romantically involved with online friends and end up sharing too much information (such as their social security number, bank account, home address, and company address).

This phenomenon leads to the creation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10175). Section 2 of this act states that it recognizes the importance of communication and multimedia for the development, exploitation, and dissemination of information, but violators will be punished by the law through imprisonment or a fine upwards of ₱200,000, but not exceeding ₱1,000,000, or (depending on the damage caused) both.

=== Sweden ===
Sweden has had relatively few problems with identity theft because only Swedish identity documents were accepted for identity verification. Stolen documents are traceable by banks and certain other institutions. Banks are required to check the identity of anyone withdrawing money or getting loans. If a bank gives money to someone using an identity document that has been reported as stolen, the bank must take this loss. Since 2008, any EU passport is valid in Sweden for identity verification, and Swedish passports are valid all over the EU. This makes it harder to detect stolen documents, but banks in Sweden still must ensure that stolen documents are not accepted.

Other types of identity theft have become more common in Sweden. One common example is ordering a credit card to someone who has an unlocked letterbox and is not home during the daytime. The thief steals the letter with the credit card and the letter with the code, which typically arrives a few days later. Usage of a stolen credit card is difficult in Sweden since an identity document or a PIN code is normally demanded. If a shop does not demand either, it must take the loss from accepting a stolen credit card. The practice of observing someone using their credit card&#x27;s PIN code, stealing the credit card, or skimming it, and then using the credit card has become more common.

Legally, Sweden is an open society. The Principle of Public Access states that all information (e.g. addresses, incomes, taxes) kept by public authorities must be available for anyone, except in certain cases (for example, the addresses of people who need to hide are restricted). This makes fraud easier.

Until 2016, there were no laws that specifically prohibited using someone&#x27;s identity. Instead, there were only laws regarding any indirect damages caused. Impersonating anyone else for financial gain is a type of fraud in the Criminal Code (). Impersonating anyone else to discredit them by hacking into their social media accounts and provoke is considered libel. However, it is difficult to convict someone of committing this crime. In late 2016, a new law was introduced which partially banned undetermined identity usage.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, personal data is protected by the Data Protection Act 1998. The Act covers all personal data which an organization may hold, including names, birthday and anniversary dates, addresses, and telephone numbers.

Under English law (which extends to Wales but not to Northern Ireland or Scotland), the deception offences under the Theft Act 1968 increasingly contend with identity theft situations. In &quot;R v Seward&quot; (2005) EWCA Crim 1941, the defendant was acting as the &quot;frontman&quot; in the use of stolen credit cards and other documents to obtain goods. He obtained goods to the value of £10,000 for others who are unlikely ever to be identified. The Court of Appeal considered a sentencing policy for deception offenses involving &quot;identity theft&quot; and concluded that a prison sentence was required. Henriques J. said at para 14: &quot;Identity fraud is a particularly pernicious and prevalent form of dishonesty calling for, in our judgment, deterrent sentences.&quot;

Statistics released by CIFAS (UK&#x27;s Fraud Prevention Service) show that there were 89,000 victims of identity theft in the UK in 2010 and 85,000 victims in 2009. Men in their 30s and 40s are the most common victims. Identity fraud now accounts for nearly half of all frauds recorded.

=== United States ===

The increase in crimes of identity theft led to the drafting of the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act. In 1998, The Federal Trade Commission appeared before the United States Senate. The FTC discussed crimes which exploit consumer credit to commit loan fraud, mortgage fraud, lines-of-credit fraud, credit card fraud, commodities and services frauds. The Identity Theft Deterrence Act (2003)[ITADA] amended U.S. Code Title 18, § 1028 (&quot;Fraud related to activity in connection with identification documents, authentication features, and information&quot;). The statute now makes the possession of any &quot;means of identification&quot; to &quot;knowingly transfer, possess, or use without lawful authority&quot; a federal crime, alongside unlawful possession of identification documents. However, for federal jurisdiction to prosecute, the crime must include an &quot;identification document&quot; that either: (a) is purportedly issued by the United States, (b) is used or intended to defraud the United States, (c) is sent through the mail, or (d) is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce. &quot;See&quot; (c). Punishment can be up to 5, 15, 20, or 30 years in federal prison, plus fines, depending on the underlying crime per (b). In addition, punishments for the unlawful use of a &quot;means of identification&quot; were strengthened in § 1028A (&quot;Aggravated Identity Theft&quot;), allowing for a consecutive sentence under specific enumerated felony violations as defined in § 1028A(c)(1) through (11).

The Act also provides the Federal Trade Commission with authority to track the number of incidents and the dollar value of losses. Their figures relate mainly to consumer financial crimes and not the broader range of all identification-based crimes.

If charges are brought by state or local law enforcement agencies, different penalties apply to depend on the state.

Six Federal agencies conducted a joint task force to increase the ability to detect identity theft. Their joint recommendation on &quot;red flag&quot; guidelines is a set of requirements on financial institutions and other entities which furnish credit data to credit reporting services to develop written plans for detecting identity theft. The FTC has determined that most medical practices are considered creditors and are subject to requirements to develop a plan to prevent and respond to patient identity theft. These plans must be adopted by each organization&#x27;s board of directors and monitored by senior executives.

Identity theft complaints as a percentage of all fraud complaints decreased from 2004 to 2006. The Federal Trade Commission reported that fraud complaints in general were growing faster than ID theft complaints. The findings were similar in two other FTC studies done in 2003 and 2005. In 2003, 4.6 percent of the US population said they were a victim of ID theft. In 2005, that number had dropped to 3.7 percent of the population. The commission&#x27;s 2003 estimate was that identity theft accounted for some $52.6 billion of losses in the preceding year alone and affected more than 9.91 million Americans; the figure comprises $47.6 billion lost by businesses and $5 billion lost by consumers.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2010, 7% of US households experienced identity theft - up from 5.5% in 2005 when the figures were first assembled, but broadly flat since 2007. In 2012, approximately 16.6 million persons, or 7% of all U.S. residents age 16 or older, reported being victims of one or more incidents of identity theft.

At least two states, California and Wisconsin have created an Office of Privacy Protection to assist their citizens in avoiding and recovering from identity theft.

In 2009, Indiana created an Identity Theft Unit within their Office of Attorney General to educate and assist consumers in avoiding and recovering from identity theft as well as assist law enforcement in investigating and prosecuting identity theft crimes.

In Massachusetts in 2009–2010, Governor Deval Patrick committed to balancing consumer protection with the needs of small business owners. His Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation announced certain adjustments to Massachusetts&#x27; identity theft regulations that maintain protections and also allow flexibility in compliance. These updated regulations went into effect on 1 March 2010. The regulations are clear that their approach to data security is a risk-based approach important to small businesses and might not handle a lot of personal information about customers.

The IRS has created the IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit to help taxpayers&#x27; who are victims of federal tax-related identity theft. Generally, the identity thief will use a stolen SSN to file a forged tax return and attempt to get a fraudulent refund early in the filing season. A taxpayer will need to fill out Form 14039, &quot;Identity Theft Affidavit&quot;.

As for the future of medical care and Medicaid, people are mostly concerned about cloud computing. The addition of using cloud information within the United States medicare system would institute easily accessible health information for individuals, but that also makes it easier for identity theft. Currently, new technology is being produced to help encrypt and protect files, which will create a smooth transition to cloud technology in the healthcare system.

==== Notification ====
Many states followed California&#x27;s lead and enacted mandatory data breach notification laws. As a result, companies that report a data breach typically report it to all their customers.

== Spread and impact ==

Surveys in the US from 2003 to 2006 showed a decrease in the total number of identity fraud victims and a decrease in the total value of identity fraud from US$47.6 billion in 2003 to $15.6 billion in 2006. The average fraud per person decreased from $4,789 in 2003 to $1,882 in 2006. A Microsoft report shows that this drop is due to statistical problems with the methodology, that such survey-based estimates are &quot;hopelessly flawed&quot; and exaggerate the true losses by orders of magnitude.

The 2003 survey from the Identity Theft Resource Center found that:
* Only 15% of victims find out about the theft through proactive action taken by a business
* The average time spent by victims resolving the problem is about 330 hours
* 73% of respondents indicated the crime involved the thief acquiring a credit card
In a widely publicized account, Michelle Brown, a victim of identity fraud, testified before a U.S. Senate Committee Hearing on Identity Theft. Ms. Brown testified that: &quot;over a year and a half from January 1998 through July 1999, one individual impersonated me to procure over $50,000 in goods and services. Not only did she damage my credit, but she escalated her crimes to a level that I never truly expected: she engaged in drug trafficking. The crime resulted in my erroneous arrest record, a warrant out for my arrest, and eventually, a prison record when she was booked under my name as an inmate in the Chicago Federal Prison.&quot;

In Australia, identity theft was estimated to be worth between A$1billion and A$4 billion per annum in 2001.

In the United Kingdom, the Home Office reported that identity fraud costs the UK economy £1.2 billion annually (experts believe that the real figure could be much higher) although privacy groups object to the validity of these numbers, arguing that they are being used by the government to push for introduction of national ID cards. Confusion over exactly what constitutes identity theft has led to claims that statistics may be exaggerated.
An extensively reported study from Microsoft Research in 2011 finds that estimates of identity theft losses contain enormous exaggerations, writing that surveys &quot;are so compromised and biased that no faith whatever can be placed in their findings.&quot;

<doc id="180613" wikidata="Q1608240" url="?curid=180613" title="H. E. Bates">
<text>Herbert Ernest Bates (16 May 1905 – 29 January 1974) was a British writer, known for his gritty realistic short stories (he wrote more than 25 collections) and novels set in the early to mid 20th century of England mainly. He was from the countryside and adored flowers and gardening (writing two books on gardening), so much of his writing is informed by this. The semi-autobiographical &quot;Love for Lydia&quot; has detailed descriptions of nature in winter, and of the big grounds of Aspen Hall where he meets Lydia. His best-known works include &quot;Love for Lydia&quot;, &quot;Fair Stood the Wind for France&quot;, &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;, as well as &quot;My Uncle Silas&quot;. Many of his short stories were turned into tv series by British television in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Herbert Ernest Bates was born on 16 May 1905 in Rushden, Northamptonshire, and educated at Kettering Grammar School. After the end of school, he worked as a reporter and a warehouse clerk.

==Career==
Typically, Bates&#x27; best-known works are set in the English countryside, particularly the Midlands including his native Northamptonshire and the &#x27;Garden of England&#x27;, Kent, the setting for &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;. Bates was partial to taking long walks around the Northamptonshire countryside, which often provided the inspiration for his stories. His love for the countryside is exemplified in two volumes of essays, &quot;Through the Woods&quot; and &quot;Down the River&quot;. Both have been reprinted numerous times. Several of Bates&#x27;s works, such &quot;The Bride Comes to Evensford&quot; and &quot;Love for Lydia&quot;, are set in the fictional town of Evensford, which is based on Bates&#x27;s hometown Rushden in Northamptonshire.

Bates discarded his first novel, written when he was in his late teenage years, but his second, and the first to be published, &quot;The Two Sisters&quot;, was inspired by one of his midnight walks, which took him to the small village of Farndish. There, late at night, he saw a light burning in a cottage window and it was this that triggered the story. He was working briefly for the local newspaper in Wellingborough, a job which he hated, and then later at a local shoe-making warehouse, where he had time to write; in fact the whole of this first novel was written there. This was sent to, and rejected by, eight or nine publishers until Jonathan Cape accepted it on the advice of its respected Reader, Edward Garnett. Bates was then twenty years old. More novels, collections of short stories, essays, and articles followed, but did not pay well.

===World War II short stories===
During World War II, he was commissioned into the Royal Air Force solely to write short stories. The Air Ministry realised that it might create more favorable public sentiment by emphasizing stories about the people fighting the war, rather than facts. The stories were published originally in the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; with the pseudonym &quot;Flying Officer X&quot;. Later they were published in book form as &quot;The Greatest People in the World and Other Stories&quot; and &quot;How Sleep the Brave and Other Stories&quot;. His first financial success was &quot;Fair Stood the Wind for France&quot;. After a posting to the Far East, this was followed by two novels about Burma, &quot;The Purple Plain&quot; in 1947 and &quot;The Jacaranda Tree&quot; (published in 1949), and one set in India, &quot;The Scarlet Sword&quot; (published in 1950).

He was also commissioned by the Air Ministry to write &quot;The Battle of the Flying Bomb&quot;, but because of various disagreements within the government, it was cancelled, and then publication was banned for 30 years. It was discovered by Bob Ogley and published during 1994 with the title &quot;Flying Bombs over England&quot;. Another commission which has still to be published is &quot;Night Interception Battle&quot; concerning the difficulty of tracking enemy aircraft at night.

===Post-war work===
Other novels followed after the war; he averaged about one novel and a collection of short stories a year, which was considered very productive at the time. These included &quot;The Feast of July&quot; and &quot;Love for Lydia&quot;. His most popular creation was the Larkin family in &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;. Pop Larkin and his family were inspired by a person seen in a local shop in Kent by Bates and his family when on holiday. The man (probably Wiltshire trader William Dell, also on holiday) had a huge wad of rubber-banded bank notes and proceeded to treat his trailer load of children with Easter eggs and ice creams. Other characters were modelled on friends and acquaintances of Bates, such as Iris Snow (a parody of Iris Murdoch) and the Brigadier who was modelled on the father of John Bayley, Murdoch&#x27;s husband.

The television adaptation, produced after his death by his son Richard and based on these stories, was a tremendous success. It is also the source of the American movie &quot;The Mating Game&quot;. The &quot;My Uncle Silas&quot; stories were also made into a UK television series from 2000 to 2003. Many other stories were adapted to TV and others to movies, the most renowned being &quot;The Purple Plain&quot; in 1954 and &quot;The Triple Echo&quot;; Bates also worked on other movie scripts. In 2020 ITV commissioned a new television series of The Darling Buds of May, with the title The Larkins starring Bradley Walsh, Joanna Scanlan, Sabrina Bartlett and Tok Stephen. The first episode aired in October 2021.

==Personal life==
In 1931, he married Madge Cox, who lived two streets away from him in his native Rushden. They moved to the village of Little Chart in Kent and bought an old granary and this together with an acre of garden they converted into a home. Bates was a keen and knowledgeable gardener who wrote many books on flowers. The Granary remained their home for the whole of their married life.

They had two sons and two daughters: Ann, Judith, Richard and Jonathan. Jonathan Bates was nominated for an Academy Award for his sound work on the 1982 movie &quot;Gandhi&quot;. Richard became a television producer, Bates&#x27;s granddaughter, Victoria Wicks is an actress and script consultant.

==Death and honours==
Bates died on 29 January 1974 in Canterbury, Kent, aged 68. A prolific and successful author, his greatest success was posthumous, with the television adaptations of his stories &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; and its sequels as well as adaptations of &quot;My Uncle Silas&quot;, &quot;A Moment in Time&quot;, &quot;Fair Stood the Wind for France&quot; and &quot;Love for Lydia&quot;. In his home town of Rushden, H.E. Bates has a road named after him to the west of the town, leading to the local leisure centre. His archive is held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. After Bates&#x27; death Madge moved to a bungalow, which had originally been a cow byre, next to the Granary. She died in 2004 at the age of 95.

<doc id="180618" wikidata="Q209641" url="?curid=180618" title="John le Carré">
<text>David John Moore Cornwell (19 October 193112 December 2020), better known by his pen name John le Carré ( ), was a British author, best known for his espionage novels, many of which were successfully adapted for film or television. A &quot;sophisticated, morally ambiguous writer&quot;, he is considered one of the greatest novelists of the postwar era. During the 1950s and 1960s, he worked for both the Security Service (MI5) and the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Near the end of his life, le Carré became an Irish citizen.

Le Carré&#x27;s third novel, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963), became an international best-seller, was adapted as an award-winning film, and remains one of his best-known works. This success allowed him to leave MI6 to become a full-time author. His other novels that have been adapted for film or television include &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot; (1965), &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1974), &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (1979), &quot;The Little Drummer Girl&quot; (1983), &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1989), &quot;The Night Manager&quot; (1993), &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; (1996), &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; (2001), &quot;A Most Wanted Man&quot; (2008) and &quot;Our Kind of Traitor&quot; (2010). Philip Roth said that &quot;A Perfect Spy&quot; (1986) was &quot;the best English novel since the war&quot;.

==Early life and education==
David John Moore Cornwell was born on 19 October 1931 in Poole, Dorset, England, son of Ronald Thomas Archibald (Ronnie) Cornwell (1905–1975), and Olive Moore Cornwell (née Glassey, 1906–1989). His older brother, Tony (1929–2017), was an advertising executive and county cricketer (for Dorset), who later lived in the United States. His younger half-sister was the actress Charlotte Cornwell (1949–2021), and his younger half-brother, Rupert Cornwell (1946–2017), was a former Washington bureau chief for &quot;The Independent&quot;. Cornwell had little early memory of his mother, who had left their family home when he was five years old. His maternal uncle was Liberal MP Alec Glassey. When Cornwell was 21 years old, Glassey gave him the address in Ipswich where his mother was living; mother and son reunited at Ipswich railway station, at her written invitation, following Cornwell&#x27;s initial letter of reconciliation.

Cornwell&#x27;s father — who escaped from his &quot;orthodox but repressive upbringing&quot; as son of &quot;a respectable nonconformist bricklayer who became a house builder and mayor of Poole&quot; — had been jailed for insurance fraud and was a known associate of the Kray twins. The family was continually in debt. The father–son relationship has been described as &quot;difficult&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Le Carré recalled that he had been &quot;beaten up by his father and grew up mostly starved of affection after his mother abandoned him at the age of five&quot;. Rick Pym, a scheming con man and the father of &quot;A Perfect Spy&quot; protagonist Magnus Pym, was based on Ronnie. When his father died in 1975, Cornwell paid for a memorial funeral service but did not attend, a plot point repeated in &quot;A Perfect Spy&quot;.

Cornwell&#x27;s schooling began at St Andrew&#x27;s Preparatory School, near Pangbourne, Berkshire, and continued at Sherborne School. He grew unhappy with the typically harsh English public school regime of the time and disliked his disciplinarian housemaster. He left Sherborne early to study foreign languages at the University of Bern from 1948 to 1949. In 1950, he was called up for National Service and served in the Intelligence Corps of the British Army garrisoned in Allied-occupied Austria, working as a German language interrogator of people who had crossed the Iron Curtain to the West. In 1952, he returned to England to study at Lincoln College, Oxford, where he worked covertly for the Security Service, MI5, spying on far-left groups for information about possible Soviet agents. During his studies, he was a member of The Gridiron Club and a college dining society known as The Goblin Club.

When his father was declared bankrupt in 1954, Cornwell left Oxford to teach at Millfield Preparatory School; however, a year later, he returned to Oxford, and graduated in 1956 with a First-Class degree in Modern Languages with a German Literature concentration. He then taught French and German at Eton College for two years, before becoming an MI5 officer in 1958.

==Work in security services==
He ran agents, conducted interrogations, tapped telephone lines and effected break-ins. Encouraged by Lord Clanmorris (who wrote crime novels as &quot;John Bingham&quot;), and while being an active MI5 officer, Cornwell began writing his first novel, &quot;Call for the Dead&quot; (1961). Cornwell identified Lord Clanmorris as one of two models for George Smiley, the spymaster of the Circus, the other being Vivian H. H. Green. As a schoolboy, Cornwell first met the latter when Green was the Chaplain and Assistant Master at Sherborne School (1942–51). The friendship continued after Green&#x27;s move to Lincoln College, where he tutored Cornwell.

In 1960, Cornwell transferred to MI6, the foreign-intelligence service, and worked under the cover of Second Secretary at the British Embassy in Bonn. He was later transferred to Hamburg as a political consul. There, he wrote the detective story &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963), as &quot;John le Carré&quot;—a pseudonym required because Foreign Office staff were forbidden to publish under their own names. The meaning of the pseudonym is ambiguous: he sometimes said he had seen &quot;le Carré&quot; on a storefront, and later said he couldn&#x27;t remember an origin. When translated, &quot;le carré&quot; means &quot;the square&quot;.

In 1964, le Carré&#x27;s career as an intelligence officer came to an end as the result of the betrayal of British agents&#x27; covers to the KGB by Kim Philby, the infamous British double agent, one of the Cambridge Five. Le Carré depicted and analysed Philby as the upper-class traitor, codenamed &quot;Gerald&quot; by the KGB, the mole hunted by George Smiley in &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot; (1974).

==Writing==
Le Carré&#x27;s first two novels, &quot;Call for the Dead&quot; (1961) and &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot; (1962), are mystery fiction. Each features a retired spy, George Smiley, investigating a death; in the first book, the apparent suicide of a suspected communist, and in the second volume, a murder at a boys&#x27; public school. Although &quot;Call for the Dead&quot; evolves into an espionage story, Smiley&#x27;s motives are more personal than political. Le Carré&#x27;s third novel, &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1963), became an international best-seller and remains one of his best-known works; following its publication, he left MI6 to become a full-time writer. Although le Carré had intended &quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; as an indictment of espionage as morally compromised, audiences widely viewed its protagonist, Alec Leamas, as a tragic hero. In response, le Carré&#x27;s next book, &quot;The Looking Glass War&quot;, was a satire about an increasingly deadly espionage mission which ultimately proves pointless.

&quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; and &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; (the Karla trilogy) brought Smiley back as the central figure in a sprawling espionage saga depicting his efforts first to root out a mole in the Circus and then to entrap his Soviet rival and counterpart, code-named &#x27;Karla&#x27;. The trilogy was originally meant to be a long-running series that would find Smiley dispatching agents after Karla all around the world. &quot;Smiley&#x27;s People&quot; marked the last time Smiley featured as the central character in a le Carré story, although he brought the character back in &quot;The Secret Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;A Legacy of Spies&quot;.

&quot;A Perfect Spy&quot; (1986), which chronicles the boyhood moral education of Magnus Pym and how it leads to his becoming a spy, is the author&#x27;s most autobiographical espionage novel, reflecting the boy&#x27;s very close relationship with his con man father. Biographer LynnDianne Beene describes the novelist&#x27;s own father, Ronnie Cornwell, as &quot;an epic con man of little education, immense charm, extravagant tastes, but no social values&quot;. Le Carré reflected that &quot;writing &quot;A Perfect Spy&quot; is probably what a very wise shrink would have advised&quot;. He also wrote a semi-autobiographical work, &quot;The Naïve and Sentimental Lover&quot; (1971), as the story of a man&#x27;s midlife existential crisis.

With the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989, le Carré&#x27;s writing shifted to the portrayal of the new multilateral world. His first completely post-Cold War novel, &quot;The Night Manager&quot; (1993), deals with drug and arms smuggling in the world of Latin American drug lords, secretive Caribbean banking entities and corrupt Western officials.

His final novel, &quot;Silverview&quot;, was published posthumously in 2021.

===Themes===
Most of le Carré&#x27;s books are spy stories set during the Cold War (1945–91) and portray British Intelligence agents as unheroic political functionaries, aware of the moral ambiguity of their work and engaged more in psychological than physical drama. While &quot;[espionage] was the genre that earned him fame...he used it as a platform to explore larger ethical problems and the human condition&quot;. The insight he demonstrated led &quot;many fellow authors and critics [to regard] him as one of the finest English-language novelists of the twentieth century.&quot; His writing explores &quot;human frailty—moral ambiguity, intrigue, nuance, doubt, and cowardice&quot;.

The fallibility of Western democracy – and of its secret services – is a recurring theme, as are suggestions of a possible east–west moral equivalence. Characters experience little of the violence typically encountered in action thrillers and have very little recourse to gadgets. Much of the conflict is internal, rather than external and visible. The recurring character George Smiley, who plays a central role in five novels and appears as a supporting character in four more, was written as an &quot;antidote&quot; to James Bond, a character le Carré called &quot;an international gangster&quot; rather than a spy and who he felt should be excluded from the canon of espionage literature. In contrast, he intended Smiley, who is an overweight, bespectacled bureaucrat who uses cunning and manipulation to achieve his ends, as an accurate depiction of a spy.

Le Carré&#x27;s &quot;writing entered intelligence services themselves. He popularized the term &#x27;mole&#x27;...and other language that has become intelligence vernacular on both sides of the Atlantic — &#x27;honeytrap&#x27;, &#x27;scalphunter&#x27;, &#x27;lamplighter&#x27; to name a few.&quot; However, in his first tweet as MI6&#x27;s chief, Richard Moore revealed the agency&#x27;s &quot;complicated relationship with the author: He urged would-be Smileys not to apply to the service.&quot;

===Other writing, film cameos===
Le Carré records a number of incidents from his period as a diplomat in his autobiographical work, &quot;The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life&quot; (2016), which include escorting six visiting German parliamentarians to a London brothel and translating at a meeting between a senior German politician and Harold Macmillan.

As a journalist, le Carré wrote &quot;The Unbearable Peace&quot; (1991), a nonfiction account of Brigadier Jean-Louis Jeanmaire (1911–1992), the Swiss Army officer, who spied for the Soviet Union from 1962 until 1975.

Credited under his pen name, le Carré appears as an extra in the 2011 film version of &quot;Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy&quot;, among the guests at the Christmas party in several flashback scenes.
He also appears, in uncredited cameo roles, as a museum usher in the 2016 movie, &quot;Our Kind of Traitor&quot;, and in the 2016 BBC TV production, &quot;The Night Manager&quot;, as a restaurant diner.

==Politics==
===Threats to democracy===
In 2017, le Carré expressed concerns over the future of liberal democracy, saying: &quot;I think of all things that were happening across Europe in the 1930s, in Spain, in Japan, obviously in Germany. To me, these are absolutely comparable signs of the rise of fascism and it&#x27;s contagious, it&#x27;s infectious. Fascism is up and running in Poland and Hungary. There&#x27;s an encouragement about&quot;. He later wrote that the end of the Cold War had left the West without a coherent ideology, in contrast to the &quot;notion of individual freedom, of inclusiveness, of tolerance – all of that we called anti-communism&quot; prevailing during that time.

Le Carré opposed both U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, arguing that their desire to seek or maintain their countries&#x27; superpower status caused an impulse &quot;for oligarchy, the dismissal of the truth, the contempt, actually, for the electorate and for the democratic system&quot;. Le Carré compared Trump&#x27;s tendency to dismiss the media as &quot;fake news&quot; to the Nazi book burnings, and wrote that the United States is &quot;heading straight down the road to institutional racism and neo-fascism&quot;.

In le Carré&#x27;s 2019 novel &quot;Agent Running in the Field&quot;, one of the novel&#x27;s characters refers to Trump as &quot;Putin&#x27;s shithouse cleaner&quot; who &quot;does everything for little Vladi that little Vladi can&#x27;t do for himself&quot;. The novel&#x27;s narrator describes Boris Johnson as &quot;a pig-ignorant foreign secretary&quot;. He says Russia is moving &quot;backwards into her dark, delusional past&quot;, with Britain following a short way behind. Le Carré later said that he believed the novel&#x27;s plotline, involving the U.S. and British intelligence services colluding to subvert the European Union, to be &quot;horribly possible&quot;.

===Brexit===
Le Carré was an outspoken advocate of European integration and sharply criticised Brexit. Le Carré criticised Brexit advocates such as Boris Johnson (whom he referred to as a &quot;mob orator&quot;), Dominic Cummings and Nigel Farage in interviews, claiming that their &quot;task is to fire up the people with nostalgia [and] with anger&quot;. He further opined in interviews: &quot;What really scares me about nostalgia is that it&#x27;s become a political weapon. Politicians are creating a nostalgia for an England that never existed, and selling it, really, as something we could return to&quot;, adding that, with &quot;the demise of the working class we saw also the demise of an established social order, based on the stability of ancient class structures&quot;. On the other hand, he said that in the Labour Party &quot;they have this Leninist element and they have this huge appetite to level society.&quot;

On Brexit, le Carré did not mince his words, comparing it to the 1956 Suez crisis, which confirmed post-imperial Britain&#x27;s loss of global power. &quot;This is without doubt the greatest catastrophe and the greatest idiocy that Britain has perpetrated since the invasion of Suez&quot;, le Carré said of Brexit. &quot;Nobody is to blame but the Brits themselves – not the Irish, not the Europeans.&quot; &quot;The idea, to me, that at the moment we should imagine we can substitute access to the biggest trade union in the world with access to the American market is terrifying&quot;, he said.

Speaking to &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2019, he commented: &quot;I&#x27;ve always believed, though ironically it&#x27;s not the way I&#x27;ve voted, that it&#x27;s compassionate conservatism that in the end could, for example, integrate the private schooling system. If you do it from the left you will seem to be acting out of resentment; do it from the right and it looks like good social organisation.&quot; Le Carré also said: &quot;I think my own ties to England were hugely loosened over the last few years. And it&#x27;s a kind of liberation, if a sad kind.&quot;

===US invasion of Iraq===
In January 2003, two months prior to the invasion, &quot;The Times&quot; published le Carré&#x27;s essay &quot;The United States Has Gone Mad&quot; criticising the buildup to the Iraq War and President George W. Bush&#x27;s response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, calling it &quot;worse than McCarthyism, worse than the Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the Vietnam War&quot; and &quot;beyond anything Osama bin Laden could have hoped for in his nastiest dreams&quot;. Le Carré participated in the London protests against the Iraq War. He said the war resulted from the &quot;politicisation of intelligence to fit the political intentions&quot; of governments and &quot;How Bush and his junta succeeded in deflecting America&#x27;s anger from bin Laden to Saddam Hussein is one of the great public relations conjuring tricks of history&quot;.

He was critical of Tony Blair&#x27;s role in taking Britain into the Iraq War, saying: &quot;I can&#x27;t understand that Blair has an afterlife at all. It seems to me that any politician who takes his country to war under false pretences has committed the ultimate sin. I think that a war in which we refuse to accept the body count of those that we kill is also a war of which we should be ashamed.&quot;

===Iran===
Le Carré was critical of Western governments&#x27; policies towards Iran. He said that Iran&#x27;s actions are a response to being &quot;encircled by nuclear powers&quot; and by the way in which &quot;we ousted Mosaddeq through the CIA and the Secret Service here across the way and installed the Shah and trained his ghastly secret police force in all the black arts, the SAVAK&quot;.

Le Carré feuded with Salman Rushdie over &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, stating: &quot;Nobody has a God-given right to insult a great religion and be published with impunity&quot;.

===Israel===
In a 1998 interview with Douglas Davis, Le Carré described Israel as &quot;the most extraordinary carnival of human variety that I have ever set eyes on, a nation in the process of re-assembling itself from the shards of its past, now Oriental, now Western, now secular, now religious, but always anxiously moralizing about itself, criticizing itself with Maoist ferocity, a nation crackling with debate, rediscovering its past while it fought for its future.&quot; He declared: &quot;No nation on earth was more deserving of peace—or more condemned to fight for it.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1954, Cornwell married Alison Ann Veronica Sharp. They had three sons: Simon, Stephen and Timothy; they divorced in 1971. In 1972, Cornwell married Valerie Jane Eustace, a book editor with Hodder &amp; Stoughton who collaborated with him behind the scenes. They had a son, Nicholas, who writes as Nick Harkaway. Le Carré lived in St Buryan, Cornwall, for more than 40 years; he owned a mile of cliff near Land&#x27;s End. The house, Tregiffian Cottage, was put up for sale in 2023 for £3 million. Le Carré also owned a house in Gainsborough Gardens in Hampstead in north London.

Le Carré was so disillusioned by the 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union that he secured Irish citizenship. In a BBC documentary broadcast in 2021, le Carré&#x27;s son Nicholas revealed that his father&#x27;s disillusionment with modern Britain, and Brexit in particular, had driven him to embrace his Irish heritage and become an Irish citizen. At the time of his death, le Carré&#x27;s friend, the novelist John Banville, confirmed that the writer had researched his family roots in Inchinattin, near Rosscarbery, County Cork, and that he had applied for an Irish passport, to which he was entitled having completed the process of becoming an Irish citizen and having Irish ancestry through his maternal grandmother, Olive Wolfe. His neighbour and friend Philippe Sands recalled: 
Le Carré died at Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro, on 12 December 2020, aged 89. An inquest completed in June 2021 concluded that le Carré died after sustaining a fall at his home. His wife Valerie died on 27 February 2021, two months after her husband, at age 82.

In 2023, biographer Adam Sisman in &quot;The Secret Life of John le Carré&quot; identified 11 women with whom le Carré had affairs during his second marriage.

Le Carré&#x27;s son Timothy died on 31 May 2022 at the age of 59, shortly after he finished editing &quot;A Private Spy&quot;, a collection of his father&#x27;s letters.

<doc id="180624" wikidata="Q934680" url="?curid=180624" title="Vehicle dynamics">
<text>Vehicle dynamics is the study of vehicle motion, e.g., how a vehicle&#x27;s forward movement changes in response to driver inputs, propulsion system outputs, ambient conditions, air/surface/water conditions, etc.
Vehicle dynamics is a part of engineering primarily based on classical mechanics.
It may be applied for motorized vehicles (such as automobiles), bicycles and motorcycles, aircraft, and watercraft.

== Factors affecting vehicle dynamics ==
The aspects of a vehicle&#x27;s design which affect the dynamics can be grouped into drivetrain and braking, suspension and steering, distribution of mass, aerodynamics and tires.

=== Drivetrain and braking ===
* Automobile layout (i.e. location of engine and driven wheels)
* Powertrain
* Braking system

=== Suspension and steering===
Some attributes relate to the geometry of the suspension, steering and chassis. These include:
* Ackermann steering geometry
* Axle track
* Camber angle
* Caster angle
* Ride height
* Roll center
* Scrub radius
* Steering ratio
* Toe
* Wheel alignment
* Wheelbase

=== Distribution of mass ===
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics are purely due to mass and its distribution. These include:
* Center of mass
* Moment of inertia
* Roll moment
* Sprung mass
* Unsprung mass
* Weight distribution

=== Aerodynamics ===
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics are purely aerodynamic. These include:
* Automobile drag coefficient
* Automotive aerodynamics
* Center of pressure
* Downforce
* Ground effect in cars

=== Tires ===
Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics can be attributed directly to the tires. These include:
* Camber thrust
* Circle of forces
* Contact patch
* Cornering force
* Ground pressure
* Pacejka&#x27;s Magic Formula
* Pneumatic trail
* Radial Force Variation
* Relaxation length
* Rolling resistance
* Self aligning torque
* Skid
* Slip angle
* Slip (vehicle dynamics)
* Spinout
* Steering ratio
* Tire load sensitivity

== Vehicle behaviours ==

Some attributes or aspects of vehicle dynamics are purely dynamic. These include:
* Body flex
* Body roll
* Bump Steer
* Bundorf analysis
* Directional stability
* Critical speed
* Noise, vibration, and harshness
* Pitch
* Ride quality
* Roll
* Speed wobble
* Understeer, oversteer, lift-off oversteer, and fishtailing
* Weight transfer and load transfer
* Yaw

==Analysis and simulation==
The dynamic behavior of vehicles can be analysed in several different ways. This can be as straightforward as a simple spring mass system, through a three-degree of freedom (DoF) bicycle model, to a large degree of complexity using a multibody system simulation package such as MSC ADAMS or Modelica. As computers have gotten faster, and software user interfaces have improved, commercial packages such as CarSim have become widely used in industry for rapidly evaluating hundreds of test conditions much faster than real time. Vehicle models are often simulated with advanced controller designs provided as software in the loop (SIL) with controller design software such as Simulink, or with physical hardware in the loop (HIL).

Vehicle motions are largely due to the shear forces generated between the tires and road, and therefore the tire model is an essential part of the math model. In current vehicle simulator models, the tire model is the weakest and most difficult part to simulate. The tire model must produce realistic shear forces during braking, acceleration, cornering, and combinations, on a range of surface conditions. Many models are in use. Most are semi-empirical, such as the Pacejka Magic Formula model.

Racing car games or simulators are also a form of vehicle dynamics simulation. In early versions many simplifications were necessary in order to get real-time performance with reasonable graphics. However, improvements in computer speed have combined with interest in realistic physics, leading to driving simulators that are used for vehicle engineering using detailed models such as CarSim.

It is important that the models should agree with real world test results, hence many of the following tests are correlated against results from instrumented test vehicles.

Techniques include:
* Linear range constant radius understeer
* Fishhook
* Frequency response
* Lane change
* Moose test
* Sinusoidal steering
* Skidpad
* Swept path analysis

<text>The New York Liberty are an American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The Liberty compete in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) as a member of the Eastern Conference. The team was founded in 1997 and is one of the eight original franchises of the league. The team is owned by Joe Tsai and Clara Wu Tsai, the majority owners of the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets. The team plays its home games at Barclays Center.

The Liberty have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in nineteen of its twenty-eight years. The franchise has been home to many well-known players such as Teresa Weatherspoon, Rebecca Lobo, Becky Hammon, Leilani Mitchell, Essence Carson, Cappie Pondexter, Tina Charles, the team&#x27;s first-ever No.1 overall draft pick Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, Jonquel Jones, and Courtney Vandersloot.

The Liberty have three conference championships, and one WNBA championship. They have played in the WNBA Finals six times— defeating the Minnesota Lynx in 2024, and losing to the Houston Comets in 1997, 1999, and 2000, the Los Angeles Sparks in 2002 and the Las Vegas Aces in 2023.

The New York Liberty introduced their mascot, Ellie the Elephant, on May 6, 2021.

==History==
===Early success (1997–2002)===
Prior to the team&#x27;s first season, to avoid potential trademark infringement, the team purchased the trademarks of the defunct Liberty Basketball Association.

When the WNBA opened in 1997, the Liberty were one of the first teams to choose a player, and they signed college superstar Rebecca Lobo (UConn) to a contract. Lobo was a starter for two seasons, but was injured in 1999. Her injuries eventually led to her retirement several seasons later. Point guard Teresa Weatherspoon emerged as a star, and the Liberty made it to the 1997 championship game, where the team lost to the Houston Comets. In 1999, they added Crystal Robinson with the 6th overall pick and returned to the WNBA Finals, where they again faced the Comets. In Game 2, Teresa Weatherspoon&#x27;s halfcourt shot at the buzzer gave the Liberty a one-point road win that tied the series at a game apiece. However, the Liberty lost the third game of the series and the Comets became champions for a third straight time.

In 2000, the Liberty traded for Tari Phillips who blossomed in New York and made four straight All-Star teams. In 2001, Weatherspoon became the WNBA&#x27;s all-time assist leader. Teamed with Robinson, Phillips and an emerging Sue Wicks, who was once a back-up to Lobo at forward but made the 2000 All-Star game, Weatherspoon and the Liberty subsequently returned to the finals in 2000 and 2002, but lost once again to the Comets and to the Los Angeles Sparks, respectively. The Liberty also advanced to the WNBA Eastern Conference Finals in 2001.

===Transition seasons (2003–2009)===

The 2003 season marked a transition for the Liberty and with team leader Teresa Weatherspoon&#x27;s WNBA career winding down, fan favorite Becky Hammon emerged as a star player. The 2004 season saw Hammon replacing Weatherspoon as the team&#x27;s starting point guard.

The Liberty played six of their home games during the 2004 season at Radio City Music Hall as Madison Square Garden was hosting the 2004 Republican National Convention. These games marked the first time Radio City had hosted a professional sporting event since the Roy Jones Jr. boxing match held in 1999.

With team leader Tari Phillips being signed away to the Houston Comets, Ann Wauters emerged as a force at the team&#x27;s starting center position in 2005. However, she was injured midway through the season. The loss of Wauters was felt as the team was swept two games to none by the Indiana Fever in the first round of the playoffs.

The Liberty had a poor 2006 season, winning only 11 games.

At the beginning of the 2007 WNBA season, the team traded Becky Hammon to the San Antonio Silver Stars for Jessica Davenport, a first round pick in the 2007 WNBA draft. They also acquired center Janel McCarville through the dispersal draft associated with the dissolution of the Charlotte Sting. The 2007 Liberty started out 5–0, then lost 7 straight games, then rallied at the end of the season to get the last playoff spot by winning 3 out of their last 4 games, beating the Washington Mystics on the tiebreaker of head-to-head record. In the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Liberty, as huge underdogs, faced the defending champion Detroit Shock in a best-of-three series. The Liberty defeated the Shock in game 1 in New York. In games 2 and 3 the Liberty lost both games to the Shock in Detroit, 76–73 and 71–70 (OT), respectively.

In 2008, the Liberty drafted former Rutgers shooting guard Essence Carson and former North Carolina forward Erlana Larkins, and signed former Utah point guard Leilani Mitchell during the preseason. Despite having the youngest average age of any WNBA team, the Liberty managed to win 19 regular season games in 2008, to defeat the Connecticut Sun in the first round of playoff action, and to come within two points of defeating the Detroit Shock in the third and last game of the Eastern Conference Finals. Again, the Detroit series entailed a Liberty victory at home in Game 1, followed by narrow defeats away in Games 2 and 3. The 2008 season also featured the &quot;Liberty Outdoor Classic&quot;, the first ever professional regular season basketball game to be played outdoors, on July 19 at Arthur Ashe Stadium of the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. The Indiana Fever defeated the Liberty in the Outdoor Classic.

In the 2009 WNBA draft, the Liberty selected local favorite Kia Vaughn from Rutgers. With a solid core group, the Liberty looked to be a contender in the East yet again.

In the 2009 season, however, they never proved to be a contender and the team fired head coach Pat Coyle. To replace Coyle, the Liberty hired then-Liberty assistant coach Anne Donovan on an interim basis. Despite the coaching change, the franchise continued to struggle, finishing 13–21, their second worst record in franchise history.

===The Cappie Pondexter era (2010–2014)===
The New York Liberty fared better in 2010, during Donovan&#x27;s first and only full season as head coach. Led by newly signed high scorer Cappie Pondexter (formerly of the Phoenix Mercury) and the 2010 Most Improved Player Award winner Leilani Mitchell, the team made it all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost to the Atlanta Dream.

The team had high hopes for 2011, after the hiring of former WNBA champion head coach John Whisenant. Janel McCarville did not report to training camp, seeking time with her family, and as such, was suspended for the duration of the 2011 season. This caused division and discord within the New York Liberty fanbase. Kia Vaughn was unexpectedly thrust into the role of starting Center.

The Liberty were originally scheduled to be displaced from their usual home court due to renovations at Madison Square Garden scheduled to begin in 2009. However, the renovation plans were delayed, and the Liberty played at the Garden in 2009 and 2010. The Liberty ended up playing in the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, for their 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons while the renovations were ongoing.

Pondexter and Plenette Pierson, along with improved play from Vaughn, allowed New York to be competitive early in the 2011 season. The team went into the All-Star break in third place in the Eastern Conference. In August, Sidney Spencer was traded to the Phoenix Mercury in exchange for Kara Braxton. By maintaining a fairly even standard of play, the Liberty made their way into the WNBA playoffs. However, the Liberty fell to the Indiana Fever in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.

Just before the 2014 WNBA draft, the New York Liberty traded Kelsey Bone, the fourth overall pick in the 2014 WNBA draft (Alyssa Thomas) and the fourth overall pick in the 2015 WNBA draft to the Connecticut Sun for WNBA All-Star Tina Charles, who had requested a trade.

In February 2015, Pondexter was traded to the Chicago Sky for Epiphanny Prince.

===The Isiah Thomas era (2015–2018)===
On May 5, 2015, the Liberty hired Thomas as team president overseeing all business and basketball operations of the franchise. Under Thomas&#x27; leadership as team president and the coaching staff led by Bill Laimbeer as head coach, the Liberty finished first in the Eastern Conference during the 2015 season.

On August 2, 2015, during halftime at the game against the Seattle Storm, the New York Liberty inducted WNBA legend Becky Hammon into the Liberty&#x27;s Ring of Honor. Thomas presented Hammon with her ring during the induction ceremony at Madison Square Garden. Hammon is currently the head coach of the WNBA&#x27;s Las Vegas Aces.

After qualifying for the 2016 WNBA playoffs, the Liberty lost to the Phoenix Mercury in the second round. The Liberty lost to the Washington Mystics in the second round of the 2017 WNBA playoffs.

In November 2017, the Madison Square Garden Company and James L. Dolan announced they were actively looking to sell the franchise. After not immediately finding a buyer, MSG relocated most of the Liberty&#x27;s 2018 home games to Westchester County Center in nearby White Plains, New York, the home of MSG&#x27;s NBA G League team the Westchester Knicks, while still continuing to pursue a sale. In 2018, the Liberty failed to make the playoffs, with a 7–27 record.

=== The Tsai era (2019–present) ===

On January 23, 2019, the Liberty were sold to Joseph Tsai, co-founder of the Alibaba Group, a Chinese internet company, who then owned 49% of the NBA&#x27;s Brooklyn Nets, and Clara Wu Tsai, an American businesswoman and founder of nonprofit organization Reform Alliance. Isiah Thomas was relieved of his duties a month later, on February 21, 2019. During the 2019 season, the Liberty played two games in Brooklyn at the Nets&#x27; home of the Barclays Center, with the rest still in White Plains. Later that year, Joseph Tsai became the sole owner of the Nets and the Barclays Center. For the 2020 season, the Tsais relocated the Liberty to Brooklyn on a full-time basis.

The Liberty were major players in the 2020 WNBA draft, entering that draft with three first-round picks plus two in the early second round. Shortly before the draft, they traded former league MVP Tina Charles to the Washington Mystics in a deal that also involved the Dallas Wings. They chose Sabrina Ionescu as the first pick, with Megan Walker and Jazmine Jones selected later in that round. The team also introduced a new logo, featuring a simplified version of their Statue of Liberty branding. The color black was also made one of the primary colors, echoing the aesthetic of their NBA brother squad, the Brooklyn Nets.

The Liberty began the 2020 season, held in a &quot;bubble&quot; in Bradenton, Florida, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with seven rookies on their opening-night roster. The team suffered a major blow in their third game, in which Ionescu suffered a severe ankle sprain that ultimately ended her season. The Liberty ended the season with a league-worst 2–20 record. Despite the lack of wins, one of the first-year players, 12th overall pick Jazmine Jones, was named to the Associated Press and WNBA&#x27;s All-Rookie teams.

The Liberty made major splashes during the 2021 offseason. Prior to its first season as full-time tenants of Barclays Center, the Liberty added WNBA champions Natasha Howard and Sami Whitcomb in a multi-team trade that sent Kia Nurse and Megan Walker to the Phoenix Mercury and signed Betnijah Laney, the league&#x27;s 2020 Most Improved Player Award winner. The team then added Michaela Onyenwere and DiDi Richards in the 2021 WNBA draft. Laney would represent the Liberty at the 2021 WNBA All-Star Game while Onyenwere won the Associated Press&#x27; Rookie of the Year Award. New York finished the year with a 12–20 record but the 10-game improvement in the win column was enough to push the team into the WNBA playoffs for the first time since 2017. Seeded eighth, the Liberty put up a valiant effort against No. 5 Phoenix in the opening but fell by an 83–82 final.

On December 6, 2021, the Liberty and head coach Walt Hopkins Jr. parted ways. The team would hire former Phoenix head coach Sandy Brondello in his place just over a month later on January 7, 2022. On the roster, the team brought in Stefanie Dolson of the defending champion Chicago Sky and drafted Nyara Sabally fifth overall, though the latter would miss her whole rookie season with an injury. In Brondello&#x27;s first season at the helm, the team was forced to overcome an early injury to Laney and got off to a 1–7 start. But the All-Star efforts of Ionescu and Howard kept the team afloat and they would end the season on a three-game winning streak to secure its second consecutive playoff berth. In the ensuing postseason, the Liberty won the opening game of a best-of-three set with the Chicago Sky but dropped the latter pair. 

In 2023, the Liberty made several major transactions that turned them into immediate contenders: the team acquired 2021 WNBA MVP Jonquel Jones from the Connecticut Sun in a three-team deal that also obtained reserve Kayla Thornton from the Dallas Wings. The Liberty then added the equally accomplished Breanna Stewart and Courtney Vandersloot in free agency. Over the ensuing season, the Liberty won a franchise-record 32 games and defeated the Las Vegas Aces in the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup in-season competition, with Jones securing MVP honors. The Liberty then took down the Washington Mystics and Connecticut Sun in the WNBA playoffs to earn their first WNBA Finals berth since 2002. Las Vegas, however, took revenge and the best-of-five series in four games.

New York retained most of its core from the Finals run, re-signing both Jones and Stewart. Further assisted by the emergence of WNBA rookie Leonie Fiebich, the Liberty once again won 32 games, tying the franchise record set the year before. The Liberty also returned to the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup final but were denied a repeat by the Minnesota Lynx. This time around, the 32 wins were good enough to secure the top seed on the WNBA playoff bracket, which saw the Liberty sweep the eighth-ranked Atlanta Dream in two games before defeating the Aces 3–1 in the semifinals. New York won its first WNBA Championship beating the Minnesota Lynx in the 2024 WNBA Finals.

<doc id="180638" wikidata="Q177477" url="?curid=180638" title="Baikonur Cosmodrome">
<text>The Baikonur Cosmodrome is a spaceport operated by Russia within Kazakhstan. Located in the Kazakh city of Baikonur, it is the largest operational space launch facility in terms of area. All Russian crewed spaceflights are launched from Baikonur.

Situated in the Kazakh Steppe, some above sea level, it is to the east of the Aral Sea and north of the Syr Darya. It is close to Töretam, a station on the Trans-Aral Railway. Russia, as the official successor state to the Soviet Union, has retained control over the facility since 1991; it originally assumed this role through the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), but ratified an agreement with Kazakhstan in 2005 that allowed it to lease the spaceport until 2050. It is jointly managed by Roscosmos and the Russian Aerospace Forces.

In 1955, the Soviet Ministry of Defence issued a decree and founded the Baikonur Cosmodrome. It was originally built as the chief base of operations for the Soviet space program. The Cosmodrome served as the launching point for Sputnik 1 and Vostok 1. The launchpad used for both missions was renamed &quot;Gagarin&#x27;s Start&quot; in honour of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, who piloted Vostok 1 and became the first human in outer space. Under the current Russian management, Baikonur remains a busy spaceport, with numerous commercial, military, and scientific missions being launched annually.

==History==

===Soviet era===
The Soviet government issued Scientific Research Test Range No. 5 (NIIP-5; ) on 12 February 1955. It was actually founded on 2 June 1955, originally a test center for the world&#x27;s first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the R-7 Semyorka. NIIP-5 was soon expanded to include launch facilities for space flights. The site was selected by a commission led by General Vasily Voznyuk, influenced by Sergey Korolyov, the Chief Designer of the R-7 ICBM, and soon the man behind the Soviet space program. It had to be surrounded by plains, as the radio control system of the rocket required (at the time) receiving uninterrupted signals from ground stations hundreds of kilometres away. Additionally, the missile trajectory had to be away from populated areas. Also, it is advantageous to place space launch sites closer to the equator, as the surface of the Earth has higher rotational speed in such areas. Taking these constraints into consideration, the commission chose Tyuratam, a village in the heart of the Kazakh Steppe. The expense of constructing the launch facilities and the several hundred kilometres of new road and train lines made the Cosmodrome one of the most costly infrastructure projects undertaken by the Soviet Union. A supporting town was built around the facility to provide housing, schools, and infrastructure for workers. It was raised to city status in 1966 and named Leninsk ().

The American U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance plane found and photographed the Tyuratam missile test range for the first time on 5 August 1957.

In April 1975, in preparation for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first NASA astronauts were allowed to tour the cosmodrome. Upon their return to the United States, the crews commented that on their evening flight to Moscow they had seen lights on launch pads and related complexes for more than 15 minutes, and according to astronaut Thomas Stafford, &quot;that makes Cape Kennedy look very small.&quot;

====Name====
According to most sources, the name &quot;Baikonur&quot; was deliberately chosen in 1961 (around the time of Gagarin&#x27;s flight) to misdirect the Western Bloc to a place about northeast of the launch center, the small mining town and railway station of Baikonur near Jezkazgan. Leninsk, the closed city built to support the cosmodrome, was renamed Baikonur on 20 December 1995 by Boris Yeltsin.

According to NASA&#x27;s history of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the name &quot;Baikonur&quot; was not chosen to misdirect, but was the name of the Tyuratam region before the establishment of the cosmodrome.
====Environmental impact====
Russian scientist Afanasiy Ilich Tobonov researched mass animal deaths in the 1990s and concluded that the mass deaths of birds and wildlife in the Sakha Republic were noted only along the flight paths of space rockets launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome. Dead wildlife and livestock were usually incinerated, and the participants in these incinerations, including Tobonov himself, his brothers and inhabitants of his native village of Eliptyan, commonly died from stroke or cancer. In 1997, the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation changed the flight path and removed the ejected rocket stages near Nyurbinsky District, Russia.

Scientific literature collected data that indicated adverse effects of rockets on the environment and the health of the population. UDMH, a fuel used in some Russian rocket engines, is highly toxic. It is one of the reasons for acid rains and cancers in the local population, near the cosmodrome. Valery Yakovlev, a head of the laboratory of ecosystem research of the State scientific-production union of applied ecology &quot;Kazmechanobr&quot;, notes:
&quot;Scientists have established the extreme character of the destructive influence of the &quot;Baikonur&quot; space center on environment and population of the region: 11 000 tons of space scrap metal, polluted by especially toxic UDMH is still laying on the falling grounds&quot;. Scrap recovery is part of the local economy.

====Importance====
Many historic flights lifted off from Baikonur: the first operational ICBM; the first man-made satellite, Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957; the first spacecraft to travel close to the Moon, Luna 1, on 2 January 1959; the first crewed and orbital flight by Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961; and the flight of the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, in 1963. 14 cosmonauts of 13 other nations, including Czechoslovakia, East Germany, India and France have launched from Baikonur under the Interkosmos program as well. In 1960, a prototype R-16 ICBM exploded before launch, killing over 100 people. Baikonur is also the site from which Venera 9 and Mars 3 were launched.

===Post-Soviet era===
Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian space program continued to operate from Baikonur under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia wanted to sign a 99-year lease for Baikonur, but agreed to a US$115 million annual lease of the site for 20 years with an option for a 10-year extension. On 8 June 2005, the Russian Federation Council ratified an agreement between Russia and Kazakhstan extending Russia&#x27;s rent term of the spaceport until 2050. The rent pricewhich remained fixed at per yearis the source of a long-running dispute between the two countries. In an attempt to reduce its dependency on Baikonur, Russia built the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Amur Oblast.

Baikonur has been a major part of Russia&#x27;s contribution to the International Space Station (ISS), as it is the only spaceport from which Russian missions to the ISS are launched. It is primarily the border&#x27;s position (but to a lesser extent Baikonur&#x27;s position at about the 46th parallel north) that led to the 51.6° orbital inclination of the ISS; the lowest inclination that can be reached by Soyuz boosters launched from Baikonur without flying over China. With the conclusion of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program in 2011, Baikonur became the sole launch site used for crewed missions to the ISS until the launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2 in 2020.

In 2019, Gagarin&#x27;s Start hosted three crewed launches, in March, July and September, before being shut down for modernisation for the new Soyuz-2 rocket with a planned first launch in 2023. The final launch from Gagarin&#x27;s Start took place 25 September 2019. 
Gagarin&#x27;s Start failed to receive funding (in part due to Russian invasion of Ukraine) to modernize it for the slightly larger Soyuz-2 rocket. In 2023, it was announced that the Russian and Kazakhstan authorities plan to deactivate the site as a space launch pad and turn it into a museum (in part for tourism purposes).

On 7 March 2023, the Kazakh government seized control of the Baiterek launch complex, one of the launch sites at Baikonur Cosmodrome, banning numerous Russian officials from leaving the country and preventing the liquidation of assets by Roscosmos. One of the reasons for the seizure was due to Russia failing to pay a $29.7 million debt to the Kazakh government. The seizure comes after Russia&#x27;s relations with Kazakhstan became tense due to its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

== Features ==
Baikonur is fully equipped with facilities for launching both crewed and uncrewed spacecraft. It has supported several generations of Russian spacecraft: Soyuz, Proton, Tsyklon, Dnepr, Zenit and Buran.

Downrange from the launchpad, spent launch equipment is dropped directly on the ground in the Russian far east where it is salvaged by the workers and the local population.

===Buran facilities===

As part of the Buran programme, several facilities were adapted or newly built for the Buran-class space shuttle orbiters:

* Site 110 – Used for the launch of the Buran-class orbiters. Like the assembly and processing hall at Site 112, the launch complex was originally constructed for the Soviet lunar landing program and later converted for the Energia-Buran program.
* Site 112 – Used for orbiter maintenance and to mate the orbiters to their Energia launchers (thus fulfilling a role similar to the VAB at KSC). The main hangar at the site, called MIK RN or MIK 112, was originally built for the assembly of the N1 Moon rocket. After cancellation of the N-1 program in 1974, the facilities at Site 112 were converted for the Energia-Buran program. It was here that orbiter 1K was stored after the end of the Buran program and was destroyed when the hangar roof collapsed in 2002.
* Site 251 – Used as Buran orbiter landing facility, also known as Yubileyniy Airfield (and fulfilling a role similar to the SLF at KSC). It features one runway, called 06/24, which is long and wide, paved with &quot;Grade 600&quot; high quality reinforced concrete. At the edge of the runway were two special mate–demate devices; PUA-100 was designed to lift Buran orbiters and complete Energia stages onto the Antonov An-225 Mriya carrier aircraft and the smaller PKU-50 was used with the Myasishchev VM-T Atlant and incomplete orbiters or segments of the Energia core stage. After arrival on one of the transport aircraft, an orbiter was loaded onto a transporter, which would carry the orbiter to the processing building at Site 254. A purpose-built orbiter landing control facility, housed in a large multi-store office building, was located near the runway. Yubileyniy Airfield was also used to receive heavy transport planes carrying elements of the Energia-Buran system. After the end of the Buran program, Site 251 was abandoned but later reopened as a commercial cargo airport. Besides serving Baikonur, Kazakh authorities also use it for passenger and charter flights from Russia.
* Site 254 – Built to service the Buran-class orbiters between flights (thus fulfilling a role similar to the OPF at KSC). Constructed in the 1980s as a special four-bay building, it also featured a large processing area flanked by several floors of test rooms. After cancellation of the Buran program it was adapted for pre-launch operations of the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft.

===Intra-site railway===
All Baikonur&#x27;s logistics are based on its own intra-site gauge railway network, which is the largest industrial railway on the planet. The railway is used for all stages of launch preparation, and all spacecraft are transported to the launchpads by the special Schnabel cars. Once part of the Soviet Railroad Troops, the Baikonur Railway is now served by a dedicated civilian state company. There are several rail links connecting the Baikonur Railway to the public railway of Kazakhstan and the rest of the world.

===On-site airports===
The Baikonur Cosmodrome has two on-site multi-purpose airports, serving both the personnel transportation needs and the logistics of space launches (including the delivery of the spacecraft by planes). There are scheduled passenger services from Moscow to the smaller Krayniy Airport , which however are not accessible to the public. The larger Yubileyniy Airport (Юбилейный аэропорт) was where the Buran orbiter was transported to Baikonur on the back of the Antonov An-225 &quot;Mriya&quot; cargo aircraft.

==ICBM testing==
Although Baikonur has always been known around the world as the launch site of Soviet and Russian space missions, from its outset in 1955 and until the collapse of the USSR in 1991 the primary purpose of this center was to test liquid-fueled ballistic missiles. The official (and secret) name of the center was State Test Range No. 5 or 5 GIK. It remained under the control of the Soviet and Russian Ministry of Defense until the second half of the 1990s, when the Russian civilian space agency and its industrial contractors started taking over individual facilities.

In 2006, the head of Roscosmos, Anatoly Perminov, said that the last Russian military personnel would be removed from the Baikonur facility by 2007. However, on 22 October 2008, an SS-19 Stiletto missile was test-fired from Baikonur, indicating this may not be the case.

==Future projects==

On 22 December 2004, Kazakhstan and Russia signed a contract establishing the &quot;Russia–Kazakhstan Baiterek JV&quot; joint venture, in which each country holds a 50% stake. The goal of the project was the construction of the Bayterek (&quot;poplar tree&quot;) space launch complex, to facilitate operations of the Russian Angara rocket launcher. This was anticipated to allow launches with a payload of 26 tons to low Earth orbit, compared to 20 tons using the Proton system. An additional benefit would be that the Angara uses kerosene as fuel and oxygen as the oxidiser, which is less hazardous to the environment than the toxic fuels used by older boosters. The total expenditure on the Kazakh side was expected to be US$223 million over 19 years. As of 2010, the project was stalling due to insufficient funding, but it was thought that the project still had good chances to succeed because it would allow both parties – Russia and Kazakhstan – to continue the joint use of Baikonur even after the construction of Vostochny Cosmodrome. As of 2017, the first launch of the Baiterek Rocket and Space Complex was expected to occur in 2025.

==Baikonur Museum==
The Baikonur Cosmodrome has a small museum, next to two small cottages, once residences of the rocket engineer Sergei Korolev and the first cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin. Both cottages are part of the museum complex and have been preserved. The museum is home to a collection of space artefacts. A restored test article from the Soviet Buran programme sits next to the museum entrance. The only completed orbiter, which flew a single orbital test mission in 1988, was destroyed in a hangar collapse in 2002. For a complete list of surviving Buran vehicles and artefacts, see Buran programme § List of vehicles.

The museum also houses photographs related to the cosmodrome&#x27;s history, including images of all cosmonauts. Every crew of every expedition launched from Baikonur leaves behind a signed crew photograph that is displayed behind the glass.

Baikonur&#x27;s museum holds many objects related to Gagarin, including the ground control panel from his flight, his uniforms, and soil from his landing site, preserved in a silver container. One of the museum rooms also holds an older version of the Soyuz descent capsule.

In 2021, the Baikonur space complex was named as one of the top 10 tourist destinations in Kazakhstan.

In 2023, a plan was announced to add the Gagarin&#x27;s Start launch complex to the museum complex at Baikonur.

<text>Baikonur ( ; ) is a city in Kazakhstan on the northern bank of the Syr Darya river. It is currently leased and administered by the Russian Federation as an enclave until 2050. It was constructed to serve the Baikonur Cosmodrome with administrative offices and employee housing. During the Soviet period, the town was known as Leninsk, and was sometimes referred to as Zvezdograd (). It was officially renamed Baikonur by Russian president Boris Yeltsin on December 20, 1995. 

The Russian controlled area is an ellipse measuring east to west by north to south, with the cosmodrome situated at the area&#x27;s centre.

Foreign visitors and tourists can visit the cosmodrome and city but need to obtain a specific permit from Roscosmos.

==History==
The original Baikonur (Kazakh for &quot;wealthy brown&quot;, i.e. &quot;fertile land with many herbs&quot;) is a mining town 320 kilometres northeast of the present location, near Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan&#x27;s Karagandy Region. Starting with Vostok 1 in April 1961, the launch site was given this name to cause confusion and keep the location secret. (The original Baikonur&#x27;s residents took advantage of the confusion by ordering and receiving many scarce materials before government officials discovered the deception.) Baikonur&#x27;s railway station predates the base and retains the old name of Tyuratam. This was the original Soviet railway station (railhead) on the Moscow to Tashkent Railway that the Cosmodrome was initially named after.

The fortunes of the city have varied according to those of the Soviet or Russian space program and its Baikonur Cosmodrome. 

Due to the city&#x27;s military and scientific significance, it was closed off by Soviet authorities. It did not appear on maps available to the general public during the Soviet period prior to perestroika.

The Soviet government established the Nauchno-Issledovatel&#x27;skii Ispytatel&#x27;nyi Poligon N.5 (NIIIP-5), or Scientific-Research Test Range N.5 by its decree of 12 February 1955. The U-2 high-altitude reconnaissance plane found and photographed the Tyuratam missile test range (cosmodrome Baikonur) for the first time on 5 August 1957.

The town has unique ties with space, and hence the history of the rocket building and space binds all the sights in the area and the cosmodrome. However, there are only a few exceptions: old locomotive, an Orthodox Church and a new mosque.

The city administratively belongs to the Odintsovsky District of Moscow Oblast.

==Climate==
Baikonur features a cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;). Summers are hot with July highs averaging slightly over , while winters are cold, with longer periods of sustained below-freezing temperatures.

==Places of interest==
South of city center, near the Syr Darya River there is a large park with several sports and amusement facilities. Among these is a ferris wheel, which is no longer in use. The park is located at coordinates .

<doc id="180673" wikidata="Q1887094" url="?curid=180673" title="Heptagram">
<text>A heptagram, septagram, septegram or septogram is a seven-point star drawn with seven straight strokes.

The name &quot;heptagram&quot; combines a numeral prefix, &quot;hepta-&quot;, with the Greek suffix &quot;&quot;. The &quot;-gram&quot; suffix derives from &quot;γραμμῆ&quot; (&quot;grammē&quot;) meaning a line.

==Geometry==
In general, a heptagram is any self-intersecting heptagon (7-sided polygon).

There are two &quot;regular&quot; heptagrams, labeled as {7/2} and {7/3}, with the second number representing the vertex interval step from a regular heptagon, {7/1}.

This is the smallest star polygon that can be drawn in two forms, as irreducible fractions. The two heptagrams are sometimes called the &quot;heptagram&quot; (for {7/2}) and the &quot;great heptagram&quot; (for {7/3}).

The previous one, the regular hexagram {6/2}, is a compound of two triangles. The smallest star polygon is the {5/2} pentagram.

The next one is the {8/3} octagram and its related {8/2} star figure (a compound of two squares), followed by the regular enneagram, which also has two forms: {9/2} and {9/4}, as well as one compound of three triangles {9/3}.

==Uses==
===Flags and heraldry===
* The seven-pointed star is incorporated into the flags of various bands of Cherokee Indians and the badges of Navajo Nation Police (as well as other police).
* The Bennington flag, a historical American Flag, has thirteen seven-pointed stars along with the numerals &quot;76&quot; in the canton.
* The Flag of Jordan contains a seven-pointed star.
* The Flag of Australia employs five heptagrams and one pentagram to depict the Southern Cross constellation and the Commonwealth Star.
* Some old versions of the coat of arms of Georgia (country) including the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic used the {7/2} heptagram as an element.
* A seven-pointed star is used as the badge in many sheriff&#x27;s departments and some smaller-community police departments.
*A seven-pointed star is used in the otherkin pride flag.

=== Law enforcement ===
===Religious and occult symbolism===

* The heptagram became a traditional symbol for warding off evil in Catholicism.
* The symbol is also used in Kabbalist Judaism.
* The heptagram is used in the symbol for Babalon in Aleister Crowley&#x27;s occult system Thelema.
* The heptagram is known among neopagans as the &quot;Elven Star&quot; or &quot;Fairy Star&quot;. It is treated as a sacred symbol in various modern pagan and witchcraft traditions. Blue Star Wicca also uses the symbol, where it is referred to as a &quot;septegram&quot;. The second heptagram is a symbol of magical power in some pagan spiritualities.
* In alchemy, a seven-sided star can refer to the seven planets which were known to early alchemists, and also, the seven alchemical substances: fire, water, air, earth, sulphur, salt and mercury.
* In astrology. For example, the planetary hours, from which comes the names of the days of the week.
* In Polynesia, the seven-pointed star is used often in imagery, basket making, tattoos, and is considered to be a symbol of Kanaloa, the first Polynesian navigator.
* The seven-sided star is an important symbol of the Cherokee people of southern Appalachia, representing the seven clans of the Cherokee and the sacred number seven.

===In popular culture===
* The logo of American shoe brand DC Shoes features a 7/3 heptagram in the letter C. 
* The seven-pointed star is used as the logo for the international Danish shipping company A.P. Moller–Maersk Group, sometimes known simply as Maersk.
* In George R. R. Martin&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; and its TV version Game of Thrones, a seven-pointed star serves as the symbol of the Faith of the Seven.
* In the manga series MeruPuri, a magical mirror/ portal is in the shape of a heptagram. The symbol is also seen during spellcasting.
* Finnish rock band HIM used a heptagram on the cover of their eighth studio album Tears on Tape.
* American heavy metal band Darkest Hour used a heptagram on the cover of their eighth studio album Darkest Hour.
* English Singer Damon Albarn uses a heptagram as a symbol in his solo performances and with his band Blur.
* The {7/3} heptagram is used by some members of the otherkin subculture as an identifier.
* The American Progressive Rock Metal Band “Tool” uses an ‘open’ seven pointed symbol for their fan group. It is ‘open’ to signify an invitation into the collective unconscious.
* An alternate logo of Chicago-based Children&#x27;s Press from 1945 to 1970, having the slogan &quot;Children&#x27;s Books Are Important&quot;.

<text>The Esperanto Association of Britain (EAB) is a registered educational charity whose objective is to advance education in and about the international language Esperanto and to preserve and promote the culture and heritage of Esperanto for the educational benefit of the general public. The organisation was established in 1904.

Among its activities it publishes, provides and distributes information about the language and organises educational courses, lectures and conferences. It also provides a comprehensive bookshop with material from around the world.

==Publications==

In January 1905, the British Esperanto Association launched its official organ, The British Esperantist. as a monthly publication. The publication was retitled as La Brita Esperantisto (and for a short while LBE for 2010 to 2014). The frequency of the publication varied. Initially it was a monthly and later on starting World War II as once every two months. It turned into a quarterly in 1991, then semi-annually with two issues (Autumn and Spring). 

Other regular publications include Update (a newsletter mainly in English with news of activities related to the language).

==Offices==
In earlier years, the offices of EAB were located at 17 Hart Street, London WC1, then 140 Holland Park Avenue, London W11. However, in April 2001, due to the cost of maintaining the building, the offices were relocated to a converted outbuilding at the Wedgwood Memorial College, Barlaston, Staffordshire, where they remain today, and where one of the largest and most important collections of material in and about Esperanto is to be found in the Montagu Butler Library.

<text>Tralee ( ; , ; formerly , meaning &#x27;strand of the River Lee&#x27;) is the county town of County Kerry in the south-west of Ireland. The town is on the northern side of the neck of the Dingle Peninsula, and is the largest town in County Kerry. The town&#x27;s population was 26,079 as of the 2022 census, making it the 15th largest urban settlement in Ireland. Tralee is known for the Rose of Tralee International Festival, which has been held annually in August since 1959.

==History==

Situated at the confluence of some small rivers and adjacent to marshy ground at the head of Tralee Bay, Tralee is located at the base of an ancient roadway that heads south over the Slieve Mish Mountains. On this old track is located a large boulder sometimes called Scotia&#x27;s Grave, reputedly the burial place of an ancient queen.

Anglo-Normans founded the town in the 13th century, which became a stronghold of the Earls of Desmond, who built Tralee Castle. John Fitz-Thomas FitzGerald founded the monastery of the Dominican order and was buried there in 1260. The medieval town was burnt in 1580 in retribution for the Desmond Rebellions against Elizabeth I.

Elizabeth I in 1587 granted Tralee to Edward Denny and it was recognised in 1613 by Royal Charter. Sir Edward was the first of the Dennys to settle in Tralee; the Dennys did not occupy the castle of the Earls of Desmond until 1627 but lived instead at Carrignafeela Castle. Sir Edward&#x27;s son was Arthur Denny, in whose lifetime the town&#x27;s charter was granted by King James, containing the right to elect two members of parliament. The third English settler, another Sir Edward, married Ruth Roper, whose father Thomas Roper was the lease holder of the Herbert estate centred on Castleisland. This Sir Edward was a royalist. He fought for the King in the wars of 1641. He died in 1646, before the triumph of Oliver Cromwell over affairs in England and Ireland.

He granted &quot;the circuit of the Abbey&quot; to the corporation set up under the charter, in return for the fees of the town clerk. His son Arthur Denny married Ellen Barry, granddaughter of Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork. The latter held many land titles in West Kerry and also claimed property in Tralee. Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet was a notable landlord in his day: during the time of the Great Famine, he maintained rents to suit his tenants, when other landowners increased them. He was a notable Plymouth Brother.

The modern layout of Tralee was created in the 19th century. Denny Street, a wide Georgian street, was completed in 1826 on the site of the old castle. A monument commemorating the 1798 rebellion plus the rebellions of 1803, 1848 and 1867 – a statue of a Pikeman – stands in Denny Street. First unveiled in 1905, the original Pikeman stood until the Irish War of Independence. In 1921 the Black and Tans dragged it from its pedestal and destroyed it. In June 1939 a replacement Pikeman was installed, created by renowned Dublin sculptor Albert Power and unveiled by Maud Gonne.
Tralee Courthouse was designed by William Vitruvius Morrison and built in 1834. It has a monument of two cannons commemorating those Kerrymen who died in the Crimean War (1854–56) and the Indian Rebellion (1857). Ballymullen Barracks was the depot of the Royal Munster Fusiliers.
The Tralee Ship Canal was built to accommodate larger ships sailing into Tralee, as the existing quay in Blennerville was becoming blocked due to silting. The House of Commons authorised an Act of Parliament in June 1829 for the canal, with work beginning in 1832. Issues with funding meant that the canal was not completed until 1846 when it was opened. The canal was 2 miles long with a new canal basin built in Tralee, and lock gates and a wooden swing bridge constructed in Blennerville. However, not long after the canal opened, it too began to suffer from silting.

By the 1880s, Fenit Harbour was built as a deepwater harbour; it did not suffer from silting. A railway line was constructed between the harbour and Tralee to carry cargo and freight from ships moored there. The canal fell into disuse and neglect, and was finally closed by the mid-20th century. Following the restoration of Blennerville Windmill in the early 1990s, local authorities planned restoration of the canal for use as a tourist attraction. In 1999 the Office of Public Works (OPW) started a restoration project of the canal at a cost of IR£650,000. The basin area of the canal was subsequently redeveloped with apartments blocks built as part of a proposed marina. The towpath along the canal was upgraded and is now used by people as an enjoyable amenity as part of the Dingle Way.

The Dominican church of the Holy Cross was designed by the Irish Gothic Revival architect George Ashlin in 1866 and built by 1871.

===War of Independence and Civil War===

Tralee saw much violence during the Irish War of Independence and Irish Civil War in 1919–1923. In November 1920, the Black and Tans besieged Tralee in revenge for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) abduction and killing of two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men. The Tans closed all the businesses in the town and did not let any food in for a week. They burned several houses and all businesses connected with IRA activists. In the course of the week, they shot dead three local people. The events caused a major international outcry as the press reported that near-famine conditions were prevailing in Tralee by the end of the week.
In August 1922 during the Irish Civil War, Irish Free State troops landed at nearby Fenit and took Tralee from its Anti-Treaty garrison. Nine pro-Treaty and three anti-Treaty soldiers were killed in fighting in the town before the anti-Treaty forces withdrew. The Republicans continued a guerrilla campaign in the surrounding area. In March 1923 Free State troops took nine anti-treaty IRA prisoners from the prison in Tralee and blew them up with a land mine at nearby Ballyseedy. Only Stephen Fuller, a future Irish politician, survived the explosion.
The Ashe Memorial Hall was built in 1928 at the end of Denny Street; it is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Ashe, an Irish Volunteers officer in the Easter Rising of 1916. The building is built of local sandstone. It housed the headquarters of Kerry County Council and Tralee Urban District Council; both now have moved to other premises. Since 1992 it has housed the Kerry County Museum, which includes a reconstruction of Tralee as of 1450, prior to colonisation.

==Climate==
The climate of Tralee is, like the rest of Ireland, classified as a maritime temperate climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. Met Éireann maintains a climatological weather station at Valentia Island, 50 km south-west of the town. It is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. The hottest months of the year are July, August, and September with temperatures of around 17 – 18 degrees Celsius. Tralee gets rainfall all year round and the wettest months are October, November, December, and January.

==Local government==
Tralee had a town council with twelve members until the 2014 local elections were held on 23 May 2014. These elections were held following the changes effected by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. County Kerry is divided into six local electoral areas (LEA) for elections to Kerry County Council. The members elected for the Tralee LEA sit as the Tralee Municipal District.

==Places of interest==

==Rose of Tralee==

The Rose of Tralee festival is an international competition that is celebrated among Irish communities all over the world. The festival, held annually in August since 1959, takes its inspiration from a nineteenth-century ballad of the same name about a woman called Mary, who because of her beauty was called The Rose of Tralee. The contest, broadcast over two nights by RTÉ, is one of the highest-viewed shows on Irish television with over a million people watching.

To commemorate the Rose of Tralee tradition, the Rose Garden in the Tralee Town Park is home to a life-size bronze statue depicting the original Rose of Tralee Mary O&#x27;Connor and the author of the Rose of Tralee ballad William Pembroke Mulchinock sculpted by an Irish sculptor Jeanne Rynhart (unveiled in 2009), as well as the Rose Wall of Honour – a series of glass panels that will contain the name of every Rose who has participated in the Festival since 1959 (unveiled in 2013 on the 55th anniversary of the Rose of Tralee International Festival). Both statues were commissioned by Tralee Town Council.

==Archaeological sites==
Archaeological sites around Tralee and throughout the County of Kerry, including a number of ring-forts, are listed for preservation in the Kerry County Development Plan 2009–15. These include Casement&#x27;s Fort, an ancient ring fort where Roger Casement had been hiding before his arrest. There is also an Iron Age fort at Caherconree, overlooking Tralee Bay.

An example of a Sheela na gig is now located in the Christian Round Tower at Rattoo, Ballyduff, a few kilometres north of Tralee. There is also a monument to Saint Brendan the Navigator at Fenit, with reproductions of ancient Irish structures.

==Media==
The town has two local weekly newspapers, &quot;The Kerryman&quot; and &quot;Kerry&#x27;s Eye&quot; while the &quot;Tralee Outlook&quot; and &quot;Tralee Advertiser&quot; are also published weekly.

The town has a commercial radio station, Radio Kerry, which commenced operations in 1990. Spin South West also had a studio on Castle Street, which opened in 2016 but is now vacant.

==Transport==

From the Dublin-Cork line, there are connecting trains at Limerick Junction for Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford. Further links are available at Limerick to Ennis, Athenry, Oranmore, and Galway.

The current Tralee railway station, Casement station named after Roger Casement, was opened on 18 July 1859. There were also two other adjacent stations, now closed and demolished, in the North Circular Road area. One was the terminus of the &quot;North Kerry&quot; line which ran to Limerick via Listowel and Newcastle West, and the other was the terminus of the narrow gauge Tralee and Dingle Light Railway.

The Tralee and Dingle Light Railway was once one of Europe&#x27;s most western railways. It opened on 31 March 1891, connecting Tralee and Dingle by rail along the Dingle Peninsula, and was closed in June 1953. In 1993 a 3 km section was reopened as a preserved line between the Aquadome in Tralee and Blennerville Windmill. Currently this railway is no longer in operation.

A standard gauge railway used to operate to Fenit Harbour from Tralee, diverging from the North Kerry line to the northwest of the town, before closing in June 1978. Currently a section of this railway has been restored as a walk/cycle way in the Tralee urban area and it is hoped in the future that this will be extended to Fenit, similar along the lines of the Great Southern Trail which has been created on the closed North Kerry line route in western County Limerick.

<text>The RijnGouweLijn (), or RGL, was a proposed light rail project in South Holland, Netherlands, that used some new tracks and some existing tracks from the Gouda–Alphen aan den Rijn railway and the Woerden–Leiden railway. However, the new section might have used bus rapid transit (BRT) instead.

From 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles operated on the Gouda–Alphen aan den Rijn railway, sharing these tracks with regular NS stock. As of 2013, only NS stock is used on the railway.

==Original plan==
The RGL would have been the first system in the Netherlands where light rail vehicles shared heavy rail tracks with heavy rail trains, similar to the tram-train systems around Karlsruhe and Saarbrücken, Germany. This shared track runs from Gouda through Alphen aan den Rijn to Leiden. The existing heavy rail track was to be adapted and seven additional stops added.

For Leiden, the plan was to have new track through the centre (Breestraat) at street level (alternatives that were proposed were around the centre on existing track, or in a tunnel through the centre). The province of South Holland was in favour of this, but based on a referendum in March 2007 among the Leiden population, the municipality was against it. The province threatened to force the municipality to accept a trajectory through Leiden. Following that, the municipality agreed to accept the RGL through the city. The province and municipality then agreed that the route would follow Hooigracht and Langegracht.

The proposed line passed through Leiden Centraal railway station and then used the new tracks to Katwijk with a branch to Noordwijk.

The light-rail vehicles used were of the Bombardier Flexity Swift model, produced in Vienna. The usage of the designation A32 is originally from SL in Stockholm, Sweden.

In the beginning they were used on the regular railway service between Gouda and Alphen aan den Rijn. The stations were adapted by adding new low-level platforms, either as extensions to existing high-level platforms or by building them on the opposite side of the track to the high-level platforms.

From 2003 to 2009 there was test traffic with light rail vehicles on the heavy rail track from Gouda to Alphen aan den Rijn. The RGL was divided into two sub-projects: RGL-East (Gouda-Leiden Transferium &#x27;t Schouw A44) and RGL-West (Leiden Transferium &#x27;t Schouw A44-Katwijk/Noordwijk), both of which were due for completion in late 2015. Completion depended on financial support from the national government, and in the autumn of 2009, State Secretary of Transport Tineke Huizinga indicated that the line to Katwijk would cost €45 million. The line to Noordwijk was to be served by buses in the meantime.

=== Background ===
Long before there was light rail, some of the tracks had tram traffic. In the 1960s, Leiden had the Blue and Yellow Tram lines.

In the 1960s, 70s and 80s plan were often put forward for the tram to return to the previous sections of the Blue and Yellow Tram. The first ideas for the RGL were presented in the early 90s by Boudewijn Leeuwenburgh, the former district chief of NZH. The tram system was initially intended to be a much larger light rail network, with branches to Leiderdorp, the district of Ridderveld in Alphen and Schiphol. There were also suggestions to link the RGL to Randstadrail, for example by establishing the trajectory of Leiden-Zoetermeer and/or Leiden-Leidschendam-Voorburg via Voorschoten. None of the ideas have been implemented.

People soon began to oppose the RGL. Tram traffic was seen as a hazard for cyclists and pedestrians. There was also criticism of the high construction cost of the project. In the 90s it was budgeted for 450 million guilders (€222 million), but by 2007 the amount had risen to €470 million. There were fears of cuts in city and regional bus networks. Furthermore, there was doubt about the effectiveness of the RGL. The critics were in favour of extending the rail line from Leiden to Utrecht, and investment in dedicated bus lanes on the route from Leiden to Katwijk and Noordwijk.

=== Ridership ===

In the 1990s it was projected that approximately 78,000 passengers a day would use the RGL (total number for the system Gouda-Katwijk/Noordwijk). Despite the negative impact on the bus network in favor of the RGL it was expected that the accessibility of central Leiden would be greatly improved. A track through the centre of Leiden would mean that the travel time for people who have a destination outside Leiden would be significantly longer, and this course had repercussions for the passenger forecast. These estimates were repeatedly reduced. The most recent forecasts a ridership of 50,000 passengers — 42,000 more than in the busiest tram line in Amsterdam (number 5). On the route Leiden-Katwijk/Noordwijk the number of passengers would only be slightly higher than on the current bus network.

=== Eastern section (Gouda - Alphen aan den Rijn - Leiden)===

The section between Gouda and Leiden was originally scheduled to be inaugurated in 2005. This was later postponed to 2007 and later to 2015, simultaneously with western section. From 2003 to 2009 light rail vehicles were used on the existing railway between Gouda and Alphen aan den Rijn. The future RGL would then continue to Leiden Lammenschans railway station. In the period 2012-2014, the whole section would be upgraded to double track.

=== Through Leiden ===

The original plan was that the RGL should continue from Leiden Lammenschans railway station as a city tram to Leiden Central Station. This process was controversial, especially regarding safety, cost and impact on cyclists and the bus network. Especially controversial was a single track section through the Breestraat. Therefore, in addition to the original plan several alternative plans were developed. In one of those alternatives the RGL would follow the existing route of the railway line all the way to Leiden Centraal, or to a point near the station. The railway would be doubled, and perhaps be moved to a concrete overpass above the current track.

These alternative plans were shown to be three to four times more expensive than the originally proposed route through the city centre. On 7 March 2007 a referendum was held in Leiden, on the arrival of the RGL to Leiden (a specific route was not mentioned in the referendum question). 69% of the Leiden inhabitants voted &#x27;no&#x27; to the proposal. Accordingly, the town rejected the RGL, but the province threatened to impose the tram line anyway. This led a majority of the politicians in Leiden to accept, in 2008, an alternative route of the RGL, through Hooigracht/Langegracht.

Whereas the tram in the initial proposal would go through Steenstraat/3e Binnenvestgracht Stationsweg to the station, it was to go through the Lammermarkt and Schuttersveld. According to the last urban vision, the tram would cross the railway in the Rijnsbruger Tunnel instead of the Joop Walenkamp tunnel, implying the removal of the bicycle lane and taxi stop. After Leiden Centraal station, the line would pass the Leiden University Medical Center and the Bio Science Park, reaching Transferium &#x27;t Schouw.

=== Western section (Leiden - Katwijk / Noordwijk) ===

From Transferium &#x27;t Schouw A44, the RGL would go as light rail to Katwijk aan den Rijn, then fork into branches to Katwijk aan Zee and Noordwijk respectively. In 2005, an agreement was signed between all municipalities except the municipality of Leiden to share the costs of the project, with the national government and province covering a large part of the construction cost, and the county bearing all risks for the operation of the line. The western branch of the RGL was also important for the opening of the new building located on the former Valkenburg Naval Air Base.

In Katwijk and Noordwijk there was much opposition to the tram plans, both among the general population and in the town councils. Neither community wanted tram traffic in the town centres. For Noordwijk it would end at the European Space Research and Technology Centre on the border with Katwijk. The municipalities presented an alternative alignment of the RGL. The RGL Noordwijk-Binnen would run to Voorhout station and the NS station at Sassenheim. In Katwijk there was opposition against the branch to Katwijk aan Zee. In both communities the tram line would have to be imposed by the provincial government, as had happened earlier in Leiden. In the autumn of 2009 the national government provided €45 million for the line to Katwijk, but not to Noordwijk. There is a gap of €55 million, for which a solution had to be found.

In June 2009, a preferred route was approved by the Provincial Council of South Holland. Both Katwijk and Noordwijk got a tram to the coast. However, the province addressed the concerns of Katwijk and routed the line not on the Boulevard but to finish in Badstraat.

=== Test traffic with light rail vehicles ===

In March 2003 test traffic was started between Gouda and Alphen aan den Rijn with light rail equipment on existing rail tracks, largely using RGL vehicles. These were Bombardier A32s, a model that is also used on the Tvärbanan light rail line in Stockholm. The grey and blue trams were fitted with yellow stickers to resemble NS &quot;Sprinter&quot; trains. On 13 December 2009, the trial ended and &quot;Sprinter&quot; trains took over the line. The A32 trams were sold to Stockholm.

====Lower platforms====
In North Waddinxveen the existing platform was extended with a low wooden platform. At Boskoop the island platform was considerably extended and this is the only concrete platform apart from the platform at Gouda. In Alphen aan den Rijn a new 4LR wooden platform was built along the old freight track. There is a fence between the two separate tracks, to improve driver safety as the cab door opens directly onto the track, not on the platform.

Because the trains are wider than the A32 trams, extra warning stripes were placed along the platforms to warn passengers of the height/width difference in alighting and boarding.

The operation suffered from frequent signal interference caused by malfunctioning axle counters and/or ATP-NG-train security. Soon the RGL got a bad reputation because of the cancellation of a large number of journeys. However the number of passengers per day, around 5,000, during the period 2003-2009 was stable, despite a large increase in many other rail routes in the Randstad. The six light rail vehicles purchased for the test eventually proved inadequate, also because of the large number of problems they faced.

====End of test====

In August 2009 it was announced that the proposed precursor of the RGL on the Gouda-Alphen route would disappear as of 13 December 2009, because using only Sprinter the train timetables could be improved. A more direct train service between Gouda and Leiden Centraal was introduced, decreasing the travel time by 8 minutes.

=== Future ===

With the route through the Hooigracht/Langegracht in Leiden decided (2008), and the decision of the provincial government on the western route, the future of the RGL was a little clearer, but that did not mean that all obstacles have been overcome. The municipality of Noordwijk refused to cooperate and several parties in the city council of Leiden remained fiercely opposed to the RGL (including D66 and SP, never strong supporters of the RGL).

=== End of the RGL ===

On Wednesday 30 January 2013, the provincial government chose to stop this version of the RGL project. Instead, there were to be more trains, stations and buses.

<text>Remscheid () is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is, after Wuppertal and Solingen, the third-largest municipality in Bergisches Land, being located on the northern edge of the region, on the south side of the Ruhr area.

Remscheid had around 109,000 inhabitants in 2015. At the end of 2019 it had 113,703 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Remscheid comprises four boroughs, &quot;Alt-Remscheid&quot;, &quot;Remscheid-Süd&quot;, &quot;Lennep&quot;, and Lüttringhausen.

Its highest point is the Brodtberg (378 m).

==History==
Remscheid was founded in the 12th century, but remained a small village until the 19th century. Early spellings for the city included &quot;Remissgeid&quot; (1217), &quot;Rymscheyd&quot; (1351), &quot;Reymscheyd&quot; (1487) and &quot;Rembscheid&quot; (1639). The economic growth of the entire Rhine-Ruhr region led to an increase of the population of Remscheid. Mechanical engineering and toolmaking were the main industries practised within the town. This is carried on today with the Hazet tool company which has three factories in Remscheid. Remscheid was part of the Prussian Rhine Province from 1822 to 1945.

On 31 July 1943, during World War II, Remscheid was almost completely destroyed during a British bombing raid which caused a firestorm. This bombing raid was the final operation of RAF&#x27;s Battle of the Ruhr involving 273 aircraft. Today around one third of the city consists of buildings from before World War II. During 14 and 15 April 1945, Remscheid was captured by the 78th Infantry Division (United States).

An A-10 Thunderbolt II crashed in the city on 8 December 1988. Six people died.

==Demographics==
As of 31 December 2019, the city&#x27;s population was 113,703, of which 92,726 (81.6%) were German citizens and 20,977 (18.4%) were non-Germans (&quot;Ausländer&quot;); of the non-German population, the top 10 nationalities represented were as follows:

He is the author of the &quot;Blackcollar&quot; trilogy and the &quot;Cobra&quot; series (nine novels so far), fourteen &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe novels, including thirteen novels featuring Grand Admiral Thrawn: the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Hand of Thrawn&quot; duology, &quot;Outbound Flight&quot;, &quot;Choices of One&quot;, &quot;Thrawn&quot;, &quot;Thrawn: Alliances&quot;, &quot;Thrawn: Treason,&quot; and the &quot;Thrawn Ascendancy&quot; trilogy.

Lucasfilm at times used some of the more detailed &quot;Star Wars: The Roleplaying Game&quot; supplements from West End Games as references, and West End sent boxes of their sourcebooks to Zahn when he started work on a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; novel trilogy. At the time, Zahn was writing &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot; (1991), the first book in what became known as the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, and West End in turn released sourcebooks from 1992–1994 based on Zahn&#x27;s three novels.

The &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy marked a revival in the fortunes of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, bringing it widespread attention for the first time in years; all three &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy novels made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and set the stage and tone for most of the franchise&#x27;s expanded universe content. Zahn also wrote the young adult Dragonback series and the &quot;Conquerors&quot; &quot;trilogy&quot;.

In 2014 Zahn collaborated with David Weber on the Manticore Ascendant series set within the Honorverse.

In 2023, Dave Filoni confirmed during the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration Europe that Zahn served as a creative consultant for the Disney+ miniseries &quot;Ahsoka&quot; in order to assist the creative team in writing Thrawn correctly, as Filoni felt that only Zahn could advise them with the &quot;right&quot; way to adapt Thrawn as the character&#x27;s creator.

<text>Adam of Balsham ( or &quot;&quot;) (c. 1100/1102 – c. 1157/1169) was an Anglo-Norman scholastic and churchman.

==Life==
Adam was born in Balsham, near Cambridge, England. He studied with Peter Lombard at the University of Paris. He later taught in Paris, teaching John of Salisbury and William of Tyre. Further, he may have been a contemporary of Rainald of Dassel (c. 1120 – 14 August 1167) there. Gabriel Nuchelmans surmises that he may have been the first person to introduce the term &quot;enuntiabile&quot;, which came to be used in the same sense as dictum.

Many sources have surmised that Adam of Balsham and Adam, Bishop of St Asaph (or Adam the Welshman) are the same person, but Raymond Klibansky concludes that they were two different men.

The Petit-Pont attached to Adam&#x27;s name and which crosses the Seine linking the west front of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris (and the site of a former bishop&#x27;s palace) to the Left Bank St Michel area would have been the main centre of Adam&#x27;s intellectual group (it was renamed in 2013 with the addition of the name of Cardinal Lustiger: &#x27;Petit-Pont Cardinal Lustiger&#x27;).

<doc id="180697" wikidata="Q19483" url="?curid=180697" title="Hong Kong Island">
<text>Hong Kong Island () is an island in the southern part of Hong Kong. The island, known originally and on road signs simply as &quot;Hong Kong&quot;, had a population of 1,289,500 and a population density of , . It is the second largest island in Hong Kong, with the largest being Lantau Island. Hong Kong Island forms one of the three areas of Hong Kong, with the other two being Kowloon and the New Territories.

In 1842, following the Qing dynasty&#x27;s defeat at the First Opium War (1839–1842), Hong Kong Island was formally ceded in perpetuity to the United Kingdom under the Treaty of Nanking. The City of Victoria was then established on the island by British forces in honour of Queen Victoria. At that time, the island had a population of about 3,000 inhabitants scattered in a dozen fishing villages.

The northern-east part of the island, being known as the Central area is the historical, political, and economic centre of Hong Kong, with many government buildings being in the area, namely the Government House, Central Government Complex, Legislative Council Complex, Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and High Court of Hong Kong. Many financial institutes and banks such as the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, HSBC and Bank of China are also based in the area.

The northern coast of the island forms the southern shore of the Victoria Harbour, which is largely responsible for the development of Hong Kong due to its deep waters favoured by large trade ships. The island is home to many famous tourists sights, such as &quot;The Peak&quot;, Ocean Park, Former Central Police Station Compound, Murray House, and many other historical sites and various large shopping centres. The mountain ranges across the island are also famous for hiking.

The northern part of Hong Kong Island, together with Kowloon and Tsuen Wan New Town, forms the core urban area of Hong Kong. Their combined area is approximately and their combined population is approximately 3,156,500, reflecting a population density of .

The island is often referred to locally as &quot;Hong Kong side&quot; or &quot;Island side&quot;. The suffix &quot;-side&quot; is also applied to other locations in Hong Kong (e.g. China-side and Kowloon Walled City-side), the sole remnant of which being the &quot;Kowloon side&quot; when referring to the two sides of the Victoria Harbour.

==History==

=== Prehistoric and Imperial China period ===
Human settlement of the area dates back 6,000 years ago, as evidenced by Neolithic artifacts discovered in Stanley, Hong Kong Island.

In 214 BC, the Qin dynasty defeated the Baiyue, and absorbed areas of what is now Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. Hong Kong Island was part of the annexed land and was listed under the jurisdiction of Panyu County () of the Nanhai Commandery (). On the sixth year of the Eastern Jin dynasty (AD 331), Hong Kong Island was listed under the jurisdiction of Baoan County (.

Copper coins from the Sui, Tang and Song dynasty were unearthed in where the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club is presently located at, on where Kellett Island would have been prior to the land reclamation connecting the island to Causeway Bay in 1969. This suggests that during these periods of times, the island already had its own commercial activity. Song dynasty copper coins served as universal currency in transregional trade.

During the Wanli period of the Ming dynasty (1573), Hong Kong Island belonged to the territory of Xin&#x27;an County, and remained so until 1661, when the great clearance was issued by the Shunzhi Emperor of the Qing dynasty, forcing residents in coastal areas of Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangnan, and Shandong to move in-land, to prevent the loyalists of the Ming dynasty in Formosa from approaching the shores of the Mainland and seek help from residents of the coastal areas.

The ban was lifted when the remnants of the Ming dynasty were exterminated in 1669, though not many original residents of Hong Kong Island returned to the area. Piracy was rampant in the area until the island was ceded to the United Kingdom in 1842.

=== British colony ===
Following the First Opium War (1839–1842), Hong Kong Island was ceded to Great Britain in 1842 under the Treaty of Nanking and the territory became a Crown colony. At the time, the island&#x27;s population was only 7,450.

==== Japanese invasion and occupation ====
The Second World War was a dark period for Hong Kong. In the 1930s, the British anticipated a Japanese attack on Hong Kong. As Wong Nai Chung Gap was a strategically important location of defence, large-scale defensive works were constructed there, including anti-aircraft batteries, howitzers and machine gun nests.

The Battle of Hong Kong began on 8 December 1941. British, Canadian and Indian armies and the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Forces resisted the Japanese invasion commanded by Sakai Takashi, which began eight hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, the Japanese took control of the Hong Kong skies on the first day of attack and outnumbered the defenders, which retreated from the Gin Drinkers Line and consequently from Kowloon under heavy aerial bombardment and artillery barrage.

On 18 December, the Japanese had conquered North Point, reaching the Wong Nai Chung Gap on the following day. English, Scottish forces and the Canadian Winnipeg Grenadiers vigorously defended the crucial point of Wong Nai Chung Gap, and for a while successfully secured the passage between Central and the secluded southern parts of the island. Japanese casualties were about 600. However, Allied forces there were ultimately defeated by the Japanese on 23 December, and Wong Nai Chung Reservoir was lost. As Wan Chai Gap had also fallen that same day, the British had no choice but to surrender.

Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese on 25 December 1941, thereafter often called &quot;Black Christmas&quot; by locals as the surrender was on Christmas. The Governor of Hong Kong, Mark Young, surrendered in-person at the temporary Japanese headquarters, on the third floor of the Peninsula Hotel, thus beginning the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. Isogai Rensuke became the first Japanese governor of Hong Kong. Hyper-inflation and food rationing followed; and the Japanese declared Hong Kong Dollars illegal. The Japanese enforced a repatriation policy throughout the period of occupation due to the scarcity of food and the possible counter-attack of the Allies. As a result, the unemployed were deported to the Mainland, and the population of Hong Kong had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945.

==== Post Second World War ====
The population of Hong Kong Island grew exponentially after the Second World War and the Communist revolution in China. It became apparent that the lands in the old Central District were insufficient to accommodate the population. Many undeveloped or underdeveloped areas Hong Kong Island such as North Point, Shau Kei Wan, Aberdeen and Wong Chuk Hang began its development and urbanisation. These areas initially started off as industrialised areas, with some areas such as Quarry Bay, Wan Chai and Causeway Bay later becoming new commercial centres when Hong Kong moved away from its period of industrialisation, as these areas provided relatively cheaper rent than the traditional commercial district of Central.

On 1 July 1997, the sovereignty of Hong Kong Island was transferred to the People&#x27;s Republic of China alongside Kowloon Peninsula and the New Territories, ending 156 years of British rule on Hong Kong Island.

In the previous council from 1991 to 1995, Hong Kong Island consisted of two geographical constituencies, Hong Kong Island West and Hong Kong Island East, similar to current arrangements.

==Island Landscape==

==Geography==

Hong Kong Island is the second-largest island of the territory, the largest being Lantau Island. Its area is , including of land reclaimed since 1887 and some smaller scale ones since 1851. It makes up approximately 7% of the total territory. It is separated from the mainland of the territory (Kowloon Peninsula and New Territories) by the Victoria Harbour.

=== Mountains, peaks and hills ===
Most hills across the middle of the island are included within the country parks.


=== Hiking trail ===
The main hiking trail on Hong Kong Island is the Hong Kong Trail, which is 50 kilometers long and is divided into 8 sections. The trail starts in Victoria Gap on the peak and ends in Big Wave Bay. Sections 1 and 2 of the Wilson Trail across the New Territories of Hong Kong and Kowloon also passes through Tai Tam Country Park and its Quarry Bay Extension.

=== Marine reserve ===

The only marine reserve in Hong Kong, the Cape D&#x27;Aguilar Marine Reserve, is located on the southern tip of the island in Cape D&#x27;Aguilar. It was opened in July 1996 and has a sea area of approximately 20 hectares. The reserve was set up for the purpose of the conservation of marine resources, scientific studies and education for the appreciation of precious marine resources. Visits to the marine reserve by the public is discouraged, with water sports and costal recreational activities prohibited in the area. It is managed by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

==Demographics==
As of 2023, the population of Hong Kong Island is approximately 1,188,500, making up approximately 15.8% of the 7,536,100 in Hong Kong. Its population density is higher than the whole of Hong Kong, c. 18,000 per km2. However, the population is heavily concentrated along the northern shore. The combined population of Central and Western, Wan Chai, and Eastern is 925,200, giving this urbanised part of the island a density of around 22,500 per km2, or 58,000 per mi2, in its approximately .

The residents living in the Central and Western District and Wan Chai District have the highest median household income compared with the other districts in Hong Kong. Affluent districts on Hong Kong Island are The Peak, Western Mid-Levels (Conduit Road/Robinson Road/Magazine Gap Road/Kotewall Road etc.), Eastern Mid-Levels (Happy Valley/Tai Hang/Jardine&#x27;s Lookout), Tai Tam, Deep Water Bay and Repulse Bay.

As of 2021, 85% of Hong Kong Island&#x27;s residents are of Chinese descent. The largest ethnic minority groups are Filipinos (5.6%), Indonesians (2.6%), and White people (2.5%) 

As of 2021, 80.4% of Hong Kong Island&#x27;s residents use Cantonese as their usual language, while 10.6% use English and 3.3% use Mandarin. 2.8% of the residents use Chinese dialects other than Cantonese and Mandarin as their usual language and 2.9% use languages not listed above as their usual language.

==Transportation==
===Rail===
Seven of the MTR rapid transit system&#x27;s ten lines service Hong Kong Island. The Island line and South Island line run exclusively on the four districts of Hong Kong Island, with the Island line serving the north shore at 17 stations, and the South Island line connecting four stations on Ap Lei Chau and in Wong Chuk Hang to the north shore at Admiralty station. Five MTR lines – the Tsuen Wan line, the Tseung Kwan O line, the Tung Chung line, the Airport Express – connect the north shore with Kowloon and provide onward service to the New Territories, and the East Rail line which provides another cross-harbour connection upon its extension from Hung Hom station to Admiralty station. In future, the planned North Island line infrastructure project would extend both the Tung Chung line and the Tseung Kwan O line to connect them to each other, forming a route parallel to the middle section of the Island line.

Two other rail systems, Hong Kong Tramways and the Peak Tram, also run exclusively on Hong Kong Island. The former runs mostly parallel to the Island line between Kennedy Town and Shau Kei Wan, with a loop linking Causeway Bay and Happy Valley; the latter is a funicular linking Central District to Victoria Peak.

===Maritime Transport===

Hong Kong Island has four ferry terminals, them being the Central Ferry Piers, North Point Ferry Pier, Sai Wan Ho Ferry Pier and Wan Chai Ferry Pier. Frequently ferry services are provided from these piers to the Kowloon Peninsula and the outlying islands. A departure terminal, the Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal is located in Sheung Wan to provide turbojet ferry services to Macau.

A tourist sightseeing ferry service, branded as the &quot;Water Taxi&quot; is also offered. The ferry service travels in the Victoria Harbour to sightseeing attractions of Hong Kong, such as the Hong Kong Observation Wheel, International Financial Centre, Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade, West Kowloon Cultural District and Kai Tak Cruise Terminal. It has 4 drop off points.

Public piers are also alongside the Victoria Harbour, such as the famous now-demolished Queen&#x27;s Pier in Central and now-relocated Blake Pier in Stanley, which mainly provides passenger pick-up and drop-off services for small barges, yachts and sightseeing boats. Public piers are located mainly along the Victoria Harbour mainly in Causeway Bay, Central, Shau Kei Wan, Wan Chai, and also in Aberdeen, Ap Lei Chau and Stanley, places in the Southern District.

===Roads===
Major roads on Hong Kong Island include Connaught Road, Des Voeux Road, King&#x27;s Road, Queen&#x27;s Road.

===Tunnels===

Hong Kong Island is connected to the Kowloon Peninsula on the mainland by two road-only tunnels (the Cross-Harbour Tunnel and the Western Harbour Crossing), three MTR railway tunnels (East Rail line, Tsuen Wan line and Tung Chung line/Airport Express) and one combined road and MTR rail link tunnel (Eastern Harbour Crossing, containing the Tseung Kwan O line and road traffic in separate parallel conduits).

Besides these harbour crossing tunnels, Hong Kong Island also has two tunnels travelling across the island itself, the Aberdeen Tunnel and Central–Wan Chai Bypass, which were opened in March 1982 and January 2019 respectively.

The Aberdeen Tunnel provides a link from Happy Valley and Wong Chuk Hang, with the toll fee being HK$5.

The Central–Wan Chai Bypass provides a link from Sheung Wan to Wan Chai North and the Eastern Corridor beyond Causeway Bay. It was built as part of the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation and is part of Route 4. The bypass is toll-free.

===Bridges===

There are no bridges between the island and Kowloon, although two bridges – the Ap Lei Chau Bridge, a road bridge, and Aberdeen Channel Bridge, part of the South Island line – connect the Hong Kong island to Ap Lei Chau.

The Ap Lei Chau Bridge is a combination of two bridges, built separately in 1980 and 1994. It was built to accommodate the growing population in Ap Lei Chau, which the residents could only access the island by boats prior to the construction of the bridge.

=== Central-Mid Levels escalator and walkway system ===
The Central-Mid Levels escalator and walkway system is the longest outdoor covered escalator system in the world. It was opened in 1993 with the initiative of providing relief to traffic in the Mid-Levels. It travels from Queen&#x27;s Road Central to Conduit Road, with the total horizontal distance being over 800 m (2,600 ft) and total vertical distance being over 135 m (443 ft). It consists of covered walkways, 16 reversible one-way escalators and 3 reversible one-way travelators. Restaurants, bars and shops can be found alongside the system. Along its use of transporting, it is also a tourist attraction to the many visiting Hong Kong. As of late 2016, around 78,000 pedestrian make their trips using the system.

<text>Hwarang () were an elite warrior group of male youth in Silla, an ancient kingdom of the Korean Peninsula that originated from the mid 6th century and lasted until the early 10th century. There were educational institutions as well as social clubs where members gathered for all aspects of study, originally for arts and culture as well as religious teachings stemming mainly from Korean Buddhism. Chinese sources referred only to the physical beauty of the &quot;Flower Youths&quot;. The history of the hwarang was not widely known until after the National Liberation Day of Korea in 1945, after which the hwarang became elevated to symbolic importance.

The Hwarang were also referred to as &quot;Hyangdo&quot; (), the word hwarang and its colloquial derivatives being used for everything from playboy to shaman or husband of a female shaman. The word remained in common use until the 12th century but with more derogatory connotations.

==Traditional sources for Hwarang==
Information on the Hwarang is mainly found in the historiographical works &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; (1145) and &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; (c. 1285), and the partially extant &quot;Haedong Goseungjeon&quot; (1215), a compilation of biographies of famous monks of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

All three of these works cite primary sources no longer existent, including 1) a memorial stele to Nallang (presumably a Hwarang based upon the suffix &quot;nang&quot;) by the 9th–10th century Silla scholar Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn; 2) an early Tang account of Silla titled the &quot;Xinluo guoji&quot; by the Tang official Ling Hucheng; and 3) &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot;, &quot;Chronicle of the Hwarang&quot;) by Kim Dae-mun, compiled in the early eighth century. In the late 1980s, an alleged &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot; manuscript was discovered in Gimhae, South Korea. Scholar Richard McBride regards it as a forgery.

==History==

===Wonhwa===
According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, two groups of women called Wonhwa preceded the Hwarang. The precise nature and activities of the Wonhwa are also unclear, with some scholars positing they may have actually been court beauties or courtesans. However, considering that they were trained in ethics, this may be a later patriarchal reading into the Wonhwa. Women played a much more prominent social role in pre-Joseon Korea, especially in Silla, which had three reigning queens in its history.

Both sources record that during the reign of Jinheung of Silla, groups of beautiful girls were chosen and taught filial and fraternal piety, loyalty, and sincerity (no firm date is given for this, and some scholars express doubt this even occurred during Jinheung&#x27;s reign). However, the leaders of the two bands of Wonhwa, Nammo (南毛) and Junjeong (俊貞), grew jealous of one another. When Junjeong murdered her rival, the Wonhwa were disbanded. No doubt the details of this origin story are most likely based on myth and legend, despite the facts surrounding the foundation of the sect being true, as supported by various documented sources. First note that the term &quot;wonhwa&quot; is composed of won 源, &quot;source&quot;, and undoubtedly refers to the founders of the sect, while hwa 花, &quot;flower&quot;, is a euphemism for someone who has spent a great deal of time or money in the pursuit of something, i.e. a devotee. In the case of the Wonhwa, devotion to philosophy and the arts. Furthermore, while the names &quot;nammo&quot; and &quot;junjeong&quot; could have been appellations adopted by these two ladies for use in court, one cannot overlook the obvious descriptions they portray. &quot;Nammo&quot; hints at one who is careless yet lucky, or perhaps someone who is innately insightful and therefore lackadaisical about further erudition. &quot;Junjeung&quot; clearly indicates a person who is talented and virtuous, despite the fact that she was the one who succumbed to homicidal tendencies. It would be logical to assume that if someone had to work hard, maybe even struggle with attaining certain goals, that envy might consume them if their counterpart, especially if viewed more as a rival, seemed to reach the same objectives with substantially less effort.

===Origins of the Hwarang===
It is conjectured that the foundation of the Hwarang system originated from the mid 6th century during the King Jinheung of Silla era, but the exact date of establishment is ambiguous: Samguk sagi reports the year of 576 AD, Dongguk Tonggam reports the year of 540 AD, and Sadaham is already recorded as a Hwarang in 562 AD according to Samguk sagi yeoljeon. Although some historians believe that the Hwarang played a big part in the unification of the Three Kingdoms, some historians are unclear about the role that the Hwarang played in the unification; An excerpt aboutSamguk Sagi . According to the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, the Silla king, &quot;concerned about the strengthening of the country ... again issued a decree and chose boys from good families who were of good morals and renamed them &quot;hwarang&quot;.&quot; The actual word used in this chronicle is &quot;hwanang&quot; (花娘), meaning &quot;flower girls&quot;. This suggests that the Hwarang were not originally military in character, as the Wonhwa were not soldiers. 

The youths who were chosen by the Silla Kingdom became the knights and warriors for the Silla dynasty within the age of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. A close relationship did exist between the Hwarang and Buddhism because Buddhism was accepted as a state religion by the royalty and aristocrats within the Silla Kingdom. The Buddhist monks were often mentors for the Hwarang in both physical and spiritual ways. The Hwarang would seek the teachings of these Buddhist monks because they knew that the martial arts practiced by these Buddhist monks were a source through which they could strengthen themselves for greater success in the future and for the benefit of the Silla Kingdom. The monks would train themselves in physical fitness exercises through self-defense techniques, countering the weakening effects of long-term meditation and enabling them to protect themselves from bandits and robbers who tried to steal the donations and charities that were collected by the monks on their pilgrimages. Both the Buddhist monks and the Hwarang would go on journeys to famous mountains to heighten their training and would seek encounters with supernatural beings for protection and the success/prosperous of the Silla Kingdom. Won Gwang Beop Sa (圓光法士) was a Buddhist monk who was asked by the Hwarang to teach them ways to develop aspirations, bravery, and honor, in order to protect the Silla Kingdom from the other kingdoms inhabiting the peninsula. Won Gwang trained these youths in three areas:

# Self-defense capabilities 
# Self-confidence 
# Self-control

Won Gwang taught the youths of the Hwarang to become warriors who could defend their beliefs with martial arts, to be confident in their actions, and to control themselves and their surroundings. Won Gwang gave to these Hwarang teachings in gwonbeop (martial methods or skills) that combined the secret Buddhist monk&#x27;s physical and mental exercises. Won Gwang also proposed 5 principles or guidelines that were later called the &quot;Five Precepts for Secular Life&quot; (Se Sok O Gye; 세속오계; 世俗五戒) which became a list of ethics that the Hwarang could embrace (this is why he is commonly known as &quot;Beop Sa&quot; or &quot;lawgiver&quot;):

# Show allegiance to one&#x27;s sovereign. (&quot;sa·gun·i·chung&quot;; 사군이충; 事君以忠)
# Treat one&#x27;s parents with respect and devotion. (&quot;sa·chin·i·hyo&quot;; 사친이효; 事親以孝)
# Exhibit trust and sincerity amongst friends. (&quot;gyo·u·i·sin&quot;; 교우이신; 交友以信)
# Never retreat in battle. (&quot;im·jeon·mu·toe&quot;; 임전무퇴; 臨戰無退)
# Exercise discretion when taking a life. (&quot;sal·saeng·yu·taek&quot;; 살생유택; 殺生有擇)

These commandments and teachings of Won Gwang were followed by the Hwarang to protect the Silla Kingdom from rival kingdoms and helped unify the nation of Ancient Korea until the fall of the Silla Kingdom.

In 520, King Beopheung had instituted Sino-Korean style reforms and formalized the golpum (bone rank) system. In 527, Silla formally adopted Buddhism as a state religion. The establishment of Hwarang took place in the context of tightening central state control, a complement to the &quot;golpum&quot; system and a symbol of harmony and compromise between the king and the aristocracy.

===History===
With the consolidation and expansion of Silla and intensification of military rivalries among the Three Kingdoms in the 6th century, the Silla court took a more active interest in the Hwarang. Hwarang groups were usually led by a youth of aristocratic standing, and the state appointed a high-ranking official to oversee the organization.

The Hwarang in the later 6th and 7th centuries trained in horsemanship, swordsmanship, archery, javelin and stone throwing, polo, and ladder-climbing. By the seventh century the organization had grown greatly in prestige and numbered several hundred bands.

The &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, compiled by the general and official Kim Bu-sik, emphasizes the military exploits of certain Hwarang, while the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; emphasizes the group&#x27;s Buddhist activities. The biographies section of the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; describes young Hwarang who distinguished themselves in the struggles against the Gaya confederacy and later Baekje and Goguryeo. According to the &quot;Hwarang Segi&quot;, as cited in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; and &quot;Haedong Goseungjeon&quot;, “...able ministers and loyal subjects are chosen from them, and good generals and brave soldiers are born therefrom.” 

The Hwarang were greatly influenced by Buddhist, Confucian, and shamanistic ideals. A Chinese official recorded, &quot;They [Silla] choose fair sons from noble families and deck them out with cosmetics and fine clothes and call them Hwarang. The people all revere and serve them.&quot;

===Disbandment===

After establishing a Unified Silla, the Silla-Tang War, and reestablishing relations with the Tang dynasty, the Hwarang lost much of their influence and prestige during peacetime. This group was reduced to a social club for Silla&#x27;s elite through various names. They would eventually disappear after the fall of Silla, but they lasted through the Koryŏ dynasty until they officially disbanded at the beginning of the Joseon dynasty.

==Hierarchy==
* 원화 – Wonhwa: Royal Female Patron (源花) (disbanded)
* 풍월주 – Pungwolju: Head of the Hwarang (風月主)
* 국선 – Gukseon: Chief Officer of a Hwarang group (國仙)
* 원상화 – Wonsanghwa: First Officer in charge of martial arts training (原上花)
* 상선- Sangseon: Training officers for the Hwarang (上仙)
* 화랑– Hwarang: Members of the Hwarang groups and leaders of the Nangdo (花郞)
* 낭도 – Nangdo: Followers of the Hwarang (郎徒)

Historians have problems figuring out the leadership hierarchy within the Hwarang as they piece together different historical materials. For instance, historians thought the Pungwolju was a government position administering the Hwarang groups, a Hwarang leader, or a previous system within the Hwarang. Historians also dispute the Gukseon as Hwarang leaders appointed by the king or the Hwarang groups elect their members to lead their groups. Some historians believed the Pungwolju and Gukseon ranks might be synonymous with each other, and they both served as Hwarang leaders.

==Five commandments==
Two youths, Gwisan (귀산,貴山) and Chwihang (취항, 取項), approached the Silla monk Won Gwang seeking spiritual guidance and teaching, saying, “We are ignorant and without knowledge. Please give us a maxim which will serve to instruct us for the rest of our lives.”

Won Gwang, who had gained fame for his period of study in Sui China, replied by composing the &quot;Sesok-ogye&quot; (&quot;Five Commandments for Secular Life&quot;; 세속 오계; 世俗五戒). These have since been attributed as a guiding ethos for the Hwarang:

#Loyalty to one&#x27;s lord (&quot;sagun ichung&quot;; 사군이충; 事君以忠; 나라에 충성하고)
#Love and respect your parents (&quot;sachin ihyo&quot;; 사친이효; 事親以孝; 부모님께 효도하고)
#Trust among friends (&quot;gyo-u isin&quot;; 교우이신; 交友以信; 믿음으로 벗을 사귀고)
#Never retreat in battle (&quot;imjeon mutwae&quot;; 임전무퇴; 臨戰無退; 싸움에 나가서는 물러서지 않으며)
#Never take a life without a just cause (&quot;salsaeng yutaek&quot;; 살생유택; 殺生有擇; 살아있는 것을 함부로 죽이지 않는다)

The &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; also records that Hwarang members learned the Five Cardinal Confucian Virtues, the Six Arts, the Three Scholarly Occupations, and the Six Ways of Government Service (五常六藝 三師六正).

==Other uses==

Following the fall of Silla, the term &quot;hwarang&quot; survived and changed in meaning again. In Choe Sejin (최세진)&#x27;s 1527 book &quot;Hunmong jahoe&quot; (훈몽자회), the term &quot;hwarang&quot; is even referred to as a male prostitute. Today, Hwarang is often used in the names of various schools, organizations and companies.

* The Taekwondo pattern Hwa-Rang as well as several traditional forms are named in honor of the Hwarang.
* A South Korean cigarette brand issued to the armed forces was called &quot;Hwarang&quot;.
* Hwa Rang Do is a modern Korean martial art that is inspired by the ancient Hwarang warriors and their legacy.
* In the fighting game series &quot;Tekken&quot;, a playable character named Hwoarang is present in the game, and fights with the Tae Kwon Do fighting style.
* Grandmaster Ho Sik Pak named his martial arts federation the &quot;Hwa Rang World Tang Soo Do Federation&quot; in honor of the Hwarang.

<doc id="180703" wikidata="Q77864" url="?curid=180703" title="Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette">
<text>Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette (12 January 1780 – 16 June 1849) was a German theologian and biblical scholar.

==Life and education==
Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette was born 12 January 1780 in Ulla (now part of the municipality of Nohra), Thuringia, where his father was a pastor. As a boy, he was sent to the gymnasium at the nearby city of Weimar. Here he was much influenced by Johann Gottfried von Herder, who frequently examined at the school. In 1799, de Wette entered the University of Jena to study theology, his principal teachers being J. J. Griesbach and H. E. G. Paulus. By the time he submitted his dissertation in September 1804, he was in regular contact at Jena with Jakob Friedrich Fries and Karl David Ilgen, who perhaps led him to his contact with Johann Severin Vater, a scholar whose work he both admired and, in some respects, duplicated independently. He became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Jena after completing his doctorate degree. 

In 1807, de Wette became a professor of theology at Heidelberg, where he came under the influence of Jakob Friedrich Fries (1773–1843), whose hiring he helped arrange (as well as that of Paulus). In 1810, was transferred to a similar chair in the newly founded Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin, where he became friendly with Friedrich Schleiermacher. He was, however, dismissed from Berlin in 1819 on account of his having written a letter of consolation to the mother of Karl Ludwig Sand, the murderer of August Friedrich Ferdinand von Kotzebue. A petition in his favour presented by the senate of the university was unsuccessful, and a decree was issued not only depriving him of the chair, but also banishing him from the Prussian kingdom.

De Wette retired to Weimar, where he occupied his leisure in the preparation of his edition of Martin Luther and in writing the romance &quot;Theodor oder die Weihe des Zweiflers&quot; (1822), in which he describes the education of an evangelical pastor. He began preaching, at which he proved to be very popular. In 1822, he accepted the chair of theology in the University of Basel, which had been reorganized four years before. Though his appointment had been strongly opposed by the orthodox party, De Wette soon won for himself great influence both in the university and among the people generally. He was admitted a citizen and became rector of the university, which owed to him much of its recovered strength, particularly in the theological faculty.

==Marriages and family==
De Wette married three times, first with Eberhardine Boye, then Henriette, née Frisch, widowed Beck, the mother of Charles Beck, and the third time in 1833 Sophie, née Streckeisen, widow of the Berne pastor Abraham Rudolf von May.

== Studies ==
In his 1805 doctoral dissertation, de Wette proposed that the &quot;book of law&quot; discovered in the temple by the priest Hilkiah as described in 2 Kings 22 was the Book of Deuteronomy. The suggestion has been described by Julius Wellhausen as &quot;the epoch-making opener of the historical criticism of the Pentateuch&quot; which prepared the way for the Supplementary hypothesis. But he also made valuable contributions to other branches of theology. He had, moreover, considerable poetic faculty, and wrote a drama in three acts, entitled &quot;Die Entsagung&quot; (Berlin, 1823). He had an intelligent interest in art, and studied ecclesiastical music and architecture. As a Biblical critic he is sometimes classed with the destructive school, but, as Otto Pfleiderer says (&quot;Development of Theology&quot;), he &quot;occupied as free a position as the Rationalists with regard to the literal authority of the creeds of the church, but that he sought to give their due value to the religious feelings, which the Rationalists had not done, and, with a more unfettered mind towards history, to maintain the connection of the present life of the church with the past.&quot; His works are marked by exegetical skill, unusual power of condensation and uniform fairness. Accordingly, they possess value that is little affected by the progress of criticism.

==Death==
De Wette died in Basel on 16 June 1849.

==Selected works==
His most important works are:
*&quot;Beiträge zur Einleitung in das Alte Testament&quot; (&quot;Contributions to the Introduction of the Old Testament&quot;. 2 vols, 1806–1807).
*&quot;Kommentar über die Psalmen&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Psalms&quot;. 1811), which has passed through several editions.

<text>Thomas Kelly Cheyne, (18 September 18411915) was an English divine and biblical critic.

==Biography==
He was born in London and educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, London, and Oxford University. Subsequently, he studied German theological methods at Göttingen. He was ordained in 1864 and held a fellowship at Balliol College, Oxford, from 1868 to 1882. During the earlier part of this period he stood alone in the university as a teacher of the main conclusions of Old Testament criticism at that time. In 1881 he was presented to the rectory of Tendring, in Essex, and in 1884 he was made a member of the Old Testament revision company. He resigned the living of Tendring in 1885 on his appointment to be Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture, which carried with it a canonry at Rochester. In 1889 he delivered the Bampton lectures at Oxford. In 1908 he resigned his professorship.

In June 1901, he received an honorary doctorate of Divinity from the University of Glasgow, and in March 1902 he was awarded the degree Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Oxford.

In 1882 he married Frances Godfrey and she died in 1907. Cheyne wrote a glowing a review of the work published by Elizabeth Gibson in 1911. The review was in the progressive &quot;Christian Commonwealth.&quot; Gibson had published about twenty books of poetry or prose and she was an established writer&quot;.&quot; Their common interest fueled a whirlwind romance that resulted in their marriage in the Cornish village of Mawnan in Cornwall on 28 August 1911. Afterwards She joined Cheyne at his home in Oxford.

He consistently urged in his writings the necessity of a broad and comprehensive study of the Scriptures in the light of literary, historical and scientific considerations. His publications include commentaries on the &quot;Prophets and Hagiographa&quot;, as well as lectures and addresses on theological subjects. He was a joint editor of the &quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica&quot; (London, 1899-1903), a work embodying the more advanced conclusions of English biblical criticism. In the introduction to his &quot;Origin of the Psalter&quot; (London, 1891) he gave an account of his development as a critical scholar. His publications include translations, commentaries, and supplemental research.

He became a member of the Baháʼí Faith by 1912.
&quot;If there has been any Prophet in recent times&quot;, he wrote in his 1914 work &quot;The Reconciliation of Races and Religions&quot;, &quot;it is to Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh that we must go. Character is the final judge. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh was a man of the highest class – that of Prophets.&quot;

His second wife&#x27;s 1912 book &quot;The Voice of One Crying&quot; was &quot;arranged in cycles by T. K. C. i.e. Thomas Kelly Cheyne&quot;.

<doc id="180708" wikidata="Q244741" url="?curid=180708" title="Viceroy">
<text>A viceroy () is an official who reigns over a polity in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory.

The term derives from the Latin prefix &quot;vice-&quot;, meaning &quot;in the place of&quot; and the Anglo-Norman &quot;roy&quot; (Old French &quot;roi&quot;, &quot;roy&quot;), meaning &quot;king&quot;. This denotes the position as one who acts on behalf of a king or monarch. A viceroy&#x27;s territory may be called a viceroyalty, though this term is not always applied. The adjective form is viceregal, less often viceroyal. The term vicereine is sometimes used to indicate a female viceroy &quot;suo jure&quot;, although &quot;viceroy&quot; can serve as a gender-neutral term. Vicereine is more commonly used to indicate a viceroy&#x27;s wife, known as the viceregal consort.

The term has occasionally been applied to the governors-general of the Commonwealth realms, who are &quot;viceregal&quot; representatives of the monarch.

The position of a viceroy is by royal appointment rather than a noble rank. An individual viceroy often also held a separate noble title, such as Bernardo de Gálvez, 1st Viscount of Galveston, who was also Viceroy of New Spain.

==Spanish Empire==
The title was originally used by the Crown of Aragon, where, beginning in the 14th century, it referred to the Spanish governors of Sardinia and Corsica. After the unification, at the end of the 15th century, later kings of Spain came to appoint numerous viceroys to rule over various parts of the increasingly vast Spanish Empire in Europe, the Americas, and overseas elsewhere.

===In Spanish ruled Europe===
In Europe, until the 18th century, the Habsburg crown appointed viceroys of Aragon, Valencia, Catalonia, Navarre, Portugal during the brief period known as the Iberian Union, Sardinia, Sicily, and Naples. With the ascension of the House of Bourbon to the Spanish throne, the historic Aragonese viceroyalties were replaced by new captaincies general. At the end of War of the Spanish Succession, the Spanish monarchy was shorn of its Italian possessions. These Italian territories, however, continued to have viceroys under their new rulers for some time; Naples until 1734, Sicily until 1816 and Sardinia until 1848.

===In the Americas===
The Americas were incorporated into the Crown of Castile. With the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the institution of viceroys was adapted to govern the highly populated and wealthy regions of the north overseas: New Spain (Mexico and Philippines) and the south overseas: Peru and South America. The viceroys of these two areas had oversight over the other provinces, with most of the North American, Central American, Caribbean and East Indian areas supervised by the viceroy in Mexico City and the South American ones by the viceroy in Lima, (with the exception of most of today&#x27;s Venezuela, which was overseen by the high court, or Audiencia of Santo Domingo on the island of Hispaniola for most of the colonial period). These large administrative territories became known as &quot;viceroyalties&quot; (Spanish term: &quot;virreinatos&quot;). There were only two New World viceroyalties until the 18th century, when the new Bourbon dynasty established two additional viceroyalties to promote economic growth and new settlements on South America. New viceroyalties were created for New Granada in 1717 (capital, Bogotá) and the Río de la Plata in 1776 (capital, Buenos Aires).

The viceroyalties of the Spanish Americas and the Spanish East Indies were subdivided into smaller, autonomous units, the &quot;audiencias&quot; (tribunal with the authority to judge), and the captaincies general (military districts), which in most cases became the bases for the independent countries of modern Hispanic America. These units gathered the local provinces which could be governed by either a crown official, a &quot;corregidor&quot; (sometimes &quot;alcalde mayor&quot;) or by a &quot;cabildo&quot; or town council. Audiencias primarily functioned as superior judicial tribunals, but unlike their European counterparts, the New World audiencias were granted by law both administrative and legislative powers. Captaincies general were primarily military districts set up in areas with a risk of foreign or Indian attack, but the captains general were usually given political powers over the provinces under their command. Because the long distances to the viceregal capital would hamper effective communication, both audiencias and captains general were authorized to communicate directly with the crown through the Council of the Indies. The Bourbon Reforms introduced the new office of the intendant, which was appointed directly by the crown and had broad fiscal and administrative powers in political and military issues.

==Portuguese Empire==
===India===
From 1505 to 1896 Portuguese India – including, until 1752, all Portuguese possessions in the Indian Ocean, from southern Africa to Southeast Asia and Australasia – was governed alternatively by either a viceroy (Portuguese &quot;vice-rei&quot;) or governor and commission located in the capital of Goa. The government started seven years after the discovery of sea route to India by Vasco da Gama, in 1505, under the first viceroy, Francisco de Almeida (b.1450–d.1510). Initially, King Manuel I of Portugal tried to distribute power with three governors in different areas of jurisdiction: a government covering the area and possessions in East Africa, Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf, overseeing up to Cambay (Gujarat); a second one ruling the possessions in India (Hindustan) and Ceylon; and a third one from Malacca to the Far East. However, Governor Afonso de Albuquerque (1509–1515) centralized the post into a plenipotentiary office, which it remained after his tenure. The typical duration in office was usually three years, although powerful viceroys might extend their tenure; of the thirty-four governors of India in the 16th century, only six had longer mandates.

===Portugal===
During some periods of the Iberian Union, between 1580 and 1640, the king of Spain, who was also king of Portugal, appointed viceroys to govern Portugal itself, as the king had multiple realms throughout Europe and delegated his powers to various viceroys.

===Brazil===

After the end of the Iberian Union in 1640, the governors of Brazil that were members of the Portuguese high nobility started to use the title of Viceroy. Brazil became a permanent Viceroyalty in 1763, when the capital of the State of Brazil (&quot;Estado do Brasil&quot;) was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro.

==British Empire==

===India===

Following adoption of the Government of India Act 1858, which transferred control of India from the East India Company to the British Crown, the Governor-General as representing the Crown became known as the Viceroy. The designation &quot;Viceroy&quot;, although it was most frequently used in ordinary parlance, had no statutory authority, and was never employed by Parliament. Although the Proclamation of 1858 announcing the assumption of the government of India by the Crown referred to Lord Canning as &quot;first viceroy and governor-general&quot;, none of the warrants appointing his successors referred to them as &quot;viceroys&quot;, and the title, which was frequently used in warrants dealing with precedence and in public notifications, was basically one of ceremony used in connection with the state and social functions of the sovereign&#x27;s representative. The governor-general continued to be the sole representative of the Crown, and the government of India continued to be vested in the Governor-General-in-Council.

The viceroys reported directly to the secretary of state for India in London and were advised by the Council of India. They were largely unencumbered in the exercise of their authority and were among the most powerful men on earth in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, ruling over an entire subcontinent with a large military force at their disposal in the form of the Indian Army. Under the terms of the Government of India Act 1919, viceroys shared some limited aspects of their authority with the Central Legislative Assembly, one of the first steps in the establishment of Indian home rule. This process was accelerated by the Government of India Act 1935 and ultimately led to the independence of India and Pakistan as dominions in 1947. Both countries finally severed complete ties with Britain when they became republics – India as a secular republic in 1950 and Pakistan as an Islamic republic in 1956.

Alongside the Commander-in-Chief, India, the viceroy was the public face of the British presence in India, attending to many ceremonial functions as well as political affairs. As the representative of the emperors and empress of India, who were also the kings and queens of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the viceroy served as the grand master of the two principal orders of chivalry of British India: the Order of the Star of India and the Order of the Indian Empire.
During the office&#x27;s history, the governors-general of India were based in two cities: Calcutta until 1911 and New Delhi afterwards. Additionally, whilst Calcutta was the capital of India, the viceroys spent the summer months at Simla. The two historic residences of the viceroys still stand: the Viceroy&#x27;s House in New Delhi and Government House in Kolkata. They are used today as the official residences of the president of India and the governor of West Bengal, respectively. The portraits of the governors-general still hang in a room on the ground floor of the Presidential Palace, one of the last vestiges of both the viceroys and the British Raj.

Notable governors-general of India include Warren Hastings, Lord Cornwallis, Lord Curzon, The Earl of Minto, Lord Chelmsford, and Lord Mountbatten. Lord Mountbatten served as the last Viceroy of India, but continued on as the first governor-general of the Dominion of India.

===Ireland===
The lords lieutenant of Ireland were often referred to as &quot;viceroy&quot; after 1700 until 1922, even though the Kingdom of Ireland had been merged in 1801 into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Commonwealth realms==
The term has occasionally been applied to the governors-general of the Commonwealth realms, for example Gough Whitlam in 1973 told the Australian House of Representatives: &quot;The Governor-General is the viceroy of the Queen of Australia&quot;.

The Australia Act 1986 also provide that all royal powers in Australia, except the actual appointment of the governor-general and the governors, are exercisable by the viceregal representatives. The noun &quot;viceroy&quot; is rarely used, but the adjective &quot;viceregal&quot; is standard usage.

==Russian Empire==

Namestnik (, ) was an official position in the history of the Russian Empire. It can be translated as &quot;viceroy&quot;, &quot;deputy&quot;, &quot;lieutenant&quot; (in the broadest sense of the word) or &quot;in place &quot;. The term has two periods of usage, with different meanings.

*In the 8th–16th centuries, &quot;namestniks&quot; (more correctly &quot;knyaz namestniks&quot;, or &quot;knyaz deputies&quot;) were in charge of local administration. In particular, they ruled uyezds.
*In the 18th–20th centuries, a &quot;namestnik&quot; was a person in charge of namestnichestvo, with plenipotentiary powers. The latter has traditionally been translated as &quot;viceroyalty&quot; and &quot;namestnik&quot; as &quot;viceroy&quot; or &quot;vicegerent&quot; (or, as a common blunder, &quot;viceregent&quot;). For example, Mikhail Vorontsov was &quot;namestnik&quot; of Bessarabia (1823–44) and of the Caucasus (1844–1854). Sometimes the term is confused with &quot;governor general&quot; (генерал-губернатор). For example, during Vorontsov&#x27;s term of office in Bessarabia, seven governor-generals were in, and at the same time he held the office of governor general of Novorossiya. The following &quot;namestniks&quot; existed under the House of Romanov emperors of Russia:
**Congress Kingdom of Poland, while under the emperors of Russia as kings (styled &quot;tsar&quot;; 20 June 1815 – 5 November 1916), had only one viceroy, 9 December 1815 – 1 December 1830: Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich Romanov (1779–1831)
**Viceroyalty of the Caucasus – Transcaucasia (Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia; first under governors in Tbilisi 1802–1844) had viceroys of Transcaucasia.
**Viceroyalty of the Far East, lasted from July 30, 1903, to June 8, 1905, with Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev being the sole office holder.

The Tsar Paul I&#x27;s 1799 formation of the Russian-American Company obviated viceroys in the colonization of the northwestern New World.

==Other viceroyalties==
===French colonies===

New France, in present Canada, had a single governor:
* Jacques Cartier: 24 July 1534 – 15 January 1541

Thereafter it had lieutenants-general and viceroys:

* Jean François de la Rocquet, sieur de Roberval ( 1500 – 1560): 15 January 1541 – September 1543)
* &quot;interregnum&quot; September 1543 – 3 January 1578
* Troilus de Mesgouez, marquis de la Roche-Mesgouez (died February 1606): viceroy from 3 January 1578, lieutenant-general from 12 January 1598
* Jean de Biencourt, sieur de Poutrincourt, baron de St. Just (1557–1615): February 1606 – 1614

Next were a series of &quot;viceroys&quot; (resident in France) from 8 October 1611 to 1672. Later there were governors and governors-general.

The president of France retains, &quot;ex officio&quot;, the title of Co-Prince in the neighboring microstate of Andorra (a post previously occupied by the king of France) and continues to send a personal representative, a &quot;de facto&quot; viceroy to rule on their behalf (as does their co-ruler, the Bishop of Urgell).

The French position of &quot;adjunct département director, delegate for the sea and coast of the Atlantic Pyrenees and Landes&quot; carries the title of &quot;viceroy of Pheasant Island&quot;.
Pheasant Island is a French-Spanish condominium on the river Bidasoa.

===Italian colonies===

In Italian &quot;viceré&quot;: The highest colonial representatives in the &quot;federation&quot; of Italian East Africa (six provinces, each under a governor; together Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somaliland) were no longer styled &quot;high commissioner&quot;, but &quot;viceroy and governor-general&quot; from 5 May 1936, when Italian forces occupied the Ethiopian Empire (today Ethiopia), until 27 November 1941, when the last Italian administrator surrendered to the Allies.

On 7 April 1939, Italy invaded the Albanian Kingdom (today Albania). As viceré of Albania of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy were the Marchese Francesco Jacomoni di San Savino and after his departure General Alberto Pariani.

===Ban of Bosnia===
Ban Borić was the first ruler and viceroy of Bosnia, appointed by Géza II of Hungary by 1154. His war affairs are documented as he fought several notable battles. He also maintained ties with knights Templar and donated lands in Bosnia and Slavonia to their order. His own biological brother Dominic was on record as a Knight Templar.

Due to his vast powers over Bosnian politics and essential veto powers, the modern-day position of the high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina has been compared to that of a viceroy.

===Ban of Croatia===

From the earliest medieval period in the Kingdom of Croatia, the position of viceroy was held by Ban of Croatia who acted as king&#x27;s representative in Croatian lands and supreme commander of Croatian army. In the 18th century, Croatian bans eventually become chief government officials in Croatia. They were at the head of Ban&#x27;s Government, effectively the first prime ministers of Croatia. The last ban held his position until 1941 and the collapse of Yugoslavia in World War II.

==Ancient antecedents==
An equivalent office, called the Exarch, was created in the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire towards the end of the sixth century for governors of important areas too far from the imperial capital of Constantinople to receive regular instruction or reinforcement. The chosen governors of these provinces were empowered to act in place of the monarch (hence &quot;ex-&quot; &quot;outside&quot;, &quot;arch&quot; &quot;ruler&quot;) with more discretion and autonomy than was granted other categories of governor. This was an extraordinary break from the centralized traditions of the Roman Empire and was an early example of the principle of viceroyalty.

==Non-Western counterparts==
As with many princely and administrative titles, viceroy is often used, generally unofficially, to render somewhat equivalent titles and offices in non-western cultures.

===Africa===
In cultures all over the continent of Africa, the role of viceroy has been subsumed into a hereditary noble as opposed to strictly administrative position. In the Arabo-Berber north, for example, the title of Khalifa is often used by individuals who derive their authority to rule from someone else in much the same way as a viceroy would. Elsewhere, subordinate &quot;inkosis&quot; under the rule of a paramount chief like the King of the Zulu Nation of Southern Africa or subordinate &quot;baales&quot; in the realms of the reigning obas of West African Yorubaland continue to occupy statutorily recognized positions in the contemporary countries of South Africa and Nigeria as the customary representatives of their respective principals in the various areas that are under their immediate control.

=== Indian empires ===

==== Magadha Empire ====
The viceroy in the Magadha Empire was called Uparaja (lit. vice king).

==== Mughal Empire ====
The Mughal Empire had a system of administration which involved both official governors appointed from the capital, and local feudal lords (zamindars). Subahdars were the former, and can be seen as equivalents of viceroys, governing the provinces (subahs) by appointment from the capital. Mansabdars were military governors who were also appointed to provincial government, but they were appointed for military rather than civilian government.

===Ottoman Empire===
The Khedive of Egypt, especially during the reign of Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805–1848). This officer established an almost autonomous regime in Egypt, which officially still was under Ottoman rule. Although Mehemet Ali/Muhammad Ali used different symbols to mark his independence from the Sublime Porte, he never openly declared himself independent. Adopting the title of viceroy was yet another way to walk the thin line between challenging the Sultan&#x27;s power explicitly and respecting his jurisdiction. Muhammad Ali Pasha&#x27;s grandson, Ismail Pasha, subsequently received the title of Khedive which was almost an equivalent to viceroy.

Other titles, such as Sharif (as in the Sharifate of Mecca), or Khan (as in the Crimean Khanate or the Khanate of Kazan), denoted hereditary rulers of Ottoman vassal states, under the Sultan&#x27;s titles of Caliph and Great Khan, respectively.

Titles such as pasha, beylerbey, bey, and agha denote officials who were, at least nominally, appointed to their positions by the Sublime Porte rather than hereditary privilege. Pashas and beylerbeys were appointed to govern provinces called eyalets, until the promulgation of the Vilayet Law in 1867 ended the eyalet system, replacing it with more centrally-controlled vilayets. the beylerbey of the Rumelia Eyalet was the only provincial governor entitled to a seat in the Imperial Council, but only when a matter fell within his jurisdiction.

===Vietnamese Empire===
The post of Tổng Trấn (&quot;governor of all military provinces&quot;) was a political post in the early period of the Vietnamese Nguyễn dynasty (1802–1830). From 1802, under the reign of emperor Gia Long, there were two &quot;Tổng Trấn&quot; who administered Vietnam&#x27;s northern part named Bắc thành with administrative center in Hanoi and the southern part Gia Định thành with administrative center in Gia Định, while Nguyen emperors ruled only the central region Kinh Kỳ from capital Phú Xuân. &quot;Tổng Trấn&quot; is sometimes translated to English as viceroy. In 1830, emperor Minh Mạng abolished the post in order to increase the imperial direct ruling power in all over Vietnam.

===Chinese empires===

During the Han, Ming and Qing dynasties, there existed positions of viceroys having control over various provinces (e.g., Liangguang = Guangdong and Guangxi, Huguang = Hubei and Hunan).

=== Siam ===

In Siam before 1885, the title was used for the heir-apparent or heir presumptive (Thai: กรมพระราชวังบวรสถานมงคล) The title was abolished and replaced with that of the Crown Prince of Siam.

<text>Lantau Island (also Lantao Island, Lan Tao or Lan Tau) is the largest island in Hong Kong, located west of Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, and is part of the New Territories. Administratively, most of Lantau Island is part of the Islands District of Hong Kong. A small northeastern portion of the island is located in the Tsuen Wan District.

Originally an island with fishing villages, it has been developed since the late 20th century with the construction of Tung Chung New Town on its north-western coast and the completion of several major infrastructure projects, including Lantau Link (1997), Hong Kong International Airport (1998), Hong Kong Disneyland (2005), and Ngong Ping 360 (2006). 
==Geography==

With a land mass of , Lantau is the largest island in Hong Kong, almost twice the size of Hong Kong Island. Lantau Island primarily consists of mountainous terrain. Lantau Peak () is the highest point of the island. It is the second highest in Hong Kong, after Tai Mo Shan, and is almost twice the height of Victoria Peak. Other mountains include Sunset Peak (Tai Tung Shan) at , Lin Fa Shan at , Nei Lak Shan at and Yi Tung Shan at .

Lantau Island is often referred to as &quot;the lungs of Hong Kong&quot;, because of its abundance of indigenous forest and relative scarcity of high-rise residential developments which characterise Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. The largest country park of Hong Kong, Lantau South Country Park is located on the island, which hosts two other parks, namely Lantau North Country Park and its extension. These parks cover slightly more than half of the area of Lantau Island.

Shek Pik Reservoir is the third largest freshwater reservoir in Hong Kong. Completed in 1963, it covers an area of and has a capacity of .

Fan Lau Kok at the end of Fan Lau Peninsula is the southwest end of the territory of Hong Kong. The small island of Peaked Hill, off Tsin Yue Wan (), marks the westernmost point on the land of Hong Kong territories.

==Population==
Lantau Island has relatively low population density. Settlements are scattered throughout the island and each has its own distinctive characteristics. The completion of the Hong Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok in 1998 has led to economic development in north-western Lantau; the once quiet village of Tung Chung became a new town and is now home to over 45,000 people located in 30 to 50 storey high-rise housing estates and condominiums located near the airport. The neighbouring Yat Tung Estate houses 37,273 people, primarily in public housing. Over the next few years, the population of the North Lantau New Town is expected to increase to a target population of over 200,000 across of reclaimed land stretching from Tung Chung to Tai Ho Wan.

===Discovery Bay===
Discovery Bay is a privately owned residential development located on the south-eastern coast of Lantau. The district has a population of 20,271 residents from over 30 different countries, giving it a reputation as an expatriate enclave.
===Villages===
Other settlements include Mui Wo, Tai O, Tong Fuk, Sha Lo Wan villages, Pui O villages, Luk Keng Village, Nim Shue Wan Village, Pak Mong, San Shek Wan and The Sea Ranch.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Lantau Island&quot; is based on the old local name of &quot;Lantau Peak&quot;, (). Its Chinese name, , is sometimes romanized as Tai Yu Shan. The island has been historically known as Tai Hai Shan (), Tai Kai Shan (), Tai Yi Shan (), and Tuen Mun Island ().

==History==
Early human artifacts have been discovered on the island. These include rock carvings at Shek Pik, which are thought to date back to the Bronze Age, and a stone circle at Fan Lau which is probably from the Neolithic Age. Both sites are located on the southwestern coast of the island.

The island was often shown in navigation maps because of its proximity to a major sea route in South China.

In 1276, the Southern Song dynasty court fled to Guangdong by boat to escape Mongol invaders, leaving Emperor Gong of Song behind. The resistance centred on two young princes, Emperor Gong&#x27;s brothers. The older boy Zhao Shi, was declared emperor at the age of nine, ascending the throne as Emperor Duanzong of Song. In 1277, the imperial court sought refuge first in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island (then known as Gangzhou (), and later in today&#x27;s Kowloon City. The older brother became ill, died, and was succeeded by the younger brother Zhao Bing (Emperor Bing of Song) at the age of seven. He died in 1279, and the Song dynasty ended. These emperors are also believed to have held court in the Tung Chung valley, which takes its name from a local hero who gave up his life for the emperor.

Lantau Island and Tamão, Tuen Mun were among the first European trading settlements in the Pearl River area, established by Portuguese traders in the 1510s. The Portuguese abandoned these settlements around 1517, following their defeat by Chinese troops in the Battle of Tunmen and Battle of Sincouwaan. Lantau was visited in 1607 by one of the early Dutch East India Company (VOC) fleet commanders Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge who describes his visit to the local &quot;mandarin&quot;. A drawing of this official&#x27;s compound was published in the 1648 edition of Matelieff&#x27;s travelogue. Much later the island became an important trading post for the British, long before they became interested in Hong Kong Island.

There were nine settlements on the island in the early 16th century: Kai Kung Tau (), Shek Pik, Tai O, Sha Lo Wan, Tung Sai Chung (, now known as Tung Chung), Tai Ho Shan (, now known as Lantau Peak), Mui Wo, Lo Pui O (now known as Pui O) and Tong Fuk. The island was evacuated for about a decade, following the orders imposed by the Great Clearance, and people were allowed to return to settle on the island in 1669. Five villages were subsequently resettled: Tai O, Tung Sai Chung, Lo Pui O, Shek Pik and Mui Wo.

Salt was illegally produced on Lantau Island. This was discovered by the Chinese rulers during the 16th century, and the local warlord put many islanders to death as a result.


Lantau Island was surveyed by a French fleet by Alexandre Dalmypre around the Delta of the Pearl River in 1760. Lantau Island was already clearly visible on Western maps around the Delta, on the most important waterway to Canton. 

Lantau was once a base for pirates and smugglers, and was one of the haunts of Cheung Po Tsai in the 19th century. Galena, a mineral consisting of lead and silver, was mined at Mui Wo until the 19th century.

Lantau Island was a major site of resistance against the Japanese during the Second World War. The resistance movement made use of the island&#x27;s wooded areas and deep valleys in order to organise ambushes and move supplies. The resistance movement persevered through the war until the end of the Japanese occupation in 1945.

In 2000, Lantau Island acted as an important base for the Fiber-Optic Link Around the Globe project and the Asia-Pacific Cable Network which acts as an Internet bridge to the rest of the world.

==Tourist attractions==


===Ngong Ping===
The Ngong Ping Plateau features the Po Lin Monastery and its vegetarian restaurant, as well as the -high bronze Tian Tan Buddha (or &quot;Giant Buddha&quot;) statue, once the world&#x27;s largest seated outdoor bronze Buddha statue. Walkers can ascend from Tung Chung to the monastery in two hours. Visitors can also take a 25-minute ride on a Ngong Ping 360 cable car from Tung Chung to the Ngong Ping Plateau. Ngong Ping 360 is a tourism experience which combines a cable car journey with a cultural themed village and easy access to the Tian Tan Buddha Statue.

===Tai O===
Tai O is a fishing village located in the northwest of Lantau Island which is more than three centuries old. Tourists visit Tai O for its several hundred stilt houses (&quot;pang uk&quot;), though some of those houses have been repaired after a fire in July 2000 and others from damage caused by super typhoons and related storm surges in subsequent years. While Tai O is in the process of being revitalised with a series of measures such as new signages and two bridges to facilitate movement of visitors, Tai O retains most of its historical setting such as waterways, stilt houses and fishing boats and is famous for its fishing village scenery in a mountainous setting. Traditional Chinese food like salted fish and locally produced shrimp paste can be found there.

===Tung Chung===
Tung Chung Fort was built in 1817 to thwart the opium trade and defend the coast from pirates. There are 6 old cannons and the enclosures are made of granite. During World War II, the Japanese army occupied the fort. In 1979, it was listed as one of the historical monuments of Hong Kong and was refurbished in 1988. The ruins of the Tung Chung Battery, also a historical monument, are located nearby.

===Trappist Haven Monastery===
The Trappist Haven Monastery at Tai Shui Hang, home to a number of Roman Catholic monks, sits on the east coast of Lantau Island, approximately halfway between the towns of Mui Wo and Discovery Bay. The Lantau Trappist congregation was established in Beijing in the 19th century.

===Hong Kong Disneyland===
Hong Kong Disneyland lies on the northeastern part of the island, approximately two kilometres from Discovery Bay. It opened on 12 September 2005 on a massive land reclamation project in Penny&#x27;s Bay. The US$1.8 billion project includes a Disney theme park, three hotels, and retail, dining and entertainment facilities stretching over 1.26 km2 (310 acres). The project also has its own rail network linking from Sunny Bay MTR station in Yam O.

===Nature===
Over 50% of Lantau consists of national parks, including a large number of well-marked trails. The best known of these is the 70 kilometre, 12 section Lantau Trail composed of beauty of natural stone steps and the dense woodland along a 3-kilometer stretch. Section 11 of the Lantau Trail starts just across the Tung Chung Road, which is not far from Ngong Ping 360. This section of the trail will reach South Lantau Road at Pui O and hikers can appreciate the beauty of natural stone steps and the dense woodland along the 3 km journey. The national parks feature campsites and youth hostels. Lantau&#x27;s longest beach is Cheung Sha and one of its most famous hikes is to Sunset Peak (Tai Tung Shan ), the third highest peak in Hong Kong.

==Flora and fauna==
Chinese white dolphins, often called &quot;pink dolphins&quot;, can be seen off the coast of Lantau. , a marine park, the Southwest Lantau Marine Park, is being planned to protect them. In the southern parts of Lantau Island, local residents rely on local oyster fields, lemon and tangerine trees to make preserved fruits. There are also feral water buffalos living in Mui Wo and Pui O. The entire southern part of Lantau Island has a well-established ecosystem.

==Prisons==
There are six prisons on Lantau Island: Chi Ma Wan Correctional Institution, Chi Sun Correctional Institution (formerly the Chi Ma Wan Drug Addiction Treatment Centre), Ma Mo Ping Prison, Tong Fuk centre west of Tong Fuk, Sha Tsui Detention Centre and the maximum security Shek Pik Prison, both located near Shek Pik Reservoir. Plans were put forward by the government to build an enormous &quot;Super Prison&quot; on the sparsely populated nearby island of Hei Ling Chau, to be connected by a bridge to Mui Wo. However, this plan was indefinitely shelved after organised resistance by local residents.

==Transport==

===Airport===
Hong Kong International Airport (HKG/HKIA) is located on Chek Lap Kok island and started service in July 1998. It is located off the north coast of Lantau, near the new town of Tung Chung and is connected to urban areas by the Lantau Link, which is composed of the Kap Shui Mun Bridge, the Ma Wan Viaduct, and the Tsing Ma Bridge.

===Rail===
The airport also has a metro rail connection to the rest of Hong Kong via the MTR&#x27;s Airport Express, along with several bus routes. This was built in the 1990s, whilst the new airport was being built. Using the Airport Express, the journey time between Central, Hong Kong&#x27;s business district, and Chep Lap Kok airport is 23 minutes (though the Airport Express does not make any stops in Lantau proper). In addition, one can reach Tung Chung by train on the Tung Chung line of the MTR, and the Disneyland Resort line branches off of the Tung Chung line at Sunny Bay station, serving the Disneyland Resort station at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.

===Water transport===
Tourists can get to Lantau using ferry services provided by Sun Ferry. This ferry service is available between Mui Wo and Central with a transportation time of about 30 to 50 minutes, depending on the vessel. A 24-hour ferry service operated by HKR International Limited connects Pier 3 in Central to Discovery Bay with a transportation time of 25 minutes.

There are also several smaller inter-island ferry services linking neighbouring islands and the mainland. These ferries, known locally as kai-tos (pronounced &quot;Guy-doe&quot;) provide scheduled services. These include Nim Shue Wan; adjacent to Discovery Bay, and Peng Chau Island with a stopover at the Trappist Haven Monastery on Lantau, Nim Shue Wan and Mui Wo on Lantau. Other Kai-To and ferry services link Peng Chau, Mui Wo Lantau, Chi Ma Wan Lantau, and Cheung Chau Island, and another links Tuen Mun, Tung Chung, Sha Lo Wan, and Tai O.

Travel between islands is also possible by &quot;walla walla&quot;, a traditional water taxi, typically from nearby Cheung Chau Island.

===Road transport===
Residents and tourists can travel within Lantau Island either by taxi or bus. The New Lantao Bus provides major bus services within the island, where one can get to Tai O and Po Lin Monastery from Mui Wo pier. Some of the roads and bridges were built in the 1990s, whilst the new airport was being built.

In Hong Kong, there are three types of taxis. Red taxis serve the urban areas, green taxis serve the New Territories while taxis on Lantau Island are blue in colour. All three taxi services can ply for passengers at the Airport and Tung Chung, but only the blue taxis can take passengers to other locations on Lantau Island. There are 75 blue taxis serving the Lantau Island area. (25 added in 2016)

The southern part of Lantau Island are the most dangerous roads in all of Hong Kong due to the narrow and hilly roads that are inaccessible to buses with lack of safety barriers. From February 2016, owners of private vehicles that wish to travel to these roads must obtain a temporary permit. However, due to the dangerous roads, the permit only lasts from 8am-7pm, only has 25 allotments, and only available on weekdays, while residents of these areas must obtain a permanent permit.

===Cable car===
The Ngong Ping 360, a gondola lift, is located on Lantau and is operated by the MTR. Opened on 18 September 2006, this provides a 5.7 km 20-minute gondola cableway journey between Tung Chung and Ngong Ping.

==Education==
Most of Lantau Island is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 98, which contains multiple aided schools on Lantau Island, including two in Tung Chung; no government primary schools are in this net.

Northeast Lantau Island is in POA School Net 62, which includes schools in Tsuen Wan and areas nearby. The net includes multiple aided schools and one government school, Hoi Pa Street Government Primary School.

Discovery Bay, Nim Shue Wan, and Tai Pak Wan are in POA School Net 99, which contains two aided schools: SKH Wei Lun Primary School in Discovery Bay and Holy Family School in Peng Chau; no government primary schools are in this net.

Discovery Bay International School and Discovery College are private co-educational schools in Discovery Bay.

==Proposed development==
The Lantau Development Advisory Committee (LanDAC) was formed within the Development Bureau to advise the government on Lantau Island&#x27;s development potential. The committee first met in 2014. Save Lantau Alliance, an activist group opposed to large-scale development of the island, called on the council members to disclose their conflicts of interest. Numerous members hold business interests on the island, including 10 non-official members who subsequently declared interests ranging from running the AsiaWorld–Expo events centre (Allen Ha) to holding directorships at major developers with land holdings in and around Lantau (Andrew Lam of Shui On Land, Randy Yu of Sino Land, Ivan Chu of Swire).

Following the first meeting of the LanDAC, development chief Paul Chan Mo-po told the press that the government would not rule out developing country parks. LanDAC member Wu Chi-wai stated publicly that the committee was ignoring a 2007 concept plan for Lantau, developed with public consultation, and spoke against developing the country parks. Lam Chiu Ying, conservationist and former head of the Hong Kong Observatory, responded that Chan&#x27;s remarks were &quot;unacceptable&quot; and stated, &quot;while other cities are aiming for an increase (in greenery), we are doing the opposite. It&#x27;s ridiculous.&quot;

The committee&#x27;s first report, a 33-page document entitled &quot;Space for All&quot;, was discreetly released online on 10 January 2016. Only a Chinese version of the full report was released, with an English synopsis provided. The report recommends developing Lantau Island into a &quot;metropolis&quot; housing between 700,000 and 1,000,000 people, a new commercial hub, and a centre of tourism. It proposes large-scale land reclamation on the north shore of the island, and a series of highway and railway connections between Kennedy Town on Hong Kong Island, passing through Hei Ling Chau and a series of artificial islands, to land at Mui Wo. Leung Chun-ying praised the report for having &quot;fully considered the current situations of various districts in Lantau, including the conservation needs and the development potential&quot; while it was denounced by green groups for being environmentally destructive.

On 13 January 2016, during his annual policy address, CY Leung announced that a dedicated Lantau Development Office would be set up as soon as possible to take forward development on the island. The Lantau Tomorrow Vision was announced in 2018, with the intention of creating additional islands on the east coast of Lantau.

<text>Karl Rudolf Hagenbach (March 4, 1801 – June 7, 1874) was a Swiss church theologian and historian. He was particularly interested in the Protestant Reformation and its figures.

==Life==

Hagenbach was born at Basel, where his father was a practising physician, and a professor of anatomy and botany in the university. His preliminary education was at a Pestalozzian school, and afterwards at the gymnasium, whence in due course he passed to the newly reorganized local university. He early devoted himself to theological studies and the service of the church, while at the same time cherishing and developing broad &quot;humanistic&quot; tendencies which found expression in many ways and especially in an enthusiastic admiration for the writings of Herder.

The years 1820–1823 were spent first at Bonn, where G. C. F. Lucke (1791–1855) exerted a powerful influence on his thought, and afterwards at Berlin, where Schleiermacher and Neander became his masters. Returning in 1823 to Basel, where W. M. L. de Wette had recently been appointed to a theological chair, he distinguished himself greatly by his trial dissertation, &quot;Observationes historico-hermeneuticae circa Origenis methodum interpretendae sacrae Scripturae&quot;; in 1824 he became professor extraordinarius, and in 1829 professor ordinarius of theology.

Apart from his academic labours in connection with the history of dogma and of the church, he lived a life of great and varied usefulness as a theologian, a preacher and a citizen; and at his jubilee in 1873, not only the university and town of Basel but also the various churches of Switzerland united to do him honour. He died at Basel on 7 June 1874.

==Works==
Hagenbach was a voluminous author, distinguished as a writer on church history. Though neither so learned and condensed as the contributions of Gieseler, nor so original and profound as those of Neander, his lectures are clear, attractive and free from narrow sectarian prejudice. In dogmatics, while avowedly a champion of the mediation theology (), based upon the fundamental conceptions of Herder and Schleiermacher, he was much less revolutionary than were many others of his school. He sought to maintain the old confessional documents, and to make the objective prevail over the purely subjective manner of viewing theological questions. But he himself was aware that in the endeavour to do so he was not always successful, and that his delineations of Christian dogma often betrayed a vacillating and uncertain hand.

His works include:

*&quot;Tabellarische Übersicht der Dogmengeschichte&quot; (1828).
*&quot;Encyclopädie u. Methodologie der theol. Wissenschaften&quot; (1833/1889; English trans., 1884/1891).

*&quot;Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte&quot; (1840–1841, 5th edition, 1867; English transl., vol. 1, 1850, vol. 2, 1861).

*&quot;Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der alten Kirche&quot; (1853–1855).
*&quot;Vorlesungen über die Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters&quot; (1860–1861).

*&quot;Geschichte der theologische Schule Basels&quot; (1860).
*&quot;Predigten&quot; (&quot;Sermons,&quot; Basel, 1858–1875).
*&quot;Luther und seine Zeit&quot;, a book of poems (&quot;Luther and his times,&quot; 1838)
*&quot;Gedichte&quot; (&quot;Poems,&quot; Basel, 1846).

The lectures on church history under the general title &quot;Vorlesungen über die Kirchengeschichte von der ältesten Zeit bis zum 19ten Jahrhundert&quot; were reissued in seven volumes (1868–1872; vol. 1; vol. 2;vol. 3; vol. 4; vol. 5; vol. 6; vol. 7).

He edited the &quot;Kirchenblatt für die reformierte Schweiz&quot; (from 1845 to 1868), and also a series of biographies of the reformers of the Reformed Church, with selections from their writings (&quot;Leben und Schriften der Väter und Begründer der reformierten Kirche&quot;, Elberfeld, 1857–1862, 10 volumes), to which he contributed the lives of Oecolampadius and Oswald Myconius (1859, see above).

<text>James Wolfe (2 January 1727 – 13 September 1759) was a British Army officer known for his training reforms and, as a major general, remembered chiefly for his victory in 1759 over the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Quebec. 

The son of a distinguished general, Edward Wolfe, he received his first commission at a young age and saw extensive service in Europe during the War of the Austrian Succession. His service in Flanders and in Scotland, where he took part in the suppression of the Jacobite Rebellion, brought him to the attention of his superiors. The advancement of his career was halted by the Peace Treaty of 1748 and he spent much of the next eight years on garrison duty in the Scottish Highlands. Already a brigade major at the age of 18, he was a lieutenant-colonel by 23.

The outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756 offered Wolfe fresh opportunities for advancement. His part in the aborted raid on Rochefort in 1757 led William Pitt to appoint him second-in-command of an expedition to capture the Fortress of Louisbourg. Following the success of the siege of Louisbourg he was made commander of a force which sailed up the Saint Lawrence River to capture Quebec City. After a long siege, Wolfe defeated a French force under the Marquis de Montcalm, allowing British forces to capture the city. Wolfe was killed at the height of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham due to injuries from three musket balls. The next day, Montcalm died as well.

Wolfe&#x27;s part in the taking of Quebec in 1759 earned him lasting fame, and he became an icon of Britain&#x27;s victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War and subsequent territorial expansion. He was depicted in the painting &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot;, which became famous around the world. Wolfe was posthumously dubbed &quot;The Hero of Quebec&quot;, &quot;The Conqueror of Quebec&quot;, and also &quot;The Conqueror of Canada&quot;, since the capture of Quebec led directly to the capture of Montreal, ending French control of the colony.

==Early life==
James Wolfe was born at the local vicarage on 2 January 1727 (New Style or 22 December 1726 Old Style) at Westerham, Kent, the older of two sons of Colonel (later Lieutenant General) Edward Wolfe, a veteran soldier whose family was of Anglo-Irish origin, and the former Henrietta Thompson. His uncle was Edward Thompson MP, a distinguished politician. Wolfe&#x27;s childhood home in Westerham, known in his lifetime as Spiers, has been preserved in his memory by the National Trust under the name Quebec House. Wolfe&#x27;s family were long settled in Ireland and he regularly corresponded with his uncle Major Walter Wolfe in Dublin. Stephen Woulfe, the distinguished Irish politician and judge of the next century, was from the Limerick branch of the same family; his father was James Wolfe&#x27;s third cousin.

The Wolfes were close to the Warde family, who lived at Squerryes Court in Westerham. Wolfe&#x27;s boyhood friend George Warde achieved fame as Commander-in-Chief in Ireland.

Around 1738, the family moved to Greenwich, in north-west Kent. From his earliest years, Wolfe was destined for a military career, entering his father&#x27;s 1st Marine regiment as a volunteer at the age of thirteen.

Illness prevented him from taking part in a large expedition against Spanish-held Cartagena in 1740, and his father sent him home a few months later. He missed what proved to be a disaster for the British forces at the Siege of Cartagena during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, in which most of the expedition died from disease.

==War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748)==

===European War===

In 1740 the War of the Austrian Succession broke out in Europe. Although initially Britain did not actively intervene, the presence of a sizable French army near the border of the Austrian Netherlands compelled the British to send an expedition to help defend the territory of their Austrian ally in 1742. James Wolfe was given his first commission as a second lieutenant in his father&#x27;s regiment of Marines in 1741. 

Early in the following year he transferred to the 12th Regiment of Foot, a British Army infantry regiment, and set sail for Flanders some months later where the British took up position in Ghent. Here, Wolfe was promoted to Lieutenant and made adjutant of his battalion. His first year on the continent was a frustrating one as, despite rumours of a British attack on Dunkirk, they remained inactive in Flanders.

In 1743, he was joined by his younger brother, Edward, who had received a commission in the same regiment. That year the Wolfe brothers took part in an offensive launched by the British. Instead of moving southwards as expected, the British and their allies instead thrust eastwards into Southern Germany where they faced a large French army. The army came under the personal command of George II but in June he appeared to have made a catastrophic mistake which left the Allies trapped against the river Main and surrounded by enemy forces in &quot;a mousetrap&quot;.

Rather than contemplate surrender, George tried to rectify the situation by launching an attack on the French positions near the village of Dettingen. Wolfe&#x27;s regiment was involved in heavy fighting, as the two sides exchanged volley after volley of musket fire. His regiment had suffered the highest casualties of any of the British infantry battalions, and Wolfe had his horse shot from underneath him. Despite three French attacks the Allies managed to drive off the enemy, who fled through the village of Dettingen which was then occupied by the Allies. However, George failed to adequately pursue the retreating enemy, allowing them to escape. In spite of this the Allies had successfully thwarted the French move into Germany, safeguarding the independence of Hanover.

Wolfe&#x27;s regiment at Battle of Dettingen came to the attention of the Duke of Cumberland who had been close to him during the battle when they came under enemy fire. A year later, he became a captain of the 45th Regiment of Foot. After the success of Dettingen, the 1744 campaign was another frustration as the Allies forces now led by George Wade failed to complete their objective of capturing Lille, fought no major battles, and returned to winter quarters at Ghent without anything to show for their efforts. Wolfe was left devastated when his brother Edward died, probably of consumption, that autumn.

Wolfe&#x27;s regiment was left behind to garrison Ghent, which meant they missed the Allied defeat at the Battle of Fontenoy in May 1745 during which Wolfe&#x27;s former regiment suffered extremely heavy casualties. Wolfe&#x27;s regiment was then summoned to reinforce the main Allied army, now under the command of the Duke of Cumberland. Shortly after they had departed Ghent, the town was suddenly attacked by the French who captured it and its garrison. Having narrowly avoided becoming a French prisoner, Wolfe was now made a brigade major.

===Jacobite rising===
In July 1745, Charles Stuart landed in Scotland in an attempt to regain the British throne for his father, the exiled James Stuart. In the initial stages of the 1745 Rising, the Jacobites captured Edinburgh and defeated government forces at the Battle of Prestonpans in September. This resulted in the recall of Cumberland, commander of the British army in Flanders and 12,000 troops, including Wolfe&#x27;s regiment.

On 8 November, the Jacobite army crossed into England, avoiding government forces at Newcastle by taking the western route via Carlisle. They reached Derby before turning back on 6 December, largely due to lack of English support, and successfully returned to Scotland. Wolfe was aide-de-camp to Henry Hawley, commander at Falkirk and fought at Culloden in April under Cumberland.

A famous anecdote claims Wolfe refused an order to shoot a wounded Highland officer after Culloden, the person giving the order variously named as Cumberland or Hawley. There is certainly evidence to confirm Jacobite wounded were killed and Hawley was one of those who gave orders to that effect. However, the claim that he refused such orders cannot be confirmed, while author and historian John Prebble refers to the killings as &#x27;symptomatic of the army&#x27;s general mood and behaviour.&#x27; This included Wolfe; as leader of punitive raids after the battle, he wrote to a colleague that &#x27;as few Highlanders are made prisoner as possible.&#x27;

===Return to the Continent===

In January 1747 Wolfe returned to the Continent and the War of the Austrian Succession, serving under Sir John Mordaunt. The French had taken advantage of the absence of Cumberland&#x27;s British troops and had made advances in the Austrian Netherlands including the capture of Brussels.

The major French objective in 1747 was to capture Maastricht considered the gateway to the Dutch Republic. Wolfe was part of Cumberland&#x27;s army, which marched to protect the city from the advancing French force under Marshal Saxe. On 2 July Wolfe participated in the Battle of Lauffeld, he was very badly wounded and received an official commendation for services to Britain. Lauffeld was the largest battle in terms of numbers in which Wolfe fought, with the combined strength of both armies totalling over 140,000. Following their narrow victory at Lauffeld, the French captured Maastricht and seized the strategic fortress at Bergen-op-Zoom. Both sides remained poised for further offensives, but an armistice halted the fighting.

In 1748, aged 21 and with service in seven campaigns, Wolfe returned to Britain following the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle which ended the war. Under the treaty, Britain and France had agreed to exchange all captured territory and the Austrian Netherlands were returned to Austrian control.

==Peacetime service (1748–1756)==

Once home, he was posted to Scotland and garrison duty, and a year later was made a major, in which rank he assumed command of the 20th Regiment, stationed at Stirling. In 1750, Wolfe was confirmed as Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment.

Over the eight years that Wolfe was in Scotland, he wrote military pamphlets and became proficient in French as a result of several trips to Paris. Despite struggling with bouts of ill health suspected to be tuberculosis, he made an effort to keep himself mentally fit by teaching himself Latin and mathematics. When able to, Wolfe trained his body, especially pushing himself to improve his swordsmanship.

In 1752, Wolfe was granted extended leave. Departing from Scotland, he first went to Ireland and stayed with his uncle in Dublin. He visited Belfast and toured the site of the Battle of the Boyne. After a brief stop at his parents&#x27; house in Greenwich, he received permission from the Duke of Cumberland to go abroad, and crossed the English Channel to France. In Paris, he was frequently entertained by the British Ambassador, Earl of Albemarle, with whom he had served in Scotland in 1746. In addition to this, Albemarle arranged an audience for Wolfe with Louis XV. He submitted an application to extend his leave so that he could witness a major military exercise conducted by the French army, but he was instead urgently ordered home. He rejoined his regiment in Glasgow. By 1754 Britain&#x27;s declining relationship with France made a war imminent, and fighting broke out in North America between the two sides.

Desertion, especially in the face of the enemy had always officially been regarded as a capital offence. Wolfe laid particular stress on the importance of the death penalty and in 1755, he ordered that any soldier who broke ranks (&quot;offers to quit his rank or offers to flag&quot;) should be instantly put to death by an officer or a sergeant.

==Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63)==

In 1756, with the outbreak of open hostilities with France, Wolfe was promoted to Colonel. He was stationed in Canterbury, where his regiment had been posted to guard his home county of Kent against a French invasion threat. He was extremely dispirited by news of the loss of Minorca in June 1756, lamenting what he saw as the lack of professionalism amongst the British forces. Despite a widespread belief that French landing was imminent, Wolfe thought that it was unlikely his men would be called into action. In spite of this, he trained them diligently and issued fighting instructions to his troops.

As the threat of invasion decreased, the regiment was marched to Wiltshire. Despite the initial setbacks of the war in Europe and North America, the British were now expected to take the offensive and Wolfe anticipated playing a major role in future operations. However, his health was beginning to decline, which led to suspicions that he was suffering, as his younger brother (Edward Wolfe 1728–1744) had, from consumption. Many of his letters to his parents began to assume a slightly fatalistic note in which he talked of the likelihood of an early death.

===Rochefort===

In 1757, Wolfe participated in the British amphibious assault on Rochefort, a seaport on the French Atlantic coast. A major naval descent, it was designed to capture the town, and relieve pressure on Britain&#x27;s German allies who were under French attack in Northern Europe. Wolfe was selected to take part in the expedition partly because of his friendship with its commander, Sir John Mordaunt. In addition to his regimental duties, Wolfe also served as Quartermaster General for the whole expedition. The force was assembled on the Isle of Wight and after weeks of delay finally sailed on 7 September.

The attempt failed as, after capturing an island offshore, the British made no attempt to land on the mainland and press on to Rochefort and instead withdrew home. While their sudden appearance off the French coast had spread panic throughout France, it had little practical effect. Mordaunt was court-martialed for his failure to attack Rochefort, although acquitted. Nonetheless, Wolfe was one of the few military leaders who had distinguished himself in the raid – having gone ashore to scout the terrain, and having constantly urged Mordaunt into action. He had at one point told the General that he could capture Rochefort if he was given just 500 men but Mordaunt refused him permission. While Wolfe was irritated by the failure, believing that they should have used the advantage of surprise and attacked and taken the town immediately, he was able to draw valuable lessons about amphibious warfare that influenced his later operations at Louisbourg and Quebec.

As a result of his actions at Rochefort, Wolfe was brought to the notice of the Prime Minister, William Pitt the Elder. Pitt had determined that the best gains in the war were to be made in North America where France was vulnerable, and planned to launch an assault on French Canada. Pitt now decided to promote Wolfe over the heads of a number of senior officers.

===Louisbourg===


On 23 January 1758, James Wolfe was appointed as a brigadier general, and sent with Major General Jeffrey Amherst in the fleet of Admiral Boscawen to lay siege to the Fortress of Louisbourg in New France (located in present-day Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia). Louisbourg stood near the mouth of the St Lawrence River, and its capture was considered essential to any attack on Canada from the east. An expedition the previous year had failed to seize the town, because of a French naval build-up. For 1758 Pitt sent a much larger Royal Navy force to accompany Amherst&#x27;s troops. Wolfe distinguished himself in preparations for the assault, the initial landing and in the aggressive advance of siege batteries. The French capitulated in June of that year in the Siege of Louisbourg (1758). He then participated in the Expulsion of the Acadians in the Gulf of St. Lawrence Campaign (1758).

The British had initially planned to advance along the St Lawrence and attack Quebec that year, but the onset of winter forced them to postpone to the following year. Similarly a plan to capture New Orleans was rejected, and Wolfe returned home to England. Wolfe&#x27;s part in the taking of the town brought him to the attention of the British public for the first time. The news of the victory at Louisbourg was tempered by the failure of a British force advancing towards Montreal at the Battle of Carillon and the death of George Howe, a widely respected young general whom Wolfe described as &quot;the best officer in the British Army&quot;. He died at almost the same time as the French general.

=== Québec (1759)===

====Appointment====
As Wolfe had comported himself admirably at Louisbourg, William Pitt the Elder chose him to lead the British assault on Québec City the following year. Although Wolfe was given the local rank of major general while serving in Canada, in Europe he was still only a full colonel. Amherst had been appointed as Commander-in-Chief in North America, and he would lead a separate and larger force that would attack Canada from the south. He insisted on the choice of his friend, the Irish officer Guy Carleton as Quartermaster General and threatened to resign the command should his friend not have been chosen. Once this was granted, he began making preparations for his departure. Pitt was determined to once again give operations in North America top priority, as he planned to weaken France&#x27;s international position by sailing back to India.

====Advance up the Saint Lawrence====
Despite the large build-up of British forces in North America, the strategy of dividing the army for separate attacks on Canada meant that once Wolfe reached Quebec the French commander Louis-Joseph de Montcalm would have a local superiority of troops having raised large numbers of Canadian militia to defend their homeland. The French had initially expected the British to approach from the east, believing the St Lawrence River was impassable for such a large force and had prepared to defend Quebec from the south and west. An intercepted copy of British plans gave Montcalm several weeks to improve the fortifications protecting Quebec from an amphibious attack by Wolfe.

Montcalm&#x27;s goal was to prevent the British from capturing Quebec, thereby maintaining a French foothold in Canada. The French government believed a peace treaty was likely to be agreed the following year and so they directed the emphasis of their own efforts towards victory in Germany and a planned invasion of Britain hoping thereby to secure the exchange of captured territories. For this plan to be successful Montcalm had only to hold out until the start of winter. Wolfe had a narrow window to capture Quebec during 1759 before the St Lawrence began to freeze, trapping his force.

Wolfe&#x27;s army was assembled at Louisbourg. He expected to lead 12,000 men, but was greeted by only approximately 400 officers, 7,000 regular troops, and 300 gunners. Wolfe&#x27;s troops were supported by a fleet of 49 ships and 140 smaller craft led by Admiral Charles Saunders. Eager to begin the campaign, after several delays, he pushed ahead with only part of his force and left orders for further arrivals to be sent on up the St Lawrence after him.

====Siege====

The British army laid siege to the city for three months. During that time, Wolfe issued a written document, known as Wolfe&#x27;s Manifesto, to the French-Canadian civilians, as part of his strategy of psychological intimidation. In March 1759, prior to arriving at Quebec, Wolfe had written to Amherst: &quot;If, by accident in the river, by the enemy&#x27;s resistance, by sickness, or slaughter in the army, or, from any other cause, we find that Quebec is not likely to fall into our hands (persevering however to the last moment), I propose to set the town on fire with shells, to destroy the harvest, houses and cattle, both above and below, to send off as many Canadians as possible to Europe and to leave famine and desolation behind me; ; but we must teach these scoundrels to make war in a more gentleman like manner.&quot; This manifesto has widely been regarded as counter-productive as it drove many neutrally-inclined inhabitants to actively resist the British, swelling the size of the militia defending to Quebec to as many as 10,000.

After an extensive yet inconclusive bombardment of the city, Wolfe initiated a failed attack north of Quebec at Beauport, where the French were securely entrenched. As the weeks wore on the chances of British success lessened, and Wolfe grew despondent. Amherst&#x27;s large force advancing on Montreal had made very slow progress, ruling out the prospect of Wolfe receiving any help from him.

====Battle and subsequent death====

Wolfe then led 4,400 men in small boats on a very bold and risky amphibious landing at the base of the cliffs west of Quebec along the St. Lawrence River. His army, with two small cannons, scaled the 200-metre cliff from the river below early in the morning of 13 September 1759. They surprised the French under the command of the Marquis de Montcalm, who thought the cliff would be unclimbable, and had set his defences accordingly. Faced with the possibility that the British would haul more cannons up the cliffs and knock down the city&#x27;s remaining walls, the French fought the British on the Plains of Abraham. They were defeated after fifteen minutes of battle, but when Wolfe began to move forward, he was shot thrice, once in the arm, once in the shoulder, and finally in the chest.

Historian Francis Parkman describes the death of Wolfe:


The Battle of the Plains of Abraham caused the deaths of the top military commander on each side: Montcalm died the next day from his wounds. Wolfe&#x27;s victory at Quebec enabled the Montreal Campaign against the French the following year. With the fall of that city, French rule in North America, outside of Louisiana and the tiny islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, came to an end.

Wolfe&#x27;s body was returned to Britain on HMS &quot;Royal William&quot; and interred in the family vault in St Alfege Church, Greenwich alongside his father (who had died in March 1759). The funeral service took place on 20 November 1759, the same day that Admiral Hawke won the last of the three great victories of the &quot;Wonderful Year&quot; and the &quot;Year of Victories&quot; – Minden, Quebec and Quiberon Bay.

==Character==
Wolfe was renowned by his troops for being demanding on himself and on them. He was also known for carrying the same combat equipment as his infantrymen – a musket, cartridge box and bayonet – which was unusual for officers of the period. Although he was prone to illness, Wolfe was an active and restless figure. Amherst reported that Wolfe seemed to be everywhere at once. There was a story that when someone in the British Court branded the young Brigadier mad, King George II retorted, &quot;Mad, is he? Then I hope he will bite some of my other generals.&quot; A cultured man, before the Battle of the Plains of Abraham Wolfe is said by John Robison to have recited Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot;, containing the line &quot;The paths of glory lead but to the grave&quot; to his officers, adding: &quot;Gentlemen, I would rather have written that poem than take Quebec tomorrow&quot;.

After being stung by rejection, in a letter to his mother in 1751 he admitted he would probably never marry and stated that he believed people could easily live without marrying. An apocryphal story was published after Wolfe&#x27;s death saying that he had carried a locket portrait of Katherine Lowther, his supposed betrothed, with him to North America, and that he gave the locket to First Lieutenant John Jervis the night before he died. The story holds that Wolfe had a premonition of his own death in battle, and that Jervis faithfully returned the locket to Lowther.

==Legacy==


The inscription on the obelisk at Quebec City, erected to commemorate the battle on the Plains of Abraham once read: &quot;Here Died Wolfe Victorious.&quot; In order to avoid offending French-Canadians it now simply reads: &quot;Here Died Wolfe.&quot;
Wolfe&#x27;s defeat of the French led to the British capture of the New France department of Canada, and his &quot;hero&#x27;s death&quot; made him a legend in his homeland. The Wolfe legend led to the famous painting &quot;The Death of General Wolfe&quot; by Benjamin West, the Anglo-American folk ballad &quot;Brave Wolfe&quot; (sometimes known as &quot;Bold Wolfe&quot;), and the opening line of the patriotic Canadian anthem &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;.

In 1792, scant months after the partition of Quebec into the provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada, the lieutenant-governor of the former, John Graves Simcoe, named the archipelago at the entrance to the St. Lawrence River for the victorious generals: Wolfe Island, Amherst Island, Howe Island, Carleton Island and Gage Island, for Thomas Gage. The last is now known as Simcoe Island.

In 1832, the first war monument in present-day Canada was erected on the site where Wolfe purportedly fell. The site is marked by a column surmounted by a helmet and sword. An inscription at its base reads, in French and English, &quot;Here died Wolfe – 13 September 1759.&quot; It replaces a large stone which had been placed there by British troops to mark the spot.

Wolfe&#x27;s Landing National Historic Site of Canada is located in Kennington Cove, on the east coast of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. Contained entirely within the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site of Canada, the site is bounded by a rocky beach to the south, and a rolling landscape of grasses and forest to the north, east and west. It was from this site that, during the Seven Years&#x27; War, British forces launched their successful attack on the French forces at Louisbourg. Wolfe&#x27;s Landing was designated a national historic site of Canada in 1929 because: &quot;here, on 8 June 1758, the men of Brigadier General James Wolfe&#x27;s brigade made their successful landing, leading to the capitulation of Louisbourg&quot;.

There is a memorial to Wolfe in Westminster Abbey by Joseph Wilton. The 3rd Duke of Richmond, who had served in Wolfe&#x27;s regiment in 1753, commissioned a bust of Wolfe from Wilton. There is an oil painting &quot;Placing the Canadian Colours on Wolfe&#x27;s Monument in Westminster Abbey&quot; by Emily Warren in Currie Hall at the Royal Military College of Canada.

A statue of Wolfe overlooks the Royal Naval College in Greenwich, a spot which has become increasingly popular for its panoramic views of London. A statue also graces the green in his native Westerham, Kent, alongside one of that village&#x27;s other famous resident, Sir Winston Churchill. At Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire there is an obelisk, known as Wolfe&#x27;s obelisk, built by the family that owned Stowe as Wolfe spent his last night in England at the mansion. Wolfe is buried under the Church of St Alfege, Greenwich, where there are four memorials to him: a replica of his coffin plate in the floor; &quot;The Death of Wolfe&quot;, a painting completed in 1762 by Edward Peary; a wall tablet; and a stained glass window. In addition the local primary school is named after him. The house in Greenwich where he lived, Macartney House, has an English Heritage blue plaque with his name on, and a nearby road is named General Wolfe Road after him.

In 1761, as a perpetual memorial to Wolfe, George Warde, a friend of Wolfe&#x27;s from boyhood, instituted the Wolfe Society, which to this day meets annually in Westerham for the Wolfe Dinner to his &quot;Pious and Immortal Memory&quot;. Warde paid Benjamin West to paint &quot;The Boyhood of Wolfe&quot; which used to hang at Squerres Court but has recently been donated to the National Trust and is now hung at Quebec House his childhood home in Westerham. Warde also erected a cenotaph in Squerres Park to mark the place where Wolfe had received his first commission while visiting the Wardes.

There are several institutions, localities, thoroughfares, and landforms named in honour of him in Canada. Significant monuments to Wolfe in Canada exist on the Plains of Abraham where he fell, and near Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Ontario Governor John Graves Simcoe named Wolfe Island, an island in Lake Ontario and the Saint Lawrence River off the coast of Kingston (near the Royal Military College of Canada) in Wolfe&#x27;s honour in 1792. On 13 September 2009, the Wolfe Island Historical Society led celebrations on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of James Wolfe&#x27;s victory at Quebec. A life-size statue in Wolfe&#x27;s likeness is to be sculpted.

South Mount Royal Park, Calgary is home to a James Wolfe statue since 2009, but it was originally located in Exchange Court in New York City. It was sculpted in 1898 by John Massey Rhind and moved into storage around 1945 to 1950, sold in 1967 and relocated to Centennial Planetarium in Calgary, stored 2000 to 2008 and finally installed again in 2009.

A senior girls house at the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School is named after Wolfe, where all houses are named after prominent figures of the military. There is a James Wolfe school for children aged 5–11 down the hill from his house in Greenwich, in Chesterfield Walk, which is just east of General Wolfe Road.

His letters home from the age of 13 until his death as well as his copy of Gray&#x27;s &quot;Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard&quot; and other items are housed at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library in Toronto, Ontario. Other artefacts and relics owned by Wolfe are held at museums in both Canada and England, although some have mainly legendary association. Wolfe&#x27;s cloak worn at Louisbourg, Quebec and at the Plains of Abraham is part of the British Royal Collection. In 2008 it was lent to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia for an exhibit on the Siege of Louisbourg, and in 2009 was loaned to the Army Museum at the Halifax Citadel where it remains on display. Wolfe Crescent, Halifax, Nova Scotia is named after Wolfe.

Point Wolfe is a former village and current campground located in Fundy National Park, which additionally contains the Point Wolfe Bridge. The town of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire is named in honour of Wolfe. In Montreal, Rue Wolfe parallels Rue Montcalm and Rue Amherst, while in the Quebec City neighbourhood of Ste-Foy, he has given his name to an avenue.

<text>Sir Henry Joseph Wood (3 March 186919 August 1944) was an English conductor best known for his association with London&#x27;s annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms. He conducted them for nearly half a century, introducing hundreds of new works to British audiences. After his death, the concerts were officially renamed in his honour as the &quot;Henry Wood Promenade Concerts&quot;, although they continued to be generally referred to as &quot;the Proms&quot;.

Born in modest circumstances to parents who encouraged his musical talent, Wood started his career as an organist. During his studies at the Royal Academy of Music, he came under the influence of the voice teacher Manuel García and became his accompanist. After similar work for Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte&#x27;s opera companies on the works of Arthur Sullivan and others, Wood became the conductor of a small operatic touring company. He was soon engaged by the larger Carl Rosa Opera Company. One notable event in his operatic career was conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in 1892.

From the mid-1890s until his death, Wood focused on concert conducting. He was engaged by the impresario Robert Newman to conduct a series of promenade concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, offering a mixture of classical and popular music at low prices. The series was successful, and Wood conducted annual promenade series until his death in 1944. By the 1920s, Wood had steered the repertoire entirely to classical music. When the Queen&#x27;s Hall was destroyed by bombing in 1941, the Proms moved to the Royal Albert Hall.

Wood declined the chief conductorships of the New York Philharmonic and Boston Symphony Orchestras, believing it his duty to serve music in the United Kingdom. In addition to the Proms, he conducted concerts and festivals throughout the country and also trained the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music. He had an enormous influence on the musical life of Britain over his long career: he and Newman greatly improved access to classical music, and Wood raised the standard of orchestral playing and nurtured the taste of the public, presenting a vast repertoire of music spanning four centuries.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, on 3 March 1869, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, &quot;née&quot; Morris. Wood senior had started in his family&#x27;s pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son&#x27;s birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as &quot;the musicians&#x27; church&quot;. His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son&#x27;s interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola.
Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper&#x27;s successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the International Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.

After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether he was a member of Manuel Garcia&#x27;s singing class, but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly influenced by Garcia. Wood also accompanied the opera class, taught by Garcia&#x27;s son Gustave. Wood&#x27;s ambition at the time was to become a teacher of singing, and he gave singing lessons throughout his life. He attended the classes of as many singing teachers as he could, although by his own account, &quot;I possess a terrible voice. Garcia said it would go through a brick wall. In fact, a real conductor&#x27;s voice.&quot;

===Opera===
On leaving the Royal Academy of Music in 1888, Wood taught singing privately and was soon very successful, attracting &quot;more singing pupils than I could comfortably deal with&quot; at half a guinea an hour. He also worked as a répétiteur. According to his memoirs, he worked in that capacity for Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte during the rehearsals for the first production of &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot; at the Savoy Theatre in 1888. His biographer Arthur Jacobs doubts this and discounts exchanges Wood purported to have had with Sir Arthur Sullivan about the score. Jacobs describes Wood&#x27;s memoirs as &quot;vivacious in style but factually unreliable&quot;.
It is certain, however, that Wood was répétiteur at Carte&#x27;s Royal English Opera House for Sullivan&#x27;s grand opera &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; in late 1890 and early 1891, and for André Messager&#x27;s &quot;La Basoche&quot; in 1891–92. He also worked for Carte at the Savoy as assistant to François Cellier on &quot;The Nautch Girl&quot; in 1891. Wood remained devoted to Sullivan&#x27;s music and later insisted on programming his concert works when they were out of fashion in musical circles. During this period, he had several compositions of his own performed, including an oratorio, &quot;St. Dorothea&quot; (1889), a light opera, &quot;Daisy&quot; (1890), and a one-act comic opera, &quot;Returning the Compliment&quot; (1890).

Wood recalled that his first professional appearance as a conductor was at a choral concert in December 1887. Ad hoc engagements of this kind were commonplace for organists, but they brought little prestige such as was given to British conductor-composers such as Sullivan, Charles Villiers Stanford and Alexander Mackenzie, or the rising generation of German star conductors led by Hans Richter and Arthur Nikisch. His first sustained work as a conductor was his 1889 appointment as musical director of a small touring opera ensemble, the Arthur Rouseby English Touring Opera. The company was not of a high standard, with an orchestra of only six players augmented by local recruits at each tour venue. Wood eventually negotiated a release from his contract, and after a brief return to teaching he secured a better appointment as conductor for the Carl Rosa Opera Company in 1891. For that company he conducted &quot;Carmen&quot;, &quot;The Bohemian Girl&quot;, &quot;The Daughter of the Regiment&quot;, &quot;Maritana&quot;, and &quot;Il trovatore&quot;. This appointment was followed by a similar engagement with a company set up by former Carl Rosa singers.

When Signor Lago, formerly impresario of the Imperial Opera Company of St. Petersburg, was looking for a second conductor to work with Luigi Arditi for a proposed London season, Garcia recommended Wood. The season opened at the newly rebuilt Olympic Theatre in London, in October 1892, with Wood conducting the British premiere of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. At that time the operatic conductor was not seen as an important figure, but the critics who chose to mention the conducting gave Wood good reviews. The work was not popular with the public, and the season was cut short when Lago absconded, leaving the company unpaid. Before that debacle, Wood had also conducted performances of &quot;Maritana&quot; and rehearsed &quot;Oberon&quot; and &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. After the collapse of the Olympic opera season, Wood returned once more to his singing tuition. In 1894 he contributed to a song in the operetta &quot;The Lady Slavey&quot; and also conducted performances during its three month London run. With the exception of a season at the Opera Comique in 1896, Wood&#x27;s subsequent conducting career was in the concert hall.

===Early years of the Proms===

In 1894, Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen&#x27;s Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan&#x27;s concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: &quot;I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.&quot;

Newman&#x27;s determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.

Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard &quot;diapason normal&quot;. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers&#x27; voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher, agreed. As members of Wood&#x27;s brass and woodwind sections were unwilling to buy new low-pitched instruments, Cathcart imported a set from Belgium and lent them to the players. After a season, the players recognised that the low pitch would be permanently adopted, and they bought the instruments from him.

On 10 August 1895, the first of the Queen&#x27;s Hall Promenade Concerts took place. Among those present who later recalled the opening was the singer Agnes Nicholls:

Just before 8 o&#x27;clock I saw Henry Wood take up his position behind the curtain at the end of the platform – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem ... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the &quot;Rienzi&quot; Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.

The rest of the programme comprised, in the words of an historian of the Proms, David Cox, &quot;for the most part ... blatant trivialities.&quot; Within days, however, Wood was shifting the balance from light music to mainstream classical works, with Schubert&#x27;s Unfinished Symphony and further excerpts from Wagner operas. Among the other symphonies Wood conducted during the first season were Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Great C Major&quot;, Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Italian&quot; and Schumann&#x27;s Fourth. The concertos included Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto and Schumann&#x27;s Piano Concerto. During the season Wood presented 23 novelties, including the London premieres of pieces by Richard Strauss, Tchaikovsky, Glazunov, Massenet and Rimsky-Korsakov. Newman and Wood soon felt able to devote every Monday night of the season principally to Wagner and every Friday night to Beethoven, a pattern that endured for decades.

The income from the concerts did not permit generous rehearsal time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week&#x27;s six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that &quot;if you watched him, you couldn&#x27;t come in wrong.&quot; The violist Bernard Shore wrote, &quot;You may be reading at sight in public, but you can&#x27;t possibly go wrong with &quot;that&quot; stick in front of you&quot;. Thirty-five years after Wood&#x27;s death, André Previn recounted a story by one of his players who recalled that Wood &quot;had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10 a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time.&quot;

Another feature of Wood&#x27;s conducting was his insistence on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check the instrument of each member of the woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.
Between the first and second season of promenade concerts, Wood did his last work in the opera house, conducting Stanford&#x27;s new opera &quot;Shamus O&#x27;Brien&quot; at the Opera Comique. It ran from March until July 1896, leaving Wood enough time to prepare the second Queen&#x27;s Hall season, which began at the end of August. The season was so successful that Newman followed it with a winter season of Saturday night promenade concerts, but despite being popular they were not a financial success, and were not repeated in later years. 

In January 1897, Wood took on the direction of the Queen&#x27;s Hall&#x27;s prestigious Saturday afternoon symphony concerts. He continually presented new works by composers of many nationalities, and was particularly known for his skill in Russian music. Sullivan wrote to him in 1898, &quot;I have never heard a finer performance in England than that of the Tchaikovsky symphony under your direction last Wednesday&quot;. Seventy-five years later, Sir Adrian Boult ranked Wood as one of the two greatest Tchaikovsky conductors in his long experience. Wood also successfully challenged the widespread belief that Englishmen were not capable of conducting Wagner. When Wood and the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra performed at Windsor Castle in November 1898, Queen Victoria chose Tchaikovsky and Wagner for the programme. Wood, who modelled his appearance on Nikisch, took it as a compliment that the queen said to him, &quot;Tell me, Mr Wood, are you quite English?&quot;

In 1898, Wood married one of his singing pupils, Olga Michailoff, a divorcée a few months his senior. Jacobs describes it as &quot;a marriage of perfect professional and private harmony&quot;. As a singer, with Wood as her accompanist, she won praise from the critics.

===Early 20th century===
The promenade concerts flourished through the 1890s, but in 1902 Newman, who had been investing unwisely in theatrical presentations, found himself unable to bear the financial responsibility for the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra and was declared bankrupt. The concerts were rescued by the musical benefactor Sir Edgar Speyer, a banker of German origin. Speyer put up the necessary funds, retained Newman as manager of the concerts, and encouraged him and Wood to continue with their project of improving the public&#x27;s taste. At the beginning of 1902, Wood accepted the conductorship of that year&#x27;s Sheffield triennial festival. He continued to be associated with that festival until 1936, changing its emphasis from choral to orchestral pieces. A German critic, reviewing the festival for a Berlin publication, wrote, &quot;Two personalities now represent a new epoch in English musical life – Edward Elgar as composer, and Henry J. Wood as conductor.&quot; 

Later that year, overtaxed by his enormous workload, Wood&#x27;s health broke down. Even though this was during the Proms season, Cathcart insisted that Wood should have a complete break and change of scene. Leaving the leader of the orchestra, Arthur Payne, to conduct during his absence, Wood and his wife took a cruise to Morocco, missing the Proms concerts from 13 October to 8 November.

In the early years of the Proms there were complaints in some musical journals that Wood was neglecting British music. In 1899, Newman unsuccessfully attempted to secure for Wood the premiere of Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, but in the same year Newman passed up the opportunity to introduce the music of Delius to London concertgoers. By the end of the first decade of the new century, however, Wood&#x27;s reputation in conducting British music was in no doubt; he gave the world, British or London premieres of more than a hundred British works between 1900 and 1910. Meanwhile, he introduced his audiences to many European composers. In the 1903 season, he programmed symphonies by Bruckner (No. 7), Sibelius (No. 1), and Mahler (No. 1). In the same year, he introduced several of Richard Strauss&#x27;s tone poems to London, and in 1905 he gave Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Symphonia Domestica&quot;. This prompted the composer to write, &quot;I cannot leave London without an expression of admiration for the splendid Orchestra which Henry Wood&#x27;s master hand has created in such a short time.&quot;

Creating the orchestra admired by Strauss had not been achieved without a struggle. In 1904, Wood and Newman tackled the deputy system, in which orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the Royal Philharmonic Society described it thus: &quot;A, whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends B (whom you don&#x27;t mind) to the first rehearsal. B, without your knowledge or consent, sends C to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, C sends D, whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away.&quot; After a rehearsal in which Wood was faced with a sea of entirely unfamiliar faces in his own orchestra, Newman came on the platform to announce: &quot;Gentlemen, in future there will be no deputies; good morning.&quot; Forty players resigned en bloc and formed their own orchestra: the London Symphony Orchestra. Wood bore no grudge and attended their first concert, although it was 12 years before he agreed to conduct the orchestra.

Wood had great sympathy for rank-and-file orchestral players and strove for improvements in their pay. He sought to raise their status and was the first British conductor to insist that the orchestra should stand to acknowledge applause along with the conductor. He introduced women into the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra in 1913. He said, &quot;I do not like ladies playing the trombone or double bass, but they can play the violin, and they do.&quot; By 1918 Wood had 14 women in his orchestra.

Wood conducted his own compositions and arrangements from time to time. He gave his &quot;Fantasia on Welsh Melodies&quot; and &quot;Fantasia on Scottish Melodies&quot; on successive nights in 1909. He composed the work for which he is most celebrated, &quot;Fantasia on British Sea Songs&quot;, for a concert in 1905, celebrating the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar. It caught the public fancy immediately, with its mixture of sea-shanties, together with Handel&#x27;s &quot;See the Conquering Hero Comes&quot; and Arne&#x27;s &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; He played it at the Proms more than 40 times, and it became a fixture at the &quot;Last Night of the Proms&quot;, the lively concert marking the end of each season. It remained so under his successors, though often rearranged, notably by Sir Malcolm Sargent. A highlight of the Fantasia is the hornpipe (&quot;Jack&#x27;s the Lad&quot;); Wood said of it:

They stamp their feet in time to the hornpipe – that is until I whip up the orchestra to a fierce &quot;accelerando&quot; which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy it as much as they.

Among Wood&#x27;s other works was his &quot;Purcell Suite&quot;, incorporating themes from Purcell&#x27;s stage works and string sonatas, which Wood performed at an orchestral festival in Zurich in 1921, and orchestral transcriptions of works by a range of composers from Albéniz to Vivaldi.

Wood worked with his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at her recitals. In 1906, at the Norwich music festival he presented Beethoven&#x27;s Choral Symphony and Bach&#x27;s &quot;St Matthew Passion&quot;, with his wife among the singers. 

In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died. Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss. On his return, Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga&#x27;s death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics. 

In June 1911, he married his secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex (1882–1967), with whom he had two daughters. In the same year he accepted a knighthood, and declined the conductorship of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in succession to Mahler, as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.

Throughout the early part of the century, Wood was influential in changing the habits of concertgoers. Until then it had been customary for audiences at symphony or choral concerts to applaud after each movement or section. Wood discouraged this, sometime by gesture and sometimes by specific request printed in programmes. For this he was much praised in the musical and national press. In addition to his work at the Queen&#x27;s Hall, Wood conducted at the Sheffield, Norwich, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Westmorland festivals, and at orchestral concerts in Cardiff, Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester and Hull. His programming was summarised in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, which listed the number of each composer&#x27;s works played in the 1911 Proms season; the top ten were: Wagner (121); Beethoven (34); Tchaikovsky (30); Mozart (28); Dvořák (16); Weber (16); J.S. Bach (14); Brahms (14); Elgar (14); and Liszt (13).

The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are singled out by Cox as among the finest of this part of Wood&#x27;s career. Among those conducting their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Five Pieces for Orchestra&quot; also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, &quot;Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you&#x27;ll have to play in 25 years&#x27; time&quot;. The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: &quot;It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen&#x27;s Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it was laughing, and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London.&quot; However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work&#x27;s second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more appreciatively received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: &quot;I must say it was the first time since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands.&quot;

===First World War and post-war===
On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Newman, Wood and Speyer discussed whether the Proms should continue as planned. They had by this time become an established institution, and it was agreed to go ahead. However, anti-German feeling forced Speyer to leave the country and seek refuge in the US, and there was a campaign to ban all German music from concerts. Newman put out a statement declaring that German music would be played as planned: &quot;The greatest examples of Music and Art are world possessions and unassailable even by the prejudices and passions of the hour.&quot; When Speyer left Britain, the music publishers Chappell&#x27;s took on the responsibility for the Queen&#x27;s Hall and its orchestra. The Proms continued throughout the war years, with fewer major new works than before, although there were nevertheless British premieres of pieces by Bartók, Stravinsky and Debussy. An historian of the Proms, Ateş Orga, wrote, &quot;Concerts often had to be re-timed to coincide with the &#x27;All Clear&#x27; between air raids. Falling bombs, shrapnel, anti-aircraft fire and the droning of Zeppelins were ever threatening. But [Wood] kept things on the go and in the end had a very real part to play in boosting morale.&quot;

Towards the end of the war, Wood received an offer by which he was seriously tempted: the Boston Symphony Orchestra invited him to become its musical director. He had been guest conductor of the Berlin and New York Philharmonic Orchestras, but he regarded the Boston orchestra as the finest in the world. Nonetheless, as he told Boult, &quot;it was hard to refuse, but I felt it was a patriotic duty to remain in my own country, at the present moment.&quot;

After the war, the Proms continued much as before. The second halves of concerts still featured piano-accompanied songs rather than serious classical music. Chappell&#x27;s, having taken over sponsorship of the Proms and spent £35,000 keeping the Queen&#x27;s Hall going during the war, wished to promote songs published by the company. The management of Chappell&#x27;s were also less enthusiastic than Wood and Newman about promoting new orchestral works, most of which were not profitable.

In 1921, Wood was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first English conductor to receive the honour. By now he was beginning to find his position as Britain&#x27;s leading conductor under challenge from rising younger rivals. Thomas Beecham had been an increasingly influential figure since about 1910. He and Wood did not like one another, and each avoided mention of the other in his memoirs. 

Adrian Boult, who, at Wood&#x27;s recommendation, took over some of his responsibilities at Birmingham in 1923, always admired and respected Wood. Other younger conductors included men who had been members of Wood&#x27;s orchestra, including Basil Cameron and Eugene Goossens. Another protégé of Wood was Malcolm Sargent, who appeared at the Proms as a composer-conductor in 1921 and 1922. Wood encouraged him to abandon thoughts of a career as a pianist and to concentrate on conducting. Wood further showed his interest in the future of music by taking on the conductorship of the student orchestra at the Royal Academy of Music in 1923, rehearsing it twice a week, whenever possible, for the next twenty years. In the same year, he accepted the conductorship of the amateur Hull Philharmonic Orchestra, travelling three times a year until 1939 to rehearse and conduct its concerts.

In 1925, Wood was invited to conduct four concerts for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra at the Hollywood Bowl. Such was their success, both artistic and financial, that Wood was invited back, and conducted again the following year. In addition to a large number of English pieces, Wood programmed works by composers as diverse as Bach and Stravinsky. He again conducted there in 1934.

===BBC and the Proms===
On his return to England from his first Hollywood trip, Wood found himself in the middle of a feud between the chairman of Chappell&#x27;s, William Boosey, and the BBC. Boosey had conceived a passionate hostility to the broadcasting of music, fearing that it would lead to the end of live concerts. He attempted to prevent anyone who wished to perform at the Queen&#x27;s Hall from broadcasting for the BBC. This affected many of the artists whom Wood and Newman needed for the Proms. The matter was unresolved when Newman died in 1926. Shortly afterwards, Boosey announced that Chappell&#x27;s would no longer support concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The prospect that the Proms might not be able to continue caused widespread dismay, and there was a general welcome for the BBC&#x27;s announcement that it would take over the running of the Proms, and would also run a winter series of symphony concerts at the Queen&#x27;s Hall.
The BBC regime brought immediate benefits. The use of the second half of concerts to promote Chappell&#x27;s songs ceased, to be replaced by music chosen for its own excellence: on the first night under the BBC&#x27;s control, the songs in the second half were by Schubert, Quilter and Parry rather than ballads from Chappell&#x27;s. For Wood, the greatest benefit was that the BBC gave him twice as much rehearsal time as he had previously enjoyed. He now had a daily rehearsal and extra rehearsals as needed. He was also allowed extra players when large scores called for them, instead of having to rescore the work for the forces available.

In 1929, Wood played a celebrated practical joke on musicologists and critics. &quot;I got &quot;very fed up with them&quot;, always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... &#x27;spoiling the original&#x27; etc. etc.&quot;, and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D minor&quot;, as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood&#x27;s later account, the press and the BBC &quot;fell into the trap and said the scoring was wonderful, Klenovsky had the real flare for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and &quot;asked for&quot;.&quot; Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. The press treated the deception as a great joke; &quot;The Times&quot; entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.

As Wood&#x27;s working life took a turn for the better, his domestic life started to deteriorate. During the early 1930s, he and his wife gradually became estranged, and their relationship ended in bitterness, with Muriel taking most of Wood&#x27;s money and, for much of the time, living abroad. She refused to divorce him. The breach between Muriel and Wood also caused his estrangement from their daughters. In 1934 he began a happy relationship with a widowed former pupil, Jessie Linton, who had sung for him frequently in the past under her professional name of Jessie Goldsack. One of Wood&#x27;s players recalled, &quot;She changed him. He had been badly dressed, awful clothes. Jessie got him a new evening suit, instead of the mouldy green one, and he flourished yellow gloves and a cigar ... he became human.&quot; As Wood was not free to remarry, she changed her name by deed poll to &quot;Lady Jessie Wood&quot; and was generally assumed by the public to be Wood&#x27;s wife. In his memoirs, Wood mentioned neither his second marriage nor his subsequent relationship.

In his later years, Wood came to be identified with the Proms rather than with the year-round concert season. Boult was appointed director of music at the BBC in 1930. In that capacity he strove to ensure that Wood was invited to conduct a fitting number of BBC symphony concerts outside the Prom season. The BBC chose Wood for important collaborations with Bartók and Paul Hindemith, and for the first British performance of Mahler&#x27;s vast Symphony No. 8. But Jacobs notes that, in the general concert repertory, Wood now had to compete against well-known foreign conductors such as Bruno Walter, Willem Mengelberg, and Arturo Toscanini, &quot;in comparison with whom he was increasingly seen as a workhorse&quot;.

===Last years===
In 1936, Wood was in charge of his final Sheffield festival. The choral works he conducted included the Verdi &quot;Requiem&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot;, Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Te Deum&quot;, Walton&#x27;s &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, and, in the presence of the composer, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;The Bells&quot;. The following year, Wood began planning for a grand concert to mark his fiftieth year as a conductor. The Royal Albert Hall was chosen as the venue, having a far larger capacity than the Queen&#x27;s Hall. The concert was given on 5 October 1938. Rachmaninoff played the solo part in his Second Piano Concerto, and Vaughan Williams, at Wood&#x27;s request, composed a short choral work for the occasion: the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; for orchestra and 16 soloists. The other composers represented in the programme were Sullivan, Beethoven, Bach, Bax, Wagner, Handel and Elgar. The orchestra comprised players from the three London orchestras: the London Symphony, London Philharmonic and BBC Symphony Orchestras. The concert raised £9,000 for Wood&#x27;s chosen charity, providing health care for musicians. In the same year, Wood published his autobiography, &quot;My Life of Music&quot;.
In September 1939, the Second World War broke out and the BBC immediately put into effect its contingency plans to move much of its broadcasting away from London to places thought less susceptible to bombing. Its musical activities, including the orchestra, moved to Bristol. The BBC withdrew not only the players, but financial support from the Proms. Wood determined that the 1940 season would nevertheless go ahead. The Royal Philharmonic Society and a private entrepreneur, Keith Douglas, agreed to back an eight-week season, and the London Symphony Orchestra was engaged. The season was curtailed after four weeks, when intense bombing forced the Queen&#x27;s Hall to close. The last Prom given at the Queen&#x27;s Hall was on 7 September 1940. In May 1941, the hall was destroyed by bombs.

It was immediately agreed that the 1941 season of Proms should be held at the Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen&#x27;s Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood&#x27;s associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood&#x27;s health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year&#x27;s season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen&#x27;s Hall.
Despite his age and the difficulties of wartime travel, Wood insisted on going to provincial cities to conduct – as much, according to Jacobs, to help the local orchestras survive as to gratify audiences. His final season was in 1944. The season began well with Wood in good form, but after three weeks raids by the devastating new German flying bombs caused the government to order the closure of places of entertainment. The Proms were immediately relocated to Bedford some away, where Wood continued to conduct. He was taken ill in early August and was unable to conduct the fiftieth anniversary Prom on 10 August; he was forbidden by his doctor even to listen to its broadcast. Wood died just over a week later on 19 August at Hitchin Hospital in Hitchin, Hertfordshire; his funeral service was held in the town at St Mary&#x27;s church, and his ashes were interred in the Musicians&#x27; Chapel of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate.

His arrangement of the national anthem was continued for the Last Night of the Proms until 2009, when Benjamin Britten’s arrangement replaced it in 2010. In 2022, the American Philadelphia Orchestra played Wood&#x27;s arrangement of the national anthem out of respect for the recently deceased Queen Elizabeth II. Wood’s arrangement was bought back in 2023 for closing night, and in the future closing nights of years yet to come.

==Recordings==
Wood&#x27;s recording career began in 1908, when he accompanied his wife Olga in &quot;Farewell, forests&quot; by Tchaikovsky, for the Gramophone and Typewriter Company, better known as His Master&#x27;s Voice or HMV. They made eight other records together for HMV over the next two years. After Olga&#x27;s death, Wood signed a contract with HMV&#x27;s rival, Columbia, for whom he made a series of discs between 1915 and 1917 with the singer Clara Butt, including excerpts from Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot;. 

Between 1915 and 1925, he conducted 65 recordings for Columbia using the early acoustic recording process, including many discs of Wagner excerpts and a truncated version of Elgar&#x27;s Violin Concerto with Albert Sammons as soloist. When the microphone and electrical recording were introduced in 1925, Wood re-recorded the Elgar concerto, with Sammons, and made 36 other discs for Columbia over the next nine years. The 1929 recording of the Elgar concerto has been reissued on compact disc and is well regarded by some critics.

Wood was wooed from Columbia by the young Decca company in 1935. For Decca he conducted 23 recordings over the next two years, including Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;A London Symphony&quot;. In 1938 he returned to Columbia, for whom his five new recordings included the &quot;Serenade to Music&quot; with the 16 original singers, a few days after the premiere, and his own &quot;Fantasia on British Sea Songs&quot;.

Wood&#x27;s recordings did not remain in the catalogues long after his death. &quot;The Record Guide&quot;, 1956, lists none of his records. A few of his recordings have subsequently been reissued on compact disc, including the Decca and Columbia Vaughan Williams recordings from 1936 and 1938.

==Premieres==

In Jacobs&#x27;s 1994 biography, the list of premieres conducted by Wood extends to 18 pages. His world premieres included Frank Bridge&#x27;s &quot;The Sea&quot;; Britten&#x27;s Piano Concerto; Delius&#x27;s &quot;A Song Before Sunrise&quot;, &quot;A Song of Summer&quot;, and &quot;Idyll&quot;; Elgar&#x27;s &quot;The Wand of Youth&quot; Suite No. 1, &quot;Sospiri&quot; and the 4th and 5th Pomp and Circumstance Marches; and Vaughan Williams&#x27;s &quot;Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1&quot;, &quot;Flos Campi&quot; and &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;.

Wood&#x27;s UK premieres included Bartók&#x27;s &quot;Dance Suite&quot;; Chabrier&#x27;s &quot;Joyeuse marche&quot;; Copland&#x27;s &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;; Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; and &quot;Ibéria&quot;; Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Kammermusik&quot; 2 and 5; Janáček&#x27;s Sinfonietta, &quot;Taras Bulba&quot; and Glagolitic Mass; Kodály&#x27;s &quot;Dances from Galanta&quot;; Mahler&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 4, 7 and 8, and &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;; Prokofiev&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Violin Concerto No. 2; Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No 1; Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;oye&quot;, &quot;Rapsodie espagnole&quot;, &quot;La valse&quot; and Piano Concerto in D; Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot;, &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, and Symphony No. 2; Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot;; Schumann&#x27;s Konzertstück for four horns and orchestra; Shostakovich&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Symphonies Nos. 7 and 8; Sibelius&#x27;s Symphonies Nos. 1, 6 and 7, Violin Concerto, Karelia Suite, and &quot;Tapiola&quot;; Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Symphonia Domestica&quot;; Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot; (suite); Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Manfred Symphony&quot; and &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot;; and Webern&#x27;s &quot;Passacaglia&quot;.

==Honours, memorials and reputation==
In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood&#x27;s state honours were his appointments as Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1944 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List, to the Order of the Crown (Belgium; 1920), and Officer of the Legion of Honour (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923).
In March 1963, The Henry Wood Concert Society (in association with The Henry Wood Memorial Trust) presented The Henry Wood Memorial Concert. The concert was held at the Royal Albert Hall, London and conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in the presence of H.R.H. The Duchess of Gloucester.
Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams &quot;Serenade to Music&quot;, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled &quot;Sir Henry Wood&quot;, often referred to by its first line, &quot;Where does the uttered music go?&quot;. Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre&#x27;s, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood&#x27;s honour.

Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially &quot;the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts&quot;, but universally referred to by the informal short version.

His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood:

His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him &quot;Timber&quot; – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too. His tally of first performances, or first performances in Britain, was heroic: at least 717 works by 357 composers. Greatness as measured by finesse of execution may not be his, particularly in his limited legacy of recordings, but he remains one of the most remarkable musicians Britain has produced.

<text>Johann Jakob Griesbach (4 January 1745 – 24 March 1812) was a German biblical textual critic. Griesbach&#x27;s fame rests upon his work in New Testament criticism, in which he inaugurated a new epoch. His solution to the synoptic problem bears his name, but the Griesbach hypothesis has become, in modern times, known as the Two-Gospel hypothesis.
==Education and career==
He was born at Butzbach, a small town in the state of Hesse-Darmstadt, where his father, Konrad Kaspar (1705–1777), was pastor. Griesbach was educated at Frankfurt, and at the universities of Tübingen, Leipzig and Halle, where he became one of J. S. Semler&#x27;s most ardent disciples. It was Semler who induced him to turn his attention to the textual criticism of the New Testament. At the close of his undergraduate career he undertook a literary tour through Germany, the Netherlands, France and England. In England he may have met Henry Owen whose seminal work &quot;Observations on the Four Gospels&quot; (1764) is listed among the books of Griesbach&#x27;s estate, although he does not seem to have acknowledged any indebtedness to Owen.

On his return to Halle, Griesbach acted for some time as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;, but in 1773 was appointed to a professorial chair; in 1775 he went to the University of Jena, where he spent the rest of his life (though he received calls to other universities).

==New Testament text critic==

Griesbach&#x27;s critical edition of the New Testament first appeared at Halle, in three volumes, in 1774–1775. The first volume contained the first three Gospels, synoptically arranged; the second, the Epistles and the book of Revelation. All the historical books were reprinted in one volume in 1777, the synoptical arrangement of the Gospels having been abandoned as inconvenient. Of the second edition, considerably enlarged and improved, the first volume appeared in 1796 and the second in 1806 (Halle and London). Of a third edition, edited by David Schulz, only the first volume, containing the four Gospels, appeared (1827).

For the construction of his critical text Griesbach took as his basis the &quot;Elzevir&quot; edition. Where he differed from it he placed the &quot;Elzevir&quot; reading on the inner margin along with other readings he thought worthy of special consideration (these last, however, being printed in smaller type). To all the readings on this margin he attached special marks indicating the precise degree of probability in his opinion attaching to each. In weighing these probabilities he proceeded upon a particular theory which in its leading features he had derived from J. A. Bengel and J. S. Semler, dividing all the manuscripts into three main groups – the Alexandrian, the Western and the Byzantine.

A reading supported by only one recension he considered as having only one witness in its favour; those readings which were supported by all the three recensions, or even by two of them, especially if these two were the Alexandrian and the Western, he unhesitatingly accepted as genuine. Only when each of the three recensions gives a different reading does he proceed to discuss the question on other grounds.

See his &quot;Symbolae criticae ad supplendas et corrigendas variarum N. T. lectionum collectiones&quot; (Halle, 1785, 1793), and his &quot;Commentarius criticus in textum Graecum N. T.&quot;, which extends to the end of Mark and discusses the more important various readings with great care and thoroughness (Jena, 1794 if.).

Among the other works of Griesbach (which are comparatively unimportant) may be mentioned his university thesis &quot;De codicibus quatuor evangeliorum Origenianis&quot; (Halle, 1771) and a work upon systematic theology (&quot;Anleitung zur Kenntniss der populären Dogmatik&quot;, Jena, 1779). His &quot;Opuscula&quot;, consisting chiefly of university &quot;Programs&quot; and addresses, were edited by Gabler (2 volumes, Jena, 1824).

==Gospel Synopsis==
In 1776 Griesbach published his Greek Gospel synopsis of Matthew, Mark and Luke as a volume separate from his critical edition of the New Testament (cf. above), of which it had previously been a part, and thereby established the tool of a synopsis as an essential research aid in New Testament studies.

For Griesbach&#x27;s hypothesis concerning the interrelation of the Gospel accounts of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and its modern variant, see Griesbach hypothesis.

==Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976==
To mark the bicentenary of the publication of Griesbach&#x27;s Gospel synopsis as a separate volume a group of distinguished international biblical scholars met in July 1976 at Münster/Westphalia for &quot;The Johann Jakob Griesbach Bicentenary Colloquium 1776-1976&quot;.

A selection of the papers presented at the colloquium appraising Griesbach&#x27;s life, work and influence, aimed &quot;to indicate why an understanding of this scholar&#x27;s contribution to New Testament criticism is important both for the history of New Testament scholarship and for contemporary research&quot;, together with the text in Latin and in English translation of &quot;The Dissertation of J. J. Griesbach, Doctor of Theology and Principal Professor in the University of Jena, in which he demonstrates that the entire Gospel of Mark has been extracted from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, written in the name of the University of Jena (1789–1790), now revised and furnished with many additions&quot;, are to be found in Bernard Orchard and Thomas R. W. Longstaff (ed.), &quot;J. J. Griesbach: Synoptic and Text-Critical Studies 1776-1976&quot;, Volume 34 in the SNTS Monograph Series (Cambridge University Press, hardback 1978, paperback 2005 ).

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1961 was the 6th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 18 March 1961 in the in Cannes, France. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTF), and originally known as the  (), the contest was held in following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Tom Pillibi&quot; by Jacqueline Boyer. It was the second time that France had hosted the contest, becoming the first country to host the contest on two separate occasions, following the which was also held in the in Cannes. Just as in 1959, the event was presented by Jacqueline Joubert, one of only three individuals to have hosted more than one Eurovision Song Contest. A new record of sixteen countries competed in this event, with the thirteen nations which competed in 1960 returning alongside , and , all three making their first contest appearances.

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Jacques Datin, written by and performed by Jean-Claude Pascal, the first of an eventual five contest victories for the country. Although not interpreted as such at the time, the winning song has since been reevaluated and reinterpreted as a song about homosexual love, a topic which would have been considered taboo if publicly spoken in 1961. The placed second for the third consecutive contest, while came third.

== Location ==

The 1961 contest took place in Cannes, France, following the nation&#x27;s victory at the in London, the United Kingdom, with the song &quot;Tom Pillibi&quot;, performed by Jacqueline Boyer. The selected venue was the , built in 1949 to host the Cannes Film Festival and located on the along the shore of the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the growth in the film festival a new building bearing the same name was opened in 1982, with the original building renamed as the .

This was the second time that the contest was staged in France, with the same venue having already hosted the . It also marked the first time that a country and city had staged the contest on two separate occasions.

Other events held during the week of the contest included a supper for the participating delegations, which was held after the contest in the in the city&#x27;s .

== Participating countries ==


The 1961 contest saw the first entries from , and . Joining the thirteen countries which had competed in the previous year&#x27;s event, this led to the contest growing to a record number of sixteen participants.

Bob Benny and Nora Brockstedt both made a second appearance in the contest for their respective countries. Benny had placed sixth for with the song &quot;, while Brockstedt had placed fourth for with &quot;. Also among the participating artists was &#x27;s Lale Andersen, who had gained significant international fame and popularity during World War II, both in Allied and Axis countries, for her interpretation of &quot;Lili Marleen&quot;. At 56 years old, Andersen was the oldest performer to have competed in the contest, and held this record until , when 75-year-old Ladislav Demeterffy (also known as 75 Cents) competed for with the group .

== Production and format ==
The contest was organised and broadcast by the French public broadcaster (RTF). served as producer and director, served as cinematographer, Gérard Dubois served as designer, and Franck Pourcel served as musical director, leading forty musicians of the . Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. The event was presented by Jacqueline Joubert, who had also hosted the 1959 contest; Joubert remains one of only three individuals to have presented multiple Eurovision Song Contests, alongside the UK&#x27;s Katie Boyle (1960, , and ) and Sweden&#x27;s Petra Mede (, and ).

Each country, participating through a single EBU member broadcaster, was represented by one song performed by up to two people on stage. The results of the event were determined through jury voting, with each country&#x27;s jury containing ten individuals who each gave one vote to their favourite song, with no abstentions allowed and with jurors unable to vote for their own country. The jury comprised members of the public who represented the average television viewer. Many of the other aspects of the show were however almost identical to the previous contest in Cannes, including the opening film, direction, production and the scoreboard used during the voting process.

The stage design was notably larger than in previous years, featuring a central large staircase covered in flowers, trees and shrubs, with an painted outdoor scene in the background, giving an impression of a Mediterranean garden. Dubois chose the trees to be featured within the stage design with André Racot, the head of the Cannes municipal gardens, making sure that the trees were not too dark when shown on black-and-white television. The original design featured the green room within the stage, with the artists remaining on stage after they had performed, however this idea ultimately did not feature in the final design constructed for the event.

The draw to determine the running order took place on 16 March 1961 at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, conducted by Jacqueline Joubert and assisted by two children aged six and four. The draw also featured interviews with some of the participating acts conducted by Robert Beauvais. Rehearsals commenced in the contest venue on the same day.

== Contest overview ==
The contest was held on 18 March 1961 at 20:00 (CET) and lasted 1 hour and 39 minutes. It was the first time that the contest was staged on a Saturday night, which has since become the traditional day on which the grand final of the contest is staged. The interval act was a dance performance by Tessa Beaumont and titled , with music by Raymond Lefèvre. The prize for the winning artist and songwriters, an engraved medallion, was presented by Tessa Beaumont.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Jacques Datin, written by and performed by the French singer and actor Jean-Claude Pascal. This was the first of an eventual five contest victories that Luxembourg would go on to achieve. The came second for the third consecutive contest, while the placed third.

Although not widely interpreted as such at the time of the contest, it has since become known that the winning song speaks clandestinely of a homosexual relationship: the lyrics refer to a love that is frowned upon by society and forbidden by religion, however the singer hopes that one day their relationship will continue without controversy. Songs of such subject matter would have been considered taboo, and would not have been allowed to be spoken of widely in 1961; same-sex sexual activities were illegal in almost half of the countries competing in the contest at the time, including in Austria, West Germany, the UK and Spain. Therefore, the true meaning of the lyrics was required to be hidden behind subtext and double meanings, an interpretation later affirmed by Pascal, himself a gay man although not publicly out at the time. Given the song was released before the emergence of the modern gay liberation movement, it has since been interpreted as an early protest song in favour of rights for sexual minorities. The song has since been used more visibly to highlight LGBTQ rights, including in a promotional video by the French government to highlight homophobia, biphobia and transphobia.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1961 contest are listed below.
* 
* Michael Aspel

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in reverse order to that which each country performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in performance order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below, with voting countries listed in the order in which they presented their votes.

== Broadcasts ==

Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. Local press reported a total of 14 commentators reporting on the contest, with a total of 16 countries broadcasting the event.

No official accounts of total international viewing figures are known to exist; an estimate given in the French press ahead of the contest suggested there would be 40 million viewers across Europe. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas (born April 7, 1960) is an American former professional boxer who competed between 1981 and 1999. He reigned as undisputed world heavyweight champion in 1990 after knocking out Mike Tyson. He also defeated other heavyweight world champions Oliver McCall, Trevor Berbick, and Greg Page.

Douglas was a 42 to 1 underdog going into his 1990 fight against Tyson. Defying expectations, Douglas would knock out Tyson in the 10th round to claim the WBC, WBA, and IBF titles. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion for eight months until he was defeated by Evander Holyfield in his only title defense. Retiring shortly after the loss, Douglas returned to boxing between 1996 and 1999 until he retired a second and final time.

==Early life==
The son of professional boxer William &quot;Dynamite&quot; Douglas and Lula Pearl Douglas, Douglas grew up in Columbus, Ohio, in the predominantly Black Linden neighborhood of Windsor Terrace. His father ran a gym at the Blackburn Recreation Center near Downtown Columbus and subsequently introduced young James to boxing (in the same way James would later bring his son Lamar to the same gym). He attended Linden McKinley High School, where he played football and basketball, leading Linden to a Class AAA state basketball championship in 1977. After high school, Douglas played basketball for the Coffeyville Community College Red Ravens in Coffeyville, Kansas, from 1977 to 1978; the 17-year-old was a 6&#x27;0&quot; power forward. He is in the Coffeyville Community College Men&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame. He also played basketball at Sinclair Community College from 1979 to 1980 in Dayton, Ohio, before attending Mercyhurst University on a basketball scholarship. He moved back to Columbus to focus on boxing.

==Professional career==

Douglas debuted on May 31, 1981, defeating Dan O&#x27;Malley in a four-round bout. He was managed by former Ohio State University assistant football coach John Johnson. Douglas won his first five fights before coming into a fight with David Bey weighing 20 pounds heavier than he usually had for his previous bouts. Bey handed Douglas his first defeat by knocking him out in the second round. After six more fights, all of which he won, Douglas fought Steffen Tangstad to a draw on October 16, 1982. He was penalized two points during the course of the fight, which proved to be the difference on the judges&#x27; scorecards.

After the draw, Douglas beat largely journeyman fighters for the next 14 months. Two of his wins were knockouts of Jesse Clark, whom Douglas had also stopped in 1981. Douglas needed just seven total rounds of fighting in the three bouts combined to score the three KOs. In his last fight of 1983, Douglas was dominating opponent Mike White, but White knocked him out in the ninth round.

On November 9, 1984, Douglas was scheduled to face heavyweight contender Trevor Berbick in Las Vegas. Berbick withdrew from the bout three days before it was to take place; Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb elected to take the fight on short notice in Berbick&#x27;s stead. Douglas defeated the former heavyweight contender by majority decision. The next year, he fought up-and-coming contender Jesse Ferguson. Douglas fought just three times in 1986, defeating former champion Greg Page and fringe contender David Jaco in two of the bouts. This earned him a shot at the International Boxing Federation championship that was stripped from Michael Spinks for refusing to defend it against Tony Tucker. Douglas started well against Tucker and was ahead on points, but he ran out of stamina and suffered a technical knockout in the tenth round.

After the Tucker defeat and a series of disagreements, James split with his father; the Douglas family was shattered. James started business from scratch and hand-picked another team for himself, particularly a new trainer. This helped him win his next four fights. After the false start in 1984, Douglas finally fought Berbick in 1989, winning a unanimous decision. He followed that up with a unanimous decision victory over future heavyweight champion Oliver McCall, which earned him a shot at Mike Tyson for the undisputed heavyweight championship. Tyson became the universally recognized champion after knocking out Spinks in one round in 1988. (Douglas fought on the undercard of that event, defeating Mike Williams by seventh-round TKO.)

===Undisputed heavyweight champion===

The Tyson fight was scheduled for February 11, 1990 at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo. Almost all observers assumed that the bout would be another quick knockout for the champion; no fighter had taken Tyson beyond the fifth round since 1987. Many thought it was a tune-up for Tyson before a future mega-fight with undefeated Evander Holyfield, who had recently moved up to heavyweight after becoming the first undisputed world cruiserweight champion in the history of that weight class. Douglas&#x27;s chances of lasting deep into the fight against Tyson, let alone winning, were so lightly regarded that only one Las Vegas betting parlor even bothered to establish odds for the fight. That lone casino, the Mirage, made Douglas a 42-to-1 underdog.

Douglas&#x27;s mother, Lula Pearl, died of a stroke 23 days before the title bout at the age of 46. Douglas had promised his mother that he would beat Mike Tyson before she had passed away. Douglas, who had trained hard, surprised the world by dominating the fight from the beginning, using his 12-inch reach advantage to perfection. He seemingly hit Tyson at will with jabs and right hands and danced out of range of Tyson&#x27;s punches. The champion had not taken Douglas seriously, expecting another easy knockout victory just as the overwhelming majority of neutral observers had. He was slow, declining his usual strategy of moving his head and slipping his way inside. Rather, Tyson set his feet and threw big, lunging hooks in efforts to stop Douglas with one punch.

By the fifth round, Tyson&#x27;s left eye was swelling shut from Douglas&#x27;s many right hands and ringside HBO announcers proclaimed it was the most punishment they had ever seen the champion absorb. Larry Merchant memorably added, &quot;Well, if Mike Tyson -- who loves pigeons -- was looking for a pigeon in this bout, he hasn&#x27;t found him.&quot; Tyson&#x27;s cornermen appeared to be unprepared for the suddenly dire situation. They had not brought an endswell or an ice pack to the fight, so they were forced to fill a latex glove with cold tap water and hold it over Tyson&#x27;s swelling eye. The eye would swell almost completely shut by the end of the fight.

In the eighth round, Tyson landed a right uppercut that knocked Douglas down. The referee&#x27;s count created controversy as Douglas was on his feet when the referee reached nine, but the official knockdown timekeeper was two seconds ahead. In the ring, however, the final arbiter of the ten-count is the referee, and a comparison with the count issued to Tyson two rounds later revealed that both fighters had received long counts.

Tyson came out aggressively in the ninth round and continued his attempts to end the fight with one big punch, hoping Douglas was still hurt from the eighth-round knockdown. Both men traded punches before Douglas landed a combination that staggered Tyson back to the ropes. With Tyson hurt and dazed, Douglas unleashed a vicious attack to try to finish him off but, amazingly, Tyson withstood the barrage and barely survived the round.

In the tenth round, the damage Douglas had inflicted upon Tyson finally began to take its toll on the champion. Douglas dominated the round from the outset. While setting Tyson up with his jab, Douglas scored a huge uppercut that snapped Tyson&#x27;s head upward. He followed with a rapid four-punch combination to the head, knocking Tyson down for the first time in the champion&#x27;s career. Tyson struggled to his knees and picked up his mouthpiece, which was lying on the mat next to him. He awkwardly tried to place it back into his mouth. The image of Tyson&#x27;s mouthpiece hanging crookedly from his lips would become an enduring image from the fight. He was unable to beat the referee&#x27;s ten-count, and Douglas was the new world heavyweight champion.

As Douglas said in an interview years later, “I thought Tyson was getting up until I had seen him looking for that mouth piece and then I knew that he was really hurt. So anytime you know you only got ten seconds to get up so you aren’t going to worry about anything but just getting up first. So when I had seen him looking around for that mouth piece I knew he was really hurt.”

Douglas&#x27;s joy over the victory soon turned to confusion and anger as manager John Johnson informed him in the dressing room that Tyson and Don King were lodging an official protest about the referee&#x27;s knockdown count in the eighth round. A week later, during a television interview, Douglas said that the protest and the post-fight confusion ruined what should have been the best time of his life.

===Losing the title===

Although the IBF immediately recognized Douglas as its champion, the WBA and WBC initially refused due to Tyson&#x27;s protest. However, Tyson withdrew his protest four days later amid worldwide public outcry and demands from boxing commissions around the world, and Douglas was officially recognized as undisputed heavyweight champion.

While still champion, Douglas appeared on the February 23, 1990 episode of the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s &quot;The Main Event III&quot;, as special guest referee for a rematch between Hulk Hogan and &quot;Macho King&quot; Randy Savage. Originally, Tyson was scheduled to be the guest referee, but following the upset, the WWF rushed to sign on Douglas for the event. At the end of the match, Douglas was provoked into a kayfabe punch and knockout of Savage, who was the heel wrestler in the match.

The defeated Tyson clamored for a rematch and Douglas was offered more money than he had ever made for a fight. Not wanting to deal with Tyson&#x27;s camp or his promoter Don King, Douglas decided to make his first defense against #1 contender Evander Holyfield, who had watched the new champion dethrone Tyson from ringside in Tokyo. Douglas went into the October 25, 1990 fight at 246 pounds, 15 pounds heavier than he was for the Tyson match and also the heaviest he had weighed in for a fight since a 1985 bout with Dion Simpson, in which he tipped the scale at just over 247 pounds.

Douglas came out rather sluggish, and was thoroughly dominated by Holyfield during the first two rounds. In the third round Douglas attempted to hit Holyfield with a hard uppercut that he telegraphed. Holyfield avoided the uppercut and knocked an off-balance Douglas to the canvas with a straight right to the chin. Douglas merely lay flat on his back, motionless and disoriented, as referee Mills Lane stopped the fight. Buster Douglas retired after that bout.

===Later career===
Douglas vs Holyfield was a reported $24.6 million payday for Douglas. Doing little for the next several years, Douglas gained weight, reaching nearly 400 pounds. It was only after he nearly died during a diabetic coma that he decided to attempt a return to the sport. He went back into training and made a comeback. He was successful at first, winning six straight fights, but his comeback almost came to a halt in a 1997 disqualification win over journeyman Louis Monaco. In a bizarre ending, Monaco landed a right hand, just after the bell ending round one, that knocked Douglas to the canvas. Douglas was unable to continue after a five-minute rest period and was consequently awarded the win by disqualification (on account of Monaco&#x27;s illegal punch).

A fight with light-heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. was touted in the late 1990s, although ultimately fell through. In 1998, having bounced back into a minor stardom, Douglas was knocked out in the first round of a fight with heavyweight contender Lou Savarese, for the lightly regarded IBA heavyweight title. Douglas subsequently had two more fights, winning both, and retired in 1999 with a final record of 38–6–1.

==In the media==

Douglas made a guest appearance in the 1990s cop show &quot;Street Justice&quot;.

Douglas made his feature film acting debut in the Artie Knapp science fiction comedy film &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Plight&quot;.

The 1988 arcade game &quot;Final Blow&quot; was released as &quot;James &#x27;Buster&#x27; Douglas Knockout Boxing&quot; in 1990 for the Master System and Sega Genesis, which replaced one of the fictional fighters with Douglas. This game is considered as a response to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mike Tyson&#x27;s Punch-Out!!&quot;, especially since Tyson lost to Douglas, which Sega took advantage in order to promote their early &quot;Genesis does what Nintendon&#x27;t&quot; advertisements – an advertising campaign in which Douglas frequently participated.

In 1995, HBO aired &quot;Tyson&quot;, a television movie based upon the life of Mike Tyson. Douglas was portrayed by actor Duane Davis.

On February 23, 1990, Douglas made a special appearance as a guest referee on WWF&#x27;s The Main Event III in a match-up between Hulk Hogan and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage. Mike Tyson was originally scheduled to be the special guest referee, but this changed following Douglas&#x27;s knockout title win over Tyson just under two weeks before, on February 11.

Douglas&#x27;s upset against Tyson is the inspiration for The Killers&#x27; song &quot;Tyson vs Douglas&quot; from their &quot;Wonderful Wonderful&quot; album. Singer songwriter Brandon Flowers used the childhood memory of watching the seemingly invincible Tyson lose, as the motivation for a song that&#x27;s about &quot;me and my family, and the way I’m perceived by my kids. I don’t want them to see me go down like Tyson&quot;.

==Personal life==
Douglas married Bertha M. Paige on July 2, 1987. Although Douglas filed for divorce from Paige on April 20, 1990, the couple reconciled and as of 2015 are still married, raising four sons about from his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. Douglas has helped raise money for his hometown, donating $10,000 to the Police Athletic League shortly after his bout with Tyson, and establishing a charitable effort in his own name. As of 2020, Douglas coaches youth boxing at the Thompson Community Center in Columbus. Douglas in 2015 stated that he and Tyson have only met once since their fight, and that Tyson was &quot;still kind of short (with me)&quot;.

==Honors==
Douglas is one of the few non-students to be honored by Ohio State University with the opportunity to dot the &quot;i&quot; during the performance of the Script Ohio by The Ohio State University Marching Band. Douglas was inducted into the Columbus Hall of Fame in 1991, and the Atlantic City Boxing Hall of Fame in 2024.

<doc id="180722" wikidata="Q76897" url="?curid=180722" title="Julius Wellhausen">
<text>Julius Wellhausen (17 May 1844 – 7 January 1918) was a German biblical scholar and orientalist. In the course of his career, his research interest moved from Old Testament research through Islamic studies to New Testament scholarship. Wellhausen contributed to the composition history of the Pentateuch/Torah and studied the formative period of Islam. For the former, he is credited as one of the originators of the documentary hypothesis.

==Biography==
Wellhausen was born at Hamelin in the Kingdom of Hanover. The son of a Protestant pastor, he later studied theology at the University of Göttingen under Georg Heinrich August Ewald and became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; for Old Testament history there in 1870. In 1872, he was appointed professor ordinarius of theology at the University of Greifswald. However, he resigned from the faculty in 1882 for reasons of conscience, stating in his letter of resignation:
He became professor extraordinarius of oriental languages in the faculty of philology at Halle, was elected professor ordinarius at Marburg in 1885 and was transferred to Göttingen in 1892, where he stayed until his death.

Among theologians and biblical scholars, he is best known for his book, &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot; (&quot;Prolegomena to the History of Israel&quot;); his work in Arabic studies (specifically, the magisterial work entitled &quot;The Arab Kingdom and its Fall&quot;) remains celebrated, as well. After a detailed synthesis of existing views on the origins of the first five books of the Bible, Wellhausen aimed at placing the development of these books into a historical and social context. The resulting argument, called the documentary hypothesis, became the dominant model for many biblical scholars and remained so for most of the 20th century.

According to Alan Levenson, Wellhausen considered theological anti-Judaism, as well as antisemitism, to be normative.

==&quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot; and documentary hypothesis==

Wellhausen was famous for his critical investigations into Old Testament history and the composition of the &quot;Hexateuch&quot;. He is perhaps best known for his &quot;Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels&quot; (1883, first published in 1878 as &quot;Geschichte Israels&quot;) in which he advanced a definitive formulation of the documentary hypothesis. It argues that the Torah had its origins in a redaction of four originally-independent texts dating from several centuries after the time of Moses, their traditional author.

Wellhausen&#x27;s hypothesis remained the dominant model for Pentateuchal studies until the last quarter of the 20th century, when it began to be advanced by other biblical scholars who saw more and more hands at work in the Torah and ascribed them to periods even later than Wellhausen had proposed.

Regarding his sources, Wellhausen described Wilhelm de Wette as &quot;the epoch-making opener of the historical criticism of the Pentateuch.&quot; In 1806, De Wette provided an early, coherent mapping of the Old Testament writings of the J, E, D, and P, authors. He was so far ahead of his time, however, that he was soon cast out of his university post. Young Julius Wellhausen largely continued the work of de Wette, and transformed those studies into historical monuments.

==Other works==

<text>Hermann Sudermann (30 September 1857 – 21 November 1928) was a German dramatist and novelist.

== Life ==

=== Early career ===
Sudermann was born at Matzicken, a village to the east of Heydekrug in the Province of Prussia (now Macikai, in southwestern Lithuania), close to the Russian frontier. The Sudermanns were a Mennonite family from the Vistula delta Mennonite communities near the former Elbing, East Prussia, (now Elbląg, Poland).

His father owned a small brewery in Heydekrug, and Sudermann received his early education at the &quot;Realschule&quot; in Elbing, where he lived with his relatives and attended the Mennonite church where his uncle was the minister. His parents having been reduced in circumstances, he was apprenticed to a chemist at the age of 14. He was, however, able to enter the &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; (high school) in Tilsit, and to study philosophy and history at Königsberg University.

In order to complete his studies Sudermann went to Berlin, where he was tutor to several families, including the family of the author Hans Hopfen (1835–1904). Next he became a journalist, and was in 1881 and 1882 the co-editor of the &quot;Deutsches Reichsblatt&quot;. He then devoted himself to fiction, beginning with a collection of naturalistic short stories called &quot;Im Zwielicht&quot; (&quot;At Twilight&quot;, 1886), and the novels &quot;Frau Sorge&quot; (&quot;Dame Care&quot;, 1887), &quot;Geschwister&quot; (&quot;Siblings&quot;, 1888) and &quot;Der Katzensteg&quot; (&quot;Cats&#x27; Bridge&quot;, 1890). These works failed to bring the young author as much recognition as his first drama, &quot;Die Ehre&quot; (&quot;Honour&quot;, 1889), which inaugurated a new period in the history of the German stage. This play, originally intended to be a tragedy, but on Blumenthal&#x27;s advice given a &quot;happy ending,&quot; was a pseudo-Nietzschean attack on the morality of the lowly.

He married the novelist Clara Lauckner (1861–1924), née Schulz on 20 October 1891 and lived with his family in Berlin-Wannsee. She was a widow and already had three children from her previous short-lived marriage, and she then had one child with Sudermann: a daughter, Hede. They lived in Königsberg for the next two years, before moving to Dresden and then Berlin in 1895.

=== Fame ===
He had a large following in Japan. During the 20th century, his plays were the basis of more than 30 films.

&quot;Heimat&quot; (1893), another successful drama, was translated into English as &quot;Magda&quot; (1896). In this play, Sudermann emphasizes the right of the artist to a freer moral life than that of the petty bourgeoisie. It has some of the moralistic and didactic tendency of the later French dramatists, especially the younger Dumas, and all of their technical finesse. Productions featured some of the best known actresses of the time, including Helena Modjeska, Sarah Bernhardt, Eleonora Duse, and Mrs Patrick Campbell.

In 1894 Sudermann returned to novels with &quot;Es War&quot; (the title referring to Section 2, §1 of Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Unzeitgemässe Betrachtungen&quot;), a protest against the fruitlessness of brooding repentance. In 1902, he moved to a mansion with extensive grounds at Blankensee, and used his new-found wealth to collect paintings and sculpture, and to take trips to Italy, Greece, Egypt and India.

At the commencement of World War I, Sudermann was enthusiastic, publishing a &quot;Kaiserlied&quot; (&quot;Song of the Kaiser&quot;). In autumn 1917, he organised the &quot;Frohe Abende&quot; (&quot;Cheery Evenings&quot;), a program promoting artistic endeavors among the common people, for which he received an Iron Cross Second Class on 5 April 1918. After the end of the war, he helped found the &quot;Bund schaffender Künstler&quot; (&quot;Society of Creative Artists&quot;), which posed as a centrist political force and which earned him the reputation of an opportunist.

The most important of his later works are &quot;Litauische Geschichten&quot; (&quot;Lithuanian Stories&quot;, 1917, translated as &quot;The Excursion to Tilsit&quot;), a realistic portrait of his homeland, and a volume of memoirs in 1922. His last major work, written after the death of his wife in 1924, was &quot;Die Frau des Steffen Tromholt&quot; (&quot;The Wife of Steffen Tromholt&quot;, 1927), a semi-autobiographical novel, which turned into a movie in 1929 titled &quot;Wonder of Women&quot;. He had a stroke in 1928, and died of a lung infection shortly afterwards, in Berlin, aged 71. His stepson Rolf Lauckner set up the Hermann Sudermann Foundation to support young dramatists.

=== Posthumous reputation ===
Sudermann&#x27;s nationalism, and his delight in romanticized ideas of ethnicity and homeland, particularly noticeable in his later works, made him a favorite during World War II. Jürgen Fehling staged &quot;Johannisfeuer&quot; in Berlin, with Maria Gorvin, Maria Koppenhöfer and Paul Wegener in the lead roles. The film &quot;Die Reise nach Tilsit&quot; was based on his short story of the same title.

After 1945, his plays and novels were almost completely forgotten. He mainly is remembered today for his Lithuanian stories, for his autobiography, and for the 1927 silent films &quot;&quot;, based on his short story &quot;Die Reise nach Tilsit&quot; (&quot;The Excursion to Tilsit&quot;), from the Collection &quot;Litauische Geschichten&quot; (&quot;Lithuanian Stories&quot;), &quot;The Song of Songs&quot;, starring Marlene Dietrich, based on his novel &quot;Das Hohe Lied&quot; and &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot;, starring Greta Garbo, based on his novel &quot;The Undying Past&quot;.
