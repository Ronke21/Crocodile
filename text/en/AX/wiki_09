<text>Mazandaran province (; ) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. Its capital is the city of Sari. Located along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea and in the adjacent Central Alborz mountain range and Hyrcanian forests, it is bordered clockwise by Russia (across the sea), Golestan, Semnan, Tehran, Alborz, Qazvin, and Gilan Provinces. Mazandaran, founded in 1937, covers an area of 23,842 km2.

The province has diverse natural resources, notably large offshore reservoirs of oil and natural gas. The diverse natural habitats of the province include plains, prairies, forests and rainforest stretching from the sandy beaches of the Caspian Sea to the rugged and snowcapped Alborz sierra, including Mount Damavand, one of the highest peaks and volcanoes in Asia.

Mazandaran is a major producer of farmed fish, and aquaculture provides an important economic addition to traditional dominance of agriculture. Another important contributor to the economy is the tourism industry, as people from all of Iran enjoy visiting the area. Mazandaran is also a fast-growing centre for biotechnology.

== Etymology ==

Literally &quot;the gate or the valley of the giants&quot; from مازن‎ (mâzan) + در‎ (dar) + ـان‎ (ân), from Avesta (). The name has been used in Shahnameh to refer to a land inhabited by divs or (daevas) and sorcerers and is difficult to conquer.

In Mazandaran, there are places named Div Asiyab, Div Cheshmeh, Div Kela, Div Hamam, etc.

== History ==

Human habitation in the area dates back at least 75,000 years. Recent excavations in Gohar Tape in Rostamkola provide proof that the area has been urbanized for more than 5,000 years, and the area is considered one of the most important historical sites of Iran. It has played an important role in cultural and urban development of the region. 

Indigenous peoples of the region include the ethnic Mazanderanis, who speak an Iranian language which most closely resembles Gilaki and Sangiseri language, but also has phono-typical similarities to several Caucasian languages, reflecting the history of the region and its peoples.

In the early 20th century, Reza Shah connected northern Elbourz to the southern slopes by constructing seven new roads and railways, the provinces of Mazandaran and Gilan became known as Shomal by all Iranians (meaning &quot;the North&quot; in Persian).
Mazandaran province was made part of the Region 1 upon the division of the provinces into five regions solely for coordination and development purposes on June 22, 2014.

=== Pre-Islamic history ===

Before the arrival of the Iranian-speakers to Iran, native people of this area were subsistence hunters and cattle herders. Archaeological studies in caves belt and Hutu man in Behshahr in the Mazandaran date to &quot;ca.&quot; 9500 BCE. The Amard were a tribe living along the mountainous region bordering the Caspian Sea, including current day Amol. Tapuri were a tribe in the Medes south of the Caspian Sea mentioned by Ptolemy and Arrian. Ctesias refers to the land of Tapuri between the two lands of Cadusii and Hyrcania.

The territory known as Mazandaran has changed hands among various dynasties from early in its history. There are several fortresses remaining from the Parthian Empire and Sasanian Empire, and many older cemeteries scattered throughout the province. During this era, Mazandaran was part of Hyrcania, which was one of the important provinces.

In 662 CE, ten years after the death of Yazdegerd III, the last Sasanian emperor, a large Muslim army under the command of Hassan ibn Ali invaded Tabarestan.

With the advent of the Sasanian Empire, the King of Mazandaran (Tabaristan and Padashkhwargar) was Gushnasp, whose ancestors had reigned in the area (under the Parthian empire) since the time of Alexander the Great. In 529–536, Mazandaran was ruled by the Sasanian prince Kawus, son of Kawadh. Anushirawan, the Sasanian king, defeated Zarmihr, who claimed his ancestry from the legendary blacksmith Kaveh. This dynasty ruled the area till 645 AD, when Gil Gilanshah (a descendant of the Sasanian king Jamasp and a grandson of Piruz) joined Mazandaran to Gilan.

In 651 the Sasanid Empire fell, and all of the Sasanid domains gradually came under Arab control, except for the Caspian region of Iran (among which Tabaristan).

=== Islamic history ===
Tabaristan maintained an existence independent of the Umayyad Caliphate which supplanted the Sasanian Empire in the early seventh century, with independent Zoroastrian houses like the Bavand and Karen fighting an effective guerilla warfare against the Ummayads. A short-lived Alid Shiite state collapsed before the subsequent take-over by the Ziyarid princes. During the post-Islamic period the local dynasties fell into three classes: local families of pre-Islamic origin; the ʿAlid sayyid; and local families of secondary importance.

The Karinids claimed descent from Karin, brother of Zarmihr who was the pre-Islamic ruler under the Sasanians. Their last representative Mazyar was put to death in 839.

In the 9th-11th century AD, there were repetitively military raids undertaken by the Rus&#x27; between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Dagestan as part of the Caspian expeditions of the Rus&#x27;. Initially, the Rus&#x27; appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids took place in the late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus&#x27; undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged the westernmost parts of Gorgan as well as Mazandaran and Gilan, taking slaves and goods.
The Bavandids, who claimed descent from Kawus, provided three dynasties. The first dynasty (665–1007) was overthrown on the conquest of Tabaristan by the Ziyarid Kabus b. Wushmgir. The second dynasty reigned from 1073 to 1210, when Mazandaran was conquered by &#x27;Ala al-Din Muhammad Khwarzamshah. The third ruled from 1237 to 1349 as vassals of the Mongols. The last representative of the Bavandids was killed by Afrasiyab Chulawi.

The Paduspanids claimed descent from the Dabuyids of the north. They came to prominence around 660 and during the rule of the ʿAlids were their vassals. Later, they were vassals of the Buyids and Bavandids, who deposed them in 1190. The dynasty, restored in 1209–10, survived until the time of Timur; the branch, claiming descent from Kawus the son of Kayumarth reigned until 1567 and the other, that of Iskandar the son of Kayumarth, until 1574.

In the Safavid era (1501–1736) Mazandaran was settled by very large numbers of Georgians, Circassians, Armenians, and other Peoples of the Caucasus, whose descendants still live or linger across Mazandaran. Towns, villages and neighbourhoods in Mazandaran still bear the name &quot;Gorji&quot; (i.e., Georgian) in them, although most of the large amounts of Georgians, Armenians, and Circassians are already assimilated into the mainstream Mazandaranis. The history of Georgian settlement is described by Iskandar Beg Munshi, the author of the 17th century Tarikh-e Alam-Ara-ye Abbasi, and both the Circassian and Georgian settlements by Pietro Della Valle, among other authors.

Tabaristan remained independent until 1596, when Shah Abbas I, Mazandarani on his mother&#x27;s side, incorporated Mazandaran into his Safavid empire, forcing many Armenians Circassians, Georgians, to settle in Mazandaran. Pietro della Valle (1586–1652), who visited a town near Firuzkuh in Mazandaran, noted that Mazandarani women never wore the veil and didn&#x27;t hesitate to talk to foreigners. He also noted the extremely large amount of Circassians and Georgians in the region, and that he had never encountered people with as much civility as the Mazandaranis.

=== Post-Safavid period ===
After the Safavid period, the Qajars began to campaign south from Mazandaran with Agha Mohammad Khan who already incorporated Mazandaran into his empire in 1782. On 21 March 1782, Agha Mohammad Shah proclaimed Sari as his imperial capital. Mazandaran was the site of local wars in those years, which led to the transfer of the capital from Sari to Tehran by Fath Ali Shah. In Modern era at Mazandaran make new house and bridge in Amol and Sari. In along the beach and in the forest built Villa and modern settlements.

Before the reign of Nader Shah, the province was briefly occupied by the Russian army in the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War (1722–23) and returned to Persia in 1735. Following the outcomes of the Russo-Persian War (1804–13) and the Russo-Persian War (1826–28) northern Iran, especially Mazandaran and Gilan, as well as, to a certain extent, Tehran, fell under a growing Russian sphere of influence.

In the 19th century, during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, the verdant region of Mazandaran was paid due attention as a recreational area.

The top provincial official referred to the existence of three international airports and three major sea ports in the province and the visit of millions of Iranian and foreign tourists to Mazandaran, including health tourists.

== Demographics ==
=== Language and ethnicity ===
The population of the province has been steadily growing during the last 50 years. The following table shows the approximate province population, excluding the Golestan province, which has separated as an independent province in 1998.

The population is overwhelmingly Mazandarani, with a minority of Gilaks, Azerbaijanis, Kurds, Georgians, Armenians, Circassians, Turkmen and others.

Mazandarani people have a background in Tabari ethnicity and speak Mazandarni. Their origin goes back to Tapuri people. So their land was called Tapuria, the land of Tapuris. Tapuris were made to migrate to the south coast of the Caspian Sea during the Achaemenid dynasty.

The native people of Sari, Amol, Qaem Shahr, Babol, Nowshahr, Chalus, and Tonekabon are Mazandarani people and speak the Mazandarani language.

The eastern Gīlakī dialect is spoken in the entire valley of the Čālūs river, though Kurdish tribes were established in the yeylāq of Kojūr and Kalārdašt in the Qajar period. Today Kurds in Mazandaran are mostly known as Khajevand Kurds and form majority of the cities of Kelardasht, Abbasabad, Nowshahr, Chalus and Kajur. Other Kurdish tribes in Mazandaran Province are Modanlu (In Sari), Jahanbeiglou (In Sari), Abdolmaleki (In Behshahr), Jalalvand (In Ramsar) and Amarlu (In Tonekabon).

The Mazandarani inhabit the majority of the province. The closely related Gilak form the largest minority and are concentrated in Ramsar, Tonekabon.

In recent years the region has seen an influx of Iranians from other regions of Iran, many of them attracted by its nature and seaside.

Mazanderani or &quot;Tabari&quot; is a Northwestern Iranian language. Various Mazandarani dialects exist which are spoken in Mazandaran province and the neighboring Golestan province such as Mazanderani, and Gorgani and possibly Qadikolahi (Ghadikolahi) and Palani. Today, Mazandaranis also use Persian (Western Persian). The educated can communicate and read Persian well.

The people residing in Chalus speak Mazanderani language. The dialect of Kalarestaqi is spoken in the west of Chalus and the dialect of Kojuri in the east.

The people residing in Nowshahr speak the Kojuri-dialect of Mazanderani language.

The closely related Gilaks form the largest minority in Mazandaran. They speak the Gilaki language and are concentrated in Ramsar, and Tonekabon. The native people in Ramsar are Gilaks although there are also Mazandarani people living there. They speak the Gilaki language although the style they speak has been influenced by the Mazandarani language, making it slightly different from the Gilaki spoken in Gilan. (Planhol, p. 38).

A dialect of Azeri is spoken in the town of Galoogah.

== Geography ==

Mazandaran is located on the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. It is bordered clockwise by Golestan, Semnan and Tehran provinces. This province also borders Qazvin and Gilan to the west.

Mazandaran province is geographically divided into two parts: the coastal plains, and the mountainous areas. The Alborz Mountain Range surrounds the coastal strip and the plains abutting the Caspian Sea like a huge wall. Due to the prevailing sea breeze and local winds of the southern and eastern coasts of the Caspian Sea, sandy hills are formed, causing the appearance of a low natural barrier between the sea and plain.
There is often snowfall in the Alborz regions, which run parallel to the Caspian Sea&#x27;s southern coast, dividing the province into many isolated valleys. The province enjoys a moderate, subtropical climate with an average temperature of 25 °C in summer and about 8 °C in winter. Although snow may fall heavily in the mountains in winter, it rarely falls at sea level.
Ecoregions:
* Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests
* Elburz Range forest steppe
The total wood production from these forests is estimated at . Golestan National Park and Shastkolateh forest watershed are located in Golestan Province and Mazandaran Province (the total area of the Hyrcanian forest is estimated at . From these forests, are used commercially, are protected and the rest are regarded as forest lands or over-used forests. The total of the forest woods used in this province is estimated at . The Kojoor, Dohezar and Sehezar forest watersheds are located in Mazandaran Province.
The Elburz Range forest steppe ecoregion is an arid, mountainous 1,000-kilometer arc south of the Caspian Sea, stretching across northern Iran from the Azerbaijan border to near the Turkmenistan border. It covers and encompasses the southern and eastern slopes of the Alborz Mountains as well as their summits. The Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests ecoregion, with its lush green mountainsides and plains that receive moisture from the Caspian Sea, forms this ecoregion&#x27;s northern border. The vast Central Persian desert basin ecoregion forms its southern border. The Alborz range is composed of a granite core overlain with sedimentary rock including limestones, shales, sandstones, and tuffs. Metamorphic rocks such as schists, marbles, and amphibolite are also widely found. The climate is arid with annual precipitation varying from 150 mm to 500 mm, falling mostly as winter snow.

=== Environment ===
The now-extinct Caspian tiger and the Caspian horse are two of the animals of Mazandaran province.

The 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat was held in Mazandaran in the city of Ramsar.
Unlike the rest of Iran, Mazandaran is watered by numerous rivers, or mountain torrents, all running from the mountains to the sea. The German traveller Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin, who visited this country in 1771, says that in the space of eight miles, on the road from Resht to Amot, 250 of such streams are to be seen, many of them being so exceedingly broad and deep, that the passage across is sometimes impracticable for weeks together.

=== Climate ===

Mazandaran Province naturally comes under the influence of the geographical latitude, the Alborz mountain range, elevation from sea level, distance from the sea, and the southern barren areas of Turkmenistan, local and regional air currents, and versatile vegetation cover. These conditions result in the climatic division of the province into three types:

== Governance ==
Mazandaran has 9 electoral fields and a total of 12 seats in the Islamic Consultative Assembly.

== Transportation ==
=== Railway ===

Mazandaran is served by the North Railway Dept. of the Iranian Railways. The department connects the province to Tehran to the south and Gorgan to the east. The cities of Sari, Qaemshahr, and Pol-e Sefid are major stations of the department.
The Trans-Iranian Railway was a major railway building project started in 1927 and completed in 1938, under the direction of the Iranian monarch, Reza Shah, and entirely with indigenous capital. It links the capital Tehran with the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea.

The Mazandaran train station is the city&#x27;s first modern rail station and it dates from the Pahlavi dynasty.

=== Roads ===
Mazandaran is connected to Tehran by Haraz road (Amol-Rudehen), Kandovan road (Chalus-Karaj), and Firoozkooh road (Savadkuh).

=== Airports ===
Dasht-e Naz Airport, serving the capital Sari, Noshahr Airport, and Ramsar International Airport are the domestic airports that connect the province to the other parts of the country.

== Culture ==

=== In literature ===
In the Persian epic, Shahnameh, Mazandaran is mentioned in two different sections. The first mention is implicit, when Fereydun sets its capital in a city called Tamishe near Amol:

بیاراست گیتی بسان بهشت... به جای گیا سرو گلبن بکشت

از آمل گذر سوی تمیشه کرد ... نشست اندر آن نامور بیشه کرد

And when Manuchehr is returning to Fereydun&#x27;s capital, Tamisheh in Mazandaran (known as Tabarestan), after his victory over Salm and Tur.

In the second section, a region called Mazandaran is mentioned in the Kai Kavoos era; it is an area which is mostly inhabited by Div (demons). The legendary Iranian Shah Kaykavoos, as well as the Iranian hero Rostam, each take turn to go to Mazandaran in order to battle the demons.

In a verse from Shahnameh, Zal tells Kai Kavoos: &quot;I heard troubling news that the king is planning to go to Mazandaran&quot;.

However, this Mazandaran is not considered identical to the modern province of Mazandaran, and is instead a land to the west of Iran. The current province was simply considered a part of Tabaristan; the name Mazandaran is a later development, perhaps based upon local terminology.

In Gaston Leroux&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, one of the characters was formerly the daroga (chief of police) of Mazanderan.

=== Nowruz ===
The Tabarian New Year, or Neowrez, occurs in the &quot;pintek&quot; days of the Tabarian Calendar. In the Mazandarani language of Iran in the Mazanderani calendar, the year is divided into 12 thirty-day months and one pentad of days, often beginning on March 21. Neowrez Khani is one of the strongest and most popular traditions of the Mazanderani people.

=== Ceremonies and events ===
Tirgan is a mid-summer Iranian festival, celebrated annually on Tir 13 (July 3, 4, or 5). It is performed by splashing water, dancing, reciting poetry, and serving traditional foods such as spinach soup and shole-zard. The custom of tying rainbow-colored bands on wrists, which are worn for ten days and then thrown into a stream, is also a way to rejoice for children.
Other famous events like, Varf chal, traditional ceremony with almost 800 years old as one of the unique rituals of Mazandaran associated with water was held in the village of Ab Ask and Lochu Wrestling game in different time.

=== Music and dance ===
Music in this region relates to the lifestyle of the inhabitants, and the melodies revolve around issues such as the forests, cultivation or farming activities and herding. The most famous dance of this area is the Shomali dance, not forgetting the stick dance that the men perform. Popular music in the province, known as the Taleb and Zohre, Amiri Khani and Katuli.

=== Cuisine ===
The cuisine of the province is very rich in seafood due to its location by the Caspian Sea, and rice is present in virtually every meal. Mazandarani cuisine is diverse between regions; the cuisine of coastal regions is different from mountainous regions, as people in the Alborz usually use the indigenous herbs and coastal people use the dishes of fish and Caspian Mazandaran rice with vegetables.

== Tourism ==
Over 15 million Iranian and some 400,000 foreign tourists visit the province annually. More than 800 registered historical and cultural sites, 338 kilometers of shorelines, mineral springs in jungles and mountains, waterfalls, and caves are among the major tourism attractions in the Mazandaran province.
Mazandaran has been picked as the tourism capital of Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) members states in 2022.

<text>Psychological testing refers to the administration of psychological tests. Psychological tests are administered or scored by trained evaluators. A person&#x27;s responses are evaluated according to carefully prescribed guidelines. Scores are thought to reflect individual or group differences in the construct the test purports to measure. The science behind psychological testing is psychometrics.

== Psychological tests ==
According to Anastasi and Urbina, psychological tests involve observations made on a &quot;carefully chosen &quot;sample&quot; [emphasis authors] of an individual&#x27;s behavior.&quot; A psychological test is often designed to measure unobserved constructs, also known as latent variables. Psychological tests can include a series of tasks, problems to solve, and characteristics (e.g., behaviors, symptoms) the presence of which the respondent affirms/denies to varying degrees. Psychological tests can include questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaire- and interview-based scales typically differ from psychoeducational tests, which ask for a respondent&#x27;s maximum performance. Questionnaire- and interview-based scales, by contrast, ask for the respondent&#x27;s typical behavior. Symptom and attitude tests are more often called scales. A useful psychological test/scale must be both valid, i.e., show evidence that the test or scale measures what it is purported to measure,) and reliable, i.e., show evidence of consistency across items and raters and over time, etc.

It is important that people who are equal on the measured construct (e.g., mathematics ability, depression) have an approximately equal probability of answering a test item accurately or acknowledging the presence of a symptom. An example of an item on a mathematics test that might be used in the United Kingdom but not the United States could be the following: &quot;In a football match two players get a red card; how many players are left on the pitch?&quot; This item requires knowledge of football (soccer) to be answered correctly, not just mathematical ability. Thus, group membership can influence the probability of correctly answering items, as encapsulated in the concept of differential item functioning. Often tests are constructed for a specific population and the nature of that population should be taken into account when administering tests outside that population. A test should be invariant between relevant subgroups (e.g., demographic groups) within a larger population. For example, for a test to be used in the United Kingdom, the test and its items should have approximately the same meaning for British males and females. That invariance does not necessarily apply to similar groups in another population, such as males and females in the United States or between populations, for example, the populations of the UK and the US. In test construction, it is important to establish invariance at least for the subgroups of the population of interest.

Psychological assessment is similar to psychological testing but usually involves a more comprehensive assessment of the individual. According to the American Psychological Association, psychological assessment involves the collection and integration of data for the purpose of evaluating an individual’s &quot;behavior, abilities, and other characteristics.&quot; Each assessment is a process that involves integrating information from multiple sources, such as personality inventories, ability tests, symptom scales, interest inventories, and attitude scales, as well as information from personal interviews. Collateral information can also be collected from occupational records or medical histories; information can also be obtained from parents, spouses, teachers, friends, or past therapists or physicians. One or more &quot;psychological tests&quot; are sources of information used within the process of assessment. Many psychologists conduct assessments when providing services. Psychological assessment is a complex, detailed, in-depth process. Examples of assessments include providing a diagnosis, identifying a learning disability in schoolchildren, determining if a defendant is mentally competent, and selecting job applicants.

==History==
The first large-scale tests may have been part of the imperial examination system in China. The tests, an early form of psychological testing, assessed candidates based on their proficiency in topics such as civil law and fiscal policies. Early tests of intelligence were made for entertainment rather than analysis. Modern mental testing began in France in the 19th century. It contributed to identifying individuals with intellectual disabilities for the purpose of humanely providing them with an alternative form of education.

Englishman Francis Galton coined the terms psychometrics and eugenics. He developed a method for measuring intelligence based on nonverbal sensory-motor tests. The test was initially popular but was abandoned. In 1905 French psychologists Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon published the &quot;Échelle métrique de l&#x27;Intelligence&quot; (Metric Scale of Intelligence), known in English-speaking countries as the Binet–Simon test. The test focused heavily on verbal ability. Binet and Simon intended that the test be used to aid in identifying schoolchildren who were intellectually challenged, which in turn would pave the way for providing the children with professional help. The Binet-Simon test became the foundation for the later-developed Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales.

The origins of personality testing date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, when phrenology was the basis for assessing personality characteristics. Phrenology, a pseudoscience, involved assessing personality by way of skull measurement. Early pseudoscientific techniques eventually gave way to empirical methods. One of the earliest modern personality tests was the Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, a self-report inventory developed during World War I to be used by the United States Army for the purpose of screening potential soldiers for mental health problems and identifying victims of shell shock (the instrument was completed too late to be used for the purposes it was designed for). The Woodworth Inventory, however, became the forerunner of many later personality tests and scales.

==Principles==
The development of a psychological test requires careful research. Some of the elements of test development involve the following:
:* &quot;Standardization&quot; - All procedures and steps must be conducted with consistency from one testing site/testing occasion to another. Examiner subjectivity is minimized (see objectivity next). Major standardized tests are normed on large try-out samples in order to understand what constitutes high, low, and intermediate scores.
:* &quot;Objectivity&quot; - Scoring such that subjective judgments and biases are minimized; scores are obtained in a similar manner for every test taker (see below).
:* &quot;Discrimination&quot; - Scores on a test should discriminate members of extreme groups; for example, each subscale of the original MMPI distinguished hospitalized patients suffering from mental illness and members of a well comparison group.
:* &quot;Test Norms&quot; - Part of the standardization of large-scale tests (see above). Norms help psychologists learn about individual differences. For example, a normed personality scale can help psychologists understand how some people are high in negative affectivity (NA) and others are low or intermediate in NA. With many psychoeducational tests, test norms allow educators and psychologists obtain an age- or grade-referenced percentile rank, for example, in reading achievement.
:* &quot;Reliability&quot; - Refers to test or scale consistency. It is important that individuals score about the same if they take a test and an alternate form of the test or if they take the same test twice, within a short time window. Reliability also refers to response consistency from test item to test item.
:* &quot;Validity&quot; - Refers to evidence that demonstrates that a test or scale measures what it is purported to measure.

=== Sample of behavior ===
The term &quot;sample of behavior&quot; refers to an individual&#x27;s performance on tasks that have usually been prescribed beforehand. For example, a spelling test for middle school students cannot include all the words in the vocabularies of middle schoolers because there are thousands of words in their lexicon; a middle school spelling test must include only a sample of words in their vocabulary. The samples of behavior must be reasonably representative of the behavior in question. The samples of behavior that make up a paper-and-pencil test, the most common type of psychological test, are written into the test items. Total performance on the items produces a test score. A score on a well-constructed test is believed to reflect a psychological construct such as achievement in a school subject like vocabulary or mathematics knowledge, cognitive ability, dimensions of personality such as introversion/extraversion, etc. Differences in test scores are thought to reflect individual differences in the construct the test is purported to measure.

==Types==
There are several broad categories of psychological tests:

=== Achievement tests ===

Achievement tests assess an individual&#x27;s knowledge in a subject domain. Some academic achievement tests are designed to be administered by a trained evaluator. By contrast, group achievement tests are often administered by a teacher. A score on an achievement test is believed to reflect the individual&#x27;s knowledge of a subject area.

There are generally two types of achievement tests, norm-referenced and criterion-referenced tests. Most achievement tests are norm-referenced. The individual&#x27;s responses are scored according to standardized protocols and the results can be compared to the results of a norming group. Norm-referenced tests can be used to underline individual differences, that is to say, to compare each test-taker to every other test-taker. By contrast, the purpose of criterion referenced achievement tests is ascertain whether the test-taker mastered a predetermined body of knowledge rather than to compare the test-taker to everyone else who took the test. These types of tests are often a component of a mastery-based classroom.

The Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement is an example of an individually administered achievement test for students.

=== Aptitude tests ===

Psychological tests have been designed to measure abilities, both specific (e.g., clerical skill like the Minnesota Clerical Test) and general abilities (e.g., traditional IQ tests such as the Stanford-Binet or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale). A widely used, but brief, aptitude test used in business is the Wonderlic Test. Aptitude tests have been used in assessing specific abilities or the general ability of potential new employees (the Wonderlic was once used by the NFL). Aptitude tests have also been used for career guidance.

Evidence suggests that aptitude tests like IQ tests are sensitive to past learning and are not pure measures of untutored ability. The SAT, which used to be called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, had its named changed because performance on the test is sensitive to training.

=== Attitude scales ===

An attitude scale assesses an individual&#x27;s disposition regarding an event (e.g., a Supreme Court decision), person (e.g., a governor), concept (e.g., wearing face masks during a pandemic), organization (e.g., the Boy Scouts), or object (e.g., nuclear weapons) on a unidimensional favorable-unfavorable attitude continuum. Attitude scales are used in marketing to determine individuals&#x27; preferences for brands. Historically social psychologists have developed attitude scales to assess individuals&#x27; attitudes toward the United Nations and race relations. Typically Likert scales are used in attitude research. Historically, the Thurstone scale was used prior to the development of the Likert scale. The Likert scale has largely supplanted the Thurstone scale.

=== Biographical Information Blank ===
The Biographical Information Blanks or BIB is a paper-and-pencil form that includes items that ask about detailed personal and work history. It is used to aid in the hiring of employees by matching the backgrounds of individuals to requirements of the job.

=== Clinical tests ===

The purpose of clinical tests is to assess the presence of symptoms of psychopathology . Examples of clinical assessments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-IV, Child Behavior Checklist, Symptom Checklist 90 and the Beck Depression Inventory.

Many large-scale clinical tests are normed. For example, scores on the MMPI are rescaled such that 50 is the middlemost score on the MMPI Depression scale and 60 is a score that places the individual one standard deviation above the mean for depressive symptoms; 40 represents a symptom level that is one standard deviation below the mean.

=== Criterion-referenced ===
A criterion-referenced test is an achievement test in a specific knowledge domain. An individual&#x27;s performance on the test is compared to a criterion. Test-takers are not compared to each other. A passing score, i.e., the criterion performance, is established by the teacher or an educational institution. Criterion-referenced tests are part and parcel of mastery based education.

===Direct observation===

Psychological assessment can involve the observation of people as they engage in activities. This type of assessment is usually conducted with families in a laboratory or at home. Sometimes the observation can involve children in a classroom or the schoolyard. The purpose may be clinical, such as to establish a pre-intervention baseline of a child&#x27;s hyperactive or aggressive classroom behaviors or to observe the nature of parent-child interaction in order to understand a relational disorder. Time sampling methods are also part of direct observational research. The reliability of observers in direct observational research can be evaluated using Cohen&#x27;s kappa.
The Parent-Child Interaction Assessment-II (PCIA) is an example of a direct observation procedure that is used with school-age children and parents. The parents and children are video recorded playing at a make-believe zoo. The Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment is used to study parents and young children and involves a feeding and a puzzle task. The MacArthur Story Stem Battery (MSSB) is used to elicit narratives from children. The Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System-II tracks the extent to which children follow the commands of parents and &quot;vice versa&quot; and is well suited to the study of children with Oppositional Defiant Disorders and their parents.

=== Interest inventories ===
Psychological tests include interest inventories. These tests are used primarily for career counseling. Interest inventories include items that ask about the preferred activities and interests of people seeking career counseling. The rationale is that if the individual&#x27;s activities and interests are similar to the modal pattern of activities and interests of people who are successful in a given occupation, then the chances are high that the individual would find satisfaction in that occupation. A widely used instrument is the Strong Interest Inventory, which is used in career assessment, career counseling, and educational guidance.

=== Neuropsychological tests ===
Neuropsychological tests are designed to assess behaviors that are linked to brain structure and function. An examiner, following strict pre-set procedures, administers the test to a single person in a quiet room largely free of distractions. An example of a widely-used neuropsychological test is the Stroop test.

=== Norm-referenced tests ===

Items on norm-referenced tests have been tried out on a norming group and scores on the test can be classified as high, medium, or low and the gradations in between. These tests allow for the study of individual differences. Scores on norm-referenced achievement tests are associated with percentile ranks vis-á-vis other individuals who are the test-taker&#x27;s age or grade.

=== Personality tests ===
Personality tests assess constructs that are thought to be the constituents of personality. Examples of personality constructs include traits in the Big Five, such as introversion-extroversion and conscientiousness. Personality constructs are thought to be dimensional. Personality measures are used in research and in the selection of employees. They include self-report and observer-report scales. Examples of norm-referenced personality tests include the NEO-PI, the 16PF Questionnaire, the Occupational Personality Questionnaires, and the Five-Factor Personality Inventory.

The International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) scales assess the same traits that the NEO and other personality scales assess. All IPIP scales and items are in the public domain and, therefore, are available free of charge.

=== Projective tests ===

Projective testing originated in the first half of the 1900s. The idea animating projective tests is that the examinee is thought to project hidden aspects of his or her personality, including unconscious content, onto the ambiguous stimuli presented in the test. Examples of projective tests include Rorschach test, Thematic apperception test, and the Draw-A-Person test. Available evidence, however, suggests that projective tests have limited validity.

=== Public safety employment tests ===
Vocations within the public safety field (e.g., fire service, law enforcement, corrections, emergency medical services) are often required to take industrial or organizational psychological tests for initial employment and promotion. The National Firefighter Selection Inventory, the National Criminal Justice Officer Selection Inventory, and the Integrity Inventory are prominent examples of these tests.

==Sources of psychological tests==
Thousands of psychological tests have been developed. Some were produced by commercial testing companies that charge for their use. Others have been developed by researchers, and can be found in the academic research literature. Tests to assess specific psychological constructs can be found by conducting a database search. Some databases are open access, for example, Google Scholar (although many tests found in the Google Scholar database are not free of charge). Other databases are proprietary, for example, PsycINFO, but are available through university libraries and many public libraries (e.g., the Brooklyn Public Library and the New York Public Library).

There are online archives available that contain tests on various topics.

:*APA PsycTests. Requires subscription
:*Mental Measurements Yearbook- a non-profit that provides independent reviews of thousands of distinct psychological tests. 
:*Assessment Psychology Online has links to dozens of tests for clinical assessment.
:*International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) contains items to assess more than 100 personality traits including Five Factor Model.
:*Organization of Work: Measurement Tools for Research and Practice. NIOSH site devoted to Occupational Health and Safety

==Test security==
Many psychological and psychoeducational tests are not available to the public. Test publishers put restrictions on who has access to the test. Psychology licensing boards also restrict access to the tests used in licensing psychologists. Test publishers hold that both copyright and professional ethics require them to protect the tests. Publishers sell tests only to people who have proved their educational and professional qualifications. Purchasers are legally bound not to give test answers or the tests themselves to members of the public unless permitted by the publisher.

The International Test Commission (ITC), an international association of national psychological societies and test publishers, publishes the &quot;International Guidelines for Test Use&quot;, which prescribes measures to take to &quot;protect the integrity&quot; of the tests by not publicly describing test techniques and by not &quot;coaching individuals&quot; so that they &quot;might unfairly influence their test performance.&quot;

<text>The Parni (; , &quot;Parnoi&quot;), Aparni (; Ἄπαρνοι, &quot;Aparnoi&quot;) or Parnians were an East Iranian people who lived around the Ochus ( &quot;Okhos&quot;) (Tejen) River, southeast of the Caspian Sea. It is believed that their original homeland may have been what is now southern Russia, from where they emigrated with other Scythian tribes. The Parni were one of the three tribes of the Dahae confederacy. 

In the middle of the 3rd century BCE, the Parni invaded Parthia, &quot;drove away the Greek satraps, who had then only just acquired independence, and founded a new dynasty&quot;, that of the Arsacids.

==Historical identity and location==
There is no unambiguous evidence of the Parni in native Iranian language sources,&quot;cf.&quot; and all references to these people come from Greek and Latin accounts. In these accounts, which are not necessarily contemporaneous, it is difficult to unambiguously identify references to the Parni due to inconsistency of Greek/Latin naming and transliteration, and/or the similarity to names of other tribes such as the Sparni or Apartani and the Eparnoi or Asparioi. It may also be that the Parni are related to one or more of these other tribes, and that &quot;their original homeland may have been southern Russia from where they emigrated with other Scythian tribes.&quot;

The location of the Parni Dahae immediately south-east of the Caspian Sea was derived from by Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; (Book 11, 1st century BCE). The ethnonym of the Dahae was the root of the later placename Dahestan or Dihistan – a region straddling the present regions of Turkmenistan and Iran. So little is known of the Dahae, including the Parni, that – in the words of A. D. H. Bivar – even the location and name of their capital city &quot;if indeed they possessed one&quot; is unknown. A later archaeological site in the region, known as Dehistan/Mishrian, is located in the Balkan Region of Turkmenistan.

==Language==
The language of the Parni is not directly attested but is assumed to be one of the eastern substrates of the subsequently recorded Parthian language, which the Parni eventually adopted. To the &quot;incoming Parni may be ascribed a form of speech showing a strong east Iranian element, resulting from their proximity on the steppe to east Iranian Sakas.&quot; Through the influence of the Parthians in Armenia, traces of the Parni language survive as &quot;loan-words in Armenian.&quot;

The language of the Parni &quot;was described by Justin as &#x27;midway between Scythian and Median [and] contained features of both&#x27;&quot; (41.1.10). Justin&#x27;s late (3rd century) opinion is &quot;no doubt slightly exaggerated,&quot; and is in any case of questionable veracity given the ambiguity of names.

==Rise to prominence==

In 247 BCE, Andragoras, the Seleucid governor (satrap) of Parthia (&quot;roughly western Khurasan&quot;) proclaimed independence from the Seleucids, when—following the death of Antiochus II—Ptolemy III seized control of the Seleucid capital at Antioch, and &quot;so left the future of the Seleucid dynasty for a moment in question.&quot;

Meanwhile, &quot;a man called Arsaces, of Scythian or Bactrian origin, [was] elected leader of the Parni tribes.&quot; Following the secession of Parthia from the Seleucid Empire and the resultant loss of Seleucid military support, Andragoras had difficulty in maintaining his borders, and about 238 BCE—under the command of &quot;Arsaces and his brother Tiridates&quot;—the Parni invaded Parthia and seized control of Astabene (Astawa), the northern region of that territory, the administrative capital of which was Kabuchan (Kuchan in the vulgate).

A short while later, the Parni seized the rest of Parthia from Andragoras, killing him in the process. Although an initial punitive expedition by the Seleucids under Seleucus II was not successful, the Seleucids under Antiochus III recaptured Arsacid-controlled territory following the Battle of Mount Labus in 209 BCE from Arsaces&#x27; (or Tiridates&#x27;) successor, Arsaces II. Arsaces II sued for peace and accepted vassal status, and it was not until Arsaces II&#x27;s grandson (or grand-nephew) Phraates I, that the Arsacids/Parni would again begin to assert their independence.

For the historiographers upon whose documentation the reconstruction of early Arsacid history depends, the Parni had by then become indistinguishable from the Parthians.

==Legacy==
The seizure of Astabene in 238 BCE nominally marks the beginning of the Arsacid era, which is named after Arsaces, and the name adopted by all Parthian kings. The Arsacid dynasts laid claim to descent from Artaxerxes II. Beginning from Astabene and Parthia (which would subsequently be extended southwards to include much of present-day Sistan), the Arsacids gradually subjugated many of the neighboring kingdoms, most of which were thereafter controlled as vassalries. Beginning with the successful revolt - in 224 CE - of an erstwhile vassal of Stakhr named Ardashir (in Greek again &quot;Arsaces&quot;/&quot;Artaxerxes&quot;), the Arsacid/Parthian hegemony began to yield to a Sassanid/Persian one.

The name &quot;Parni&quot; reappears in Sassanid-era documents to identify one of the seven Parthian feudal families allied with the Sassanid court. However, this family is not attested from Arsacid times, and the claim to the &quot;Parni&quot; name is (like four of the six other families) &quot;in all probability not in accordance with reality.&quot; &quot;It may be that [...] members of them made up their own genealogies in order to emphasize the antiquity of their families.&quot;

It has been suggested that the Parnau Hills (&quot;Paran Koh&quot;) bear the name of the Parni.

==Notes==

* a Arsaces was &quot;perhaps originally a local ruler in Bactria.&quot;
* b The origins of the Arsacids lineage are based on the historiography of later Greeks and Romans; the fact remains that the Arsacids used Greek titles and Greek inscriptions on their coins, which were also styled after the Seleucid coins. While Wolski (1937/1938) supported that the story of the two brothers may even be fiction, their coins are real, and they are considered to be historical personae and that Tiridates (I) succeeded his brother Arsaces (I), although he took on the Arsaces name at his coronation, a not-unusual practice in that era. Some have also questioned the relationship between Tiridates I (a.k.a. Arsaces II) and his son and successor Arsaces II (a.k.a. Artabanus I). For example, Bivar has rejected the genealogies proposed by Frye and Chaumont &amp; Bickermann.
* cIn linguistics and philology, the expression &#x27;Parnian&#x27; is sometimes used as a term of convenience to collectively denote eastern Iranian influences evident in the (western Iranian) Parthian language. Because the language of the Parni is not actually attested, it is not possible to determine whether there is actually a specific correlation between the language of the Parni and that of the east Iranian element in Parthian.

<text>Joseph Warton (April 1722 – 23 February 1800) was an English clergyman, academic, and literary critic.

==Early life and education==
Warton was born in Dunsfold, Surrey, England. His family later moved to Hampshire, where his father, the Reverend Thomas Warton, became vicar of Basingstoke. A few years later in Basingstoke, Joseph&#x27;s sister Jane, also a writer, and his younger brother, Thomas Warton, were born. Their father later became a professor at the University of Oxford.

Joseph was educated at Winchester College and at Oriel College, Oxford.

==Career==

In 1748, Warton followed his father into the church, becoming curate of Winslade. In 1754, he was instituted as rector at The Church of All Saints, Tunworth. In his early days Joseph wrote poetry, of which the most notable piece is &quot;The Enthusiast&quot; (1744), an early precursor of Romanticism. 

In 1755, he returned to his old school to teach, and from 1766 to 1793 was its headmaster, presiding over a period of bad discipline and idleness, provoking three mutinies by the boys. His career as a critic was always more illustrious, and he produced editions of classical poets such as Virgil as well as English poets including John Dryden. 

Like his brother, Warton was a friend of Samuel Johnson, and was part of the literary coterie centered around publisher Robert Dodsley.

A monument to Joseph Warton by the neoclassical sculptor John Flaxman is in Winchester Cathedral.

*&quot;The Enthusiast, or The Lover of Nature&quot; (1744)
*&quot;Odes on Various Subjects&quot; (1746)

<doc id="176858" wikidata="Q1365766" url="?curid=176858" title="Walter Camp">
<text>Walter Chauncey Camp (April 7, 1859 – March 14, 1925) was an American college football player and coach, and sports writer known as the &quot;Father of American Football&quot;. Among a long list of inventions, he created the sport&#x27;s line of scrimmage and the system of downs. With John Heisman, Amos Alonzo Stagg, Pop Warner, Fielding H. Yost, and George Halas, Camp was one of the most accomplished persons in the early history of American football. He attended Yale College, where he played and coached college football. Camp&#x27;s Yale teams of 1888, 1891, and 1892 have been recognized as national champions. Camp was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach during 1951.

Camp wrote articles and books on the gridiron and sports in general, annually publishing an &quot;All-American&quot; team. By the time of his death, he had written nearly 30 books and more than 250 magazine articles.

The annual Walter Camp Award is named in his honor, recognizing the best all-around collegiate football player.

==Life==
Camp was born in New Britain, Connecticut, the son of Leverett Camp and Ellen Sophia (Cornwell) Camp. Walter Camp was of English descent. His first immigrant ancestor was the English colonist Nicholas Camp, who came from Nazeing, Essex, England and arrived in colonial New England in 1630, arriving first in Massachusetts and then moving to Connecticut that same year. Walter attended Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, entered Yale College in 1875, and graduated in 1880. At Yale he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity, the Linonian Society, and Skull and Bones. He attended Yale Medical School from 1880 to 1883, where his studies were interrupted first by an outbreak of typhoid fever and then by work for the Manhattan Watch Company. Camp worked for the New Haven Clock Company beginning in 1883, working his way up to chairman of the board of directors.

===Playing career===
In 1873, Camp attended a meeting where representatives from Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, and Yale universities created the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA). The representatives created the rule that each team is only allowed 15 plays per drive. Camp played as a halfback at Yale from 1876 to 1882. His primary sports were baseball and rugby football before it developed into American football. Harvard player Nathaniel Curtis took one look at Camp, then only 156 pounds, and told Yale captain Gene Baker &quot;You don&#x27;t mean to let that child play, do you? ... He will get hurt.&quot;

===Family===
On June 30, 1888, Camp married Alice Graham Sumner, sister of sociologist William Graham Sumner. They had two children: Walter Camp Jr. (1891–1940), who attended Yale as well and was elected as a member of Scroll and Key in 1912, and Janet Camp Troxell (1897–1987). Camp is buried with his wife and children in Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven. He was an Episcopalian.

===Coaching career===
Camp served as the head football coach at Yale from 1888 to 1892. In his time with Yale, the team won 67 games and lost just 2 games. He then moved on to Stanford University, where he coached in December 1892 and in 1894 and 1895. On Christmas Day, 1894, Amos Alonzo Stagg and his University of Chicago Maroons defeated Camp&#x27;s Stanford team 24–4 at San Francisco in an early intersectional contest.

==Father of American football==

Camp was on the various collegiate football rules committees that developed the American game from his time as a player at Yale until his death. English rugby football rules at the time required a tackled player, when the ball was &quot;fairly held,&quot; to put the ball down immediately for scrummage. Camp proposed at the U.S. College Football 1880 rules convention that the contested scrum be replaced with a &quot;line of scrimmage&quot; where the team with the ball started with uncontested possession and with each team fielding eleven players. This change effectively created the evolution of the modern game of American football from its rugby football origins, and was on display in the first game of football between two American colleges played with this format, Harvard and Tufts on June 4, 1875.

He is credited with innovations such as the snap-back from center, the system of downs, and the points system as well as the introduction of what became a standard offensive arrangement of players—a seven-man line and a four-man backfield consisting of a quarterback, two halfbacks, and a fullback. Camp was also responsible for introducing the &quot;safety,&quot; the awarding of two points to the defensive side for tackling a ball carrier in his own end zone followed by a free kick by the offense from its own 20-yard line to restart play. This is significant as rugby union has no point value award for this action, but instead awards a scrum to the attacking side five meters from the goal line.

In 2011, reviewing Camp&#x27;s role in the founding of the sport and of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Taylor Branch also credited Camp with cutting the number of players on a football team from 15 to 11 and adding measuring lines to the field. However, Branch noted that the revelation in a contemporaneous &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; magazine story of &quot;Camp&#x27;s $100,000 slush fund,&quot; along with concern about the violence of the growing sport, helped lead to President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s intervention in the sport. The NCAA emerged from the national talks, but worked to Yale&#x27;s disadvantage relative to rival (and Roosevelt&#x27;s alma mater) Harvard University, according to Branch.

==Writing==
Despite having a full-time job at the New Haven Clock Company, a Camp family business, and being an unpaid yet very involved adviser to the Yale football team, Camp wrote articles and books on the gridiron and sports in general. By the time of his death, he had written nearly 30 books and more than 250 magazine articles. His articles appeared in national periodicals such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Outing&quot;, &quot;Outlook&quot;, and &quot;The Independent&quot;, and in juvenile magazines such as &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;, &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, and &quot;Boys&#x27; Magazine&quot;. His stories also appeared in major daily newspapers throughout the United States. He also selected an annual &quot;All-American&quot; team.

By the age of 33, twelve years after graduating from Yale, Walter Camp had already become known as the &quot;Father of Football.&quot; In a column in the popular magazine &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, sports columnist Caspar Whitney had applied the nickname; the sobriquet was appropriate because, by 1892, Camp had almost single-handedly fashioned the game of modern American football.

Camp was editor for several sports books published by the Spalding Athletic Library.

===Eastern bias===

The dominance of Ivy League players on Camp&#x27;s All-America teams led to criticism over the years that his selections were biased against players from the leading Western universities, including Chicago, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Notre Dame. Many selectors picked only Eastern players. For example, Wilton S. Farnsworth&#x27;s 1910 All-American eleven for the &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; was made up of five players from Harvard, two from West Point, and one each from Yale, Princeton, Penn, and Brown.

The selectors were typically Eastern writers and former players who attended only games in the East. In December 1910, &quot;The Mansfield News&quot;, an Ohio newspaper, ran an article headlined: &quot;All-American Teams of East Are Jokes: Critics Who Never Saw Western Teams Play to Name Best in Country -- Forget About Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois.&quot; The article noted: 

==The Daily Dozen exercise regimen==
Camp was a proponent of exercise, and not just for the athletes he coached. While working as an adviser to the United States military during World War I, he devised a program to help servicemen become more physically fit.
Walter Camp has just developed for the Naval of setting up exercises that seems to fill the bill; a system designed to give a man a running jump start for the serious work of the day. It is called the &quot;daily dozen set-up&quot;, meaning thereby twelve very simple exercises.
Both the Army and the Navy used Camp&#x27;s methods.

The names of the exercises in the original Daily Dozen, as the whole set became known, were hands, grind, crawl, wave, hips, grate, curl, weave, head, grasp, crouch, and wing. As the name indicates, there were twelve exercises, and they could be completed in about eight minutes. A prolific writer, Camp wrote a book explaining the exercises and extolling their benefits. During the 1920s, a number of newspapers and magazines used the term &quot;Daily Dozen&quot; to refer to exercise in general.

Starting in 1921 with the &quot;Musical Health Builder&quot; record sets, Camp began offering morning setting-up exercises to a wider market. In 1922, the initiative reached the new medium of radio.

==Death and legacy==
Camp died of a heart attack on March 14, 1925, in New York City.

Football historian Timothy P. Brown wrote of Camp nearly a century after his death:

:&quot;For his many contributions, he is rightfully known as the father of American football. But saying Walter Camp is the father of American football is to understate his influence during the first fifty years of the game. Camp was the voice of college football to the nation when print was the only medium. He was widely published and syndicated. He was the football authority as a pioneering player, coach, and rule maker. He was Knute Rockne, Grantland Rice, Bud Wilkinson, Vince Lombardi, Paul Zimmerman, and Bill Belichick all rolled into one. His thinking and influence on football, for good and for bad, cannot be underestimated.&quot;

<text>The Saka were a group of nomadic Eastern Iranian peoples who lived in the Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin from the 9th century BC to the 5th century AD. The Saka were closely related to the Scythians, and both groups formed part of the wider Scythian cultures. However, they are distinguished from the Scythians by their specific geographical and cultural traits. The Saka languages formed part of the Scythian phylum, a branch of the Eastern Iranian languages.

Derived from the earlier Andronovo, Sintashta and Srubnaya cultures, the Saka were later influenced by the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Culture and Iron Age East Asian genetic influx. The ancient Persians, ancient Greeks, and ancient Babylonians respectively used the names &quot;Saka,&quot; &quot;Scythian,&quot; and &quot;Cimmerian&quot; for all the steppe nomads. However, the name &quot;Saka&quot; is used specifically for the ancient nomads of the eastern steppe, while &quot;Scythian&quot; is used for the related group of nomads living in the western steppe.

Prominent archaeological remains of the Sakas include Arzhan, Tunnug, the Pazyryk burials, the Issyk kurgan, Saka Kurgan tombs, the Barrows of Tasmola and possibly Tillya Tepe. In the 2nd century BC, many Sakas were driven by the Yuezhi from the steppe into Sogdia and Bactria and then to the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, where they were known as the Indo-Scythians. Other Sakas invaded the Parthian Empire, eventually settling in Sistan, while others may have migrated to the Dian Kingdom in Yunnan, China. In the Tarim Basin and Taklamakan Desert of today&#x27;s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, they settled in Khotan, Yarkand, Kashgar and other places.

== Name ==
===Etymology===

Linguist Oswald Szemerényi studied synonyms of various origins for &quot;Scythian&quot; and differentiated the following terms: , , , and .

Derived from an Iranian verbal root , &quot;go, roam&quot; (related to &quot;seek&quot;) and thus meaning &quot;nomad&quot; was the term , from which came the names:
* Old Persian: , used by the ancient Persians to designate all nomads of the Eurasian steppe, including the Pontic Scythians
* Ancient Greek: 
* Latin: 
* Sanskrit: 
* Old Chinese: 

From the Indo-European root &#x27;, meaning &quot;propel, shoot&quot; (and from which was also derived the English word ), of which &#x27; is the zero-grade form, was descended the Scythians&#x27; self-name reconstructed by Szemerényi as (roughly &quot;archer&quot;). From this were descended the following exonyms:
* Akkadian: and , used by the Assyrians
* Old Persian: 
* Ancient Greek: (plural ), used by the Ancient Greeks
:*The Old Armenian: is based on itacistic Greek

A late Scythian sound change from /δ/ to /l/ resulted in the evolution of into . From this was derived the Greek word , which, according to Herodotus, was the self-designation of the Royal Scythians. Other sound changes have produced  .

Although the Scythians, Saka and Cimmerians were closely related nomadic Iranic peoples, and the ancient Babylonians, ancient Persians and ancient Greeks respectively used the names &quot;Cimmerian,&quot; &quot;Saka,&quot; and &quot;Scythian&quot; for all the steppe nomads, and early modern historians such as Edward Gibbon used the term Scythian to refer to a variety of nomadic and semi-nomadic peoples across the Eurasian Steppe,

* the name &quot;Scythian&quot; in contemporary modern scholarship generally refers to the nomadic Iranic people who from the 7th century BC to the 3rd century BC dominated the steppe and forest-steppe zones to the north of the Black Sea, Crimea, the Kuban valley, as well as the Taman and Kerch peninsulas,
* while the name &quot;Saka&quot; is used specifically for their eastern members who inhabited the northern and eastern Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin;

===Identification===
The name was used by the ancient Persian to refer to all the Iranian nomadic tribes living to the north of their empire, including both those who lived between the Caspian Sea and the Hungry steppe, and those who lived to the north of the Danube and the Black Sea. The Assyrians meanwhile called these nomads the Ishkuzai (Akkadian: ) or Askuzai (Akkadian: , , ), and the Ancient Greeks called them Skuthai (Ancient Greek: , , ).

The Achaemenid inscriptions initially listed a single group of . However, following Darius I&#x27;s campaign of 520 to 518 BC against the Asian nomads, they were differentiated into two groups, both living in Central Asia to the east of the Caspian Sea:
* the  () – &quot; who wear pointed caps,&quot; who were also known as the .
* the  () – interpreted as &quot; who lay hauma (around the fire)&quot;, which can be interpreted as &quot;Saka who revere hauma.&quot;

A third name was added after the Darius&#x27;s campaign north of the Danube:
* the  () – &quot;the who live beyond the (Black) Sea,&quot; who were the Pontic Scythians of the East European steppes

An additional term is found in two inscriptions elsewhere:
* the () – &quot;Saka who are beyond Sogdia&quot;, a term was used by Darius for the people who formed the north-eastern limits of his empire at the opposite end to the satrapy of Kush (the Ethiopians). These have been suggested to have been the same people as the 

Moreover, Darius the Great&#x27;s Suez Inscriptions mention two groups of Saka:
* the () – &quot; of the Marshes&quot;
* the () – &quot; of the Land&quot;

The scholar David Bivar had tentatively identified the with the , and John Manuel Cook had tentatively identified the with the . More recently, the scholar Rüdiger Schmitt has suggested that the and the might have collectively designated the /Massagetae.

The Achaemenid king Xerxes I listed the Saka coupled with the  () people of Central Asia, who might possibly have been identical with the .

=== Modern terminology ===

Although the ancient Persians, ancient Greeks, and ancient Babylonians respectively used the names &quot;Saka,&quot; &quot;Scythian,&quot; and &quot;Cimmerian&quot; for all the steppe nomads, modern scholars now use the term Saka to refer specifically to Iranian peoples who inhabited the northern and eastern Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin; and while the Cimmerians were often described by contemporaries as culturally Scythian, they may have differed ethnically from the Scythians proper, to whom the Cimmerians were related, and who also displaced and replaced the Cimmerians.

==Location==

The and both lived in the steppe and highland areas located in northern Central Asia and to the east of the Caspian Sea.

The /Massagetae more specifically lived around Chorasmia and in the lowlands of Central Asia located to the east of the Caspian Sea and the south-east of the Aral Sea, in the Kyzylkum Desert and the Ustyurt Plateau, most especially between the Araxes and Iaxartes rivers. The /Massagetae could also be found in the Caspian Steppe. The imprecise description of where the Massagetae lived by ancient authors has however led modern scholars to ascribe to them various locations, such as the Oxus delta, the Iaxartes delta, between the Caspian and Aral seas or further to the north or northeast, but without basing these suggestions on any conclusive arguments. Other locations assigned to the Massagetae include the area corresponding to modern-day Turkmenistan.

The lived around the Pamir Mountains and the Ferghana Valley.

The , who may have been identical with the , lived on the north-east border of the Achaemenid Empire on the Iaxartes river.

Some other Saka groups lived to the east of the Pamir Mountains and to the north of the Iaxartes river, as well as in the regions corresponding to modern-day Qirghizia, Tian Shan, Altai, Tuva, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Kazakhstan.

The , that is the Saka who were in contact with the Chinese, inhabited the Ili and Chu valleys of modern Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, which was called the &quot;land of the &quot;, i.e. &quot;land of the Saka&quot;, in the &quot;Book of Han&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

The Scythian/Saka cultures emerged on the Eurasian Steppe at the dawn of the Iron Age in the early 1st millennium BC. Their origins has long been a source of debate among archaeologists. The Pontic–Caspian steppe was initially thought to have been their place of origin, until the Soviet archaeologist Aleksey Terenozhkin suggested a Central Asian origin.

Archaeological evidence now tends to suggest that the origins of Scythian culture, characterized by its kurgans (a type of burial mound) and its &quot;Animal style&quot; of the 1st millennium BC, are to be found among Eastern Scythians rather than their Western counterparts: eastern kurgans are older than western ones (such as the Altai kurgan Arzhan 1 in Tuva), and elements of the &quot;Animal style&quot; are first attested in areas of the Yenisei river and modern-day China in the 10th century BC. Genetic evidence corroborates archaeological findings, suggesting an initial eastwards expansion of Western Steppe Herders towards the Altai region and Western Mongolia, spreading Iranian languages, and subsequent contact episodes with local Siberian and Eastern Asian populations, giving rise to the initial (Eastern) Scythian material cultures (Saka). It was however also found that the various later Scythian sub-groups of the Eurasian Steppe had local origins; different Scythian groups arose locally through cultural adaption, rather than via migration patterns from East-to-West or West-to-East.

The Sakas spoke a language belonging to the Iranian branch of the Indo-European languages. The Pazyryk burials of the Pazyryk culture in the Ukok Plateau in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC are thought to be of Saka chieftains. These burials show striking similarities with the earlier Tarim mummies at Gumugou. The Issyk kurgan of south-eastern Kazakhstan, and the Ordos culture of the Ordos Plateau has also been connected with the Saka. It has been suggested that the ruling elite of the Xiongnu was of Saka origin, or at least significantly influenced by their Eastern Iranian neighbours. Some scholars contend that in the 8th century BC, a Saka raid from the Altai may be &quot;connected&quot; with a raid on Zhou China.

=== Early history ===

The Saka are attested in historical and archaeological records dating to around the 8th century BC.

The Saka tribe of the Massagetae/ rose to power in the 8th to 7th centuries BC, when they migrated from the east into Central Asia, from where they expelled the Scythians, another nomadic Iranian tribe to whom they were closely related, after which they came to occupy large areas of the region beginning in the 6th century BC. The Massagetae forcing the Early Scythians to the west across the Araxes river and into the Caucasian and Pontic steppes started a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian Steppe, following which the Scythians displaced the Cimmerians and the Agathyrsi, who were also nomadic Iranian peoples closely related to the Massagetae and the Scythians, conquered their territories, and invaded Western Asia, where their presence had an important role in the history of the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt, and Iran.

During the 7th century BC itself, Saka presence started appearing in the Tarim Basin region.

According to the ancient Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, the Parthians rebelled against the Medes during the reign of Cyaxares, after which the Parthians put their country and capital city under the protection of the Sakas. This was followed by a long war opposing the Medes to the Saka, the latter of whom were led by the queen Zarinaea. At the end of this war, the Parthians accepted Median rule, and the Saka and the Medes made peace.

According to the Greek historian Ctesias, once the Persian Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s founder, Cyrus, had overthrown his grandfather the Median king Astyages, the Bactrians accepted him as the heir of Astyages and submitted to him, after which he founded the city of Cyropolis on the Iaxartes river as well as seven fortresses to protect the northern frontier of his empire against the Saka. Cyrus then attacked the , initially defeated them and captured their king, Amorges. After this, Amorges&#x27;s queen, Sparethra, defeated Cyrus with a large army of both men and women warriors and captured Parmises, the brother-in-law of Cyrus and the brother of his wife Amytis, as well as Parmises&#x27;s three sons, whom Sparethra exchanged in return for her husband, after which Cyrus and Amorges became allies, and Amorges helped Cyrus conquer Lydia.

Cyrus, accompanied by the of his ally Amorges, later carried out a campaign against the Massagetae/ in 530 BC. According to Herodotus, Cyrus captured a Massagetaean camp by ruse, after which the Massagetae queen Tomyris led the tribe&#x27;s main force against the Persians, defeated them, and placed the severed head of Cyrus in a sack full of blood. Some versions of the records of the death of Cyrus named the Derbices, rather than the Massagetae, as the tribe against whom Cyrus died in battle, because the Derbices were a member tribe of the Massagetae confederation or identical with the whole of the Massagetae. After Cyrus had been mortally wounded by the Derbices/Massagetae, Amorges and his army helped the Persian soldiers defeat them. Cyrus told his sons to respect their own mother as well as Amorges above everyone else before dying.

Possibly shortly before the 520s BC, the Saka expanded into the valleys of the Ili and Chu in eastern Central Asia. Around 30 Saka tombs in the form of kurgans (burial mounds) have also been found in the Tian Shan area dated to between 550 and 250 BC.

Darius I waged wars against the eastern Sakas during a campaign of 520 to 518 BC where, according to his inscription at Behistun, he conquered the Massagetae/, captured their king Skunxa, and replaced him with a ruler who was loyal to Achaemenid rule. The territories of the Saka were absorbed into the Achaemenid Empire as part of Chorasmia that included much of the territory between the Oxus and the Iaxartes rivers, and the Saka then supplied the Achaemenid army with a large number of mounted bowmen. According to Polyaenus, Darius fought against three armies led by three kings, respectively named Sacesphares, Amorges or Homarges, and Thamyris, with Polyaenus&#x27;s account being based on accurate Persian historical records. After Darius&#x27;s administrative reforms of the Achaemenid Empire, the were included within the same tax district as the Medes.

During the period of Achaemenid rule, Central Asia was in contact with Saka populations who were themselves in contact with China.

After Alexander the Great conquered the Achaemenid Empire, the Saka resisted his incursions into Central Asia.

At least by the late 2nd century BC, the Sakas had founded states in the Tarim Basin.

=== Kingdoms in the Tarim Basin ===
==== Kingdom of Khotan ====
The Kingdom of Khotan was a Saka city state on the southern edge of the Tarim Basin. As a consequence of the Han–Xiongnu War spanning from 133 BC to 89 AD, the Tarim Basin (now Xinjiang, Northwest China), including Khotan and Kashgar, fell under Han Chinese influence, beginning with the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC).
Archaeological evidence and documents from Khotan and other sites in the Tarim Basin provided information on the language spoken by the Saka.
The official language of Khotan was initially Gandhari Prakrit written in Kharosthi, and coins from Khotan dated to the 1st century bear dual inscriptions in Chinese and Gandhari Prakrit, indicating links of Khotan to both India and China. Surviving documents however suggest that an Iranian language was used by the people of the kingdom for a long time. Third-century AD documents in Prakrit from nearby Shanshan record the title for the king of Khotan as &quot;hinajha&quot; (i.e. &quot;generalissimo&quot;), a distinctively Iranian-based word equivalent to the Sanskrit title &quot;senapati&quot;, yet nearly identical to the Khotanese Saka &quot;hīnāysa&quot; attested in later Khotanese documents. This, along with the fact that the king&#x27;s recorded regnal periods were given as the Khotanese &quot;kṣuṇa&quot;, &quot;implies an established connection between the Iranian inhabitants and the royal power,&quot; according to the Professor of Iranian Studies Ronald E. Emmerick. He contended that Khotanese-Saka-language royal rescripts of Khotan dated to the 10th century &quot;makes it likely that the ruler of Khotan was a speaker of Iranian.&quot; Furthermore, he argued that the early form of the name of Khotan, &quot;hvatana&quot;, is connected semantically with the name Saka.

The region once again came under Chinese suzerainty with the campaigns of conquest by Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626–649). From the late eighth to ninth centuries, the region changed hands between the rival Tang and Tibetan Empires. However, by the early 11th century the region fell to the Muslim Turkic peoples of the Kara-Khanid Khanate, which led to both the Turkification of the region as well as its conversion from Buddhism to Islam.
Later Khotanese-Saka-language documents, ranging from medical texts to Buddhist literature, have been found in Khotan and Tumshuq (northeast of Kashgar). Similar documents in the Khotanese-Saka language dating mostly to the 10th century have been found in the Dunhuang manuscripts.

Although the ancient Chinese had called Khotan &quot;Yutian&quot; (于闐), another more native Iranian name occasionally used was &quot;Jusadanna&quot; (瞿薩旦那), derived from Indo-Iranian &quot;Gostan&quot; and &quot;Gostana&quot;, the names of the town and region around it, respectively.

==== Shule Kingdom ====

Much like the neighboring people of the Kingdom of Khotan, the people of Kashgar, the capital of Shule, spoke Saka, one of the Eastern Iranian languages. According to the &quot;Book of Han&quot;, the Saka split and formed several states in the region. These Saka states may include two states to the northwest of Kashgar, Tumshuq to its northeast, and Tushkurgan south in the Pamirs. Kashgar also conquered other states such as Yarkand and Kucha during the Han dynasty, but in its later history, Kashgar was controlled by various empires, including Tang China, before it became part of the Turkic Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 10th century. In the 11th century, according to Mahmud al-Kashgari, some non-Turkic languages like Kanchaki and Sogdian were still used in some areas in the vicinity of Kashgar, and Kanchaki is thought to belong to the Saka language group. It is believed that the Tarim Basin was linguistically Turkified before the 11th century ended.

=== Southern migrations ===

The Saka were pushed out of the Ili and Chu River valleys by the Yuezhi. An account of the movement of these people is given in Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;. The Yuehzhi, who originally lived between Tängri Tagh (Tian Shan) and Dunhuang of Gansu, China, were assaulted and forced to flee from the Hexi Corridor of Gansu by the forces of the Xiongnu ruler Modu Chanyu, who conquered the area in 177–176 BC. In turn the Yuehzhi were responsible for attacking and pushing the Sai (&quot;i.e.&quot; Saka) west into Sogdiana, where, between 140 and 130 BC, the latter crossed the Syr Darya into Bactria. The Saka also moved southwards toward the Pamirs and northern India, where they settled in Kashmir, and eastward, to settle in some of the oasis-states of Tarim Basin sites, like Yanqi (焉耆, Karasahr) and Qiuci (龜茲, Kucha). The Yuehzhi, themselves under attacks from another nomadic tribe, the Wusun, in 133–132 BC, moved, again, from the Ili and Chu valleys, and occupied the country of Daxia, (大夏, &quot;Bactria&quot;).

The ancient Greco-Roman geographer Strabo noted that the four tribes that took down the Bactrians in the Greek and Roman account – the &quot;Asioi&quot;, &quot;Pasianoi&quot;, &quot;Tokharoi&quot; and &quot;Sakaraulai&quot; – came from land north of the Syr Darya where the Ili and Chu valleys are located. Identification of these four tribes varies, but &quot;Sakaraulai&quot; may indicate an ancient Saka tribe, the &quot;Tokharoi&quot; is possibly the Yuezhi, and while the Asioi had been proposed to be groups such as the Wusun or Alans.
René Grousset wrote of the migration of the Saka: &quot;the Saka, under pressure from the Yueh-chih [Yuezhi], overran Sogdiana and then Bactria, there taking the place of the Greeks.&quot; Then, &quot;Thrust back in the south by the Yueh-chih,&quot; the Saka occupied &quot;the Saka country, Sakastana, whence the modern Persian Seistan.&quot; Some of the Saka fleeing the Yuezhi attacked the Parthian Empire, where they defeated and killed the kings Phraates II and Artabanus. These Sakas were eventually settled by Mithridates II in what become known as Sakastan. According to Harold Walter Bailey, the territory of Drangiana (now in Afghanistan and Pakistan) became known as &quot;Land of the Sakas&quot;, and was called Sakastāna in the Persian language of contemporary Iran, in Armenian as Sakastan, with similar equivalents in Pahlavi, Greek, Sogdian, Syriac, Arabic, and the Middle Persian tongue used in Turfan, Xinjiang, China. This is attested in a contemporary Kharosthi inscription found on the Mathura lion capital belonging to the Saka kingdom of the Indo-Scythians (200 BC – 400 AD) in North India, roughly the same time the Chinese record that the Saka had invaded and settled the country of &quot;Jibin&quot; 罽賓 (i.e. Kashmir, of modern-day India and Pakistan).

Iaroslav Lebedynsky and Victor H. Mair speculate that some Sakas may also have migrated to the area of Yunnan in southern China following their expulsion by the Yuezhi. Excavations of the prehistoric art of the Dian Kingdom of Yunnan have revealed hunting scenes of Caucasoid horsemen in Central Asian clothing. The scenes depicted on these drums sometimes represent these horsemen practising hunting. Animal scenes of felines attacking oxen are also at times reminiscent of Scythian art both in theme and in composition.
Migrations of the 2nd and 1st century BC have left traces in Sogdia and Bactria, but they cannot firmly be attributed to the Saka, similarly with the sites of Sirkap and Taxila in ancient India. The rich graves at Tillya Tepe in Afghanistan are seen as part of a population affected by the Saka.

The Shakya clan of India, to which Gautama Buddha, called &quot;Śākyamuni&quot; &quot;Sage of the Shakyas&quot;, belonged, were also likely Sakas, as Michael Witzel and Christopher I. Beckwith have alleged. The scholar Bryan Levman however criticised this hypothesis for resting on slim to no evidence, and maintains that the Shakyas were a population native to the north-east Gangetic plain who were unrelated to Iranic Sakas.

=== Indo-Scythians ===
The region in modern Afghanistan and Iran where the Saka moved to became known as &quot;land of the Saka&quot; or Sakastan. This is attested in a contemporary Kharosthi inscription found on the Mathura lion capital belonging to the Saka kingdom of the Indo-Scythians (200 BC – 400 AD) in northern India, roughly the same time the Chinese record that the Saka had invaded and settled the country of &quot;Jibin&quot; 罽賓 (i.e. Kashmir, of modern-day India and Pakistan). In the Persian language of contemporary Iran the territory of Drangiana was called Sakastāna, in Armenian as Sakastan, with similar equivalents in Pahlavi, Greek, Sogdian, Syriac, Arabic, and the Middle Persian tongue used in Turfan, Xinjiang, China. The Sakas also captured Gandhara and Taxila, and migrated to North India. The most famous Indo-Scythian king was Maues. An Indo-Scythian kingdom was established in Mathura (200 BC – 400 AD). Weer Rajendra Rishi, an Indian linguist, identified linguistic affinities between Indian and Central Asian languages, which further lends credence to the possibility of historical Sakan influence in North India. According to historian Michael Mitchiner, the Abhira tribe were a Saka people cited in the Gunda inscription of the Western Satrap Rudrasimha I dated to AD 181.

== Historiography ==
Persians referred to all northern nomads as Sakas. Herodotus (IV.64) describes them as Scythians, although they figure under a different name:

=== Strabo ===
In the 1st century BC, the Greek-Roman geographer Strabo gave an extensive description of the peoples of the eastern steppe, whom he located in Central Asia beyond Bactria and Sogdiana.

Strabo went on to list the names of the various tribes he believed to be &quot;Scythian&quot;, and in so doing almost certainly conflated them with unrelated tribes of eastern Central Asia. These tribes included the Saka.

::(Strabo, &quot;Geography&quot;, 11.8.1; transl. 1903 by H. C. Hamilton &amp; W. Falconer.)

=== Indian sources ===
The Sakas receive numerous mentions in Indian texts, including the Purāṇas, the &quot;Manusmṛiti&quot;, the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, and the &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; of Patanjali.

== Language ==
Modern scholarly consensus is that the Eastern Iranian language, ancestral to the Pamir languages in Central Asia and the medieval Saka language of Xinjiang, was one of the Scythian languages. Evidence of the Middle Iranian &quot;Scytho-Khotanese&quot; language survives in Northwest China, where Khotanese-Saka-language documents, ranging from medical texts to Buddhist texts, have been found primarily in Khotan and Tumshuq (northeast of Kashgar). They largely predate the Islamization of Xinjiang under the Turkic-speaking Kara-Khanid Khanate. Similar documents, the Dunhuang manuscripts, were discovered written in the Khotanese Saka language and date mostly from the tenth century.

Attestations of the Saka language show that it was an Eastern Iranian language. The linguistic heartland of Saka was the Kingdom of Khotan, which had two varieties, corresponding to the major settlements at Khotan (now called Hotan) and Tumshuq (now titled Tumxuk). Tumshuqese and Khotanese varieties of Saka contain many borrowings from the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, but also share features with the modern Eastern Iranian languages Wakhi and Pashto.

The Issyk inscription, a short fragment on a silver cup found in the Issyk kurgan in Kazakhstan is believed to be the earliest example of Saka, constituting one of very few autochthonous epigraphic traces of that language. The inscription is in a variant of Kharosthi. Harmatta suggests that the inscriptions are a variant of the Kharosthi language, while Christopher Baumer has said that they closely resemble the Old Turkic runic alphabet. From Khotanese Saka, Harmatta translates the inscription as: &quot;The vessel should hold wine of grapes, added cooked food, so much, to the mortal, then added cooked fresh butter on&quot;.

Linguistic evidence suggest the Wakhi language is descended from Saka languages. According to the Indo-Europeanist Martin Kümmel, Wakhi may be classified as a Western Saka dialect; the other attested Saka dialects, Khotanese and Tumshuqese, would then be classified as Eastern Saka.

== Genetics ==

The earliest studies could only analyze segments of mtDNA, thus providing only broad correlations of affinity to modern West Eurasian or East Eurasian populations. For example, in a 2002 study the mitochondrial DNA of Saka period male and female skeletal remains from a double inhumation kurgan at the Beral site in Kazakhstan was analysed. The two individuals were found to be not closely related. The HV1 mitochondrial sequence of the male was similar to the Anderson sequence which is most frequent in European populations. The HV1 sequence of the female suggested a greater likelihood of Asian origins.

More recent studies have been able to type for specific mtDNA lineages. For example, a 2004 study examined the HV1 sequence obtained from a male &quot;Scytho-Siberian&quot; at the Kizil site in the Altai Republic. It belonged to the N1a maternal lineage, a geographically West Eurasian lineage. Another study by the same team, again of mtDNA from two Scytho-Siberian skeletons found in the Altai Republic, showed that they had been typical males &quot;of mixed Euro-Mongoloid origin&quot;. One of the individuals was found to carry the F2a maternal lineage, and the other the D lineage, both of which are characteristic of East Eurasian populations.
These early studies have been elaborated by an increasing number of studies by Russian and western scholars. Conclusions are (i) an early, Bronze Age mixing of both west and east Eurasian lineages, with western lineages being found far to the east, but not vice versa; (ii) an apparent reversal by Iron Age times, with an increasing presence of East Eurasian mtDNA lineages in the Western steppe; (iii) the possible role of migrations from the south, the Balkano-Danubian and Iranian regions, toward the steppe.

Unterländer, et al. (2017) found genetic evidence that the modern-day descendants of Eastern Scythians are found &quot;almost exclusively&quot; among modern-day Siberian Turkic speakers, suggesting that future studies could determine the extent to which the Eastern Scythians were involved in the early formation of Turkic-speaking populations.

===Haplogroups===
Ancient Y-DNA data was finally provided by Keyser &quot;et al.&quot; in 2009. They studied the haplotypes and haplogroups of 26 ancient human specimens from the Krasnoyarsk area in Siberia dated from between the middle of the 2nd millennium BC and the 4th century AD (Scythian and Sarmatian timeframe). Nearly all subjects belonged to haplogroup R-M17. The authors suggest that their data shows that between the Bronze and the Iron Ages the constellation of populations known variously as Scythians, Andronovians, etc. were blue- (or green-) eyed, fair-skinned and light-haired people who might have played a role in the early development of the Tarim Basin civilisation. Moreover, this study found that they were genetically more closely related to modern populations in eastern Europe than those of central and southern Asia. The ubiquity and dominance of the R1a Y-DNA lineage contrasted markedly with the diversity seen in the mtDNA profiles.

In May 2018, a genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; examined the remains of twenty-eight Inner Asian Sakas buried between ca. 900 BC to AD 1, compromising eight Sakas of southern Siberia (Tagar culture), eight Sakas of the central steppe (Tasmola culture), and twelve Sakas of the Tian Shan. The six samples of Y-DNA extracted from the Tian Shan Saka belonged to the West Eurasian haplogroups R (four samples), R1 and R1a1. Four samples of Y-DNA extracted from central Steppe sakas belonged to haplogroup R1 and R1a, while one individual belonged to haplogroup E1b1b.

The samples of mtDNA extracted from the Tian Shan Saka belonged to C4, H4d, T2a1, U5a1d2b, H2a, U5a1a1, HV6 (two samples), D4j8 (two samples), W1c and G2a1.

According to Tikhonov, et al. (2019), the Eastern Scythians and the Xiongnu &quot;possibly bore proto-Turkic elements&quot;, based on a continuation of maternal and paternal haplogroups.

===Autosomal DNA===
The 2018 in study detected significant genetic differences between analyzed Inner Asian Saka-associated samples and Scythian samples of the Pannonian Basin, as well as between different Saka subgroups of southern Siberia, the central steppe and the Tian Shan. While Scythians (or &quot;Hungarian Saka&quot;) harbored exclusively ancestry associated with Western Steppe Herders, Inner Asian Saka displayed additional Neolithic Iranian (BMAC) and Southern Siberian hunter-gatherer (represented through a proxy of modern Altaians) components in varying degrees. Tian Shan Sakas were found to be of about 70% Western Steppe Herder (WSH) ancestry, 25% Southern Siberian Hunter-Gatherer ancestry and 5% Iranian Neolithic ancestry. The Iranian Neolithic ancestry was probably from the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex. Sakas of the Tasmola culture were found to be of about 56% WSH ancestry and 44% Southern Siberian Hunter-Gather ancestry. The peoples of the Tagar culture had about 83.5% WSH ancestry, 9% Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) ancestry and 7.5% Southern Siberian Hunter-Gatherer ancestry. The study suggested that the Inner Asian Saka were the source of West Eurasian ancestry among the Xiongnu, and that the Huns probably emerged through minor male-driven geneflow into the Saka through westward migrations by the Xiongnu. A genetic study published in 2020 in &quot;Cell&quot;, modeled the ancestry of several Saka groups as a combination of Sintashta (Western Steppe Herders) and Baikal EBA ancestry (Western Baikal early Bronze Age hunter-gatherers, a profile consisting of about 80% Ancient Northeast Asian and 20% Ancient North Eurasian ancestries), with varying degrees of an additional Neolithic Iranian (BMAC) component. Specifically, Central Sakas of the Tasmola culture were found to be of about 43% Sintashta ancestry, 50% Baikal_EBA ancestry and 7% BMAC ancestry. Tagar Sakas (Tagar culture) were found to have an elevated Sintashta proportion (69% Sintashta, 24% Baikal_EBA, and 7% BMAC), while Tian Shan Sakas had an elevated BMAC proportion at 24% (50% Sintashta, 26% Baikal_EBA, and 24% BMAC). The eastern Uyuk Sakas (Arzhan culture) had 50% Sintashta, 44% Baikal_EBA, and 6% BMAC ancestry. The Pazyryk Sakas had elevated Baikal_EBA ancestry, with a nearly non-existent BMAC component (32% Sintashta, 68% Baikal_EBA, and ~0% BMAC). Two other genetic studies published in 2021 and 2022 found that the Saka originated from a shared WSH-like (Srubnaya, Sintashta, and Andronovo culture) background with additional BMAC and East Eurasian-like ancestry. The Eastern ancestry among the Saka can also be represented by Lake Baikal (Shamanka_EBA-like) groups. The spread of Saka-like ancestry can be linked with the dispersal of Eastern Iranian languages (such as Khotanese).

A later different Eastern influx is evident in three outlier samples of the Tasmola culture (Tasmola Birlik) and one of the Pazyryk culture (Pazyryk Berel), which displayed c. 70-83% additional Ancient Northeast Asian ancestry represented by the Neolithic Devil’s Gate Cave specimen, suggesting them to be recent migrants from further East. The same additional Eastern ancestry is found among the later groups of Huns (Hun Berel 300CE, Hun elite 350CE), and the Karakaba remains (830CE). At the same time, western Sarmatian-like and minor additional BMAC-like ancestry spread eastwards, with a Saka-associated sample from southeastern Kazakhstan (Konyr Tobe 300CE) displaying around 85% Sarmatian and 15% BMAC ancestry. Sarmatians are modeled to derive primarily from the preceding Western Steppe Herders of the Pontic–Caspian steppe.The most closely related modern population to the Saka (and other Scythian groups) are the Tajiks, an Iranian peoples indigenous to Southern Central Asia, which display genetic continuity to Bronze and Iron Age Central Asians. These genetic links are paralleled by previous proposed &quot;linguistic and physical anthropological links between the Tajiks and Scythians&quot;. There is also increasing evidence for genetic affinities between the Eastern Scythians (such as the Pazyryk culture) and Turkic-speaking groups, which formed via admixture events during the Iron Age between local Saka groups and geneflow from the Eastern Steppe, but also Uralic and Paleo-Siberian peoples. The admixture with West Eurasian sources was found to be &quot;in accordance with the linguistically documented language borrowing in Turkic languages&quot;.

===East-West migrations and cultural transmission===
Genetic data across Eurasia suggest that the Scythian cultural phenomenon was accompanied by some degree of migration from east to west, starting in the area of the Altai region. In particular, the Classical Scythians of the western Eurasian steppe were not direct descendants of the local Bronze Age populations, but partly resulted from this east-west spread. This also suggests that Scythoïd cultural characteristics were not simply the result of the transfer of material culture, but were also accompanied by human migrations of Saka populations from the east.

The region between the Caspian Sea and of the Southern Urals originally had populations of Srubnaya (1900 BC–1200 BCE) and Andronovo (c. 2000–1150 BCE) ancestry ancestry, but, starting with the Iron Age (c.1000 BCE) became a region of intense ethnic and cultural interaction between European and Asian components. From the 7th century BCE, Early Saka nomads started to settle in the Southern Urals, coming from Central Asia, the Altai-Sayan region, and Central and Northern Kazakhstan. The Itkul culture (7th-5th century BCE) is one of these Early Saka cultures, based in the eastern foothills of the Urals, which was assimilated into the Sauromatian and Early Sarmatian cultures. Circa 600 BCE, groups from the Saka Tasmola culture settled in the southern Urals. Circa 500 BCE, other groups from the area of Ancient Khorezm settled in the western part of the southern Urals, who also assimilated into the Early Sarmatians. As a result, a large-scale integrated union of nomads from Central Asia formed in the area in the 5th–4th century BCE, with fairly uniformized cultural practices. This cultural complex, with notable ‘‘foreign elements’’, corresponds to the ‘‘royal’’ burials of Filippovka kurgan, and define the &quot;Prokhorovka period&quot; of the Early Sarmatians.

== Archaeology ==
The spectacular grave-goods from Arzhan, and others in Tuva, have been dated from about 800 BC onward, and the kurgans of Shilikty in eastern Kazakhstan circa 700 BC, and are associated with the Early Sakas. Burials at Pazyryk in the Altay Mountains have included some spectacularly preserved Sakas of the &quot;Pazyryk culture&quot; – including the Ice Maiden of the 5th century BC.

===Arzhan 1 kurgan ()===

Arzhan-1 was excavated by M. P. Gryaznov in the 1970s, establishing the origins of Scythian culture in the region in the 10th to 8th centuries BC: Arzhan-1 was carbon-dated to circa 800 BC. Many of the styles of the artifacts found in Arzhan 1 (such as the animal style images of deer, boar, and panther) soon propagated to the west, probably following a migration mouvement from the east to the west in the 9th-7th centuries BC, and ultimately reaching European Scythia and influencing artistic styles there.

===Shilikty/ Baigetobe kurgan ()===
Shilikty is an archaeological site in eastern Kazakhstan with numerous 8-6th century BC Early Saka kurgans. Carbon-14 dating suggests date of 730-690 BC for the kurgans, and a broad contemporaneity with the Arzhan-2 kurgan in Tuva.

The Kurgans contained vast quantities of precious golden jewelry. Remains of a &quot;golden man&quot; (similar to the Issyk kurgan golden man) were found in 2003, with 4262 gold finds.

===Arzhan 2 ()===
Arzhan-2 was an undisturbed burial. Archaeologists found a royal couple, sixteen murdered attendants, and 9,300 objects. 5,700 of these artifacts were made of gold, weighing a Siberian record-breaking twenty kilograms. The male, who researchers guess was some sort of king, wore a golden torc, a jacket decorated with 2,500 golden panther figurines, a gold-encrusted dagger on a belt, trousers sewn with golden beads, and gold-cuffed boots. The woman wore a red cloak that was also covered in 2,500 golden panther figurines, as well as a golden-hilted iron dagger, a gold comb, and a wooden ladle with a golden handle.

=== Eleke Sazy Burial Complex ()===

In 2020, archaeologists excavated multiple burial mounds in the Eleke Sazy Valley in East Kazakhstan. Here, a large number of gold artifacts were found. These artifacts included golf harness fittings, pendants, chains, appliqués, and more – most of which are in the Animal Style of the Scythian-Saka era dating back to the 5th–4th centuries BC.

===Berel burial mound ()===
Near the selo of Berel in the Katonkaragay District of eastern Kazakhstan () excavations of ancient burial mounds have revealed artefacts the sophistication of which are encouraging a revaluation of the nomadic cultures of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC.

=== Pazyryk culture ()===
Saka burials documented by modern archaeologists include the kurgans at Pazyryk in the Ulagan (Red) district of the Altai Republic, south of Novosibirsk in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia (near Mongolia). Archaeologists have extrapolated the Pazyryk culture from these finds: five large burial mounds and several smaller ones between 1925 and 1949, one opened in 1947 by Russian archaeologist Sergei Rudenko. The burial mounds concealed chambers of larch-logs covered over with large cairns of boulders and stones.

The Pazyryk culture flourished between the 7th and 3rd century BC in the area associated with the &quot;Sacae&quot;.

Ordinary Pazyryk graves contain only common utensils, but in one, among other treasures, archaeologists found the famous Pazyryk Carpet, the oldest surviving wool-pile oriental rug. Another striking find, a 3-metre-high four-wheel funerary chariot, survived well-preserved from the 5th to 4th century BC.

===Southern Siberian kurgans excavated in the 18th century===
During the 18th century and the Russian expansion into Siberia, many Saka kurgans were plundered, sometimes by independent grave-robbers or sometimes officially at the instigation of Peter the Great, but usually without any archaeological records being taken. Only the general location where they were excavated is known, between modern Kazakhstan and the Altai Mountains.
ru
Many of these artefacts were part of the archaeological presents sent by , Governor of Siberia based in Tobolsk, to Peter the Great in Saint-Petersburg in 1716. They are now located in the Hermitage Museum in Saint-Petersburg, and form the Siberian Collection of Peter the Great. Their estimated datation ranges from the 7th century BC to the 1st century BC, depending on the artefacts.

=== Tillia Tepe treasure (2nd-1st century BC) ===
A site found in 1968 in Tillia Tepe (literally &quot;the golden hill&quot;) in northern Afghanistan (former Bactria) near Shebergan consisted of the graves of five women and one man with extremely rich jewelry, dated to around the 1st century BC, and probably related to that of Saka tribes normally living slightly to the north. Altogether the graves yielded several thousands of pieces of fine jewelry, usually made from combinations of gold, turquoise and lapis-lazuli.

A high degree of cultural syncretism pervades the findings, however. Hellenistic cultural and artistic influences appear in many of the forms and human depictions (from amorini to rings with the depiction of Athena and her name inscribed in Greek), attributable to the existence of the Seleucid empire and Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the same area until around 140 BC, and the continued existence of the Indo-Greek kingdom in the northwestern Indian sub-continent until the beginning of our era. This testifies to the richness of cultural influences in the area of Bactria at that time.

== Culture ==
=== Gender roles ===
Recently, evidence confirmed by the full-genomic analysis of a Scythian child&#x27;s remains found in a coffin made of a larch trunk, which was discovered in Saryg-Bulun in Central Tuva, revealed that the individual, previously thought to be male because it had items that were associated with the belief that Scythian society was male-dominated, was actually female. Along with the leather skirt, the burial also contained a leather headdress painted with red pigment, a coat sewn from jerboa fur, a leather belt with bronze ornaments and buckles, a leather quiver with arrows with painted ornaments on the shafts, a fully-preserved battle pick, and a bow. These items provide valuable insights into the material culture and lifestyle of the Scythians, including their hunting and warfare practices, and their use of animal hides for clothing.

=== Art ===
The art of the Saka was of a similar styles as other Iranian peoples of the steppes, which is referred to collectively as Scythian art. In 2001, the discovery of an undisturbed royal Scythian burial-barrow at Arzhan illustrated Scythian animal-style gold that lacks the direct influence of Greek styles. Forty-four pounds of gold weighed down the royal couple in this burial, discovered near Kyzyl, capital of the Siberian republic of Tuva.

Ancient influences from Central Asia became identifiable in China following contacts of metropolitan China with nomadic western and northwestern border territories from the 8th century BC. The Chinese adopted the Scythian-style animal art of the steppes (descriptions of animals locked in combat), particularly the rectangular belt-plaques made of gold or bronze, and created their own versions in jade and steatite.

Following their expulsion by the Yuezhi, some Saka may also have migrated to the area of Yunnan in southern China. Saka warriors could also have served as mercenaries for the various kingdoms of ancient China. Excavations of the prehistoric art of the Dian civilisation of Yunnan have revealed hunting scenes of Caucasoid horsemen in Central Asian clothing.

Saka influences have been identified as far as Korea and Japan. Various Korean artifacts, such as the royal crowns of the kingdom of Silla, are said to be of &quot;Scythian&quot; design. Similar crowns, brought through contacts with the continent, can also be found in Kofun era Japan.

=== Clothing ===

Similar to other eastern Iranian peoples represented on the reliefs of the Apadana at Persepolis, Sakas are depicted as wearing long trousers, which cover the uppers of their boots. Over their shoulders they trail a type of long mantle, with one diagonal edge in back. One particular tribe of Sakas (&quot;the Saka tigraxaudā&quot;) wore pointed caps. Herodotus in his description of the Persian army mentions the Sakas as wearing trousers and tall pointed caps.
Men and women wore long trousers, often adorned with metal plaques and often embroidered or adorned with felt s; trousers could have been wider or tight fitting depending on the area. Materials used depended on the wealth, climate and necessity.

Herodotus says Sakas had &quot;high caps tapering to a point and stiffly upright.&quot; Asian Saka headgear is clearly visible on the Persepolis Apadana staircase bas-relief – high pointed hat with flaps over ears and the nape of the neck. From China to the Danube delta, men seemed to have worn a variety of soft headgear – either conical like the one described by Herodotus, or rounder, more like a Phrygian cap.

Saka women dressed in much the same fashion as men. A Pazyryk burial, discovered in the 1990s, contained the skeletons of a man and a woman, each with weapons, arrowheads, and an axe. Herodotus mentioned that Sakas had &quot;high caps and ... wore trousers.&quot; Clothing was sewn from plain-weave wool, hemp cloth, silk fabrics, felt, leather and hides.
Pazyryk findings give the most almost fully preserved garments and clothing worn by the Scythian/Saka peoples. Ancient Persian bas-reliefs, inscriptions from Apadana and Behistun and archaeological findings give visual representations of these garments.

Based on the Pazyryk findings (can be seen also in the south Siberian, Uralic and Kazakhstan rock drawings) some caps were topped with zoomorphic wooden sculptures firmly attached to a cap and forming an integral part of the headgear, similar to the surviving nomad helmets from northern China. Men and warrior women wore tunics, often embroidered, adorned with felt applique work, or metal (golden) plaques.

Persepolis Apadana again serves a good starting point to observe the tunics of the Sakas. They appear to be a sewn, long-sleeved garment that extended to the knees and was girded with a belt, while the owner&#x27;s weapons were fastened to the belt (sword or dagger, gorytos, battle-axe, whetstone etc.). Based on numerous archeological findings, men and warrior women wore long-sleeved tunics that were always belted, often with richly ornamented belts. The Kazakhstan Saka (e.g. Issyk Golden Man/Maiden) wore shorter and closer-fitting tunics than the Pontic steppe Scythians. Some Pazyryk culture Saka wore short belted tunic with a lapel on the right side, with upright collar, &#x27;puffed&#x27; sleeves narrowing at the wrist and bound in narrow cuffs of a color different from the rest of the tunic.

Men and women wore coats: e.g. Pazyryk Saka had many varieties, from fur to felt. They could have worn a riding coat that later was known as a Median robe or Kantus. Long sleeved, and open, it seems that on the Persepolis Apadana Skudrian delegation is perhaps shown wearing such coat. The Pazyryk felt tapestry shows a rider wearing a billowing cloak.

====Tattoos====
Men and women of eastern saka are known to have been extensively tattooed. The men in the Pazyryk burials had extensive tattoos in the Siberian animal style. A Pazyryk chief in burial mound 2, had his body covered in animal style tattoos, but not his face. Parts of the body had deteriorated, but much of the tattooing was still clearly visible (see image). Subsequent investigation using reflected infrared photography revealed that all five bodies discovered in the Pazyryk kurgans were tattooed. No instruments specifically designed for tattooing were found, but the Pazyryks had extremely fine needles with which they did miniature embroidery, and these were probably used for tattooing. The chief was elaborately decorated with an interlocking series of striking designs representing a variety of fantastic beasts. The best preserved tattoos were images of a donkey, a mountain ram, two highly stylized deer with long antlers and an imaginary carnivore on the right arm. Two monsters resembling griffins decorate the chest, and on the left arm are three partially obliterated images which seem to represent two deer and a mountain goat. On the front of the right leg a fish extends from the foot to the knee. A monster crawls over the right foot, and on the inside of the shin is a series of four running rams which touch each other to form a single design. The left leg also bears tattoos, but these designs could not be clearly distinguished. In addition, the chief&#x27;s back was tattooed with a series of small circles in line with the vertebral column. The Siberian Ice Maiden is also known for her extensive tattoos.

=== Warfare ===
A skull from an Iron Age cemetery in South Siberia shows evidence of scalping. It lends physical evidence to the practice of scalp taking by the Scythians living there.

===Later depictions of &quot;Sakas&quot; in China (1st-3rd century AD)===
Numerous depictions of foreigners of Saka appearance appear in China around the Eastern Han period (25–220 AD), sometimes as far as east as Shandong. They may have appeared in relation with the conflicts against the Scythoïd Xirong in the west or the Donghu people in the North, or the Kushans in the area of Xinjiang. They were generally called &quot;Hu&quot; by the Chinese.

<doc id="176865" wikidata="Q1025017" url="?curid=176865" title="Cache coherence">
<text>In computer architecture, cache coherence is the uniformity of shared resource data that is stored in multiple local caches. In a cache coherent system, if multiple clients have a cached copy of the same region of a shared memory resource, all copies are the same. Without cache coherence, a change made to the region by one client may not be seen by others, and errors can result when the data used by different clients is mismatched.

A cache coherence protocol is used to maintain cache coherency. The two main types are snooping and directory-based protocols.

Cache coherence is of particular relevance in multiprocessing systems, where each CPU may have its own local cache of a shared memory resource.

==Overview==
In a shared memory multiprocessor system with a separate cache memory for each processor, it is possible to have many copies of shared data: one copy in the main memory and one in the local cache of each processor that requested it. When one of the copies of data is changed, the other copies must reflect that change. Cache coherence is the discipline which ensures that the changes in the values of shared operands (data) are propagated throughout the system in a timely fashion.

The following are the requirements for cache coherence:
;Write Propagation: Changes to the data in any cache must be propagated to other copies (of that cache line) in the peer caches.
;Transaction Serialization: Reads/Writes to a single memory location must be seen by all processors in the same order.
Theoretically, coherence can be performed at the load/store granularity. However, in practice it is generally performed at the granularity of cache blocks.

==Definition==
Coherence defines the behavior of reads and writes to a single address location.

In a multiprocessor system, consider that more than one processor has cached a copy of the memory location X. The following conditions are necessary to achieve cache coherence:
# In a read made by a processor P to a location X that follows a write by the same processor P to X, with no writes to X by another processor occurring between the write and the read instructions made by P, X must always return the value written by P.
# In a read made by a processor P1 to location X that follows a write by another processor P2 to X, with no other writes to X made by any processor occurring between the two accesses and with the read and write being sufficiently separated, X must always return the value written by P2. This condition defines the concept of coherent view of memory. Propagating the writes to the shared memory location ensures that all the caches have a coherent view of the memory. If processor P1 reads the old value of X, even after the write by P2, we can say that the memory is incoherent.
The above conditions satisfy the Write Propagation criteria required for cache coherence. However, they are not sufficient as they do not satisfy the Transaction Serialization condition. To illustrate this better, consider the following example:

A multi-processor system consists of four processors - P1, P2, P3 and P4, all containing cached copies of a shared variable &quot;S&quot; whose initial value is 0. Processor P1 changes the value of &quot;S&quot; (in its cached copy) to 10 following which processor P2 changes the value of &quot;S&quot; in its own cached copy to 20. If we ensure only write propagation, then P3 and P4 will certainly see the changes made to &quot;S&quot; by P1 and P2. However, P3 may see the change made by P1 after seeing the change made by P2 and hence return 10 on a read to &quot;S&quot;. P4 on the other hand may see changes made by P1 and P2 in the order in which they are made and hence return 20 on a read to &quot;S&quot;. The processors P3 and P4 now have an incoherent view of the memory.

Therefore, in order to satisfy Transaction Serialization, and hence achieve Cache Coherence, the following condition along with the previous two mentioned in this section must be met:
* Writes to the same location must be sequenced. In other words, if location X received two different values A and B, in this order, from any two processors, the processors can never read location X as B and then read it as A. The location X must be seen with values A and B in that order.
The alternative definition of a coherent system is via the definition of sequential consistency memory model: &quot;the cache coherent system must appear to execute all threads’ loads and stores to a &quot;single&quot; memory location in a total order that respects the program order of each thread&quot;. Thus, the only difference between the cache coherent system and sequentially consistent system is in the number of address locations the definition talks about (single memory location for a cache coherent system, and all memory locations for a sequentially consistent system).

Another definition is: &quot;a multiprocessor is cache consistent if all writes to the same memory location are performed in some sequential order&quot;.

Rarely, but especially in algorithms, coherence can instead refer to the locality of reference.
Multiple copies of the same data can exist in different cache simultaneously and if processors are allowed to update their own copies freely, an inconsistent view of memory can result.

== Coherence mechanisms ==

The two most common mechanisms of ensuring coherency are &quot;snooping&quot; and &quot;directory-based&quot;, each having their own benefits and drawbacks. Snooping based protocols tend to be faster, if enough bandwidth is available, since all transactions are a request/response seen by all processors. The drawback is that snooping isn&#x27;t scalable. Every request must be broadcast to all nodes in a system, meaning that as the system gets larger, the size of the (logical or physical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow. Directories, on the other hand, tend to have longer latencies (with a 3 hop request/forward/respond) but use much less bandwidth since messages are point to point and not broadcast. For this reason, many of the larger systems (&gt;64 processors) use this type of cache coherence.

=== Snooping ===

: First introduced in 1983, snooping is a process where the individual caches monitor address lines for accesses to memory locations that they have cached. The &quot;write-invalidate protocols&quot; and &quot;write-update protocols&quot; make use of this mechanism.

: For the snooping mechanism, a snoop filter reduces the snooping traffic by maintaining a plurality of entries, each representing a cache line that may be owned by one or more nodes. When replacement of one of the entries is required, the snoop filter selects for the replacement of the entry representing the cache line or lines owned by the fewest nodes, as determined from a presence vector in each of the entries. A temporal or other type of algorithm is used to refine the selection if more than one cache line is owned by the fewest nodes.

=== Directory-based ===

: In a directory-based system, the data being shared is placed in a common directory that maintains the coherence between caches. The directory acts as a filter through which the processor must ask permission to load an entry from the primary memory to its cache. When an entry is changed, the directory either updates or invalidates the other caches with that entry.
Distributed shared memory systems mimic these mechanisms in an attempt to maintain consistency between blocks of memory in loosely coupled systems.

==Coherence protocols==
Coherence protocols apply cache coherence in multiprocessor systems. The intention is that two clients must never see different values for the same shared data.

The protocol must implement the basic requirements for coherence. It can be tailor-made for the target system or application.

Protocols can also be classified as snoopy or directory-based. Typically, early systems used directory-based protocols where a directory would keep a track of the data being shared and the sharers. In snoopy protocols, the transaction requests (to read, write, or upgrade) are sent out to all processors. All processors snoop the request and respond appropriately.

Write propagation in snoopy protocols can be implemented by either of the following methods:
;Write-invalidate: When a write operation is observed to a location that a cache has a copy of, the cache controller invalidates its own copy of the snooped memory location, which forces a read from main memory of the new value on its next access.
;Write-update: When a write operation is observed to a location that a cache has a copy of, the cache controller updates its own copy of the snooped memory location with the new data.
If the protocol design states that whenever any copy of the shared data is changed, all the other copies must be &quot;updated&quot; to reflect the change, then it is a write-update protocol. If the design states that a write to a cached copy by any processor requires other processors to discard or invalidate their cached copies, then it is a write-invalidate protocol.

However, scalability is one shortcoming of broadcast protocols.

Various models and protocols have been devised for maintaining coherence, such as MSI, MESI (aka Illinois), MOSI, MOESI, MERSI, MESIF, write-once, Synapse, Berkeley, Firefly and Dragon protocol. In 2011, ARM Ltd proposed the AMBA 4 ACE for handling coherency in SoCs. The AMBA CHI (Coherent Hub Interface) specification from ARM Ltd, which belongs to AMBA5 group of specifications defines the interfaces for the connection of fully coherent processors.

<text>The Convair F-106 Delta Dart is an all-weather interceptor aircraft designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Convair.

The F-106 was designed in response to the 1954 interceptor program. Envisioned as an imagined &quot;Ultimate Interceptor&quot;, it was a development of the F-102 Delta Dagger, and commenced as the &quot;F-102B&quot; prior to being redesignated by the United States Air Force (USAF). The F-106 was designed without a gun or provision for carrying bombs, instead carrying its AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles within an internal weapons bay, its clean exterior was beneficial to supersonic flight. Major differences from the F-102 included the adoption of the more powerful Pratt &amp; Whitney J75 turbojet engine, heavily redesigned air inlets along with a variable-geometry inlet duct to suit a wide range of supersonic speeds, application of the area rule to the fuselage shaping, and a general increase in size. On 26 December 1956, the first prototype performed its maiden flight. After flight testing demonstrated lesser performance gains than anticipated, the USAF ultimately only ordered 350 of the planned 1,000 F-106s.

Becoming operational in June 1959, the F-106 was the primary all-weather interceptor aircraft of the USAF through much of the Cold War era; it ended up being the final specialist interceptor to be used by the service to date. It was never used in combat nor were any export opportunities secured. During the 1960s, a competitive evaluation between the F-106 and the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II determined the latter to be marginally superior, yet the type continued to be operated for a further two decades due to extensive demand for the F-4 in other roles. Convair proposed various improved models of the F-106, typically focused on the radar, communications, and other avionics, but none of these schemes were pursued. In one high-profile incident over Montana on 2 February 1970, an unmanned F-106 recovered from a flat spin after its pilot had ejected, belly landing relatively intact in a snow-covered field; it was recovered and continued to be flown for numerous years afterwards.

The F-106 was gradually withdrawn from USAF service during the 1980s as the arrival of newer air superiority fighters, particularly the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, had made the role of dedicated interceptors obsolete. Numerous F-106s would be operated for a time by the Air National Guard. Many withdrawn aircraft were promptly converted into target drones and redesignated &quot;QF-106&quot; under the &quot;Pacer Six&quot; program, which were used up in 1998. A handful of F-106s were operated by NASA for experimental purposes, such as the Eclipse Project, through to 1998.

==Development==
===Background===
The F-106 was the ultimate development of the USAF&#x27;s 1954 interceptor program of the early 1950s. The initial winner of this competition had been the F-102 Delta Dagger, but early versions of this aircraft had demonstrated extremely poor performance, being limited to flying at subsonic speeds and relatively low altitudes. During the testing program the F-102 underwent numerous changes to improve its performance, notably the application of the area rule to the fuselage shaping and a change of engine, and the dropping of the advanced MX-1179 fire control system and its replacement with a slightly upgraded version of the MX-1 already in use on subsonic designs. The resulting aircraft became the F-102A, and in spite of being considered barely suitable for its mission, the Air Force sent out a production contract in March 1954, under which the first deliveries were expected during the following year.

By December 1951, the Air Force had already turned its attention to a further improved version, which was initially referred to as the F-102B. The main planned change was the replacement of the F-102A&#x27;s Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 (which had itself replaced the original J40) with the more powerful Wright J67 (a Bristol Olympus produced under license). By the time this engine would be available, the MX-1179 was expected to be available, and thus it was selected as well. The intended result would be the &quot;ultimate interceptor&quot; that the USAF had originally sought. However, while initial work on the Olympus design appeared to go well, by August 1953 Wright was already a full year behind schedule in development. Continued development did not resolve problems with the engine, and in early 1955 the Air Force approved the switch to the Pratt &amp; Whitney J75.

The J75 was somewhat larger than the J57 in the F-102A, and had greater This demanded changes to the inlets to allow more airflow, and led to the further refinement of using a somewhat shorter variable-geometry inlet duct to allow the intakes to be tuned to best performance across a wide range of supersonic speeds. The fuselage grew slightly longer, and was cleaned up and simplified in many ways. The wing was slightly enlarged in area, and a redesigned vertical tail surface was used. The engine&#x27;s two-position afterburner exhaust nozzle was also used for idle thrust control, held open to decrease thrust by 40%, resulting in slower taxiing and less brake wear.

===Competing efforts and production arrangements===
Throughout its early development, the F-102B had to compete for attention and resources with the F-102A; the aviation author Marcelle Knaack observed that there were fewer funds to develop the more capable systems of the F-102B, which would have been useful in more quickly overcoming some of the technical difficulties that arose. The number of F-102As on order grew substantially beyond that which had been originally forecast, indicative of the growing importance attached to what had once been intended to be an interim or &#x27;stop-gap&#x27; aircraft to fill in until the F-102B could be delivered. During December 1955, a mock-up with the expected layout of the MX-1179, now known as the MA-1, was inspected and approved.

On 18 April 1956, an extended production contract for 17 F-102Bs was issued to Convair, representing substantially fewer aircraft than had been originally anticipated at this stage. On 17 June of that year, the aircraft was officially re-designated as the F-106A. On 18 August 1956, the USAF issued a systems development directive that called for development and production of the F-106 Knaack attributed this policy as being responsible for several later problems in the program. During April 1957, the USAF formally rejected Convair&#x27;s F-102C proposal (essentially a reengined model of the F-102) to concentrate on the more advanced F-106 program, which it had then anticipated to enter service during the following year.

===Flight testing===
On 26 December 1956, the first prototype F-106, an aerodynamic test bed, performed its maiden flight from Edwards Air Force Base. On 26 February 1957, the second prototype, which was outfitted with a fuller set of equipment, made its first flight. Early flight testing around the end of 1956 and beginning of 1957 demonstrated somewhat disappointing results, having achieved less of a performance gain over the F-102 than had been anticipated. Specifically, both the acceleration and maximum speed were beneath Convair&#x27;s own estimates. Furthermore, both the engine and avionics proved to be somewhat unreliable. These combined problems, and the delays associated with them, were nearly responsible for the termination of the program.

However, the service decided to persist with the F-106 program after the Air Defense Command had heavily advocated for it. Based upon the test data submitted, USAF officials had determined that modifications to the inlet duct cowling and charging ejectors were likely to increase both acceleration and speed; modifications would be made following the completion of Category II testing and were evaluated during Category III testing. At this stage, the service enacted several measures to hasten development towards production; in April 1957, it authorized the conditional acceptance of several F-106s being used by Convair for flight testing; it also took several quick decisions to settle outstanding development questions. By mid-1957, funding for 120 F-106As had been allocated. The USAF ultimately opted to order 350 F-106s, substantially fewer than the planned fleet of 1,000 aircraft. Deliveries of the single-seat F-106A and the twin-seat F-106B combat-capable trainer variant commenced to 15 fighter interceptor squadrons in October 1959.

===World Speed record===
On 15 December 1959, Major Joseph W. Rogers set a world speed record of 1,525.96 mph (2,455.79 km/h) in a Delta Dart at 40,500 ft (12,300 m). That year, Charles E. Myers flew the same model aircraft at 1,544 mph (2,484 km/h).

==Design==
The F-106 was envisaged as a specialized all-weather missile-armed interceptor to shoot down bombers. It was complemented by other Century Series fighters for other roles such as daylight air superiority or fighter-bombing. To support its role, the F-106 was equipped with the Hughes MA-1 integrated fire-control system, which could be linked to the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) network for ground control interception (GCI) missions, allowing the aircraft to be steered by controllers. The MA-1 proved extremely troublesome and was eventually upgraded more than 60 times in service.

Similarly to the F-102, the F-106 was designed without a gun, or provision for carrying bombs, but it carried its missiles in an internal weapons bay for clean supersonic flight. It was armed with four Hughes AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missiles (either AIM-4G infra-red guided missiles or semi-active radar homing (SARH)-guided (which detected reflected radar signals) AIM-4E/F missiles), along with a single 1.5 kiloton-warhead AIR-2 (MB-2) Genie unguided air-to-air rocket intended to be fired into enemy bomber formations. Like its predecessor, the F-102 Delta Dagger, it could carry a drop tank under each wing. Later fighters such as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle carried missiles recessed in the fuselage or externally, but stealth aircraft would re-adopt the idea of carrying missiles or bombs internally for reduced radar signature.

The first ejection seat fitted to early F-106s was a variation of the seat used by the F-102 and was called the Weber interim seat. It was a catapult seat which used an explosive charge to propel it clear of the aircraft. This seat was not a zero-zero seat and was inadequate for ejections at supersonic speeds as well as ground level ejections and ejections at speeds below and . The second seat that replaced the Weber interim seat was the Convair/ICESC (Industry Crew Escape System Committee) Supersonic Rotational B-seat, called the supersonic &quot;bobsled&quot;, hence the B designation. It was designed with supersonic ejection as the primary criterion since the F-106 was capable of Mach-2 performance. Fighter pilots viewed high speed ejections as the most important. Seat designers viewed an ejection at low altitude and slow speed as the most likely possibility. The ejection sequence with the B-seat was quite complicated and there were some unsuccessful ejections that resulted in pilot fatalities. The third seat, that replaced the Convair B-seat, was the Weber Zero-Zero &quot;ROCAT&quot; (for Rocket Catapult) seat. Weber Aircraft Corporation designed a &quot;zero-zero&quot; seat to operate at up to . High-altitude supersonic ejections were rare and ejections at relatively low altitudes and low speeds were more likely. The Weber &quot;zero-zero&quot; seat was satisfactory and was retrofitted to the F-106 after 1965.

==Operational history==
Early operations of the F-106 were troubled by numerous technical issues. These included generator defects, fuel-flow issues (particularly during cold weather), and combustor-starter malfunctions. During December 1959, all F-106s were temporarily grounded following the accidental jettisoning of the canopy mid-flight on one aircraft. Many, but not all, of these problems were resolved by the start of 1961; this can be partially attributed to two major modification and retrofit program conducted during this timeframe. Following the resolution of initial teething problems – in particular an ejection seat that killed the first 12 pilots to eject from the aircraft – its exceptional performance led to the aircraft becoming relatively popular amongst its pilots.

The F-106 served in the contiguous US, Alaska, and Iceland, as well as for brief periods in Germany and South Korea. The F-106 was the second highest sequentially numbered P/F- aircraft to enter service under the old number sequence (the F-111 was highest), before the system was reset under the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system. In service, the F-106&#x27;s official name, &quot;Delta Dart,&quot; was rarely used, and the aircraft was universally known simply as &quot;The Six.&quot; The arrival of the F-106 in quantity quickly led to the withdrawal of various older aircraft that were being used in the interceptor role, such as the North American F-86 Sabre and the Northrop F-89 Scorpion.

Although contemplated for use in the Vietnam War, the F-106 never saw combat, nor was it exported to foreign users. After the cancellation of their own Avro Arrow, the Canadian government briefly considered purchasing the F-106C/D.

To standardize aircraft types, the USAF was directed to conduct Operation Highspeed, a flyoff competition between the USAF F-106A and the U.S. Navy F4H-1 (F-4B) Phantom, which was not only as capable as the F-106 as a missile-armed interceptor but could carry as large a bomb load as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber. The Phantom was the winner but would first be used to escort and later replace the F-105 fighter-bomber in the late 1960s before replacing older interceptors in Air Defense Command in the 1970s.

The F-106 was progressively updated in service, with improved avionics, a modified wing featuring a noticeable conical camber, an infrared search and track system, streamlined supersonic wing tanks which provided virtually no degradation to overall aircraft performance, better instrumentation and features like an inflight refuelling receptacle and an arrestor hook for landing emergencies.

Air-to-air combat testing suggested &quot;The Six&quot; was a reasonable match for the F-4 Phantom II in a dogfight, with superior high-altitude turn performance and overall maneuverability (aided by the aircraft&#x27;s lower wing loading). The Phantom had better radar – operated by an additional crewman – and could carry a load of up to four radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow and four infrared AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, while the AIM-4 Falcon missiles carried by the F-106 proved a disappointment for dogfighting over Vietnam. The F-4 had a higher thrust/weight ratio with superior climb, better high speed/low-altitude maneuverability and could be used as a fighter-bomber. Air combat experience over Vietnam showed the need for increased pilot visibility and the utility of a built-in gun, which had been added to the &quot;E&quot; variant of USAF Phantoms.
In 1972, some F-106As were upgraded in Project Six Shooter that involved fitting the F-106 with a new canopy without metal bracing which greatly improved pilot visibility. Also added was an optical gunsight and provision for a M61 Vulcan 20 mm cannon. The M61 Vulcan had 650 rounds of ammunition in the center of the weapons bay, being used in place of the AIR-2 Genie. Many F-106 units opted to fly without the gun, retaining their nuclear payload instead. The F-15A Eagle started replacing the F-106 in 1981, with &quot;The Sixes&quot; typically passed on to Air National Guard units. The F-106 remained in service in various USAF and ANG units until 1988.

===Retirement and conversion into drones===
Between 1 June 1983 and 1 August 1988 the Delta Darts were incrementally retired and sent to the Military Storage and Disposition Center in Arizona. When the need for a high performance Full Scaled Aerial Target Drone was required, the USAF began withdrawing Delta Darts from storage. Starting in 1986, 194 of the surviving surplus aircraft were converted into target drones and these were designated QF-106As and used for target practice vehicles under the &quot;Pacer Six Program&quot; by the Aerial Targets Squadron. The last was destroyed in January 1998. The drones were still capable of being flown as manned aircraft, such as for ferrying to a test; during the test they were flown unmanned. The QF-106 replaced the QF-100 Super Sabre drone; the last shoot down of a QF-106 (57-2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997 after which the QF-106 was superseded by the QF-4S and QF-4E Phantom II drone.

===NASA research and test aircraft===
Six F-106s were retained by NASA for test purposes through 1998. An F-106B two-seat trainer was operated by NASA Langley Research Center between 1979 and 1991. This Delta Dart was used in research programs ranging from testing supersonic engines to improving maneuverability of fighters. Between 1980 and 1986 the aircraft was modified for the purpose of lightning strike research and became known as the &quot;Lightning Strike Plane&quot; and was struck 714 times without damage. On one hour-long flight at in 1984, lightning struck the research aircraft 72 times. One significant modification was the replacement of the composite nose radome by a metallic radome. Although the maximum speed of the F-106 was Mach 2.3, during the lightning experiments it was flown at subsonic speeds into clouds at from . The aircraft was equipped with optical sensors which consisted of a video camera and a light detector. Data acquisition was performed with 1980s state of the art digital waveform recorders.

====Eclipse project====
NASA used six drones in its Eclipse Project which ran from 1997 to 1998. The Dryden Flight Research Center supported project Eclipse which sought to demonstrate the feasibility of a reusable Aerotow-launch vehicle. The objective was to tow, inflight, a modified QF-106 aircraft with a C-141A transport aircraft. The test demonstrated the possibility of towing and launching a space launch vehicle from behind a tow plane.

===The Cornfield Bomber===

On 2 February 1970, an F-106 of the 71st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, piloted by Captain Gary Foust, entered a flat spin over Montana. Foust followed procedures and ejected from the aircraft. The resulting change of balance caused the aircraft to stabilize and later belly land in a snow-covered field, suffering only minor damage. The aircraft, promptly nicknamed &quot;The Cornfield Bomber&quot;, was then sent back to base by rail, repaired and returned to service, and is now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force.

==Variants==

* F-102B: The original designation of the F-106A.
* F-106A: (Convair Model 8-24) Improved version of the F-102. Fitted with the MA-1 Integrated Fire Control System with SAGE datalink, J-75 afterburning turbojet, enlarged intake, variable-geometry inlet ramps and shortened intake ducts, refined fuselage shape, modified wings and redesigned tailfin; tailpipe fitted with a device to reduce the tendency of the jet exhaust to blow unsecured objects around while taxiing, yet allowing virtually maximum performance at high thrust settings including afterburner. Performance was deemed unsatisfactory and modifications were made. The aircraft was capable of low supersonic speeds without afterburner (but with a significant range penalty) and had a maximum altitude at least . Many were fitted with a conically cambered wing for improved takeoff, supersonic and high-altitude flight. To improve the aircraft&#x27;s range the aircraft was fitted with two streamlined external supersonic tanks that still kept the aircraft capable of sustained roll rates of 100 degrees per second. Since these tanks produced virtually no significant performance degradation they were rarely jettisoned and were routinely carried around. After 1972, many F-106s were refitted with a new canopy featuring improved visibility, improved optic sights and provision for a gunpack in the center weapons bay.
* F-106B: (Convair Model 8-27) Two-seat, combat-capable training version. Pilot and instructor are seated in tandem. Due to the extra seat, the fuselage is actually better area ruled; combined with a likely reduction in weight. Weapons configurations same as F-106A.
* NF-106B: This designation was given to two F-106Bs used as test aircraft with NASA and associated research facilities from 1966 to 1991.
* F-106C: Unbuilt version. Aircraft was intended to have the AN/ASG-18 radar and fire control system fitted originally developed for the North American XF-108 Rapier. For its time, it was the largest radar to ever be fitted to a fighter, actually requiring hydraulic actuators to turn the antenna. To accommodate this larger radar system, the nose cone was longer and of greater diameter. The design featured an improved raised canopy design featuring better visibility, canards and lengthened rectangular inlet ducts. The aircraft was to be capable of carrying one GAR-9/AIM-47A in its center bay and one AIM-26A in each side bay. At one time, the US Air Force had considered acquiring 350 of these advanced interceptors, but the F-106C/D project was cancelled on 23 September 1958.
* F-106D: Unbuilt two-seat version of the F-106C.
* F-106X: Unbuilt version (early 1968). It would have been outfitted with canards and powered by a JT4B-22 turbojet. It was envisioned as an alternative to the Lockheed YF-12, and was to have had a fire control system with &quot;look-down/shoot-down&quot; capability fed by a radar dish.
* F-106E: Unbuilt version. On 3 September 1968, Convair issued a proposal for an &quot;improved&quot; interceptor that was to be designated F-106E/F. It was to be compatible with the upcoming airborne warning and control systems as well as with the &quot;over-the-horizon&quot; radar defense network. The F-106E/F would have had a longer nose and a new and improved radar with a look-down/shoot-down tracking and missile launch capability. It would also have had a two-way UHF voice and datalink radio. It would have been capable of launching both nuclear and non-nuclear missiles, including the AIM-26 Nuclear Falcon and the AIM-47.
* F-106F: Unbuilt two-seat version of the F-106E.
* QF-106A: Converted into drones, were still capable of being flown both as manned and unmanned aircraft.
* F-106 RASCAL Project: Unbuilt version. It would have been a low cost satellite launcher.

<text>Crewe () is a railway town and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire East in Cheshire, England. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 55,318 and the built-up area had a population of 74,120.

Crewe is perhaps best known as a large railway junction and home to Crewe Works; for many years, it was a major railway engineering facility for manufacturing and overhauling locomotives, but is now much reduced in size. From 1946 until 2002, it was also the home of Rolls-Royce motor car production. The Pyms Lane factory on the west of the town now exclusively produces Bentley motor cars. Crewe is north-west of London, south of Manchester city centre and south-east of Liverpool city centre.

==History==
=== Medieval ===
The name derives from an Old Welsh word &quot;criu&quot;, meaning &#x27;weir&#x27; or &#x27;crossing&#x27;. The earliest record is in the Domesday Book, where it is written as &quot;Creu&quot;. The original settlement of Crewe lies to the east of the modern town and was historically a township in the parish of Barthomley. The original settlement formally changed its name to Crewe Green in 1984 to distinguish it from the newer town to its west.

=== Modern ===
The town of Crewe owes its existence to Crewe railway station, which opened in 1837 on the Grand Junction Railway. When the route for the railway was being planned, alternative routes and locations for the main station in this area were considered; Winsford, 7 miles (11 km) to the north, had rejected an earlier proposal, as had local landowners in neighbouring Nantwich, 4 miles (6 km) away. The company then settled on the route through Crewe and the station was built in fields near Crewe Hall. The station was in the township of Crewe, but the land north-west of the station was in the neighbouring township of Monks Coppenhall, which formed part of the parish of Coppenhall.

The company built its main locomotive works to the north of Crewe railway station; a railway colony soon started developing in the area north-west of the station. In 1840, Joseph Locke, chief engineer of the Grand Junction Railway, produced plans for a new town there. The railway company built much of the early town itself in the 1840s and 1850s. Although the nascent town was in the township of Monks Coppenhall rather than the Crewe township, it was known as &quot;Crewe&quot; from the start. The modern town of Crewe was thus named after the railway station, rather than the other way round.

The population expanded rapidly to reach 40,000 by 1871. The town has a large park, Queen&#x27;s Park, laid out by engineer Francis Webb; the land for which was donated by the London and North Western Railway, the successor to the GJR. It has been suggested that their motivation was to prevent the rival Great Western Railway building a station on the site, but the available evidence indicates otherwise.

Webb took a great interest in local politics and was &quot;the most influential individual in the town&quot;. &quot;Described just before his retirement as &#x27;the King of Crewe&#x27;, Webb came to exercise control over the working lives of over 18,000 men - one third of the total LNWR workforce. Over half these lived in Crewe, around 8,000 being employed at the locomotive works. Several recreational and sporting organisations were a direct result of Webb&#x27;s influence and others received benefit from his support.&quot; These included the LNWR Cricket Club (established in 1850) and the Crewe Alexandra Athletic Club (established in 1867). However, Webb&#x27;s influence allegedly also extended to intimidation of Liberal Party supporters. In September 1885, the editor of the &quot;Crewe Chronicle&quot; published charges against Webb, saying &quot;That through the action, direct and indirect, of Tory railway officialism, the political life of Crewe is cramped and hindered beyond recognition&quot;. In November 1889, the borough council debated a motion which accused LNWR managers of working with Crewe Tories &quot;to crush Liberalism altogether out of the town&quot;: &quot;... by intimidation and persecution of your Liberal workmen, and by making the chances of promotion depend upon subserviency to the Tory political demands of the Management, they have created a state of political serfdom in the works.&quot; In December 1889, Liberal statesman William Ewart Gladstone wrote a letter to the &quot;Chronicle&quot; condemning the company&#x27;s behaviour in the town.

The railway provided an endowment towards the building and upkeep of Christ Church. Until 1897 its vicar, non-conformist ministers and schoolteachers received concessionary passes, the school having been established in 1842. The company provided a doctor&#x27;s surgery with a scheme of health insurance. A gasworks was built and the works water supply was adapted to provide drinking water and a public baths. The railway also opened a cheese market in 1854 and a clothing factory for John Compton who provided the company uniforms, while McCorquodale of Liverpool set up a printing works.

During World War II, the strategic presence of the railways and Rolls-Royce engineering works (turned over to producing aircraft engines) made Crewe a target for enemy air raids and it was in the flight path to Liverpool. The borough lost 35 civilians to these. The worst raid was on 29 August 1940 when some 50 houses were destroyed, close to the station.

Crewe crater on Mars is named after the town of Crewe. Crewe was described by author Alan Garner in his novel &quot;Red Shift&quot; as &quot;the ultimate reality.&quot;

Crewe was mentioned in 1984 as the setting of the 19th episode &quot;The Flying Kipper&quot;, in the first series of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;.

The town unsuccessfully bid for city status as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours in 2022.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Crewe, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Crewe Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at 1 Chantry Court on Forge Street. Cheshire East Council also has its main offices in the town, at Delamere House on Delamere Street, with the Municipal Buildings on Earle Street being used for some council meetings. Some outer parts of the built-up area (as defined by the Office for National Statistics) lie outside the parish, notably in the neighbouring parishes of Leighton, Woolstanwood, Wistaston, and Rope.

For national elections, the town forms part of the Crewe and Nantwich constituency.

===Administrative history===
The original settlement of Crewe was historically a township in the parish of Barthomley. The area where the modern town developed was in the neighbouring township of Monks Coppenhall, in the parish of Coppenhall. Both Barthomley and Coppenhall parishes formed part of the Nantwich hundred of Cheshire.

In 1859, the township of Monks Coppenhall was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. The district&#x27;s name was changed from Monks Coppenhall to Crewe in 1869. Townships were redefined as civil parishes in 1866, and whilst the local government district was renamed in 1869, the civil parish was not. As such, there was a Crewe district which contained the parish of Monks Coppenhall, but did not contain the parish of Crewe. An old, local riddle describes the somewhat unusual states of affairs: &quot;The place which is Crewe is not Crewe, and the place which is not Crewe is Crewe.&quot;

In 1877, the Crewe local government district was incorporated to become a municipal borough. The borough council later built the Municipal Buildings on Earle Street to serve as its headquarters, opening in 1905.

The railway station remained part of the neighbouring parish of Crewe, rather than the borough of Crewe, until 1936. The borough boundary was significantly enlarged in 1936 to absorb the parish of Church Coppenhall and parts of several other neighbouring parishes, including the area of Crewe parish around the railway station. The reduced Crewe parish to the east of the town formally changed its name to &quot;Crewe Green&quot; in 1984.

The borough of Crewe was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the larger borough of Crewe and Nantwich, also covering the nearby town of Nantwich and surrounding rural areas. The government originally proposed calling the new borough Crewe, but the shadow authority elected in 1973 to oversee the transition changed the name to &quot;Crewe and Nantwich&quot; before the new arrangements came into effect.

In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished. The area of the former borough of Crewe had been unparished since the 1974 reforms, but following the 2009 reforms it was decided to create a parish covering the area. A new parish of Crewe was therefore created in 2013, with its parish council taking the name Crewe Town Council.

==Climate==
Like most of the United Kingdom, Crewe has an oceanic climate, with warm summers and cool winters and relatively little temperature change throughout the year.

==Economy==
The railways still play a part in local industry at Crewe Works, which carries out train maintenance and inspection. It has been owned by Alstom since 2021. At its height, the site employed over 20,000 people but, by 2005, fewer than 1,000 remained, with a further 270 redundancies announced in November of that year. Currently Alstom employs 6,000 people across the UK and Ireland. Much of the site once occupied by the works has been sold and is now occupied by a supermarket, leisure park and a large new health centre.

There is still an electric locomotive maintenance depot to the north of the railway station, operated by DB Cargo UK. The diesel locomotive maintenance depot, having closed in 2003, reopened in 2015 as a maintenance facility for Locomotive Services Limited, having undergone major structural repairs.

The Bentley car factory is on Pyms Lane to the west of town. As of early 2010, there are about 3,500 working at the site. The factory used to produce Rolls-Royce cars, until the licence for the brand transferred from Bentley&#x27;s owners Volkswagen to rival BMW in 2003.

There is a BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments factory in the village of Radway Green near Alsager, producing small arms ammunition for the British armed forces.

The headquarters of Focus DIY, which went into administration in 2011, was in the town. Off-licence chain Bargain Booze is also Crewe-based; it was bought-out in 2018 by Sir Anwar Pervez&#x27; conglomerate Bestway for £7m, putting drinks retailing alongside its Manchester-based Well Pharmacy.

Several business parks around the town host light industry and offices. Crewe Business Park is a 67-acre site with offices, research and IT manufacturing. Major corporations with a presence in the park include Air Products, Barclays and Fujitsu. The 12-acre Crewe Gates Industrial Estate is adjacent to Crewe Business Park, with smaller industry including the ice cream van manufacturer Whitby Morrison. The Weston Gate area has light industry and distribution. Marshfield Bank Employment Park is to the west of the town and includes offices, manufacturing and distribution. There are industrial and light industrial units at Radway Green.

The town has two small shopping centres: the Victoria Centre and the Market Centre. There are outdoor markets throughout the week. Grand Junction Retail Park is just outside the centre of town. Nantwich Road provides a wide range of secondary local shops, with a variety of small retailers and estate agents.

The Market Centre is the largest shopping centre in Crewe. It is situated in the heart of the town centre with a few national retailers, including B&amp;M, Poundstretcher and Peacocks. There are three large car parks nearby and Crewe bus station is a five-minute walk from the shopping centre. It has a weekly footfall of approximately 100,000 visitors.

===Developments===
A planned redevelopment of Crewe&#x27;s town centre, including the current bus station and main shopping area, was abandoned because of &quot;difficult economic conditions&quot; during 2008.

There were also plans to revamp the railway station which involved moving it to Basford. This was pending a public consultation by Network Rail scheduled for autumn 2008, but no such public consultation was done. The plan was abandoned and maintenance work was carried out on the current station instead.

Cheshire East Council developed a new regeneration master plan for Crewe, which included the opening of a new Lifestyle Centre, with a new swimming pool, gym and library.

After a £3 million refurbishment, the Crewe Market Hall reopened its doors on 19 May 2021, the start of many new developments in Crewe.

Crewe had been planned as the site of a transport hub for the Phase 2a High Speed 2 (HS2) railway line, which received royal assent in 2021 with planned completion in 2027. The plan included a new HS2 railway station, surrounded by a commercial hub providing 37,000 jobs and 7,000 homes by 2043. However on 4 October 2023, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced the cancellation of this phase of the HS2 development at the Conservative Party Conference.

==Transport==

Crewe Heritage Centre is located in the old LMS railway yard for Crewe railway station. The museum has three signal boxes and an extensive miniature railway with steam, diesel and electric traction. The most prominent exhibit of the museum is the British Rail Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train.

The Grade II-listed Edwardian Lyceum Theatre is in the centre of Crewe. It was built in 1911 and shows drama, ballet, opera, music, comedy and pantomime. The theatre was originally located on Heath Street from 1882. The Axis Arts Centre is on the Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) campus in Crewe. It relocated from the university&#x27;s Alsager Campus when it closed. The centre has a programme of touring new performance and visual art work. The Axis centre closed at the end of the spring 2019 season with the withdrawal of MMU from the Crewe campus. The Box on Pedley Street is the town&#x27;s main local music venue.

Both the Lyceum Theatre and the Axis Arts Centre feature galleries. The private Livingroom art gallery is on Prince Albert Street. The town&#x27;s main library is on Prince Albert Square, opposite the Municipal Buildings.

Crewe has six Anglican churches, three Methodist, one Roman Catholic (which has a weekly Mass in Polish) and two Baptist.

There is a museum dedicated to Primitive Methodism in the nearby village of Englesea-Brook.

The Jacobean mansion Crewe Hall is located to the east of the town near Crewe Green. It is a grade I listed building, built in 1615–36 for Sir Randolph Crewe. Today, it is used as a hotel, restaurant and health club.

There is a multiplex Odeon cinema on Phoenix Leisure Park on the edge of the town centre, as well as a Mecca bingo hall and a Tenpin bowling alley.

Queens Park is the town&#x27;s main park; £6.5 million was spent on its restoration in 2010. It features walkways, a children&#x27;s play area, crown green bowling, putting, a boating lake, grassed areas, memorials and a café. Jubilee Gardens are in Hightown and there is also a park on Westminster Street.

In 2019, Crewe hosted Pride in the Park (previously held at Tatton Park in 2018) in Queens Park. The 2020 event, which had been due to take place on 12 September, was cancelled on 20 May, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

The daily &quot;Sentinel&quot; and the weekly &quot;Crewe Chronicle&quot; newspapers, both Reach plc-owned, cover the town. Reach&#x27;s &quot;CheshireLive&quot; is the digital news channel of the &quot;Crewe Chronicle&quot; and other Reach titles covering news across Cheshire, and has a section dedicated to Crewe news.

The local radio station is The Cat Community Radio, broadcasting on 107.9FM from the Cheshire College South and West building covering the town along with Nantwich and other local settlements. Other radio stations that cover the area include BBC Radio Stoke, Greatest Hits Radio Staffordshire &amp; Cheshire (formerly Signal 1) and Silk Radio from Macclesfield.

==Education==
Cheshire has adopted the comprehensive school model of secondary education, so all of the schools under its control cater for pupils of all levels of ability. Until the late 1970s Crewe had two grammar schools, Crewe Grammar School for Boys, now Ruskin High School and Crewe Grammar School for Girls, now the Oaks Academy (formerly Kings Grove School). The town&#x27;s two other secondary schools are Sir William Stanier School, a specialist technology and arts academy, and St. Thomas More Catholic High School, specialising in mathematics and computing and modern foreign languages.

Although there are eight schools for those aged 11–16 in Crewe and its surrounding area, Cheshire College South &amp; West is one of only two local providers of education for pupils aged 16 and over, and the only one in Crewe. The college also provides educational programmes for adults, leading to qualifications such as Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) or foundation degrees. In the 2006–07 academic year, 2,532 students aged 16–18 were enrolled, along with 3,721 adults.

Manchester Metropolitan University&#x27;s (MMU) Cheshire Faculty is based in Crewe, in a part of town which has been rebranded as the &quot;University Quadrant&quot;. The campus offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in five areas: business and management, contemporary arts, exercise and sport science, interdisciplinary studies, education and teacher training. The campus underwent a £70 million investment in its facilities and buildings in 2015. The campus was used as a pre-games training camp for the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Since 2016, there has been a University Technical College for 14-19 year olds interested in automotive or railway engineering.

==Sport==
Crewe&#x27;s local football club is Crewe Alexandra, founded in 1877 and initially managed by railway workers. During the late 20th century, the club enjoyed something of a renaissance under the management of Dario Gradi, playing in the second tier of the professional pyramid for eight seasons in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Crewe Alexandra currently plays in League Two (the fourth tier), having been relegated from League One in April 2022. In 2013, the club won its first major silverware after beating Southend United 2–0 in the EFL Trophy final at Wembley.

From the early 1980s, Crewe Alexandra built a reputation for developing young players through its youth ranks: England internationals Geoff Thomas, Danny Murphy, David Platt, Rob Jones and Dean Ashton, plus Northern Ireland&#x27;s Neil Lennon and Steve Jones, and Wales&#x27;s Robbie Savage and David Vaughan all passed through the club. Among their earlier most notable home-grown players was Frank Blunstone, born in the town in 1934, who was transferred from &quot;The Alex&quot; to Chelsea in 1953 and went on to win five England caps. Internationals Bruce Grobbelaar and Stan Bowles were also on the books at one time in their careers.

Crewe&#x27;s local rugby clubs are both based in or near Nantwich. The Crewe &amp; Nantwich Steamers (formerly Crewe Wolves), who played in the Rugby League Conference, were based at Barony Park, Nantwich, while Crewe and Nantwich RUFC play their home games at the Vagrants Sports Ground in Willaston.

Speedway racing was staged in Crewe in the pioneer days of the late 1920s to early 1930s; the stadium in Earle Street also operated from 1969 until 1975 when the Crewe Kings raced in British League Division Two, then the National League. At the time the track was the longest and fastest in the UK. Crewe Kings riders included Phil Crump (father of Jason Crump), Les Collins (brother of Peter Collins), Dave Morton (brother of Chris Morton), Geoff Curtis, John Jackson, Jack Millen and Dave Parry. Grand Junction Retail Park occupies the site of the now demolished stadium.

The Crewe Railroaders are the town&#x27;s American football team, currently competing in the BAFA Central League Division 2 and the subject of the film &quot;Gridiron UK&quot;, which premiered at the Lyceum Theatre on 29 September 2016.

Crewe also has its own roller derby team, Railtown Loco Rollers, founded in September 2013. They skate at Sir William Stanier Leisure Centre and compete with skaters and teams from all over the North West.

Crewe&#x27;s main leisure facility is the Crewe Lifestyle Centre, which now houses Crewe&#x27;s main public swimming pool after the Flag Lane premises closed in 2016. Other notable leisure facilities include Sir William Stanier Leisure Centre and Victoria Community Centre.

Since 17 February 2018, Crewe&#x27;s Queens Park has hosted a parkrun each Saturday morning at 9am.

<text>A major appliance, also known as a large domestic appliance or large electric appliance or simply a large appliance, large domestic, or large electric, is a non-portable or semi-portable machine used for routine housekeeping tasks such as cooking, washing laundry, or food preservation. Such appliances are sometimes collectively known as white goods, as the products were traditionally white in colour, although a variety of colours are now available. An appliance is different from a plumbing fixture because it uses electricity or fuel.

Major appliances differ from small appliances because they are bigger and not portable. They are often considered fixtures and part of real estate and as such they are often supplied to tenants as part of otherwise unfurnished rental properties. Major appliances may have special electrical connections, connections to gas supplies, or special plumbing and ventilation arrangements that may be permanently connected to the appliance. This limits where they can be placed in a home.

Since major appliances in a home consume a significant amount of energy, they have become the objectives of programs to improve their energy efficiency in many countries. Increasing energy efficiency is often described as an important element of climate change mitigation alongside other improvements like retrofitting buildings to increase building performance. Energy efficiency improvements may require changes in construction of the appliances, or improved control systems.

==Brands==

In the early days of electrification, many major consumer appliances were made by the same companies that made the generation and distribution equipment. While some of these brand names persist to the present day, even if only as licensed use of old popular brand names, today many major appliances are manufactured by companies or divisions of companies that specialize in particular appliances.

== Types ==

Major appliances may be roughly divided as follows:
*Refrigeration equipment
**Freezer
**Refrigerator
**Water cooler
**Ice maker
*Cooking
**Kitchen stove, also known as a range, cooker, oven, cooking plate, or cooktop
**Wall oven
**Steamer oven
**Microwave oven
*Washing and drying equipment
**Washing machine
**Clothes dryer
**Drying cabinet
**Dishwasher
*Heating and cooling
**Air conditioner
**Furnace
**Water heater
*Whole house ventilator
**Mechanical Air Ventilator

<doc id="176884" wikidata="Q619760" url="?curid=176884" title="Aposiopesis">
<text>Aposiopesis (; Classical Greek: ἀποσιώπησις, &quot;becoming silent&quot;) is a figure of speech wherein a sentence is deliberately broken off and left unfinished, the ending to be supplied by the imagination, giving an impression of unwillingness or inability to continue. An example would be the threat &quot;Get out, or else—!&quot; This device often portrays its users as overcome with passion (fear, anger, excitement) or modesty. To mark the occurrence of aposiopesis with punctuation, an em-rule (—) or an ellipsis (...) may be used.

== Examples ==
* One classical example of aposiopesis in Virgil occurs in Aeneid 1.135. Neptune, the Roman god of the Sea, is angry with the winds, whom Juno released to start a storm and harass the Trojan hero and protagonist Aeneas. Neptune berates the winds for causing a storm without his approval, but breaks himself off mid-threat:
*Another example in Virgil occurs in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; 2.100. Sinon, the Greek who is posing as a defector to deceive the Trojans into accepting the Trojan Horse within their city wall, tells about how Ulixes lied to spur on the war.
*For an example from classical Latin theater, this occurs multiple times in one speech in Terence&#x27;s Adelphoe, lines 159–140. In the play, Demea has two sons. He has given one to his brother Micio to raise. In the following scene, Demea has worked himself up in anger over his brother&#x27;s laxer parenting style. The following speech provides multiple examples of aposiopesis:
* A biblical example is found in Psalm 27, verse 13. It says: &quot;Unless I had believed I would see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living …&quot; The implication is that the author does not know what he would have done.
* King Lear, overcome by anger at his daughters, says:
&lt;poem&gt;
No, you unnatural hags,
I will have such revenges on you both,
That all the world shall— I will do such things,—
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
The terrors of the earth. (Shakespeare, &quot;King Lear&quot;, II.iv)
&lt;/poem&gt;

* Aposiopesis also occurs at the agitated climax of Mercutio&#x27;s &quot;Queen Mab&quot; speech, resulting in a calming intervention by Romeo:
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Mercutio&quot;. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
 That presses them and learns them first to bear,
 Making them women of good carriage:
 This is she—
&quot;Romeo&quot;. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
 Thou talk&#x27;st of nothing. (Shakespeare, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, I.iv)
&lt;/poem&gt;

* Dante Alighieri used an Aposiopesis in his Divine Comedy, Hell IX, 7-9 (citation from the translation by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) (Virgil speaks to himself):
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;“Still it behoveth us to win the fight,”&quot;
&quot;Began he; “else . . . Such offered us herself . . .&quot;
&quot;O how I long that some one here arrive!”&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Grammatical definition ==
In syntax, an aposiopesis arises when the &quot;if&quot; clause (protasis) of a condition is stated without an ensuing &quot;then&quot; clause, or apodosis. Because an aposiopesis implies the trailing off of thought, it is never directly followed by a period, which would effectively result in four consecutive dots.

<doc id="176885" wikidata="Q3308845" url="?curid=176885" title="Dario Gradi">
<text>Dario Gradi (born 8 July 1941) is an Italian-English former football player, coach and manager. He was associated for more than 36 years with Crewe Alexandra, where he was variously manager, director of football and director of the Academy, until October 2019.

Gradi played as an amateur for clubs in the London area (and won an England amateur cap); he then took on various coaching roles in the region. His first major managerial success was achieved with Wimbledon after which he briefly managed Crystal Palace in 1981.

Gradi had a 24-year first spell as manager of Crewe between 1983 and 2007. He stepped down from his managerial role in 2007, handing first-team responsibilities to Steve Holland, and became technical director. At that time, Gradi was the longest-serving manager of an English football league club. After two further spells as Crewe manager, he finally stepped down in November 2011 to focus on the club&#x27;s youth system, after managing Crewe in 1,359 first team games.

In late 2016, as the United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal expanded, Gradi&#x27;s roles at Crewe at the time of alleged offences in the 1980s and at Chelsea in the early 1970s were the subject of media scrutiny. The Chelsea allegations led to Gradi being suspended by The Football Association in November 2016. Gradi denied any wrongdoing and in February 2017 was planning an appeal against his FA suspension. However, he was heavily criticised by Chelsea&#x27;s inquiry report, published in August 2019, and in the FA&#x27;s Sheldon Report, published in March 2021 – when the FA said Gradi (who had retired from all football roles in October 2019) was &quot;effectively banned for life&quot; from football &quot;for safeguarding reasons&quot;. While accepting he had been suspended indefinitely from certain activities, Gradi said he had not been banned. Awarded an MBE for services to football in 1998, Gradi was stripped of the award in 2023 for failing to protect children from sexual abuse.

==Early life and playing career==
Born to an Italian father (who died when Dario was still a child) and an English mother, Gradi moved to London, aged four, when his mother returned after the Second World War in 1945.

He attended Glyn Grammar School in Epsom, and trained as a teacher of physical education at what is now Loughborough University from 1960 to 1963 (where he played for the university&#x27;s first XI football team, alongside Bob Wilson and Barry Hines), before returning to teach at his former school.

By this time he had already played as an amateur for Sutton United and for Tooting &amp; Mitcham United in the early 1960s. He was later capped once for England&#x27;s amateur side (playing in the team&#x27;s British Amateur Championship tie against Scotland in Dundee in September 1967). He later rejoined Sutton United, playing in the FA Amateur Cup Final against North Shields in April 1969, and in the club&#x27;s FA Cup 4th round tie against Leeds United in January 1970. Gradi also played for Wycombe Wanderers, long before the club became fully professional.

==Coaching career==
After a period of teaching, Gradi became a London regional coach for the FA; this caused him to lose his amateur status and become ineligible to continue his playing career. He had a spell coaching at east London&#x27;s Senrab F.C., and was appointed assistant coach at Chelsea in 1971 at the age of just 29. This was followed by coaching posts at Derby County (first team coach, 1977–78), and, later, a two-year spell at Leyton Orient (youth team coach, 1981–83).

==Managerial career==
===Sutton United===
Gradi managed Sutton United from 1976 to 1977.

===Wimbledon===
He took over as manager of Wimbledon in January 1978, helping the Plough Lane side win promotion from the Football League Fourth Division in 1978–79, although they were relegated after only one season in the Third Division. They were well on course for an immediate return to the Third Division when in February 1981 an offer came for Gradi to manage struggling First Division side Crystal Palace. Palace chairman Ron Noades had only recently left Wimbledon himself and saw Gradi as the ideal man to save his new purchase from relegation.

===Crystal Palace===
Gradi&#x27;s time at Selhurst Park was not a success, as he failed to save Crystal Palace from relegation, and he resigned the following November after a disappointing start to the 1981–82 season.

===Crewe Alexandra===
After a spell coaching at Leyton Orient, Gradi returned to management on 9 June 1983, when he accepted an offer to manage Crewe Alexandra, a team who regularly finished near the bottom of the Fourth Division and had been forced to apply for re-election on several occasions in order to avoid slipping into the Northern Premier League and, since its creation in 1979, the Football Conference. His first season signings included Mark Leonard from Tranmere Rovers, John Crabbe from Hereford United and David Pullar from Exeter City as Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his first transfer successes were Dave Waller (sold to Shrewsbury Town), Gary Blissett (sold to Brentford) and Geoff Thomas (sold to Crystal Palace); gradually the club moved forward.

In 1988–89, after six seasons of steady progress, they won promotion to end 25 years in the league&#x27;s basement division. Gradi signed a then unheard-of ten-year contract with Crewe. They went back down again two years later, but in 1994 won promotion to Division Two and three years after that they reached Division One for the first time in their history.

Shortly after the 1994 promotion, Gradi became the League&#x27;s longest-serving manager. By 2002 he was one of just two managers, the other being Alex Ferguson, to have held their position since before 1990. He later joined the club&#x27;s Board of Directors.

Gradi&#x27;s contract with Crewe was one of the most controversial in the Football League; it included a clause giving him a percentage of the profit on any player sold to another club.

====Talent spotting====

His keen eye for spotting and rearing young talent is what has gained him some recognition in football. He entered into discussions with Portugal&#x27;s Benfica over the vacant managerial spot in the 1980s, and was linked with the post of FA Technical Director in 1996.

During the 1980s and 1990s Gradi helped launch the careers of many players who went on to play top division and international football. These include David Platt, Rob Jones, Geoff Thomas, Danny Murphy, Ashley Ward, Wayne Collins, Seth Johnson, Robbie Savage and Neil Lennon. Gradi&#x27;s success continued into the 2000s, when he helped players including Rob Hulse, Dean Ashton, David Vaughan, Michael O&#x27;Connor, Billy Jones, Nicky Maynard and Ashley Westwood.

Crewe Alexandra won the PFA Bobby Moore Fair Play trophy 12 times in 15 years during Gradi&#x27;s reign.

====End of managerial career====
On 20 April 2007, Gradi announced that with effect from 1 July he would relinquish first-team responsibilities, becoming technical director while gradually handing over to new first-team coach Steve Holland, with Neil Baker remaining as assistant manager. Gradi was then the longest serving manager of an English Football League club. Gradi told the club website:
I didn&#x27;t want to be a 75-year-old manager working seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. That is not healthy for the future of the club. I will probably drop dead doing the job at some point but I wanted to put that day off a bit. This is a better way to do things, to introduce this gradual transition because it will take some of the workload off me.

On 18 November 2008, Gradi resumed control of Crewe&#x27;s first team on a caretaker basis after a poor start to the 2008–09 season under Steve Holland had left the club bottom of League One. He was in charge for just over a month before Gudjon Thordarson was announced as his successor on Christmas Eve 2008. Gradi remained in charge of the team for two games during the Christmas period, with Thordarson taking over on 29 December. Following the sacking of Thordarson on 2 October 2009, Gradi was again reinstated as caretaker manager which the board of directors then stated would be until further notice.

After returning as manager in 2009, on 10 November 2011 it was announced that Gradi had chosen to step down as manager, returning to his position as Director of Football. Gradi&#x27;s assistant manager Steve Davis, who had played for Crewe under Gradi from 1983 to 1987, was appointed as manager with immediate effect.

Gradi announced his retirement from all positions at Crewe Alexandra on 7 October 2019, at the age of 78, ending his 36-year association with the club.

==Honours and tributes==
In January 1998, Gradi was awarded an MBE for services to football, but was stripped of the award in 2023. In 2003 he was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Crewe and Nantwich and in the same year was awarded an honorary doctorate by Loughborough University.

In 2004, Gradi won the PFA Merit Award and was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame for his services to football. In 2011 at the Football League Awards Gradi was again honoured by his peers as he won the &#x27;Outstanding Contribution to League Football&#x27; for his work at Crewe. A street in Crewe, Dario Gradi Drive, is named in his honour. The winning school in the Surrey Schools Football Association&#x27;s boys under-13s competition receive the Dario Gradi Trophy.

==Alleged involvement in UK football sexual abuse scandal==
On 16 November 2016, former Crewe defender Andy Woodward revealed that he had been the victim of child sexual abuse by former football coach Barry Bennell (convicted in 1998) at the club in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-17/11/2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, six other individuals contacted the police, and on 22 November, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Crewe teammate Steve Walters had been another of Bennell&#x27;s victims. As Gradi had been manager at the time of the abuse, and as one attack was reported to have taken place at Gradi&#x27;s home but without his knowledge, Gradi was pressed to &quot;say more about what he knew and when.&quot; On 24 November, Gradi released a statement saying he knew nothing of Bennell&#x27;s crimes:

:I would like to express sympathy to the victims of Barry Bennell not only at Crewe Alexandra, but at other clubs in the North West. The first I knew of Barry Bennell&#x27;s crimes was when he was arrested in the United States in 1994. I knew nothing of his crimes before this time when he was employed by us. No-one at the Football Club knew of Bennell&#x27;s crimes until his arrest in 1994 and his subsequent prosecution in the United Kingdom. The football club also co-operated fully with the authorities in 2003. The club are in the process of a review and I won&#x27;t be making any further comment until this is finalised.&quot;

Also on 24 November, another ex-Crewe academy graduate Danny Murphy talked to the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; about Gradi:

:He was an amazing, generous, caring guy but he would never cross boundaries. I felt comfortable in his company. I felt safe in his home and under his guardianship. The more time I spent at Crewe, I notice the caution he exercised within his role. ... For example, he wouldn&#x27;t come into the bedroom to wake you up but he would always shout through the door. ... I hate the fact that he might be doubted in any way or even remotely linked to such negativity and bad things. My experience is totally the opposite. ... I believe that if he had known what Barry Bennell had been doing, he would have put a stop to it.

Similar character references were provided by former Crewe trainee, later &quot;Crewe Chronicle&quot; (and &quot;Cheshire Live&quot;) journalist, Peter Morse, and former defender David Wright.

On 3 December, &quot;The Independent&quot; reported an allegation from a former Chelsea youth player (later named as Eamonn Manners) that Gradi, then Chelsea&#x27;s assistant manager, visited the player&#x27;s family&#x27;s home to &quot;smooth over&quot; a complaint of sexual assault against Chelsea chief scout Eddie Heath in 1974. Gradi responded with a statement:

:Aside from denying any wrongdoing, it would be inappropriate and unfair on all parties to comment piecemeal through the media at this time in connection with historic allegations. Suffice to say, I will do everything within my power to assist all investigatory authorities into what is becoming a wide-ranging and important enquiry into historic sexual abuse.

On 6 December 2016, the Football Association announced the terms of reference of a review to be conducted by Clive Sheldon QC, and said Gradi would be among the first to be asked questions over the &quot;smoothing over&quot; allegation. In connection with these allegations, on 11 December 2016, the FA announced that it had suspended Gradi. Gradi subsequently said he had been notified by the FA of his interim suspension from football on 25 November, and reiterated &quot;that I will do everything within my power to assist all investigatory authorities.&quot;

On 7 December, the BBC reported that the mother of a former Crewe youth team player wrote an anonymous letter to Gradi in 1989–90, asking him to investigate &quot;inappropriate&quot; behaviour whereby a member of staff &quot;took lots of boys into his room overnight&quot; during a weekend away in Blackpool.

In February 2017, it was reported that Gradi planned to appeal against his FA suspension from football, feeling he had been left &quot;in limbo&quot;, but, a year later, he remained suspended from football. On 27 February 2018, claims were made that, in 2001, a former Crewe Alexandra employee was asked by a senior official at the club to help wipe pornography off Gradi&#x27;s home computer, which had been viewed by a group of Irish Under-13 players at his house.

In February 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported on a nine-page statement from Gradi about what he knew regarding Barry Bennell. Gradi admitted to encouraging a close player-coach culture and to not making detailed background checks about Bennell because Crewe was trying to poach him from Manchester City &quot;on the quiet&quot;. Club chairman John Bowler said Crewe had not appreciated the dangers of football being used as a means for a paedophile to prey on young boys (&quot;documented procedures that are now in place for the protection of minors were not in place at that time&quot;), while Gradi had not made detailed inquiries into Bennell&#x27;s background (&quot;He did not have any specific coaching qualifications but none were required and at the time the FA did not publish any guidance on child protection&quot;). However, former club secretary Gill Palin had been uncomfortable about Bennell.

In August 2019, Chelsea&#x27;s board apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot; for allowing Eddie Heath, a &quot;prolific and manipulative sexual abuser&quot;, to operate &quot;unchallenged&quot;. Its inquiry, led by barrister Charles Geekie QC, was also critical of former assistant manager Gradi. He was accused of failing to tell senior club staff about a sexual conduct allegation concerning Heath made by the parent of a young player. Gradi denied trying to &quot;smooth over&quot; the matter in a meeting with the boy&#x27;s father and said he had reported the allegations to Chelsea manager Ron Suart. Gradi was accused by Geekie of giving &quot;somewhat unlikely and unconvincing&quot; evidence; Geekie also rejected Gradi&#x27;s claim to have reported the matter to more senior staff, saying &quot;this was a significant personal failure by Mr Gradi. It was a lost opportunity to expose Mr Heath and prevent further abuse.&quot;

The FA&#x27;s 700-page Sheldon report was published on 17 March 2021, identifying failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at eight professional clubs including Crewe. Considering whether senior club people knew about Bennell, Sheldon concluded they had not received specific reports of abuse (a conclusion also reached by Cheshire constabulary). However, Norman Rowlinson, John Bowler and Hamilton Smith had discussed concerns about inappropriate behaviour; &quot;... during Bennell&#x27;s time at the Club, there were rumours circulating about [Bennell] and his sexual interest in children which were heard by some of the Club&#x27;s staff, including Dario Gradi.&quot; The club &quot;should have done more to check on the well-being of the boys&quot;, Sheldon said. Regarding the Chelsea allegations, Sheldon could not decide whether Gradi had informed the club&#x27;s acting manager, Ron Suart, of concerns raised at a meeting with the player&#x27;s father, but, either way, Sheldon said Gradi&#x27;s or Suart&#x27;s responses were inadequate. The FA&#x27;s CEO Mark Bullingham said Gradi was &quot;effectively banned for life&quot; from football; the FA legal director said it was &quot;for safeguarding reasons&quot; but that was &quot;as far as we can go&quot;. Child abuse survivors charity The Offside Trust called for Gradi to be stripped of his MBE, and for the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association and Football Hall of Fame to revoke other honours. Gradi was stripped of his MBE in August 2023, following a professional disbarment.

On 19 March 2021, Gradi apologised, saying: &quot;I wish to express my deepest sympathy for the survivors and their families. I sincerely and personally regret that the harm being caused to these young people was not discovered at the time. I apologise for not recognising any signs of abuse at the time.&quot; He also asserted that he had not been banned from all football-related activity – &quot;this is not the case&quot; he said. &quot;I am suspended indefinitely from certain specified activities with players under the age of 18 years and whilst I do not agree with it, I understand how the decision was arrived at.&quot;

==Managerial statistics==

1Gradi was absent from his post between 22 September and 17 October 2003, because of heart surgery. Assistant manager Neil Baker took charge of the team for this period (P6, W0, D1, L5).

<text>Duckman: Private Dick/Family Man, commonly known simply as Duckman, is an American adult animated sitcom created and developed by Everett Peck, based on the characters he created in his 1990 one-shot comic book published by Dark Horse Comics. &quot;Duckman&quot; aired on the USA Network from March 5, 1994, through September 6, 1997, for 4 seasons and 70 episodes. It follows Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by Jason Alexander), a private detective who lives with his family.

After airing in syndication, the series gained a cult following. Spin-off media include volume DVDs released from 2008 to 2009, a comic book collection released by Topps between 1994 and 1996, a &quot;Complete Series&quot; DVD set released in 2018, and a video game entitled &quot;&quot; for Microsoft Windows. The series was listed among &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows&quot; in 2009 and received three nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards.

==Plot==

In a universe where humans and anthropomorphic animals coexist, the series centers on Eric Tiberius Duckman (voiced by Jason Alexander), a widowed, lewd, self-hating, egocentric anthropomorphic duck who lives with his family in Los Angeles (as mentioned in the episode &quot;Bev Takes a Holiday&quot;) and works as a private detective. The tagline of the show, seen in the opening credits, is &quot;Private Dick/Family Man&quot;.

Main characters include Cornfed (voiced by Gregg Berger), a pig who is Duckman&#x27;s Joe Friday–esque business partner and best friend; Ajax (voiced by Dweezil Zappa), Duckman&#x27;s eldest, slow-witted teenage son; Charles (voiced by Dana Hill and later Pat Musick) and Mambo (voiced by E. G. Daily), Duckman&#x27;s genius conjoined twins whose heads share a body; Bernice (voiced by Nancy Travis), the identical twin of Duckman&#x27;s presumed-dead wife Beatrice, a fanatical fitness buff who hates Duckman with a passion; and Grandma-ma (voiced by Travis), Duckman&#x27;s comatose, immensely flatulent mother-in-law.

Recurring characters include Agnes Delrooney (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray), Grandma-ma&#x27;s doppelgänger who kidnaps her and poses as her until near the end of the final season; Fluffy and Uranus (voiced by Musick), Duckman&#x27;s two obsessively politically correct Care Bear–esque pink and blue teddy bear office assistants; George Herbert Walker &quot;King&quot; Chicken (voiced by Tim Curry), a supervillain who schemes to ruin Duckman&#x27;s life as retribution for ruining his high school tenure; Beverly (voiced by Travis), Beatrice and Bernice&#x27;s long-lost sister; and Gecko, Duckman&#x27;s pet dog (which he had stolen).

In the final episode, four couples (Dr. Stein/Dana Reynard, Duckman/Honey, King Chicken/Bernice, Cornfed/Beverly) get married – the last three in a joint ceremony. The kids, Fluffy and Uranus, and a number of characters from previous episodes are in attendance. As the ceremonies draw to a close, Beatrice (Duckman&#x27;s supposedly deceased wife) appears and shocks the entire crowd. When Duckman asks how she can still be alive, Beatrice indicates Cornfed always knew. Cornfed says, &quot;I can explain.&quot; The show then ends with &quot;To be continued...?&quot; superimposed on the screen. In regards to this cliffhanger, &quot;Duckman&quot; writer Michael Markowitz offered the following shortly after the series came to an end: &quot;We never formally planned Part II... and I&#x27;ll never tell what I personally had in mind. I&#x27;m hoping to leave it to my heirs, for the inevitable day when Duckman is revived by future generations.&quot; On August 13, 2015, Markowitz posted on his Twitter page in response to a question from a fan about the cliffhanger, &quot;Was then (&amp; now) an #XFiles fan (bride in ep was Dana Reynard, a Mulder-Scully hint) so involved gov&#x27;t coverup of aliens&quot;.

==Production==
The series consists of 70 episodes that aired on Saturday nights from 1994 to 1997 on the USA Network. It later reran on Comedy Central from 2000 to 2006. In Spain, it aired on Canal+ in the 1990s and on Cartoon Network from 2000 to 2001 through a nightly block aimed at adults, vaguely as a pre-beta to Adult Swim, both times alongside &quot;The Critic&quot;. In the United Kingdom, it aired on Sky 1 and BBC Two, and in Canada, it is a former program on MTV2 and Teletoon. The initial showrunners were Peck, Reno and Osborn, and the show was produced in association with Paramount Network Television. Klasky Csupo animated and produced the show; around the same time, they were also producing &quot;Aaahh!!! Real Monsters&quot; on Nickelodeon. In later years, the show running duties went to David Misch and Michael Markowitz. Creator and executive producer Everett Peck was with the show for its entire run. Producer Gene Laufenberg was with the show for most of its run. Scott Wilk and Todd Yvega created original music for the series, including the theme. The first season also featured music from Frank Zappa&#x27;s published catalog (Zappa died several months prior to this series&#x27; premiere).

==Episodes==

==Merchandise==

===Comic books===
Between 1994 and 1996 various comic books were published by Topps based on the TV series. These were largely written and drawn by others, including Jay Lynch, Scott Shaw! and Craig Yoe. Topps also reprinted Peck&#x27;s original 1990 &quot;Duckman&quot; comic.

===Home media===
In January 2008, TVShowsOnDVD.com reported that &quot;Duckman&quot; would be coming to region 1 DVD. Details followed in May, when it was announced that the first release in the series would be the first two seasons, 22 combined episodes on three discs, on September 16, 2008. The final two seasons, 48 episodes, were released on a seven-disc set on January 6, 2009. Both DVD sets were released by CBS DVD/Paramount Home Entertainment.

With the DVD releases, many episodes were edited to remove copyrighted music because of royalty issues, and as a result they differ somewhat from the aired TV episodes, though Everett Peck was involved in the process of the DVD releases and he felt the most important music was preserved.

The &quot;Complete Series&quot; DVD was released on February 6, 2018.

===Video game===
In May 1997, a point-and-click adventure computer game, &quot;&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows. In it, Duckman has become a famous detective, and a television series based on him is about to debut, but someone is pushing Duckman out of his own life and replacing him with a bigger, better, heroic Duckman. The player&#x27;s goal is to help Duckman get rid of the impostor and reclaim his rightful place. A PlayStation port was planned for a release in the first quarter of 1997 but it was cancelled.

==Reception==
The show was critically acclaimed. In January 2009, &quot;IGN&quot; listed &quot;Duckman&quot; as the 48th best in the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.

Episodes &quot;T.V. or Not to Be&quot;, &quot;Noir Gang&quot;, and &quot;Haunted Society Plumbers&quot; were nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program in 1994, 1996, and 1997, respectively.

<doc id="176894" wikidata="Q310886" url="?curid=176894" title="Hissène Habré">
<text>Hissène Habré (Arabic: &quot;Ḥusaīn Ḥabrī&quot;, Chadian Arabic: ; ; 13 August 1942 – 24 August 2021), also spelled Hissen Habré, was a Chadian politician and convicted war criminal who served as the 5th president of Chad from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990.

A Muslim from northern Chad, Habré joined FROLINAT rebels in the first Chadian Civil War against the southern-dominated Chadian government. Due to a rift with fellow rebel commander Goukouni Oueddei, Habré and his Armed Forces of the North rebel army briefly defected to Felix Malloum&#x27;s government against Oueddei before turning against Malloum, who resigned in 1979. Habré was then given the position of Minister of Defense under Chad&#x27;s new transitional coalition government, with Oueddei as President. Their alliance quickly collapsed, and Habré&#x27;s forces overthrew Oueddei in 1982.

Having become the country&#x27;s new president, Habré created the National Union for Independence and Revolution (UNIR) as the country&#x27;s sole legal party in 1984. His dictatorship was notorious for widespread human rights abuses by his secret police, the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS). He was brought to power with the support of France and the United States, who provided training, arms, and financing throughout his rule due to his opposition to Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. He led the country during the Libyan-Chadian conflict, culminating in victory during the Toyota War from 1986 to 1987 with French support. He was overthrown three years later in the 1990 Chadian coup d&#x27;état by Idriss Déby and fled into exile in Senegal.

In May 2016, Habré was found guilty by an international tribunal in Senegal of human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison. He was the first former head of state to be convicted for human rights abuses in the court of another nation. He died on 24 August 2021, after testing positive for COVID-19.

==Early life==
Habré was born in 1942 in Faya-Largeau, northern Chad, then a colony of France, into a family of shepherds. He was a member of the Anakaza branch of the Daza Gourane ethnic group, which is itself a branch of the Toubou ethnic group. After primary schooling, he obtained a post in the French colonial administration, where he impressed his superiors and gained a scholarship to study in France at the Institute of Higher International Studies in Paris. He completed a university degree in political science in Paris, and returned to Chad in 1971. He also obtained several other degrees and earned his Doctorate from the Institute. After a further brief period of government service as a deputy prefect, he visited Tripoli and joined the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) where he became a commander in the Second Liberation Army of FROLINAT along with Goukouni Oueddei. After Abba Siddick assumed the leadership of FROLINAT, the Second Liberation Army, first under Oueddei&#x27;s command and then under Habré&#x27;s, split from FROLINAT and became the Command Council of the Armed Forces of the North (CCFAN). In 1976 Oueddei and Habré quarreled and Habré split his newly named Armed Forces of the North (&quot;Forces Armées du Nord&quot; or FAN) from Goukouni&#x27;s followers who adopted the name of People&#x27;s Armed Forces (&quot;Forces Armées Populaires&quot; or FAP).

Habré first came to international attention when a group under his command attacked the town of Bardaï in Tibesti, on 21 April 1974, and took three Europeans hostage, with the intention of ransoming them for money and arms. The captives were a German physician, Christoph Staewen (whose wife Elfriede was killed in the attack), and two French citizens, Françoise Claustre, an archeologist, and Marc Combe, a development worker. Staewen was released on 11 June 1974 after significant payments by West German officials. Combe escaped in 1975, but despite the intervention of the French Government, Claustre (whose husband was a senior French government official) was not released until 1 February 1977. Habré split with Oueddei, partly over this hostage-taking incident (which became known as the &quot;Claustre affair&quot; in France).

==Rise to power==
In August 1978 Habré was given the posts of Prime Minister of Chad and Vice President of Chad as part of an alliance with Gen. Félix Malloum. However, the power-sharing alliance did not last long. In February 1979 Habré&#x27;s forces and the national army under Malloum fought in N&#x27;Djamena. The fighting effectively left Chad without a national government. Several attempts were made by other nations to resolve the crisis, resulting in a new national government in November 1979 in which Habré was appointed Minister of Defense. However, fighting resumed within a matter of weeks. In December 1980 Habré was driven into exile in Sudan. In 1982 he resumed his fight against the Chadian government. FAN won control of N&#x27;Djamena in June and appointed Habré as head of state.

==Rule==

Habré seized power in Chad and ruled from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990 by Idriss Déby. Habré&#x27;s one-party &quot;régime&quot; was characterized by widespread human rights abuses and atrocities. He denied killing and torturing tens of thousands of his opponents, although in 2012 the United Nations&#x27; International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Senegal to put him on trial or extradite him to face justice overseas.

Following his rise to power Habré created a secret police force known as the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS), under which his opponents were tortured and executed. Some methods of torture commonly used by the DDS included burning the body of the detainee with incandescent objects, spraying gas into their eyes, ears and nose, forced swallowing of water, and forcing the mouths of detainees around the exhaust pipes of running automobiles. Habré&#x27;s government also periodically engaged in ethnic cleansing against groups such as the Sara, Hadjerai and the Zaghawa, killing and arresting group members en masse when it was perceived that their leaders posed a threat to the regime.

Habré fled, with $11 million of public money, to Senegal after being overthrown in 1990. He was placed under house arrest in 2005 until his arrest in 2013. He was accused of war crimes and torture during his eight years in power in Chad, where rights groups say that some 40,000 people were killed under his rule. Human Rights Watch claims that 1,200 were killed and 12,000 were tortured, and a domestic Chadian commission of inquiry claims that as many as 40,000 were killed and that more than 200,000 were subjected to torture. Human Rights Watch later dubbed Habré &quot;Africa&#x27;s Pinochet.&quot;

==War with Libya==
Libya invaded Chad in July 1980, occupying and annexing the Aozou Strip. The United States and France responded by aiding Chad in an attempt to contain Libya&#x27;s regional ambitions under Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi.

In 1980, the unity government signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation with Libya. The treaty allowed the Chadian government to call on Libya for assistance if Chad&#x27;s independence or internal security was threatened. The Libyan army was soon assisting the government forces, under Goukouni, and ousted FAN from much of northern Chad, including N&#x27;Djamena on 15 December. Libyan troops withdrew in November 1981. Without their support, Goukouni&#x27;s government troops were weakened and Habré capitalized on this and his FAN militia entered N&#x27;Djamena on 7 June 1982. In 1983, Libyan troops returned to Chad and remained in the country, supporting Goukouni&#x27;s militia, until 1988.

Despite this victory, Habré&#x27;s government was weak, and strongly opposed by members of the Zaghawa ethnic group. A rebel offensive in November 1990, which was led by Idriss Déby, a Zaghawa former army commander who had participated in a plot against Habré in 1989 and subsequently fled to Sudan, defeated Habré&#x27;s forces. The French chose not to assist Habré on this occasion, allowing him to be ousted; it is possible that they actively aided Déby. Explanation and speculation regarding the reasons for France&#x27;s abandonment of Habré include the adoption of a policy of non-interference in intra-Chadian conflicts, dissatisfaction with Habré&#x27;s unwillingness to move towards multiparty democracy, and favoritism by Habré towards U.S.
rather than French companies with regard to oil development. Habré fled to Cameroon, and the rebels entered N&#x27;Djamena on 2 December 1990; Habré subsequently went into exile in Senegal.

==Support of the U.S. and France==


The United States and France supported Habré, seeing him as a bulwark against the Gaddafi government in neighboring Libya. Under President Ronald Reagan, the United States gave covert CIA paramilitary support to help Habré take power and remained one of Habré&#x27;s strongest allies throughout his rule, providing his regime with massive amounts of military aid. The United States also used a clandestine base in Chad to train captured Libyan soldiers whom it was organizing into an anti-Qaddafi force.

&quot;The CIA was so deeply involved in bringing Habré to power I can&#x27;t conceive they didn&#x27;t know what was going on,&quot; said Donald Norland, U.S. ambassador to Chad from 1979 to 1981. &quot;But there was no debate on the policy and virtually no discussion of the wisdom of doing what we did.&quot;

Documents obtained by Human Rights Watch show that the United States provided Habré&#x27;s DDS with training, intelligence, arms, and other support despite knowledge of its atrocities. Records discovered in the DDS&#x27; meticulous archives describe training programs by U.S.
instructors for DDS agents and officials, including a course in the United States that was attended by some of the DDS&#x27; most feared torturers. According to the Chadian Truth Commission, the United States also provided the DDS with monthly infusions of monetary aid and financed a regional network of intelligence networks code-named &quot;Mosaic&quot; that Chad used to pursue suspected opponents of Habré&#x27;s regime even after they fled the country.

In the summer of 1983, when Libya invaded northern Chad and threatened to topple Habré, France sent paratroops with air support, while the Reagan administration provided two AWACS electronic surveillance planes to coordinate air cover. By 1987 Gaddafi&#x27;s forces had retreated.

&quot;Habré was a remarkably able man with a brilliant sense of how to play the outside world,&quot; a former senior U.S. official said. &quot;He was also a bloodthirsty tyrant and torturer. It is fair to say we knew who and what he was and chose to turn a blind eye.&quot;

==Legal proceedings==
===Allegations of crimes against humanity===
Human rights groups hold Habré responsible for the killing of thousands of people, but the exact number is unknown. Killings included massacres against ethnic groups in the south (1984), against the Hadjerai (1987), and against the Zaghawa (1989). Human Rights Watch charged him with having authorized tens of thousands of political murders and physical torture. Habré had been called &quot;the African Pinochet,&quot; in reference to former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Habre would personally sign death warrants and oversee torture sessions, and was accused of personally participating in torture and rape. According to some leading experts, the tribunal that judges him constituted an &quot;internationalized tribunal&quot;, even if it is the most &#x27;national&#x27; within this category&quot;.

The government of Idriss Déby established a Commission of Inquiry into the Crimes and Misappropriations Committed by Ex-President Habré, His Accomplices and/or Accessories in 1990, which reported that 40,000 people had been killed, but did not follow up on its recommendations.

===Initial trial attempts===
Between 1993 and 2003, Belgium had universal jurisdiction legislation (the Belgian War Crimes Law) allowing the most serious violations of human rights to be tried in national as well as international courts, without any direct connection to the country of the alleged perpetrator, the victims or where the crimes took place. Despite the repeal of the legislation, investigations against Habré went ahead and in September 2005 he was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes, and other human rights violations. Senegal, where Habré had been in exile for 17 years, had Habré under nominal house arrest in Dakar.

On 17 March 2006, the European Parliament demanded that Senegal turn over Habré to Belgium to be tried. Senegal did not comply, and it at first refused extradition demands from the African Union which arose after Belgium asked to try Habré. The Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights expressed its approval of the decision. If he had been turned over, he would have become the first former dictator to be extradited by a third-party country to stand trial for human rights abuses. In 2007, Senegal set up its own special war-crimes court to try Habré under pressure from the African Union. On 8 April 2008, the National Assembly of Senegal voted to amend the nation&#x27;s constitution to clear the way for Habré to be prosecuted in Senegal; Ibrahima Gueye was appointed trial coordinator in May 2008. A joint session of the National Assembly and the Senate voted in July 2008 to approve a bill empowering Senegalese courts to try people for crimes committed in other countries and for crimes that were committed more than ten years beforehand; this made it constitutionally possible to try Habré. Senegalese Minister of Justice Madicke Niang appointed four investigative judges on this occasion.

A 2007 movie by director Klaartje Quirijns, &quot;The Dictator Hunter&quot;, tells the story of the activists Souleymane Guengueng and Reed Brody who led the efforts to bring Habré to trial.

===Trial in Chad===
On 15 August 2008, a Chadian court sentenced Habré to death &quot;in absentia&quot; for war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with allegations that he had worked with rebels inside Chad to oust Déby. François Serres, a lawyer for Habré, criticized this trial on 22 August for unfairness and secrecy. According to Serres, the accusation on which the trial was based was previously unknown and Habré had not received any notification of the trial. 14 victims filed new complaints with a Senegalese prosecutor on 16 September, accusing Habré of crimes against humanity and torture.

===Trial in Senegal===
The Senegalese government added an amendment in 2008, which would allow Habré to be tried in court. Senegal later changed their position, however, requesting 27 million euros in funding from the international community before going through with the trial. This prompted Belgium to pressure the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to force Senegal to either extradite Habré to Belgium or to proceed with the trial. The ICJ declined to force extradition, finding that prosecution is an international obligation the violation of which is a wrongful act engaging the responsibility of the State, while extradition is an option offered to the State. Senegal was found to have failed international obligations by 1.) failing to make immediately a preliminary inquiry into the fact relating to the alleged crimes; and 2.) failing to submit the case to its competent authorities for prosecution (obligations according to UN Convention on Torture and Other Cruel, inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1984) that Senegal had bound itself to). The ICJ rejected Senegal Defenses of insufficient funds and opposition by domestic law, instead unanimously ordering Senegal to submit the case to authorities for prosecution or extradite him without delay.

In November 2010, the court of justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ruled that Senegal could not hold trial in the matter through local court only, and asked for the creation of a special tribunal on the matter of Habré&#x27;s prosecution. In April 2011, after initial reticence, Senegal agreed to the creation of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; tribunal in collaboration with the African Union, the Chadian state and with international funding.

Senegal changed their position again however, walking out during discussions on establishing the court on 30 May 2011 without explanation. The African union commission on Habré, in preparation for their next summit on 30 June, published a report which urged pressing Senegal to extradite Habré to Belgium.

On 8 July 2011, Senegalese officials announced that Habré would be extradited to Chad on 11 July, but this was subsequently halted. In July 2012, the ICJ ruled that Senegal must start Habré&#x27;s trial &quot;without delay&quot;. Amnesty International called on Senegal to abide by the ICJ&#x27;s ruling, calling it &quot;a victory for victims that&#x27;s long overdue&quot;. A trial by the International Criminal Court (ICC) was ruled out, because the crimes took place before the ICC was fully established in 2002, and its jurisdiction is limited to events that took place after that date.

In December 2012, the Parliament of Senegal passed a law allowing for the creation of an international tribunal in Senegal to try Habre. The judges of the tribunal would be appointed by the African Union, and come from elsewhere in Africa.

On 30 June 2013, Habré was arrested in Senegal by the Senegalese police. Chadian President Idriss Déby said of his arrest that it was a step towards &quot;an Africa free of all evil, an Africa stripped of all dictatorships.&quot; Senegal&#x27;s court, set up with the African Union, charged him with crimes against humanity and torture. That year he was also sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity by a Chadian court. The Tribunal that judged Hissène Habré in Sénégal is said to have a huge range of specificities.

On 20 July 2015 the trial started. Waiting for the trial to open, Habré shouted: &quot;Down with imperialists. [The trial] is a farce by rotten Senegalese politicians. African traitors. Valet of America&quot;. After that Habré was taken out of the courtroom and the trial began without him. On 21 July 2015 Habré&#x27;s trial was postponed to 7 September 2015, after his lawyers refused to participate in court.

===Conviction by the Special Tribunal in Senegal===
On 30 May 2016, the Extraordinary African Chambers found Habré guilty of rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people during his tenure as Chadian president and sentenced him to life in prison in the Prison du Cap Manuel in Senegal. The verdict marked the first time an African Union-backed court convicted a former ruler for human-rights abuses and the first time that the courts of one country have prosecuted the former ruler of another country for crimes against humanity. In May 2017, Judge Ougadeye Wafi upheld Habre&#x27;s life sentence and all convictions against him, except rape. The court emphasized this was a procedural matter, as the facts the victim offered during her testimony came too late in the proceedings to be included within charges of mass sexual violence committed by his security agents, the convictions for which were upheld. On 7 April 2020, a judge in Senegal granted Habre two months&#x27; leave from prison, as the jail is being used to hold new detainees in COVID-19 quarantine.
After finishing his home freedom he returned to prison on 7 June.

<text>Charles Russell McCarron (1891 – January 27, 1919) was a United States Tin Pan Alley and vaudeville composer and lyricist.

He was born in Janesville, Wisconsin. His father John H. McCarron was a veteran vaudeville actor and manager. He moved to New York in 1912.

Some of his best known songs include &quot;I Am Glad I Can Make You Cry&quot; and &quot;When the Sun Goes Down in Dixie&quot;. McCarron also wrote WWI songs, including &quot;Your Lips Are No Man&#x27;s Land But Mine&quot;, &quot;Our Country&#x27;s in It Now! (We&#x27;ve Got to Win It Now)&quot;, and &quot;The Russians Were Rushin&#x27;, The Yanks Started Yankin&#x27;. He collaborated with other composers including Albert Von Tilzer, Carey Morgan, and Chris Smith.

He composed for many vaudeville acts, including Bessie Clayton, Corinne Tilton, Harry Cooper, Mabel McCain, Nevins and Gordon, and Jimmie and Minnie Allen. His biggest productions were for Lucille Cavanagh&#x27;s &quot;kaleidoscope of dance, color and song&quot; vaudeville program that toured for several years (Dave Stamper would provide the music for later versions), for Evelyn Nesbit&#x27;s return to vaudeville &quot;A Roseland Fantasy&quot; in 1917.

He died of pneumonia at his home in New York on January 27, 1919 at age 27. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery.

<text>Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry (born Rainford Hugh Perry; 20 March 1936 – 29 August 2021) was a Jamaican record producer, songwriter and singer noted for his innovative studio techniques and production style. Perry was a pioneer in the 1970s development of dub music with his early adoption of remixing and studio effects to create new instrumental or vocal versions of existing reggae tracks. He worked with and produced for a wide variety of artists, including Bob Marley and the Wailers, Junior Murvin, the Congos, Max Romeo, Adrian Sherwood, Beastie Boys, Ari Up, the Clash, the Orb, and many others.

== Early life ==
Rainford Hugh Perry was born on 20 March 1936 in Kendal, Jamaica, in the parish of Hanover, the third child of Ina Davis and Henry Perry. His mother had strong African traditions originating from her Yoruba ancestry that she passed on to her son. His parents were both laborers, but his father later became a professional dancer.

Lee left school at age 15 and lived in Hanover, working as a labourer to help build the first road in Negril. He eventually wound up in Clarendon where he got into the dance and music scene and earned the nickname &quot;The Neat Little Thing&quot;. Lee later moved to Kingston after experiencing a mystical connection to stones (&quot;When the stones clash, I hear like the thunder clash... and I hear words... These words send me to Kingston. Kingston means King&#x27;s Stone, the Son of the King... the stone that I was throwing in Negril send me to King Stone for my graduation.&quot;) where he apprenticed at Studio One.

==Career==
===Early work===
Perry&#x27;s musical career began in the late 1950s as a record seller for Clement Coxsone Dodd&#x27;s sound system. As his sometimes turbulent relationship with Dodd developed, he found himself performing a variety of important tasks at Dodd&#x27;s Studio One hit factory, going on to record nearly thirty songs for the label. Disagreements between the pair due to personality and financial conflicts led him to leave the studio and seek new musical outlets. He soon found a new home at Joe Gibbs&#x27;s Amalgamated Records.

Working with Gibbs, Perry continued his recording career but, once again, financial problems caused conflict. Perry broke ranks with Gibbs and formed his own label, Upsetter Records, in 1968. His first major single &quot;People Funny Boy&quot;, which was an insult directed at Gibbs, sold well with 60,000 copies sold in Jamaica alone. It is notable for its innovative use of a sample (a crying baby) as well as a fast, chugging beat that would soon become identifiable as &quot;reggae&quot;. Similarly his acrimonious 1967 single as Lee &quot;King&quot; Perry, &quot;Run for Cover&quot;, was likewise aimed at Sir Coxsone.

From 1968 until 1972, he worked with his studio band the Upsetters. During the 1970s, Perry released numerous recordings on a variety of record labels that he controlled, and many of his songs were popular in both Jamaica and the United Kingdom, where his instrumental &quot;The Return of Django&quot; was a top five hit in 1969. He soon became known for his innovative production techniques as well as his eccentric character.

In 1970, Perry produced and released the Wailers track &quot;Mr. Brown&quot; (1970) with its unusual use of studio effects and eerie opening highlighting his unique approach to production.

===The Black Ark===
In 1973, Perry built a studio in his back yard, the Black Ark, to have more control over his productions and continued to produce notable musicians such as Bob Marley and the Wailers, Junior Byles, Junior Murvin, the Heptones, the Congos, and Max Romeo. He also started the Black Ark label, on which many of the productions from the studio appeared. With his own studio at his disposal, Perry&#x27;s productions became more lavish, as the energetic producer was able to spend as much time as he wanted on the music he produced. Virtually everything Perry recorded in The Black Ark was done using basic recording equipment; through sonic sleight-of-hand, Perry made it sound unique. Paul Douglas mentions: &quot;Scratch had a particular sound and everybody was fascinated by his sound. He had this way of putting things together; it was just his sound and it influenced a lot of people. I’ve even gone to the Black Ark with Eric Gale for that Negril album; I remember myself and Val Douglas, we laid some tracks there, Eric Gale overdubbed stuff on there, but I honestly don&#x27;t remember what happened to it.&quot;

Perry remained behind the mixing desk for many years, producing songs and albums that stand out as a high point in reggae history. He was known to remain in the studio for days at a time when mixing, taking no visitors or calls, and very little food or drink.

By 1978, stress and unwanted outside influences began to take their toll: both Perry and the Black Ark quickly fell into a state of disrepair. Eventually, the studio burned to the ground. Perry has constantly insisted that he burned the Black Ark himself in a fit of rage.

===After the Black Ark (1980s and 1990s)===

After the demise of the Black Ark in the early 1980s, Perry spent time in England and the United States, performing live and making erratic records with a variety of collaborators. His career took a new path in 1984 when he met Mark Downie (Marcus Upbeat) with whom he worked on the 1986 album &quot;Battle of Armagideon&quot; for Trojan. It was not until the late 1980s, when he began working with British producers Adrian Sherwood and Neil Fraser (who is better known as Mad Professor), that Perry&#x27;s career began to get back on solid ground again. Perry also attributed a later resurgence of his creative muse to his deciding to quit drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis. In his earlier days, the act of producing for Perry was a frenzied and ritualistic one where he stated that &quot;he blew smoke into the microphone so that the weed would get into the song.&quot; Perry stated in an interview that he wanted to see if &quot;it was the smoke making the music or Lee Perry making the music. I found out it was me and that I don&#x27;t need to smoke.&quot;

In 1998, Perry reached a wider global audience as vocalist on the track &quot;Dr. Lee, PhD&quot; from the Beastie Boys&#x27; album &quot;Hello Nasty&quot;.

===Later career===
In 2003, Perry won a Grammy for Best Reggae Album with the album &quot;Jamaican E.T.&quot; In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Perry number 100 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He teamed up with a group of Swiss musicians and performed under the name Lee Perry and the White Belly Rats, and toured the United States in 2006 and 2007 using the New York City-based group Dub Is a Weapon as his backing band.

After meeting Andrew W.K. at SXSW in 2006, Perry invited him to co-produce his album &quot;Repentance&quot;. The album, released on 19 August 2008 through Narnack Records, featured several guest artists including Moby, Ari Up, producer Don Fleming, drummer Brian Chippendale, and bassist Josh Werner.

In 2007, Perry&#x27;s song &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; was sampled on the track &quot;Carrots&quot; by Panda Bear of Animal Collective. As well, Perry was selected by Animal Collective in 2011 to perform at All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties, which the band curated in May 2011. That same year, he recorded &quot;Rise Again&quot; with bassist and producer Bill Laswell; the album featured contributions from Tunde Adebimpe, Sly Dunbar, and Bernie Worrell, and was released on Laswell&#x27;s M.O.D. Technologies label.

In 2008, Perry reunited with Adrian Sherwood on &quot;The Mighty Upsetter.&quot; Between 2007 and 2010, Perry recorded three albums with British producer Steve Marshall who he met at Pyramid Arts Development in Hackney. The albums featured performances by Keith Richards and George Clinton. Two of these albums, &quot;End of an American Dream&quot; (2008) and &quot;Revelation&quot; (2010), received Grammy nominations in the category Best Reggae Album.

In 2009, Perry collaborated with Dubblestandart on their &quot;Return from Planet Dub&quot; double album, revisiting some of his material from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as collaborating on new material with Dubblestandart, some of which also included Ari Up of the Slits. In 2008, leading up to this release, Perry&#x27;s first foray into the dubstep genre was released on 12&quot; vinyl, a collaboration with Dubblestandart and New York City&#x27;s Subatomic Sound System called &quot;Iron Devil&quot;. That record was followed by several more reggae-oriented dubstep collaborations with Dubblestandart and Subatomic Sound System on digital and vinyl, first &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; volumes 1 and 2 (2009), featuring dancehall vocalist Jahdan Blakkamoore, then &quot;Chrome Optimism&quot; (2010), which also featured American filmmaker David Lynch. Following that, in 2010, Perry and Ari Up of the Slits collaborated on a limited-edition Subatomic Sound System 7&quot; called &quot;Hello, Hell Is Very Low&quot;, a rootical dubstep release that would turn out to be one of Ari Up&#x27;s last recordings and the final release during her lifetime.

In 2010, Perry had his first ever solo art exhibition at Dem Passwords art gallery in Los Angeles, California. The show, titled &quot;Secret Education&quot;, featured works on canvas, paper, and a video installation.

In 2011, &quot;The Upsetter&quot;, a documentary film about Perry, narrated by Benicio Del Toro, was released worldwide in theaters after its premiere at the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film was directed and produced by American film makers Ethan Higbee and Adam Bhala Lough, and opened in Los Angeles in March 2011. It continued to screen worldwide into 2012, with the DVD, iTunes, and Video on Demand following soon thereafter.

In 2012, Perry teamed with the Orb to produce &quot;The Orbserver in the Star House&quot;, which was recorded in Berlin over a period of several months. The album earned critical acclaim, and featured the single &quot;Golden Clouds&quot;, named after the historic property located near Perry&#x27;s hometown in Jamaica. The recording sessions were filmed by Volker Schaner and were part of the documentary &quot;Lee Scratch Perry&#x27;s Vision of Paradise&quot;.

In August 2012, it was announced that Perry would receive Jamaica&#x27;s sixth highest honour, the Order of Distinction, Commander class.

In 2013, Perry performed at the first Dub Champions Festival in Vienna, a sold-out performance, backed by Dubblestandart with Adrian Sherwood handling the dub mix. Perry also performed at the first two Dub Champions Festivals in New York City in 2011 and 2012, backed by Subatomic Sound System. Perry performed at the 2013 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.

Perry is featured as the DJ on the dub and reggae radio station &quot;The Blue Ark&quot; in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;. The station includes a number of dubs by Perry and the Upsetters including &quot;Disco Devil&quot; and &quot;Grumblin&#x27; Dub&quot;.

In October 2013, it was announced that Perry will be awarded a Gold Musgrave Medal later that month by the Institute of Jamaica.

Perry recorded an album with Daniel Boyle in London, released in May 2014 as &quot;Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry – Back on the Controls&quot;. The album received a Grammy nomination later that year.

Perry remixed the &quot;Thor&#x27;s Stone&quot; single by UK producer Forest Swords in November 2013.

In 2015, the documentary &quot;Lee Scratch Perry&#x27;s Vision of Paradise&quot; had a worldwide release in cinemas as well as on DVD and VOD after premiering at the East End Film Festival in London. The film followed Perry for 15 years through his home in Switzerland and travels abroad.

In September 2015, Perry and Subatomic Sound System launched a 40th anniversary tour for Perry&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;Super Ape&quot;. The tour began as part of Dub Champions Festival and continued over the next two years with more than 50 dates in North America and some isolated dates in Europe. Nearly every show was sold out on the 2015 and 2016 tours. It culminated with the release of the &quot;Super Ape Returns to Conquer&quot; album in September 2017 which debuted at number 2 on iTunes US reggae chart behind Bob Marley&#x27;s remastered &quot;Legend&quot; album, and on number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; reggae chart. Larry McDonald performed as part of the band and on the recorded album. A Kickstarter campaign was organized in 2015 by Emch of Subatomic Sound System to raise funds to build a custom 15-foot-tall gorilla similar to the one on the original album cover art. The Kickstarter campaign reached its goal and the gorilla appeared on stage during 2015 and 2016 tour dates.

In October 2018, Perry and Subatomic Sound System launched a 45th anniversary tour for the 1973 album &quot;Blackboard Jungle Dub&quot;, produced by Perry. The tour began in North America and tour posters includes the tag line &quot;World&#x27;s 1st dub album, Live for the first time&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published a preview of the tour.

2019 saw the release of &quot;The Revelation of Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry&quot;, a film about the making of his 2010 album &quot;Revelation&quot;, directed by Steve Marshall for State of Emergency. The film features intimate behind the scenes footage of Perry at work in his home studio in the Swiss Alps and an in depth interview with him.

In April 2019, hip hop producer Mr. Green announced that he would be doing a record made out of Perry&#x27;s famous audio stems. In July 2019, Perry announced that the record is entitled &quot;Super Ape vs. 緑: Open Door&quot; and that it would release through Tuff Kong Records on 19 August 2019. The record combined over 20 different genres of music. Hypebeast said it was &quot;Perry&#x27;s best work in years&quot; and that it &quot;pushes boundaries of various genres. The record reached the Top 10 on the iTunes reggae chart and the Top 100 on the Billboard reggae chart.

A couple of weeks prior to his death, Perry released his last song, &quot;No Bloody Friends&quot;. The song was a collaboration with Ral Ston, and it was released on 13 August 2021.

Perry&#x27;s final album was with New Age Doom, titled &quot;Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry&#x27;s Guide to the Universe&quot; (2021). Perry&#x27;s final dub production was for Sly &amp; Robbie vs. Roots Radics, &quot;The Dub Battle&quot; (2021). The song was &quot;The Gates of Dub&quot; with Max Romeo and The Roots Radics band produced by Hernan &quot;Don Camel&quot; Sforzini.

In February 2025 vocals recorded by Perry in 2015-2017 were featured on the album &quot;Mercy&quot; attributed to &#x27;Lee &#x27;Scratch&#x27; Perry, Peter Harris &amp; Fritz Catlin&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Perry resided in Einsiedeln, Switzerland, with his wife Mireille and their two children. He had four other children by the names of Cleopatra Perry, Marsha Perry, Omar Perry, and Marvin (Sean) Perry in various parts of the world. In 2015, his new studio in Switzerland, the &quot;Secret Laboratory&quot;, was damaged by a fire that also destroyed his stage costumes and unreleased recordings.

==Death==
Perry died on 29 August 2021 at the Noel Holmes Hospital in Lucea, Jamaica, from an unspecified illness, aged 85.

<text>&lt;noinclude&gt;

The B-52s, originally presented as the B-52&#x27;s (with an errant apostrophe; used until 2008), are an American new wave band formed in Athens, Georgia, in 1976. The original lineup consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, percussion), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards, synth bass), Cindy Wilson (vocals, percussion), Ricky Wilson (guitar, vocals), and Keith Strickland (drums, guitar, keyboards, vocals). Ricky Wilson died of AIDS-related illness in 1985, and Strickland permanently switched from drums to lead guitar. The band has also added various members for albums and live performances.

The B-52s have had many hits, including &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;, &quot;Planet Claire&quot;, &quot;Party Out of Bounds&quot;, &quot;Private Idaho&quot;, &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot;, &quot;Summer of Love&quot;, &quot;Wig&quot;, &quot;Love Shack&quot;, &quot;Roam&quot;, &quot;Funplex&quot; and &quot;(Meet) The Flintstones&quot;. They have been nominated for three Grammy Awards: twice for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group in 1990 and 1991, and for Best Alternative Music Album in 1992. In April 2022, the group announced they were retiring from touring. A 2023 Las Vegas residency was announced in November 2022.

The group evoked a &quot;thrift shop aesthetic&quot;, in Bernard Gendron&#x27;s words, by drawing from 1950s and 1960s pop music, rock and roll, and camp/kitsch culture. Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson sometimes use call-and-response-style vocals (Schneider&#x27;s often humorous &quot;Sprechgesang&quot; contrasting with Wilson&#x27;s and Pierson&#x27;s melodic harmonies), and their guitar- and keyboard-driven instrumentation is their trademark sound, which was also set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings Ricky Wilson used on their earlier albums.

==History==

===1976–1979: Formation and early years===
They formed as &quot;the B-52&#x27;s&quot; in 1976 when Cindy Wilson, Ricky Wilson (her elder brother), Pierson, Strickland, and cowbell player, poet, and lead vocalist Schneider held an impromptu jam session after sharing a flaming volcano drink at a Chinese restaurant in Athens, Georgia. When they first jammed, Strickland played guitar and Ricky Wilson played congas. They later played their first concert (with Wilson on guitar) in 1977 at a Valentine&#x27;s Day party for their friends.

The name &quot;B-52&#x27;s&quot; comes from a particular beehive hairdo resembling the nose cone of the aircraft, which Pierson and Cindy Wilson wore in performances during the band&#x27;s first decade. Other names the band considered were the Tina-Trons and Fellini&#x27;s Children. Strickland suggested the name after a dream he had of a band performing in a hotel lounge. In the dream, he heard someone whisper in his ear that the band&#x27;s name was &quot;the B-52&#x27;s&quot;.

The band&#x27;s quirky take on the new wave sound of its era was a combination of dance and surf music set apart from their contemporaries by thrift-store chic and the unusual guitar tunings Ricky Wilson used.

The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;, recorded for DB Records in 1978, was an underground success, selling over 2,000 copies, that led to gigs at CBGB and Max&#x27;s Kansas City. Both this version of &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; and its B-side, &quot;52 Girls&quot;, are different recordings from those that appear on the band&#x27;s 1979 debut album, and the early version of &quot;52 Girls&quot; is in a different key.

The re-recorded version of &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; was also released as a single and in the UK and Germany was backed with an instrumental version of &quot;Running Around&quot;, a non-album track at the time. (A vocal re-recording of this appears on the band&#x27;s second album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Wild Planet&quot;.) The buzz the record created in the UK meant their first show in London at the Electric Ballroom was packed and attended by UK pop stars, including Sandie Shaw, Green Gartside from Scritti Politti, and Joe Jackson. In Canada, released on the Warner Bros. label, the single went from cult hit to No. 1 on the &quot;RPM&quot;-compiled national chart on May 24, 1980. John Lennon credited the song with returning him to writing music.

===1979–1982: &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Wild Planet&quot;, and &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;===

In 1979, the B-52s signed contracts as they flew over to Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, to record their debut studio album, with Island founder Chris Blackwell producing. The band was surprised by Blackwell&#x27;s recording methods; he wanted to keep the sound as close as possible to its live sound, so he used almost no overdubs or additional effects.

Released on July 6, 1979, &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; contained re-recorded versions of &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; and &quot;52 Girls&quot;, six originals recorded solely for the album, and a cover of the Petula Clark hit &quot;Downtown&quot;. The album was a major success, especially in Australia, where it reached No. 3 on the charts alongside its three singles: &quot;Planet Claire&quot;, &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;, and &quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot;. In the U.S., the single &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, while the album was certified platinum by the RIAA. In 1980, John Lennon called the B-52s his favorite band and specifically cited &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; as an inspiration for his &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;.

In April 1980, the B-52s returned to Compass Point Studios to record their next album. Several of the songs on the new album had been concert staples since 1978; the band did not record them for their first album, as they had more songs than could fit in a quality LP record. Rhett Davies co-produced the album, which had a more polished production sound than the debut.

Released on August 27, 1980, &quot;Wild Planet&quot; was well received by critics. It reached No. 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1980 and was certified gold; &quot;Private Idaho&quot; became the band&#x27;s second Hot 100 entry. The B-52s performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on January 26, 1980, and at the Heatwave festival (promoted as the &quot;New Wave Woodstock&quot;) in Toronto, Canada, in August 1980. The band also appeared in the Paul Simon film &quot;One Trick Pony&quot;. In July 1981, &quot;Party Mix!&quot; was released, a six-song collection containing songs from the first two albums remixed and sequenced to form two long tracks, one on each side.

In 1981, the band collaborated with Talking Heads&#x27; David Byrne to produce a third full-length studio album. Reportedly due to differences with Byrne over the album&#x27;s musical direction, recording sessions for the album were aborted, prompting the band to release &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; in 1982 as an EP. (In 1991, &quot;Party Mix!&quot; and &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;, the latter of which had been remixed, were combined and released together on a single compact disc.) Also in 1982, the band appeared at the inaugural US Festival, performing on the first day.

===1982–1987: &quot;Whammy!&quot;, &quot;Bouncing off the Satellites&quot;, and death of Ricky Wilson===
In December 1982, the band began recording their third album, &quot;Whammy!&quot;. According to Pierson, Strickland no longer wanted to play the drums, so the band switched to drum machines for this album, with Strickland and Ricky Wilson playing all the music on the album, and the rest of the band providing vocals only. Having originally played guitars, organ, bass guitar and synthesizers, Pierson switched to a mainly vocal role in the studio, but remained behind the keyboards on tour. The band also began experimenting heavily with synthesizers during this period.

Released on April 27, 1983, &quot;Whammy!&quot; reached No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. &quot;Legal Tender&quot; reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play Singles chart alongside &quot;Whammy Kiss&quot; and &quot;Song for a Future Generation&quot;. For the &quot;Whammy!&quot; tour, some tracks featured Strickland on the drums while others used a backing track so Strickland could come forward and play other parts. This also freed up the vocalists (now sometimes not playing instruments) to perform some simple choreography. Copyright issues with Yoko Ono led to the cover song &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot; being removed from the album and replaced by &quot;Moon 83&quot;—a rearranged version of &quot;There&#x27;s a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)&quot; from their debut album—on future pressings of &quot;Whammy!&quot;.

Before the work on the next album the band took a one-year break during which Fred Schneider released his debut solo album &quot;Fred Schneider and the Shake Society&quot;.

In January 1985, the B-52s performed in Brazil at Rock in Rio, for their largest crowd ever. Later in the year, the band struggled to write new material for their next album. The band members all lived together in the same house and felt that collaboration was not working, so they decided to try to write songs separately and began recording in July 1985, again using drum machines and synthesizers extensively. During the recording, guitarist Wilson had been suffering from AIDS, though none of the other band members were aware of his illness except for Strickland, as Wilson &quot;did not want anyone to worry about him or fuss about him.&quot; Wilson died from his illness on October 12, 1985, at the age of 32.

When the band returned to the studio, Strickland had learned how to play the guitar in Wilson&#x27;s style and switched permanently to the new instrument, leaving session players to complete the rhythm section. The results were released on September 8, 1986, as &quot;Bouncing off the Satellites&quot;, a mixture of solo efforts and group efforts. Because of Wilson&#x27;s death, the band did not tour to promote the album. A music video was made for &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot; and the band appeared on some UK television programs but then took a two-year hiatus. Keith Strickland moved to Woodstock, New York, while Pierson and Schneider stayed in New York City. In 1987, the band released a public service announcement in the style of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover on behalf of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.

===1988–1992: Comeback, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, and &quot;Good Stuff&quot;===
Strickland had been composing in 1988. After he played some of his new music for the other band members, they all agreed to try writing together again, with Pierson, Wilson and Schneider contributing the lyrics and melodies. In 1989, the band released &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot;, their mainstream breakthrough, on Reprise Records worldwide. The single &quot;Channel Z&quot; from the new album became an alternative and college radio hit, hitting No. 1 on the U.S. Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, receiving significant airplay on MTV&#x27;s modern rock show &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. They then embarked on the Cosmic Tour.
The next single, &quot;Love Shack&quot;, with its party vibe and colorful music video, became their first top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, ultimately reaching No. 3 in November 1989. That peak was matched in March 1990 when their follow-up single, &quot;Roam&quot;, also reached No. 3. In Australia, the country that had most embraced the band a decade earlier, &quot;Love Shack&quot; remained at No. 1 for eight weeks.

A fourth single, &quot;Deadbeat Club&quot;, which reminisced about the band&#x27;s early days in Athens and whose video was shot on location and featured a cameo by fellow Athens artist R.E.M.&#x27;s Michael Stipe, reached No. 30. &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; climbed into the U.S. top five and earned multi-platinum certification. The album also had international success, reaching No. 1 in both Australia and New Zealand and No. 8 in the UK. The group had a successful world tour to support the record and appeared on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in March 1990. In 1990, the B-52s were nominated for four MTV Video Music Awards, including Video of the Year. They won two awards: Best Group Video and Best Art Direction.

Pierson sang on Iggy Pop&#x27;s song &quot;Candy&quot;, which gave him a top 40 hit. In 1991, Schneider&#x27;s 1984 solo record, &quot;Fred Schneider and the Shake Society&quot;, was repackaged and re-released, resulting in his first Hot 100 single when &quot;Monster&quot; climbed to No. 85. Also that year, Pierson again guest-starred on a popular track, R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;, which reached No. 10 in September. Pierson also appeared on two other songs from R.E.M.&#x27;s chart-topping album &quot;Out of Time&quot;: &quot;Near Wild Heaven&quot; and &quot;Me in Honey&quot;, as well as the outtake &quot;Fretless&quot;.

In late 1990, Cindy Wilson took time off from the band, with Julee Cruise filling in for her on tour. The B-52s released &quot;Good Stuff&quot; in 1992 as a trio—the only album release on which Cindy Wilson was not present—and the title track reached No. 28 that August. The album made it to No. 16 in the U.S. It is also the group&#x27;s most overtly political album, though they had been activists and fundraisers for environmental, AIDS and animal rights causes for many years.

===1993–2007: Soundtrack appearances, 25th anniversary and touring===
The band had their next chart entry in 1994 when, as &quot;the BC-52&#x27;s&quot;, they appeared in &quot;The Flintstones&quot; live-action movie and sang the title song. When released as a single, it reached No. 33 in the U.S. and No. 3 in the UK. In 1994, Pierson and Schneider also sang on the theme song for the Nickelodeon series &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, from the second season onward. In the 1990s, former Duran Duran drummer Sterling Campbell joined the band, but left in 2000 to tour with David Bowie and was replaced that year by Zack Alford, who had recorded and toured with the band during the &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; era. Pierson and Cindy Wilson recorded a cover of the McFadden &amp; Whitehead song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot; for the 1996 film &quot;The Associate&quot;, starring Whoopi Goldberg; Wilson rejoined the B-52s the same year.

A career retrospective, &quot;Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation&quot;, appeared in 1998, along with two remixed maxi-singles: &quot;Summer of Love &#x27;98&quot; and &quot;Hallucinating Pluto&quot;. A major tour (with co-headliners the Pretenders) to promote the collection took place. &quot;Debbie&quot;, another single from the album (a tribute to Blondie&#x27;s Debbie Harry), placed No. 35 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Modern Rock Tracks. In 1999, they recorded a parody of &quot;Love Shack&quot; called &quot;Glove Slap&quot; for an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 2000, they co-headlined another major tour with the Go-Go&#x27;s and recorded the song &quot;The Chosen One&quot; for the movie &quot;Pokémon: The Movie 2000&quot;.

In 2002, a more extensive anthology, &quot;Nude on the Moon: The B-52&#x27;s Anthology&quot;, was released, and in February of that year the band held a series of concerts celebrating their 25th anniversary. The Irving Plaza show in New York City featured Yoko Ono, as well as Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads, as guests, with Chicks on Speed as the opener. Coinciding with the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary was the publication of &quot;The B-52&#x27;s Universe: The Essential Guide to the World&#x27;s Greatest Party Band&quot;, the first and only officially authorized biography of the band. The book was nominated for a Lambda Lit Award and was a Minnesota Book Awards finalist. The B-52s recorded the song &quot;Orange You Glad it&#x27;s Summer&quot; for a Target commercial that aired in spring/summer 2002. Target also used the &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; song &quot;Junebug&quot; in a TV spot five years later. In late 2002, the critically panned cartoon pilot &quot;The Groovenians&quot; featured a theme song performed by the band.

In late 2004, the band opened for Cher on a few dates of her Farewell Tour. In March 2006, they opened for the Rolling Stones at a benefit for the Robin Hood Foundation. They had three remix EPs released by Planet Clique: &quot;Whammy!&quot; in 2005, &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; in 2006, and &quot;Wild Planet&quot; in 2007. During this time span, they appeared on many television shows, including &quot;The L Word&quot;, &quot;V.I.P.&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, as well as numerous times on VH1.

===2008–2021: &quot;Funplex&quot; and continued touring===
Prior to 2008, the band used an apostrophe in their name, rendering it as &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot;. In 2008, the band dropped the apostrophe to become &quot;The B-52s&quot;. Asked about the change, Pierson said &quot;It was not grammatically correct. It&#x27;s not like a possessive. It just seemed superfluous.&quot;

&quot;Funplex&quot;, the band&#x27;s first original album in 16 years (since 1992&#x27;s &quot;Good Stuff&quot;), was released on March 25, 2008, by Astralwerks. Talking about the record&#x27;s sound, Strickland noted, &quot;It&#x27;s loud, sexy rock and roll with the beat turned up to hot pink.&quot; The album was produced by Steve Osborne, who was asked to work on the album based on his work with New Order on the album &quot;Get Ready&quot;.

The album debuted at No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in the U.S., immediately making it the second-highest charting B-52s album ever. The band toured in support of the album and made appearances on talk shows, including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, and performed on &quot;The Today Show&quot; on Memorial Day 2008. They also participated in the True Colors Tour 2008 with Cyndi Lauper and embarked on a European tour in July.

The first single from the album was &quot;Funplex&quot;, which was released digitally on January 29, 2008, to the iTunes Store in the U.S. The second single lifted from the album was &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot;. Schneider said in an interview that the album just broke even and could be the B-52s&#x27; last new studio album, though he later retracted that statement. The B-52s performed their hit track &quot;Love Shack&quot; with Sugarland at the 2009 CMT Music Awards.

On February 18, 2011, the B-52s played a show at the Classic Center in their hometown of Athens, Georgia, four days after the 34th anniversary of their first-ever show on February 14, 1977. The concert was filmed and recorded for &quot;With the Wild Crowd! Live in Athens, GA&quot;, released in October 2011.

The group continued to perform live, with a touring band that featured musicians Sterling Campbell (drums), Paul Gordon (keyboards, guitar) and Tracy Wormworth (bass), and performances included the closing show for the 2011 edition of the Montreal Jazz Festival, as well as being the house band during the 2012 TV Land Awards. At the end of 2012, Strickland announced he would no longer tour with the B-52s, though he would continue as a member of the band. Without Strickland, the B-52s continued to tour across the world with groups including The Go-Go&#x27;s, Tears for Fears, The English Beat, The Psychedelic Furs, Simple Minds, Boy George and Culture Club, and Thompson Twins&#x27; Tom Bailey. Aside from touring, the group covered the &quot;Squidbillies&quot; theme song during Season 10 of the Adult Swim series and appeared as guests in the sketch comedy show &quot;Portlandia&quot;.

In 2019, the group announced a tour to begin in May in the United States, which took them to Europe and back to the U.S. On September 30, 2019, it was reported that the band would be featured in the upcoming Archie Comics&#x27; comic book &quot;Archie Meets the B-52s&quot;, released in February 2020.

===2022–present: Final tour and Vegas residency===
In April 2022, the group announced that they would embark on a final farewell tour, with KC and the Sunshine Band, lasting from August 22 to November 11, 2022. The final dates of the concert were postponed until January 2023, due to illness. The B-52s performed the final concert on their tour at the Classic Center in their hometown of Athens, Georgia on January 10, 2023.

Following the end of the farewell tour, the B-52s embarked on residencies at The Venetian Las Vegas in Paradise, Nevada. The first residency concerts took place in May, August and September 2023, with further dates scheduled for April 2024.

On May 15, 2024, the City of Athens, Georgia, announced that their Federal Prospects Hockey League team would be named the Rock Lobsters, honoring the band and their hit song. The decision came after an online poll where the Rock Lobsters won by a wide margin. The band responded on social media, stating &quot;we are truly honored to have our hometown hockey team named the Rock Lobsters. As the song declares, &#x27;Let’s rock!’&quot;.

<doc id="176906" wikidata="Q1226328" url="?curid=176906" title="Dinesh D'Souza">
<text>Dinesh Joseph D&#x27;Souza (; born April 25, 1961) is an American right-wing political commentator, conspiracy theorist, author, filmmaker, and convicted felon pardoned by Donald Trump. He has made several financially successful films, and written over a dozen books, several of them &quot;New York Times&quot; best-sellers.

Born in Mumbai to Catholic parents, D&#x27;Souza moved to the United States as an exchange student and graduated from Dartmouth College. He was a policy adviser in the administration of President Ronald Reagan and has been affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution. He became a naturalized citizen in 1991. From 2010 to 2012, he was president of The King&#x27;s College, a Christian school in New York City, until he resigned after an alleged adultery scandal.

In 2012, D&#x27;Souza released the conspiracist political film &quot;2016: Obama&#x27;s America&quot;, an anti-Barack Obama polemic based on his 2010 book &quot;The Roots of Obama&#x27;s Rage&quot;. He has since released five other conspiracist films: &quot;&quot; (2014), &quot;Hillary&#x27;s America&quot; (2016), &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; (2018), &quot;Trump Card&quot; (2020) and &quot;2000 Mules&quot; (2022). D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s films and commentary have generated considerable controversy due to their promotion of conspiracy theories and falsehoods, as well as for their incendiary nature.

In 2012, D&#x27;Souza contributed $10,000 to the Senate campaign of Wendy Long on behalf of himself and his wife, agreeing in writing to attribute that contribution as $5,000 from his wife and $5,000 from him. He directed two other people to give Long a total of $20,000 in addition, which he agreed to reimburse, and later did. At the time, the Election Act limited campaign contributions to $5,000 from any individual to any one candidate. Two years later, D&#x27;Souza pleaded guilty in federal court to one felony charge of using a &quot;straw donor&quot; to make the illegal campaign contribution. He was sentenced to eight months incarceration in a halfway house near his home in San Diego, five years&#x27; probation, and a $30,000 fine. In 2018, D&#x27;Souza was issued a pardon by President Donald Trump.

==Early life and career==

Dinesh Joseph D&#x27;Souza was born in Bombay in 1961. D&#x27;Souza grew up in a middle-class family; his parents were Konkani Roman Catholics from the state of Goa in Western India, where his father was an executive with Johnson &amp; Johnson, and his mother was a housewife. D&#x27;Souza attended the Jesuit St. Stanislaus High School in Bombay. He graduated from High school in 1976, and attended Sydenham College in Bombay for year 11 and 12. In 1978, D&#x27;Souza became a foreign exchange student and traveled to the United States under the Rotary Youth Exchange and attended Patagonia Union High School in Patagonia, Arizona. He went on to matriculate at Dartmouth College, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1983 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.

While at Dartmouth, D&#x27;Souza wrote for &quot;The Dartmouth Review&quot;, an independent, student-edited, alumni and Collegiate Network subsidized publication. D&#x27;Souza faced criticism during his time at &quot;The Review&quot; for authoring an article publicly outing homosexual members of the school&#x27;s Gay Straight Alliance student organization. He also oversaw &quot;The Review&quot;&#x27;s publication of &quot;a light-hearted interview&quot; with a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan over a staged photograph of a Black person hanged from a tree; and a piece mocking affirmative action in higher education, written from the point of view of a Black student and phrased in Ebonics. These incidents caused US Representative Jack Kemp, then a prominent Republican leader and member of &quot;The Review&quot;&#x27;s advisory board, to resign from the board.

After graduating from Dartmouth, D&#x27;Souza became editor of a monthly journal called &quot;The Prospect&quot;, a publication financed by a group of Princeton University alumni. The paper and its writers ignited much controversy during D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s editorship by, among other things, criticizing the college&#x27;s affirmative action policies.

From 1985 to 1987, D&#x27;Souza was contributing editor for the &quot;Policy Review&quot;, a journal then published by The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C. In a September 1985 article titled &quot;The Bishops as Pawns,&quot; D&#x27;Souza asserted that Catholic bishops in the United States were being manipulated by American liberals in agreeing to oppose the U.S. military buildup and use of power abroad when, D&#x27;Souza believed, they knew very little about these subjects to which they were lending their religious credibility.

Between 1987 and 1988, D&#x27;Souza was a policy adviser in the administration of President Ronald Reagan. He has been affiliated with the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

In 1991, D&#x27;Souza became a naturalized United States citizen. He renounced Indian citizenship as India&#x27;s nationality law does not recognize dual citizenship.

==Career as author, political commentator, and filmmaker==
===Authorship===
====&quot;The End of Racism&quot;====
In 1995, D&#x27;Souza published &quot;The End of Racism&quot;, in which he claimed that exaggerated claims of racism are holding back progress among African Americans in the United States. He defended the Southern slave owners and said, &quot;The American slave was treated like property, which is to say, pretty well.&quot; D&#x27;Souza also called for a repeal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and argued: &quot;Given the intensity of black rage and its appeal to a wide constituency, whites are right to be nervous. Black rage is a response to black suffering and failure, and reflects the irresistible temptation to attribute African American problems to a history of white racist oppression.&quot;

A reviewer for &quot;The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education&quot; responded to the book by posting a list of 16 recent racist incidents against black people. Michael Bérubé, in a lengthy review article, referred to the book as &quot;encyclopedic pseudoscience&quot;, calling it illogical and saying some of the book&#x27;s policy recommendations are fascist; he stated that it is &quot;so egregious an affront to human decency as to set a new and sorry standard for &#x27;intellectual&#x27;&quot;.

The book was also panned by many other critics: John David Smith, in &quot;The Journal of Southern History&quot;, said D&#x27;Souza claims blacks are inferior and opines that &quot;D&#x27;Souza bases his terribly insensitive, reactionary polemic on sound bite statistical and historical evidence, frequently gleaned out of context and patched together illogically. His book is flawed because he ignores the complex causes and severity of white racism, misrepresents Boas&#x27;s arguments, and undervalues the matrix of ignorance, fear, and long-term economic inequality that he dubs black cultural pathology. How, according to his own logic, can allegedly inferior people uplift themselves without government assistance?&quot; He adds that D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s &quot;biased diatribe trivializes serious pathologies, white and black, and adds little to our understanding of America&#x27;s painful racial dilemma&quot;.

The prepublication version of the book contained a chapter dedicated to those portrayed by D&#x27;Souza as authentic racists, including many paleoconservatives, such as prominent philosopher and &quot;The Washington Times&quot; editor Samuel T. Francis, to whom he attributed several false quotes at the inaugural &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conference. A column by D&#x27;Souza in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; containing this material led to Francis being fired. D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s account of Francis&#x27;s speech was contradicted by video of the event. American Renaissance organizer Jared Taylor took legal action against D&#x27;Souza for several false claims, including that speakers had used racial slurs, resulting in publisher Free Press canceling the initial run and forcing D&#x27;Souza to rewrite portions of the book. Some observers, such as &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; writer Gregory Kane noted that D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s book bore many similarities to Taylor&#x27;s 1992 work &quot;Paved with Good Intentions,&quot; despite D&#x27;Souza accusing Taylor of racism&quot;.&quot; Many right-wing critics, such as Lawrence Auster, believed that D&#x27;Souza was attacking Francis and others to protect himself from accusations of racism.

Paul Finkelman commented on what he called D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s trivialization of racism. In a review article called &quot;The Rise of the New Racism&quot;, Finkelman stated that much of what D&#x27;Souza says is untrue, and much is only partially true, and described the book as being &quot;like a parody of scholarship, where selected &#x27;facts&#x27; are pulled out of any recognizable context, and used to support a particular viewpoint&quot;. In Finkelman&#x27;s opinion, the book exemplifies a &quot;new racism&quot;, which &quot;(1) denies the history of racial oppression in America; (2) rejects biological racism in favor of an attack on black culture; and (3) supports formal, de jure equality in order to attack civil rights laws that prohibit private discrimination and in order to undermine any public policies that might monitor equality and give it substantive meaning&quot;.

The conservative black economist Glenn Loury severed his ties with the American Enterprise Institute over the organization&#x27;s role in the publication of the book. Loury wrote that the book &quot;violated canons of civility and commonality&quot;, with D&#x27;Souza &quot;determined to place poor, urban blacks outside the orbit of American civilization.&quot;

====&quot;What&#x27;s So Great About America&quot;====
In the second chapter of his 2002 book, &quot;What&#x27;s So Great About America&quot;, D&#x27;Souza argues that while colonialism was terrible, it had the unintended consequence of lifting third world countries up to Western civilization. D&#x27;Souza writes, &quot;I realize that in saying these things I am opening the door for my critics, and the incorrigible enemies of the West, to say that I am justifying colonialism ... This is the purest nonsense. What I am doing is pointing out a historical fact: despite the corrupt and self-serving motives of [its] practitioners ... colonialism ... proved to be the mechanism that brought millions of nonwhite people into the orbit of Western freedom.&quot; He holds up the European colonization of India as an example, arguing that in the long run colonization was beneficial for India, because it introduced Western law, universities, infrastructure, and the like, while effectively ending human sacrifice, the practice of &quot;Sati&quot;, and other &quot;charming indigenous customs&quot;.

In a review of the book, economist Thomas Sowell wrote that D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s book exposed the fallacies and hypocrisies of various criticisms of the United States by the Islamic world, &quot;domestic multiculturalist cults,&quot; those who seek reparations for slavery, and the worldwide intelligentsia. According to Sowell: &quot;Perhaps it takes somebody from outside to truly appreciate all the blessings that too many native-born Americans take for granted. D&#x27;Souza understands how rare—sometimes unique—these blessings are.&quot; Sowell also wrote that D&#x27;Souza challenges the notion that all world cultures are equal: &quot;D&#x27;Souza challenges one of the central premises of today&#x27;s intelligentsia: The equality of all cultures. &#x27;If one begins with the multicultural premise that all cultures are equal, then the world as it is makes very little sense,&#x27; he says. Some cultures have completely outperformed others in providing the things that all people seek—health, food, housing, security, and the amenities of life.&quot;

====&quot;The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and its Responsibility for 9/11&quot;====
In early 2007, D&#x27;Souza published &quot;The Enemy at Home: The Cultural Left and its Responsibility for 9/11&quot;, in which he argues that the American cultural left was in large part responsible for the Muslim anger that led to the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon.com/news&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Muslims do not hate America because of its freedom and democracy, but because they perceive America to be imposing its moral depravity (support for sexual licentiousness) on the world. D&#x27;Souza also argues that the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse was a result of &quot;the sexual immodesty of liberal America&quot;, and asserts that the conditions of prisoners at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay &quot;are comparable to the accommodations in mid-level Middle Eastern hotels.&quot;

The book was criticized in major American newspapers and magazines and described as, among other things, &quot;the worst nonfiction book about terrorism published by a major house since 9/11&quot; and &quot;a national disgrace&quot;. Michiko Kakutani in &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;a nasty stewpot of intellectually untenable premises and irresponsible speculation that frequently reads like a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody of the crackpot right.&quot;

D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s book caused controversy in the conservative movement. His conservative critics widely mocked his thesis that the cultural left was responsible for 9/11. In response, D&#x27;Souza posted a 6,500-word essay on &quot;National Review Online&quot;, and &quot;NRO&quot; subsequently published a litany of responses from conservative authors who accused D&#x27;Souza of character assassination, elitism and pseudo-intellectualism.

====&quot;The Roots of Obama&#x27;s Rage&quot;====
The September 2010 book by D&#x27;Souza, &quot;The Roots of Obama&#x27;s Rage&quot; (published in condensed form in a September 2010 &quot;Forbes&quot; op-ed), interprets President Barack Obama&#x27;s past and how it formed his beliefs. D&#x27;Souza states that Obama is &quot;living out his father&#x27;s dream&quot;, so that &quot;[i]ncredibly, the U.S. is being ruled according to the dreams of a Luo tribesman of the 1950s&quot;, who, D&#x27;Souza goes on to describe as a &quot;philandering, inebriated African socialist&quot;. The book appeared on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for four weeks in October–November 2010.

Ryan Chittum, in an article in the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, described the &quot;Forbes&quot; article as &quot;a fact-twisting, error-laden piece of paranoia ... the worst kind of smear journalism—a singularly disgusting work&quot;. Commentators on both the right and left strongly disputed assertions made about Obama in the book and article. The left-leaning Media Matters for America wrote that &quot;&quot;The Roots of Obama&#x27;s Rage&quot; [was] rooted in lies&quot;. Daniel Larison of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; stated: &quot;Dinesh D&#x27;Souza has authored what may possibly be the most ridiculous piece of Obama analysis yet written ... All in all, D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s article reads like a bad conspiracy theory.&quot; Larison criticized D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s suggestion that Obama is anti-business, citing a lack of evidence. Andrew Ferguson of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; wrote, &quot;D&#x27;Souza always sees absence of evidence as evidence of something or other ... There is, indeed, a name for the beliefs that motivate President Obama, but it&#x27;s not anticolonialism; it&#x27;s not even socialism. It&#x27;s liberalism!&quot;. The magazine published D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s letter, in which he expressed surprise &quot;at the petty, vindictive tone of Andrew Ferguson&#x27;s review&quot;.

====&quot;America: Imagine the World Without Her&quot;====
D&#x27;Souza wrote the book &quot;America: Imagine the World Without Her&quot; on which his name is based. When the warehouse club Costco pulled the book from its shelves shortly before the film&#x27;s release, conservative media and fans on social media criticized the move. Costco said it pulled the book due to low sales. D&#x27;Souza disputed the explanation, saying the book had only been out a few weeks and had surged to No. 1 on Amazon.com, while Costco stocked hundreds of much lower-selling books. He and other conservatives asserted it was pulled because one of Costco&#x27;s co-founders, James Sinegal, supported Obama&#x27;s politics. Costco reordered the book and cited the documentary&#x27;s release and related interest for the reorder.

====&quot;The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left&quot;====
In July 2017, D&#x27;Souza published &quot;The Big Lie: Exposing the Nazi Roots of the American Left&quot;. In the book, D&#x27;Souza asserts that the 2016 Democratic Party platform was similar to the platform of the Third Reich. The statement received media attention in 2018 when repeated by Donald Trump Jr. PolitiFact gave the claim its &quot;Pants-on-Fire&quot; rating, noting that &quot;only a small number of elements of the two platforms are clearly similar, and those are so uncontroversial that they appear in the Republican platform as well.&quot; Historians refuted D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s assertion, with University of Maryland historian and Barack Obama critic Jeffrey Herf saying, &quot;There is not the slightest, tiny sliver in which this could be even somewhat accurate.&quot; In another review of the book, historian Nicole Hemmer, then of the University of Virginia&#x27;s Miller Center of Public Affairs, wrote: &quot;For a book about secret Nazis, &quot;The Big Lie&quot; is surprisingly dull ... &quot;The Big Lie&quot; thus adds little to the no-you&#x27;re-the-fascist genre on the right&quot;. &quot;New York Times&quot; columnist Ross Douthat criticized the book, saying it was a &quot;plea-for-attention&quot; by D&#x27;Souza, and that the author had &quot;become a hack&quot;. Douthat further stated, &quot;Because D&#x27;Souza has become a professional deceiver, what he adds are extraordinary elisions, sweeping calumnies and laughable leaps.&quot;

In an article for &quot;The American Conservative,&quot; historian and philosopher Paul Gottfried, who has written extensively on the subject of fascism, harshly criticized a PragerU video hosted by D&#x27;Souza which maintained that fascism was a leftist ideology. D&#x27;Souza also maintained that Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile, who influenced Italian fascism, was a leftist, to which Gottfried noted that this contradicted the research by &quot;almost all scholars of Gentile&#x27;s work, from across the political spectrum, who view him, as I do in my study of fascism, as the most distinguished intellectual of the revolutionary right.&quot;

====Christian apologetics series====

D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s Christian apologetics books, &quot;What&#x27;s So Great About Christianity&quot; and &quot;Life After Death: The Evidence&quot;, were both on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

===Filmmaking===
D&#x27;Souza has written and directed a number of conspiracist political films.

====&quot;2016: Obama&#x27;s America&quot; film (2012)====

D&#x27;Souza wrote and co-directed the documentary-style polemical film &quot;2016: Obama&#x27;s America&quot;. Through interviews and reenactments, the film compares the similarities in the lives of D&#x27;Souza and President Barack Obama. D&#x27;Souza suggested that early influences on Obama affected the decisions he made as president. The film&#x27;s tagline is &quot;Love him or hate him, you don&#x27;t know him.&quot; The film has been criticized on the grounds that what D&#x27;Souza claims to be an investigation of Obama includes considerable projection, speculation, and selective borrowing from Obama&#x27;s autobiography, to prove D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s own narrative. In a &quot;Fact Check&quot; of the film, the Associated Press found that D&#x27;Souza provided little or no evidence for most of his claims, noted that several allegations were factually false, and described the film&#x27;s central thesis as &quot;almost entirely subjective and a logical stretch at best.&quot;

After a limited release beginning July 13, 2012, the film expanded to over 1,000 theaters in late August 2012, and reached more than 2,000 theaters before the end of September 2012, eventually grossing more than $33.4 million. It is the fifth highest-grossing documentary-style film in the United States during the last four decades, and the second highest-grossing political documentary.

The Obama administration described the film as &quot;an insidious attempt to dishonestly smear the president&quot;. Later, when D&#x27;Souza was indicted for violating election law, D&#x27;Souza and his co-producers alleged that he was selectively prosecuted, and that the indictment was politically motivated retribution for the success of the film.

====&quot;America: Imagine the World Without Her&quot; (2014)====

In March 2013, D&#x27;Souza announced work on a documentary-style film titled &quot;&quot; for release in 2014. &quot;America&quot; was marketed to political conservatives and through Christian marketing firms. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; states that D&#x27;Souza is saying that Americans no longer have past heroes like Washington, Lincoln, and Reagan, but &quot;we do have us&quot; in &quot;our struggle for the restoration of America.&quot;

Lions Gate Entertainment released &quot;America&quot; in three theaters on June 27, 2014, and expanded its distribution on the weekend of the U.S. holiday Independence Day on July 4, 2014. CinemaScore reported that the opening-weekend audiences gave the film an &quot;A+&quot; grade. The film grossed , which made it the highest-grossing documentary in the United States in 2014.

The film review website Metacritic surveyed and assessed 10 reviews as negative and 1 as mixed, with none being positive. It gave an aggregate score of 15 out of 100, which indicates &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. The similar website Rotten Tomatoes surveyed and, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 22 as negative and 2 as positive. Of the , it determined an average rating of 2.9 out of 10. The website gave the film an overall score of 8% and said of the consensus, &quot;Passionate but poorly constructed, &quot;America&quot; preaches to the choir.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Paul Bond said the film performed well in its limited theatrical release, &quot;overcoming several negative reviews in the mainstream media&quot;. Bond reported, &quot;Conservatives ... seem thrilled with the movie.&quot;

====&quot;Hillary&#x27;s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party&quot; (2016)====
On July 25, 2016, D&#x27;Souza released the documentary film &quot;Hillary&#x27;s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party&quot;. The film criticizes the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton, the presumptive (and ultimate) Democratic nominee for President of the United States in 2016.

The film was universally panned by professional film critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 4%, based on 27 professional reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. The critics&#x27; consensus on the site reads, &quot;&quot;Hillary&#x27;s America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party&quot; finds Dinesh D&#x27;Souza once again preaching to the right-wing choir—albeit less effectively than ever.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 1 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. It is the lowest-rated film on the website.

Peter Sobczynski wrote, &quot;&quot;Hillary&#x27;s America&quot; may well be the single dumbest documentary that I have ever seen in my life.&quot; A July 2016 review in &quot;Variety&quot; characterized D&#x27;Souza as &quot;a right-wing conspiracy wingnut, the kind of &quot;thinker&quot; who takes off from Barack Obama birther theories and just keeps going, spinning out a web of comic-book liberal evil.&quot; Alex Shephard of &quot;The New Republic&quot; said: 

Some conservatives viewed the film more positively. John Fund of the &quot;National Review&quot; stated that &quot;[the film] is over the top in places and definitely selective, but the troubling facts are accurate and extensively documented in the D&#x27;Souza book that accompanies the movie.&quot; He also called the film &quot;intensely patriotic&quot;. On July 23, 2016, Donald Trump, who was then running as the Republican presidential nominee against Clinton, called on supporters to see the film.

On January 23, 2017, the film was nominated for five Golden Raspberry Awards, Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Dinesh D&#x27;Souza), Worst Actress (Rebekah Turner), Worst Director (Dinesh D&#x27;Souza and Bruce Schooley), and Worst Screenplay. In response to the Razzie nominations, D&#x27;Souza stated that he was &quot;actually quite honored&quot; and called the nominations &quot;petty revenge&quot; in response to Trump&#x27;s election victory, also stating that &quot;the film might have played an important role in the election.&quot; D&#x27;Souza appeared in the video announcing the film as having won four of the five possible Razzies repeating his view that the nominations were awarded in response to Trump&#x27;s election victory.

====&quot;Death of a Nation: Can We Save America a Second Time?&quot; (2018)====

&quot;Death of a Nation&quot; had its world premiere in Los Angeles, California on July 30, 2018. A showing in Washington, D.C., on August 1, 2018, was co-hosted by D&#x27;Souza and President Donald Trump&#x27;s son Donald Trump Jr.

The film &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; centers around drawing parallels between the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. &quot;Death of a Nation&quot; explores the role of the Democratic Party in opposing both presidents. In the film, D&#x27;Souza accuses the Democratic Party—both historically and presently—of racism, white supremacy, and fascism. D&#x27;Souza further argues that the political left attempt to falsely push claims of racism, white supremacy, and fascism onto the political right for political gain. He claims that the modern political left is currently using these types of accusations in attempts to remove Trump from office &quot;by any means necessary.&quot;

The film includes numerous falsehoods and has received criticism from historians regarding aspects of historical accuracy. The film characterizes Adolf Hitler as a liberal; historians characterize Hitler and the Nazis as being far-right. It also claims that Hitler was an LGBTQ sympathizer, whereas the Nazis murdered thousands of gay men and imprisoned homosexuals in concentration camps.

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 1.9/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 1 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. PostTrak reported that filmgoers gave the film a score of 4 out of 5 stars, while &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that those polled by CinemaScore (which was paid by &quot;Death of a Nation&quot;″s filmmakers to conduct polls of audiences) gave it a grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

On its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.3 million on 1,032 screens, the lowest wide release for a D&#x27;Souza film. , the film has grossed .

====&quot;2000 Mules&quot; (2022)====

In May 2022, D&#x27;Souza released &quot;2000 Mules&quot;, a conspiracist political film that falsely alleges Democrat-aligned individuals were paid to illegally collect and deposit ballots into drop boxes in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin during the 2020 presidential election. The film was based on research by True the Vote. Former president Donald Trump praised the film as exposing &quot;great election fraud&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson_5/3/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bump_4/29/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PolitiFact_5/4/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press reported the film was based on faulty assumptions, anonymous accounts and improper analysis of cellphone location data. &quot;The Dispatch&quot;, a conservative online magazine, found that &quot;The film&#x27;s ballot harvesting theory is full of holes&quot;, and mentioned that &quot;D&#x27;Souza has a history of promoting false and misleading claims&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Himmelman_5/21/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2024, AP reported that the publisher of the film, Salem Media Group Inc., had apologized to the man they falsely accused of election fraud in the film and accompanying book, and withdrawn both from their platforms.

====&quot;Police State&quot; (2023)====
Released in October 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported this film &quot;uses falsehoods, misleading interviews and dramatizations to allege federal persecution of Jan. 6 rioters and Christians.&quot; It was screened at Donald Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago residence soon after release.

====&quot;Vindicating Trump&quot; (2024)====

In September 2024, D&#x27;Souza released &quot;Vindicating Trump&quot;, exploring the alleged hurdles facing the former president in his 2024 bid for re-election. The documentary features an interview with Trump by D&#x27;Souza. Trump also promoted the film.

===Media appearances and speaking engagements===
D&#x27;Souza has appeared on numerous national television networks and programs. Six days after the September 11, 2001, attacks, D&#x27;Souza appeared on &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; hosted by Bill Maher. He disputed the assertion that terrorists were cowards by saying, &quot;Look at what they did. You have a whole bunch of guys who were willing to give their life; none of them backed out. All of them slammed themselves into pieces of concrete. These are warriors.&quot; Maher agreed with D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s comments and said, &quot;We have been the cowards. Lobbing cruise missiles from two thousand miles away.&quot;

During an interview on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on January 16, 2007, while promoting his book &quot;The Enemy At Home: The Cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11&quot;, D&#x27;Souza maintained that liberals had some responsibility for the September 11 attacks. He said liberals&#x27; &quot;penchant for interference&quot; had a decided effect in convincing the Carter administration to withdraw support from the Shah, which brought on Muslim fundamentalists&#x27; control of the Iranian government. He also said that the distorted representation of American culture on television is one source of resentment of the United States by Muslims worldwide. D&#x27;Souza believes that traditional Muslims are not too different from traditional Jews and Christians in America. Towards the end of the interview, he admitted that he and Islamic militants share some of the same negative beliefs about liberal Americans.

In late February 2017, students at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, stole more than 200 flyers advertising D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s planned appearance at the university the first week of March. D&#x27;Souza called the protest &quot;pathetic&quot;, and suggested the demonstrators &quot;Come out and debate me. In the best case you may win; in the worst, you&#x27;ll learn something&quot;. Twin brothers Manfred and Jonah Wendt, co-founders of the student conservative group Tigers for Liberty, had passed around 600 notices of D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s visit to campus. Those returned by the protesters contained negative comments about D&#x27;Souza.

==Views==

D&#x27;Souza is generally identified as a neoconservative. He defines conservatism in the American sense as &quot;conserving the principles of the American Revolution.&quot; In &quot;Letters to a Young Conservative&quot;, written as an introduction to conservative ideas for youth, D&#x27;Souza argues that it is a blend of classical liberalism and ancient virtue, in particular, &quot;the belief that there are moral standards in the universe and that living up to them is the best way to have a full and happy life.&quot; He also argues against what he calls the modern liberal belief that &quot;human nature is intrinsically good,&quot; and thus that &quot;the great conflicts in the world ... arise out of terrible misunderstandings that can be corrected through ongoing conversation and through the mediation of the United Nations.&quot;

In the book &quot;Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus&quot; (1991), D&#x27;Souza argued that intolerance of conservative views is common at many universities. He has attributed many modern social problems to what he calls the &quot;cultural left.&quot; In the same book, D&#x27;Souza criticized the affirmative action policies of the University of California, Berkeley.
D&#x27;Souza has also been critical of feminism, and Bruce Goldner, in a review of D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s &quot;Illiberal Education&quot;, noted that he &quot;has a tendency to characterize feminists as castrating misanthropes&quot;.

===Religion===
D&#x27;Souza attended the evangelical church Calvary Chapel from 2000 to about 2010. While stating that his Catholic background is important to him, D&#x27;Souza also says he is comfortable with Protestant Reformation theology and identifies as a nondenominational Christian. A writer of Christian apologetics, D&#x27;Souza has debated against prominent atheists and critics of Christianity on religious and moral issues. His debate opponents have included Dan Barker, Christopher Hitchens, Peter Singer, Daniel Dennett, Michael Shermer, David Silverman, and Bart D. Ehrman.

As a guest contributor for &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;, D&#x27;Souza wrote, &quot;The moral teachings of Jesus provide no support for—indeed they stand as a stern rebuke to—the historical injustices perpetrated in the name of Christianity.&quot; He often speaks out against atheism, nonbelief in spirituality, and secularism. D&#x27;Souza elaborated on his views in the 2007 book he authored, &quot;What&#x27;s so Great about Christianity&quot;. In 2009, he published &quot;Life After Death: The Evidence&quot;, which argues for an afterlife.

D&#x27;Souza has also commented on Islam. He stated in 2007 that &quot;radical Islamic&quot; thinkers have not condemned modernity, science or freedom but only United States&#x27; support of &quot;secular dictators in the region&quot; which deny &quot;Muslims freedom and control over their own destiny&quot;. He has debated Serge Trifkovic and Robert Spencer, who both deem Islam &quot;inherently aggressive, racist, violent, and intolerant.&quot; He has labelled Spencer an &quot;Islamophobe&quot; and &quot;an effective polemicist&quot; in his writings on Islam. D&#x27;Souza has also warned against support for &quot;a $100 million mosque scheduled to be built near the site where terrorists in the name of Islam brought down the World Trade Center&quot; (i.e., the Park 51 Islamic community center and mosque project), and the Middle East becoming a &quot;United States of Islam&quot; in his attacks against President Barack Obama.

D&#x27;Souza has criticized atheism, writing: &quot;The crimes of atheism have generally been perpetrated through a hubristic ideology that sees man, not God, as the creator of values. Using the latest techniques of science and technology, man seeks to displace God and create a secular utopia here on earth&quot;.

===Promotion of conspiracy theories===
D&#x27;Souza has promoted several conspiracy theories, such as the false claim that Obama was not born in the United States and the conspiracy theory that the Clintons had murdered people. D&#x27;Souza has also promoted false claims about businessman and philanthropist George Soros, including that Soros had collaborated with the Nazis as a youth, and that he has sponsored antifa, a left-wing anti-fascist movement. In an August 2016 interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, D&#x27;Souza denied being a conspiracy theorist, stating: &quot;I have never advanced a conspiracy theory in my life.&quot;

In August 2017, D&#x27;Souza suggested that the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally had been staged. In the same month, D&#x27;Souza tweeted that it would be &quot;interesting to see&quot; Soros &quot;extradited to Israel &amp; tried for his complicity in Nazi atrocities against Jews&quot;, and referred to Soros as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s collection boy&quot;.

After mail bombing attempts on prominent Democratic politicians occurred in October 2018, D&#x27;Souza tweeted: &quot;Fake sexual assault victims. Fake refugees. Now fake mail bombs.&quot; D&#x27;Souza argued that the lack of a cancellation mark on the bomb-containing packages was evidence they were not mailed.

===Opinions expressed on Twitter===
In November 2013, D&#x27;Souza received backlash for referring to Obama as &quot;Grown-Up Trayvon&quot; in a tweet. In response to the backlash, D&#x27;Souza posted: &quot;Feigned outrage on the left over me calling Obama &#x27;grown up Trayvon&#x27; except that Obama likened himself to Trayvon!&quot; D&#x27;Souza later deleted the initial post.

In February 2015, D&#x27;Souza wrote: &quot;You can take the boy out of the ghetto&quot; in a post criticizing Obama for using a selfie stick. After the post was criticized as racist, D&#x27;Souza posted: &quot;I know Obama wasn&#x27;t actually raised in a ghetto—I&#x27;m using the term metaphorically, to suggest his unpresidential conduct&quot;.

In January 2017, after civil rights leader and Georgia congressman John Lewis stated that the then-newly elected President Donald Trump was not a &quot;legitimate president&quot;, D&#x27;Souza posted: &quot;The left&#x27;s false narrative inflates minor figures like John Lewis, Democrat, &amp; downplays major ones like Frederick Douglass, Republican&quot;. D&#x27;Souza later posted that civil rights activist Rosa Parks&#x27; contributions to the civil rights movement were &quot;absurdly inflated&quot; and described her as an &quot;overrated Democrat&quot;. D&#x27;Souza received criticism for the posts, with Charles C. W. Cooke of &quot;National Review&quot; stating: &quot;Not only incorrect, it&#x27;s an attitude that would never be struck about a soldier on, say, Veterans Day ... [E]ven if Parks was a minor player (she wasn&#x27;t), she&#x27;d still deserve to be lionized.&quot;

In November 2017, D&#x27;Souza mocked Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, and posted: &quot;I was lukewarm on Roy Moore until the last-minute smear. Now we must elect him to show that the @washingtonpost sleaze attack failed&quot;. David French, then-senior writer at &quot;National Review&quot;, posted &quot;What has happened to you?&quot; in response to D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s post about Nelson.

In February 2018, D&#x27;Souza was criticized for a series of posts which mocked the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. In response to a photo of survivors reacting to Florida lawmakers voting down a proposed ban on assault weapons in the aftermath of the shooting, D&#x27;Souza posted &quot;worst news since their parents told them to get summer jobs&quot;. D&#x27;Souza also accused the survivors of &quot;politically-orchestrated grief&quot; and said that their grief &quot;[struck him] as phony and inauthentic&quot;. D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s comments were condemned by both liberal and conservative commentators. Journalist Jonathan M. Katz wrote: &quot;Let it never be said that Dinesh does not actively root for the death of children.&quot; Others accused D&#x27;Souza of &quot;trolling kids&quot;. D&#x27;Souza was also denounced by the Conservative Political Action Conference, which removed him from its roster of speakers and stated: &quot;his comments are indefensible&quot;. D&#x27;Souza subsequently apologized for the initial tweet, saying that it was &quot;aimed at media manipulation&quot; and that he was being &quot;insensitive to students who lost friends in a terrible tragedy.&quot;

In February 2021, after the January 6 United States Capitol attack took place, D&#x27;Souza suggested that the rioters were little more than &quot;a bunch of rowdy people walking through a hallway&quot;. In May, D&#x27;Souza posted about the attack: &quot;Does this LOOK like an insurrection? A riot? A coup attempt? If it doesn&#x27;t walk like a duck or talk like a duck then it probably isn&#x27;t a duck.&quot;

===FBI===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted D&#x27;Souza as saying on Twitter: &quot;The FBI is the largest criminal gang in the country. It&#x27;s America&#x27;s version of the KGB or the Chinese state police.&quot;

==Presidency of The King&#x27;s College==
In August 2010, D&#x27;Souza was named president of The King&#x27;s College, a Christian liberal arts college then housed in the Empire State Building in Manhattan. In 2012, the college relocated to a larger space next door to the New York Stock Exchange in Lower Manhattan&#x27;s financial district. On October 18, 2012, D&#x27;Souza resigned his post at The King&#x27;s College following a press report that he—despite being married—had shared a hotel room at a Christian conference with another woman and introduced her to others as his fiancée. D&#x27;Souza acknowledged being separated from his wife and having introduced Denise Odie Joseph II as his fiancée at a Christian conference; however, he denied that the two were engaged in an adulterous affair and that he had shared a room with Joseph at the conference, and described the report as &quot;pure libel&quot; that is &quot;worthy of Christian condemnation.&quot; After an investigation by officials at The King&#x27;s College, D&#x27;Souza stated that he had suspended his engagement to Joseph.

After D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s alleged indiscretion became public, the trustees of The King&#x27;s College announced on October 17, 2012, that D&#x27;Souza had resigned his position as president of the university &quot;to attend to his personal and family needs&quot;.

==Campaign finance violation, felony guilty plea, conviction, and pardon==

On January 23, 2014, D&#x27;Souza was charged with making $20,000 in illegal campaign contributions to the New York Senate campaign of Wendy Long and causing false statements to be made to the Federal Election Commission. His attorney responded to the charges by saying his client &quot;did not act with any corrupt or criminal intent whatsoever&quot; and described the incident as &quot;at most ... an act of misguided friendship&quot;.

On May 15, 2014, United States district judge Richard M. Berman rejected the contention that D&#x27;Souza was singled out for prosecution, stating, &quot;The court concludes the defendant has respectfully submitted no evidence he was selectively prosecuted.&quot;

On May 20, 2014, D&#x27;Souza pleaded guilty to one felony count of making illegal contributions in the names of others. On September 23, 2014, the court sentenced D&#x27;Souza to five years&#x27; probation, eight months incarceration in a halfway house (referred to as a &quot;community confinement center&quot;) and a $30,000 fine.

On May 31, 2018, President Donald Trump pardoned D&#x27;Souza.

==Personal life==
D&#x27;Souza dated fellow conservatives Laura Ingraham and Ann Coulter prior to meeting Dixie Brubaker while working at the White House. D&#x27;Souza and Brubaker married in 1992. They have one daughter, Danielle D&#x27;Souza Gill, who is a writer and a member of the Women for Trump Coalition. Danielle D&#x27;Souza married Brandon Gill, the representative for Texas&#x27;s 26th congressional district, in 2017; they have a daughter, Marigold, and live in Flower Mound, Texas.

D&#x27;Souza and Brubaker lived together in California until D&#x27;Souza moved to New York as president of The King&#x27;s College in 2010. He maintained a residence near San Diego, California, where his wife and daughter remained. The couple divorced in 2012.

While D&#x27;Souza was being sentenced for campaign finance fraud in 2014, Brubaker wrote a letter to the judge alleging that D&#x27;Souza had physically abused her; she claimed that &quot;in April 2012 ... he, using his purple belt karate skills, kicked me in the head and shoulder, knocking me to the ground and creating injuries that pain me to this day.&quot;

On March 19, 2016, D&#x27;Souza married Deborah Fancher, a conservative political activist and mother of two. Fancher emigrated from Venezuela at age 10. The wedding was held near San Diego with Rafael Cruz, father of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), officiating.

<text>Radio Birdman is an Australian punk rock band formed by Deniz Tek and Rob Younger in Sydney in 1974. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine described them as &quot;Australia’s first and most influential punk band&quot;.

== History and Origins ==
=== Origins ===
Deniz Tek and Rob Younger formed Radio Birdman in mid-1974 in Sydney, having recently left their bands TV Jones and the Rats, respectively. They recruited classical keyboard player Philip &quot;Pip&quot; Hoyle, drummer Ron Keeley, and bassist Carl Rorke. The band took their name from a mondegreen of “radio burning” in the Stooges&#x27; song &quot;1970&quot;.

In 1975, after facing rejection from various venues and performing in rented garages and community halls, Radio Birdman landed a residency at the Oxford Tavern in Taylor Square, Sydney. They eventually took over the venue&#x27;s management, renaming it The Oxford Funhouse. By this point, Carl Rorke had been replaced by a friend of Rob Younger, former Rats member Warwick Gilbert.

Radio Birdman developed a following within the emerging Sydney punk scene.

After unsuccessfully trying several studios, Radio Birdman found a supportive recording milieu with the help of &quot;Rock Australia&quot; Magazine editor, Anthony O&#x27;Grady. They recorded an EP, &quot;Burn My Eye&quot;, and their first album, &quot;Radios Appear,&quot; produced by John Sayers and Charles Fisher at Trafalgar Studios in Annandale. 

Under Michael McMartin&#x27;s management, Trafalgar Studios signed the band and financed the recordings. &quot;Radios Appear&quot; was critically acclaimed, earning 5 stars in the Australian edition of Rolling Stone. The album owed much of its style to Detroit bands of the late 1960s, such as MC5 and the Stooges, as well as influences ranging from The Doors to The Velvet Underground and instrumental surf music. The title of the album comes from the Blue Öyster Cult song, &quot;Dominance and Submission&quot;, from their 1974 &quot;Secret Treaties&quot; album, which influenced Radio Birdman&#x27;s sound. &quot;Radios Appear&quot; was played on Sydney station 2JJ (Double Jay). Released on the newly-created independent label Trafalgar Records, the album was sold via mail order and was distributed by band members and friends to a few record stores, never achieving widespread sales or commercial success. 

Several years after the initial release and following the breakup of the band, Trafalgar Records licensed the recordings to WEA, who took on the album and gave it a wider release. However, sales remained limited.

When Sire Records president Seymour Stein came to Australia to sign Brisbane punk band the Saints, he saw Radio Birdman and invited them to join his label. Under Sire, licensed by Trafalgar, Radio Birdman released a new version of &quot;Radios Appear&quot; featuring a mixture of re-mixed, re-recorded, and some new material.

The underground scene at the Funhouse, with the growth of the punk movement in Australia, began to attract some dangerous groups, including the Sydney chapter of the Hells Angels. Following a concert at Paddington Town Hall with the Saints and the Hot Spurs in April 1977, Radio Birdman left the Sydney scene altogether, playing sporadically in other cities and working on new material.

The band returned six months later and performed their most successful show to date at Paddington Town Hall on 12 December 1977, with approximately 2,000 attendees. After this show the band moved their base of operations to London and toured in the UK and Europe, both headlining and as support for Sire label-mates the Flamin&#x27; Groovies. 

Their overseas success was short-lived as Sire Records began having financial difficulties and was forced to drop Radio Birdman and many other bands from the label. A planned American tour with the Ramones, scheduled for the second half of 1978, was cancelled. In May 1978, they recorded their second album, &quot;Living Eyes&quot; at Rockfield Studios in Wales. Unreleased by Sire, the tapes eventually were released in 1981, long after the band&#x27;s 1978 breakup.

=== Breakup ===
Without a label, with no tour support and no distribution for &quot;Radios Appear&quot;, the band languished while relationships between its members grew strained. Radio Birdman played one last show at Oxford University in June 1978, after which the band split up.

=== 1978–1996 ===
All six members went on to other bands. Younger joined The Other Side, and later New Christs, bands more oriented towards hard rock. Tek, Keeley, and keyboardist Pip Hoyle formed the Doors-influenced inner-city band the Visitors. Guitarist Chris Masuak and bass guitarist Warwick Gilbert&#x27;s the Hitmen went on to have moderate success in the Australian pub rock scene. Tek, Younger, and Gilbert played in a one-shot touring band called New Race, with Dennis Thompson of the MC5 and Ron Asheton of the Stooges. They made no studio recordings but released one official &quot;live&quot; album, &quot;The First and Last&quot;, and there are two more &quot;bootleg&quot; live albums, &quot;The First to Pay&quot; and &quot;The Second Wave&quot;, on the French label Revenge. 

A non-musical LP, &quot;Soldiers of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, was released in 1982. This album, described by the record company as &quot;an audio documentary of Radio Birdman,&quot; was released after Deniz had quit music to be a jet pilot and was assembled by the people at Trafalgar Records, like a soundtrack for a documentary movie that was never made. 

In 1990, Sheldon Booth (Melbourne Victoria) published Vivien Johnson&#x27;s biography of the band &quot;Radio Birdman&quot; (ISBN 0731678397), described by Deniz Tek as &quot;the most accurate account I&#x27;ve ever seen of what happened in the band&quot; and by Lindsay Hutton of The Next Big Thing as &quot;the nearest thing to a Birdman Bible as we&#x27;re ever likely to be blessed with.&quot;

=== Reunion ===
Radio Birdman reunited for the Big Day Out tour in 1996 and again in 1997. Since then, Radio Birdman has toured sporadically. In 2002, Warwick Gilbert was replaced by Jim Dickson, who had previously played with the New Christs, Louis Tillett, the Passengers, the Barracudas and Deniz Tek. Drummer Ron Keeley left the band in 2004 after the band&#x27;s performance at the Azkena Festival in Spain and was temporarily replaced by Nik Rieth, formerly of the Celibate Rifles, Tumbleweed, the New Christs and the Deniz Tek Group. He was replaced after six shows by You Am I drummer Rusty Hopkinson.

The year 2006 saw much activity by Radio Birdman, spearheaded by the completion of a new album entitled &quot;Zeno Beach&quot;, released in Australia on 24 June 2006 via the band&#x27;s own Crying Sun Records, and in the US via Yep Roc Records on 22 August. &quot;Zeno Beach&quot; was recorded in Sydney in December 2005, produced by guitarist Deniz Tek and engineer Greg Wales. Carl Rorke, the original Radio Birdman bassist, died the year of the new album&#x27;s scheduled release, and it was dedicated to his memory.

Following a February tour of Australian capital cities, the band toured internationally in support of &quot;Zeno Beach&quot; in Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the US, from 27 July 2006 in Sydney to 7 October. This was the first time Radio Birdman played in America. Many Australian dates featured the LA soul/punk band The Bellrays.

In July 2007, the band was inducted into the ARIA (Australian Recording Industry Association) Hall of Fame (in an interview, vocalist Rob Younger indicated the band had previously declined an invitation to join the Hall of Fame years before). The induction saw all living original members plus current members attend the ceremony, except for Pip Hoyle.

Daniel Johns of Silverchair gave the induction speech, followed by the band playing a short set of two songs. The three guitarists (Tek, Masuak, and Dickson) also participated in what appeared to be an uncharacteristically rehearsed stage move, each holding up their guitars and saluting the drums during the song New Race. Murray Shepherd (ex-the Screaming Tribesmen and current the Hitmen drummer) sat in on drums for this occasion, as then-drummer Russell Hopkinson was touring with You Am I.

The band again toured Australia, the US, Canada, and Europe, with approximately 80 concerts in 2007. In September 2007, the band featured in the &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; tour alongside the Stems and Hoodoo Gurus which launched in Sydney at the Enmore Theatre and included dates across Australia. In October 2007, Radio Birdman ceased touring after a long run of dates in Europe, ending in Athens, Greece.

In 2014, the band released a box set on the Citadel label. The box set included 7 CDs and 1 DVD, featuring remasters of the band&#x27;s official releases plus archived and previously unheard studio material. The box also contains a professional recording of the 12 December 1977 Paddington Town Hall concert. In November 2014, the band was reassembled to promote the release of the Box Set, and played shows across Australia. The 2014 lineup featured Nik Rieth on drums and Dave Kettley on guitar (replacing longtime member Chris Masuak), along with Jim Dickson (bass) and original founding members Rob Younger, Pip Hoyle, and Deniz Tek. Radio Birdman completed European and Australian tours in 2015 and 2016.

In June and July 2017, the band undertook a joint national tour with Died Pretty. They last performed live in 2019.

In 2017, Radio Birdman was the subject of a feature-length documentary, &quot;Descent into the Maelstrom – The Radio Birdman Story&quot;. The film covered the band&#x27;s history, from precursor bands The Rats and TV Jones to their European tour in 2015. In December 2020, Radio Birdman were listed at number 44 in &quot;Rolling Stone Australia&quot;″s &quot;50 Greatest Australian Artists of All Time&quot; issue.

A commemorative tour of Australia in 2024 celebrated 50 years of Radio Birdman, culminating in a Sydney concert. A biography &quot;Retaliate First: How one band smashed the rules of Australian rock and roll&quot; was released in July 2024 coinciding with this final tour.

==Crying Sun records==

Crying Sun Records is the record company privately owned by Radio Birdman. Only a few albums have been released by this label including Radio Birdman&#x27;s 1996 live album, &quot;Ritualism&quot; and their 2006 reunion album, &quot;Zeno Beach&quot;.

The label is named after the song &quot;Crying Sun&quot; by Radio Birdman on their 1981 studio album, &quot;Living Eyes&quot;. Crying Sun Records were originally based around Radio Birdman owned music venue turned bar, The Oxford Funhouse. Crying Sun Records was created by the band in association with Citadel Records to handle all the band&#x27;s current and future recorded work. It was created to ensure that the band would be completely independent of record industry support or influence. This was seen as essential to maintaining the band&#x27;s commitment to quality and fairness for the people who choose to listen.

The Crying Sun Records logo was designed by Radio Birdman bass player, Warwick Gilbert.

The documentary features live footage of the band and interviews with its various members and fans. The DVD was an official selection of the Detroit Freep Film Festival 2018, the Glasgow Film Festival 2018, the London Screensound Festival 2018, and the Manifesto Festival Amsterdam 2018. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;brutally honest&#x27;, and I-94 Bar called it &quot;the best rock documentary ever made&quot;.

<text>The Saints were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane, Queensland in 1973. Founded by singer-songwriter Chris Bailey, drummer Ivor Hay, and guitarist-songwriter Ed Kuepper, they originally employed fast tempos, raucous vocals and a &quot;buzzsaw&quot; guitar sound that helped initiate punk rock in Australia and identified them with the greater international movement.

Unable to get gigs, they converted their share house into a venue where they could play. With their debut single &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot;, released in September 1976, they became the first punk band outside the US to release a record, ahead of the first UK punk releases from the Damned, the Sex Pistols and the Clash. They experienced UK chart success in 1977 with the song &quot;This Perfect Day&quot;, which peaked at #34. Bassist Kym Bradshaw left in 1977 to join first-wave British punk rock band, The Lurkers, and was replaced by Algy Ward. Their second album &quot;Eternally Yours&quot;, released in 1978, saw the band pursue a bigger and more R&amp;B driven sound, augmented by a horn section. 

After their third album &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot; later in 1978, Kuepper clashed with Bailey over the band&#x27;s musical direction and left, subsequently forming the post-punk group Laughing Clowns, while Hay and Ward followed suit. Bailey, the sole mainstay of the group, continued under the Saints moniker with a rotating lineup of musicians in the ensuing decades. 1986&#x27;s &quot;All Fools Day&quot; peaked in the Top 30 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart in April 1986 and yielded the hit song &quot;Just Like Fire Would&quot;. Bailey also forged a solo career, and had relocated to Sweden by 1994. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2001. Bailey died in April 2022.

==History==
===1973–1976: Formative years===
The Saints&#x27; original members were Brisbane schoolmates Bailey, Kuepper and Hay. They had formed Kid Galahad and the Eternals in 1973 with Irish-raised Bailey on vocals, Brisbane-born Hay on piano and German-born Kuepper on guitar. Their musical inspirations came from 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll musicians such as Little Richard and Elvis Presley (their name referenced his 1962 film, &quot;Kid Galahad&quot;) and 1960s proto-punk bands like the Missing Links, the Stooges and MC5. They rehearsed in a shed at the back of Hay&#x27;s place, which was opposite the local police headquarters. 

The band renamed themselves the Saints in 1974, inspired by Leslie Charteris&#x27;s character The Saint. They played covers of Del Shannon, Connie Francis and Ike and Tina Turner – &quot;exploding them almost beyond recognition with energy&quot;. Jeffrey Wegener joined on drums and Hay switched to bass guitar. Wegener had left by 1975, Hay moved to drums and Kym Bradshaw joined on bass guitar. Contemporaneous with Ramones, the group were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and &quot;buzz saw&quot; guitar that characterised early punk rock. Kuepper explained that they played faster and faster as they were nervous in front of audiences. The police would often break up their gigs, and arrests were frequent. Unable to obtain bookings, Bailey and Hay converted the Petrie Terrace house they shared into the 76 Club so they had a venue to play in. According to Australian rock historian, Ian McFarlane, they had developed their &quot;own distinctive sound as defined by Kuepper&#x27;s frenetic, whirlwind guitar style and Bailey&#x27;s arrogant snarl&quot;.

===1976–1977: &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot;===
In June 1976, the Saints recorded two self-produced tracks, &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; and &quot;No Time&quot; with Mark Moffatt engineering (label credits for both sides say &#x27;Produced by The Saints&#x27;). Unable to find any interested label, they formed Fatal Records and independently released their debut single in September. Their self-owned Eternal Promotions sent discs to radio stations and magazines both in Australia – with little local interest – and United Kingdom. In the UK, a small label, Power Exchange, issued the single. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewer, Jonh Ingham, declared it, &quot;Single of this and every week&quot;. EMI head office in London contacted the Sydney branch and directed that they be signed to a three-album contract. Over two days in December, the group recorded their first LP, &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; (February 1977), with Rod Coe producing. It included a cover version of the Missing Links&#x27; track &quot;Wild About You&quot;. They supported AC/DC in late December 1976 and, early in 1977, relocated to Sydney. EMI re-issued the single, &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; in February and it reached the Kent Music Report Top 100 Singles Chart.

The Saints resisted being re-modelled into the English punk look and were generally ignored by the Australian press. Mainstream public was warned that punk rock is &quot;a sinister new teenage pop cult, based on sex, sadism and violence, [which] is sweeping Britain.&quot; In May 1977, the band released their second single, &quot;Erotic Neurotic&quot; and then moved to the UK, where they differed with their label over how they should be marketed. EMI planned to promote them as a typical punk band, complete with ripped clothes and spiky hair – the Saints insisted on maintaining a more downbeat image. In June, bass guitarist Alasdair &quot;Algy&quot; Ward replaced Bradshaw. Their next single &quot;This Perfect Day&quot; (July) peaked at No. 34 in the UK but further improvement was frustrated by EMI&#x27;s failure to press enough copies to satisfy demand.

===1978–1979: &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; and &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot;===
The Saints released their second album, &quot;Eternally Yours&quot;, in May 1978 on EMI/Harvest with Bailey and Kuepper producing. The album showed the band moving towards a more R&amp;B style of rock, including a brass section on songs like &quot;Know Your Product&quot; which had been released as a single in February. Another track, &quot;Private Affair&quot;, focussed on what the band members saw as the pigeon-holing, hype and commercialisation of punk. The album reached the Top 100 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart.

The jazz-blues influenced third album, &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot;, followed in October 1978 (January 1979 in Australia). Its commercial failure led EMI to drop the band. During 1978, relations between Kuepper and Bailey had deteriorated, with Bailey preferring rock and pop songs and Kuepper pursuing less commercial and more intellectual material. Finally Hay, Kuepper and Ward left the group in early 1979. Kuepper returned to Australia and followed a more avant-garde direction with Laughing Clowns, which would frequently feature brass, and later, the punkish the Aints. He is one of Australia&#x27;s most influential and highly regarded musicians with over twenty solo albums to his credit. Hay briefly returned to Australia to join Sydney-based the Hitmen and then rejoined Bailey in London for a later version of the Saints. Ward became a member of English gothic punk band, the Damned. Bailey continued the group with Mark Birmingham on drums, Bruce Callaway on guitar, Barry Francis on guitar and Janine Hall on bass guitar.

===1980s: &quot;Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow&quot; to &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;===
The Saints&#x27; first release after Kuepper&#x27;s departure was the EP, &quot;Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow&quot;, in March 1980 on Lost Records with Bailey producing. It was followed by a studio album, &quot;The Monkey Puzzle&quot;, co-produced by Bailey and Gerry Nixon for Mushroom Records in February 1981. It reached the Top 100 on the Australian Albums Chart. They had shifted to a more melodic pop-rock sound and included Hay on keyboards in the line-up. Hay left again before the next album was released in Australia in 1982 as &quot;I Thought This Was Love, But This Ain&#x27;t Casablanca&quot; on Mushroom Records and elsewhere as &quot;Out in the Jungle... Where Things Ain&#x27;t So Pleasant&quot; on New Rose Records. Production was credited to Ricardo Mentalban, and with Bailey, in the Saints, were Hall on bass guitar and Iain Shedden (ex-Jolt) on drums. Additional musicians included Roger Crankwell on saxophone and clarinet, Denis Haines on piano, Paul Neiman on trombone, Steve Sidwell on trumpet and Jess Sutcliffe on piano. The Damned&#x27;s Brian James guested on lead guitar.

In late 1982, the group toured Australia with Bailey, Hall and Shedden joined by Chris Burnham on guitar (ex-Supernaut) and Laurie Cuffe on guitar. In 1983, Bailey released his first solo album, &quot;Casablanca&quot;, on New Rose. In 1984, Bailey was based in Sydney, and the Saints&#x27; album, &quot;A Little Madness to Be Free&quot;, was released in July on RCA with production credited to Lurax Debris (Bailey&#x27;s pseudonym). It contains the popular track &quot;Ghost Ships&quot;, which was issued as a single in May. &quot;A Little Madness to Be Free&quot; was &quot;more rock-oriented, with extensive use of acoustic guitar, brass and strings set among tightly focused arrangements&quot;. In mid-1984, the band toured as Bailey, Burnham, Shedden and Tracy Pew on bass guitar, (ex-Birthday Party), who was briefly replaced by Kuepper in July. By 1985, the Saints were Bailey, Richard Burgman on guitar (ex-Sunnyboys) and Arturo &#x27;Archie&#x27; Larizza on bass guitar (the Innocents), while Louise Elliot on saxophone and Jeffrey Wegener on drums (both ex-Laughing Clowns) completed the line-up. A live album, &quot;Live in a Mud Hut ... Somewhere in Europe&quot;, recorded in 1984 with production credited to Mugumbo, was released by New Rose in 1985.

Hay returned and, with Bailey, Burgman and Larizza, the group recorded &quot;All Fools Day&quot; in Wales with Hugh Jones producing. It was issued by Mushroom Records in Australia and Polydor in United States, in April 1986. The album reached the Top 30 in Australia and included a Top 30 single, &quot;Just Like Fire Would&quot; (March). The group joined the Australian Made Tour in December 1986 – January 1987 with other local acts Mental as Anything, I&#x27;m Talking, the Triffids, Divinyls, Models, Jimmy Barnes and INXS.

&quot;Prodigal Son&quot; followed in April 1988, which reached the Top 50. The line-up was Bailey, Francis, Larizza, Shedden and Joe Chiofalo on organ. It was produced by Bailey, Brian McGee and Vanda &amp; Young. The single, &quot;Grain of Sand&quot;, from &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; peaked at No. 11 on the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. In March 1989, the Saints had an Australian Top 40 hit with a cover of the Easybeats&#x27; song &quot;Music Goes &#x27;Round My Head&quot;, which also featured in the 1988 film &quot;Young Einstein&quot;″s soundtrack. Their version of &quot;The Music Goes Round My Head&quot; reached No. 19 on the US Alternative Songs chart.

===1990–present: Later years, reunions, spinoffs and deaths===
The Saints issued a compilation album, &quot;Songs of Salvation and Sin 1976–1988&quot; in 1990 on Raven Records with liner notes penned by Glenn A. Baker. Over the years, Kuepper had grown unhappy with Bailey&#x27;s ongoing use of the Saints name and, in particular, with Baker crediting Bailey for the band&#x27;s original creative direction. In April 1991, Kuepper formed the Aints, which performed versions of vintage the Saints&#x27; material. The Saints issued &quot;Permanent Revolution&quot; in 1991 on Mushroom Records, and while Bailey released solo albums, the group went into hiatus.

By 1994, Bailey had moved to Sweden where he recorded a solo album, &quot;54 days at sea&quot;, and in 1996 issued the Saints&#x27; album, &quot;Howling&quot;, which was produced by the band for Blue Rose Records. Bailey provided vocals, guitars and organ, and was joined by Andreas Jornvill on drums, Joakim Täck on bass guitar, Ian Walsh on guitar and Mons Wieslander on guitar. The group toured Australia in February 1997 – their first tour there in eight years. &quot;Everybody Knows the Monkey&quot; followed in May 1998 on Last Call Records with Bailey were Michael Bayliss on bass guitar, Martin Bjerregaard on drums and Andy Faulkner on guitar – it was produced by Bailey and Martin Hennel.

Mushroom Records celebrated their 25th anniversary with the Mushroom 25 Live concert in November 1998; Bailey performed &quot;Ghost Ships&quot; and &quot;Just Like Fire Would&quot;, and a duet with Paul Kelly on &quot;Wide Open Road&quot;, as a tribute to David McComb of the Triffids.

&quot;Spit the Blues Out&quot; was issued in 2000 in France by Last Call Records with production credited to Debris. It displayed &quot;&#x27;60s-era blues-rock&quot; and &quot;Brit-pop&quot; influences, with Patrick Mathé of French label New Rose providing harmonica and guitar.

On 11 September 2001, the original line-up of the Saints came together for a one-off reunion when the writer Clinton Walker, a long-time friend and champion of the band, inducted them into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame.

By 2005, the group had re-located to Amsterdam, Netherlands - with Bailey were the line-up of Marty Willson-Piper on guitar, Caspar Wijnberg on bass guitar and Pete Wilkinson on drums. They issued &quot;Nothing Is Straight in My House&quot; in 2005, and after Willson-Piper left they released &quot;Imperious Delirium&quot; in 2006. They undertook a European tour to promote it and continued to tour America through late 2007.

On 14 July 2007, Bailey, Kuepper and Hay re-united for another one-off gig at the Queensland Music Festival, with current member Wijnberg on bass guitar. In January 2009, as part of the All Tomorrows Parties touring festival, in this instance curated by Mick Harvey formerly of The Birthday Party, the Saints with Bailey, Hay, Kuepper and Larizza played shows in Brisbane, Sydney and in Mount Buller, Victoria. This was followed by a Melbourne show on 14 January as part of the Don&#x27;t Look Back sideshow concerts, where they performed the &quot;I&#x27;m Stranded&quot; album in its entirety. In 2010 the band returned to a three piece with Wilkinson returning as drummer and to the line-up, and the addition of new bassist Jane Mack. In May 2010, Kuepper and Bailey reunited for a month-long tri-residency series of shows in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. With Kuepper on electric guitar/vocals and Bailey on acoustic guitar/bass guitar/vocals, they played a selection of songs from early Saints, both solo careers, and post-Kuepper Saints, as well as a few covers.

2012 saw the recording of &quot;King of the Sun&quot;. The album was recorded at the Trackdown studios in Sydney, where Bailey had previously recorded &quot;Savage Entertainment&quot;. Released in Australia in late 2012, &quot;King of the Sun&quot; was delayed in European countries until April 2013.

On 7 November 2013, the Saints appeared as a 4-piece at the Borderline club in London, England. Alongside Bailey were stalwart Saints Barrington Francis and Peter Wilkinson. The band was augmented with Chris Dunne on keyboards.

In 2017, a mural dedicated to the Saints and their song &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; was enacted on Roma Street, Brisbane. The mural included lyrics from the song and is situated close to 4 Petrie Terrace, the location previously used by the band as an unlicensed venue.

In 2021, the State Library of Queensland named its copy of &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; as one of the treasures from its John Oxley Library collection, citing the 7” vinyl single represented a piece of Australian and Queensland music history, influencing generations of bands around the world.

Chris Bailey died on April 9, 2022, aged 65. 

In mid-2024, a remastered box set edition of The Saints&#x27; first album was announced, with Kuepper and Hay forming a new spinoff, The Saints 73–78, to tour the 50th anniversary of &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot;. The band also featured Mick Harvey of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds on keyboards and guitar, Peter Oxley of Sunnyboys on bass and Mark Arm from Mudhoney on vocals. 

==Influence==
The Saints were one of the first and most influential punk rock groups. According to Bob Geldof, &quot;Rock music in the seventies was changed by three bands—the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and the Saints&quot;.

In May 2001, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary and named &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; in its Top 30 Australian songs of all time. The band was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in September. In 2007, &quot;I&#x27;m Stranded&quot; was one of the first 20 songs stored on the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia registry. Their début album, &quot;(I&#x27;m) Stranded&quot; was listed at No. 20 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;, in October 2010. Their third album, &quot;Prehistoric Sounds&quot;, also appeared in the list, at No. 41.

In a tribute published on his Red Hand Files Q&amp;A platform, Nick Cave remembered Bailey as “perhaps the greatest and most anarchic rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll singer Australia would ever produce”.

<text>Anderson Meade &quot;Lux&quot; Lewis (September 4, 1905 – June 7, 1964) was an American pianist and composer, remembered for his playing in the boogie-woogie style. His best-known work, &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues&quot;, has been recorded by many artists.

==Biography==
Lewis was born in Chicago, though some sources state Louisville, Kentucky, on September 4, 1905 (September 3 and 13 have also been cited as his date of birth in sources). In his youth he was influenced by the pianist Jimmy Yancey.

His father, a guitarist who made two recordings of his own, introduced Meade to music and arranged for him to have violin lessons. He gave up the violin at age 16, shortly after his father&#x27;s death, and switched to the piano. The nickname &quot;Lux&quot; was given to him by his boyhood friends. He would imitate a couple of characters from a popular comic strip in Chicago, &quot;Alphonse and Gaston&quot;, and stroke an imaginary beard as part of the routine. His friends started calling him the Duke of Luxembourg because of this, and the name stuck for the rest of his life. He became friends with Albert Ammons during childhood, a friendship that would last throughout their lives. They went to the same school together briefly, and they practiced and learned the piano together on the Ammons family piano.

A 1927 rendition of &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues”, released by Paramount Records, marked his recording debut. He remade it for Parlophone in 1935 and for Victor in 1937, and a recording exists of a radio show, &quot;Camel Caravan&quot;, broadcast from New York City in 1939, which includes &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues”. His performance at John Hammond&#x27;s historic &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall in 1938 brought Lewis to public attention. Following the event, Lewis and two other performers from that concert, Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson, often appeared as a trio and became the leading boogie-woogie pianists of the day.

They had an extended engagement at Café Society, toured as a trio, and inspired the formation of Blue Note Records in 1939. Their success led to a decade-long boogie-woogie craze, with big-band swing treatments by Tommy Dorsey, Will Bradley, and others; and numerous country boogie and early rock-and-roll songs.

Lewis appeared in the movies &quot;New Orleans&quot; (1947) and &quot;Nightmare&quot; (1956). He also appeared, uncredited, in the movie &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; (1946), playing piano in the scene where George Bailey gets thrown out of Nick&#x27;s Bar.

Lewis was fond of the Minneapolis area, where a niece lived, and would visit as often as he could. He appeared annually at the White House Restaurant (no longer extant) in Golden Valley. He began a successful three-week engagement there in May 1964. Around 2 a.m. on Sunday, June 7, Lewis left the parking lot of the White House and headed east on Olson Memorial Highway, when his Chrysler Imperial was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Ronald Bates, who was traveling an estimated 80 mph. Lewis&#x27;s car was pushed 400 feet and crashed into a tree; he was killed instantly. He was 58. Bates survived, but his passenger died the following day.

==Legacy==
Lewis&#x27; best-known work, &quot;Honky Tonk Train Blues”, has been recorded in various contexts, often in a big band arrangement. Early recordings of the piece by artists other than Lewis include performances by Adrian Rollini, Frankie Trumbauer, classical harpsichordist Sylvia Marlowe, theater organist George Wright (with drummer Cozy Cole, under the title &quot;Organ Boogie&quot;), and Bob Zurke with Bob Crosby&#x27;s orchestra. Keith Emerson of Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer often included it in his repertoire and had a Top 30 hit with it in 1976 on a single, and then they included that title in their 1977 album Works Volume II.

Lewis was mentioned in Chapter 81 of author Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. Lewis is also mentioned in Ross Macdonald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Moving Target&quot; and in Keith Richards&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Life&quot;.

<text>Henry Eyring (February 20, 1901 – December 26, 1981) was a Mexico-born United States theoretical chemist whose primary contribution was in the study of chemical reaction rates and intermediates.
Eyring developed the Absolute Rate Theory or Transition state theory of chemical reactions, connecting the fields of chemistry and physics through atomic theory, quantum theory, and statistical mechanics.

==History==
Eyring, a third-generation member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), was reared on a cattle ranch in Colonia Juárez, Chihuahua, a Mormon colony, for the first 11 years of his life. His father, Edward Christian Eyring, practiced plural marriage; Edward married Caroline Romney (1893) and her sister Emma Romney (1903), both daughters of Miles Park Romney, the great-grandfather of Mitt Romney. 

In July 1912, the Eyrings and about 4,200 other immigrants were driven out of Mexico by violent insurgents during the Mexican Revolution and moved to El Paso, Texas. After living in El Paso for approximately one year, the Eyrings relocated to Pima, Arizona, where he completed high school and showed a special aptitude for mathematics and science. He also studied at Gila Academy in Thatcher, Arizona, now Eastern Arizona College. One of the pillars at the front of the main building still bears his name, along with that of his sister Camilla&#x27;s husband, Spencer W. Kimball, later president of the LDS Church.

Eyring earned a BS in mining engineering at the University of Arizona by working in a copper mine. He then received a fellowship from the US Bureau of Mines fellowship and earned his M.Sc. in metallurgy. Having seen the high rates of accidents in the mines, and breathed sulfur fumes from blast furnaces at a smelter, he chose to do his Ph.D. in chemistry. He pursued and received his doctoral degree in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1927 for a thesis on &quot;A Comparison of the Ionization by, and Stopping Power for, Alpha Particles of Elements and Compounds.&quot;

Princeton University recruited Eyring as an instructor in 1931. He would continue his work at Princeton until 1946. In 1946 he was offered a position as dean of the graduate school at the University of Utah, with professorships in chemistry and metallurgy. The chemistry building on the University of Utah campus is now named in his honor.

A prolific writer, Eyring authored more than 600 scientific articles, ten scientific books, and a few books on the subject of science and religion. He received the Wolf Prize in Chemistry in 1980 and the National Medal of Science in 1966 for developing the Absolute Rate Theory or Transition state theory of chemical reactions, one of the most important developments of 20th-century chemistry.

Several other chemists later received the Nobel Prize for work based on the Absolute Rate Theory, and his failure to receive the Nobel was a matter of surprise to many. The Nobel Prize organization admitted that &quot;Strangely, Eyring never received a Nobel Prize&quot;; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences apparently did not understand Eyring&#x27;s theory until it was too late to award him the Nobel. The academy awarded him the Berzelius Medal in 1977 as partial compensation. Sterling M. McMurrin believed Eyring should have received the Nobel Prize but was not awarded it because of his religion.

Eyring was elected president of the American Chemical Society in 1963 and the Association for the Advancement of Science in 1965.

== Personal life ==
Eyring married Mildred Bennion. She was a native of Granger, Utah, who had a degree from the University of Utah and served as head of the physical education department there. She met Eyring while pursuing a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin. They had three sons together. The oldest, Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Eyring was an emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of Utah. The second son, Henry B. Eyring is a general authority of the LDS Church, while the youngest son Harden B. Eyring is a higher education administrator for the State of Utah. His wife, Mildred, died June 25, 1969, in Salt Lake City, Utah. On August 13, 1971, he married Winifred Brennan in the LDS Church&#x27;s Salt Lake Temple.

Eyring was a member of the LDS Church throughout his life. His views of science and religion were captured in this quote: &quot;Is there any conflict between science and religion? There is no conflict in the mind of God, but often there is conflict in the minds of men.&quot; Eyring also feared overeager defenders of faith would discard new scientific findings because of apparent contradictions. He encouraged parents and teachers to distinguish between &quot;what they know to be true and what they think may be true,&quot; to avoid clumping them together and &quot;throwing the baby out with the bath.&quot;

As a member of the LDS Church, Eyring served as a branch president, district president, and, for over twenty years, a member of the general board of the Deseret Sunday School Union. As of 2024, his son, Henry B. Eyring, is an apostle and member of the church&#x27;s First Presidency.

<doc id="176917" wikidata="Q355892" url="?curid=176917" title="Mikhail Ostrogradsky">
<text>Mikhail Vasilyevich Ostrogradsky (; 24 September 1801 – 1 January 1862), also known as Mykhailo Vasyliovych Ostrohradskyi (), was a Russian Imperial mathematician, mechanician, and physicist of Zaporozhian Cossacks ancestry. Ostrogradsky was a student of Timofei Osipovsky and is considered to be a disciple of Leonhard Euler, who was known as one of the leading mathematicians of Imperial Russia.

== Life ==
Ostrogradsky was born on 24 September 1801 in the village of Pashennaya (at the time in the Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire, today in Kremenchuk Raion, Poltava Oblast, Ukraine). From 1816 to 1820, he studied under Timofei Osipovsky (1765–1832) and graduated from the Imperial University of Kharkov. When Osipovsky was suspended on religious grounds in 1820, Ostrogradsky refused to be examined and he never received his Ph.D. degree. From 1822 to 1826, he studied at the Sorbonne and at the Collège de France in Paris, France. In 1828, he returned to the Russian Empire and settled in Saint Petersburg, where he was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences. He also became a professor of the main military engineering school of the Russian Empire.

Ostrogradsky died in Poltava in 1862, aged 60. The Kremenchuk Mykhailo Ostrohradskyi National University in Kremenchuk, Poltava oblast, as well as &quot;Ostrogradsky street&quot; in Poltava, are named after him.

== Work ==


He worked mainly in the mathematical fields of calculus of variations, integration of algebraic functions, number theory, algebra, geometry, probability theory and in the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical physics and classical mechanics. In the latter, his key contributions are in the motion of an elastic body and the development of methods for integration of the equations of dynamics and fluid power, following up on the works of Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Siméon Denis Poisson and Augustin Louis Cauchy.

In Russia, his work in these fields was continued by Nikolay Dmitrievich Brashman (1796–1866), August Yulevich Davidov (1823–1885) and especially by Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky (1847–1921).

Ostrogradsky did not appreciate the work on non-Euclidean geometry of Nikolai Lobachevsky from 1823, and he rejected it, when it was submitted for publication in the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.

Ostrogradsky was a teacher of the children of Emperor Nicholas I.

===Divergence theorem===
In 1826, Ostrogradsky gave the first general proof of the divergence theorem, which was discovered by Lagrange in 1762. This theorem may be expressed using Ostrogradsky&#x27;s equation:
: formula_1;
where &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, and &quot;R&quot; are differentiable functions of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; defined on the compact region &quot;V&quot; bounded by a smooth closed surface &quot;Σ&quot;; &quot;λ&quot;, &quot;μ&quot;, and &quot;ν&quot; are the angles that the outward normal to &quot;Σ&quot; makes with the positive &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; axes respectively; and d&quot;Σ&quot; is the surface area element on &quot;Σ&quot;.

===Ostrogradsky&#x27;s integration method===
His method for integrating rational functions is well known. First, we separate the rational part of the integral of a fractional rational function, the sum of the rational part (algebraic fraction) and the transcendental part (with the logarithm and the arctangent). Second, we determine the rational part without integrating it, and we assign a given integral in Ostrogradsky&#x27;s form:

:formula_2

where formula_3 are known polynomials of degrees &quot;p&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;y&quot; respectively; formula_4 is a known polynomial of degree not greater than formula_5; and formula_6 are unknown polynomials of degrees not greater than formula_7 and formula_8 respectively.

Third, formula_9 is the greatest common divisor of formula_10 and formula_11. Fourth, the denominator of the remaining integral formula_12 can be calculated from the equation formula_13.

When we differentiate both sides of the equation above, we get:formula_14,

where formula_15.

It can be shown that formula_16 is polynomial.

<text>The British Museum Reading Room, situated in the centre of the Great Court of the British Museum, used to be the main reading room of the British Library. In 1997, this function moved to the new British Library building at St Pancras, London, but the Reading Room remains in its original form at the British Museum.

Designed by Sydney Smirke and opened in 1857, the Reading Room was in continual use until its temporary closure for renovation in 1997. It was reopened in 2000, and from 2007 to 2017 it was used to stage temporary exhibitions. The reading room was closed to the public again in 2013 and converted for use as the museum&#x27;s archive. It was reopened for guided tours in 2023, and reopened for general visitors in July 2024.

== History ==
=== Construction and design ===
In the early 1850s the museum library was in need of a larger reading room and the then-Keeper of Printed Books, Antonio Panizzi, following an earlier competition idea by William Hosking, came up with the thought of a round room in the central courtyard. The building was designed by Sydney Smirke and was constructed between 1854 and 1857. The building used cast iron, concrete, glass and the latest technology in ventilation and heating. The dome, inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, has a diameter of 42.6 metres but is not technically free standing: constructed in segments on cast iron, the ceiling is suspended and made out of papier-mâché. Book stacks built around the reading room were made of iron to take the huge weight and add fire protection. There were forty kilometres of shelving in the stacks prior to the library&#x27;s relocation to the new site.

=== British Museum Library ===
The Reading Room was officially opened on 2 May 1857 with a &#x27;breakfast&#x27; (that included champagne and ice cream) laid out on the catalogue desks. A public viewing was held between 8 and 16 May, attracting over 62,000 visitors. Tickets to it included a plan of the library.

Regular users had to apply in writing and be issued a reader&#x27;s ticket by the Principal Librarian. During the period of the British Library, access was restricted to registered researchers only; however, reader&#x27;s credentials were generally available to anyone who could show that they were a serious researcher. The Reading Room was used by a large number of famous figures, including notably Sun Yat-sen, Karl Marx, Oscar Wilde, Friedrich Hayek, Marcus Garvey, Bram Stoker, Mahatma Gandhi, Rudyard Kipling, George Orwell, George Bernard Shaw, Mark Twain, Vladimir Lenin (using the name Jacob Richter), Virginia Woolf, Arthur Rimbaud, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, H. G. Wells, and Arthur Conan Doyle.

In 1973, the British Library Act 1972 detached the library department from the British Museum, but it continued to host the now separated British Library in the same Reading Room and building as the museum until 1997.


=== Restoration ===
In 1997 the British Library moved to its own specially constructed building next to St Pancras railway station and all the books and shelving were removed. As part of the redevelopment of the Great Court, the Reading Room was fully renovated and restored, including the papier-mâché ceiling which was repaired to its original colour scheme, having previously undergone radical redecorations (the initial design of the roof was considered excessive at the time).

The Reading Room was reopened in 2000, allowing all visitors, not just library ticket-holders, to enter it. It held a collection of 25,000 books focusing on the cultures represented in the museum along with an information centre and the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Centre.

=== Exhibition space ===
In 2007 the books and facilities installed in 2000 were removed, and the Reading Room was relaunched as a venue for special exhibitions, beginning with one featuring China&#x27;s Terracotta Army. The general library for visitors, Paul Hamlyn Library, was moved to a room accessible through nearby Room 2, but closed permanently on 13 August 2011. This is an earlier library that has also had distinguished users, including Thomas Babington Macaulay, William Makepeace Thackeray, Robert Browning, Giuseppe Mazzini, Charles Darwin, and Charles Dickens.

=== Closure and reopening ===
In 2013, the Reading Room was again closed to the public, this time indefinitely. With its role as an exhibition space superseded by the newer purpose-built World Conservation and Exhibitions Centre, the Reading Room was converted for use as the museum&#x27;s archive. It was briefly reopened in 2018, but for a series of concerts and not for its original purpose. For the rest of the 2010s and early 2020s, the Reading Room remained closed to the public, and museum officials were in discussions on what to do with the space.

In 2023, the Reading Room reopened to the public for guided tours. The tours, which are free, last approximately 20 minutes and must be booked in advance. Only one tour is conducted each week, at a specific time on a specific day; during the first wave of tours in March and April 2023, tours only ran on Tuesdays at 11:30 am. Visitors are monitored during the tour and are not permitted to borrow books or take photographs in the Reading Room.

==References in art and popular culture==

The British Museum Reading Room is the subject of an eponymous poem, &quot;The British Museum Reading Room&quot;, by Louis MacNeice. Much of the action of David Lodge&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;The British Museum Is Falling Down&quot; takes place in the old Reading Room. The &#x27;Glass Ceiling&#x27; of Anabel Donald&#x27;s 1994 novel is the ceiling of the Reading Room, where the denouement is set.

Alfred Hitchcock used the Reading Room and the dome of the British Museum as a location for the climax of his first sound film &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929). Other movies with key scenes in the Reading Room include &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; (1957) and in the 2001 Japanese anime OVA &quot;Read or Die&quot;, the Room is used as a secret entrance to the British Library&#x27;s fictional &quot;Special Operations Division&quot;.

In Sir Max Beerbohm&#x27;s short story, &quot;Enoch Soames&quot;, first published in May 1916, an obscure writer makes a deal with the Devil to visit the Reading Room one hundred years in the future, in order to know what posterity thinks about him and his work.

The British Museum and the Reading Room serve as the settings for &quot;An Encounter at the Museum&quot;, an anthology of romance novellas by Claudia Dain and Deb Marlowe, among others. 

Virginia Woolf made reference to the British Museum Reading Room in a passage from her 1929 essay, &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;. She wrote, &quot;The swing doors swung open, and there one stood under the vast dome as if one were a thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly encircled by a band of famous names.&quot;

Richard Henry Dana Jr. visited the Reading Room on 10 September 1860 with his London friend Henry T. Parker, and reported that Parker calls &amp; takes me to the British Museum, to see the Reading Room, wh. has been built since 1856 [Dana&#x27;s prior visit]. It is the room where students &amp; readers have their desks, &amp; consult the textbooks, cyclopedias, catalogs &amp;c., &amp; from wh. they send orders for books to the Library – the Library not being visited, at all, for study. There is no such room as this in Europe. It is a circle, with a dome, lighted from above, &amp; its diameter is 4 feet greater than that of the dome of St. Paul&#x27;s. The autographs are now open to the view of all, spread out in glass cases, – as well as much other lit. curiosities. This is the grandest Literary &amp; Scientific institution (not for instruction) in the world. The Reading Room, I told Parker, was a temple to the deification of Bibliology.

The writer Bernard Falk (1882–1960) quotes the British historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) as having declared that the Reading Room of the British Museum was a convenient asylum for imbeciles whose friends wished them out of mischief&#x27;s way.

<text>Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry. While modern computational geometry is a recent development, it is one of the oldest fields of computing with a history stretching back to antiquity.

Computational complexity is central to computational geometry, with great practical significance if algorithms are used on very large datasets containing tens or hundreds of millions of points. For such sets, the difference between O(&quot;n&quot;2) and O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) may be the difference between days and seconds of computation.

The main impetus for the development of computational geometry as a discipline was progress in computer graphics and computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), but many problems in computational geometry are classical in nature, and may come from mathematical visualization.

Other important applications of computational geometry include robotics (motion planning and visibility problems), geographic information systems (GIS) (geometrical location and search, route planning), integrated circuit design (IC geometry design and verification), computer-aided engineering (CAE) (mesh generation), and computer vision (3D reconstruction).

The main branches of computational geometry are:

*&quot;Combinatorial computational geometry&quot;, also called &quot;algorithmic geometry&quot;, which deals with geometric objects as discrete entities. A groundlaying book in the subject by Preparata and Shamos dates the first use of the term &quot;computational geometry&quot; in this sense by 1975.
* &quot;Numerical computational geometry&quot;, also called &quot;machine geometry&quot;, &quot;computer-aided geometric design&quot; (CAGD), or &quot;geometric modeling&quot;, which deals primarily with representing real-world objects in forms suitable for computer computations in CAD/CAM systems. This branch may be seen as a further development of descriptive geometry and is often considered a branch of computer graphics or CAD. The term &quot;computational geometry&quot; in this meaning has been in use since 1971.

Although most algorithms of computational geometry have been developed (and are being developed) for electronic computers, some algorithms were developed for unconventional computers (e.g. optical computers )

== Combinatorial computational geometry ==

The primary goal of research in combinatorial computational geometry is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures for solving problems stated in terms of basic geometrical objects: points, line segments, polygons, polyhedra, etc.

Some of these problems seem so simple that they were not regarded as problems at all until the advent of computers. Consider, for example, the &quot;Closest pair problem&quot;:

* Given &quot;n&quot; points in the plane, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.

One could compute the distances between all the pairs of points, of which there are &quot;n(n-1)/2&quot;, then pick the pair with the smallest distance. This brute-force algorithm takes O(&quot;n&quot;2) time; i.e. its execution time is proportional to the square of the number of points. A classic result in computational geometry was the formulation of an algorithm that takes O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;). Randomized algorithms that take O(&quot;n&quot;) expected time, as well as a deterministic algorithm that takes O(&quot;n&quot; log log &quot;n&quot;) time, have also been discovered.

=== Problem classes ===

The core problems in computational geometry may be classified in different ways, according to various criteria. The following general classes may be distinguished.

====Static problem====
In the problems of this category, some input is given and the corresponding output needs to be constructed or found. Some fundamental problems of this type are:

* Convex hull: Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points.
* Line segment intersection: Find the intersections between a given set of line segments.
* Delaunay triangulation
* Voronoi diagram: Given a set of points, partition the space according to which points are closest to the given points.
* Linear programming
* Closest pair of points: Given a set of points, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.
* Farthest pair of points
* Largest empty circle: Given a set of points, find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them. 
* Euclidean shortest path: Connect two points in a Euclidean space (with polyhedral obstacles) by a shortest path.
* Polygon triangulation: Given a polygon, partition its interior into triangles
* Mesh generation
* Boolean operations on polygons

The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by the time and space (computer memory) required to solve a given problem instance.

====Geometric query problems ====
In &quot;geometric query problems&quot;, commonly known as &quot;geometric search problems&quot;, the input consists of two parts: the search space part and the query part, which varies over the problem instances. The search space typically needs to be preprocessed, in a way that multiple queries can be answered efficiently.

Some fundamental geometric query problems are:

* Range searching: Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently count the number of points inside a query region.
* Point location problem: Given a partitioning of the space into cells, produce a data structure that efficiently tells in which cell a query point is located.
* Nearest neighbor: Preprocess a set of points, in order to efficiently find which point is closest to a query point.
* Ray tracing: Given a set of objects in space, produce a data structure that efficiently tells which object a query ray intersects first.

If the search space is fixed, the computational complexity for this class of problems is usually estimated by:
*the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in
*the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer queries.

For the case when the search space is allowed to vary, see &quot;Dynamic problems&quot;.

====Dynamic problems====

Yet another major class is the dynamic problems, in which the goal is to find an efficient algorithm for finding a solution repeatedly after each incremental modification of the input data (addition or deletion input geometric elements). Algorithms for problems of this type typically involve dynamic data structures. Any of the computational geometric problems may be converted into a dynamic one, at the cost of increased processing time. For example, the range searching problem may be converted into the dynamic range searching problem by providing for addition and/or deletion of the points. The dynamic convex hull problem is to keep track of the convex hull, e.g., for the dynamically changing set of points, i.e., while the input points are inserted or deleted.

The computational complexity for this class of problems is estimated by:
*the time and space required to construct the data structure to be searched in
*the time and space to modify the searched data structure after an incremental change in the search space
*the time (and sometimes an extra space) to answer a query.

====Variations====

Some problems may be treated as belonging to either of the categories, depending on the context. For example, consider the following problem.
* Point in polygon: Decide whether a point is inside or outside a given polygon.

In many applications this problem is treated as a single-shot one, i.e., belonging to the first class. For example, in many applications of computer graphics a common problem is to find which area on the screen is clicked by a pointer. However, in some applications, the polygon in question is invariant, while the point represents a query. For example, the input polygon may represent a border of a country and a point is a position of an aircraft, and the problem is to determine whether the aircraft violated the border. Finally, in the previously mentioned example of computer graphics, in CAD applications the changing input data are often stored in dynamic data structures, which may be exploited to speed-up the point-in-polygon queries.

In some contexts of query problems there are reasonable expectations on the sequence of the queries, which may be exploited either for efficient data structures or for tighter computational complexity estimates. For example, in some cases it is important to know the worst case for the total time for the whole sequence of N queries, rather than for a single query. See also &quot;amortized analysis&quot;.

== Numerical computational geometry ==

This branch is also known as geometric modelling and computer-aided geometric design (CAGD).

Core problems are curve and surface modelling and representation.

The most important instruments here are parametric curves and parametric surfaces, such as Bézier curves, spline curves and surfaces. An important non-parametric approach is the level-set method.

Application areas of computational geometry include shipbuilding, aircraft, and automotive industries.

<doc id="176931" wikidata="Q461" url="?curid=176931" title="Internet Archive">
<text>The Internet Archive is an American non-profit organization founded in 1996 by Brewster Kahle that runs a digital library website, archive.org. It provides free access to collections of digitized media including websites, software applications, music, audiovisual, and print materials. The Archive also advocates a free and open Internet. Its mission is committing to provide &quot;universal access to all knowledge&quot;.

The Internet Archive allows the public to upload and download digital material to its data cluster, but the bulk of its data is collected automatically by its web crawlers, which work to preserve as much of the public web as possible. Its web archive, the Wayback Machine, contains hundreds of billions of web captures. The Archive also oversees numerous book digitization projects, collectively one of the world&#x27;s largest book digitization efforts.

==History==
Brewster Kahle founded the Archive in May 1996, around the same time that he began the for-profit web crawling company Alexa Internet. The earliest known archived page on the site was saved on May 10, 1996, at 2:42 pm UTC (7:42 am PDT). By October of that year, the Internet Archive had begun to archive and preserve the World Wide Web in large amounts. The archived content became more easily available to the general public in 2001, through the Wayback Machine.

In late 1999, the Archive expanded its collections beyond the web archive, beginning with the Prelinger Archives. Now, the Internet Archive includes texts, audio, moving images, and software. It hosts a number of other projects: the NASA Images Archive, the contract crawling service Archive-It, and the wiki-editable library catalog and book information site Open Library. Soon after that, the Archive began working to provide specialized services relating to the information access needs of the print-disabled; publicly accessible books were made available in a protected Digital Accessible Information System (DAISY) format.

According to its website:

In August 2012, the Archive announced that it had added BitTorrent to its file download options for more than 1.3 million existing files, and all newly uploaded files. This method is the fastest means of downloading media from the Archive, as files are served from two Archive data centers, in addition to other torrent clients which have downloaded and continue to serve the files.

On November 6, 2013, the Internet Archive&#x27;s headquarters in San Francisco&#x27;s Richmond District caught fire, destroying equipment and damaging some nearby apartments. According to the Archive, it lost a side-building housing one of 30 of its scanning centers; cameras, lights, and scanning equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars; and &quot;maybe 20 boxes of books and film, some irreplaceable, most already digitized, and some replaceable&quot;. The nonprofit Archive sought donations to cover the estimated $600,000 in damage.

An overhaul of the site was launched as beta in November 2014, and the legacy layout was removed in March 2016.

In November 2016, Kahle announced that the Internet Archive was building the Internet Archive of Canada, a copy of the Archive to be based somewhere in Canada. The announcement received widespread coverage due to the implication that the decision to build a backup archive in a foreign country was because of the upcoming presidency of Donald Trump.

Beginning in 2017, OCLC and the Internet Archive have collaborated to make the Archive&#x27;s records of digitized books available in WorldCat.

Since 2018, the Internet Archive visual arts residency, which is organized by Amir Saber Esfahani and Andrew McClintock, helps connect artists with the Archive&#x27;s over 48 petabytes of digitized materials. Over the course of the yearlong residency, visual artists create a body of work which culminates in an exhibition. The hope is to connect digital history with the arts and create something for future generations to appreciate online or off. Previous artists in residence include Taravat Talepasand, Whitney Lynn, and Jenny Odell.

The Internet Archive acquires most materials from donations, such as hundreds of thousands of 78 rpm discs from Boston Public Library in 2017, a donation of 250,000 books from Trent University in 2018, and the entire collection of Marygrove College&#x27;s library after it closed in 2020. All material is then digitized and retained in digital storage, while a digital copy is returned to the original holder and the Internet Archive&#x27;s copy, if not in the public domain, is lent to patrons worldwide one at a time under the controlled digital lending (CDL) theory of the first-sale doctrine.

On June 1, 2020, four large publishing houses – Hachette Book Group, Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, and John Wiley – filed a lawsuit against the Internet Archive before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, claiming that the Internet Archive&#x27;s practice of controlled digital lending constituted copyright infringement. On March 25, 2023, the court found in favor of the publishers. The negotiated judgment of August 11, 2023, barred the Internet Archive from digitally lending books for which electronic copies are on sale.

Also on August 11, 2023, the music industry giants Universal Music Group, Sony Music and Concord (together with their respective labels Capitol Records, Arista Records and CMGI Recorded Music Assets) sued the Internet Archive before the same United States District Court for the Southern District of New York over the Internet Archive&#x27;s Great 78 Project for $621 million in damages from alleged copyright infringement.

In September 2024, Google and the Internet Archive signed a partnership to allow people to see previous versions of websites on Google Search that uses the Wayback Machine, without linking the Google Cache yet.

=== Cyberattacks ===
During the week of May 27, 2024, the Internet Archive suffered a series of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that made its services unavailable intermittently, sometimes for hours at a time, over a period of several days. The attack was claimed on May 28 by a hacker group called SN_BLACKMETA, with possible links to Anonymous Sudan. The incident drew a comparison with the 2023 British Library cyberattack, which affected the UK Web Archive.

Beginning October 9, 2024, the Internet Archive&#x27;s team, including archivist Jason Scott and security researcher Scott Helme, confirmed DDoS attacks, site defacement, and a data breach. The purported hacktivist group SN_BLACKMETA again claimed responsibility. A pop-up on the defaced site claimed that there was a &quot;catastrophic&quot; security breach, stating &quot;Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!&quot; It was reported that about 31 million user accounts were affected, and compromised in a file called &quot;ia_users.sql&quot;, dated September 28, 2024. The attackers stole users&#x27; email addresses and Bcrypt-hashed passwords. As of October 15, 2024, the website was still mostly offline for &quot;prioritizing keeping data safe at the expense of service availability.&quot; On October 11, Kahle said that the data is safe, and will bring the service back to normal &quot;in days, not weeks.&quot; On October 13, the Wayback Machine was restored in a read-only format, while archiving web pages was temporarily disabled. On October 14, Brewster Kahle said &quot;[the Wayback Machine] volume is back to normal: 1,500 requests per second&quot;. On October 20, threat actors stole unrotated API tokens and breached Internet Archive on its Zendesk email support platform; they also claimed responsibility for the other breaches yet stated that SN_BLACKMETA was behind just the DDoS attacks. On October 21, Internet Archive went back online in a read-only manner. On October 22, all Internet Archive services temporarily went offline, but later that same day, only the Wayback Machine, Archive-It, and blog.archive.org were resumed. On October 23, archive.org, the Wayback Machine, Archive-It, and the Open Library services all resumed but with some features, such as logging in, still unavailable until the staff announced it back available in the next day or two. On October 25, the login feature was made available and the site has remained active since.

== Operations ==

The Archive is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit operating in the United States. In 2019, it had an annual budget of $37 million, derived from revenue from its Web crawling services, various partnerships, grants, donations, and the Kahle-Austin Foundation. The Internet Archive also manages periodic funding campaigns. For instance, a December 2019 campaign had a goal of reaching $6 million in donations. It uses Ubuntu as its choice of operating system for the website servers.
The Archive is headquartered in San Francisco, California. From 1996 to 2009, its headquarters were in the Presidio of San Francisco, a former U.S. military base. Since 2009, its headquarters have been at 300 Funston Avenue in San Francisco, a former Christian Science Church. At one time, most of its staff worked in its book-scanning centers; as of 2019, scanning is performed by 100 paid operators worldwide. The Archive also has data centers in three Californian cities: San Francisco, Redwood City, and Richmond. To reduce the risk of data loss, the Archive creates copies of parts of its collection at more distant locations, including the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Egypt and a facility in Amsterdam.

Since 2016, Internet Archive started to work to create a decentralized prototype of the digital library. From 2020, content from Internet Archive started to be stored in Filecoin. By October 2023, one petabyte of data had been uploaded to the Filecoin network.

The Archive is a member of the International Internet Preservation Consortium and was officially designated as a library by the state of California in 2007.

==Web archiving==
===Wayback Machine===
The Wayback Machine is a service that allows archives of the World Wide Web to be searched and accessed. It can be used to see what previous versions of web sites used to look like or to visit web sites that no longer even exist. The Wayback Machine was created as a joint effort between Alexa Internet (owned by Amazon.com) and the Internet Archive. Hundreds of billions of web sites and their associated data (images, source code, documents, etc.) are saved in a database. , the Internet Archive held over 866 billion web pages, more than 42.5 million print materials, 13 million videos, 3 million TV news, 1.2 million software programs, 14 million audio files, 5 million images, and 272,660 concerts in its Wayback Machine.
===Archive-It===
Created in early 2006, Archive-It is a web archiving subscription service that allows institutions and individuals to build and preserve collections of digital content and create digital archives. Archive-It allows the user to customize their capture or exclusion of web content they want to preserve for cultural heritage reasons. Through a web application, Archive-It partners can harvest, catalog, manage, browse, search, and view their archived collections.

In terms of accessibility, the archived web sites are full text searchable within seven days of capture. Content collected through Archive-It is captured and stored as a WARC file. A primary and back-up copy is stored at the Internet Archive data centers. A copy of the WARC file can be given to subscribing partner institutions for geo-redundant preservation and storage purposes to their best practice standards. Periodically, the data captured through Archive-It is indexed into the Internet Archive&#x27;s general archive.

, Archive-It had more than 275 partner institutions in 46 U.S. states and 16 countries that have captured more than 7.4 billion URLs for more than 2,444 public collections. Archive-It partners are universities and college libraries, state archives, federal institutions, museums, law libraries, and cultural organizations, including the Electronic Literature Organization, North Carolina State Archives and Library, Stanford University, Columbia University, American University in Cairo, Georgetown Law Library, and many others.

===Internet Archive Scholar===

In September 2020, Internet Archive announced a new initiative to archive and preserve open access academic journals, called Internet Archive Scholar. Its full-text search index includes over 25 million research articles and other scholarly documents preserved in the Internet Archive. The collection spans from digitized copies of eighteenth century journals through the latest open access conference proceedings and pre-prints crawled from the World Wide Web.

=== General Index ===
In 2021, the Internet Archive announced the initial version of the General Index, a publicly available index to a collection of 107 million academic journal articles.

== Items and collections ==
The Archive stores files inside so-called items, which are similar to directories in that they can contain multiple files, but can have additional metadata such as a description and tags which make them more searchable.

Some file types can be previewed directly on the site, where as others have to be downloaded in order to be opened. If multiple multimedia files exist in an item, the website generates a playlist for video or audio files, or a slide show for pictures. If an item contains at least one video or picture, the Archive generates a preview thumbnail that can be seen on collection pages and in searches. Items can contain mixed data such as music files with an album cover picture, in which case the picture is used as thumbnail.

Staff members of the Internet Archive organize items by placing them into so-called collections, which are pages listing multiple items.

==Book collections==
===Text collection===

The scanning performed by the Internet Archive is financially supported by libraries and foundations. , when there were approximately 1 million texts, the entire collection was greater than 500 terabytes, which included raw camera images, cropped and skewed images, PDFs, and raw OCR data.

, the Internet Archive was operating 33 scanning centers in five countries, digitizing about 1,000 books a day for a total of more than 2 million books, in a total collection of 4.4 million booksincluding material digitized by others and fed into the Internet Archive; at that time, users were performing more than 15 million downloads per month.

The material digitized by others includes more than 300,000 books that were contributed to the collection, between about 2006 and 2008, by Microsoft through its Live Search Books project, which also included financial support and scanning equipment directly donated to the Internet Archive. On May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced it would be ending its Live Book Search project and would no longer be scanning books, donating its remaining scanning equipment to its former partners.

Around October 2007, Archive users began uploading public domain books from Google Book Search. , there were more than 900,000 Google-digitized books in the Archive&#x27;s collection; the books are identical to the copies found on Google, except without the Google watermarks, and are available for unrestricted use and download. Brewster Kahle revealed in 2013 that this archival effort was coordinated by Aaron Swartz, who, with a &quot;bunch of friends&quot;, downloaded the public domain books from Google slowly enough and from enough computers to stay within Google&#x27;s restrictions. They did this to ensure public access to the public domain. The Archive ensured the items were attributed and linked back to Google, which never complained, while libraries &quot;grumbled&quot;. According to Kahle, this is an example of Swartz&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot; to work on what could give the most to the public good for millions of people.

In addition to books, the Archive offers free and anonymous public access to more than four million court opinions, legal briefs, or exhibits uploaded from the United States Federal Courts&#x27; PACER electronic document system via the RECAP web browser plugin. These documents had been kept behind a federal court paywall. On the Archive, they had been accessed by more than six million people by 2013.

The Archive&#x27;s BookReader web app, built into its website, has features such as single-page, two-page, and thumbnail modes; fullscreen mode; page zooming of high-resolution images; and flip page animation.

In October 2024, the Internet Archive struck a deal with the Leiden University Library to accept the paper copies of 400,000 uncatalogued foreign dissertations held at the Library that were to be pulped – with a view to digitising them and making them accessible online. The collection includes theses by Niels Bohr, Marie Curie, Émile Durkheim, Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn, Carl Jung, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Max Planck, Luigi Pirandello, Gustav Stresemann and Max Weber.

===Open Library===
The Open Library is another project of the Internet Archive. The project seeks to include a web page for every book ever published: it holds 25 million catalog records of editions. It also seeks to be a web-accessible public library: it contains the full texts of approximately 1,600,000 public domain books (out of the more than five million from the main texts collection), as well as in-print and in-copyright books, many of which are fully readable, downloadable and full-text searchable; it offers a two-week loan of e-books in its controlled digital lending program for over 647,784 books not in the public domain, in partnership with over 1,000 library partners from six countries after a free registration on the web site. Open Library is a free and open-source software project, with its source code freely available on GitHub.

The Open Library faces objections from some authors and the Society of Authors, who hold that the project is distributing books without authorization and is thus in violation of copyright laws, and four major publishers initiated a copyright infringement lawsuit against the Internet Archive in June 2020 to stop the Open Library project.

===Digitizing sponsors for books===
Many large institutional sponsors have helped the Internet Archive provide millions of scanned publications (text items). Some sponsors that have digitized large quantities of texts include the University of Toronto&#x27;s Robarts Library, University of Alberta Libraries, University of Ottawa, Library of Congress, Boston Library Consortium member libraries, Boston Public Library, Princeton Theological Seminary Library, and many others.

In 2017, the MIT Press authorized the Internet Archive to digitize and lend books from the press&#x27;s backlist, with financial support from the Arcadia Fund. A year later, the Internet Archive received further funding from the Arcadia Fund to invite some other university presses to partner with the Internet Archive to digitize books, a project called &quot;Unlocking University Press Books&quot;.

The Library of Congress created numerous Handle System identifiers that pointed to free digitized books in the Internet Archive. The Internet Archive and Open Library are listed on the Library of Congress website as a source of e-books.

==Media collections==


In addition to web archives, the Internet Archive maintains extensive collections of digital media that are attested by the uploader to be in the public domain in the United States or licensed under a license that allows redistribution, such as Creative Commons licenses. Media are organized into collections by media type (moving images, audio, text, etc.), and into sub-collections by various criteria. Each of the main collections includes a &quot;Community&quot; sub-collection (formerly named &quot;Open Source&quot;) where general contributions by the public are stored.

===Audio===
====Audio Archive====
The Audio Archive includes music, audiobooks, news broadcasts, old time radio shows, podcasts, and a wide variety of other audio files. , there are more than 15,000,000 free digital recordings in the collection. The subcollections include audio books and poetry, podcasts, non-English audio, and many others. The sound collections are curated by B. George, director of the ARChive of Contemporary Music.

====Digital Library of Amateur Radio and Communications====
A project to preserve recordings of amateur radio transmissions, with funding from the Amateur Radio Digital Communications foundation.

====Live Music Archive====

The Live Music Archive sub-collection includes more than 170,000 concert recordings from independent musicians, as well as more established artists and musical ensembles with permissive rules about recording their concerts, such as the Grateful Dead, and more recently, The Smashing Pumpkins. Also, Jordan Zevon has allowed the Internet Archive to host a definitive collection of his father Warren Zevon&#x27;s concert recordings. The Zevon collection ranges from 1976 to 2001 and contains 126 concerts including 1,137 songs.

====The Great 78 Project====

The Great 78 Project aims to digitize 250,000 78 rpm singles (500,000 songs) from the period between 1880 and 1960, donated by various collectors and institutions. It has been developed in collaboration with the Archive of Contemporary Music and George Blood Audio, responsible for the audio digitization.

==== Netlabels ====

The Archive has a collection of freely distributable music that is streamed and available for download via its &quot;Netlabels&quot; service. The music in this collection generally has Creative Commons-license catalogs of virtual record labels.

===Images collection===
This collection contains more than 3.5 million items. Cover Art Archive, Metropolitan Museum of Art – Gallery Images, NASA Images, Occupy Wall Street Flickr Archive, and USGS Maps are some sub-collections of Image collection.

====Cover Art Archive====

The Cover Art Archive is a joint project between the Internet Archive and MusicBrainz, whose goal is to make cover art images on the Internet. this collection contains more than 1,400,000 items.

====Metropolitan Museum of Art images====
The images of this collection are from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This collection contains more than 140,000 items.

====NASA Images====
The NASA Images archive was created through a Space Act Agreement between the Internet Archive and NASA to bring public access to NASA&#x27;s image, video, and audio collections in a single, searchable resource. The Internet Archive NASA Images team worked closely with all of the NASA centers to keep adding to the ever-growing collection. The nasaimages.org site launched in July 2008 and had more than 100,000 items online at the end of its hosting in 2012.

====Occupy Wall Street Flickr archive====
This collection contains Creative Commons-licensed photographs from Flickr related to the Occupy Wall Street movement. This collection contains more than 15,000 items.

====USGS Maps====
This collection contains more than 59,000 items from Libre Map Project.

===Machinima Archive===
One of the sub-collections of the Internet Archive&#x27;s Video Archive is the Machinima Archive. This small section hosts many Machinima videos. Machinima is a digital artform in which computer games, game engines, or software engines are used in a sandbox-like mode to create motion pictures, recreate plays, or even publish presentations or keynotes. The archive collects a range of Machinima films from internet publishers such as Rooster Teeth and Machinima.com as well as independent producers. The sub-collection is a collaborative effort among the Internet Archive, the How They Got Game research project at Stanford University, the Academy of Machinima Arts and Sciences, and Machinima.com.

===Microfilm collection===
This collection contains approximately 160,000 microfilmed items from a variety of libraries including the University of Chicago Libraries, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Alberta, Allen County Public Library, and National Technical Information Service.

===Moving image collection===

The Internet Archive holds a collection of approximately 3,863 feature films. Additionally, the Internet Archive&#x27;s Moving Image collection includes: newsreels, classic cartoons, pro- and anti-war propaganda, The Video Cellar Collection, Skip Elsheimer&#x27;s &quot;A.V. Geeks&quot; collection, early television, and ephemeral material from Prelinger Archives, such as advertising, educational, and industrial films, as well as amateur and home movie collections.

Subcategories of this collection include:
* IA&#x27;s &quot;Brick Films&quot; collection, which contains stop-motion animation filmed with Lego bricks, some of which are &quot;remakes&quot; of feature films.
* IA&#x27;s &quot;Election 2004&quot; collection, a non-partisan public resource for sharing video materials related to the 2004 United States presidential election.
* IA&#x27;s &quot;FedFlix&quot; collection, Joint Venture NTIS-1832 between the National Technical Information Service and Public.Resource.Org that features &quot;the best movies of the United States Government, from training films to history, from our national parks to the U.S. Fire Academy and the Postal Inspectors&quot;
* IA&#x27;s &quot;Independent News&quot; collection, which includes sub-collections such as the Internet Archive&#x27;s World At War competition from 2001, in which contestants created short films demonstrating &quot;why access to history matters&quot;. Among their most-downloaded video files are eyewitness recordings of the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
* IA&#x27;s &quot;September 11 Television Archive&quot;, which contains archival footage from the world&#x27;s major television networks of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as they unfolded on live television.

===Open Educational Resources===

Open Educational Resources is a digital collection at archive.org. This collection contains hundreds of free courses, video lectures, and supplemental materials from universities in the United States and China. The contributors of this collection are ArsDigita University, Hewlett Foundation, MIT, Monterey Institute, and Naropa University.

===TV News Search &amp; Borrow===

In September 2012, the Internet Archive launched the TV News Search &amp; Borrow service for searching U.S. national news programs. The service is built on closed captioning transcripts and allows users to search and stream 30-second video clips. Upon launch, the service contained &quot;350,000 news programs collected over 3 years from national U.S. networks and stations in San Francisco and Washington D.C.&quot; According to Kahle, the service was inspired by the Vanderbilt Television News Archive, a similar library of televised network news programs. In contrast to Vanderbilt, which limits access to streaming video to individuals associated with subscribing colleges and universities, the TV News Search &amp; Borrow allows open access to its streaming video clips. In 2013, the Archive received an additional donation of &quot;approximately 40,000 well-organized tapes&quot; from the estate of a Philadelphia woman, Marion Stokes. Stokes &quot;had recorded more than 35 years of TV news in Philadelphia and Boston with her VHS and Betamax machines.&quot;

===Miscellaneous collections===
Brooklyn Museum collection contains approximately 3,000 items from Brooklyn Museum. In December 2020, the film research library of Lillian Michelson was donated to the archive.

==Other services and endeavors==
===Physical media===
Voicing a strong reaction to the idea of books simply being thrown away, and inspired by the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Kahle now envisions collecting one copy of every book ever published. &quot;We&#x27;re not going to get there, but that&#x27;s our goal&quot;, he said. Alongside the books, Kahle plans to store the Internet Archive&#x27;s old servers, which were replaced in 2010.

===Software===
The Internet Archive has &quot;the largest collection of historical software online in the world&quot;, spanning 50 years of computer history in terabytes of computer magazines and journals, books, shareware discs, FTP sites, video games, etc. The Internet Archive has created an archive of what it describes as &quot;vintage software&quot;, as a way to preserve them. The project advocated an exemption from the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act to permit them to bypass copy protection, which the United States Copyright Office approved in 2003 for a period of three years. The Archive does not offer the software for download, as the exemption is solely &quot;for the purpose of preservation or archival reproduction of published digital works by a library or archive.&quot; The Library of Congress renewed the exemption in 2006, and in 2009 indefinitely extended it pending further rulemakings. The Library reiterated the exemption as a &quot;Final Rule&quot; with no expiration date in 2010. In 2013, the Internet Archive began to provide select video games browser-playable via MESS, for instance the Atari 2600 game &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Since December 23, 2014, the Internet Archive presents, via a browser-based DOSBox emulation, thousands of DOS/PC games for &quot;scholarship and research purposes only&quot;. In November 2020, the Archive introduced a new emulator for Adobe Flash called Ruffle, and began archiving Flash animations and games ahead of the December 31, 2020, end-of-life for the Flash plugin across all computer systems.

===Table Top Scribe System===
A combined hardware software system has been developed that performs a safe method of digitizing content.

===Credit Union===
From 2012 to November 2015, the Internet Archive operated the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union, a federal credit union based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, with the goal of providing access to low- and middle-income people. Throughout its short existence, the IAFCU experienced significant conflicts with the National Credit Union Administration, which severely limited the IAFCU&#x27;s loan portfolio and concerns over serving Bitcoin firms. At the time of its dissolution, it consisted of 395 members and was worth $2.5 million.

=== Decentralization ===
Since 2019, the Internet Archive organizes an event called Decentralized Web Camp (DWeb Camp). It is an annual camp that brings together a diverse global community of contributors in a natural setting. The camp aims to tackle real-world challenges facing the web and co-create decentralized technologies for a better internet. It aims to foster collaboration, learning, and fun while promoting principles of trust, human agency, mutual respect, and ecological awareness.

===Wayforward Machine===

On September 30, 2021, as a part of its 25th anniversary celebration, Internet Archive launched the &quot;Wayforward Machine&quot;, a satirical, fictional website covered with pop-ups asking for personal information. The site was intended to depict a fictional dystopian timeline of real-world events leading to such a future, such as the repeal of Section 230 of the United States Code in 2022 and the introduction of advertising implants in 2041.

=== Ceramic archivists collection ===
The Great Room of the Internet Archive features a collection of more than 100 ceramic figures representing employees of the Internet Archive, with the 100th statue immortalizing Aaron Swartz. This collection, inspired by the statues of the Xian warriors in China, was commissioned by Brewster Kahle, sculpted by Nuala Creed, and as of 2014, is ongoing.

=== Artists in residence ===
The Internet Archive visual arts residency, organized by Amir Saber Esfahani, is designed to connect emerging and mid-career artists with the Archive&#x27;s millions of collections and to show what is possible when open access to information intersects with the arts. During this one-year residency, selected artists develop a body of work that responds to and utilizes the Archive&#x27;s collections in their own practice.

* 2019 Residency Artists: Caleb Duarte, Whitney Lynn, and Jeffrey Alan Scudder
* 2018 Residency Artists: Mieke Marple, Chris Sollars, and Taravat Talepasand
* 2017 Residency Artists: Laura Kim, Jeremiah Jenkins, and Jenny Odell

==Controversies, legal disputes, and activism==

=== Opposition to National security letters, bills and settlements ===

On May 8, 2008, it was revealed that the Internet Archive had successfully challenged an FBI national security letter asking for logs on an undisclosed user.

On November 28, 2016, it was revealed that a second FBI national security letter had been successfully challenged that had been asking for logs on another undisclosed user.

The Internet Archive blacked out its web site for 12 hours on January 18, 2012, in protest of the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act bills, two pieces of legislation in the United States Congress that they argued would &quot;negatively affect the ecosystem of web publishing that led to the emergence of the Internet Archive&quot;. This occurred in conjunction with the English Wikipedia blackout, as well as numerous other protests across the Internet.

The Internet Archive is a member of the Open Book Alliance, which has been among the most outspoken critics of the Google Book Settlement. The Archive advocates an alternative digital library project.

===Hosting of disputed media===
On October 9, 2016, the Internet Archive was temporarily blocked in Turkey after it was used (amongst other file hosting services) by hackers to host 17 GB of leaked government emails.

Because the Internet Archive only lightly moderates uploads, it includes resources that may be valued by extremists and the site may be used by them to evade block listing. In February 2018, the Counter Extremism Project said that the Archive hosted terrorist videos, including the beheading of Alan Henning, and had declined to respond to requests about the videos. In May 2018, a report published by the cyber-security firm Flashpoint stated that the Islamic State was using the Internet Archive to share its propaganda. Chris Butler, from the Internet Archive, responded that they regularly spoke to the US and EU governments about sharing information on terrorism. In April 2019, Europol, acting on a referral from French police, asked the Internet Archive to remove 550 sites of &quot;terrorist propaganda&quot;. The Archive rejected the request, saying that the reports were wrong about the content they pointed to, or were too broad for the organization to comply with. On July 14, 2021, the Internet Archive held a joint &quot;Referral Action Day&quot; with Europol to target terrorist videos.

A 2021 article said that jihadists regularly used the Internet Archive for &quot;dead drops&quot; of terrorist videos. In January 2022, a former UCLA lecturer&#x27;s 800-page manifesto, containing racist ideas and threats against UCLA staff, was uploaded to the Internet Archive. The manifesto was removed by the Internet Archive after a week, amidst discussion about whether such documents should be preserved by archivists or not. Another 2022 paper found &quot;an alarming volume of terrorist, extremist, and racist material on the Internet Archive&quot;. A 2023 paper reported that Neo-Nazis collect links to online, publicly available resources to be shared with new recruits. As the Internet Archive hosts uploaded texts that are not allowed on other websites, Nazi and neo-Nazi books in the Archive (e.g., &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;) frequently appear on these lists. These lists also feature older, public domain material created when white supremacist views were more mainstream.

===2020 National Emergency Library===
In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic which closed many schools, universities, and libraries, the Archive announced on March 24, 2020, that it was creating the National Emergency Library by removing the lending restrictions it had in place for 1.4 million digitized books in its Open Library but otherwise limiting users to the number of books they could check out and enforcing their return; normally, the site would only allow one digital lending for each physical copy of the book they had, by use of an encrypted file that would become unusable after the lending period was completed. This Library would remain as such until at least June 30, 2020, or until the US national emergency was over, whichever came later. At launch, the Internet Archive allowed authors and rightholders to submit opt-out requests for their works to be omitted from the National Emergency Library.

The Internet Archive said the National Emergency Library addressed an &quot;unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research material&quot; due to the closures of physical libraries worldwide. They justified the move in a number of ways. Legally, they said they were promoting access to those inaccessible resources, which they claimed was an exercise in fair use principles. The Archive continued implementing their controlled digital lending policy that predated the National Emergency Library, meaning they still encrypted the lent copies and it was no easier for users to create new copies of the books than before. An ultimate determination of whether or not the National Emergency Library constituted fair use could only be made by a court. Morally, they also pointed out that the Internet Archive was a registered library like any other, that they either paid for the books themselves or received them as donations, and that lending through libraries predated copyright restrictions.

The Archive had already been criticized by authors and publishers for its prior lending approach, and upon announcement of the National Emergency Library, authors, publishers, and groups representing both took further issue with The Archive and its Open Library project, equating the move to copyright infringement and digital piracy, and using the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason to push the boundaries of copyright. After the works of some of these authors were ridiculed in responses, the Internet Archive&#x27;s Jason Scott requested that supporters of the National Emergency Library not denigrate anyone&#x27;s books: &quot;I realize there&#x27;s strong debate and disagreement here, but books are life-giving and life-changing and these writers made them.&quot;

==Copyright issues==
In November 2005, free downloads of Grateful Dead concerts were removed from the site, following what seemed to be disagreements between some of the former band members. John Perry Barlow identified Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Bill Kreutzmann as the instigators of the change, according to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Phil Lesh, a founding member of the band, commented on the change in a November 30, 2005, posting to his personal web site:

A November 30 forum post from Brewster Kahle summarized what appeared to be the compromise reached among the band members. Audience recordings could be downloaded or streamed, but soundboard recordings were to be available for streaming only. Concerts have since been re-added.

In February 2016, Internet Archive users had begun archiving digital copies of &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, Nintendo&#x27;s official magazine for their games and products, which ran from 1988 to 2012. The first 140 issues had been collected, before Nintendo had the archive removed on August 8, 2016. In response to the take-down, Nintendo told gaming website &quot;Polygon&quot;, &quot;[Nintendo] must protect our own characters, trademarks and other content. The unapproved use of Nintendo&#x27;s intellectual property can weaken our ability to protect and preserve it, or to possibly use it for new projects&quot;.

In August 2017, the Department of Telecommunications of the Government of India blocked the Internet Archive along with other file-sharing websites, in accordance with two court orders issued by the Madras High Court, citing piracy concerns after copies of two Bollywood films were allegedly shared via the service. The HTTP version of the Archive was blocked but it remained accessible using the HTTPS protocol.

In 2023, the Internet Archive became a popular site for Indians to watch the first episode of &quot;&quot;, a BBC documentary released on January 17 and banned in India by January 20. The video was reported to have been removed by the Archive on January 23. The Internet Archive then stated, on January 27, that they had removed the video in response to a BBC request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

===Book publishers&#x27; lawsuit===

The operation of the National Emergency Library was part of a lawsuit filed against the Internet Archive by four major book publishers—Hachette, HarperCollins, John Wiley &amp; Sons, and Penguin Random House—in June 2020, challenging the copyright validity of the controlled digital lending program. In response, the Internet Archive closed the National Emergency Library on June 16, 2020, rather than the planned June 30, 2020, due to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs, supported by the Copyright Alliance, claimed in their lawsuit that the Internet Archive&#x27;s actions constituted a &quot;willful mass copyright infringement.&quot;

Judge Koeltl ruled on March 24, 2023, against Internet Archive in the case, saying the National Emergency Library concept was not fair use, so the Archive infringed their copyrights by lending out the books without the waitlist restriction. An agreement was then reached for the Internet Archive to pay an undisclosed amount to the publishers. The Internet Archive appealed the ruling. On September 4, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the district court&#x27;s ruling, calling the Internet Archive&#x27;s argument that they were shielded by fair use doctrine &quot;unpersuasive&quot;.

=== Music publishers&#x27; lawsuit ===
In August 2023, the music industry corporations Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music and Concord sued the Internet Archive over its Great 78 Project, asserting the project was engaged in copyright infringement. The Great 78 Project stores digitized versions of pre-1972 songs and albums from 78 rpm phonograph records, for &quot;the preservation, research and discovery of 78rpm records.&quot; The project had started in 2016, when pre-1972 recordings had not been protected by copyright; in 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the Music Modernization Act (MMA) which enabled legal remedies for unauthorised use of pre-1972 recordings until 2067, thus effectively covering them with copyright.

UMG and Sony had been the two largest companies in this sector for more than a decade, with respective market shares of 31.8% and 22.1% in 2023. Concord was a rapidly expanding music business closely partnered with UMG since its transformation into Concord Music Group in 2004 and backed since at least 2000 by J.P. Morgan. It was the first music company to perform an asset-backed securitization, led by Apollo Global Management, in December 2022. Its assets consisted of over 1 million copyrights to music older than 18 months. According to its CEO Bob Valentine, Concord derived about 85% of its revenue &quot;from catalog, rather than newly-developed, music&quot;. As Valentine stated in his first interview, &quot;The phenomenon of artists&#x27; IP has never been more liquid; it is now a real and proven asset class. Investment bankers are focused on it, financiers are financing it, and then there&#x27;s entities like us, that know how to buy rights, but also know how to manage them and have the relationships to do so.&quot; The share of catalog music in total album equivalent consumption in the United States rose from 62.8% to 72.6% between 2019 and 2023.

The publishers are seeking statutory damages for nearly 4,142 songs named in the suit, with a maximum possible fine of $621 million. The Internet Archive has argued that the primitive sound quality of the original recordings falls within the doctrine of &quot;fair use&quot; to digitize for preservation, that the number of downloads is so small it has almost no impact on the publishers&#x27; revenue, and over 95% of the collection is not readily available anywhere else. The plaintiffs said in response, &quot;if ever there were a theory of fair use invented for litigation, this is it.&quot; According to a legal source at Mayer Brown, the music publishers&#x27; case could be challenged as unconstitutional, since the granting of copyright to pre-1972 works in the MMA only benefitted record companies without having a systemic effect.

<text>The Polikarpov I-16 () is a Soviet single-engine single-seat fighter aircraft of revolutionary design; it was the world&#x27;s first low-wing cantilever monoplane fighter with retractable landing gear to attain operational status and as such &quot;introduced a new vogue in fighter design&quot;. The I-16 was introduced in the mid-1930s and formed the backbone of the Soviet Air Force at the beginning of World War II. The diminutive fighter, nicknamed &quot;Ishak&quot; or &quot;Ishachok&quot; (&quot;donkey&quot; or &quot;burro&quot;) by Soviet pilots, figured prominently in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, Winter War and the Spanish Civil War – where it was called the &#x27; (&quot;rat&quot;) by the Nationalists or &#x27; (&quot;fly&quot;) by the Republicans. The Finns called the aircraft  &quot;(flying squirrel)&quot;.

==Design and development==
While working on the Polikarpov I-15 biplane, Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov began designing an advanced monoplane fighter. It featured cutting-edge innovations such as retractable landing gear and a fully enclosed cockpit, and was optimized for speed with a short stubby fuselage, and a Wright R-1820 radial engine in a NACA cowling. The aircraft is small, light and simple to build.

Full-scale work on the TsKB-12 prototype began in June 1933, and the aircraft was accepted into production on 22 November 1933, a month before it took to the air. The TsKB-12 was of mixed construction, using a wooden monocoque fuselage and wings employing a KhMA chrome-molybdenum steel alloy wing spar, dural ribs and D1 aluminum alloy skinning on the center and leading edges, with the remaining portions of the wings fabric-covered. Another modern feature were the ailerons which ran along almost the entire trailing edge of the wing and also operated as flaps (in the manner of more modern flaperons) by drooping 15°. The cockpit was covered by a 40-centimetre-wide (16 in) canopy which featured an Aldis-type tubular gun sight which could slide back and forth on runners fitted with rubber bungee cords. A 225 L (59.4 US gal) fuel tank was fitted directly in front of the cockpit. The main landing gear is fully retractable by a hand crank. The armament consisted of a pair of 7.62×54mmR (0.30 in) ShKAS machine guns in the wings, mounted on the outboard side of the main gear and 900 rounds of ammunition. 

These features were proposed at first by Andrei Tupolev; however, the NII VVS (Air Force Scientific Test Institute) was more concerned about the stresses a typical combat aircraft was subjected to in combat, and initially considered the risk too great. However, TsAGI, with the help of the 3rd Design Brigade under the leadership of Pavel Sukhoi and Aleksandr Putylov, eventually convinced NII VVS that what was being proposed was not only feasible, but would enhance the aircraft&#x27;s performance.

The TsKB-12 was designed for the Wright Cyclone SR-1820-F-3 9-cylinder radial engine (rated at 529 kW/710 hp); a license to build this engine under the supervision of the OKB-19 Shvetsov design bureau in the Soviet Union was being negotiated. As the license was not yet approved, Polikarpov was asked to settle for the less powerful M-22 (Soviet-built version of the Gnome-Rhone Jupiter 9ASB, which itself was a licensed version of the Bristol Jupiter VI) with 358 kW (480 hp). This was deemed acceptable because the projected top speed still exceeded 300 km/h (185 mph). 

The M-22-powered TsKB-12 first took to the air on 30 December 1933 with the famous Soviet test pilot Valery Chkalov at the controls. The second TsKB-12, with a Cyclone engine and three-bladed propeller, flew in January of the following year. Initial government trials in February 1934 revealed very good maneuverability, but the aircraft did not tolerate abrupt control inputs. Thus the TsKB-12 was deemed dangerous to fly and all aerobatics were forbidden. The M-22 version was preferred due to the vibration of the Cyclone-powered aircraft. Pilots commented early on about the difficulty of climbing into the cockpit, a trait that persisted through the I-16&#x27;s service life. Before continuing test flights the designers had to answer the question of spin behavior. Wind tunnel testing suggested that the TsKB-12, with its short tail, would enter an unrecoverable spin, but real-life trials were necessary to confirm this. Since Cyclone engines were rare, it was decided to risk the M-22 prototype for this purpose. On 1 and 2 March 1934, Chkalov performed 75 spins and discovered that the aircraft had very benign stall behavior (dipping a wing and recovering without input from the pilot when airspeed increased) and intentional spins could be easily terminated by placing the controls in the neutral position. The stories of vicious spin behavior of the I-16 perpetuated in modern literature is unfounded (perhaps extrapolated from Gee Bee experience). In fact, the I-16&#x27;s stablemate, the biplane Polikarpov I-153, exhibited much worse spin characteristics. 

Service trials of the new fighter, designated I-16, began on 22 March 1934. The M-22 prototype reached 359 km/h (223 mph). The pioneering presence of a complex, triple-strut manually retracted main landing gear design was prone to jamming and required considerable strength from the pilot, who directly operated the rearmost strut&#x27;s upper end, moved with a manually turned jackscrew running spanwise within the wing structure, to &quot;slide&quot; outwards and inwards on each side to respectively get the main gear retracted and extended, with the main strut (the forward-most of the trio) needing to shorten its length during its retraction to fit the mainwheel into the lower fuselage, performed by the middle-location strut&#x27;s geometric arrangement and pivot locations. Most of the test flights were performed with the gear extended. On 14 April 1934, the Cyclone prototype was damaged when one of the landing gear legs collapsed while it was taxiing. On 1 May 1934, the M-22 prototype participated in the flyover of Red Square. Approximately thirty I-16 Type 1 aircraft were delivered, but were not assigned to any VVS fighter squadron. Most pilots who flew the I-16 Type 1 for evaluation purposes did not find the aircraft to have many redeeming characteristics. Regardless of pilot opinion, much attention was focused on the Cyclone-powered aircraft and the M-25 (the license-built Cyclone). 

The third prototype with a Cyclone engine incorporated a series of aerodynamic improvements and was delivered for government trials on 7 September 1934. The top speed of 437 km/h (270 mph) no longer satisfied the Air Force, who now wanted the experimental Nazarov M-58 engine and 470 km/h (290 mph). Subsequently, the M-22-powered version entered production at Factory 21 in Nizhny Novgorod and Factory 39 in Moscow. Because it was the fourth aircraft produced by these factories, it received the designation I-16 Type 4. Aircraft fitted with these new engines required a slightly changed airframe, including armor plating for the pilot and changes to the landing gear doors (particularly, the hinged lower mainwheel door) to allow for complete closure.

The M-25 fitted I-16, the I-16 Type 5, featured a new engine cowling which was slightly smaller in diameter and featured nine forward-facing, radially-set shuttered openings to control cooling airflow, a redesigned exhaust with eight individual outlet stubs, and other changes. The M-25 was rated at 474 kW (635 hp) at sea level and 522 kW (700 hp) at 2,300 m (7,546 ft). Due to the poor quality of the canopy glazing, the I-16 Type 5 pilots typically left the canopy open or removed the rear portion completely. By the time the Type 5 arrived, it was the world&#x27;s lightest production fighter (1,460 kg/3,219 lb), as well as the world&#x27;s fastest, able to reach speeds of 454 km/h (282 mph) at altitude and 395 km/h (245 mph) at sea level. While the Type 5 could not perform the high-G maneuvers of other fighters, it possessed superior speed and climb rates, and had extremely responsive aileron control, which gave it a very good roll rate, which led to precision maneuvers in loops and split-Ss.

A total of 10,292 single-seat aircraft were produced between 1935 and 1942; the number of two-seat trainer variants produced varies between 843 and 3,189.

==Operational history==
Initial service experience revealed that the ShKAS machine guns had a tendency to jam. This was the result of the guns being installed in the wings upside-down to facilitate the fit. The problem was addressed in later modifications. Evaluations from pilots confirmed the experience with prototypes. Controls were light and very sensitive, abrupt maneuvers resulted in spins, and spin behavior was excellent. An aileron roll could be performed in under 1.5 seconds (roll rate over 240 degrees/second). The machine guns were fired via a cable and the required effort, coupled with sensitive controls, made precision aiming difficult. The rear weight bias made the I-16 easy to handle on unprepared airfields because the aircraft was rather unlikely to flip over the nose even if the front wheels dug in.

The I-16 was a difficult fighter to fly. The pilots had poor visibility, the canopy tended to become fouled with engine oil, and the moving portion was prone to slamming shut during hard maneuvers, which caused many pilots to fix it in the open position. The front section of the fuselage, with the engine, was too close to the centre of gravity, and the pilot&#x27;s cockpit too far to the rear. The Polikarpov had insufficient longitudinal stability and it was impossible to fly the aircraft &quot;hands off&quot;.

===Spanish Civil War===
At the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Republican forces pleaded for fighter aircraft. After receiving payment in gold, Joseph Stalin dispatched around 475 I-16 Type 5s and Type 6s. The first I-16s appeared in Spanish skies in November 1936. The Polikarpov monoplanes had their baptism of fire on 13 November 1936, when twelve I-16s intercepted a Nationalist bombing raid on Madrid. Soviet pilots claimed four air victories and two German Heinkel He 51 pilots were killed. But the Soviets suffered losses too; the group commander collided with an enemy aircraft and another I-16 pilot crash landed. The Polikarpovs immediately began dominating the enemy Heinkel He 51 and Arado Ar 68 biplanes and remained unchallenged until the introduction of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The arrival of the newest Bf 109Bs and the overwhelming numerical superiority of Nationalist fighters were the primary cause of the heavy I-15 and I-16 combat losses suffered throughout 1937. A number of aviation publications called the new Soviet fighter a &quot;Boeing&quot; due to the incorrect assumption that it was based on the Boeing P-26&#x27;s design. The Nationalists nicknamed the stubby fighter &quot;Rata&quot; (Rat), while the Republicans affectionately called it &quot;Mosca&quot; (Fly).

Combat experience showed that the I-16 had deficiencies; several aircraft were lost after structural failure of the wings, which was quickly remedied by reinforced structures. Heavy machine gun bullets could sometimes penetrate the armored backrest, and fuel tanks occasionally caught fire in spite of being protected. The hot Spanish summers required the addition of oil radiators, and dust adversely affected the life of the engines. Although some aircraft accumulated up to 400 hours of flying time, the average life of an I-16 was 87 days, of which one sixth was spent on maintenance. The biggest complaint in service was the light armament of only two 7.62 mm (0.30 in) machine guns. This was urgently addressed with the Type 6 which added a third ShKAS in the bottom of the fuselage. The four-gun Type 10 was nicknamed &quot;Super Mosca&quot; or simply &quot;Super&quot;.
The total number of I-16s delivered to Spain from 1936 to 1938 amounted to 276. When the war ended on 1 April 1939, 187 &quot;Ratas&quot; had been lost in Spain: 112 lost in combat, one shot down by anti-aircraft fire, eleven destroyed on the ground, one force-landed and 62 lost in accidents.

===China, the Far East, and battles at Khalkhin Gol===

Between October 1937 and September 1939 the USSR delivered 885 aircraft (rising to 1,250 by 1941), including 216 Polikarpov I-16s, predominately Type 5s and Type 10s. At first the Soviet pilots would have to fly the aircraft over 1,500 miles across China to get them to their destination of Lanzhou, however this was a risky journey and so future batches of aircraft would be disassembled and transported to Hami (closer to Lanzhou), before final assembly and delivery to Lanzhou. The first I-16s were delivered in November 1937, however rushed training of the Chinese pilots meant many were lost to crashes. In Chinese service the I-16 became known as the &quot;Lastochka&quot; or &quot;Swallow&quot;. In the early years of the war the I-16 was a capable fighter, however from 1939 onwards its performance was deemed to be lacking in comparison to newer fighters.

A number Chinese aces flew the I-16; among them Lo Ying-Teh who in 1938 shot down Japanese unit leader Lt Ryohei Ushioda&#x27;s A5M2 in his I-16 Type 5. .Another ace to fly the I-16 was Liu Chi-Sheng who achieved 3 of his 10 kills while flying the I-16 Type 5, along with another shared kill.

Another 250 I-16 Type 10s were supplied to China. This model added a second set of 7.62 mm (0.30 in) ShKAS machine guns, armor behind the pilot, and had a slightly upgraded 560 kW (750 hp) M-25 engine. In 1939, of the 500 I-16s deployed to the fighting at Nomonhan, approximately 112 were lost during the battles of Khalkhin Gol, of which 88 were destroyed in aerial combat, primarily against the all-metal Nakajima Ki-27 Japanese fighters. During test trials in Russia of a captured Ki-27, the aircraft proved superior to the Soviet I-152 (I-15bis), I-153, and the I-16 in aerial combat, as well as having a faster take-off and lower landing speed, requiring shorter airstrips than the I-16, which needed 270 meters to stop and 380 meters for take-off.

Further attempts were made to upgrade the firepower of the aircraft using 20 mm (0.79 in) ShVAK cannons, making the I-16 one of the most heavily armed fighters of the period, able to fire 28 rounds of ammunition in three seconds. Pilots loved the results, but the cannons were in short supply, and only a small number of the I-16 Type 12, 17, 27, and 28 were built. The Chung 28 is an unlicensed I-16 built from the spare parts of I-16s provided to the Nationalists, delivered in 1941 and did not include upgraded cannons. The cannons adversely affected performance, with 360° turn time increasing from fifteen seconds in the Type 5 to eighteen seconds. The Type 24 replaced the skid with a tailwheel and featured the much more powerful 670 kW (900 hp) Shvetsov M-63 engine. The Type 29 replaced two of the ShKAS guns with a single 12.7 mm (.50 in) UBS. Ten Type 17 fighters were supplied to the Chinese Air Force where on 20 May 1940, they effectively shot down a C5M scout-attack plane and three G3M bombers during the Battle of Chongqing.

Types 18, 24, 27, 28, and 29 could be fitted to carry RS-82 unguided rockets. The first successful use of air-to-air missiles in air combat was on August 20, 1939. A Ki-27 was hit by an RS-82 rocket launched from a distance of about a kilometer. The shot was fired by Captain N. Zvonarev.

A 1939 government study found the I-16 had exhausted its performance potential. The addition of armor, radio, battery, and flaps during the aircraft&#x27;s evolution exacerbated the rear weight distribution problems to the point where the aircraft required considerable forward pressure on the stick to maintain level flight and at the same time developed a tendency to enter uncontrolled dives. Extension and retraction of the landing flaps caused a dramatic change in the aircraft&#x27;s attitude. Accurate gunfire was difficult.

===Soviet Union===

The pilots nicknamed the aircraft &quot;Ishak&quot; (Russian: &quot;Ишак&quot;, &quot;Donkey&quot;/&quot;Hinny&quot;) because it was similar to the Russian pronunciation of &quot;I-16&quot; (&quot;ee-shestnadtset&quot;). When Operation Barbarossa erupted on 22 June 1941, 1,635 of 4,226 VVS aircraft were I-16s of all variants, fielded by 57 fighter regiments in frontier areas. The main assault delivered by the Luftwaffe&#x27;s &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2 (in support of Wehrmacht Army Group Centre) was directed against the Soviet Western Special Military District, that deployed 361 (424 according to other sources) I-16s. During the early phase of the campaign the I-16 bases were the main targets for the German aircraft and after 48 hours of combat, of the 1,635 Polikarpov monoplanes in service on 21 June 1941, only 937 were left. By 30 June the number of I-16s in western front line units had dropped to 873, including 99 that required repairs. To stem the Luftwaffe aerial assault several I-16 pilots adopted the &quot;taran&quot; tactic and sacrificed their lives, ramming German aircraft.

Its main opponent in the sky in 1941 was the German Messerschmitt Bf 109. The I-16 was slightly more maneuverable than the early Bf 109s and could fight the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, or &quot;Emil&quot;, on equal terms in turns. Skilled Soviet pilots took advantage of the Polikarpov&#x27;s superior horizontal maneuverability and liked it enough to resist the switch to more modern fighters. The German aircraft, however, outclassed its Soviet opponent in service ceiling, rate of climb, acceleration and, crucially, in horizontal and diving speed, due to better aerodynamics and a more powerful engine. The main versions of the I-16 had a maximum speed of 450–470 km/h (279–291 mph), while the Bf 109E had a maximum speed of 560–570 km/h (347–353 mph), the more streamlined Bf 109F &quot;Friedrich&quot; could hit 615–630 km/h (372-390plus mph). So German pilots held the initiative and could decide if they wanted to chase their opponents, could attack them from above and behind and then gain altitude for a new attack. Meanwhile, Polikarpovs could only defend each other by forming a defensive circle or via horizontal maneuverability.

Moreover, in terms of armament, Messerschmitts had a slight edge on the I-16. The &quot;Emil&quot; carried two wing-mounted 20mm MG FF cannons and two synchronized 7.92 mm MG-17s with a weight of a one-second salvo of 2.37 kg, while the most common version of the I-16—armed with just two synchronized and two wing-mounted 7.62 ShKAS—could deliver 1.43 kg of bullets each second. Finally, the ammunition storage on a Messerschmitt exceeded that of the I-16, carrying 1,000 rounds for each machine gun (plus sixty drum-housed rounds for each cannon), while the Polikarpov carried just 450 rounds for each ShKAS gun.

Around half of all produced I-16s were still in service in 1943, when they were finally replaced.

Specially modified I-16s were used in the Zveno parasite aircraft experiments using the Tupolev TB-3 as a mothership. These I-16s carried two 250 kg bombs for dive bombing. This was more than double the bomb load an I-16 could take off with under its own power. Once the bombs were dropped, they could perform as normal I-16s, and could re-attach to the TB-3 for the return journey.

The Luftwaffe was known to have captured some I-16 and UTI-4 two-seat trainers (two of which were marked with the &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; codes DM+HC and DM+HD) and flown from the &quot;Erprobungstelle Rechlin&quot; central Luftwaffe test facility by Kampfgeschwader 200 (KG 200). The Luftwaffe was not the only air force able to test its fighters against the I-16; the Japanese captured a few I-16s as well, and the Romanian Air Force also got one when a Soviet pilot defected. The Finnish Air Force (FAF) captured some I-16s (along with several other Soviet types). During the Winter War and the Continuation War, the Finns captured six I-16s and one I-16UTI. Two of the captured I-16s and I-16UTIs were put back into flying condition and flight tested.

==Surviving aircraft==
Commencing in 1993, New Zealand pilot and entrepreneur Sir Tim Wallis&#x27; Alpine Fighter Collection organised the restoration of six I-16s and three I-153s, found in Russia, to an airworthy condition by the Soviet Aeronautical Research Institute (Sibnia) in Novosibirsk. The flight of the first restored aircraft (I-16 &quot;9&quot;) took place in October 1995. Once restored the aircraft were transported by rail to Vladivostok and from there shipped via Hong Kong to New Zealand. This project was completed in 1999 when the third and final I-153 arrived in New Zealand. In addition a seventh I-16 was later restored for American collector Jerry Yagen.
