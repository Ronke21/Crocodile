<text>The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers is an underground comic about a fictional trio of stoner characters, created by the American artist Gilbert Shelton. The Freak Brothers first appeared in &quot;The Rag&quot;, an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968, and were regularly reprinted in underground publications around the United States and in other parts of the world. Later their adventures were published in a series of comic books.

The lives of the Freak Brothers revolve around the procurement and enjoyment of recreational drugs, particularly marijuana. The comics present a critique of the establishment while satirizing the counterculture.

Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat appears in many of the stories, spinning off his own cartoon strip (which appeared as part of the Freak Brothers comic page, in the manner of older comic strip double features) and later some full-length episodes.

An animated TV series adaptation, &quot;The Freak Brothers&quot;, was released on Tubi on November 14, 2021.

== Publication history ==

The Freak Brothers first appeared in &quot;The Rag&quot;, an underground newspaper published in Austin, Texas, beginning in May 1968. Their debut was in an advertising flyer for a winter 1968 film short called &quot;The Texas Hippies March on the Capitol&quot;. Freak Brothers strips soon became popular and, thanks to the Underground Press Syndicate, were regularly reprinted in underground papers around the United States and in other parts of the world.

The Freak Brothers&#x27; first comic book appearance was in &quot;Feds &#x27;n&#x27; Heads&quot;, self-published by Shelton in the spring of 1968 (and later re-issued in multiple printings by Berkeley&#x27;s the Print Mint). They also appeared in the first two issues of Jay Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot;. In 1969 Shelton and three friends from Texas founded Rip Off Press in San Francisco, which took over publication of all subsequent Freak Brothers comics. The first compilation of their adventures, &quot;The Collected Adventures of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot;, had its first printing in 1971 and has been continually in print ever since. 

A weekly &quot;Freak Brothers&quot; comic strip was syndicated by Rip Off Press to underground and student publications in the 1970s, along with the related strip &quot;Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat&quot;. In addition to those strips, new adventures appeared in magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;High Times&quot;, and &quot;Rip Off Comix&quot;; these too were collected in comic book form. Shelton continued to write and draw the series until 1992, in collaboration with Dave Sheridan (1974 – 1982) and Paul Mavrides (1978 – 1992).

The majority of the comic books consist of one or more multi-page stories together with a number of one-page strips; many of the latter have a one-row skit featuring Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat at the bottom of the page. Issues #8-10 contained only the long-form story &quot;The Idiots Abroad&quot;, which &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; listed as #44 of the &quot;100 Greatest Comics of the Century.&quot; The UK newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; said of a 2003 reprint of the story that, &quot;The graphic quality is, even in slightly muddy reproduction, astonishing. Depictions of various European cities recall Hergé in their accuracy and detail ... As for the subject matter, considering the dates of composition, it has hardly dated.&quot;

== Characters ==
The Freak Brothers are not siblings. They are a threesome of freaks (similar to, but distinct from, hippies) from San Francisco.

* Freewheelin&#x27; Franklin Freek, although laid-back, is the most street-smart of the trio. Apparently he has always been on the streets and it appears that he is several years older than the others. In one story he reveals that he grew up in an orphanage and never knew his parents. Tall and skinny, he has a big bulbous nose, a waterfall mustache and a ponytail. He wears cowboy boots and a cowboy hat. In one strip, he runs into an ex-girlfriend who has a child that bears a striking resemblance to him. He does his best to evade them and is relieved when she does not recognize him. In another strip, when he meets his own (possible) father, the same plot is inverted. Depending on the level of colorization used in the strip in question, Franklin&#x27;s hair is red, blonde, or light brown.

* Phineas T. Phreak is the intellectual and idealist of the group. He has enough mastery of chemistry to create new drugs and takes an avid interest in politics. Of the three, he is the most committed to social change and environmental issues. He is from Texas and while his mother is relaxed and open-minded, his father is a card-carrying member of the John Birch Society. He is the hairiest of the brothers—tall and skinny with a thick bush of black hair, a beard, a nose bearing more than a passing resemblance to a joint, and glasses. He is the stereotypical left-wing radical, bearing a superficial resemblance to Abbie Hoffman or Jerry Rubin.

* Fat Freddy Freekowtski is the least intelligent of the trio and is most likely to be preoccupied with food. He is moderately overweight, with curly yellow hair and a mustache. His compulsion to eat is the subject of several of the adventures of the group. Fat Freddy frequently gets &quot;burned&quot; during drug transactions; when he does &quot;score&quot; he typically manages to lose the drugs in various ways, such as by dumping them out of a shopping bag in front of a cooling fan, which then blows them out the window onto a police car. Fat Freddy comes from an unexceptional large family in Cleveland. In &quot;The Idiots Abroad&quot;, Freddy visits the Polish village of Gfatsk, where everybody happens to look like him. He is driven away by an angry mob as soon as they hear the name Freekowtski.

Other recurring characters include:

* Dealer McDope, one of the trio&#x27;s dealers. He is often mentioned in the strips but rarely appears in person. The character was initially created by Dave Sheridan for the Rip Off Press title &quot;Mother&#x27;s Oats Comix&quot;.
* Hiram &quot;Country&quot; Cowfreak, a hippy who grows vast quantities of marijuana at his isolated farmstead. He is referred to as the Freak Brothers&#x27; &quot;cousin&quot;.
* Norbert the Nark, an inept DEA agent who is continually trying, and failing, to arrest the Freak Brothers.
* Tricky Prickears, the star of a comic book within the comic that the Freak Brothers enjoy reading. He is billed as &quot;The Freak Brothers&#x27; favorite law enforcement officer&quot;. Tricky is a blind, deaf and reactionary detective and the character is a parody of Dick Tracy, to the extent that Shelton drew his stories in a different style, resembling that of Tracy&#x27;s creator Chester Gould.
* Governor Rodney Richpigge, a stereotypically rich, corrupt politician whom the Freak Brothers hold in general contempt. The governor&#x27;s son is a cocaine dealer.
== Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat ==

Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat is a fictional orange Tabby cat, nominally belonging to Fat Freddy.

While the Cat is usually featured in a small &#x27;topper&#x27; strip below a Freak Brothers strip, he has had independent appearances and storylines of his own. His two running jokes are Fat Freddy is too lazy to name him, and he suffers neglect and abuse from the Brothers&#x27; lifestyle.

Single line segments appeared in student newspapers in Australia in the 1970s.

Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat first appeared in 1969 in underground newspapers as a character in &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; strip. He soon gained his own small spin-off topper strip, in imitation of the early &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; strips below &quot;The Family Upstairs&quot; by George Herriman. Some full-size stories also featured Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat.

Many of these strips have been collected in comic book form by Rip Off Press in a series of &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; compilations and later &quot;The Adventures of Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat&quot;, which ran for four small size issues in the 1970s. &quot;Fat Freddy&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; (one-shot, 1983) also included several stories about the Cat.

&quot;The Adventures of Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat&quot; were reprinted and expanded (starting over from #1) in six comic book size issues in the 1980s. They included new longer stories about the Cat. A seventh edition was released (in the US only) in 1993. After the demise of the underground newspaper, the Cat continued to appear in various comic books. His last appearance to date was in a 1990 strip reprinted in &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; #12.

The Cat is much smarter than Freddy, and while sharing many of his preoccupations such as drugs, food, sleep and sex, his stories also feature a fair amount of defecation. Like Garfield (whom he predates) he is laid back, but in his personal habits and outlook he is more like the Freak Brothers. However he tends to regard the Freak Brothers with amused contempt, frequently expressed by defecating in inappropriate and inconvenient places, such as stereo headphones.

Like Calvin of &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; he has a fertile imagination. He is apt to tell tall stories to his three &quot;nephews&quot;. One storyline features him playing the role of &quot;F. Frederick Skitty&quot;, an undercover agent sworn to stop the distribution of &quot;Tee Hee Hee&quot;, a drug that turns people into homosexuals. Another story involves a scheme by Fat Freddy to replicate Dick Whittington&#x27;s success and sell the Cat to the (fictional) small, oil-rich nation of Pootweet to deal with mice.

The New Zealand band Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, whose debut album won the 2005 Gilles Peterson Worldwide Winners Award, were named after the comic. The band&#x27;s debut single was recorded under the influence of LSD that had been printed with blotter art of Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat, and the band liked the name.

The popular 8-bit computer game &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot; has a room named &quot;We Must Perform a Quirkafleeg&quot; in honour of this strip.

Fat Freddy&#x27;s Restaurant in Galway, Ireland, described as &quot;Galway&#x27;s favourite restaurant&quot;, is extensively decked out with arcana and other memorabilia relating to the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers and Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat.

The science fiction novel &quot;Scam Artists of the Galaxy&quot; (2020) contains a location named Fat Freddy&#x27;s Restaurant with a supercilious mostly orange cat. This novel&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Election Matters: Life on Universityworld&quot; (2022), sees the cat and one of its kittens appear.

Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat is voiced by Tiffany Haddish in the animated series &quot;The Freak Brothers&quot;, which debuted in 2020, and is commonly called Kitty by Fat Freddy. This version of the character is female and is capable of conversing directly with the Freaks whom she once again has a habit of insulting and belittling. She can apparently handle weed much better than them, though this did not prevent her from having the ultimate high that sent them from 1969 to 2020.

== Storylines and themes ==
Drug use is the predominant theme that runs throughout all volumes of this title. The protagonists &quot;live in a state of blissful torpor relieved only by bursts of paranoia or stimulant-induced frenzy.&quot; Marijuana is the most frequently mentioned, but numerous other stimulants and hallucinogens are mentioned as well. Heroin is usually missing from the list. In one adventure, Franklin is shown to turn down an offer of &quot;smack&quot; when hitching a ride.

Food is a recurring subject. These stories most often involve Fat Freddy and his marijuana-induced &quot;munchies&quot; (increased appetite). The squalor engendered by the Brothers&#x27; indolence is often highlighted; several strips feature the household&#x27;s cockroach population, ruled over by a fascist monarchy. Several stories satirize governments, particularly the U.S. government. These stories invariably show politicians and their agents as corrupt, incompetent, or both. The theme of foreign travel is sometimes explored, most notably in the three-part &quot;Idiots Abroad&quot; series.

It is common for the storylines to begin with an air of realism, but rapidly descend into comic pantomime.

Classic Freak Brothers stories include:
* &quot;Grass Roots&quot;: The Brothers find a year&#x27;s supply of cocaine and move to the country with the proceeds. They snort it all in two days. The Brothers are joined by a trio of hippie women who join them in their misadventures: the dilapidated farmhouse, Freddy&#x27;s run in with a hillbilly moonshiner, the rumor of gold on the property, and Phineas running for sheriff.
* &quot;Chariot of the Globs&quot;: Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat is abducted by aliens.
*&quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers in the 21st Century:&quot; The Brothers experience life in the future.
*&quot;Knock &#x27;em Dead:&quot; The Brothers form a punk band.
* &quot;The 7th Voyage of the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers: A Mexican Odyssey&quot;: The Brothers holiday in Mexico, are thrown in jail and escape with the help of shaman Don Longjuan, in an oblique parody of the Carlos Castaneda books.
* &quot;The Idiots Abroad&quot;: The Brothers are split up attempting to travel to Colombia hoping to score cheap dope down there, yet none of them manages to reach Bogotá; Fat Freddy accidentally joins a group of nuclear terrorists in Scotland before disrupting the International Workers&#x27; Day military parade in Moscow, USSR and being subsequently sold to slavery in Africa; Franklin is almost killed by a native apocalyptic South American cult before joining a group of pirates; while Phineas ends up in Mecca and becomes the world&#x27;s richest man after founding a new religion.

== Film and TV adaptations ==

In 1978, the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers appeared in the full-length pornographic film &quot;Up in Flames&quot;. The story involves the brothers&#x27; attempts to raise cash to make their rent deadline (the trio being in danger of being evicted from their apartment). Fat Freddy gains employment at a local food store run by graphic artist Robert Crumb&#x27;s character Mr. Natural.

In 1979, Universal Studios paid Shelton and Rip Off Press $250,000 for the rights to make a live-action &quot;Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; film. Shelton received the bulk of the money, which enabled him to live part-time in Europe. Meanwhile, the Universal-produced &quot;Freak Brothers&quot; film never made it to the production stage.

In 2006, the company Grass Roots Films began production on a feature-length clay animation film based on the series, called &quot;Grass Roots&quot;, co-produced by German distribution company X Filme. In 2013, work on the film stopped.

An animated television series adaptation titled &quot;The Freak Brothers&quot;, based on the characters and set in modern San Francisco, was released on Tubi on November 14, 2021. The series was preceded on May 6, 2020, by a mini-episode titled &quot;Kentucky Fried Freaks&quot;. The series features Woody Harrelson, Pete Davidson, John Goodman, and Tiffany Haddish as voice actors for the three Freaks and the cat respectively. Courtney Solomon and Mark Canton serve as executive producers, with Jeffrey Scott Edell serving as Co-Executive Producer, alongside Adam DeVine and Blake Anderson who also provide voice acting. The series is animated by Pure Imagination Studios and Starburns Industries studio, which also worked on &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. In May 2022, the series was renewed for a second season. The series will be released on digital on April 17, 2023 by Lionsgate.

== In popular culture ==
Fat Freddy&#x27;s Drop, formed in the late 1990s, is a Wellington, New Zealand, band that took its name from the &quot;Freak Brothers&quot; comics. According to the band, individual doses of a certain type of LSD popular in Wellington at that time had the image of Fat Freddy&#x27;s Cat printed on it. Dropping — common slang for taking LSD — Fat Freddies became the inspiration for the band&#x27;s name.

Director Paul Thomas Anderson said the look of Joaquin Phoenix&#x27;s lead character, Larry &quot;Doc&quot; Sportello, in Anderson&#x27;s 2014 adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, was based in part on Freewheelin&#x27; Franklin Freek:
=== Sports ===

=== Science ===
At the Le Havre Normandy University, Claire Bowen analysed the timeless appeal and current relevance of the Freak Brothers comics in the American couter culture of the 1970s Chiara Polli at the University of Messina conducted semiotic studies of a selection of Italian translations of the Freak Brothers Comics, using isotopies as a key tool in the analysis of comics in translation.

<doc id="177169" wikidata="Q931179" url="?curid=177169" title="Lamma Island">
<text>Lamma Island, also known as Y Island, Pok Liu Chau or simply Pok Liu, is the third largest island in Hong Kong. Administratively, it is part of the Islands District.
Lamma Island is a rural area.

==Name==
The island was named Lamma because of a chart reading error by Alexander Dalrymple in the 1760s. He acquired a Portuguese chart of the entrance to the Pearl River. Close to the west of the island, the Portuguese owner had written &quot;Lama&quot;. Dalrymple misinterpreted that as the name of the island. However, it was a Portuguese note describing the consistency of the seabed for the sake of anchoring there. The Portuguese word &quot;lama&quot; refers to mud.
In early charts the name was spelled with only one &quot;m&quot;. The island acquired a British name by error. The name was acculturated phonetically in characters, &quot;Lam a&quot; can mean &quot;south fork&quot; in Cantonese, with the original muddle being all but forgotten. At some point, things became further obscured by the addition of the second &quot;m&quot; in the English spelling.

In ancient times, Lamma used to be named as Pok Liu or Pok Liu Chau.

==Geography==
Lamma Island is located to the southwest of Hong Kong Island. It is the third largest island of Hong Kong, with an area of and a length of . The northern village is called Yung Shue Wan (Banyan Tree Bay) and the eastern village is called Sok Kwu Wan (Rainbow Bay, literally Cable Fishing Net Bay). Few people live on the southern part of Lamma. Access for much of this part is by hiking or private boat. Beaches along Lamma&#x27;s south-facing edge include Yung Shue Ha Beach and Sham Wan.

Mount Stenhouse (, Shan Tei Tong) is the tallest mountain in Lamma at above sea level, situated between Sok Kwu Wan and Sham Wan. Unusually shaped rocks can be found all over this mountain, but a grueling hike is necessary to access these.

==History==
According to archaeological findings, human settlement on the northern and eastern part of Lamma Island can be traced back to around 4000–3000 BC, the Middle Neolithic and Bronze Ages. Yung Shue Ha, one of Lamma&#x27;s earliest villages, was settled in the early 19th century by a clan from China&#x27;s Bao&#x27;an County.

==Demographics==

Lamma has an estimated population of 5,900 people as of 2014. However, with future developments such as a planned beach community in Sok Kwu Wan the population capacity is expected to double to 11,000 residents.

Actor Chow Yun-fat () grew up on the island in the village of Wang Long near Yung Shue Wan. His relatives used to operate a seafood/pigeon restaurant called &quot;Shau Kee&quot; in the main village.

Lamma has a significant Western and international population. As of 2021 , the island is 55% Chinese , ethnic minorities include white (23%) and Filipino (11.4%). 

The island has a reputation for alternative lifestyles and has a relaxed atmosphere. Lamma is being urbanised and property prices are increasing as a result of the attraction of this lifestyle. 

==Description==
In contrast to Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, Lamma is peaceful and tranquil with an abundance of natural scenery. Buildings higher than three storeys are prohibited and there are no automobiles but diminutive fire trucks and ambulances, as well as village vehicles; distinctive open-back vehicles to transport construction materials. The community&#x27;s only means of transport is either by foot or bicycle.

Lamma provides an alternative to the hectic life in the city. Property and rents are cheap compared with those of central Hong Kong. These factors have attracted a significant expatriate community to Lamma Island. It is also popular with younger people and a haven for artists and musicians.

==Yung Shue Wan==

Yung Shue Wan (Banyan Bay) is the most populated area on Lamma Island. Several decades ago, it was the centre of the plastics industry. The factories have now been replaced by seafood restaurants, pubs, grocery stores and shops which sell oriental and Indian-style handicraft. Hung Shing Yeh Beach, Lamma Power Station, North Lamma Island Public Library and Lamma Winds are also located in the northern part of the island.

==Sok Kwu Wan==

The big street of Sok Kwu Wan consists mainly of seafood restaurants. Sok Kwu Wan has the largest fish farming site in Hong Kong. Tourists can barbecue and fish at Lo So Shing Beach which is a ten-minute walk from the village. The trail between Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan is surrounded by grassland and offers a picturesque walk. From there one can see a nice portion of the coastline of the island. It takes roughly an hour to walk the trail.

Walkers may notice a few &#x27;caves&#x27; on the trail near Sok Kwu Wan, labelled on tourist signs as &#x27;kamikaze grottos&#x27;. These caves were dug out by the Japanese during the war, to store munitions alongside the suicide boats. When the British Navy reclaimed Hong Kong, they discovered rows of speedboats with explosives rigged to the bow in Sok Kwu Wan.

In addition to the caves, the Japanese also dug tunnels into the island&#x27;s peaks, including two known tunnels on Ling Kok Shan and one on Mt. Stenhouse.

==Sham Wan==

Sham Wan is one of the five most important archaeological sites in Hong Kong. The bay is the site of an important Bronze Age settlement which was unearthed by archaeologists in the 1970s. It yielded evidence of people living on Lamma during the &quot;Middle Neolithic&quot; phase (c. 3800–3000 BC).

Historically Sham Wan was also a place for green sea turtles to lay eggs. The endangered green turtles are a special group of marine organisms with distinctive navigation behaviour between their nesting, breeding, development and reproduction sites. As Sham Wan is the only existing nesting site for them in Hong Kong, every year there is a period of restricted access to it from 1 June to 31 October to allow the turtles to breed. The breeding site is about . The last known nesting at Sham Wan was in 2012.

==Traditional festivals==
Tin Hau temples are typical places of worship in Hong Kong&#x27;s coastal communities because Tin Hau is believed to be the goddess of the sea and of fishermen, protecting them and ensuring full nets. There are three Tin Hau temples on Lamma, located in Yung Shue Wan, Sok Kwu Wan, and Luk Chau Village.

The Tin Hau Festival (twenty-third of the third month of the Lunar Calendar) is widely celebrated by the fishermen&#x27;s communities in Lamma. Cantonese opera and floral paper offerings known as &quot;Fa Pau&quot; at both Sok Kwu Wan and Yung Shue Wan are the highlights of the celebration.

Lamma Island is also one of the few remaining places in Hong Kong where traditional Chinese New Year celebrations still take place: at the stroke of midnight, fireworks will be set off by the main families of the villages to frighten away the evil spirits, sending off a deafening thunder that can last up to 30 minutes.

==Transportation==
There are regular ferry services to Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan from Central on Hong Kong Island, as well as to Yung Shue Wan via Pak Kok, and to Sok Kwu Wan via Mo Tat Wan, from Aberdeen. It takes about 25 minutes by ferry between Yung Shue Wan and Central. There are no cars on Lamma Island.

Two ferries collided off Yung Shue Wan on 1 October 2012 at 8:20 pm local time. With 39 killed and 92 injured, the incident was the deadliest maritime disaster in Hong Kong since 1971.

As the island is not connected by road to the rest of Hong Kong, the only vehicles on the island are those used by the emergency services, and village vehicles, which are used to transport goods. The main method of getting around the island is on foot or by bicycle.

==Education==
Lamma Island is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 96, which contains a single aided school, Northern Lamma School; no government primary schools are in this net.

<doc id="177171" wikidata="Q321282" url="?curid=177171" title="Earl Mountbatten of Burma">
<text>Earl Mountbatten of Burma is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, created in 1947 for Rear Admiral Louis Mountbatten, who in 1946 had been created the first Viscount Mountbatten of Burma. He was later promoted to Admiral of the Fleet.

The family seat is Newhouse Manor, near Ashford, Kent.

==Creation==
The Earldom was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 28 October 1947 for Rear Admiral Louis Mountbatten, 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma.

The subsidiary titles of the earldom are Viscount Mountbatten of Burma, of Romsey in the County of Southampton (created earlier in 1946), and Baron Romsey, of Romsey in the County of Southampton (created together with the Earldom in 1947). All these peerages are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and have the same special remainder (see below). 

&quot;Lord Romsey&quot; was the courtesy title by which Lady Mountbatten&#x27;s eldest son and heir was known until in 2005 he succeeded his father John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne as Baron Brabourne, of Brabourne in the County of Kent. Subsequently, with the death of his mother on 13 June 2017, he became the 3rd Earl Mountbatten of Burma. As a consequence, both the Brabourne peerage and the Knatchbull Baronetcy, of Mersham Hatch, in the Baronetage of England (created in 1641 for Sir Norton Knatchbull) became subsidiary titles to the Earldom. 

&quot;Lord Brabourne&quot; is now the courtesy title by which Lord Mountbatten&#x27;s eldest son is known.

==Special remainder==
When elevated to the peerage, the first Earl had no son, and the letters patent creating the peerages granted to him were all subject to the following special remainder, in the absence of heirs male:

&quot;...to his eldest daughter Patricia Edwina Victoria, Baroness Brabourne...and the heirs male of her body lawfully begotten; and in default of such issue to every other daughter lawfully begotten of the said Louis Francis Albert Victor Nicholas... successively in order of seniority of age and priority of birth and to the heirs male of their bodies lawfully begotten...&quot;

As a result, since the first Lord Mountbatten never had a son, his elder daughter, Patricia, succeeded as the 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma upon her father&#x27;s death. Should the legitimate male line of descent of the 2nd Countess become extinct, the peerages would be inherited by her sister, Lady Pamela Hicks, and her legitimate heirs male. (But there are ten living male-line descendants of the 2nd Countess, as of 2024.) Should the legitimate male lines of both sisters fail, the peerages would become extinct.

While the male-line heirs of Lady Pamela Hicks are in the line of succession to the earldom, they are not in line of succession to the Barony of Brabourne. Should the 7th Baron Brabourne&#x27;s line become extinct, that peerage would revert to a male-line descendant of the 1st Baron Brabourne&#x27;s 3rd son.
==Earls Mountbatten of Burma (1947)==

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s only son, Nicholas Louis Charles Norton Knatchbull, Lord Brabourne (born 1981).

<text>The Orion Nebula (also known as Messier 42, M42, or NGC 1976) is a diffuse nebula in the Milky Way situated south of Orion&#x27;s Belt in the constellation of Orion, and is known as the middle &quot;star&quot; in the &quot;sword&quot; of Orion. It is one of the brightest nebulae and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky with an apparent magnitude of 4.0. It is away and is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. M42 is estimated to be 25 light-years across (so its apparent size from Earth is approximately 1 degree). It has a mass of about 2,000 times that of the Sun. Older texts frequently refer to the Orion Nebula as the Great Nebula in Orion or the Great Orion Nebula.

The Orion Nebula is one of the most scrutinized and photographed objects in the night sky and is among the most intensely studied celestial features. The nebula has revealed much about the process of how stars and planetary systems are formed from collapsing clouds of gas and dust. Astronomers have directly observed protoplanetary disks and brown dwarfs within the nebula, intense and turbulent motions of the gas, and the photo-ionizing effects of massive nearby stars in the nebula.

== Physical characteristics ==

The Orion Nebula is visible with the naked eye even from areas affected by light pollution. It is seen as the middle &quot;star&quot; in the &quot;sword&quot; of Orion, which are the three stars located south of Orion&#x27;s Belt. The &quot;star&quot; appears fuzzy to sharp-eyed observers, and the nebulosity is obvious through binoculars or a small telescope. The peak surface brightness of the central region of M42 is about 17 Mag/arcsec2 and the outer bluish glow has a peak surface brightness of 21.3 Mag/arcsec2.

The Orion Nebula contains a very young open cluster, known as the Trapezium Cluster due to the asterism of its primary four stars within a diameter of 1.5 light years. Two of these can be resolved into their component binary systems on nights with good seeing, giving a total of six stars. The stars of the Trapezium Cluster, along with many other stars, are still in their early years. The Trapezium Cluster is a component of the much larger Orion Nebula cluster, an association of about 2,800 stars within a diameter of 20 light years. The Orion Nebula is in turn surrounded by the much larger Orion molecular cloud complex, which is hundreds of light years across, spanning the whole Orion Constellation. Two million years ago the Orion Nebula cluster may have been the home of the runaway stars AE Aurigae, 53 Arietis, and Mu Columbae, which are currently moving away from the nebula at speeds greater than .

=== Coloration ===
Observers have long noted a distinctive greenish tint to the nebula, in addition to regions of red and of blue-violet. The red hue is a result of the Hα recombination line radiation at a wavelength of 656.3 nm. The blue-violet coloration is the reflected radiation from the massive O-class stars at the core of the nebula.

The green hue was a puzzle for astronomers in the early part of the 20th century because none of the known spectral lines at that time could explain it. There was some speculation that the lines were caused by a new element, and the name nebulium was coined for this mysterious material. With better understanding of atomic physics, however, it was later determined that the green spectrum was caused by a low-probability electron transition in doubly ionized oxygen, a so-called &quot;forbidden transition&quot;. This radiation was impossible to reproduce in the laboratory at the time, because it depended on the and nearly collision-free environment found in the high vacuum of deep space.

==History==

There has been speculation that the Mayans of Central America may have described the nebula within their &quot;Three Hearthstones&quot; creation myth; if so, the three would correspond to two stars at the base of Orion, Rigel and Saiph, and another, Alnitak at the southern (left) tip of the &quot;hunter&#x27;s belt&quot;, which together form the vertices of a nearly perfect equilateral triangle, the same shape as traditional Mayan hearths. Near the center of the triangle is Orion&#x27;s Sword (including the Orion Nebula), which ancient Mayan mythology regarded as the literal or figurative embers of a fiery creation smoldering at the center of the hearth. Similarly, modern Lacandon Maya regard it as smoke from copal incense.

Neither Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; nor al Sufi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot; noted this nebula, even though they both listed patches of nebulosity elsewhere in the night sky; nor did Galileo mention it, even though he also made telescopic observations surrounding it in 1610 and 1617. This has led to some speculation that a flare-up of the illuminating stars may have increased the brightness of the nebula.

The first discovery of the diffuse nebulous nature of the Orion Nebula is generally credited to French astronomer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, on November 26, 1610, when he recorded observing it with a refracting telescope purchased by his patron Guillaume du Vair.

The first published observation of the nebula was by the Jesuit mathematician and astronomer Johann Baptist Cysat of Lucerne in his 1619 monograph on the comets (describing observations of the nebula that may date back to 1611).
 He made comparisons between it and a bright comet seen in 1618, describing how the nebula appeared through his telescope:

His description of the center stars as different from a comet&#x27;s head in that they were a &quot;rectangle&quot; may have been an early description of the Trapezium Cluster. (The first detection of three of the four stars of this cluster is credited to Galileo Galilei on February 4, 1617.

The nebula was independently &quot;discovered&quot; (though visible to the naked eye) by several other prominent astronomers in the following years, including by Giovanni Battista Hodierna (whose sketch was the first published in &quot;De systemate orbis cometici, deque admirandis coeli characteribus&quot;). In 1659, Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens published the first detailed drawing of the central region of the nebula in &quot;Systema Saturnium&quot;.

Charles Messier observed the nebula on March 4, 1769, and he also noted three of the stars in Trapezium. Messier published the first edition of his catalog of deep sky objects in 1774 (completed in 1771). As the Orion Nebula was the 42nd object in his list, it became identified as M42.


In 1865, English amateur astronomer William Huggins used his visual spectroscopy method to examine the nebula, showing that it, like other nebulae he had examined, was made up of &quot;luminous gas&quot;. On September 30, 1880, Henry Draper used the new dry plate photographic process with an refracting telescope to make a 51-minute exposure of the Orion Nebula, the first instance of astrophotography of a nebula in history. Another breakthrough in astronomical photography occurred in 1883, when amateur astronomer Andrew Ainslie Common used the dry plate process to record several images in exposures up to 60 minutes with a reflecting telescope that he constructed in the backyard of his home in Ealing, west London. These images, for the first time, showed stars and nebula detail too faint to be seen by the human eye.

In 1902, Vogel and Eberhard discovered differing velocities within the nebula, and by 1914 astronomers at Marseille had used the interferometer to detect rotation and irregular motions. Campbell and Moore confirmed these results using the spectrograph, demonstrating turbulence within the nebula.

In 1931, Robert J. Trumpler noted that the fainter stars near the Trapezium formed a cluster, and he was the first to name them the &quot;Trapezium Cluster&quot;. Based on their magnitudes and spectral types, he derived a distance estimate of 1,800 light years. This was three times farther than the commonly accepted distance estimate of the period but was much closer to the modern value.

In 1993, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) first observed the Orion Nebula. Since then, the nebula has been a frequent target for HST studies. The images have been used to build a detailed model of the nebula in three dimensions. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around most of the newly formed stars in the nebula, and the destructive effects of high levels of ultraviolet energy from the most massive stars have been studied.

In 2005, the &quot;Advanced Camera for Surveys&quot; instrument of the Hubble Space Telescope finished capturing the most detailed image of the nebula yet taken. The image was taken through 104 orbits of the telescope, capturing over 3,000 stars down to the 23rd magnitude, including infant brown dwarfs and possible brown dwarf binary stars. A year later, scientists working with the HST announced the first ever masses of a pair of eclipsing binary brown dwarfs, 2MASS J05352184–0546085. The pair are located in the Orion Nebula and have approximate masses of and respectively, with an orbital period of 9.8 days. Surprisingly, the more massive of the two also turned out to be the less luminous.

In October 2023, astronomers, based on observations of the Orion Nebula with the James Webb Space Telescope, reported the discovery of &quot;pairs&quot; of rogue planets, similar in mass to the planet Jupiter, and called JuMBOs (Jupiter Mass Binary Objects).

==Structure==
The entirety of the Orion Nebula extends across a 1° region of the sky, and includes neutral clouds of gas and dust, associations of stars, ionized volumes of gas, and reflection nebulae.

The Orion Nebula is part of a much larger nebula known as the Orion molecular cloud complex, which extends throughout the constellation of Orion and includes Barnard&#x27;s Loop, the Horsehead Nebula, M43, M78, and the Flame Nebula. Stars are forming throughout the entire Cloud Complex, but most of the young stars are concentrated in dense clusters like the one illuminating the Orion Nebula.


The current astronomical model for the nebula consists of an ionized (H II) region, roughly centered on Theta1 Orionis C, which lies on the side of an elongated molecular cloud in a cavity formed by the massive young stars. 
(Theta1 Orionis C emits 3-4 times as much photoionizing light as the next brightest star, Theta2 Orionis A.) The H II region has a temperature ranging up to 10,000 K, but this temperature falls dramatically near the edge of the nebula. The nebulous emission comes primarily from photoionized gas on the back surface of the cavity. 
The H II region is surrounded by an irregular, concave bay of more neutral, high-density cloud, with clumps of neutral gas lying outside the bay area. This in turn lies on the perimeter of the Orion molecular cloud. The gas in the molecular cloud displays a range of velocities and turbulence, particularly around the core region. Relative movements are up to , with local variations of up to 50 km/s and possibly more.

Observers have given names to various features in the Orion Nebula. The dark bay that extends from the north into the bright region is known as &quot;Sinus Magnus&quot;, also called the &quot;Fish&#x27;s Mouth&quot;. The illuminated regions to both sides are called the &quot;Wings&quot;. Other features include &quot;The Sword&quot;, &quot;The Thrust&quot;, and &quot;The Sail&quot;.

==Star formation==

The Orion Nebula is an example of a stellar nursery where new stars are being born. Observations of the nebula have revealed approximately 700 stars in various stages of formation within the nebula.

In 1979 observations with the Lallemand electronic camera at the Pic-du-Midi Observatory showed six unresolved high-ionization sources near the Trapezium Cluster. These sources were interpreted as partly ionized globules (PIGs). The idea was that these objects are being ionized from the outside by M42. Later observations with the Very Large Array showed solar-system-sized condensations associated with these sources. Here the idea appeared that these objects might be low-mass stars surrounded by an evaporating protostellar accretion disk. In 1993 observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have yielded the major confirmation of protoplanetary disks within the Orion Nebula, which have been dubbed &quot;proplyds&quot;. HST has revealed more than 150 of these within the nebula, and they are considered to be systems in the earliest stages of solar system formation. The sheer number of them have been used as evidence that the formation of planetary systems is fairly common in the universe.

Stars form when clumps of hydrogen and other gases in an H II region contract under their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme temperatures by converting gravitational potential energy to thermal energy. If the temperature gets high enough, nuclear fusion will ignite and form a protostar. The protostar is &#x27;born&#x27; when it begins to emit enough radiative energy to balance out its gravity and halt gravitational collapse.

Typically, a cloud of material remains a substantial distance from the star before the fusion reaction ignites. This remnant cloud is the protostar&#x27;s protoplanetary disk, where planets may form. Recent infrared observations show that protoplanetary disks in the Orion Nebula contain dust grains that are growing, beginning the process of forming planetesimals.

Once the protostar enters into its main sequence phase, it is classified as a star. Even though most planetary disks can form planets, observations show that intense stellar radiation should have destroyed any proplyds that formed near the Trapezium group, if the group is as old as the low mass stars in the cluster. Since proplyds are found very close to the Trapezium group, it can be argued that those stars are much younger than the rest of the cluster members.

===Stellar wind and effects===
Once formed, the stars within the nebula emit a stream of charged particles known as a stellar wind. Massive stars and young stars have much stronger stellar winds than the Sun. The wind forms shock waves or hydrodynamical instabilities when it encounters the gas in the nebula, which then shapes the gas clouds. The shock waves from stellar wind also play a large part in stellar formation by compacting the gas clouds, creating density inhomogeneities that lead to gravitational collapse of the cloud.

There are three different kinds of shocks in the Orion Nebula. Many are featured in Herbig–Haro objects:
* Bow shocks are stationary and are formed when two particle streams collide with each other. They are present near the hottest stars in the nebula where the stellar wind speed is estimated to be thousands of kilometers per second and in the outer parts of the nebula where the speeds are tens of kilometers per second. Bow shocks can also form at the front end of stellar jets when the jet hits interstellar particles.
* Jet-driven shocks are formed from jets of material sprouting off newborn T Tauri stars. These narrow streams are traveling at hundreds of kilometers per second and become shocks when they encounter relatively stationary gases.
* Warped shocks appear bow-like to an observer. They are produced when a jet-driven shock encounters gas moving in a cross-current.
* The interaction of the stellar wind with the surrounding cloud also forms &quot;waves&quot; which are believed to be due to the hydrodynamical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

The dynamic gas motions in M42 are complex, but are trending out through the opening in the bay and toward the Earth. The large neutral area behind the ionized region is currently contracting under its own gravity.

There are also supersonic &#x27;bullets&#x27; of gas piercing the hydrogen clouds of the Orion Nebula. Each bullet is ten times the diameter of Pluto&#x27;s orbit and tipped with iron atoms glowing in the infrared. They were probably formed one thousand years earlier from an unknown violent event.

==Evolution==

Interstellar clouds like the Orion Nebula are found throughout galaxies such as the Milky Way. They begin as gravitationally bound blobs of cold, neutral hydrogen, intermixed with traces of other elements. The cloud can contain hundreds of thousands of solar masses and extend for hundreds of light years. The tiny force of gravity that could compel the cloud to collapse is counterbalanced by the very faint pressure of the gas in the cloud.

Whether due to collisions with a spiral arm, or through the shock wave emitted from supernovae, the atoms are precipitated into heavier molecules and the result is a molecular cloud. This presages the formation of stars within the cloud, usually thought to be within a period of 10–30 million years, as regions pass the Jeans mass and the destabilized volumes collapse into disks. The disk concentrates at the core to form a star, which may be surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. This is the current stage of evolution of the nebula, with additional stars still forming from the collapsing molecular cloud. The youngest and brightest stars we now see in the Orion Nebula are thought to be less than 300,000 years old, and the brightest may be only 10,000 years in age. Some of these collapsing stars can be particularly massive and can emit large quantities of ionizing ultraviolet radiation. An example of this is seen with the Trapezium Cluster. Over time the ultraviolet light from the massive stars at the center of the nebula will push away the surrounding gas and dust in a process called photoevaporation. This process is responsible for creating the interior cavity of the nebula, allowing the stars at the core to be viewed from Earth. The largest of these stars have short life spans and will evolve to become supernovae.

Within about 100,000 years, most of the gas and dust will be ejected. The remains will form a young open cluster: a cluster of bright, young stars surrounded by wispy filaments from the former cloud.

<text>The Sunda Strait () is the strait between the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra. It connects the Java Sea with the Indian Ocean.

==Etymology==
The strait takes its name from the Sunda Kingdom, which ruled the western portion of Java (an area covering the present day West Java, Jakarta, Banten, and some of western Central Java) from 669 to around 1579.

The name also alludes to the Sundanese people native to West Java and Banten.

==Geography==

Extending in a roughly southwest/northeast orientation, with a minimum width of at its northeastern end between Cape Tua on Sumatra and Cape Pujat on Java, the strait is part of the Java Sea. It is essentially triangular in shape, with two large bays on its northern side. It is also very broad and deep at its southwestern end, but as it narrows to the northeast it becomes much shallower, with a minimum depth of only in parts of its northeastern end.

The strait is notoriously difficult to navigate because of this shallowness, very strong tidal currents, sandbanks, and man-made obstructions such as oil platforms off the Java coast.

For centuries, the strait was an important shipping route, especially during the period when the Dutch East India Company used it as the gateway to the Spice Islands of Indonesia (1602–1799). However, its narrowness, shallowness, and lack of accurate charting make it unsuitable for many modern, large ships, most of which use the Strait of Malacca instead.

The strait is dotted with a number of islands, many of which are volcanic in origin. They include: Sangiang (Thwart-the-Way), Sebesi, Sebuku, and Panaitan (Prince&#x27;s). The 1883 eruption of Krakatau, one of these islands, had a profound effect on the area, both short and long term. Tsunamis and pyroclastic flows which floated on clouds of steam killed tens of thousands. Out of 3,000 people on nearby Sebesi at the time, not one survived. Some land was never resettled and became Ujung Kulon National Park.

The Krakatoa eruption drastically altered the topography of the strait, with as much as 18–21 km3 of ignimbrite being deposited over an area of 1.1 million km2 around the volcano. However, the population has recovered and much of the coastline is now very densely populated. Aside from Krakatoa&#x27;s sole remaining peak, Rakata, the Krakatoa Archipelago consists of the islands of Lang (Panjang or Rakata Kecil), Verlaten (Sertung), and most recently, Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the original Krakatoa&#x27;s shattered remains.

==Battle of Sunda Strait==
On March 1, 1942, the Battle of Sunda Strait—part of the larger Battle of the Java Sea—took place when the Allied cruisers HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; and USS &quot;Houston&quot; encountered a Japanese amphibious landing force near Bantam, commanded by Rear Admiral Kenzaburo Hara. That force included a light cruiser and eleven destroyers, four heavy cruisers and a light aircraft carrier. The two Allied cruisers were sunk, while a Japanese minesweeper and a transport vessel were sunk by friendly fire.

==Planned bridge==
In the 1960s proposals were made for a bridge across the Sunda Strait, and in the 1990s further suggestions arose. A new plan was announced in October 2007. It would use the islands of Ular, Sangiang and Prajurit to create a four-part suspension bridge reaching above sea level. This bridge would have a maximum span of 3 kilometers, around 50% longer than the current record holder, the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge. Construction was projected to begin in 2014 if funding of at least US$10 billion could be secured.

An accord was signed in April 2012 with China Railway Construction Corporation for an $11 billion road and double track rail bridge. However, in November 2014 the incoming government of President Joko Widodo shelved plans to build the bridge.

<text>Hoagland Howard &quot;Hoagy&quot; Carmichael (November 22, 1899 – December 27, 1981) was an American musician, composer, songwriter, actor, author and lawyer. Carmichael was one of the most successful Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the 1930s and 1940s, and was among the first singer-songwriters in the age of mass media to utilize new communication technologies such as old-time radio broadcasts, television, microphones, and sound recordings (musical records).

Carmichael composed several hundred songs, including 50 that achieved hit record status. He is best known for composing four of the most-recorded American songs of all time: &quot;Stardust&quot; (1927), with lyrics by Mitchell Parish, &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; (1930), with lyrics by Stuart Gorrell, &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; (1937), with lyrics by Ned Washington, and &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; (1938), with lyrics by Frank Loesser.

He also collaborated with famed lyricist-songwriter Johnny Mercer (1909-1976), on &quot;Lazybones&quot; (1933), and later &quot;Skylark&quot; (1941). Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Ole Buttermilk Sky&quot; of 1946, was an Academy Award nominee for an &quot;Oscar&quot; in the following year of March 1947, with the eponymous theme song from the Western film &quot;Canyon Passage&quot; (1946), starring Dana Andrews, Brian Donlevy, Susan Hayward and Ward Bond, in which he co-starred as a ukulele and guitar-playing balladeer musician and prospector-miner riding a mule.

Four years later, &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,&quot; with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1951. Carmichael also appeared as a character actor and musical performer in 14 other films, hosted three musical-variety radio programs, performed on television, and wrote two autobiographies/memoirs.

== Early life and education ==
Hoagland Howard (&quot;Hoagy&quot;) Carmichael was born in Bloomington (Monroe County), in central Indiana, on November 22, 1899. He was the first child and only son of Howard Clyde and Lida Mary (Robison) Carmichael. His parents named him after a circus troupe called the &quot;Hoaglands&quot; that had stayed at the Carmichael house during his mother&#x27;s pregnancy. Howard worked as a horse-drawn taxi driver and later as an electrician, while Lida, a versatile pianist, played musical accompaniment at local nickelodeons and silent movie theaters and private parties to earn extra income. Hoagy had two younger sisters, Georgia and Joanne.

Because of Howard&#x27;s unstable job history, the family moved frequently. Hoagy lived most of his early years in Bloomington, the county seat of surrounding Monroe County, Indiana. Bloomington was also a college town (for the main campus of Indiana University) and the nearby 
state capital town of Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1910, the Carmichaels moved far northwest to Missoula, Montana, when young Hoagland was about 11 years old.

Carmichael&#x27;s mother taught him to sing and play the piano at an early age. With the exception of some piano lessons in nearby Indianapolis with Reginald DuValle (1893-1953), a bandleader, pianist and accordion-player, known later as &quot;the elder statesman of Indiana jazz&quot; and billed as &quot;the Rhythm King&quot;, Carmichael had no other academic or professional musical training.

The family moved back east to Indianapolis when Carmichael was age 17 in 1916, but Carmichael only followed and returned to Bloomington three years later in 1919 when he was age 20 to complete high school. For musical inspiration, Carmichael would listen to prominent ragtime music pianists Hank Wells and Hube Hanna. At 18, Carmichael helped supplement his family&#x27;s meager income by doing manual jobs in building construction, or at a bicycle chain factory, and in a meat slaughterhouse. This bleak time was partially relieved by piano duets with his mother and by his long friendship with local musician-bandleader DuValle, who taught him piano-jazz improvisation. Carmichael earned $5 playing at a college fraternity dance at nearby Indiana University in 1918, marking the beginning of his professional musical career.

The death of Carmichael&#x27;s three-year-old younger sister in 1918 (possibly from the world-wide infamous Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1923) affected him deeply. He later wrote &quot;My sister Joanne—the victim of poverty. We couldn&#x27;t afford a good doctor or good attention, and that&#x27;s when I vowed I would never be broke again in my lifetime.&quot;

Carmichael attended the nearby campus of the Indiana University at Bloomington, where he earned a bachelor of arts academic degree in 1925 and a subsequent law degree in 1926. He was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, and played the piano around Indiana and Ohio with his recently organized band, &quot;Carmichael&#x27;s Collegians&quot;.

Around 1922, Carmichael first met Leon (&quot;Bix&quot;) Beiderbecke (1903-1931), a cornetist and sometime pianist from Iowa. The two became friends and played music together. Around 1923, during a visit to Chicago, Beiderbecke introduced Carmichael to fellow musician trumpeter Louis Armstrong (1901-1971), with whom Carmichael would later collaborate, while Armstrong was playing with Chicago-based King Oliver (1881-1938)&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band. Armstrong would continue to influence Carmichael&#x27;s compositions; Carmichael reflected in a letter to his wife in the early 1930s that he was going to see Armstrong to learn about the &quot;purty notes.&quot; Under Beiderbecke&#x27;s influence, Carmichael began playing the cornet but found his lips unsuited to the mouthpiece and soon stopped. He was also inspired by Beiderbecke&#x27;s impressionistic and classical music ideas and influences from the master composers of previous centuries.

Carmichael&#x27;s first recorded song, initially titled &quot;Free Wheeling,&quot; was written for Beiderbecke, whose band, The Wolverines, recorded it as &quot;Riverboat Shuffle&quot; in 1924 for Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana. The song became a jazz staple. (Mitchell Parish&#x27;s lyrics were added in 1939.) Carmichael&#x27;s other early musical compositions included &quot;Washboard Blues&quot; and &quot;Boneyard Shuffle,&quot; which Curtis Hitch and his band, &quot;Hitch&#x27;s Happy Harmonists&quot;, recorded at the Gennett Records studio in Richmond. The band&#x27;s instrumental rendition of &quot;Washboard Blues,&quot; recorded on May 19, 1925, was the earliest recording in which Carmichael performed his own songs, including an improvised piano solo.

After graduating from IU&#x27;s law school in 1926, Carmichael moved to Florida, where he worked as a legal clerk in a West Palm Beach legal firm, but he returned to Indiana in 1927 after failing the Florida bar exam. He joined an Indianapolis law firm (Bingham, Mendenhall and Bingham) and passed the Indiana bar, but devoted most of his energies to music. Carmichael had discovered his method of songwriting, which he described later: &quot;You don&#x27;t write melodies, you find them…If you find the beginning of a good song, and if your fingers do not stray, the melody should come out of hiding in a short time.&quot;

== Career ==
Carmichael composed several hundred songs, including fifty that achieved hit-record status during his long career. In his early days as a songwriter in Indiana (1924–1929), he wrote and performed in the hot jazz improvisational style, popular with jazz dance bands. While he was living in New York City (1929–1936), he wrote songs that were intended to stand alone, independent of any other production, such as a theatrical performance or a motion picture. Carmichael&#x27;s songs from this period continued to include jazz influences. During his later years in California (1936–1981), his songs were predominately instrumentals. Nearly four dozen were written expressly for, or were incorporated into, motion pictures.

Carmichael made hundreds of recordings between 1925 and his death in 1981. He also appeared on radio and television and in motion pictures and live performances, where he demonstrated his versatility. Because Carmichael lacked the vocal strength to sing without amplification on stage, as well as the unusual tone of his voice, which he described as &quot;flatsy through the nose,&quot; he took advantage of new electrical technologies, especially the microphone, sound amplification, and advances in recording. As a singer-pianist, Carmichael was adept at selling his songs to lyricists, music publishers, film producers, and promoting them to the public via microphones on stage and in mass media.

=== Early years ===
On October 31, 1927, Carmichael recorded &quot;Star Dust,&quot; one of his most famous songs, at the Gennett Records studio in Richmond, Indiana, playing the piano solo himself. Carmichael recruited Frank Trumbauer and Bix Beiderbecke, along with members of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra that included the Dorsey brothers, to play at the late October recording session with him; it is not known which of the orchestra&#x27;s musicians were at the October 31 session when &quot;Star Dust&quot; was initially recorded. New York&#x27;s Mills Music published the song as an upbeat piano solo in January 1929 and renamed it &quot;Stardust.&quot; (Mills Music republished the song with the addition of Mitchell Parish&#x27;s lyrics in May 1929.) &quot;Stardust&quot; attracted little attention until 1930, when Isham Jones and his orchestra recorded it as a sentimental ballad with a slower tempo, the re-timing often credited to the band&#x27;s arranger, Victor Young. It became a hit song, the first of many for Carmichael. Its idiosyncratic melody in medium tempo–a song about a song–later became a standard of the Great American Songbook, recorded by hundreds of artists, including Artie Shaw, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Willie Nelson, and Wynton Marsalis.

Carmichael received more recognition after Paul Whiteman and his orchestra recorded &quot;Washboard Blues&quot; on Victor Records in Chicago in November 1927, with Carmichael singing and playing the piano. Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;March of the Hoodlums&quot; and Sheldon Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Dog&quot; were produced from Carmichael&#x27;s last recording session at the Gennett Records studio on May 2, 1928, with a band he had hand-selected.

In 1929, after realizing that he preferred making music and had no aptitude for or interest in becoming a lawyer (he was sacked from his job at the law firm), Carmichael moved to New York City, where he worked for a brokerage firm during the weekdays and spent his evenings composing music, including some songs for Hollywood musicals. In New York, Carmichael met Duke Ellington&#x27;s agent and sheet music publisher, Irving Mills, and hired him to set up recording dates. Carmichael&#x27;s first major song with his own lyrics was &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair,&quot; recorded by Louis Armstrong and Mildred Bailey, and eventually with his own hand-picked studio band (featuring Beiderbecke, Bubber Miley, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Bud Freeman, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, and Gene Krupa) on May 21, 1930.

=== 1930s ===
After the October 1929 stock market crash, Carmichael&#x27;s hard-earned savings declined substantially. Fortunately, Louis Armstrong had recorded &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot; at Okeh studios in 1929, giving Carmichael a badly needed financial and career boost. The song became one of Carmichael&#x27;s jazz standards. Carmichael composed and recorded &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; (lyrics by Stuart Gorrell) in 1930. The song became another jazz staple, as well as a pop standard, especially after World War II. Carmichael also arranged and recorded &quot;Up a Lazy River&quot; in 1930, a tune by Sidney Arodin. Although Carmichael and the band he assembled had first recorded &quot;Stardust&quot; as an instrumental in 1927, Bing Crosby recorded the tune with Mitchell Parish&#x27;s lyrics in 1931.

Carmichael joined ASCAP in 1931. The following year he began working as a songwriter for Ralph Peer&#x27;s Southern Music Company, the first music firm to occupy the new Brill Building, which became a famous New York songwriting mecca. The Great Depression rapidly put an end to the jazz scene of the Roaring Twenties. People were no longer attending clubs or buying music, forcing many musicians out of work. Carmichael was fortunate to retain his low-paying but stable job as a songwriter with Southern Music. Beiderbecke&#x27;s early death in 1931 also darkened Carmichael&#x27;s mood. Of that time, he wrote later: &quot;I was tiring of jazz and I could see that other musicians were tiring as well. The boys were losing their enthusiasm for the hot stuff…. No more hot licks, no more thrills.&quot;

Carmichael&#x27;s eulogy for &quot;hot&quot; jazz, however, was premature. Big band swing was just around the corner, and jazz soon turned in another direction with new bandleaders, such as Benny Goodman, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, and new singers, such as Bing Crosby, leading the way. Carmichael&#x27;s output followed the changing trend. In 1933 he began a long-lasting collaboration with lyricist Johnny Mercer, newly arrived in New York, on &quot;Lazybones,&quot; which became a hit. Southern Music published the sheet music in 1933; more than 350,000 copies were sold in three months. Carmichael collaborated with Mercer on nearly three dozen songs, including &quot;Thanksgiving,&quot; &quot;Moon Country,&quot; and the 1951 Academy Award-winner for best song, &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool, of the Evening.&quot;

Carmichael also began to emerge as a solo singer-performer, first at parties, then professionally. He described his unique, laconic voice as sounding &quot;the way a shaggy dog looks... I have Wabash fog and sycamore twigs in my throat.&quot; Some fans were dismayed as he steadily veered away from &quot;hot&quot; jazz, but Armstrong&#x27;s recordings continued to &quot;jazz up&quot; Carmichael&#x27;s popular songs. In 1935 Carmichael left Southern Music Company and began composing songs for a division of Warner Brothers, establishing his connection with Hollywood. &quot;Moonburn,&quot; the first song Carmichael wrote for a motion picture, was sung by Bing Crosby in Paramount Pictures’ film &quot;Anything Goes&quot; in 1936.

Following his marriage to Ruth Mary Meinardi, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister, on March 14, 1936, the couple moved to California, where Carmichael hoped to find more work in the film industry. In 1937, the year before the birth of the couple&#x27;s first son, Hoaglund Jr. (Hoagy Bix), Carmichael accepted a contract with Paramount Pictures for $1,000 a week, joining other songwriters working for the Hollywood studios, including Harry Warren at Warner Brothers, E. Y. Harburg at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin at Paramount.

Carmichael found work as a character actor in Hollywood. His on-screen debut occurred in 1937 in &quot;Topper&quot;, with Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. Carmichael portrayed a piano player and performed his song &quot;Old Man Moon&quot; in the film. The effort led to other character actor roles in the 1940s.

Carmichael also continued to write individual songs. His song &quot;Chimes of Indiana&quot; was presented to Indiana University, Carmichael&#x27;s alma mater, in 1937 as a gift from the class of 1935. In 1938, Carmichael collaborated with Paramount lyricist Frank Loesser on &quot;Heart and Soul,&quot; &quot;Two Sleepy People,&quot; and &quot;Small Fry.&quot; &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; was included in Paramount&#x27;s motion picture &quot;A Song Is Born&quot; (1938), performed by Larry Clinton and his orchestra. (After 1950, a simpler version became a popular piano duet among American children.) Dick Powell premiered Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes)&quot; in a national radio broadcast in 1938.

&quot;Little Old Lady,&quot; included in &quot;The Show Is On&quot; (1936), was Carmichael&#x27;s first song to appear in a Broadway musical and became a hit, but Carmichael&#x27;s score for the Broadway production &quot;Walk with Music&quot;, which he did with Mercer, was unsuccessful. The musical opened in 1940 and ran for only three weeks, producing no hit songs. Carmichael never attempted another musical, resuming his career as a singer-songwriter and character actor in Hollywood.

=== 1940s ===

The growing Carmichael family, which included Hoagy, Ruth, and their sons, Hoagy Bix (born in 1938) and Randy Bob (born in 1940), moved into the former mansion of chewing-gum heir William P. Wrigley, Jr. in Los Angeles in 1942, when the United States entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. His contribution to the war effort was similar to other patriotic efforts by Irving Berlin (&quot;This Is the Army, Mr. Jones&quot;), Johnny Mercer (&quot;G.I. Jive&quot;), and Frank Loesser (&quot;Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition&quot;). Carmichael&#x27;s wartime songs (most with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) included &quot;My Christmas Song for You,&quot; &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Say &#x27;No&#x27; Baby,&quot; &quot;Billy-a-Dick,&quot; &quot;The Army of Hippocrates,&quot; &quot;Cranky Old Yank,&quot; &quot;Eager Beaver,&quot; &quot;No More Toujours l&#x27;Amour,&quot; &quot;Morning Glory,&quot; and the never-completed &quot;Hitler Blues.&quot;

Throughout the 1940s Carmichael maintained a strong personal and professional relationship with Mercer. In later 1941 their continuing collaboration led to &quot;Skylark,&quot; considered one of Carmichael&#x27;s greatest songs. Bing Crosby recorded it almost immediately in January 1942. Since then many others have recorded the song, including Glenn Miller, Dinah Shore, Helen Forrest (with Harry James), Aretha Franklin and Bette Midler.

Carmichael&#x27;s 1942 song &quot;I&#x27;m a Cranky Old Yank&quot; was listed in the 1967 edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; under the title &quot;I&#x27;m a Cranky Old Yank in a Clanky Old Tank on the Streets of Yokohama with My Honolulu Mama Doin&#x27; Those Beat-o, Beat-o Flat-On-My-Seat-o, Hirohito Blues&quot; as the longest song title.

Carmichael appeared as an actor in 14 motion pictures, performing at least one of his songs in each. He described his on-screen persona as the &quot;hound-dog-faced old musical philosopher noodling on the honky-tonk piano, saying to a tart with a heart of gold: &#x27;He&#x27;ll be back, honey. He&#x27;s all man.&#x27;&quot; In 1944 Carmichael played Cricket in the screen adaptation of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot;, opposite Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. He sang &quot;Hong Kong Blues&quot; and &quot;The Rhumba Jumps,&quot; and played piano as Bacall sang &quot;How Little We Know.&quot; In the multi-Academy Award-winning film &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946) with Dana Andrews, Myrna Loy and Fredric March, Carmichael&#x27;s character teaches a disabled veteran with metal prostheses to play &quot;Chopsticks,&quot; and also performs &quot;Lazy River.&quot; Carmichael played Hi Linnett in &quot;Canyon Passage&quot; (1946), a Universal Pictures western that starred Dana Andrews (his costar in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; and &quot;Night Song&quot;), Susan Hayward, and Brian Donlevy. He also composed several songs for the film, including &quot;Ole Buttermilk Sky,&quot; an Academy Award nominee.

Carmichael&#x27;s career as a recording artist peaked in the mid-1940s when he recorded exclusively for Decca Records and V-Disc (the Armed Forces label for service personnel overseas), acted and performed in motion pictures, and hosted variety shows on the radio. He also sang in live shows across the United States, and debuted in the United Kingdom at the London Casino in 1948. According to his son Randy, Carmichael was an incessant composer, working on a song for days or even weeks until it was perfect. His perfectionism extended to his clothes, grooming, and eating. Once the work was done, however, Carmichael would cut loose—relax, play golf, drink, and indulge in the Hollywood high life. Carmichael also found time to write his first autobiography, &quot;The Stardust Road&quot;, published in 1946. In addition, Carmichael composed an orchestral work, &quot;Brown County in Autumn&quot;, in 1948, but it was not well received by critics.

Between 1944 and 1948, Carmichael became a well-known radio personality and hosted three musical-variety programs. In 1944–45, the 30-minute &quot;Tonight at Hoagy&#x27;s&quot; aired on Mutual radio on Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. (Pacific time), sponsored by Safeway supermarkets. Produced by Walter Snow, the show featured Carmichael as host and vocalist. Musicians included Pee Wee Hunt and Joe Venuti. Fans were rather blunt about Carmichael&#x27;s singing, providing comments such as &quot;you cannot sing for your soul&quot; and &quot;your singing is so delightfully awful that it is really funny.&quot;

=== 1950s ===
During the 1950s, the public&#x27;s musical preferences shifted toward rhythm and blues and rock and roll, ending the careers of most older artists. Carmichael&#x27;s songwriting career also slowed down, but he continued to perform.

In the early 1950s, variety shows were particularly popular on television. Carmichael&#x27;s most notable appearance was as the host of &quot;Saturday Night Review&quot; in June 1953, a summer replacement series for &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;. He was also a regular cast member in the first season of NBC&#x27;s western TV series &quot;Laramie&quot; (1959–63), playing the character role of Jonesy the ranch hand.

As his songwriting career started to fade, Carmichael&#x27;s marriage also dissolved. He and his wife Ruth divorced in 1955.

The &quot;Johnny Appleseed Suite&quot;, Carmichael&#x27;s second classical work for orchestra, suffered the same ill fate as his earlier attempt, &quot;Brown County Autumn&quot;. The suite received little notice and only limited success, but Carmichael remained financially secure due to the royalties from his past hits. During the 1940s and 1950s Carmichael also wrote more than a dozen songs for children, including &quot;The Whale Song,&quot; &quot;Merry-Go-Round,&quot; and &quot;Rocket Ship.&quot;

=== Later years ===
Ray Charles&#x27;s classic rendition of &quot;Georgia on My Mind,&quot; released on August 19, 1960, was a major hit. (Charles received Grammys both for Best Male Vocal and Best Popular Single that year.) In 1961, Carmichael was featured in an episode of &quot;The Flintstones&quot; entitled &quot;The Hit Songwriters.&quot; Jerry Lee Lewis recorded &quot;Hong Kong Blues&quot; during his final Sun sessions in 1963, but it was never released. In 1964, while the Beatles were exploding on the scene, Carmichael lamented, &quot;I&#x27;ll betcha I have 25 songs lying in my trunk&quot; and no one was calling to say &quot;have you got a real good song for such-and such an artist.&quot; (Beatles guitarist George Harrison released covers of &quot;Baltimore Oriole&quot; and &quot;Hong Kong Blues&quot; in early 1981.) Royalties on his standards were earning Carmichael over $300,000 a year.

Carmichael&#x27;s second memoir, &quot;Sometimes I Wonder: The Story of Hoagy Carmichael&quot;, was published in 1965. By 1967 he was spending time in New York, but his new songs were unsuccessful and his musical career came to a close. Carmichael took up other interests in retirement, including golf, coin collecting, and enjoying his two homes, one on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles and the other in Rancho Mirage, California.

As he passed his 70th birthday, Carmichael&#x27;s star continued to wane and was nearly forgotten in a world dominated by rock music. With the help and encouragement of his son, Hoagy Bix Carmichael, Carmichael participated in the PBS television show &quot;Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s Music Shop&quot;, which featured jazz-rock versions of his hits by Stark Reality. He appeared on Fred Rogers&#x27;s PBS show &quot;Old Friends, New Friends&quot; in 1978. With more time on his hands, Carmichael resumed painting, and after a long courtship he married Dorothy Wanda McKay, an actress, in 1977.

Carmichael received several honors from the music industry in his later years. He was inducted into the USA&#x27;s Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971, along with Duke Ellington. In 1972, Indiana University awarded Carmichael an honorary doctorate in music. On June 27, 1979, the Newport Jazz Festival honored Carmichael&#x27;s 80th birthday with a concert titled &quot;The Stardust Road: A Hoagy Carmichael Jubilee&quot; in Carnegie Hall. The tribute concert was hosted by former bandleader Bob Crosby and included performances by many major musical performers, such as singers Kay Starr, Jackie Cain, Dave Frishberg, and Max Morath, and musicians Billy Butterfield, Bob Wilber, Yank Lawson, Vic Dickenson, and Bob Haggart. National Public Radio broadcast the concert later that summer. &quot;Piano Pedal Rag,&quot; a new Carmichael tune, was performed during the concert. Carmichael told host Crosby that he wrote it because he admired Beiderbecke&#x27;s writing &quot;so much that I didn&#x27;t want to stop until I wrote something that was a little bit like something Bix might have liked.&quot;

On his 80th birthday, Carmichael was reflective, observing, &quot;I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in myself. I know I could have accomplished a hell of a lot more... I could write anything any time I wanted to. But I let other things get in the way... I&#x27;ve been floating around in the breeze.&quot; He spent his final years at home in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, California, where he continued to play golf and remained an avid coin collector.

Shortly before his death in 1981, Carmichael appeared on a United Kingdom-recorded tribute album, &quot;In Hoagland&quot; (1981), with Annie Ross and Georgie Fame. Carmichael sang and played &quot;Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot; on the piano. His last public appearance occurred in early 1981, when he filmed &quot;Country Comes Home&quot; with country music performer Crystal Gayle for CBS.

===Political views===
According to his biographer, Carmichael had supported the Republican Party since his youth, and did so throughout his life. He voted for Wendell Willkie at the 1940 presidential election, and backed Barry Goldwater, the party&#x27;s candidate, at the 1964 United States presidential election.

== Later life and death ==
Carmichael married Wanda McKay in 1977. He died of a heart attack at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, on December 27, 1981, at age 82. His remains are buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington, Indiana.

==Legacy==

Carmichael is considered to be among the most successful of the Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the 1930s, and he was among the first singer-songwriters in the age of mass media to exploit new communication technologies, such as television and the use of electronic microphones and sound recordings. Carmichael was an industry trailblazer who recorded varied interpretations of his own songs and provided material for many other musicians to interpret. His creative work includes several hundred compositions, some of them enduring classics, as well as numerous sound recordings and appearances on radio and television and in motion pictures.

Music historian Ivan Raykoff described Carmichael as &quot;one of America&#x27;s most prolific songwriters&quot; and an &quot;iconic pianist&quot; whose work appeared in more than a dozen Hollywood films, including his performances in classic films such as &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;. Among the hundreds of Carmichael&#x27;s published songs, &quot;Stardust&quot; is one of the most frequently recorded. Carmichael&#x27;s greatest strength was as a melodist, but he also became known as an &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot; songwriter, whose &quot;catchy, often jazz-infused, melodies&quot; and &quot;nostalgic, down-home lyrics&quot; were memorable and had wide public appeal, especially with mass media promotion and through the efforts of numerous entertainers who performed his songs.

In 1986, Carmichael&#x27;s family donated his archives, piano, and memorabilia to his alma mater, Indiana University, which established a Hoagy Carmichael Collection in its Archives of Traditional Music and the Hoagy Carmichael Room to permanently display selections from the collection.

== Honors and tributes ==
Carmichael and lyricist Johnny Mercer received an Academy Award for Best Music, Song, for &quot;In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,&quot; which was featured in the 1951 film &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot;. &quot;Ole Buttermilk Sky&quot; received an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Song, of 1946, but it was not the winner. Carmichael&#x27;s recording of &quot;Star Dust&quot; in 1927 at the Gennett Records studio that includes him playing the piano solo was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In addition, it was selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2004.

Carmichael was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960. (His sidewalk star tribute is located at 1720 Vine Street in Hollywood.) In 1971 Carmichael was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame as one of its initial ten inductees. In 2007 Carmichael was inducted into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana. Bronze and ceramic medallions, one for each of the inductees, have been placed near the location of the Starr Piano Company&#x27;s manufacturing complex.

Carmichael is memorialized with an Indiana state historical marker, installed in 2007 in front of the former Book Nook (one of Carmichael&#x27;s favorite local hangouts) on South Indiana Avenue, near the corner of Kirkwood and Indiana Streets in Bloomington. The marker is located across the street from the heart of the Indiana University campus. In 2008, the bronze Hoagy Carmichael Landmark Sculpture by artist Michael McAuley was installed at the northeast corner of the IU Auditorium on IU&#x27;s Bloomington campus.

On June 27, 1979, the Newport Jazz Festival honored Carmichael with a tribute concert, &quot;The Star Dust Road: A Hoagy Carmichael Jubilee,&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Carnegie Hall.

&quot;Georgia On My Mind,&quot; composed by Carmichael with lyrics by Stuart Gorrell, is the U.S. state of Georgia&#x27;s official song.

Carmichael also appeared as a Stone Age version of himself in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, in which he sings &quot;The Yabba Dabba Doo Song,&quot; written by Barney, and based on an idea from Fred. Fred, Barney, Wilma, and Betty also contribute to the lyrics.

=== In popular culture ===
In Ian Fleming&#x27;s first James Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, both Bond&#x27;s fellow secret agent René Mathis and his love interest Vesper Lynd remark that Bond looks like Hoagy Carmichael. Later in the novel, after looking at his reflection in a mirror, Bond disagrees. Ian Fleming repeated the comparison to Carmichael in his third James Bond novel, &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

<text>The Daily Mail is a British daily middle-market tabloid newspaper published in London. It was founded in 1896. , it has the highest circulation of paid newspapers in the UK. Its sister paper &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; was launched in 1982, a Scottish edition was launched in 1947, and an Irish edition in 2006. Content from the paper appears on the MailOnline news website, although the website is managed separately and has its own editor.

The paper is owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust. Jonathan Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere, a great-grandson of one of the original co-founders, is the chairman and controlling shareholder of the Daily Mail and General Trust, while day-to-day editorial decisions for the newspaper are usually made by a team led by the editor. Ted Verity succeeded Geordie Greig as editor on 17 November 2021.

A survey in 2014 found the average age of its readers was 58, and it had the lowest demographic for 15- to 44-year-olds among the major British dailies. Uniquely for a British daily newspaper, women make up the majority (52–55%) of its readership. It had an average daily circulation of 1.13 million copies in February 2020. Between April 2019 and March 2020 it had an average daily readership of approximately 2.18 million, of whom approximately 1.41 million were in the ABC1 demographic and 0.77 million in the C2DE demographic. Its website had more than 218 million unique visitors per month in 2020.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; has won several awards, including receiving the &quot;National Newspaper of the Year&quot; award from The Press Awards nine times since 1994 (). The Society of Editors selected it as the &#x27;Daily Newspaper of the Year&#x27; for 2020. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; has been criticised for its unreliability, its printing of sensationalist and inaccurate scare stories about science and medical research, and for instances of plagiarism and copyright infringement. In February 2017, the English Wikipedia banned the use of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a reliable source.

==Overview==
The &quot;Mail&quot; was originally a broadsheet but switched to a compact format on 3 May 1971, the 75th anniversary of its founding. On this date it also absorbed the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, which had been published as a tabloid by the same company. The publisher of the &quot;Mail&quot;, the Daily Mail and General Trust (DMGT), is listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Circulation figures according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations in February 2020 show gross daily sales of 1,134,184 for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. According to a December 2004 survey, 53% of &quot;Daily Mail&quot; readers voted for the Conservative Party, compared to 21% for Labour and 17% for the Liberal Democrats. The main concern of Viscount Rothermere, the current chairman and main shareholder, is that the circulation be maintained. He testified before a House of Lords select committee that &quot;we need to allow editors the freedom to edit&quot;, and therefore the newspaper&#x27;s editor was free to decide editorial policy, including its political allegiance. On 17 November 2021, Ted Verity began a new seven-day role as editor of &quot;Mail&quot; newspapers, with responsibility for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; and &quot;You&quot; magazine.

==History==
===Early history===

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, devised by Alfred Harmsworth (later Viscount Northcliffe) and his brother Harold (later Viscount Rothermere), was first published on 4 May 1896. It was an immediate success. It cost a halfpenny at a time when other London dailies cost one penny, and was more populist in tone and more concise in its coverage than its rivals. The planned issue was 100,000 copies, but the print run on the first day was 397,215, and additional printing facilities had to be acquired to sustain a circulation that rose to 500,000 in 1899. Lord Salisbury, 19th-century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, dismissed the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as &quot;a newspaper produced by office boys for office boys.&quot; By 1902, at the end of the Boer Wars, the circulation was over a million, making it the largest in the world.

With Harold running the business side of the operation and Alfred as editor, the &quot;Mail&quot; from the start adopted an imperialist political stance, taking a patriotic line in the Second Boer War, leading to claims that it was not reporting the issues of the day objectively. The &quot;Mail&quot; also set out to entertain its readers with human interest stories, serials, features and competitions. It was the first newspaper to recognise the potential market of the female reader with a women&#x27;s interest section and hired one of the first female war correspondents Sarah Wilson who reported during the Second Boer War.

In 1900, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; began printing simultaneously in both Manchester and London, the first national newspaper to do so (in 1899, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had organised special trains to bring the London-printed papers north). The same production method was adopted in 1909 by the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;, in 1927 by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and eventually by virtually all the other national newspapers. Printing of the &quot;Scottish Daily Mail&quot; was switched from Edinburgh to the Deansgate plant in Manchester in 1968 and, for a while, &quot;The People&quot; was also printed on the &quot;Mail&quot; presses in Deansgate. In 1987, printing at Deansgate ended, and the northern editions were thereafter printed at other Associated Newspapers plants.

For a time in the early 20th century, the paper championed vigorously against the &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, warning of the alleged dangers said to be posted by Chinese immigration to the United Kingdom. The &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; theme came to be abandoned because the Anglo-German naval race led to a more plausible threat to the British empire to be presented. In common with other Conservative papers, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; used the Anglo-German naval race as a way of criticising the Liberal governments that were in power from 1906 onward, claiming that the Liberals were too pusillanimous in their response to the Tirpitz plan.

In 1906, the paper offered £10,000 for the first flight from London to Manchester, followed by a £1,000 prize for the first flight across the English Channel. &quot;Punch&quot; magazine thought the idea preposterous and offered £10,000 for the first flight to Mars, but by 1910 both the &quot;Mail&quot;s prizes had been won. The paper continued to award prizes for aviation sporadically until 1930. Virginia Woolf criticised the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as an unreliable newspaper, citing the statement published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in July 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion that &quot;every one of the Europeans was put to the sword in a most atrocious manner&quot; as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; maintained that the entire European community in Beijing had been massacred. A month later in August 1900 the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published a story about the relief of the western Legations in Beijing, where the westerners in Beijing together with the thousands of Chinese Christians had been under siege by the Boxers.

Before the outbreak of the First World War, the paper was accused of warmongering when it reported that Germany was planning to crush the British Empire. When war began, Northcliffe&#x27;s call for conscription was seen by some as controversial, although he was vindicated when conscription was introduced in 1916. On 21 May 1915, Northcliffe criticised Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, regarding weapons and munitions. Kitchener was considered by some to be a national hero. The paper&#x27;s circulation dropped from 1,386,000 to 238,000. Fifteen hundred members of the London Stock Exchange burned unsold copies and called for a boycott of the Harmsworth Press. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith accused the paper of being disloyal to the country.

When Kitchener died, the &quot;Mail&quot; reported it as a great stroke of luck for the British Empire. The paper was critical of Asquith&#x27;s conduct of the war, and he resigned on 5 December 1916. His successor David Lloyd George asked Northcliffe to be in his cabinet, hoping it would prevent him from criticising the government. Northcliffe declined.

According to Piers Brendon:
:Northcliffe&#x27;s methods made the &quot;Mail&quot; the most successful newspaper hitherto seen in the history of journalism. But by confusing gewgaws with pearls, by selecting the paltry at the expense of the significant, by confirming atavistic prejudices, by oversimplifying the complex, by dramatizing the humdrum, by presenting stories as entertainment and by blurring the difference between news and views, Northcliffe titillated, if he did not debouch, the public mind; he polluted, if he did not poison, the wells of knowledge.

===Inter-war period===

====1919–1930====

Light-hearted stunts enlivened Northcliffe, such as the &#x27;Hat campaign&#x27; in the winter of 1920. This was a contest with a prize of £100 for a new design of hat – a subject in which Northcliffe took a particular interest. There were 40,000 entries and the winner was a cross between a top hat and a bowler christened the &quot;Daily Mail Sandringham Hat&quot;. The paper subsequently promoted the wearing of it but without much success.

In 1919, Alcock and Brown made the first flight across the Atlantic, winning a prize of £10,000 from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In 1930 the &quot;Mail&quot; made a great story of another aviation stunt, awarding another prize of £10,000 to Amy Johnson for making the first solo flight from England to Australia.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had begun the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1908. At first, Northcliffe had disdained this as a publicity stunt to sell advertising and he refused to attend. But his wife exerted pressure upon him and he changed his view, becoming more supportive. By 1922 the editorial side of the paper was fully engaged in promoting the benefits of modern appliances and technology to free its female readers from the drudgery of housework. The &quot;Mail&quot; maintained the event until selling it to Media 10 in 2009. As Lord Northcliffe aged, his grip on the paper slackened and there were periods when he was not involved. His physical and mental health declined rapidly in 1921, and he died in August 1922 at age 57. His brother Lord Rothermere took full control of the paper.

In the Chanak Crisis of 1922, Britain almost went to war with Turkey. The Prime Minister David Lloyd George, supported by the War Secretary Winston Churchill, were determined to go to war over the Turkish demand that the British leave their occupation zone with Churchill sending out telegrams asking for Canada, Australia and New Zealand to all send troops for the expected war. George Ward Price, the &quot;extra-special correspondent&quot; of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; was sympathetic towards the beleaguered British garrison at Chanak, but was also sympathetic towards the Turks. Ward Price wrote in his articles that Mustafa Kemal did not have wider ambitions to restore the lost frontiers of the Ottoman Empire and only wanted the Allies to leave Asia Minor. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ran a huge banner headline on 21 September 1922 that stated &quot;Get Out Of Chanak!&quot; In a leader (editorial), the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wrote that the views of Churchill, who very much favored going to war with Turkey, were &quot;bordering on insanity&quot;. The same leader noted that Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King of Canada had rejected Churchill&#x27;s request for troops, which led the leader to warn that Churchill&#x27;s efforts to call upon the Dominions for help for the expected war were endangering the unity of the British empire. Britain was governed by a Liberal-Conservative coalition, and the opposition of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which normally supported the Conservatives, caused many Tories to reconsider continuing the coalition government of Lloyd George. The Chanek crisis ended with the Conservatives pulling out of the coalition, causing Lloyd George&#x27;s downfall and with Britain backing down as the British agreed to pull their troops out of Turkey.

Rothermere had a fundamentally elitist conception of politics, believing that the natural leaders of Britain were upper class men like himself, and he strongly disapproved of the decision to grant women the right to vote together with the end of the franchise requirements that disfranchised lower-class men. Feeling that British women and lower-class men were not really capable of understanding the issues, Rothermere started to lose faith in democracy. In October 1922, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; approved of the Fascist &quot;March on Rome&quot; as the newspaper argued that democracy had failed in Italy, thus requiring Benito Mussolini to set up his Fascist dictatorship to save the social order. In 1923, Rothermere published a leader in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; entitled &quot;What Europe Owes Mussolini&quot;, where he wrote about his &quot;profound admiration&quot; for Mussolini, whom he praised for &quot;in saving Italy he stopped the inroads of Bolshevism which would have left Europe in ruins...in my judgment he saved the entire Western world. It was because Mussolini overthrew Bolshevism in Italy that it collapsed in Hungary and ceased to gain adherents in Bavaria and Prussia&quot;. In 1923, the newspaper supported the Italian occupation of Corfu and condemned the British government for at least rhetorically opposing the Italian attack on Greece.

On 25 October 1924, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published the Zinoviev letter, which indicated Moscow was directing British Communists toward violent revolution. It was later proven to be a hoax. At the time many on the left blamed the letter for the defeat of Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour Party in the 1924 general election, held four days later.

Unlike most newspapers, the &quot;Mail&quot; quickly took up an interest on the new medium of radio. In 1928, the newspaper established an early example of an offshore radio station aboard a yacht, both as a means of self-promotion and as a way to break the BBC&#x27;s monopoly. However, the project failed as the equipment was not able to provide a decent signal from overboard, and the transmitter was replaced by a set of speakers. The yacht spent the summer entertaining beach-goers with gramophone records interspersed with publicity for the newspaper and its insurance fund. The &quot;Mail&quot; was also a frequent sponsor on continental commercial radio stations targeted towards Britain throughout the 1920s and 1930s and periodically voiced support for the legalisation of private radio, something that would not happen until 1973.

From 1923, Lord Rothermere and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; formed an alliance with the other great press baron, Lord Beaverbrook. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader Stanley Baldwin. Rothermere in a leader conceded that Fascist methods were &quot;not suited to a country like our own&quot;, but qualified his remark with the statement, &quot;if our northern cities became Bolshevik we would need them&quot;. In an article in 1927 celebrating five years of Fascism in Italy, it was argued that there were parallels between modern Britain and Italy in the last years of the Liberal era as it was argued Italy had a series of weak liberal and conservative governments that made concessions to the Italian Socialist Party such as granting universal male suffrage in 1912 whose &quot;only result was to hasten the arrival of disorder&quot;. In the same article, Baldwin was compared to the Italian prime ministers of the Liberal era as the article argued that the General Strike of 1926 should never have been allowed to occur and the Baldwin government was condemned &quot;for the feebleness which it tries to placate opposition by being more Socialist than the Socialists&quot;. In 1928, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in a leader praised Mussolini as &quot;the great figure of the age. Mussolini will probably dominate the history of the twentieth century as Napoleon dominated the early nineteen century&quot;.

By 1929, George Ward Price was writing in the &quot;Mail&quot; that Baldwin should be deposed and Beaverbrook elected as leader. In early 1930, the two Lords launched the United Empire Party, which the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; supported enthusiastically. Like Lord Beaverbrook, Rothemere was outraged by Baldwin&#x27;s centre-right style of Conservatism and his decision to respond to almost universal suffrage by expanding the appeal of the Conservative Party. Far from seeing giving women the right to vote as the disaster Rothermere believed that it was, Baldwin set out to appeal to female voters, a tactic that was politically successful, but led Rothermere to accuse Baldwing of &quot;feminising&quot; the Conservative Party.

The rise of the new party dominated the newspaper, and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral Ernest Augustus Taylor fought the first by-election for the United Empire Party in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin&#x27;s position was now in doubt, but in 1931 Duff Cooper won the key by-election at St George&#x27;s, Westminster, beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir Ernest Petter, supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons.

In 1927, the celebrated picture of the year &quot;Morning&quot; by Dod Procter was bought by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for the Tate Gallery.

In 1927, Rothermere, under the influence of his Hungarian mistress, Countess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, took up the cause of Hungary as his own, publishing a leader on 21 June 1927 entitled &quot;Hungary&#x27;s Place in the Sun&quot;. In &quot;Hungary&#x27;s Place in the Sun&quot;, he approvingly noted that Hungary was dominated both politically and economically by its &quot;chivalrous and warlike aristocracy&quot;, whom he noted in past centuries had battled the Ottoman Empire, leading him to conclude that all of Europe owned a profound debt to the Hungarian aristocracy which had been &quot;Europe&#x27;s bastion against which the forces of Mahomet [the Prophet Mohammed] vainly hurled themselves against&quot;. Rothemere argued that it was unjust that the &quot;noble&quot; Hungarians should be under the rule of &quot;cruder and more barbaric races&quot;, by which he meant the peoples of Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. In his leader, he advocated that Hungary retake all of the lands lost under the Treaty of Trianon, which caused immediate concern in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Romania, where it was believed that his leader reflected British government policy. Additionally, he took up the cause of the Sudeten Germans, stating that the Sudetenland should go to Germany. The Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Edvard Beneš was so concerned that he visited London to meet King George V, a man who detested Rothermere and used language that was so crude, vulgar and &quot;unkingy&quot; that Beneš had to report to Prague that he could not possibly repeat the king&#x27;s remarks. In fact, Rothermere&#x27;s &quot;Justice for Hungary&quot; campaign, which he continued until February 1939, was a source of disquiet for the Foreign Office, which complained that British relations with Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania were constantly stained as the leaders of those nations continued to harbor the belief that Rothermere was in some way speaking for the British government.

One of the major themes of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; was the opposition to the Indian independence movement and much of Rothermere&#x27;s opposition to Baldwin was based upon the belief that Baldwin was not sufficiently opposed to Indian independence. In 1930, Rothermere wrote a series of leaders under the title &quot;If We Lose India!&quot;, claiming that granting India independence would be the end of Britain as a great power. In addition, Rothermere predicted that Indian independence would end worldwide white supremacy as inevitably, the peoples of the other British colonies in Asia, Africa, and the Americas would also demand independence. The decision of the Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald to open the Round Table Conferences in 1930 was greeted by &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; as the beginning of the end of Britain as a great power. As part of its crusade against Indian independence, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; published a series of articles portraying the peoples of India as ignorant, barbarous, filthy and fanatical, arguing that the Raj was necessary to save India from the Indians, whom &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; argued were not capable of handling independence.

====1930–1934====
Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, and directed the Mail&#x27;s editorial stance towards them in the early 1930s. Lord Rothermere took an extreme anti-Communist line, which led him to own an estate in Hungary to which he might escape to in case Britain was conquered by the Soviet Union. Shortly after the Nazis scored their breakthrough in the Reichstag elections on 14 September 1930, winning 107 seats, Rothermere went to Munich to interview Hitler. In an article published in &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 24 September 1930, Rothemere wrote: &quot;These young Germans have discovered, as I am glad to note that the young men and women of England are discovering, that is no good trusting the old politicians. Accordingly, they have formed, as I should like to see our British youth form, a parliamentary party of their own...We can do nothing to check this movement [the Nazis], and I believe it would be a blunder for the British people to take up an attitude of hostility towards it.&quot; Starting in December 1931, Rothermere opened up talks with Oswald Mosley under which terms the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; would support his party. The talks were drawn out largely because Mosley understood that Rothermere was a megalomaniac who wanted to use the New Party for his own purposes as he sought to impose terms and conditions in exchange for the support of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Mosley, who was equally egoistical, wanted Rothermere&#x27;s support, but only on his own terms.

Rothermere&#x27;s 1933 leader &quot;Youth Triumphant&quot; praised the new Nazi regime&#x27;s accomplishments, and was subsequently used as propaganda by them. In it, Rothermere predicted that &quot;The minor misdeeds of individual Nazis would be submerged by the immense benefits the new regime is already bestowing upon Germany&quot;. Journalist John Simpson, in a book on journalism, suggested that Rothermere was referring to the violence against Jews and Communists rather than the detention of political prisoners. Alongside his support for Nazi Germany as the &quot;bulwark against Bolshevism&quot;, Rothermere used &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; as a forum to champion his pet cause, namely a stronger Royal Air Force (RAF). Rothermere had decided that aerial war was the technology of the future, and throughout the 1930s &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; was described as &quot;obsessional&quot; in pressing for more spending on the RAF.

Rothermere and the &quot;Mail&quot; were also editorially sympathetic to Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists. Rothermere wrote an article titled &quot;Hurrah for the Blackshirts&quot; published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; on 15 January 1934, praising Mosley for his &quot;sound, commonsense, Conservative doctrine&quot;, and pointing out that: &quot;Young men may join the British Union of Fascists by writing to the Headquarters, King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea, London, S.W.&quot; &quot;The Spectator&quot; condemned Rothermere&#x27;s article commenting that, &quot;... the Blackshirts, like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, appeal to people unaccustomed to thinking. The average &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reader is a potential Blackshirt ready made. When Lord Rothermere tells his clientele to go and join the Fascists some of them pretty certainly will.&quot; In April 1934, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ran a competition entitled &quot;Why I Like The Blackshirts&quot; under which it awarded one pound every week for the best letter from its readers explaining why they liked the BUF. The paper&#x27;s support ended after violence at a BUF rally in Kensington Olympia in June 1934. Mosley and many others thought Rothermere had responded to pressure from Jewish businessmen who it was believed had threatened to stop advertising in the paper if it continued to back an anti-Semitic party. The paper editorially continued to oppose the arrival of Jewish refugees escaping Germany, describing their arrival as &quot;a problem to which the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; has repeatedly pointed.&quot;

In December 1934, Rothermere visited Berlin as the guest of Joachim von Ribbentrop. During his visit, Rothermere was publicly thanked in a speech by Josef Goebbels for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s pro-German coverage of the Saarland referendum, under which the people of the Saarland had the choices of voting to remain under the rule of the League of Nations, join France, or rejoin Germany. In March 1935, impressed by the arguments put forward by Ribbentrop for the return of the former German colonies in Africa, Rothermere published a leader entitled &quot;Germany Must Have Elbow Room&quot;. In his leader, Rothermere argued that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards the &quot;Reich&quot; and claimed that the German economy was being crippled by the loss of the German colonial empire in Africa as he argued that without African colonies to exploit that the German economic recovery from the Great Depression was fragile and shallow.

During the Spanish Civil War, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ran a photo-essay on 27 July 1936 by Ferdinand Touchy entitled &quot;The Red Carmens, the women who burn churches&quot;. Touchy took a series of photographs of Spanish women who joined the Worker&#x27;s Militia marching up to the front with rifles and ammunition pouches over their shoulders. In an essay that has been widely criticised as misogynistic, Touchy wrote: &quot;The Spanish women has been a creature to admire or make work domestically, to marry or let slip away into a religious order...65 percent were illiterate&quot;. Touchy declared his horror at the young Spanish women had rejected the traditional patriarchal system, writing with disgust that the &quot;direct action girls&quot; of the Worker&#x27;s Militia do not want to be like their mothers, submissive and obedient to men. Touchy called these young women &quot;Red Carmens&quot;, associating them with the destructive heroine of the opera &quot;Carmen&quot; and with Communism, writing the &quot;Red Carmens&quot; proved the amorality of the Spanish Republic, which had preached gender equality. For Touchy, women to fight in a war was to reject their femininity, leading him to label these women as monstrous as he accused the &quot;Red Carmens&quot; of &quot;sexual depravity&quot;, writing with utter horror at the possibility of these women engaging in premarital sex, which for him marked the beginning of the end of &quot;civilisation&quot; itself. The British historian Caroline Brothers wrote that Touchy&#x27;s article said much about the gender politics of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, which ran his photo-essay and presumably of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s readers who were expected to approve of the article.

In a 1937 article, George Ward Price, the special correspondent of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, approvingly wrote: &quot;The sense of national unity-the &quot;Volkgemeinschaft&quot;-to which the &quot;Führer&quot; constantly appeals in his speeches is not a rhetorical invention, but a reality&quot;. Ward Price was one of the most controversial British journalists of the 1930s, who was one of the few British journalists allowed to interview both Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler because both fascist leaders knew that Ward Price could be trusted to take a favorable tone and ask &quot;soft&quot; questions. Wickham Steed called Ward Price &quot;the lackey of Mussolini, Hitler and Rothermere&quot;. The British historian Daniel Stone called Ward Price&#x27;s reporting from Berlin and Rome &quot;a mixture of snobbery, name dropping and obsequious pro-fascism of a most genteel &#x27;English&#x27; type&quot;. In the 1938 crisis over the Sudetenland, &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; was very hostile in its picture of President Edvard Beneš, whom Rothermere noted disapprovingly in a leader in July 1938 had signed an alliance with the Soviet Union in 1935, leading him to accuse Beneš of turning &quot;Czechoslovakia into a corridor for Russia against Germany&quot;. Rothermere concluded his leader: &quot;If Czechoslovakia becomes involved in a war, the British nation will say to the Prime Minister with one voice: &#x27;Keep out of it!&#x27;&quot;

During the Danzig crisis, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was inadvertently used by the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to persuade Hitler that Britain would not go to war for the defense of Poland. Ribbentrop had the German Embassy in London headed by Herbert von Dirksen provide translations from pro-appeasement newspapers like the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; for Hitler&#x27;s benefit, which had the effect of making it seem that British public opinion was more strongly against going to war for Poland than was actually the case. The British historian Victor Rothwell wrote that the newspapers that Ribbentrop used to provide his press summaries for Hitler such as the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, were out of touch not only with British public opinion, but also with British government policy in regards to the Danzig crisis. The press summaries Ribbentrop provided were particularly important as Ribbentrop had managed to convince Hitler that the British government secretly controlled the British press, and just as in Germany, nothing appeared in the British press that the British government did not want to appear.

===Post-war history===

On 5 May 1946, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; celebrated its Golden Jubilee. Winston Churchill was the chief guest at the banquet and toasted it with a speech. Newsprint rationing in the Second World War had forced the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to cut its size to four pages, but the size gradually increased through the 1950s. In 1947, when the Raj ended, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; featured a banner headline reading &quot;India: 11 words mark the end of an empire&quot;. During the Suez crisis of 1956, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; consistently took a hardline against President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, taking the viewpoint that Britain was justified in invading Egypt to retake control of the Suez canal and topple Nasser.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was transformed by its editor during the 1970s and 1980s, David English. He had been editor of the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; from 1969 to 1971, when it closed. Part of the same group from 1953, the &quot;Sketch&quot; was absorbed by its sister title, and English became editor of the &quot;Mail&quot;, a post in which he remained for more than 20 years. English transformed it from a struggling newspaper selling half as many copies as its mid-market rival, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, to a formidable publication, whose circulation rose to surpass that of the &quot;Express&quot; by the mid-1980s. English was knighted in 1982.

The paper enjoyed a period of journalistic success in the 1980s, employing Fleet Street writers such as gossip columnist Nigel Dempster, Lynda Lee-Potter and sportswriter Ian Wooldridge (who unlike some of his colleagues – the paper generally did not support sporting boycotts of white-minority-ruled South Africa – strongly opposed apartheid). In 1982 a Sunday title, the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, was launched (the Scottish &quot;Sunday Mail&quot;, now owned by the Mirror Group, was founded in 1919 by the first Lord Rothermere, but later sold).

Knighted in 1982, Sir David English became editor-in-chief and chairman of Associated Newspapers in 1992 after Rupert Murdoch had attempted to hire &quot;Evening Standard&quot; editor Paul Dacre as editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; was then part of the Associated Newspapers group, and Dacre was appointed to succeed English at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a means of dealing with Murdoch&#x27;s offer. Dacre retired as editor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; but remains editor-in-chief of the group.

In late 2013, the paper moved its London printing operation from the city&#x27;s Docklands area to a new £50 million plant in Thurrock, Essex. There are Scottish editions of both the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, with different articles and columnists.

In August 2016, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; began a partnership with &quot;The People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party. This partnership included publishing articles in the MailOnline produced by The People&#x27;s Daily. The agreement appeared to observers to give the paper an edge in publishing news stories sourced out of China, but it also led to questions of censorship regarding politically sensitive topics.

In November 2016, Lego ended a series of promotions in the paper which had run for years, following a campaign from the group &#x27;Stop Funding Hate&#x27;, who were unhappy with the &quot;Mail&quot;&#x27;s coverage of migrant issues and the EU referendum.

In September 2017, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; partnered with Stage 29 Productions to launch DailyMailTV, an international news program produced by Stage 29 Productions in its studios based in New York City with satellite studios in London, Sydney, DC and Los Angeles. Dr. Phil McGraw (Stage 29 Productions) was named as executive producer. The program was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment News Program in 2018.

In May 2020, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ended &quot;The Sun&#x27;s&quot; 42-year reign as the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest-circulation newspaper. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; recorded average daily sales of 980,000 copies, with the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; recording weekly sales of 878,000.

In August 2022, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; wrote in support of Liz Truss in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election, calling her chancellor&#x27;s mini-budget &quot;a true Tory budget&quot; that September.

==Scottish, Irish, Continental, and Indian editions==

===&quot;Scottish Daily Mail&quot;===

The &quot;Scottish Daily Mail&quot; was published as a separate title from Edinburgh starting in December 1946. The circulation was poor though, falling to below 100,000 and the operation was rebased to Manchester in December 1968. The &quot;Scottish Daily Mail&quot; was relaunched in 1995; it is printed in Glasgow. It had an average circulation of 67,900 in the area of Scotland in December 2019.

===&quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot;===

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; officially entered the Irish market with the launch of a local version of the paper on 6 February 2006; free copies of the paper were distributed on that day in some locations to publicise the launch. Its masthead differed from that of UK versions by having a green rectangle with the word &quot;IRISH&quot;, instead of the Royal Arms, but this was later changed, with &quot;Irish Daily Mail&quot; displayed instead. The Irish version includes stories of Irish interest alongside content from the UK version. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the Irish edition had a circulation of 63,511 for July 2007, falling to an average of 49,090 for the second half of 2009. Since 24 September 2006 &quot;Ireland on Sunday&quot;, the Irish Sunday newspaper acquired by Associated in 2001, was replaced by an Irish edition of the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; (the &quot;Irish Mail on Sunday&quot;), to tie in with the weekday newspaper.

===&quot;Continental&quot; and &quot;Overseas Daily Mail&quot;===
Two foreign editions were begun in 1904 and 1905; the former titled the &quot;Overseas Daily Mail&quot;, covering the world, and the latter titled the &quot;Continental Daily Mail&quot;, covering Europe and North Africa.

===&quot;Mail Today&quot;===

The newspaper entered India on 16 November 2007 with the launch of &quot;Mail Today&quot;, a 48-page compact size newspaper printed in Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida with a print run of 110,000 copies. Based around a subscription model, the newspaper has the same fonts and feel as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and was set up with investment from Associated Newspapers and editorial assistance from the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newsroom. The paper alternated between supporting the Congress-led UPA regime as well as the BJP-led NDA regime. Between 2010 and 2014, it supported the Kapil Sibal–led reforms to change the undergraduate structure at the University of Delhi. In 2016, it was the first newspaper to break the controversial story about terror slogans being raised in favour of the hanged terrorist Afzal Guru on his death anniversary at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi.

==Editorial stance==
As a right-wing tabloid, the &quot;Mail&quot; is traditionally a supporter of the Conservative Party. It has endorsed the party in every UK general election since 1945, with the one exception of the October 1974 UK general election, where it endorsed a Liberal and Conservative coalition. While the paper retained its support for the Conservative Party at the 2015 general election, the paper urged conservatively inclined voters to support UKIP in the constituencies of Heywood and Middleton, Dudley North, and Great Grimsby where UKIP was the main challenger to the Labour Party.

On international affairs, regarding the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia, the &quot;Mail&quot; said that Russia had &quot;behaved with shocking arrogance and brutality&quot;, but accused the British government of dragging Britain into an unnecessary confrontation with Russia and of hypocrisy regarding its protests over Russian recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia&#x27;s independence, citing the British government&#x27;s own recognition of Kosovo&#x27;s independence from Russia&#x27;s ally Serbia.

The &quot;Mail&quot; published an article by Joanna Blythman in 2012 opposing the growing of genetically modified crops in the United Kingdom.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; endorsed voting leave in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum.

==Noted reporting==

===Suffragette===
The term &quot;suffragette&quot; was first used in 1906, as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the &quot;Mail&quot; to describe activists in the movement for women&#x27;s suffrage, in particular members of the WSPU. However, the women he intended to ridicule embraced the term, saying &quot;suffraGETtes&quot; (hardening the &#x27;g&#x27;), implying not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to &#x27;get&#x27; it.

===Zinoviev Letter===

In 1924, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published a letter before the elections in Britain. the letter was purportedly written by Grigory Zinoviev to call for Bolshevik-like revolution in UK. The letter&#x27;s authenticity has since been questioned.

===Holes in the road===
On 17 January 1967, the &quot;Mail&quot; published a story, &quot;The holes in our roads&quot;, about potholes, giving the examples of Blackburn where it said there were 4,000 holes. This detail was then immortalised by John Lennon in The Beatles song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, along with an account of the death of 21-year-old socialite Tara Browne in a car crash on 18 December 1966, which also appeared in the same issue.

===Unification Church===
In 1981, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ran an investigation into the Unification Church, nicknamed the Moonies, accusing them of ending marriages and brainwashing converts. The Unification Church, which always denied these claims, sued for libel but lost heavily. A jury awarded the &quot;Mail&quot; a then record-breaking £750,000 libel payout (). In 1983 the paper won a special British Press Award for a &quot;relentless campaign against the malignant practices of the Unification Church.&quot;

===Gay gene controversy===
On 16 July 1993, the &quot;Mail&quot; ran the headline &quot;Abortion hope after &#x27;gay genes&#x27; finding&quot;. Of the tabloid headlines which commented on the Xq28 gene, the Mail&#x27;s was criticised as &quot;perhaps the most infamous and disturbing headline of all&quot;.

===Stephen Lawrence===
The &quot;Mail&quot; campaigned vigorously for justice over the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993. On 14 February 1997, the &quot;Mail&quot; front page pictured the five men accused of Lawrence&#x27;s murder with the headline &quot;MURDERERS&quot;, stating &quot;if we are wrong, let them sue us&quot;. This attracted praise from Paul Foot and Peter Preston. Some journalists contended the &quot;Mail&quot; had belatedly changed its stance on the Lawrence murder, with the newspaper&#x27;s earlier focus being the alleged opportunistic behaviour of anti-racist groups (&quot;How Race Militants Hijacked a Tragedy&quot;, 10 May 1993) and alleged insufficient coverage of the case (20 articles in three years).

Two men who the &quot;Mail&quot; had featured in their &quot;Murderers&quot; headline were found guilty in 2012 of murdering Lawrence. After the verdict, Lawrence&#x27;s parents and numerous political figures thanked the newspaper for taking the potential financial risk involved with the 1997 headline.

===Stephen Gately===
On 16 October 2009, a Jan Moir article criticised aspects of the life and death of Stephen Gately. It was published six days after his death and before his funeral. The Press Complaints Commission received over 25,000 complaints, a record number, regarding the timing and content of the article. It was criticised as insensitive, inaccurate and homophobic. The Press Complaints Commission did not uphold complaints about the article. Major advertisers, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, had their adverts removed from the &quot;Mail Online&quot; webpage containing Moir&#x27;s article.

===Cannabis use===
On 13 June 2011, a study by Matt Jones and Michal Kucewicz on the effects of cannabinoid receptor activation in the brain was published in &quot;The Journal of Neuroscience&quot; and the British medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;. The study was used in articles by &quot;CBS News&quot;, &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, and &quot;Bild&quot; among others.

In October 2011, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; printed an article citing the research, titled &quot;Just ONE cannabis joint can bring on schizophrenia as well as damaging memory.&quot; The group Cannabis Law Reform (CLEAR), which campaigns for ending drug prohibition, criticised the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; report. Matt Jones, co-author of the study, said he was &quot;disappointed but not surprised&quot; by the article, and stated: &quot;This study does NOT say that one spliff will bring on schizophrenia&quot;. Dorothy Bishop, professor of neuroscience at Oxford University, in her blog awarded the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; the &quot;Orwellian Prize for Journalistic Misrepresentation&quot;, The &quot;Mail&quot; later changed the article&#x27;s headline to: &quot;Just ONE cannabis joint &#x27;can cause psychiatric episodes similar to schizophrenia&#x27; as well as damaging memory.&quot;

===Ralph Miliband article===
In September 2013, the &quot;Mail&quot; was criticised for an article on Ralph Miliband (late father of then Labour-leader Ed Miliband and prominent Marxist sociologist), titled &quot;The Man Who Hated Britain&quot;. Ed Miliband said that the article was &quot;ludicrously untrue&quot;, that he was &quot;appalled&quot; and &quot;not willing to see my father&#x27;s good name be undermined in this way&quot;. Ralph Miliband had arrived in the UK from Belgium as a Jewish refugee from the Holocaust. The &quot;Jewish Chronicle&quot; described the article as &quot;a revival of the &#x27;Jews can&#x27;t be trusted because of their divided loyalties&#x27; genre of antisemitism.&quot; Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith linked the article to the Nazi sympathies of the 1st Viscount Rothermere, whose family remain the paper&#x27;s owners.

The paper defended the article&#x27;s general content in an editorial, but described its use of a picture of Ralph Miliband&#x27;s grave as an &quot;error of judgement&quot;. In the editorial, the paper further remarked that &quot;We do not maintain, like the jealous God of Deuteronomy, that the iniquity of the fathers should be visited on the sons. But when a son with prime ministerial ambitions swallows his father&#x27;s teachings, as the younger Miliband appears to have done, the case is different.&quot; A spokesman for the paper also described claims that the article continued its history of anti-Semitism as &quot;absolutely spurious.&quot; However, the reference to &quot;the jealous God of Deuteronomy&quot; was criticised by Jonathan Freedland, who said that &quot;In the context of a piece about a foreign-born Jew, [the remark] felt like a subtle, if not subterranean hint to the reader, a reminder of the ineradicable alienness of this biblically vengeful people&quot; and that &quot;those ready to acquit the Mail because there was no bald, outright statement of antisemitism were probably using the wrong measure.&quot;

===Gawker Media lawsuit===
In March 2015, James King, a former contract worker at the &quot;Mail&#x27;s&quot; New York office, wrote an article for &quot;Gawker&quot; titled &#x27;My Year Ripping Off the Web With the &quot;Daily Mail Online&quot;″. In the article, King alleged that the &quot;Mail″s&quot; approach was to rewrite stories from other news outlets with minimal credit in order to gain advertising clicks, and that staffers had published material they knew to be false. He also suggested that the paper preferred to delete stories from its website rather than publish corrections or admit mistakes.

In September 2015, the &quot;Mail&#x27;s&quot; US company Mail Media filed a $1 million lawsuit against King and Gawker Media for libel. Eric Wemple at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; questioned the value of the lawsuit, stating that &quot;Whatever the merits of King&#x27;s story, it didn&#x27;t exactly upend conventional wisdom&quot; about the website&#x27;s strategy. In November 2016, Lawyers for &quot;Gawker&quot; filed a motion to resolve the lawsuit. Under the terms of the motion, &quot;Gawker&quot; was not required to pay any financial compensation, but agreed to add an Editor&#x27;s Note at the beginning of the King article, remove an illustration in the post which incorporated the Daily Mail&#x27;s logo, and publish a statement by DailyMail.com in the same story.

===Anti-refugee cartoon===
Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, a cartoon in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; by Stanley McMurtry (&quot;Mac&quot;) linked the European migrant crisis (with a focus on Syria in particular) to the terrorist attacks, and criticised the European Union immigration laws for allowing Islamist radicals to gain easy access into the United Kingdom. Despite being compared to Nazi propaganda, and criticised as racist, the cartoon received praise on the Mail Online website. A &quot;Daily Mail&quot; spokesperson told &quot;The Independent&quot;: &quot;We are not going to dignify these absurd comments which wilfully misrepresent this cartoon apart from to say that we have not received a single complaint from any reader&quot;. Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, criticised the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s cartoon for being &quot;reckless xenophobia&quot;.

===Anthony Weiner scandal===
In September 2016, the &quot;Mail Online&quot; published a lengthy interview and screenshots from a 15-year-old girl who claimed that the American politician Anthony Weiner had sent her sexually explicit images and messages. The revelation led to Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin – an aide of Hillary Clinton – separating. Weiner pleaded guilty in May 2017 to sending obscene material to a minor, and in September he was jailed for 21 months.

===Campaigns against plastic pollution===
The paper has campaigned against plastic pollution in various forms since 2008. The paper called for a levy on single use plastic bags. The Daily Mail&#x27;s work in highlighting the issue of plastic pollution was praised by the head of the United Nations Environment Program, Erik Solheim at a conference in Kenya in 2017. Emily Maitlis, the newscaster, asked Green Party leader Caroline Lucas on &quot;Newsnight&quot;, &#x27;Is the biggest friend to the Environment at the moment the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;?&#x27; in reference to the paper&#x27;s call for a ban on plastic microbeads and other plastic pollution, and suggested it had done more for the environment than the Green Party. Environment group ClientEarth has also highlighted the paper&#x27;s role in drawing attention to the plastic pollution problem along with the Blue Planet II documentary.

===Gary McKinnon deportation===
Attempts by the United States government to extradite Gary McKinnon, a British computer hacker, were campaigned against by the paper. In 2002, McKinnon was accused of perpetrating the &quot;biggest military computer hack of all time&quot; although McKinnon himself states that he was merely looking for evidence of free energy suppression and a cover-up of UFO activity and other technologies potentially useful to the public. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; began to support McKinnon&#x27;s campaign in 2009 – with a series of front-page stories protesting against his deportation.

On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, Home Secretary Theresa May withdrew her extradition order to the United States. Gary McKinnon&#x27;s mother Janis Sharp praised the paper&#x27;s contribution to saving her son from deportation in her book in which she said: &#x27;Thanks to Theresa May, David Cameron and the support of David Burrowes and so many others – notably the Daily Mail – my son was safe, he was going to live.&#x27;

=== Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed ===
In December 2017, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published a front-page story entitled &quot;Another human rights fiasco!&quot;, with the subheading &quot;Iraqi &#x27;caught red-handed with bomb&#x27; wins £33,000 – because our soldiers kept him in custody for too long&quot;. The story related to a judge&#x27;s decision to award money to Abd Ali Hameed al-Waheed after he had been unlawfully imprisoned. The headline was printed despite the fact that during the trial itself the judge concluded that claims that al-Waheed had been caught with a bomb were &quot;pure fiction&quot;.

In July 2018, the Independent Press Standards Organisation ordered the paper to publish a front-page correction after finding the newspaper had breached rules on accuracy in its reporting of the case. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; reported that a major internal investigation was conducted following the decision to publish the story, and as a result, &quot;strongly worded disciplinary notes were sent to seven senior members of staff&quot;, which made it clear &quot;that if errors of the same nature were to happen again, their careers would be at risk&quot;.

=== Doctored image of Korean soldiers in Ukraine ===
On December 4, 2024, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published an online story about the Russo-Ukrainian War under the headline “Kim Jong Un sends North Korean women to fight as cannon fodder for Putin in Ukraine”. The story was accompanied by a photo of what appeared to be two Korean women in combat fatigues. It was later revealed that the photo was an older image of two Russian soldiers whose facial features had been doctored to appear Korean. According to &quot;Mediaite&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; &quot;received backlash and ridicule on social media before it removed the article and issued a correction notice&quot;.

==Libel lawsuits==
* 2017, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; editor Paul Dacre threatened the website &quot;Byline Investigates&quot; with legal action and insisted on the removal of three articles about the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s use of private investigator Steve Whittamore.
* On 15 November 2019, &quot;Byline Investigates&quot; published court documents of a lawsuit filed by Meghan Markle against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in which she accused the newspaper of a campaign of &quot;untrue&quot; stories.

* 2017, April: First Lady of the United States, Melania Trump, received an undisclosed settlement over claims in the &quot;Mail&quot; that she had worked as an escort in the 1990s. In September 2016, she began litigation against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for an article which discussed escort allegations. The article included rebuttals and said that there was no evidence to support the allegations. The &quot;Mail&quot; regretted any misinterpretation that could have come from reading the article, and retracted it from its website. Melania Trump filed a lawsuit in Maryland, suing for $150 million. On 7 February 2017, the lawsuit was re-filed in the correct jurisdiction, New York, where the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s parent company has offices, seeking damages of at least $150 million.

===Unsuccessful lawsuits===
* 1981, April: The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; won £750,000 from the Unification Church, which had sued for libel due to articles about the Church&#x27;s recruitment methods. Margaret Singer, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Berkeley, testified that the &quot;Mail&quot;″s accounts of these methods were accurate. The trial lasted over five months, one of Britain&#x27;s longest-ever civil trials.
* 2012, February: Nathaniel Rothschild lost his libel case against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, after the High Court agreed that he was indeed the &quot;Puppet Master&quot; for Peter Mandelson, that his conduct had been &quot;inappropriate in a number of respects&quot; and that the words used by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; were &quot;substantially true&quot;.

This and a series of other events involving Pryce and Huhne led to his resignation from the Cabinet, and to both of them being arrested for perverting the course of justice and the criminal prosecution &quot;R v Huhne and Pryce&quot;.
* 2021: Former US congress representative Katie Hill was judicially ordered to reimburse the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and others $220,000 for legal fees incurred defending themselves against baseless revenge porn claims raised by Hill.

===Legal action by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;===
In March 2021, Associated Newspapers issued a letter to ViacomCBS to remove an image of a purported &quot;Daily Mail&quot; headline from &quot;Oprah with Meghan and Harry&quot;. The headline seen was &quot;Meghan&#x27;s seed will taint our Royal Family&quot;, which had been edited to remove the context that it was a quotation by an unrelated politician.

==Criticism==
===Paying for footage under investigation===
In 2015, following the November 2015 Paris attacks, the French police viewed the footage of the attacks from the CCTV system of La Casa Nostra. After making a copy on a USB flash drive, the police ordered a technician from the CCTV company that installed the system to encrypt the footage, saying &#x27;this now falls under the confidentiality of the investigation, it must remain here&#x27;. Freelance journalist Djaffer Ait Aoudia told &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he secretly filmed a &quot;Daily Mail&quot; representative negotiating with the owner to sell the CCTV footage of the attacks. The café owner agreed to supply the footage for €50,000 and asked an IT technician to make the footage accessible again. &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; responded: &quot;There is nothing controversial about the Mail&#x27;s acquisition of this video, a copy of which the police already had in their possession.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; also, briefly, embedded the footage on their own website before removing it.

===Byline removal===
In 2017, &quot;evoke.ie&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; showbiz site, was reported to the internship program of Dublin City University after the bylines of hundreds of articles written by students were changed.

===Sensationalism===
&quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; have an &quot;ongoing project to divide all the inanimate objects in the world into ones that either cause or prevent cancer&quot;. It has also been criticised for their extent of coverage of celebrities, the children of celebrities, property prices, and the depiction of asylum seekers, the latter of which was discussed in the Parliament&#x27;s Joint Committee on Human Rights in 2007.

===Reliability===
The &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s medical and science journalism has been criticised by some doctors and scientists, accusing it of using minor studies to generate scare stories or being misleading. In 2011, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published an article titled &quot;Just ONE cannabis joint &#x27;can cause psychiatric episodes similar to schizophrenia&#x27; as well as damaging memory&quot;. Matt Jones, the lead author of the study that is cited in the article was quoted by Cannabis Law Reform as saying: &quot;This study does NOT say that one spliff will bring on schizophrenia&quot;.

Carbon Brief complained to the Press Complaints Commission about an article published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; titled &quot;Hidden green tax in fuel bills: How a £200 stealth charge is slipped on to your gas and electricity bills&quot; because the £200 figure was unexplained, unreferenced and, according to Ofgem, incorrect. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; quietly removed the article from their website.

In 2013, the Met Office criticised an article about climate change in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; by James Delingpole for containing &quot;a series of factual inaccuracies&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in response published a letter from the Met Office chairman on its letters page, as well as offering to append the letter to Delingpole&#x27;s article.

In August 2018, the &quot;Mail Online&quot; deleted a lengthy news article titled &quot;Powder Keg Paris&quot; by journalist Andrew Malone which focused on &quot;illegal migrants&quot; living in the Paris suburb of Saint Denis, after a string of apparent inaccuracies were highlighted on social media by French activist Marwan Muhammad, including mistaking Saint-Denis, the city, for Seine-Saint-Denis, the department northeast of Paris. Local councillor Majid Messaoudene said that the article had set out to &quot;stigmatise&quot; and &quot;harm&quot; the area and its people. The journalist, Andrew Malone, subsequently deleted his Twitter account. In 2019, the IPSO ruled against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and confirmed in its ruling that the article was inaccurate.

In early 2019, the mobile version of the Microsoft Edge web browser started warning visitors to the MailOnline site, via its NewsGuard plugin, that &quot;this website generally fails to maintain basic standards of accuracy and accountability&quot; and &quot;has been forced to pay damages in numerous high-profile cases&quot;. In late January 2019, the status of the MailOnline was changed by the NewsGuard Plugin from Red to Green, updating its verdict to &quot;this website generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability&quot;. An Editor&#x27;s Note from NewsGuard stated that &quot;This label now has the benefit of the dailymail.co.uk&#x27;s input and our view is that in some important respects their objections are right and we were wrong&quot;.

==== Wikipedia determination of unreliability ====
In February 2017, pursuant to a formal community discussion, editors on the English Wikipedia banned the use of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; as a source in most cases. Its use as a reference is now &quot;generally prohibited, especially when other more reliable sources exist&quot;, and it can no longer be used as proof of notability. It can still be used in reference to an article about the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; itself. Support for the ban centred on &quot;the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s reputation for poor fact checking, sensationalism, and flat-out fabrication&quot;. Some users opposed the decision, arguing that it is &quot;actually reliable for some subjects&quot; and &quot;may have been more reliable historically.&quot;

Wikipedia&#x27;s ban of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; generated a significant amount of media attention, especially from the British media. Though the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; strongly contested this decision by the community, Wikipedia&#x27;s co-founder Jimmy Wales backed the community&#x27;s choice, stating: &quot;I think what [the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; has] done brilliantly in this ad funded world (is) they&#x27;ve mastered the art of click bait, they&#x27;ve mastered the art of hyped up headlines, they&#x27;ve also mastered the art of, I&#x27;m sad to say, of running stories that simply aren&#x27;t true. And that&#x27;s why Wikipedia decided not to accept them as a source anymore. It&#x27;s very problematic, they get very upset when we say this, but it&#x27;s just fact.&quot; A February 2017 editorial in &quot;The Times&quot; commenting on the decision stated that &quot;Newspapers make errors and have the responsibility to correct them. Wikipedia editors&#x27; fastidiousness, however, appears to reflect less a concern for accuracy than dislike of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s opinions.&quot; &quot;Slate&quot; writer Will Oremus said the decision &quot;should encourage more careful sourcing across Wikipedia while doubling as a richly deserved rebuke to a publication that represents some of the worst forces in online news.&quot;

In 2018, the Wikipedia community upheld the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;&#x27;s deprecation as a source.

===Racism accusations===
There have been accusations of racism against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. In 2012, in an article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, former &quot;Mail&quot; reporter Brendan Montague criticised the &quot;Mail&quot;&#x27;s content and culture, stating: &quot;None of the front-line reporters I worked with were racist, but there&#x27;s institutional racism [at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;]&quot;.

In August 2020, a group of Palm Islanders in Queensland, Australia, lodged a complaint with the Australian Human Rights Commission under Section 18C of the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; against the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and 9News, alleging that they had broadcast and published reports that were inaccurate and racist about the Indigenous Australian recipients of compensation after the Palm Island Class Action.

In 2021, IPSO ruled that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; dishonestly published a headline falsely claiming to report on &quot;British towns that are no-go areas for white people&quot;. The town showcased was the wealthy Manchester suburb of Didsbury, which it had described the previous month as &quot;posh and leafy&quot; and a &quot;property hotspot&quot;.

==Supplements and features==
* &quot;City &amp; Finance&quot;: The business part of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, featuring City news and the results from the London Stock Exchange. It also has its own award-winning website called &quot;This is Money&quot;, which describes itself as the &quot;money section of the MailOnline.&quot;
* &quot;Travelmail&quot;: Contains travel articles, advertisements etc.

Weekend magazine, launched in October 1993, is issued free with the Saturday &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. The guide does not use a magazine-type layout but chooses a newspaper style similar to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; itself. In April 2007, the &quot;Weekend&quot; had a major revamp. A feature changed during the revamp was a dedicated Freeview channel page.

===Regular cartoon strips===
* &quot;Garfield&quot;
* &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe It&quot; (discontinued)
* &quot;Odd Streak&quot;
* &quot;The Strip Show&quot;
* &quot;Chloe and Co.&quot; (by Knight Features)
* &quot;Up and Running&quot; (by Knight Features)
* &quot;Fred Basset&quot;

&quot;Up and Running&quot; is a strip distributed by Knight Features and &quot;Fred Basset&quot; has followed the life of the dog of the same name in a two-part strip in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; since 8 July 1963.

The long-running &quot;Teddy Tail&quot; cartoon strip, was first published on 5 April 1915 and was the first cartoon strip in a British newspaper. It ran for over 40 years to 1960, spawning the &quot;Teddy Tail League&quot; Children&#x27;s Club and many annuals from 1934 to 1942 and again from 1949 to 1962. Teddy Tail was a mouse, with friends Kitty Puss (a cat), Douglas Duck and Dr. Beetle. Teddy Tail is always shown with a knot in his tail.

===Year Book===
The &quot;Daily Mail Year Book&quot; first appeared in 1901, summarizing the news of the past year in one volume of 200 to 400 pages. Among its editors were Percy L. Parker (1901–1905), David Williamson (1914–1951), G. B. Newman (1955–1977), Mary Jenkins (1978–1986), P.J. Failes (1987), and Michael and Caroline Fluskey (1991).

===Online media===

The majority of content appearing in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot; printed newspapers also forms part of that included in the &quot;MailOnline&quot; website. &quot;MailOnline&quot; is free to read and funded by advertising. In 2011 &quot;MailOnline&quot; was the second most visited English-language newspaper website worldwide. It has since then become the most visited newspaper website in the world, with over 189.5 million visitors per month, and 11.7 million visitors daily, as of January 2014.

Thailand&#x27;s military junta blocked the &quot;MailOnline&quot; in May 2014 after the site revealed a video of Thailand&#x27;s Crown Prince and his wife, Princess Srirasmi, partying. The video appears to show the allegedly topless princess, a former waitress, in a tiny G-string as she feeds her pet dog cake to celebrate its birthday.

==The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in pop culture==

In 1966 The Beatles released the song Paperback Writer in which the protagonist was a writer for the &quot;Daily Mail.&quot;

Discussing &quot;Paperback Writer&quot; with Alan Smith of the NME that year, McCartney recalled that he and John Lennon wrote the lyrics in the form of a letter beginning with &quot;Dear Sir or Madam&quot;, but that the song was not inspired by &quot;any real-life characters&quot;. However, according to a 2007 piece in The New Yorker, McCartney said he started writing the song in 1965 after reading in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; about an aspiring author, &quot;possibly Martin Amis&quot; (who would have been a teenager at the time). The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was Lennon&#x27;s regular newspaper and copies were in Lennon&#x27;s Weybridge home when Lennon and McCartney were writing songs.

The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; has appeared in several novels. These include Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Scoop&quot; which was based on Waugh&#x27;s experiences as a writer for the &quot;Daily Mail.&quot; In the book the newspaper is renamed &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;.

The newspaper appeared in Nicci French&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;The Memory Game,&quot; a psychological thriller.

In 2015, it featured in Laurence Simpson&#x27;s comic novel about the tabloid media, &quot;According to The Daily Mail.&quot;

<doc id="177182" wikidata="Q17646138" url="?curid=177182" title="Hulne Priory">
<text>Hulne Priory, Hulne Friary or Hulne Abbey was a friary founded in 1240 by the Carmelites or &#x27;Whitefriars&#x27;. It is said that the Northumberland site, quite close to Alnwick, was chosen for some slight resemblance to Mount Carmel where the order originated. Substantial ruins survive, watched over by the stone figures of friars carved in the 18th century. It is a sign of the unrest felt in this area so near to the border with Scotland that the priory had a surrounding wall and in the 15th century a pele tower was erected. Changes were made at the Dissolution of the Monasteries when the Percy family took control.

The priory is situated in Hulne Park, a walled park covering several thousand acres which belongs to the Duke of Northumberland and is close to Alnwick Castle. Originally a hunting park, and still used by the Duke for shooting, it now contains woods, moors, stretches of open grassland and Alnwick&#x27;s home farm. Apart from the priory, the buildings in the park include the gatehouse of the former Alnwick Abbey, and Brizlee Tower, which is a viewing tower in Gothic Revival style that dates from the 1780s.

The public is admitted to Hulne Park, but it is not marketed as a visitor attraction and has no visitor facilities. Entry is via the approach from Alnwick, and is restricted to pedestrians only. The ruins of the priory may be viewed whilst Brizlee Tower is rarely open to the public.

Hulne Priory was a filming location in HTV&#x27;s &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; with Michael Praed where it doubled for Kirklees Abbey. Later it was Maid Marian&#x27;s home in the 1991 film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;.

The priory is licensed for wedding ceremonies and is occasionally used as a location for live performances.

<doc id="177183" wikidata="Q920343" url="?curid=177183" title="British Union of Fascists">
<text>The British Union of Fascists (BUF) was a British fascist political party formed in 1932 by Oswald Mosley. Mosley changed its name to the British Union of Fascists and National Socialists in 1936 and, in 1937, to the British Union. In 1939, following the start of the Second World War, the party was proscribed by the British government and in 1940 it was disbanded.

The BUF emerged in 1932 from the electoral defeat of its antecedent, the New Party, in the 1931 general election. The BUF&#x27;s foundation was initially met with popular support, and it attracted a sizeable following, with the party claiming 50,000 members at one point. The press baron Lord Rothermere was a notable early supporter. As the party became increasingly radical, however, support declined. The Olympia Rally of 1934, in which a number of anti-fascist protestors were attacked by the paramilitary wing of the BUF, the Fascist Defence Force, isolated the party from much of its following. The party&#x27;s embrace of Nazi-style antisemitism in 1936 led to increasingly violent confrontations with anti-fascists, notably the 1936 Battle of Cable Street in London&#x27;s East End. The Public Order Act 1936, which banned political uniforms and responded to increasing political violence, had a particularly strong effect on the BUF whose supporters were known as &quot;Blackshirts&quot; after the uniforms they wore.

Growing British hostility towards Nazi Germany, with which the British press persistently associated the BUF, further contributed to the decline of the movement&#x27;s membership. The party was finally banned by the British government on 23 May 1940 after the start of the Second World War, amid suspicion that its remaining supporters might form a pro-Nazi &quot;fifth column&quot;. A number of prominent BUF members were arrested and interned under Defence Regulation 18B.

==History==
===Background===

Oswald Mosley was the youngest elected Conservative MP before crossing the floor in 1922, joining first Labour and, shortly afterward, the Independent Labour Party. He became Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government, advising on rising unemployment.

In 1930, Mosley issued his Mosley Memorandum, which fused protectionism with a proto-Keynesian programme of policies designed to tackle the problem of unemployment, and he resigned from the Labour Party soon after, in early 1931, when the plans were rejected. He immediately formed the New Party, with policies based on his memorandum. The party won 16% of the vote at a by-election in Ashton-under-Lyne in early 1931; however, it failed to achieve any other electoral success.

During 1931, the New Party became increasingly influenced by fascism. The following year, after a January 1932 visit to Benito Mussolini in Italy, Mosley&#x27;s own conversion to fascism was confirmed. He wound up the New Party in April, but preserved its youth movement, which would form the core of the BUF, intact. He spent the summer that year writing a fascist programme, &quot;The Greater Britain&quot;, and this formed the basis of policy of the BUF, which was launched on 1 October 1932 at 12 Great George Street in London.

===Early success and growth===
The BUF claimed 50,000 members at one point, and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, running the headline &quot;Hurrah for the Blackshirts!&quot;, was an early supporter. The first Director of Propaganda, appointed in February 1933, was Wilfred Risdon, who was responsible for organising all of Mosley&#x27;s public meetings. Despite strong resistance from anti-fascists, including the local Jewish community, the Labour Party, the Independent Labour Party and the Communist Party of Great Britain, the BUF found a following in the East End of London, where in the London County Council elections of March 1937, it obtained reasonably successful results in Bethnal Green, Shoreditch and Limehouse, polling almost 8,000 votes, although none of its candidates was elected. The BUF did elect a few councillors at local government level during the 1930s (including Charles Bentinck Budd (Worthing, Sussex), 1934; Ronald Creasy (Eye, Suffolk), 1938) but did not win any parliamentary seats. Two former members of the BUF, Major Sir Jocelyn Lucas and Harold Soref, were later elected as Conservative Members of Parliament (MPs).

Having lost the funding of newspaper magnate Lord Rothermere, that it had previously enjoyed, at the 1935 general election the party urged voters to abstain, calling for &quot;Fascism Next Time&quot;. There never was a &quot;next time&quot; as the next general election was not held until July 1945, five years after the dissolution of the BUF.

Towards the middle of the 1930s, the BUF&#x27;s violent clashes with opponents began to alienate some middle-class supporters, and membership decreased. At the Olympia rally in London, in 1934, BUF stewards violently ejected anti-fascist disrupters, and this led the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to withdraw its support for the movement. The level of violence shown at the rally shocked many, with the effect of turning neutral parties against the BUF and contributing to anti-fascist support. One observer claimed: &quot;I came to the conclusion that Mosley was a political maniac, and that all decent English people must combine to kill his movement.&quot;

In Belfast in April 1934 an autonomous wing of the party in Northern Ireland called the &quot;Ulster Fascists&quot; was founded. The branch was a failure and became virtually extinct after less than a year in existence. It had ties with the Blueshirts in the Irish Free State and voiced support for a United Ireland, describing the partition of Ireland as &quot;an insurmountable barrier to peace, and prosperity in Ireland&quot;. Its logo combined the fasces with the Red Hand of Ulster.

===Decline and legacy===
The BUF became more antisemitic over 1934–35 owing to the growing influence of Nazi sympathisers within the party, such as William Joyce and John Beckett, which provoked the resignation of members such as Robert Forgan. This antisemitic emphasis and these high-profile resignations resulted in a significant decline in membership, dropping to below 8,000 by the end of 1935, and, ultimately, Mosley shifted the party&#x27;s focus back to mainstream politics. There were frequent and continuous violent clashes between BUF party members and anti-fascist protesters, most famously at the Battle of Cable Street in October 1936, when organised anti-fascists prevented the BUF from marching through Cable Street. However, the party later staged other marches through the East End without incident, albeit not on Cable Street itself.

BUF support for Edward VIII and the peace campaign to prevent a second World War saw membership and public support rise once more. The government was sufficiently concerned by the party&#x27;s growing prominence to pass the Public Order Act 1936, which banned political uniforms and required police consent for political marches.

In 1937, William Joyce and other Nazi sympathisers split from the party to form the National Socialist League, which quickly folded, with most of its members interned. Mosley later denounced Joyce as a traitor and condemned him for his extreme antisemitism. The historian Stephen Dorril revealed in his book &quot;Blackshirts&quot; that secret envoys from the Nazis had donated about £50,000 to the BUF.

By 1939, total BUF membership had declined to just 20,000. On 23 May 1940, Mosley and some 740 other party members were interned under Defence Regulation 18B. The BUF then called on its followers to resist invasion, but it was declared unlawful on 10 July 1940 and ceased its activities.

After the war, Mosley made several unsuccessful attempts to return to political life, one such being through the Union Movement, but he had no successes.

==Relationship with the suffragettes==
Attracted by &quot;modern&quot; fascist policies, such as ending the widespread practice of sacking women from their jobs on marriage, many women joined the Blackshirts – particularly in economically depressed Lancashire. Eventually women constituted one-quarter of the BUF&#x27;s membership.

In a January 2010 BBC documentary, &quot;Mother Was A Blackshirt&quot;, James Maw reported that in 1914 Norah Elam was placed in a Holloway Prison cell with Emmeline Pankhurst for her involvement with the suffragette movement, and, in 1940, she was returned to the same prison with Diana Mosley, this time for her involvement with the fascist movement. Another leading suffragette, Mary Richardson, became head of the women&#x27;s section of the BUF.

Mary Sophia Allen OBE was a former branch leader of the West of England Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU). At the outbreak of the First World War, she joined the Women Police Volunteers, becoming the WPV Commandant in 1920. She met Mosley at the January Club in April 1932, going on to speak at the club following her visit to Germany, &quot;to learn the truth about of the position of German womanhood&quot;.

The BBC report described how Elam&#x27;s fascist philosophy grew from her suffragette experiences, how the British fascist movement became largely driven by women, how they targeted young women from an early age, how the first British fascist movement was founded by a woman, and how the leading lights of the suffragettes had, with Oswald Mosley, founded the BUF.

Mosley&#x27;s electoral strategy had been to prepare for the election after 1935, and in 1936 he announced a list of BUF candidates for that election, with Elam nominated to stand for Northampton. Mosley accompanied Elam to Northampton to introduce her to her electorate at a meeting in the Town Hall. At that meeting Mosley announced that &quot;he was glad indeed to have the opportunity of introducing the first candidate, and ... [thereby] killed for all time the suggestion that National Socialism proposed putting British women back into the home; this is simply not true. Mrs Elam [he went on] had fought in the past for women&#x27;s suffrage ... and was a great example of the emancipation of women in Britain.&quot;

Former suffragettes were drawn to the BUF for a variety of reasons. Many felt the movement&#x27;s energy reminded them of the suffragettes, while others felt the BUF&#x27;s economic policies would offer them true equality – unlike its continental counterparts, the movement insisted it would not require women to return to domesticity and that the corporatist state would ensure adequate representation for housewives, while it would also guarantee equal wages for women and remove the marriage bar that restricted the employment of married women. The BUF also offered support for new mothers (due to concerns of falling birth rates), while also offering effective birth control, as Mosley believed it was not in the national interest to have a populace ignorant of modern scientific knowledge. While these policies were motivated more out of making the best use of women&#x27;s skills in state interest than any kind of feminism, it was still a draw for many suffragettes.

==Prominent members and supporters==

Despite the short period of its operation the BUF attracted prominent members and supporters. These included:
* Mary Sophia Allen was a suffragette.

* David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale, was a member of the House of Lords. His wife, Lady Redesdale, and two of his daughters were also members:
** Diana Mitford (Lady Mosley, after her marriage to Sir Oswald Mosley in 1936)
** Unity Mitford was an associate of Hitler.
* Tommy Moran was a BUF leader in Derby and later south Wales.
* Mary Richardson was a suffragette and head of the BUF&#x27;s women&#x27;s section.

==In popular culture==

* The Channel 4 television serial &quot;Mosley&quot; (1998) portrayed the career of Oswald Mosley during his years with the BUF. The four-part series was based on the books &quot;Rules of the Game&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Pale&quot;, written by his son Nicholas Mosley.
* In the film &quot;It Happened Here&quot; (1964), the BUF appears to be the ruling party of German-occupied Britain. A Mosley speech is heard on the radio in the scene before everyone goes to the cinema.
* The first depiction of Mosley and the BUF in fiction occurred in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s novel &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; (1932), in which Mosley is depicted as Everard Webley, the murderous leader of the &quot;BFF&quot;, the Brotherhood of Free Fascists; he comes to a nasty end.
* The BUF has been featured in several novels by Harry Turtledove.
** In his alternative history novel &quot;In the Presence of Mine Enemies&quot;, set in 2010 in a world in which the Nazis were triumphant, the BUF led by Prime Minister Charlie Lynton governs Britain. It is here that the first stirrings of the reform movement appear.
** In the &quot;Southern Victory&quot; series, set in a reality in which the Confederate States of America became independent and the Central Powers (including the United States) won that reality&#x27;s analogue of the First World War, the &quot;Silver Shirts&quot; (analogous to the BUF) entered into a coalition with the Conservatives who were led by Churchill with Mosley being appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.
** The BUF and Mosley also appear as background influences in Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;Colonization&quot; trilogy which follows the Worldwar tetralogy and is set in the 1960s.
* James Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;&#x27;48&quot; (1996) has a protagonist who is hunted by BUF Blackshirts in a devastated London after a biological weapon is released during the Second World War. The history of the BUF and Mosley is recapitulated.
* In Ken Follett&#x27;s novel &quot;Night Over Water&quot;, several of the main characters are BUF members. In his book &quot;Winter of the World&quot;, the Battle of Cable Street plays a role and some of the characters are involved in either the BUF or the anti-BUF organisations.
* The BUF also appears in Guy Walters&#x27; book &quot;The Leader&quot; (2003), in which Mosley is the dictator of Britain in the 1930s.
* The British humorous writer P. G. Wodehouse satirized the BUF in books and short stories. The BUF was satirized as &quot;The Black Shorts&quot;, rather than &quot;shirts&quot;, because all of the best shirt colours were already taken. Its leader was Roderick Spode, the owner of a ladies&#x27; underwear shop.
* The British novelist Nancy Mitford satirized the BUF and Mosley in &quot;Wigs on the Green&quot; (1935). Diana Mitford, the author&#x27;s sister, had been romantically involved with Mosley since 1932.
* In the 1992 Acorn Media production of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot; with David Suchet and Philip Jackson, one of the supporting characters (played by Christopher Eccleston) secures a paid position as a rank-and-file member of the BUF.
* The BUF and Oswald Mosley are alluded to in Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s novel &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;.

<text>Richard Thompson (born 3 April 1949) is an English singer, songwriter, and guitarist.

Thompson first gained prominence in the late 1960s as the lead guitarist and songwriter for the folk rock group Fairport Convention, which he had co-founded in 1967. After departing the group in 1971, Thompson released his debut solo album &quot;Henry the Human Fly&quot; in 1972. The next year, he formed a duo with his wife Linda Thompson, which produced six albums, including the critically acclaimed &quot;I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight&quot; (1974) and &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; (1982). After the dissolution of the duo, Thompson revived his solo career with the release of &quot;Hand of Kindness&quot; in 1983. He has released eighteen solo studio albums. Three of his albums&quot;Rumor and Sigh&quot; (1991), &quot;You? Me? Us?&quot; (1996), and &quot;Dream Attic&quot; (2010)have been nominated for Grammy Awards, while &quot;Still&quot; (2015) was his first UK Top Ten album. He continues to write and record new material and has frequently performed at venues throughout the world, although the COVID-19 pandemic forced him to suspend his touring.

Music critic Neil McCormick described Thompson as &quot;a versatile virtuoso guitarist and a sharp observational singer-songwriter whose work burns with intelligence and dark emotion&quot;. His songwriting has earned him an Ivor Novello Award and, in 2006, a lifetime achievement award from BBC Radio. His 1991 song &quot;1952 Vincent Black Lightning&quot; was included in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;All-TIME 100 Songs&quot; list of the best English-language musical compositions released between 1923 and 2011. Thompson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music. Many varied musicians have recorded Thompson&#x27;s compositions.

His memoir, &quot;Beeswing: Losing My Way and Finding My Voice, 1967–1975&quot;, was published in 2021.

==Early life and career (1949 to 1972)==
Richard Thompson was born at 23 Ladbroke Crescent (off Ladbroke Grove), Notting Hill, West London, England. His father, a Scot, was a Scotland Yard detective and an amateur guitar player; several other family members had played music professionally. He was the younger brother, by five years, of sister Perri, who became a fashion designer. While attending William Ellis School in Highgate, he formed his first band, Emil and the Detectives (named after a book and a movie by the same title), with classmate Hugh Cornwell, later lead singer and guitarist of the Stranglers, on bass guitar. When he was a teenager Thompson moved with his family to Whetstone, near the end of the underground&#x27;s Northern line.

Interviewed in 2003, Thompson said:
Like so many musicians of his generation, Thompson was exposed to and embraced rock and roll music at an early age, and he was also exposed to his father&#x27;s jazz and traditional Scottish music record collection. His father had seen Django Reinhardt play in Glasgow in the 1930s and played guitar himself. He was later described by his son as &quot;a bad amateur player ... with three chords, though, unfortunately, not C, F and G.&quot; All these musical genres were to colour Thompson&#x27;s playing in the years to come.

American producer Joe Boyd said:
At the age of 18 Thompson co-founded folk rock group Fairport Convention. Largely on the strength of Thompson&#x27;s playing, Boyd took them under his wing and signed them to his Witchseason production and management company.

Boyd said:
Shortly thereafter Thompson, already acquiring a reputation as an outstanding guitar player, started writing songs seriously. This seems to have been out of necessity as Fairport Convention was at first essentially a cover band.

By early 1969, when Fairport&#x27;s second album &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot; was recorded and released, Thompson was starting to emerge as a songwriter of distinction. As Fairport&#x27;s lineup and their sound evolved, Thompson continued to grow in stature as a player and as a songwriter with compositions like &quot;Meet on the Ledge&quot;.
On 12 May 1969, between the recording and release of their next album &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;, Fairport&#x27;s van crashed on the M1 motorway on the way home from a gig at Mothers, a club in Birmingham. Drummer Martin Lamble, aged 19, and Thompson&#x27;s girlfriend Jeannie Franklyn were killed. The rest of the band suffered injuries of varying severity. Later in 1969, Fairport re-grouped with a new drummer, Dave Mattacks, and also invited the well known fiddle player, Dave Swarbrick, to join. Thompson and Swarbrick worked together to create songs such as &quot;Crazy Man Michael&quot; from the band&#x27;s seminal 1969 folk-rock album &quot;Liege &amp; Lief&quot; and &quot;Sloth&quot; from its 1970 follow-up &quot;Full House&quot;.

In January 1971, Thompson announced that he was leaving Fairport Convention. His decision was instinctive, rather than a calculated career move:

In April 1972, he released his first solo album &quot;Henry the Human Fly&quot;, recording with Sandy Denny, Pat Donaldson, Sue Draheim, John Kirkpatrick, Barry Dransfield, Ashley Hutchings, Linda Peters, Andy Roberts, and others. The album sold poorly and was panned by the press, especially the influential &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine. With time &quot;Henry&quot; has come to be more highly regarded, but at the time the critics&#x27; response hurt both Thompson and his career.

==1970s: Richard and Linda Thompson==
By the 1970s, Thompson had begun a relationship with the singer Linda Peters, who had sung on &quot;Henry the Human Fly&quot;. In October 1972 the couple were married at Hampstead Town Hall and honeymooned in Corsica. Thompson, with Linda now effectively his front woman, regrouped for his next album and the next phase of his career.

The first Richard and Linda Thompson album, &quot;I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight&quot;, was recorded in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain and its impact on the availability of vinyl for records, &quot;Bright Lights&quot; was held back by Island Records for nearly a year before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by critics, though sales were less than stellar.

Thompson&#x27;s lyrics expressed a rather dismal world view, and it has been suggested that the bleak subject matter of his songs helped to keep his recordings off the hit parade. A more likely explanation was given by ex-Island A&amp;R man Richard Williams in the 2003 BBC TV documentary &quot;Solitary Life&quot;: Thompson was just not interested in fame and its trappings.

The Thompsons recorded two more albums—&quot;Hokey Pokey&quot; and &quot;Pour Down Like Silver&quot;, both released in 1975—before Richard Thompson decided to leave the music business. The couple moved to a Sufi community in East Anglia.

It was not apparent from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric Sufi strand of Islam in early 1974. &quot;I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight&quot; was recorded before this conversion, but released some time afterwards. The songs for the second Richard and Linda album, &quot;Hokey Pokey&quot;, were similarly written some time ahead of the album&#x27;s recording and eventual release. It was &quot;Pour Down Like Silver&quot;, with its cover photo of a turbaned Richard Thompson, that tipped the public off to the Thompsons&#x27; growing preoccupation with their faith.

The trilogy of albums released before and after his sojourn in the commune was heavily influenced by Thompson&#x27;s beliefs and by Sufi scripture, but in the long run his religious beliefs have not influenced his work in an obvious manner. The outlook expressed in his songs, his musical style, the subjects addressed by his lyrics have not shown any fundamental change. He remains a committed Muslim.

Thompson started to re-engage with the world of professional music in 1977. He played on an album by Sandy Denny, and had undertaken a short tour and started recording with a group of musicians who were also Sufis. Thompson asked Joe Boyd to produce these sessions, and two days were spent on the initial recordings. Boyd recalls that the sessions were not a success: &quot;It was really, I felt, very poor. I didn&#x27;t have much confidence in the musicians that he was working with. The atmosphere was very strange and it just didn&#x27;t seem to work.&quot;

At about this time the Thompsons and their family moved out of the commune and back to their old home in Hampstead. Boyd had already invited Richard Thompson to play on Julie Covington&#x27;s debut album. With spare studio time and the American session musicians hired to work on the Covington album available, the Thompsons went back into the studio to record under their own name for the first time in three years.

The resulting album, &quot;First Light&quot;, was warmly received by critics but did not sell particularly well. Neither did its follow up, 1979&#x27;s harder-edged and more cynical &quot;Sunnyvista&quot;. Chrysalis Records did not take up their option to renew the contract, and the Thompsons found themselves without one.

==1980s==

Gerry Rafferty had booked the Thompsons as the support act for his 1980 tour, and had also used Richard as a session player on his &quot;Night Owl&quot; album. Rafferty offered to finance the recording of a new Richard and Linda Thompson album which he would then use to secure a contract for the Thompsons. Richard Thompson fell out with Rafferty during this project and was not happy with the finished product. Nevertheless, Rafferty kept his side of the bargain and presented the album to several record companies – none of which expressed interest in signing the Thompsons. Rafferty did not recover his investment.

About a year later, Joe Boyd signed the Thompsons to his small Hannibal label and a new album was recorded. &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; included new recordings of many of the songs recorded in 1980. Linda Thompson was pregnant at the time of the recording, so the album&#x27;s release was delayed until they could tour behind the album. Breathing problems arising from her pregnancy also meant that Linda could not sing the lead part on some of these songs as she had done on demo tapes and the Rafferty-produced recordings.

As an interim measure, Richard Thompson agreed to a short (5-day), low-key solo tour of the U.S. This tour was set up by Nancy Covey, then concert director for McCabe&#x27;s Guitar Shop in Santa Monica. Covey, who had been in the UK in 1981 trying to sign Thompson to play at McCabe&#x27;s, arranged for Thompson well-received 5 and 6 December shows. It was during this tour that Thompson and Covey developed an intimate relationship, and during that month, Richard and Linda Thompson separated.

Upon its release in 1982, &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; was lauded by critics and sold quite well – especially in the U.S.

The Thompsons, now a couple for professional purposes only, toured the United States in support of the album, their only American tour together. Both the album and their live shows were well received by the American media, and &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; effectively relaunched their career – just as their marriage was falling apart. The performances, with a backing band including both Simon Nicol and Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention, were seen as strong, but the tension between Richard and Linda was all too obvious. For this reason, the Thompsons&#x27; fans often refer to the &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot; tour as &quot;The Tour from Hell&quot;. Upon returning home, Richard and Linda went their separate ways.

Richard Thompson continued recording as a solo artist. His 1983 album &quot;Hand of Kindness&quot; saw him working with Boyd again, but with a revised backing band and a more extroverted and up-tempo song selection.

With his separation from Linda finalized, Richard Thompson began to commute between twin bases in London and Los Angeles and to tour regularly in the USA. Encouraged by the success of his solo shows in late 1981 and early 1982, he began to perform solo with increasing frequency and continued to tour with a band. In 1983 and 1984, he toured the US and Europe with the Richard Thompson Big Band, which included two saxophone players in addition to the more usual rhythm section, second guitar and accordion. Set lists included covers of classic rock &#x27;n roll songs and jazz standards such as &quot;Tuxedo Junction&quot;.

In 1985, Thompson signed with PolyGram and received a sizeable advance. He and Nancy Covey married at an alcohol-free wedding that included a who&#x27;s who of roots-music performers who Covey knew well from McCabe&#x27;s and the Los Angeles music scene, and had introduced to Thompson. After their wedding, Thompson moved his home and working base to California. As part of the settlement that allowed Thompson to leave Boyd&#x27;s Hannibal label for Polygram, the live album &quot;Small Town Romance&quot; was released. This comprised recordings made during Thompson&#x27;s solo shows in the US in late 1981 and early 1982. &quot;Across a Crowded Room&quot; (1985) was his last album to be recorded in England and the last to have Boyd as producer. Thompson put together a new look backing band for the tour to promote this album, and some shows were filmed for a live video release (see Richard Thompson discography).

In 1986, he released &quot;Daring Adventures&quot;, which was recorded in Los Angeles and produced by Mitchell Froom. &quot;Daring Adventures&quot;, with a rich sound, markedly different production and use of American session players, was perceived by some as evidence of Thompson&#x27;s increasing &quot;Americanisation&quot;. Perhaps more significantly, the album continued the trend, begun with &quot;Across A Crowded Room,&quot; of Thompson&#x27;s songs moving away from the seemingly personal material and towards the character sketches and narratives for which he has since become famous. Froom and PolyGram had plans to target college and the growing &quot;alternative&quot; markets with &quot;Daring Adventures&quot;. Sales improved, but not substantially. Polygram declined an option to renew the contract. Thompson&#x27;s management negotiated a new deal with Capitol Records.

In 1985, Fairport Convention reformed and recorded the album &quot;Gladys&#x27; Leap&quot;. Thompson did not rejoin Fairport, but he did contribute a song to the project and played guitar on another track on the album.

1988 saw the release of Thompson&#x27;s first album for Capitol, &quot;Amnesia&quot;. Froom was retained as producer, and once again the album was recorded in Los Angeles with many of the same players that Froom had called upon for the &quot;Daring Adventures&quot; sessions.

==1990s==
Thompson contributed music to BBC Northwest&#x27;s documentary &quot;Hard Cash&quot; and appears on the eponymous accompanying album issued by Topic. A track from the album, &quot;Time To Ring Some Changes&quot; is included in the 2009 Topic Records 70-year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot; as track thirteen on the sixth CD.

Thompson appears on Willie Nile&#x27;s 1991 &quot;Places I Have Never Been&quot; album.

In 1991, Thompson recorded &quot;Rumor and Sigh&quot;, his second album for Capitol. Once again Froom produced. This album, particularly the acoustic guitar ballad &quot;1952 Vincent Black Lightning&quot;, was hailed by critics and fans alike and greatly advanced Thompson&#x27;s reputation as a leading traditional-style guitarist.

&quot;Rumor and Sigh&quot; was nominated for a Grammy and sold well. However, a shake-up at Capitol saw Hale Milgrim (Thompson&#x27;s champion and fan within the boardroom) replaced by Garry Gersh. Thus, Thompson&#x27;s next album &quot;Mirror Blue&quot; was held back for almost a year before being released.

Thompson was awarded the Orville H. Gibson Award for best acoustic guitar player in 1997.

In 1992, he performed with David Byrne. Their joint acoustic concert at St. Ann &amp; The Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights, New York on 24 March, produced the album &quot;An Acoustic Evening&quot;, which was released the same year.

&quot;Mirror Blue&quot; was released in 1994, to often negative reviews sparked by the production decisions that Thompson and Froom took. Thompson took to the road to promote the album. He was joined by drummer Dave Mattacks, Danny Thompson (no relation) on double bass, and Pete Zorn on acoustic guitar, backing vocals, mandolin and various wind instruments. This line-up toured with Thompson the following two years.

Thompson continued recording for Capitol until 1999, when &quot;Mock Tudor&quot; was recorded and released. His deal with Capitol was modified so that he could release and directly market limited-quantity, live recorded, not-for-retail albums. The first of these was &quot;Live at Crawley&quot;, released in 1995.

In 1994 the tribute album &quot;Beat the Retreat&quot; was issued, with Thompson&#x27;s songs performed by such artists as R.E.M., June Tabor and David Byrne.

==2000s==

In 2001, Thompson declined the option to renew his contract with Capitol.

Thompson appeared on his ex-wife Linda&#x27;s studio album &quot;Fashionably Late&quot; on the song &quot;Dear Mary&quot;. It was the first time the two had recorded together since &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot;.

In 2003, the BBC produced a documentary about Thompson&#x27;s long musical career, entitled &quot;Solitary Life&quot;, directed by Paul Bernays and narrated by John Peel. It featured interviews with Thompson from his home in California and contributions from Billy Connolly, Bonnie Raitt, ex-wife Linda Thompson, Harry Shearer and Thompson&#x27;s then wife Nancy Covey. The programme was re-broadcast by BBC Four in September 2012.

The move away from big labels and big budgets paradoxically brought a bigger marketing push and healthier sales. Thompson&#x27;s first two self-funded releases, 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Old Kit Bag&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Front Parlour Ballads&quot;, did well in the indie charts on both sides of the Atlantic. In May 2007 Thompson released &quot;Sweet Warrior&quot;. The album was licensed to different labels in different territories: Shout! Factory in the US, P-Vine in Japan, Planet Records in Australia, and Proper Records in the UK and Europe. In August of the same year Island released a live Richard and Linda Thompson album, compiled from recordings made during the November 1975 tour to promote the &quot;Pour Down Like Silver&quot; album.

Thompson continued releasing &quot;official bootlegs&quot; on his boutique label as an additional source of revenue – all live recordings.

==2010s==

In early 2010, Thompson assembled a band and did a string of shows showcasing new material. The aim was to record the new material in a live setting. The recording and touring band consisted of Thompson, Pete Zorn, (acoustic guitar, flute, saxophone, mandolin, vocals); Michael Jerome (drums, vocals), Taras Prodaniuk, (bass guitar, vocals); and Joel Zifkin, (electric violin, mandolin, vocals). The resulting album &quot;Dream Attic&quot;, released in August the same year, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album.

On 10 June 2010, Thompson was awarded the &quot;Mojo&quot; Les Paul Award for &quot;Guitar Legend&quot;.

Thompson curated the 2010 Meltdown Festival. The festival included a tribute to the recently deceased Kate McGarrigle, a feature of which was a rare on-stage reunion of Richard and Linda Thompson. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to music. On 5 July 2011, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen.

In early 2013, Thompson released &quot;Electric&quot;, recorded in Nashville with Buddy Miller producing. The record enjoyed good reviews and debuted in the UK top 20. Thompson took to the road with a stripped-down &quot;power trio&quot; band on a multi-month tour on both sides of the Atlantic to promote the new album. Also that year Thompson appeared on his ex-wife Linda&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Won&#x27;t Be Long Now&quot;, on the track &quot;Love&#x27;s for Babies and Fools&quot;. It was the second time the two have recorded together since &quot;Shoot Out the Lights&quot;.

In 2014, Thompson released &quot;Acoustic Classics,&quot; an album featuring acoustic renditions of 14 songs from his back catalogue, on his Beeswing label. The record reached number 16 on the UK Albums Chart. Thompson appears alongside family members, both blood related and by marriage, on the album &quot;Family&quot; (2014) by Thompson (the band being named for all the Thompsons that appear), performing two songs solo and contributing to others as well. The album was produced by son Teddy Thompson and features ex-wife Linda Thompson, The Rails who are Thompson&#x27;s daughter Kami Thompson and her husband James Walbourne, as well as other related musicians, including Walbourne&#x27;s brother and Richard Thompson&#x27;s son from his second marriage.

Thompson released &quot;Still&quot; in June 2015, an album produced by Jeff Tweedy of Wilco and recorded in Tweedy&#x27;s The Loft Studio. The album reached number 10 in the UK Album chart, his first album to reach the UK top 10. In September 2015, he appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, where he performed &quot;All Buttoned Up&quot; and &quot;&quot;She Never Could Resist a Winding Road&quot; from his album &quot;Still&quot;. This was followed, in 2017, by a second acoustic album &quot;Acoustic Classics II&quot; which reached number 24 on the UK Albums Chart. and &quot;Acoustic Rarities&quot;, an album of new recordings of some of the more obscure songs in the Thompson catalogue, some previously existing only as cover versions.

Thompson&#x27;s eighteenth studio album, &quot;13 Rivers&quot;, was released on 14 September 2018. It was written after a period of difficulty for Thompson&#x27;s family with songs that stick &quot;close to a vision of darkness, gloom, and noise&quot;. Thompson produced the record himself at Boulevard Recording in Los Angeles. On 30 September 2019 Thompson played at the Royal Albert Hall to celebrate his 70th birthday.

In July 2019 Thompson was featured in the BBC Four documentary &quot;Classic Albums: The Crickets: The &#x27;Chirping&#x27; Crickets&quot;, explaining the influence that Buddy Holly had had on him personally, and on the development of rock and roll in general.

==2020s==
In 2021 his book &quot;Beeswing: Losing My Way and Finding My Voice, 1967–1975&quot; was published by Algonquin Books, mainly a memoir of his life as a musician from 1967 to 1975. The &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; called it an &quot;absorbing, witty, often deliciously biting read, as all rock memoirs should be&quot;.

Thompson performed on the acoustic stage of the Glastonbury Festival in June 2023. Reviewing the set for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Keza MacDonald said, &quot;It&#x27;s just him and a beautiful, bright-sounding acoustic guitar. He plays so well that you can&#x27;t take your eyes off his picking hand, as you try to figure out how he&#x27;s making the sound of three guitars come out of one. He is one of the most stunningly gifted guitarists you&#x27;ll ever see live, and his dextrously fingerpicked mid-song diversions prompt claps and whoops from a crowd that is otherwise quietly reverent.&quot;

In January 2024 Thompson announced a band tour of the U.S. and U.K., with the British leg culminating in a date at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 8 June. &quot;Ship to Shore&quot; was released that May. Reviewing the concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall for &quot;The Times&quot;, Peter Ross awarded the gig four stars and said, &quot;There were flashes of brilliance, however. &quot;Guns Are the Tongues&quot;, with Hobbs on mandolin, built over seven minutes to an ecstatic darkness. &quot;Dimming of the Day&quot; had a gentle grace. Best of all was &quot;Beeswing&quot;, which Thompson performed alone, fingerpicking an acoustic. Intricate and soulful, it&#x27;s a song in which his technical ability and poetic voice are held in balance. The brief silence that followed said more than any applause could; we knew we&#x27;d heard something exquisite.&quot; The final night, at the Royal Albert Hall, featured guest artists including Ralph McTell, James Walbourne, Kami Thompson, Linda Thompson, Squeeze and Crowded House. On 9 August Thompson headlined the second night of the annual Cropredy Festival.

In 2020 the 1969 album &quot;Dudu Phukwana and the &quot;Spears&quot;&quot;, the debut album by South African saxophonist Dudu Pukwana and his band, produced by Joe Boyd, was remastered and reissued by Matsuli Music as a double-LP set with nine previously unissued tracks that were recorded in 1969, and which feature a number of guest artists such as Thompson and Simon Nicol.

In October 2023 Thompson released the instrumental &quot;Lament For Mariupol&quot; as part of the charity compilation album &quot;Heal the Sky&quot; which aimed to raise funds to help children who were victims of the war in Ukraine.

==Side projects and collaborations==
In between leaving Fairport Convention in early 1971 and releasing his debut solo album in 1972, he undertook a large amount of session work, most notably on albums by John Martyn, Al Stewart, Matthews Southern Comfort, Sandy Denny, Mike Heron and Nick Drake.

During the same period, he also worked on two collaborative projects. &quot;Morris On&quot; was recorded with Ashley Hutchings, John Kirkpatrick, Dave Mattacks and Barry Dransfield, and was a collection of English traditional tunes arranged for electric instruments. &quot;The Bunch&quot; were almost the reverse conceptually – a grouping of English folk rock musicians (including Sandy Denny, Linda Peters and members of Fairport Convention) recording a selection of classic rock and roll tunes.

Thompson has continued to guest on albums by an array of artists, from Crowded House, Bonnie Raitt and Vivian Stanshall, to Norma Waterson and BeauSoleil and folk artists like Loudon Wainwright III, Cathal McConnell (of The Boys of the Lough) and Bob Davenport. He has also performed and recorded with Teddy Thompson, his son from his marriage to Linda Thompson.
Since the early 1980s, Thompson has appeared at Fairport Convention&#x27;s annual Cropredy Festival, both in his own right and as a participant in sets with current and former Fairport members. These sets are seldom confined to performances of songs out of the Thompson or Fairport Convention canons, and in recent years some surprise offerings have included the soul classic &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (with Thompson backed by the Roy Wood Big Band), The Beatles&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot; and even &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;.

Thompson has displayed a penchant for the avant garde as well, working with former Pere Ubu singer David Thomas&#x27;s grouping The Pedestrians on two albums in 1981 and 1982, respectively. In the 1980s, he was associated with a loose-fitting group called The Golden Palominos, who were led by drummer Anton Fier and included at times on stage and on record Jack Bruce, Michael Stipe, Carla Bley, John Lydon, Bill Laswell and others. He has worked with experimental guitarist Henry Kaiser, most notably as part of the ad hoc grouping French Frith Kaiser Thompson with whom he recorded two albums. In 1997 he worked with long-time friend and band member Danny Thompson to record a concept album &quot;Industry&quot; that dealt with the decline of British industry. A year later he worked with early music expert Philip Pickett on the acclaimed &quot;Bones of All Men&quot; which fused renaissance tunes with contemporary music.

For several years Thompson devised and toured his show &quot;1000 Years of Popular Music&quot;. The inspiration for this came when &quot;Playboy&quot; asked Thompson (and many other music industry figures) in 1999 for their suggestions for the &quot;top ten songs of the millennium&quot;. Guessing that &quot;Playboy&quot; expected most people&#x27;s lists to start at around 1950, Thompson took the magazine at its word and presented a list of songs from the 11th century to the present day. Perhaps not surprisingly, &quot;Playboy&quot; did not use his list, but the exercise gave him the idea for a show which takes a chronological trip through popular music across the ages. Thompson acknowledges that this is an ambitious undertaking, partly because he reckons that he is technically unqualified to sing 98% of the material, and partly because of the sparse musical setting he restricts himself to: besides his acoustic guitar, he&#x27;s backed by singer/pianist Judith Owen and percussionist/singer Debra Dobkin. A typical performance would start with a medieval round, progress via a Purcell aria, Victorian music hall and Hoagy Carmichael and end with Thompson&#x27;s take on the Britney Spears hit &quot;Oops!... I Did It Again&quot;.

In 2004 Thompson was asked to create the soundtrack music for the Werner Herzog documentary &quot;Grizzly Man&quot;. The score, which was recorded over a two-day period in December 2004, brought Thompson together with a group of improvisational musicians, mostly from the San Francisco Bay area; video footage from the sessions was edited into a mini-documentary, &quot;In the Edges,&quot; which was included with the DVD release of &quot;Grizzly Man&quot;.

In 2009 Thompson was commissioned to write a piece for the International Society of Bassists in honour of Danny Thompson. The resulting &quot;Cabaret of Souls&quot;, a musical play set in the underworld, has been performed in State College, Pennsylvania, London, and Los Angeles with a cast that includes Harry Shearer, Judith Owen, Debra Dobkin, Pete Zorn, either Danny Thompson or David Piltch, and a 12-piece string section conducted by Peter Askim. This suite was eventually commercially released in late 2012.

In 2006 and 2013, Thompson recorded Hugh S. Roberton&#x27;s &quot;Mingulay Boat Song&quot; and the traditional &quot;General Taylor&quot; for the sea shanty-compilations &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs, and Chanteys&quot; and &quot;Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs &amp; Chanteys&quot;.

In July 2019, New West Records released a soundtrack album for the documentary &quot;The Cold Blue&quot;, featuring the film&#x27;s original score composed by Thompson. The film, directed by Erik Nelson, focuses on the Eighth Air Force. It uses footage taken by director William Wyler for his 1944 documentary &quot;Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress&quot;.

==Retrospectives and tributes==
There are a number of retrospective collections of Thompson&#x27;s work, many containing material which is unavailable elsewhere. 1976&#x27;s &quot;(guitar, vocal)&quot; was a collection of unreleased material from the previous eight years of Thompson&#x27;s appearances on the Island label. The 3-CD set &quot;Watching the Dark&quot; combines his better-known songs and previously unreleased live and studio tracks. &quot;Action Packed&quot; is a compilation of tracks from his Capitol releases, plus three hard-to-find songs. Finally, in 2006, the independent label Free Reed released &quot;RT- The Life and Music of Richard Thompson&quot;, a 5-CD box set consisting almost entirely of previously unreleased performances of songs from throughout Thompson&#x27;s long career.

Thompson&#x27;s songs have been extensively covered; for example, Dimming of the Day has been performed by artists such as The Neville Brothers, Bonnie Raitt, Emmylou Harris, David Gilmour, The Blind Boys of Alabama, June Tabor, The Corrs and Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station. There have been several tribute compilations of other artists&#x27; interpretations of his work, including: Capitol&#x27;s &quot;Beat the Retreat: Songs by Richard Thompson&quot; and Green Linnet&#x27;s &quot;The World Is a Wonderful Place: The Songs of Richard Thompson&quot;, both released in 1994.

==Playing style==
Thompson makes use of the &quot;pick and fingers&quot; technique (sometimes referred to as &quot;hybrid picking&quot;) where he plays bass notes and rhythm with a pick between his first finger and thumb, and adds melody and punctuation by plucking the treble strings with his fingers. He also makes use of different guitar tunings, such as (low to high) CGDGBE, DADGBE, DADGAD, and more. This enables him to adapt traditional songs, as on &quot;Strict Tempo!&quot; and &quot;1000 Years of Popular Music&quot;. Thompson occasionally makes use of a thumb-pick, playing in fingerstyle, the most notable example being on the motorcycle ballad &quot;1952 Vincent Black Lightning&quot;.

==Guitars==
===Electric===
Thompson is often associated with the Fender Stratocaster guitar. He has made prominent use of Stratocasters, as he has a general preference for the sound of single coil pick-ups.

Prior to using a Stratocaster with Fairport Convention he used a Gibson Les Paul with P-90 pick-ups. He then switched to a late 60s Stratocaster. Since leaving Fairport Convention he has continued to use electric guitars with single coil pick-ups, most famously a late-1950s Stratocaster but also two custom built electrics by Danny Ferrington as well as other Stratocasters, various Telecaster-type guitars and, in the studio, a Danelectro U2.

As regards effects, he has made significant use of modulation and vibrato type effects pedals, most notably the Univibe and emulations thereof.

Thompson has made intermittent use of Roland&#x27;s GK-1 pick-up and GL-2 synthesiser over the years. He made use of these devices on 1979&#x27;s &quot;Sunnyvista&quot; album and has occasionally used them in concert.

===Acoustic===
Since the early 1990s, Thompson has made prominent use of Lowden acoustic guitars for studio and live work; Lowden have made a signature model for him. Before this he used a Martin 000-18 as well as instruments built by Danny Ferrington.

For live work, his acoustic guitars are fitted with a Sunrise pick-up and an internal condenser microphone. The output from the pick-up is usually fed into some effects pedals, typically a delay pedal and a Uni-Vibe.

==Personal life==

Thompson had his first son, Jesse, in the early 1970s with American tour booker Liz Gordon after a brief relationship.

In the early 1970s, Thompson began a relationship with the singer Linda Peters, who sang on Thompson&#x27;s album &quot;Henry the Human Fly&quot;. In October 1972 the couple were married at Hampstead Town Hall. The couple worked as a duo and have three children: Muna Thompson and the musicians Teddy Thompson and Kamila Thompson. Richard and Linda Thompson separated in 1982. 

Richard Thompson married Nancy Covey in 1985, and was with Covey until they separated in 2018. Thompson and Covey have a son, Jack Covey Thompson, a musician and visual artist who lives in London and has recorded with Henry Kaiser, Cuban musician Yelfris Valdez, and the Thompson family.

In 2021, Richard Thompson married his third wife, the author, actor, singer and songwriter Zara Philips with whom he lives in New Jersey. They contribute to one another&#x27;s musical projects.

In 2024 his touring band for the album &quot;Ship to Shore&quot; included Thompson&#x27;s grandson (Muna&#x27;s son) Zak Hobbs.

<text>Sandra Julia Gidley MRPharmS (&quot;née&quot; Rawson; born 26 March 1957) is a British pharmacist and politician who served as the Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for Romsey in Hampshire from 2000 to 2010, when she lost her seat to Conservative candidate Caroline Nokes.

==Biography==
Born Sandra Julia Rawson in Rosset, Denbighshire in Wales, she was educated at the Eggar&#x27;s Grammar School in Alton, Hampshire; the Afcent International School in Brunssum, Netherlands; and the Windsor Girls&#x27; School in Hamm, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. She finished her education at the University of Bath, where she was awarded a BPharm Diploma in 1978. She became a MRPharmS in 1979.

In 1979 she joined Badham Chemists as a pharmacist in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, until she was appointed as a pharmacy manager with GK Chemists in Gloucester in 1980. She became a locum pharmacist in 1982 before joining Safeway as a supermarket pharmacy manager in 1992, and joined Tesco in the same position in 1999 where she remained until her election to the House of Commons.

On 17 July 2019, Gidley was announced as the first female President of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. She was followed by another woman, Claire Anderson, in 2021.

==Parliamentary career==
She joined the Liberal Democrats in 1994, was elected as a councillor to the Test Valley Borough Council in 1995 and was, in 1997, the youngest ever female mayor of Romsey.

After Romsey&#x27;s Conservative MP Michael Colvin died in a fire at his home in Tangley on 24 February 2000, Gidley was selected as the Liberal Democrat candidate for the resulting by-election. She won the by-election, on 4 May, with a majority of 3,311 votes and won in the 2001 and 2005 general elections. However, in 2005 her majority was reduced to only 125 votes, the smallest of any Lib Dem MP, by the Conservative candidate, Caroline Nokes. She was appointed as the party&#x27;s spokeswoman on women&#x27;s issues and older people from 2001. In January 2006, as Kennedy faced allegations of a drink problem, Gidley was one of 11 members of the front-bench team to write to Kennedy asking him to resign. Gidley chaired her party&#x27;s Gender Balance Task Force, an initiative to get more women into politics.

The Romsey constituency was abolished for the 2010 election, and in the new Romsey and Southampton North constituency she was defeated by the Conservative candidate Caroline Nokes, who took the new seat a majority of 4,165 votes following the expenses scandal, in which it emerged Gidley accepted a £18,700 &#x27;windfall&#x27; from her London landlord in return for an increase in her taxpayer funded rent.

==Criticism of parliamentary expenses==
Gidley was sometimes described as &quot;Hampshire&#x27;s most expensive MP&quot; by her political opponents, claiming £160,000 in 2007/08, and £187,000 in another year, amidst concerns she was using tax payer&#x27;s money to fund her political and re-election campaign. It emerged the tax payer was paying money to her party&#x27;s constituency office, including paying the business rates, £60 for water, over £600 a year on telephones, and £960 on tea, coffee and cleaning. In 2011, her successor, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, claimed £87,000 a year less in expenses than Gidley. However in 2017–2018 Caroline Nokes was claiming £168,297.18 in expenses. 
Whilst an MP, Gidley was claiming £1,638 a month for a luxury flat with indoor swimming pool in London, as well as £420 a month for food, and over £1,000 for Council Tax, and was criticised when it emerged she and three other Lib Dem MPs, accepted a £18,700 cash windfall from the landlord of the Dolphin Square flat, in return for agreeing to an increase in their rent, which was funded by the taxpayer. She was found to have &quot;accepted one-off cash payment from the owners of an apartment block close to Parliament in return for agreeing to pay higher rent levels&quot;. A Parliamentary Committee on Standards and Privileges was critical of Gidley&#x27;s &#x27;serious misjudgment&#x27; in accepting the windfall, said she had broken the rules, and she was forced to apologise for it.

==Return to politics==
Gidley stood unsuccessfully in the 2013 Hampshire County Council election against incumbent Conservative Councillor Roy Perry, former Member of the European Parliament and also the father of Caroline Nokes, the Conservative candidate who defeated her in 2010.

In the 2019 Local Elections, Gidley returned to Test Valley Borough Council as the Councillor for Romsey Abbey ward defeating the Conservative Party incumbent.

==Lord Rennard==
Gidley was her Party&#x27;s Front Bench Spokesperson on Women&#x27;s issues, and Chair of the Lib Dems &#x27;Gender Balance Taskforce&#x27; at the time it emerged the Party&#x27;s Chief Executive, Lord Rennard, was accused of a series of sexual assaults against women. She appeared on the BBC and admitted that the Lib Dems had &#x27;screwed up&#x27;. However, several days later she claimed she had informed party leader Nick Clegg of the concerns over Rennard&#x27;s conduct. Neither Nick Clegg or Sandra Gidley knew of any specific details as stated by Nick Clegg&#x27;s spokesman &quot;Sandra Gidley once raised general concerns with Nick Clegg about Lord Rennard&#x27;s conduct. She did not know of or raise specific allegations.&quot;.

==Personal life==
Gidley and her husband Bill, an electronics engineer, married in 1979 and have lived in Romsey since 1986. They have a daughter, Gemma, and a son, Nick, who both attended local state schools. Gidley was for many years a voluntary antenatal teacher with the National Childbirth Trust and has been involved with many charitable organisations.

She enjoys badminton, and lists reading, cookery and the theatre amongst her hobbies, and is a supporter of Macmillan Cancer Relief.

<text>The University Museum of Bergen () is a university museum in Bergen, Norway. The museum features material related to anthropology, archaeology, botany, geology, zoology, art, and cultural history.

==History==
The University Museum of Bergen was founded in 1825 by Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie, at the time president of the Storting. Founded under the name University Museum of Bergen with the intent of building large collections in the fields of culture and natural history, it became the grounds for most of the academic activity in the city, a tradition which has prevailed since the museum became part of the University of Bergen. The University Museum of Bergen is divided into two departments, the Natural History Collections and the Cultural History Collections and Public Outreach and exhibitions. It is also the caretaker of the museum garden, formerly the botanical garden, surrounding the natural history building, and the city&#x27;s arboretum.

This was the first dedicated museum building in Norway. In its early years, the museum contained numerous art collections, including several works by the painter Johan Christian Dahl, cultural artefacts, and craftwork items. In 1831, the museum moved from its location in the Seminarium Fredericianum building near Bergen Cathedral School (&quot;Bergen katedralskole&quot;), to a new building southwest of Lille Lungegårdsvannet.

The current natural history building was designed by Johan Henrik Nebelong and finished in 1865. Bergen Museum moved in during 1866. The wings of the building were added in 1898 and the botanical garden was laid out between 1897 and 1899. The cultural history department got its own building in 1927. The increasing research activity at the museum from the late 19th century and onward led directly to the founding of the University of Bergen in 1946.

<doc id="177193" wikidata="Q123705" url="?curid=177193" title="Neighbourhood">
<text>A neighbourhood (Commonwealth English) or neighborhood (American English) is a geographically localized community within a larger city, town, suburb or rural area, sometimes consisting of a single street and the buildings lining it. Neighbourhoods are often social communities with considerable face-to-face interaction among members. Researchers have not agreed on an exact definition, but the following may serve as a starting point: &quot;Neighbourhood is generally defined spatially as a specific geographic area and functionally as a set of social networks. Neighbourhoods, then, are the spatial units in which face-to-face social interactions occur—the personal settings and situations where residents seek to realise common values, socialise youth, and maintain effective social control.&quot;

==Preindustrial cities==
In the words of the urban scholar Lewis Mumford, &quot;Neighborhoods, in some annoying, inchoate fashion exist wherever human beings congregate, in permanent family dwellings; and many of the functions of the city tend to be distributed naturally—that is, without any theoretical preoccupation or political direction—into neighborhoods.&quot; Most of the earliest cities around the world as excavated by archaeologists have evidence for the presence of social neighbourhoods. Historical documents shed light on neighbourhood life in numerous historical preindustrial or nonwestern cities.

Neighbourhoods are typically generated by social interaction among people living near one another. In this sense they are local social units larger than households not directly under the control of city or state officials. In some preindustrial urban traditions, basic municipal functions such as protection, social regulation of births and marriages, cleaning and upkeep are handled informally by neighbourhoods and not by urban governments; this pattern is well documented for historical Islamic cities.

In addition to social neighbourhoods, most ancient and historical cities also had administrative districts used by officials for taxation, record-keeping, and social control. Administrative districts are typically larger than neighbourhoods and their boundaries may cut across neighbourhood divisions. In some cases, however, administrative districts coincided with neighbourhoods, leading to a high level of regulation of social life by officials. For example, in the Tang period Chinese capital city Chang&#x27;an, neighbourhoods were districts and there were state officials who carefully controlled life and activity at the neighbourhood level.

Neighbourhoods in preindustrial cities often had some degree of social specialisation or differentiation. Ethnic neighbourhoods were important in many past cities and remain common in cities today. Economic specialists, including craft producers, merchants, and others, could be concentrated in neighbourhoods, and in societies with religious pluralism neighbourhoods were often specialised by religion. One factor contributing to neighbourhood distinctiveness and social cohesion in past cities was the role of rural to urban migration. This was a continual process in preindustrial cities, and migrants tended to move in with relatives and acquaintances from their rural past.

==Sociology==
Neighbourhood sociology is a subfield of urban sociology which studies local communities Neighbourhoods are also used in research studies from postal codes and health disparities, to correlations with school drop out rates or use of drugs. Some attention has also been devoted to viewing the neighbourhood as a small-scale democracy, regulated primarily by ideas of reciprocity among neighbours.

==Improvement==

Neighbourhoods have been the site of service delivery or &quot;service interventions&quot; in part as efforts to provide local, quality services, and to increase the degree of local control and ownership. Alfred Kahn, as early as the mid-1970s, described the &quot;experience, theory and fads&quot; of neighbourhood service delivery over the prior decade, including discussion of income transfers and poverty. Neighbourhoods, as a core aspect of community, also are the site of services for youth, including children with disabilities and coordinated approaches to low-income populations. While the term neighbourhood organisation is not as common in 2015, these organisations often are non-profit, sometimes grassroots or even core funded community development centres or branches.

Community and economic development activists have pressured for reinvestment in local communities and neighbourhoods. In the early 2000s, Community Development Corporations, Rehabilitation Networks, Neighbourhood Development Corporations, and Economic Development organisations would work together to address the housing stock and the infrastructures of communities and neighbourhoods (e.g., community centres). Community and Economic Development may be understood in different ways, and may involve &quot;faith-based&quot; groups and congregations in cities.

==As a unit in urban design==

In the early 1900s, Clarence Perry described the idea of a neighbourhood unit as a self-contained residential area within a city. The concept is still influential in New Urbanism. Practitioners seek to revive traditional sociability in planned suburban housing based on a set of principles. At the same time, the neighbourhood is a site of interventions to create Age-Friendly Cities and Communities (AFCC) as many older adults tend to have narrower life space. Urban design studies thus use neighbourhood as a unit of analysis.

==Neighbourhoods around the world==

===Asia===

====China====
In mainland China, the term is generally used for the urban administrative division found immediately below the district level, although an intermediate, subdistrict level exists in some cities. They are also called streets (administrative terminology may vary from city to city). Neighbourhoods encompass 2,000 to 10,000 families. Within neighbourhoods, families are grouped into smaller residential units or quarters of 100 to 600 families and supervised by a residents&#x27; committee; these are subdivided into residents&#x27; small groups of fifteen to forty families. In most urban areas of China, neighbourhood, community, residential community, residential unit, residential quarter have the same meaning: or or or , and is the direct sublevel of a subdistrict (), which is the direct sublevel of a district (), which is the direct sublevel of a city (). (See Administrative divisions of the People&#x27;s Republic of China)

===Europe===

====United Kingdom====
The term has no general official or statistical purpose in the United Kingdom, but is often used by local boroughs for self-chosen sub-divisions of their area for the delivery of various services and functions, as for example in Kingston-upon-Thames or is used as an informal term to refer to a small area within a town or city. The label is commonly used to refer to organisations which relate to such a very local structure, such as neighbourhood policing or Neighbourhood watch schemes. In addition, government statistics for local areas are often referred to as neighbourhood statistics, although the data themselves are broken down usually into districts and wards for local purposes. In many parts of the UK wards are roughly equivalent to neighbourhoods or a combination of them.

===North America===
In the United States and Canada, neighbourhoods are often given official or semi-official status through neighbourhood associations, neighbourhood watches or block watches. These may regulate such matters as lawn care and fence height, and they may provide such services as block parties, neighbourhood parks and community security. In some other places the equivalent organization is the parish, though a parish may have several neighbourhoods within it depending on the area.

In localities where neighbourhoods do not have an official status, questions can arise as to where one neighbourhood begins and another ends. Many cities use &quot;districts&quot; and &quot;wards&quot; as official divisions of the city, rather than traditional neighbourhood boundaries. ZIP Code boundaries and post office names also sometimes reflect neighbourhood identities.

<text>Limoges ( , , ; , locally ) is a city and commune, and the prefecture of the Haute-Vienne department in west-central France. It was the administrative capital of the former Limousin region. Situated on the first western foothills of the Massif Central, Limoges is crossed by the river Vienne, of which it was originally the first ford crossing point.

The second most populated town in the New Aquitaine region after Bordeaux, a university town, an administrative centre and intermediate services with all the facilities of a regional metropolis, it has an urban area of 323,789 inhabitants in 2018. The inhabitants of the city are called the Limougeauds.

Founded around 10 BC under the name of Augustoritum, it became an important Gallo-Roman city. During the Middle Ages Limoges became a large city, strongly marked by the cultural influence of the Abbey of Saint-Martial, where the Dukes of Aquitaine were invested and crowned. From the 12th century onwards, its enamels were exported throughout the Christian world. In 1765, during the industrial revolution, the discovery of a deposit of kaolin in the Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche region enabled the development of the Limoges porcelain industry. It is sometimes nicknamed &quot;the red city&quot; or &quot;the Rome of socialism&quot; because of its tradition of voting on the left and the workers&#x27; events it experienced from the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century.

Since the 1990s, the city has had a basketball club, Limoges CSP, which has won several French championships and the European championship in 1993. Because of its heritage policy, it has held the label &quot;City of Art and History&quot; since 2008. Economic activities include butchering, electrical equipment for the building industry, and luxury goods. It is home to porcelain houses and art workshops working with enamel or stained glass. This craft expertise led it to join the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in 2017 in the thematic category &quot;Crafts and Popular Arts&quot;.

== History ==

=== Ancient and medieval history ===
Scarce remains of pre-urban settlements have been found in the area of Limoges. The capital of the Gaulish people of the Lemovices, who lived in the area, was probably either near Villejoubert, some kilometres south-east of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, or St Gence, just west of Limoges.

The city proper was founded as Augustoritum by the Romans, around 10 BC: &quot;rito-&quot; is Gaulish for &quot;ford&quot;. The foundation was part of the reorganization of the province by the emperor Augustus, hence the new name. The Roman city included an amphitheatre measuring 136 x 115 metres, a theatre, a forum, baths and several sanctuaries. According to tradition, a temple consecrated to Venus, Diana, Minerva and Jupiter was located near the modern cathedral. The city was on the typical Roman square plan, with two main streets crossing in the centre. It had a Senate and a currency of its own, a sign of its importance in the imperial age. Later, like many towns and cities in Gaul, it was renamed after the tribe (here the Lemovices) whose chief town it was; &quot;Lemovices&quot; subsequently evolved into &quot;Limoges&quot;, and &quot;Lemovicinus&quot; for the area around changed into &quot;Limousin&quot;.

Limoges was evangelized by Saint Martial, who came to the city around 250 with two companions, Alpinianus and Austriclinienus. However, in the late 3rd century it was increasingly abandoned, due to unsafe conditions created by the invasions of various Germanic tribes. The population was concentrated instead in a more easily fortifiable site, the modern Puy Saint-Étienne, which is the centre of the modern Limoges. Starting from the construction of the Abbey of St. Martial (9th century), another settlement grew around the tomb of the saint, while a third area, next to the residence of the viscount (the future Castle of Saint Martial), seems to have been populated from the 10th century.

Starting from the 11th century, thanks to the presence of the Abbey of St. Martial and its large library, Limoges became a flourishing artistic centre. It was home to an important school of medieval music composition, which is usually called the St. Martial School; its most famous member was the 13th-century troubadour Bertran de Born.

In the 13th century, at the peak of its splendour, central Limoges consisted of two fortified settlements.
* The town proper, with a new line of walls encompassing the Vienne River, inhabited mainly by clerks and workers. It has a bridge on the Vienne river named after Saint-Étienne, built by the bishops, and a developed port. Sacked in 1370, it never recovered entirely.
* The castle, with 12 meter-high walls, including the abbey and controlled by the abbot, sometimes in contrast with the bishop-ruled town (&quot;la Cité&quot;). Traces of the walls can still be seen in the city centre. Outside the lines of walls were the popular quarters.

In 1370, Limoges was occupied by Edward, the Black Prince, who massacred some 300 residents, &quot;perhaps a sixth of the normal population&quot;, with another 60 members of the garrison of 140 dead as well.

=== Modern history ===
The porcelain industry started to develop, favoured by the presence of kaolinite which was discovered near Limoges in 1768 (near St Yrieix, south-west of Limoges). Many of the inhabitants became employed in the new sector or in connected activities (including the lumbering of wood needed for firing the porcelain) in manufacture and exporting needed for European distribution of Limoges Boxes, dinnerware, and other porcelain wares. Because the Limousin region has had a long history of breeding (Baronet sheep and Limousine cows), the leather industry also settled in and around Limoges along the banks of the Vienne–the river providing the necessary water and power. Factories in Limoges and St Junien still produce luxury leather shoes, gloves, and bags.

The city and castle were united in 1792 to form the single city of Limoges. During the French Revolution several religious edifices, considered symbols of the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, were destroyed by the population: these included the Abbey of St. Martial itself.

In the 19th century Limoges saw strong construction activity, which included the destruction and rebuilding of much of the city centre. The unsafe conditions of the poorer population is highlighted by the outbreak of several riots, including that of July–November 1830 and April 1848. The first French confederation of workers, Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT) (General Confederation of Labour), was created in Limoges in 1895.

In early 1905, strikes began in another local industry, shoe factories soon followed in the porcelain factories. Barricades were built, the army intervened. There would be two casualties: a horse and a young porcelain worker, Camille Vardelle.

During World War II, many Jews from Alsace were evacuated to and around Limoges.

== Climate ==
Limoges experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;) common to much of Western France. Most precipitation occurs between October and February. On 27 December 1999, winds reached . On average, the city experiences 41 days of frost and 18 days of snow each winter. In June, July and August, precipitation tends to come only from violent thunderstorms coming from the Bay of Biscay.

== Demographics ==
In 2018, the population of the commune proper was 131,479, and of the Limoges functional urban area 323,789. Inhabitants of Limoges are called &quot;limougeauds&quot; in French. The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Limoges proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Limoges absorbed the former commune of Beaune-les-Mines in 1962.

== Main sights ==


* The Crypt of Saint Martial, 10th century, including the tomb of the bishop who evangelized the city. It was discovered in the 1960s while building an underground parking lot (place de la république).
* Remains of the Gallo-Roman amphitheatre, one of the largest in ancient Gaul. 
* The Gothic Limoges Cathedral (Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Limoges), begun in 1273 and only finished in 1888. It is noted for a fine loft built in 1534 and for the partly octagonal bell tower. The main artistic works are a Renaissance rood screen and the tomb of the bishop Jean de Langeac, with sculpted scenes of the Apocalypse.
* The &quot;Chapelle Saint-Aurélien&quot; (14th–17th centuries). It includes the relics of St. Aurelian, the second bishop of Limoges, and has medieval statues and Baroque works of art.
* The church of &quot;St-Pierre-du-Queyroix&quot;, begun in the 12th century
* Church of &quot;St-Michel-des-Lions&quot;, begun in 1364. It houses the relics of St. Martial and has stained-glass windows from the 15th–16th century. The most striking feature is the 65 m-high tower, with a spire surmounted by a big bronze ball.
* The bridges of Saint Martial (dating from the Roman era) and of St-Étienne (13th century).
* The Limoges Fine Arts Museum (Musée des Beaux-Arts), housed in the 18th-century bishops&#x27; palace (&#x27;Palais de l&#x27;Évêché&#x27;).

* The city&#x27;s botanical gardens include the Jardin botanique de l&#x27;Evêché next to the cathedral.
* The University of Limoges was founded in 1968.

==Art and literature==
&quot;Le marché de Limoges&quot; (Limoges market) is the name of a section of Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky.

In 1768, kaolin, a rock rich in fine, white clay which is used for making porcelain, was discovered at Saint-Yrieix-la-Perche, 30 km south of Limoges. Under the impetus of the progressive economist Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune, who had been appointed &quot;intendant&quot; of this impoverished and isolated region, a new ceramics industry was developed, and Limoges porcelain became famous during the 19th century. However, Limoges porcelain is a generic term for porcelain produced in Limoges rather than at a specific factory (there are still several porcelain factories in and around Limoges). More than 50% of all porcelain made in France comes from Limoges.

== Education ==
Limoges hosts the national ceramics school École d&#x27;ingénieurs ENSIL-ENSCI, created in 1893, and also the University of Limoges.

== Sports ==
The city is one of France&#x27;s basketball capitals. The Palais des Sports de Beaublanc, has been host for international basketball events such as the EuroBasket 1983 and serves as home court for the professional team CSP Limoges (Cercle St Pierre). Since 1983, the club has been French champion 11 times (1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1994, 2000, 2014, 2015) and 5 European titles (1982, 1983, 2000 (Korac Cup), 1988 (FIBA Saporta Cup), 1993 (Euroleague)). It was the first French club team to become European champion in a collective sport.

== Transport ==
The main railway station of Limoges is the Limoges-Bénédictins station. It offers direct connections with Paris, and Toulouse, and several regional destinations. Limoges was the last major urban centre of Metropolitan France to be connected to the national motorway system; since the early 1990s, the motorway A20 connects Limoges with Châteauroux, Vierzon, Orléans and Paris to the north, and Brive-la-Gaillarde, Cahors, Montauban and Toulouse to the south. The nearest airport is Limoges – Bellegarde Airport.

Urban transport in Limoges and its metropolitan area is operated by Société de transports en commun de Limoges Métropole (STCL). The Limoges urban bus network includes the Limoges trolleybus system, one of only four such systems currently operating in France.

<text>Charles Percier (; 22 August 1764 – 5 September 1838) was a neoclassical French architect, interior decorator and designer, who worked in a close partnership with Pierre François Léonard Fontaine, originally his friend from student days. For work undertaken from 1794 onward, trying to ascribe conceptions or details to one or other of them is fruitless; it is impossible to disentangle their cooperative efforts in this fashion. Together, Percier and Fontaine were inventors and major proponents of the rich, grand, consciously-archaeological versions of neoclassicism we recognise as Directoire style and Empire style.

==Biography==

Percier was born into a poor Parisian family in 1764. His mother was a laundry woman for Marie-Antoinette and his father was a porter at one of the gates of the Palace of Tuileries, who was later promoted into a post in the interior of the palace. This afforded the young Charles Portier an opportunity to observe first hand the lifestyles of the wealthy nobility in a palace that he would, years later, play a major role in rejuvenating.

=== Schooling and early career ===
From the age of 12 onward, Percier attended a free school for teaching drawing, an establishment whose mission was to provide access into the art world for poor students. Percier&#x27;s talent was quickly recognised. After passing a short time in the studio of a painter named Lagrenée, a place was found for him in the highly respected studio of the renowned architect, Antoine-François Peyre. It was there that he met Pierre Fontaine, with whom he would form a life-long and very successful partnership. Starting in 1794, Fontaine and Percier worked so closely together that it is often difficult to separate their contributions. A 19th century observer noted the following about their intertwined careers: &quot;It is surprising what a complete mastery these young men in a few years contrived to exercise over the tastes of their day.&quot; 

Percier won the second prix de Rome in 1783, and, in 1784, at the age of twenty years, he won the grand prix de Rome (with a pension). This paid for his stay in Rome. Fontaine had won the second prix de Rome a year earlier and was already in Rome. Percier returned to Paris from Rome in 1791.

One early product of their collaboration was &quot;Palais, maisons et autres édifices modernes dessinés à Rome&quot; (&quot;A palace, houses and other modern buildings designed in Rome&quot;), which attracted the attention of prospective clients when they returned to Paris. At the end of 1792, near the end of the first phase of the French Revolution, Percier was appointed to supervise the scenery at the Paris Opéra, a post at the center of innovative design. Fontaine returned from the security of London and they continued at the Opéra together until 1796. was a third member of their team. 

=== Architect, designer and artist ===
Their initial successes in interior decoration came while serving wealthy, private clients: &quot;The first clients of Percier and Fontaine were the financiers Ouvrard, Chauvelin and Gaudin, who had their recently acquired hotels in the Chaussée d&#x27;Antin district fitted out and decorated.&quot; It was through these private projects, which impressed the influential artist, David, that they first came to the attention of Joséphine de Beauharnais and Napoleon Bonaparte.

Bonaparte thought highly of their work and gave them responsibility for some of the most prestigious projects of the Consulate and the Empire periods, including the creation of the Rue de Rivoli and the development of the Louvre Palace. He appointed them as his personal architects and never wavered in his decision; they worked on imperial projects throughout Napoleon&#x27;s time in power. The relationship only dissolved when Napoleon abdicated and was exiled to Elba in 1814. From that time forward, Percier conducted a student &quot;atelier&quot;, a teaching studio or workshop, and Fontaine became the more public face of the partnership. 

They worked for ten years (1802–1812) on the Louvre. The old Louvre palace had not been a royal residence for generations, so it was free of any taint associated with the detested Bourbons. It stood in the heart of Paris, so that the Emperor could be seen coming and going, unlike Versailles, which had been rendered uninhabitable through destruction and looting. They also pierced the first, western part of the rue de Rivoli, and built its distinctive arcades, and, in the process, built the northern, &#x27;Rivoli&#x27; wing of the Louvre, thereby competing the Cour Carrée.:199
They refurbished and restructured the Tuileries Palace that, prior to be burnt down during the Paris Commune, faced the Louvre across the Place du Carrousel and the parterres. In that prominent square, Percier and Fontaine designed the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1807–1808), commemorating the Napoleonic victories of the Third and Fourth Coalitions. Far from adhering to the classical model of nude statues, the designers of the Arc innovated by positioning, at the top of each of the Arc&#x27;s eight marble columns, statues representing the eight corps of the Napoleonic army. Their uniforms are faithfully depicted in detail in these statues.:115

Percier and Fontaine also refurbished Josephine&#x27;s Château de Malmaison, as well as the Château de Montgobert for Pauline Bonaparte, and made alterations and decorations for former Bourbon palaces or castles at Compiègne, Saint-Cloud, and Fontainebleau. In working on these projects, they designed every detail of the interior decors: state beds, sculptural side tables, and other furniture, wall lights and candlesticks, chandeliers, door hardware, textiles, and wallpaper. 

On special occasions, Percier was called upon to design for the Sèvres porcelain manufactory: in 1814 Percier&#x27;s published designs were adapted by Alexandre Brogniart, director of Sèvres, a grand classicising vase 137 cm tall, that came to be known as the &quot;Londonderry Vase&quot; when Louis XVIII gave it to the Marquess of Londonderry just before the Congress of Vienna. Percier also designed the religious objects used in the baptism of Napoleon’s son.:220

In 1812, Percier and Fontaine published the &quot;Recueil de décoration intérieure concernant tout ce qui rapporte à l&#x27;ameublement&quot; (&quot;Collection of interior designs: Everything that relates to furniture&quot;) with its engravings in a spare outline technique. These engravings spread their style beyond the Empire, helping to put a French stamp on the English Regency style and influencing the Dutch-British connoisseur-designer, Thomas Hope. Indeed, their Empire style proved to be influential throughout Europe.

=== The partnership with Fontaine ===

Percier and Fontaine lived together for years as well as being colleagues and partners. Their different personalities and interests meant that they played different roles within the partnership. Fontaine assumed the public role and was the active manager of their projects and relations with clients, while Percier led a more reclusive existence in his apartments in the Louvre, while still participating conceptually in their joint projects and teaching at Beaux Arts.:33 Unlike Pierre Fontaine, whose diary relates his career path from the Consulate until the end of the July Monarchy, Percier did not leave memoirs, but, instead, he bequeathed his collections of drawings to the Institut de France.

=== Death ===
Percier died on 5 September 1838. Fontaine designed a tomb for him in their characteristic style in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery. Fontaine died much later on 10 October 1853. His body was interred in the tomb he designed for Percier, in accordance with his wishes.

<doc id="177201" wikidata="Q2704227" url="?curid=177201" title="Accidental Death of an Anarchist">
<text>Accidental Death of an Anarchist () is a play by Italian playwright Dario Fo that premiered in 1970. It has been performed across the world in more than forty countries. The play is based on the 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing and on the death of Giuseppe Pinelli while being interrogated by the police.

==Plot==

The play opens with Inspector Francesco Bertozzo interrogating a clever, quick-witted and mischievous fraudster, simply known as the Maniac, in Bertozzo&#x27;s office on the third floor of the police headquarters in Milan. The Maniac constantly outsmarts the dim-witted Bertozzo and, when Bertozzo leaves the room, intercepts a phone call from Inspector Pissani. Pissani reveals to the Maniac that a judge is due at the police station to investigate the interrogation of an &quot;accidental&quot; death of the anarchist, whilst the Maniac pretends to be a colleague of Bertozzo&#x27;s and tells Pissani that Bertozzo is &quot;blowing a raspberry&quot; at him. The Maniac decides to impersonate the judge, Marco Malipiero, an opportunity he has been waiting a while for, and to humiliate the policemen responsible for the &quot;accidental&quot; death of an Anarchist. After Bertozzo re-enters his office, the Maniac is forced out of the office, taking Bertozzo&#x27;s coat and hat to use in his disguise. Bertozzo chases him, running into Pissani, who punches him in retaliation for &quot;blowing a raspberry&quot; at him.

The Maniac, now impersonating Malipiero, finds Pissani and his lackey, the Constable, in the room where the anarchist was during his interrogation. Telling them that he is Malipiero, the Maniac asks for the Superintendent, who was involved with the interrogation with Pissani and the Constable. The Maniac orders the three policemen to re-enact the events of the interrogation; in turn fabricating many of the events, such as changing beating the anarchist to making jokes with him, incorporating new lines into the transcript and even breaking out in song. When the investigation reaches the matter of the fall, the Constable reveals he grabbed the anarchist&#x27;s shoe, in an attempt to stop him from falling. However, the Maniac notes that witnesses reported that the anarchist had both shoes on. When Pissani surmises that the anarchist was wearing a galosh, the Superintendent breaks into a rage, making Pissani accidentally reveal that the Superintendent pushed the anarchist out of the window. The two policemen then realise that the Maniac was listening. The phone in the office suddenly rings, which Pissani answers. He tells them that it is a journalist called Maria Feletti, whom the Superintendent agreed to meet to clear rumors about the interrogation, wanting to come up to the office.

As the presence of Judge Malipiero would endanger them, the policemen tell the Maniac to leave for the time being. Instead, the Maniac intends to disguise himself as a forensic expert from Rome, Captain Piccini. The Maniac leaves the office. Feletti nearly exposes the three policemen, until the Maniac re-enters, as an extravagantly-dressed amputee. The Maniac manages to concoct a story on how the anarchist died: one of the impatient policemen hit the anarchist in the neck, an ambulance being called; the anarchist then being led to the window for fresh air, and pushed accidentally out of the window due to uncoordinated balance between the two policemen leading him to the window. Feletti is unconvinced, noting how the death of the anarchist was reported by the police to be a suicide, opposed to their original comment that it was &quot;accidental&quot;. Bertozzo suddenly enters, delivering a replica of a bomb from another attack. Bertozzo partially recognises the Maniac, as he knows Captain Piccini, but is dissuaded by Pissani and the Superintendent. Feletti begins to pick out the inconsistencies in the policemen&#x27;s stories, and showing that bombers in Milan are fascists, not revolutionaries.

Bertozzo realises that &quot;Piccini&quot; is the Maniac, after seeing his coat and hat on a stand. Bertozzo, holding the policemen at gunpoint, orders Feletti to cuff the three policemen; getting the Maniac to show them his medical records, exposing him as a fraud. The Maniac reveals a tape recorder, which he used to record Pissani and the Superintendent&#x27;s tirade, exposing their crime. The Maniac strips off his disguise, making him recognizable to Feletti, who identifies him as Paulo Davidovitch Gandolpho, the &quot;Prose Pimpernel of the Permanent Revolution&quot; and &quot;notorious sports editor of Lotta Continua&quot;. Revealing that the bomb replica can in fact work, setting it off on a timer, the Maniac has Bertozzo join his fellow policemen. Feletti attempts to stop the Maniac, citing the Maniac as an &quot;extremist&quot; and &quot;fanatic&quot;. The Maniac, instead of killing her, offers her an ultimatum: save the four corrupt policemen, acquitting them and the Maniac will be put behind bars; or leave them to die for their crime and unwittingly join the extremist movement as an accomplice. The Maniac then leaves to spread the recording.

The Maniac then addresses the audience, showing what the scenario entails. When Feletti leaves them, the four policemen die in the resulting explosion. However, the Maniac then offers the second result: sticking to the rule of law, Feletti releases them, but is chained to the window by the policemen when they realize that Feletti knows what they did. The Maniac then leaves the audience to decide which ending they prefer.

== Adaptations and legacy ==

A Hindi adaptation of the play, &quot;Bechara Mara Gaya&quot;, was made into a film. Another earlier adaptation, &quot;Dhool Me Lipta Sach&quot;, ran in Pune. A Chinese adaptation with some changes to the original script was directed by Meng Jinghui.

Ed Emery was the translator for an authorised English-language version of the play. In 1979, Gavin Richards of the socialist political theatre group Belt and Braces developed an adaptation that was staged at London&#x27;s Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre with both Richards and Alfred Molina alternating in the lead role of &quot;The Maniac&quot;, for which Richards was nominated for an Olivier Award. A TV movie of the play, with the Belt and Braces cast and Richards once more in the lead, was commissioned by Channel 4 in 1983 and broadcast the subsequent year.

A sequel, &quot;Pum pum! Chi è? La polizia!&quot; (&quot;Knock Knock! Who&#x27;s There? The Police!&quot;), was written in 1974. Semiotician Umberto Eco commented favourably on the sequel in his column in the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;.

An English adaptation by Tom Basden starring Daniel Rigby premiered at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield in October 2022 before transferring to the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in May 2023 and then the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London&#x27;s West End in June 2023.

An English adaptation by Wild Rice, Singapore under the leadership of Ivan Heng, co-directed by Jo Kukathas and Glen Goei starring Ghafir Akbar was premiered on 28th September 2024 in Singapore, two preview shows scheduled for 26th and 27th September 2024 were cancelled as the script had not received the requisite approvals.

<text>The Kikuyu (also &quot;Agĩkũyũ/Gĩkũyũ&quot;) are a Bantu ethnic group native to East Africa Central Kenya. At a population of 8,148,668 as of 2019, they account for 17.13% of the total population of Kenya, making them Kenya&#x27;s largest ethnic group.
The term &quot;Kikuyu&quot; is the Swahili borrowing of the autonym ()

==History==


===Origin===
The Kikuyu belong to the Northeastern Bantu branch. Their language is most closely related to that of the Embu and Mbeere. Geographically, they are concentrated in the vicinity of Mount Kenya.

The exact place that the Northeast Bantu speakers migrated from after the initial Bantu expansion is uncertain. Some authorities suggest that the Kikuyu arrived in their present Mount Kenya area of habitation from earlier settlements further to the north and east, while others argue that the Kikuyu, along with their closely related Eastern Bantu neighbours the Embu, Meru, Mbeere, and Kamba moved into Kenya from points further north.

From archaeological evidence, their arrival at the northern side of Mt. Kenya dates to around the 3rd century, as part of the larger group known as Thagicu. By the 6th century, there was a community of Agikuyu newly established at Gatung&#x27;ang&#x27;a in Nyeri. The Agikuyu established themselves in their current homeland of Mt. Kenya region by the 13th century.

===Before 1888===

====The nation and its pursuits====
Before the establishment of East Africa Protectorate in 1895, the Agĩkũyũ preserved geographic and political power from almost all external influence for many generations; they had never been subdued. Before the arrival of the British, Arabs involved in slave trading and their caravans passed at the southern edges of the Agĩkũyũ nation. Slavery as an institution did not exist amongst the Agĩkũyũ, nor did they make raids for the capture of slaves. The Arabs who tried to venture into Agĩkũyũ land met instant death. Relying on a combination of land purchases, blood-brotherhood (partnerships), intermarriage with other people, and their adoption and absorption, the Agĩkũyũ were in a constant state of territorial expansion. Economically, the Agĩkũyũ were great farmers and shrewd businesspeople. Besides farming and business, the Agĩkũyũ were involved in small scale industries with professions such as bridge building, string making, wire drawing, and iron chain making. The Agĩkũyũ had a great sense of justice (&quot;kĩhooto&quot;).

====Social and political life====
The Agĩkũyũ nation was divided into nine clans. These nine clans are the Anjirũ, Agacikũ, Ambũi, Angũi aka Aithiegeni, Angechi aka Aithĩrandũ, Aacera, Ambura aka Aakĩũrũ aka Eethaga, Airimũ aka Agathiigia, Angarĩ aka Aithekahuno and Aicakamũyũ and all clans and families emanate from them perpetually, through patriarchy. Each clan traced its lineage to a single &quot;female ancestor&quot; and a daughter of Mumbi. The clans were not restricted to any particular geographical area, they lived side by side. Some clans had a recognised leader, others did not. However, in either case, real political power was exercised by the ruling council of elders for each clan. Each clan then forwarded the leader of its council to the apex council of elders for the whole community. The overall council of elders representing all the clans was then led by a &quot;headman&quot; or the nation&#x27;s spokesman.

====Spirituality and religion====

=====Ngai – The Supreme Creator=====
The Gĩkũyũ were – and still are – monotheists believing in an omnipotent Creator whom they refer to as Ngai. All of the Gĩkũyũ, Embu, and Kamba use this name. Ngai was also known as Mũrungu by the Meru and Embu tribes, or Mũlungu (a variant of a word referring to the Creator). The title Mwathani or Mwathi (the greatest ruler) comes from the word &quot;gwatha&quot; meaning to rule or reign with authority, was and is still used. All sacrifices to Ngai were performed under a sycamore tree (Mũkũyũ) and if one was not available, a fig tree (Mũgumo) would be used. The olive tree (Mũtamaiyũ) was a sacred tree for women.

=====Mount Kenya and religion=====
&quot;Ngai&quot; or &quot;Mwene-Nyaga&quot; is the Supreme Creator and giver of all things. He created the first Gĩkũyũ communities, and provided them with all the resources necessary for life: land, rain, plants, and animals. Ngai cannot be seen but is manifested in the sun, moon, stars, comets and meteors, thunder and lightning, rain, rainbows, and in the great fig trees (Mugumo). These trees served as places of worship and sacrifice and marked the spot at Mũkũrwe Wa Nyagathanga where Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi – the ancestors of the Gĩkũyũ in the oral legend – first settled. Ngai has human characteristics, and although some say that he lives in the sky or in the clouds, Gĩkũyũ lore also says that Ngai comes to earth from time to time to inspect it, bestow blessings, and mete out punishment. When he comes, Ngai rests on Mount Kenya (Kīrīnyaga) and Kilimambogo (kĩrĩma kĩa njahĩ). Thunder is interpreted to be the movement of Ngai and lightning is the weapon used by Ngai to clear the way when moving from one sacred place to another. Some people believe that Ngai&#x27;s abode is on Mount Kenya. In one legend Ngai made the mountain his resting place while on an inspection tour of earth. Ngai then took the first man, Gikuyu, to the top to point out the beauty of the land he was giving him.

=====Philosophy of the Traditional Kikuyu Religion=====
The cardinal points in this Traditional Gĩkũyũ Religion Philosophy were squarely based on the general Bantu peoples thought as follows:
#The universe is composed of interacting and interconnected forces whose manifestation is the physical things we see, including ourselves and those we do not see.
#All those forces (things) in the universe came from God who, from the beginning of time, have had the vital divine force of creation within himself.
#Everything created by God retains a bond from God (Creator) to the created.
#The first humans who were created by God have the strongest vital force because they got it directly from God.
#Because these first humans sit just below God in power, they are almost like Gods or even can be Gods.
#The current parent of an individual is the link to God through the immediate dead and through ancestors.
#On Earth, humans have the highest quantity of vital force.
#All the other things (forces) on Earth were created to enable human vital force (being) become stronger.
#All things have vital force but some objects, plants and animals have higher vital force than others.
#A human can use an animal to symbolize the level of his vital force compared to other humans.
#There is a specific point within every physical manifestation (thing) of vital force where most of that force is concentrated.
#A human can easily manipulate things to his advantage or to their detriment by identifying this point of concentration of vital force. There are human beings who have more knowledge of these forces and can manipulate them at will usually by invoking higher forces to assist.
#Higher forces are invoked by humans using lower forces (animal or plant sacrifice) as intermediaries. To approach higher forces directly is &quot;thahu&quot; (abomination which leads to a curse).
#The human society has some few elite people very skilled in the art of manipulating forces to strengthen a human(s) force or diminish it, strengthen any force below human force or diminish it.
#The leader of a human society is the one possessing the highest vital force as at that time or the one closest to God or both. Since the leader of this human society has the highest vital force and hence closer to God than any other person, he should be able to nourish the rest of the people by linking them to the ultimate God and by being able to command lower forces to act in such a way so as to reinforce the other humans&#x27; vital force.
#The life force of a dead ancestor can come back to life through the act of birth of a new child, especially when the child is named after the departed ancestor and all is seen to be well.

The Gĩkũyũ held a belief in the interconnection of everything in the universe. To the Gĩkũyũ people, everything we see has an inner spiritual force and the most sacred though unspoken ontology was being is force. This spiritual vital force originated from God, who had the power to create or destroy that life force. To the Gĩkũyũ people, God was the supreme being in the universe and the giver (Mũgai/Ngai) of this life force to everything that exists. Gĩkũyũ people also believed that everything God created had a vital inner force and a connection bond to Him by the mere fact that he created that thing and gave it that inner force that makes it be and be manifested physically. To the Agĩkũyũ, God had this life force within himself hence He was the ultimate owner and ruler of everything in the universe. The latter was the ultimate conception of God among the Gĩkũyũ people hence the name Mũgai/Ngai. To the Gĩkũyũ people, those who possessed the greatest life force, those closest to God were the first parents created by God because God directly gave them the vital living force. These first parents were so respected to be treated almost like God himself. These were followed by the ancestors of the people who inherited life force from the first parents, then followed by the immediate dead and finally the eldest in the community. Hence when people wanted to offer sacrifices, the eldest in the community would perform the rites. Children in the community had a link to God through their parents and that chain would move upwards to parent parents, ancestors, first created parents until it reaches God Himself. The Gĩkũyũ people believed the departed spirits of the ancestors can be reborn again in this world when children are being born, hence the rites performed during the child naming ceremonies. The Gĩkũyũ people believed the vital life force or soul of a person can be increased or diminished, thereby affecting the person&#x27;s health. They also believed that some people possessed power to manipulate the inner force in all things. These people who increased the well-being of a person spirit were called medicine-men (Mũgo) while those who diminished the person&#x27;s life force were called witchdoctors (Mũrogi). They also believed that ordinary items can have their spiritual powers increased such that they protect a person against those bent on diminishing a person vital life force. Such an item with such powers was called &quot;gĩthitũ&quot;. Thus, the philosophy of the Gĩkũyũ religion and life, in general, was anchored on the understanding that everything in the universe has an inner interlinked force that we do not see. God among the Gĩkũyũ people was understood hence to be the owner and distributor (Mũgai) of this inner life force in all things and He was worshiped and praised to either increase the life force of all things (farm produce, cattle, children) the Gĩkũyũ people possessed and minimize events that led to catastrophes that would diminish the life force of the people or lead to death. The leader of the Gĩkũyũ people was the person who was thought to possess the greatest life force among the people or the person who had demonstrated the greatest life force in taking care of the people, their families, their farm produce, their cattle and their land. This person was hence thought to be closer to God than anybody else living in that nation. The said person also had to demonstrate and practice the highest levels of truth (&quot;maa&quot;) and justice (&quot;kihooto&quot;), just like the supreme God of the Gĩkũyũ people would do.

====Political structures and generational change====

The Agĩkũyũ had four seasons and two harvests in one year.
# &quot;Mbura ya njahĩ&quot; (the season of big rain) from March to July;
# &quot;Magetha ma njahĩ&quot; (&quot;njahĩ&quot; being Lablab purpureus) (the season of the black bean harvest) between July and early October;
# &quot;Mbura ya Mwere&quot; (short rain season) from October to January;
# &quot;Magetha ma Mwere&quot; (the season of harvesting) &quot;milletà&quot;;
# &quot;Mbura ya Kĩmera&quot;.

Further, time was recorded through the initiation by circumcision. Each initiation group was given a special name. According to Professor Godfrey Mũriũki, the individual initiation sets are then grouped into a regiment every nine calendar years. Before a regiment or army was set, there was a period in which no initiation of boys took place. This period lasted a total of four and a half calendar years (nine seasons in Gĩkũyũ land, each season referred to as &quot;imera&quot;) and is referred to as &quot;mũhingo&quot;, with initiation taking place at the start of the fifth year and going on annually for the next nine calendar years. This was the system adopted in Metumi Murang&#x27;a. The regiment or army sets also get special names, some of which seem to have ended up as popular male names. In Gaki Nyeri the system was inversed with initiation taking place annually for four calendar years, which would be followed by a period of nine calendar years in which no initiation of boys took place (&quot;mũhingo&quot;). Girls, on the other hand, were initiated every year. Several regiments then make up a ruling generation. It was estimated that ruling generations lasted an average of 35 years. The names of the initiation and regiment sets vary within Gĩkũyũ land. The ruling generations are however uniform and provide very important chronological data. On top of that, the initiation sets were a way of documenting events within the Gĩkũyũ nation, so, for example, were the occurrence of smallpox and syphilis recorded. Girls&#x27; initiation sets were also accorded special names, although there has been little research in this area. Mũriũki only unearths three sets, whose names are, &quot;Rũharo&quot; [1894], &quot;Kibiri/Ndũrĩrĩ&quot; [1895], &quot;Kagica&quot; [1896], &quot;Ndutu/Nuthi&quot; [1897]. All these names are taken from Metumi (Mũrang&#x27;a) and Kabete Kĩambu.

* &quot;Manjiri&quot; 1512 – 1546 ± 55
* &quot;Mamba&quot; 1547 – 1581 ± 50
* &quot;Tene&quot; 1582 – 1616 ± 45
* &quot;Aagu&quot; 1617 – 1651 ± 40
* &quot;Manduti&quot; 1652 – 1686 ± 35
* &quot;Cuma&quot; 1687 – 1721 ± 30
* &quot;Ciira&quot; 1722 – 1756 ± 25
* &quot;Mathathi&quot; 1757 – 1791 ± 20
* &quot;Ndemi&quot; 1792 – 1826 ± 15
* &quot;Iregi&quot; 1827 – 1861 ± 10
* &quot;Maina&quot; 1862 – 1897 ± 5
* &quot;Mwangi&quot; 1898?

Mathew Njoroge Kabetũ&#x27;s list reads, &quot;Tene&quot;, &quot;Kĩyĩ&quot;, &quot;Aagu&quot;, &quot;Ciĩra&quot;, &quot;Mathathi&quot;, &quot;Ndemi&quot;, &quot;Iregi&quot;, &quot;Maina&quot; (&quot;Ngotho&quot;), &quot;Mwangi&quot;. Gakaara wa Wanjaũ&#x27;s list reads &quot;Tene&quot;, &quot;Nema Thĩ&quot;, &quot;Kariraũ&quot;, &quot;Aagu&quot;, &quot;Tiru&quot;, &quot;Cuma&quot;, &quot;Ciira&quot;, &quot;Ndemi&quot;, &quot;Mathathi&quot;, &quot;Iregi&quot;, &quot;Maina&quot;, &quot;Mwangi&quot;, &quot;Irũngũ&quot;, &quot;Mwangi wa Mandũti&quot;. The last two generations came after 1900. One of the earliest recorded lists by McGregor reads (list taken from a history of unchanged) &quot;Manjiri&quot;, &quot;Mandũti&quot;, &quot;Chiera&quot;, &quot;Masai&quot;, &quot;Mathathi&quot;, &quot;Ndemi&quot;, &quot;Iregi&quot;, &quot;Maina&quot;, &quot;Mwangi&quot;, &quot;Mũirũngũ&quot;. According to Hobley (a historian) each initiation generation, &quot;riika&quot;, extended over two years. The ruling generation at the arrival of the Europeans was called &quot;Maina&quot;. It is said that &quot;Maina&quot; handed over to &quot;Mwangi&quot; in 1898. Hobley asserts that the following sets were grouped under &quot;Maina&quot; – &quot;Kĩnũthia&quot;, &quot;Karanja&quot;, &quot;Njũgũna&quot;, &quot;Kĩnyanjui&quot;, &quot;Gathuru&quot; and &quot;Ng&#x27;ang&#x27;a&quot;. Professor Mũriũki however puts these sets much earlier, namely &quot;Karanja&quot; and &quot;Kĩnũthia&quot; belong to the &quot;Ciira&quot; ruling generation which ruled from the year 1722 to 1756, give or take 25 years, according to &quot;Mũriũki&quot;. &quot;Njũgũna&quot;, &quot;Kĩnyanjui&quot;, &quot;Ng&#x27;ang&#x27;a&quot; belong to the &quot;Mathathi&quot; ruling generation that ruled from 1757 to 1791, give or take 20 years, according to Mũriũki.

Professor Mũriũki&#x27;s list must be given precedence in this area as he conducted extensive research in this area starting 1969, and had the benefit of all earlier literature on the subject as well as doing extensive field work in the areas of Gaki (Nyeri), Metumi (Mũrang&#x27;a) and Kabete (Kĩambu). On top of the ruling generations, he also gives names of the regiments or army sets from 1659 [within a margin of error] and the names of annual initiation sets beginning 1864. The list from Metumi (Mũrang&#x27;a) is most complete and differentiated.

Mũriũki&#x27;s is also the most systematically defined list so far. Most of the most popular male names in Gĩkũyũ land were names of &quot;riikas&quot; (initiation sets). Here is Mũriũki&#x27;s list of the names of regiment sets in Metumi (Mũrang&#x27;a): &quot;Kiariĩ&quot; (1665–1673), &quot;Cege&quot; (1678–1678), &quot;Kamau&quot; (1704–1712), &quot;Kĩmani&quot; (1717–1725), &quot;Karanja&quot; (1730–1738), &quot;Kĩnũthia&quot; (1743–1751), &quot;Njũgũna&quot; (1756–1764), &quot;Kĩnyanjui&quot; (1769–1777), &quot;Ng&#x27;ang&#x27;a&quot; (1781–1789), &quot;Njoroge&quot; (1794–1802), &quot;Wainaina&quot; (1807–1815), &quot;Kang&#x27;ethe&quot; (1820–1828), &quot;Mbũgua&quot; (1859–1867), &quot;Njenga&quot; or &quot;Mbĩra Itimũ&quot; (1872–1880), &quot;Mũtũng&#x27;ũ&quot; or &quot;Mbũrũ&quot; (1885–1893).

H.E. Lambert, who dealt with the &quot;riikas&quot; extensively, has the following list of regiment sets from Gichũgũ and Ndia. (It should be remembered that this names were unlike ruling generations not uniform in Gĩkũyũ land. It should also be noted that Ndia and Gachũgũ followed a system where initiation took place every annually for four years and then a period of nine calendar years followed where no initiation of boys took place. This period was referred to as &quot;mũhingo&quot;.) &quot;Karanja&quot; (1759–1762), &quot;Kĩnũthia&quot; (1772–1775), &quot;Ndũrĩrĩ&quot; (1785–1788), &quot;Mũgacho&quot; (1798–1801), &quot;Njoroge&quot; (1811–1814), &quot;Kang&#x27;ethe&quot; (1824–1827), &quot;Gitaũ&quot; (1837–1840), &quot;Manyaki&quot; (1850–1853), &quot;Kiambũthi&quot; (1863–1866), &quot;Watuke&quot; (1876–1879), &quot;Ngũgĩ&quot; (1889–1892), &quot;Wakanene&quot; (1902–1905).

The remarkable thing in this list in comparison to the Metumi one is how some of the same names are used, if a bit offset. Ndia and Gachũgũ are extremely far from Metumi. Gaki on the other hand, as far as my geographical understanding of Gĩkũyũ land is concerned should be much closer to Metumi, yet virtually no names of regiment sets are shared. It should however be noted that Gaki had a strong connection to the Maasai living nearby.

The ruling generation names of Maina and Mwangi are also very popular male Gĩkũyũ names. The theory is also that &quot;Waciira&quot; is also derived from &quot;ciira&quot; (case), which is also a very popular masculine name among the Agĩkũyũ. This would call into question, when it was exactly that children started being named after the parents of one&#x27;s parents. Had that system, of naming one&#x27;s children after one&#x27;s parents been there from the beginning, there would be very few male names in circulation. This is however not the case, as there are very many Gĩkũyũ male names. One theory is that the female names are much less, with the names of the full-nine daughters of Mũmbi being most prevalent.

Gakaara wa Wanjaũ supports this view when he writes in his book, &quot;Mĩhĩrĩga ya Aagĩkũyũ&quot;,

&quot;Hingo ĩyo ciana cia arũme ciatuagwo marĩĩtwa ma mariika ta Watene, Cuma, Iregi kana Ciira. Nao airĩĩtu magatuuo marĩĩtwa ma mĩhĩrĩga tauria hagwetetwo nah au kabere, o nginya hingo iria maundu maatabariirwo thuuthaini ati ciana ituagwo aciari a mwanake na a muirĩĩtu.&quot;

Freely translated it means &quot;In those days the male children were given the names of the riika (initiation set) like Watene, Cuma, Iregi, or Ciira. Girls were on the other hand named after the clans that were named earlier until such a time as it was decided to name the children after the parents of the man and the woman.&quot; From this statement it is not clear whether the girls were named ad hoc after any clan, no matter what clan the parents belonged to. Naming them after the specific clan that the parents belonged to would have severely restricted naming options.

This would strangely mean that the female names are the oldest in Gĩkũyũ land, further confirming its matrilineal descent. As far as male names are concerned, there is of course the chicken and the egg question, of when a name specifically appeared but some names are tied to events that happened during the initiation. For example, Wainaina refers to those who shivered during circumcision. Kũinaina (to shake or to shiver).

There was a very important ceremony known as Ituĩka in which the old guard would hand over the reins of government to the next generation. This was to avoid dictatorship. Kenyatta related how once, in the land of the Agĩkũyũ, there ruled a despotic King called Gĩkũyũ, grandson of the elder daughter (Wanjirũ according to Leakey) of the original Gĩkũyũ of Gĩkũyũ and Mũmbi fame. After he was deposed, it was decided that the government should be democratic, which is how the Ituĩka came to be. This legend of course calls into question exactly when it was that the matrilineal rule set in. The last Ituĩka ceremony, where the riika of Maina handed over power to the Mwangi generation, took place in 1898–9. The next one was supposed to be held in 1925–1928 [Kenyatta] but was thwarted by the colonial imperialist government and one by one Gĩkũyũ institutions crumbled.

====Collapse of traditional political structure====
The ruling generations, the rĩĩka system can be traced back to the year 1500 AD or thereabouts. These were:
* Manjiri 1512 to 1546
* Mamba 1547 to 1581
* Tene 1582 to 1616
* Agu 1617 to 1652
* Manduti 1652 to 1686
* Cuma 1687 to 1721
* Ciira 1722 to 1756
* Mathathi 1757 to 1791
* Ndemi 1792 to 1826
* Iregi 1827 to 1861
* Maina 1862 to 1897
* Mwangi 1898

The last Ituĩka ceremony where the rĩĩka of Maina handed over power to the Mwangi generation, took place in 1898–1899. The next one was supposed to be held in 1925–1928 but was thwarted by the colonial government. The traditional symbols of power among the Agikuyu nation is the Muthĩgi (Stick) which signifies power to lead and the Itimũ (Spear) signifying power to call people to war.

===1888–1945===

The traditional way of life of Agikuyu was disrupted when they came into contact with the British around 1888. British explorers had visited the region prior the &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;, and now various individuals moved to establish a colony in the region, noting the abundant and fertile farmland. Although initially non-hostile, relationships between the Agikuyu and the Europeans soon turned violent: Waiyaki Wa Hinga, a leader of the southern Agikuyu, who ruled Dagoretti who had signed a treaty with Frederick Lugard of the British East Africa Company (BEAC) burned down Lugard&#x27;s fort in 1890. Waiyaki was captured two years later by the company and buried alive in revenge.

Following severe financial difficulties of the British East Africa Company, the British government on 1 July 1895 established direct Crown rule through the East African Protectorate, subsequently opening in 1902 the fertile highlands to European emigrants. The Agikuyu, upset at the waves of emigrants, enforced a policy of killing any of their own that collaborated with the colonial government. When disputes with white settlers and the Agikuyu became violent (usually over land issues), the settlers would employ Maasai tribesmen together with some colonial troops to carry out their fighting for them. The Maasai had historically negative relations with the Agikuyu, and thus were willing to take up arms against them. The various conflicts between the settlers and the Agikuyu often resulted in defeat for the latter, thanks to their inferior weaponry. The Agikuyu, having been unsuccessful in their conflicts with the European settlers and the colonial government, turned to political means as a method of resolving their grievances.

Kenya served as a base for the British in the First World War as part of their effort to capture the German colonies to the south, which were initially frustrated. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, the governors of British East Africa (as the Protectorate was generally known) and German East Africa agreed to a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. However, Lt. Col Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck took command of the German military forces, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from Germany, von Lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in Zambia eleven days after the Armistice was signed in 1918. To chase von Lettow-Vorbeck, the British deployed Indian Army troops from India and then needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior by foot. The Carrier Corps was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400,000 Africans, contributing to their long-term politicisation.

The experiences gained by Africans in the war, coupled with the creation of the white-dominated Kenya Crown Colony, gave rise to considerable political activity in the 1920s which culminated in Archdeacon Owen&#x27;s &quot;Piny Owacho&quot; (Voice of the People) movement and the &quot;Young Kikuyu Association&quot; (renamed the &quot;East African Association&quot;) started in 1921 by Harry Thuku (1895–1970), which gave a sense of nationalism to many Kikuyu and advocated civil disobedience. Thuku&#x27;s campaign against the colonial government was short-lived. He was exiled to Kismayu the following year, and it was not until 1924 that the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA) was formed to carry on with Thuku&#x27;s campaign. From 1924, the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA), with Jomo Kenyatta as its Secretary General focused on unifying the Kikuyu into one geographic polity, but its project was undermined by controversies over ritual tribute, land allocation, the ban on female circumcision, and support for Thuku. The KCA sent Kenyatta to England in 1924 and again in 1931 to air their grievances against the colonial government and its policies.

By the 1930s, approximately 30,000 white settlers lived in Agikuyu country and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy. The area was already home to over a million members of the Kikuyu nation, most of whom had been pushed off their land by the encroaching European settlers, and lived as itinerant farmers. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the production of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and landless workers were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled.

In the Second World War (1939–45) Kenya became an important military base. For the Agikuyu soldiers who took part in the war as part of the King&#x27;s African Rifles (KAR), the war stimulated African nationalism and shattered their conceptions of Europeans. Meanwhile, on the political front, in 1944 Thuku founded and was first chairman of the multi-ethnic Kenya African Study Union (KASU).

===1945–1963===

In 1946 KASU became the Kenya African Union (KAU). It was a nationalist organisation that demanded access to white-owned land. KAU acted as a constituency association for the first black member of Kenya&#x27;s legislative council, Eliud Mathu, who had been nominated in 1944 by the governor after consulting with the local Bantu/Nilotic elite. The KAU remained dominated by the Kikuyu ethnic group. In 1947 Jomo Kenyatta, the former president of the moderate Kikuyu Central Association, became president of the more aggressive KAU to demand a greater political voice for the native inhabitants. The failure of the KAU to attain any significant reforms or redress of grievances from the colonial authorities shifted the political initiative to younger and more militant figures within the African trade union movement, among the squatters on the settler estates in the Rift Valley and in KAU branches in Nairobi and the Kikuyu districts of central province.

By 1952, under Field Marshal Dedan Kimathi, the Kenya Land and Freedom Army (Mau Mau) launched an all-out revolt against the colonial government, the settlers and their Kenyan allies. By this time, the Mau Mau were fighting for complete independence of Kenya. The war is considered by some the gravest crisis of Britain&#x27;s African colonies The capture of rebel leader Dedan Kimathi on 21 October 1956 signalled the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau Uprising, and essentially ended the military campaign although the state of emergency would last until 1959. The conflict arguably set the stage for Kenyan independence in December 1963.

===1963–present===
Since the proclamation of the Republic of Kenya, after colonial rule in Kenya came to an end in 1963, the Agikuyu now form an integral part of the Kenyan nation. They continue to play their part as citizens of Kenya, helping to build their country. However, some Kenyans resent their incorrectly perceived superior economic status and political power and unity, a resentment sometimes vented through political violence, as happened in 1992, 1997 and 2007 Kenyan elections.

==Genetics==
According to a Y-Chromosome DNA study by Wood &quot;et al.&quot; (2005), around 73% of Gĩkũyũs belong to the common paternal haplogroup E1b1a. The remainder carry other clades: 19% E1b1b with E-M293 contributing 11%, 2% A, and 2% B.

In terms of maternal lineages, Gĩkũyũs closely cluster with other Northeast Bantu speaking groups like the Kamba. Most belong to various Africa-centered mtDNA macro-haplogroup L lineages such as L0f, L3x, L4g and L5 per Castrì &quot;et al.&quot; (2009). Kikuyu were estimated by Tishkoff et al. to have 43% ancestry from the Niger-Kordofan cluster, 36% from Cushitic, 8% from Nilo-Saharan, 6% from Sandawe, and 1% or less from each of the other clusters According to Salas &quot;et al.&quot; (2002), other Gĩkũyũs largely carry the L1a clade, which is one of the African mtDNA Haplogroups.

==Culture==

===Language===
Gĩkũyũs speak the Gĩkũyũ language as their native tongue, which is a member of the Bantu language family. Additionally, many speak Swahili and English as lingua franca, the two official languages of Kenya.

The Gĩkũyũ are closely related to some Bantu communities due to intermarriages prior to colonization. These communities are the Embu, Meru, and Akamba people who also live around Mt. Kenya. Members of the Gĩkũyũ family from the greater Kiambu (commonly referred to as the Kabete) and Nyeri districts are closely related to the Maasai people also due to intermarriage prior to colonization. The Gĩkũyũ people between Thika and Mbeere are closely related to the Kamba people who speak a language similar to Gĩkũyũ. As a result, the Gĩkũyũ people that retain much of the original Gĩkũyũ heritage reside around Kirinyaga and Murang&#x27;a regions of Kenya. The Murang&#x27;a district is considered by many to be the cradle of the Gĩkũyũ people.

===Literature===
Until 1888, the Agikuyu literature was purely expressed in folklore. Famous stories include &quot;The Maiden Who Was Sacrificed By Her Kin&quot;, &quot;The Lost Sister&quot;, &quot;The Four Young Warriors&quot;, &quot;The Girl who Cut the Hair of the N&#x27;jenge&quot;, and many more.

When the European missionaries arrived in the Agikuyu country in 1888, they learned the Kikuyu language and started writing it using a modified Roman alphabet. The Kikuyu responded strongly to missionaries and European education. They had greater access to education and opportunities for involvement in the new money economy and political changes in their country. As a consequence, there are notable Kikuyu literature icons such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o and Meja Mwangi. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o&#x27;s literary works include &quot;Caitani Mutharabaini&quot; (1981), &quot;Matigari&quot; (1986) and &quot;Murogi wa Kagogo&quot; (&quot;Wizard of the Crow&quot; (2006)) which is the largest known Kikuyu language novel having been translated into more than thirty languages.

===Music===
Traditional Kikuyu music has existed for generations up to 1888, when colonialism disrupted their life. Before 1888 and well into the 1920s, Kikuyu music included Kibaata, Nduumo and Muthunguci. Cultural loss increased as urbanization and modernization impacted on indigenous knowledge, including the ability to play the mũtũrĩrũ – an oblique bark flute. Today, music and dance are strong components of Kikuyu culture. There is a vigorous Kikuyu recording industry, for both secular and gospel music, in their pentatonic scale and western music styles such as &quot;Mathwiti Maigi Ngai!&quot;.

===Cinema===
Kikuyu cinema and film production are a very recent phenomenon among the Agikuyu. They have become popular only in the 21st century. In the 20th century, most of the Agikuyu consumed cinema and film produced in the west. Popular Kikuyu film productions include comedies such as Machang&#x27;i series and Kihenjo series. Recently, Kenyan television channels have increased greatly and there are channels that broadcast programs in the Kikuyu language.

===Cuisine===
Typical Agĩkũyũ food includes Yams, sweet potatoes, Gītheri (maize and beans, after corn was introduced to Africa), Mūkimo (mashed green peas and potatoes), Kīmitū (mashed beans and potatoes), Irio (mashed dry beans, corn and potatoes), Mūtura (sausage made using goat intestines, meat and blood), Ūcūrū (fermented porridge made from flour of corn, millet or sorghum) roast goat, beef, chicken and cooked green vegetables such as collards, spinach and carrots.

===Religion===
Although Gĩkũyũs historically adhered to indigenous faiths, most are Christians today, of varying denominations, as well as various syncretic forms of Christianity. A minority of the Kikuyu practice Islam, notably through Arab, Indian and Persian missionaries since trade with the rest of East Africa.

A small group of Kĩkũyũ, numbering about 60 people in 2015, practice Judaism in the town of Kusuku. While they practice a normative form of Judaism (similar to Conservative Judaism), they are not a recognized part of any larger Jewish group.

=== Religious and cultural discord ===
In April 2018, the Presbyterian Church of East Africa made a resolution to prohibit its members from the Kikuyu cultural rite known as &quot;Mburi cia Kiama&quot; and this triggered disturbances among devotees in the region of Mount Kenya. The &quot;Mburi cia Kiama&quot; entails the slaughtering of goats and advising men on how to become respected elders. When this process is over, they join different &quot;kiama&quot;s (groups). It is in these groups that they are given advice on issues like marriage, the Kikuyu culture and community responsibilities. Members of the church were given the ultimatum to renounce the cultural practice or to leave the church&#x27;s fold.

<text>Download is a Canadian electronic music group formed by Dwayne Goettel and Kevin Crompton (aka cEvin Key) of Skinny Puppy in 1994. The initial lineup also included, Off &amp; Gone&#x27;s Phil Western and Mark Spybey of Dead Voices on Air, but has since been particularly fluid, with Key and Western being the only constant members following Goettel&#x27;s death. Download&#x27;s music has been described as post-industrial, drawing from the band&#x27;s genesis as part of Skinny Puppy but also sharing common stylistic ground with such artists as Aphex Twin and Autechre. The primary instrumentation common throughout their albums is a blend of synthesizers and sampled instruments; the music is particularly centered on the elements of percussion and rhythm.

Other artists that have been involved are Genesis P. Orridge, Anthony Valcic, Bill Van Rooy, and Ken Marshall. Earlier releases frequently included vocal elements and lyrics, but since III (and Mark Spybey&#x27;s departure in 1996) their work has been strictly instrumental.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
As tensions within Skinny Puppy began to mount in the early nineties, band members Dwayne Goettel and cEvin Key began experimenting with musical improvisations that they felt were more true to their &quot;roots&quot;. Early on, the duo brought in Mark Spybey who Key had met in Vancouver some years previous through Spybey&#x27;s involvement with Zoviet France. The name for the band came from the last track on Skinny Puppy&#x27;s album &quot;Last Rights&quot;, an especially abstract track for the band produced by Goettel and Anthony Valcic.

=== &quot;Furnace&quot; and &quot;Microscopic&quot; ===
In the first era of Download&#x27;s career, the band&#x27;s sound was an Experimental Industrial style which featured vocals by Mark Spybey and guest vocals by Genesis P. Orridge. Their first LP, &quot;Furnace&quot;, was arguably their least accessible — most of the tracks lasted for over four minutes, some lasting as long as nine minutes. Their next release, the &quot;Microscopic EP&quot; continued this style. It featured three remixes of tracks from &quot;Furnace&quot; (only one of which was remixed by the band itself, the other two were remixed by Biosphere and Newt), along with five original tracks.

=== &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Family&quot; ===
&quot;Charlie&#x27;s Family&quot; was another experimental industrial LP by Download, except this LP was a soundtrack to the movie of the same name, and it had significantly different sound than the previous two releases. Instead of the beat-oriented music that dominated &quot;Furnace&quot; and &quot;Microscopic&quot;, this LP&#x27;s music was mostly dominated by a simple beat along with many samples of anything from women orgasming to airplanes taking off.

=== &quot;The Eyes of Stanley Pain&quot; and &quot;Sidewinder&quot; ===
&quot;The Eyes of Stanley Pain&quot;, arguably Download&#x27;s most diverse-sounding and accessible industrial album, was released in 1996. It spanned 14 tracks, most of which were about four or five minutes long. The only exceptions were the tracks &quot;Glassblower&quot; and &quot;Collision&quot;, which were 3:02 and 10:38, respectively. Later that year, the EP &quot;Sidewinder&quot; was released by the band. In the same vein as their first EP - &quot;Microscopic&quot; - it contained eight tracks, of which four were remixes. Three were remixes by Download of songs from &quot;The Eyes of Stanley Pain&quot;, and one was a remix of the song &quot;Attalal&quot; from &quot;Furnace&quot; by the band Haujobb (although the packaging of Sidewinder spells it &quot;Attallal&quot;). The other four songs were original songs recorded by Download, and the last of Download&#x27;s post-industrial era.

=== &quot;III&quot; and &quot;Effector&quot; ===
&quot;III&quot; marked a turning point for Download. Their sound became more melodic and accessible while still retaining the experimental quirks of their older material. Their next album &quot;Effector&quot; continued this direction and peaked at #12 on the CMJ RPM Charts in the U.S.

=== &quot;III Steps Forward&quot; and &quot;Inception&quot; ===
Two more albums, &quot;III Steps Forward&quot; and &quot;Inception&quot; were released as part of Subconscious Studio&#x27;s &quot;From The Vault&quot; series. &quot;Inception&quot; contained outtakes from Download&#x27;s more experimental early era, while &quot;III Steps Forward&quot; included outtakes from the &quot;III&quot; and &quot;Effector&quot; eras as well as new tracks. Although the original pressing of each was limited to 1000 copies, 2nd pressing editions are currently available from Subconscious Studio&#x27;s website.

=== &quot;Fixer&quot; ===
In December 2006, cEvin Key announced that new material has been recorded for a new album (titled &quot;Fixer&quot;). The album was released in April 2007.

=== &quot;HElicopTEr&quot; &amp; &quot;Wookie Wall&quot; ===
In late 2009, Subconscious Communications announced the release of the &quot;Beyond the Vault&quot; series. With it, a new Download album titled &quot;HElicopTEr&quot; was included in the series which was written by cEvin Key and Phil Western with a guest appearance by Mark Spybey. As stated on the official Subconscious Communications website, the album employs some of the oldest synthesizers the studio has in its collection. The result differs from the more ambient releases of &quot;Effector&quot; and &quot;Fixer&quot; and is more akin to Download&#x27;s previous works such as &quot;Furnace&quot; or &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Family&quot;.

Wookie Wall: For the 2010 &quot;SubCon Beyond Fest&quot;, a tour in support of the albums released in the Beyond The Vault series, Download announced plans to release an EP that would be sold during the tour. Though Download apparently went as far as to commission album art, the so-called &quot;Wookie Wall EP&quot; never materialized during the tour though the title track was integrated into the setlist. Supposedly the band considered the possibility of expanding Wookie Wall into its own full-length album, but in 2011 three of the proposed Wookie Wall tracks were added onto a re-release of Download&#x27;s Helicopter.

A special-edition of &quot;Furnace&quot; (&quot;Furnace Re:dux&quot;) was also released with Subconscious&#x27; From the Vault II series. The new release includes a second disc with a collection of the live jams and improvisations that were the basis of the finished album.

=== &quot;LingAM&quot; ===
On June 11, 2013, Download released their ninth studio album &quot;Lingam&quot;. In Hindu scripture, the lingam is the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva. &quot;Lingam&quot; employs some of the band&#x27;s more ambient styles featured on previous albums like &quot;Effector&quot; and &quot;Fixer&quot;.

=== &quot;Unknown Room&quot; ===
On March 8, 2019, Download released their eleventh studio album &quot;Unknown Room&quot;. From the bandcamp listing: &#x27;Unknown Room is the project&#x27;s 11th studio album, recorded in Los Angeles over a several-year period, culminating in a recent two-month session in the Fall that Key describes as being &quot;extremely intense.&quot; Unknown Room is the last album to feature Phil Western who died while the album was being prepared for release in 2019.

<doc id="177204" wikidata="Q745025" url="?curid=177204" title="Lombok Strait">
<text>The Lombok Strait () is a strait of the Bali Sea connecting to the Indian Ocean, and is located between the islands of Bali and Lombok in Indonesia. The Gili Islands are on the Lombok side.

Its narrowest point is at its southern opening, with a width of about between the islands of Lombok and Nusa Penida, in the middle of the strait. At the northern opening, it is across. Its total length is about . As it is minimum deep — much deeper than the Strait of Malacca — ships that draw too much water to pass through the Malacca Strait (so-called &quot;post Malaccamax&quot; vessels) often use the Lombok Strait, instead.

The Lombok Strait is notable as one of the main passages for the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) that exchanges water between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

It is also part of the biogeographical boundary between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The boundary is known as the Wallace Line, for Alfred Russel Wallace, who first remarked upon the striking difference between animals of Indomalaya and those of Australasia, and how abrupt the boundary was between the two biomes.

Biologists believe it was the depth of the Lombok Strait itself that kept the animals on either side isolated from one another. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, the islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra were all connected to one another and to the mainland of Asia. They shared the Asian fauna. The Lombok Strait&#x27;s deep water kept Lombok and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated from the Asian mainland. These islands were, instead, colonised by Australasian fauna.

== Marine biodiversity ==
The Lombok Strait is abundant of flora and fauna species which have been well explored through Bali’s diving tourism. As the Lombok Strait connects the Bali Sea to the Indian Ocean, the abundance of flora and fauna is due to its location between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, where the strait acts as a passage for currents. Accompanied by its flora and fauna is its marine habitats which vary in water temperature, its presence of volcanic and limestone sediments, local freshwater inflow between creeks, sandy reef slopes, and strong currents. According to the results obtained from a coral reef expedition conducted by the National Museum of Natural History-Naturalis Leiden, in partnership with the Research and Development Centre for Oceanology of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (PPPO-LIPI), Jakarta, and the WWF Indonesia-Wallacea Bioregion, Bali in April 2001, the coral reef fauna of the Lombok Strait was one of the most diverse and richest in the world. The diversity of its marine biogeography includes the following groups: stony corals (Scleractinia and hydrocorals), soft corals (Octocorallia), sponges (Porifera), forams (Foramanifera), shrimps (Decapoda), snails (Gastropoda), and fishes.

The Lombok Strait is part of the biogeographical boundary between the fauna of the Indomalayan realm and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The boundary is known as the Wallace Line, for Alfred Russel Wallace, who first remarked upon the striking difference between animals of Indomalaya and those of Australasia, and how abrupt the boundary was between the two biomes. When sea levels dropped during the Pleistocene ice age, the islands of Bali, Java and Sumatra were all connected to one another and to the mainland of Asia. They shared the Asian fauna. The Lombok Strait&#x27;s deep water kept Lombok and the Lesser Sunda archipelago isolated from the Asian mainland. These islands were instead, colonised by Australasian fauna.

The ocean surrounding the Indonesian archipelago is inhabited by 30 marine mammals. The diverse range of mammals include rare and endangered whales and dolphins. The endangered status of marine mammals in Indonesian waters is a consequence of the extreme fisheries activities undertaken along the strait waters, such as coastal net-entanglements and reef bombing. The statistics of fisheries activities along Indonesian waters was that an annual catch of more than 4.5 million tonnes occurred in 2006 and the catches between 1996-1997 included 1424 manta rays, 18 whale sharks, 312 other shark species, 4 minke whales, 326 dolphins, 577 pilot whales, 789 marlin, 84 turtles, and 9 dugongs. The Lombok Strait is abundantly inhabited by the longnosed spinner dolphin (S. longirostris) and is commonly inhabited by the pantropical spotted dolphin (S. attenuata), bottlenose dolphin (T. truncatus), and the Southeast Asian spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris roseiventris). The habitat of these cetacean species consist of large rivers, mangroves, and coastal environments.

Marine bacterial isolates are formed as a result of petroleum hydrocarbon contamination. According to a cruise investigation of the Indian Ocean and Lombok Strait conducted by the Institute for Marine Research and Observation, Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (BPOL-KKP), the bacteria present in the marine environment of Indonesia consisted of: Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., B. megaterium and Corynebacterium sp., through the enumeration and isolation of oil-degrading bacteria. Five distinct hydrocarbonoclastic marine bacterial species and two species from the Bacillus genera family, are bacterial strains that have been identified in the Lombok Strait. These bacterial strains have the potential to remediate the marine environment. The bacterial strains existing in Indonesian waters, including the Indian Ocean and the Lombok Strait, degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This is because majority of the world’s crude oil are traded along the route of the Lombok Strait. The cultivable marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria identified in the Lombok Strait specifically have six morphologies: LS-3, LS-13, LS-14, LS-15, LS-16, and LS-20. These colonies are discovered to have smooth and rippled surfaces and are of convex and raised elevation. They are found to be of various colours: yellow, opaque, white, and purple. Callidiopini species are identified to have been found on the islands of Bali and Lombok, which are divided by the Lombok Strait. One species of the Callidiopine fauna, Diatomocephala larvata (Ceresium larvatum) is unique to the Lombok Strait.

== Oceanic features ==

The Lombok Strait is notable as one of the main passages for the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) that exchanges water between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The formation of the Lombok Strait is influenced by oceanic tidal mixing, heat content of the water masses, and seasonal changes. As the Lombok Strait is situated between Bali and Lombok, it is an exit way for the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) which connects the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. As a result of this, oceanic tidal mixing occurs. Oceanic tidal mixing occurs in shallow seas and near-coastal areas. Tidal mixing can induce an oscillation in sea surface temperatures (SST) during the near-fortnightly spring-neap period. Tidal mixing in the waters of the Indonesian archipelago is particularly intense due to the rough topography in the Lifamatola, Manipa, Ombai, and Lombok Straits, and the Sibutu Island chains. The Lombok Strait is a strong tidal mixing hotspot. This is because numerical simulations have shown that there is a large conversion of semidiurnal M2 barotropic to baroclinic internal tides surrounding the Nusa Penida Sill (NPS).

The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) affects the climate of the region as it regulates the position of hot pools in the Indian Ocean. Climate change occurs as the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) contributes to the contained heat content in the strait and its sea surface temperatures (SST). The location of the strait causes the heat content of the water masses to be influenced by the monsoon season in Asia, and El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) which are climate phenomena. Moreover, the monsoon season from December to May causes precipitation to occur and fresh water to form at the Java Sea, which in turn, influences the salinity of the Lombok Strait. This makes the Lombok Strait distinct from other bodies of water along the Lesser Sunda Islands chain. The ocean heat content of the Lombok Strait is determined by ocean-atmosphere interactions. This is crucial to climate change because heat is mostly absorbed by the oceans, which cover 70% of the earth’s surface. An increase in ocean heat content accompanied by the melting of ice caps, leads to an increase in sea levels, which ultimately results to a disruption in ecosystems and the lifestyles of human life. The fortnightly cycles of the ocean’s sea surface temperatures (SST) and Bali’s atmosphere have a peak seasonal cycle, which takes place during boreal summer.

The monsoon season also determines the wave properties of the Lombok Strait. The arc-like internal wave and the irregular internal wave are wave patterns which occur as a result of seasonal influences. The tide flow is controlled through Nusa Penida Sill (NPS), reaching 350 m in depth. The Lombok Strait features strong semi-diurnal tides of ~90 m in amplitude with a distance of 30 km from the Nusa Penida Sill (NPS). The flow of the strait waters also makes it distinctive as it consists of a layered structure: the upper layer has a permanent southward flow and the lower layer has a reversing southward-northward flow.

== Maritime issues ==
As the Lombok Strait borders Indonesia, it is affected by maritime issues related to international trade. The UN Secretary General has identified seven threats to maritime security in the Report on Oceans and the Law of the Sea 2008, which are: terrorist acts against shipping, offshore installations and other maritime interests, illicit trafficking in weapons of mass destruction, illicit trafficking in drugs, human trafficking, IUU fishing, and unlawful damage to the marine environment. Issues particularly affecting the Lombok Strait include: piracy, illegal fishing, human trafficking, smuggling of goods, armed robberies and terrorism. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) reports that Indonesia had the highest incidents of piracy and armed robbery offshore. Maritime threats experienced by Indonesian waters is due to increasing economic development in the Asia-Pacific region, making Asia the most vulnerable place in the world in terms of security. As it is minimum 250 m (820 feet) deep — much deeper than the Strait of Malacca — ships that draw too much water to pass through the Malacca Strait (so-called &quot;post Malaccamax&quot; vessels) often use the Lombok Strait, instead. The Lombok Strait is proposed to become an alternative route for Chinese trading vessels passing the Malacca Strait. Indonesian waters also host four of the world’s nine choke points. These four choke points are used for national and international shipping routes. Indonesia as an archipelago, is responsible for maintaining security in the international shipping routes of the Archipelagic Sea Lanes (ASL), as stated by the 1982 United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

Due to the maritime issues experienced along the Lombok Strait, there is a need for Indonesia to establish management strategies. The strategies Indonesia has put in place to deal with maritime issues involves a policy established by President Joko Widodo, known as the Global Maritime Fulcrum. The policy is based on five pillars: redeveloping Indonesia’s maritime culture, building the maritime industry, prioritising fisheries, increasing shipping and port networks, improving maritime diplomacy and its defence forces. Improving defence forces at sea involves an emphasis in using the Indonesian navy to increase maritime security. Another strategy put in place by the Indonesian Government are designating areas called Marine Protective Areas (MPAs). As part of the internal policy in 2019, the Lombok Strait was announced to have been intended to be established as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). It has not been officially submitted to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Alongside implementing Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) as a maritime strategy for the Lombok Strait, is the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), which is a traffic management route system. The Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) supports Indonesia being recognised as an archipelagic state under the 1982 UNCLOS, as it aligns with Article 53 (6), which states the country’s right to improve navigation safety within the area of the Islands Sea Channel.

== Contribution to the economy ==
The Lombok Strait contributes to the economy of Indonesia and neighbouring Southeast Asian countries as it serves as a trading route alongside the Strait of Malacca, and as the island of Lombok transforms into a hub of tourism. According to Rizal Ramli, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Natural Resources in Indonesia, the Lombok Strait is proposed to become an alternative shipping route in place of the Malacca Strait. This is because the “Strait of Malacca has become narrow and shallower, and shipping traffic has become busy each year, which would increase the risk of vessel collisions.” With businesses supporting this shift, this would result in Indonesia becoming one of the world’s biggest bunkering ports alongside Singapore.

As the Malacca Strait would no longer be able to cope with shipping traffic by the next 10–20 years, the Indonesian Government encourages voyages to pass through the Lombok Strait instead. As a result of increased shipping activity, the issue of maritime threats and marine pollution are introduced. In response to these arising maritime issues, the Indonesian Government has proposed to establish Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) in its internal policy. Establishing the Lombok Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) contributes to the growth of the tuna fishing industry. This is due to the location of the Lombok Strait, as it is situated within the triangle of coral reefs (CT) area. The rich marine biodiversity of the Coral Triangle (CT) area is an essential tuna breeding ground for the outsourcing of the world’s tuna fishing industry. The growth of the tuna fishing industry in turn, contributes to the economy as it provides food security and income for residents along the coastline of Coral Triangle (CT) areas, and because the tuna breeding sites are foundational sources for tuna fishing companies who are producing tuna for consumers around the world. Healthy marine resources such as tuna breeding grounds further contribute to the growth of the tourism industry, as a result of establishing the Lombok Strait as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).

<text>VoiceXML (VXML) is a digital document standard for specifying interactive media and voice dialogs between humans and computers. It is used for developing audio and voice response applications, such as banking systems and automated customer service portals. VoiceXML applications are developed and deployed in a manner analogous to how a web browser interprets and visually renders the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) it receives from a web server. VoiceXML documents are interpreted by a voice browser and in common deployment architectures, users interact with voice browsers via the public switched telephone network (PSTN).

The VoiceXML document format is based on Extensible Markup Language (XML). It is a standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

==Usage==
VoiceXML applications are commonly used in many industries and segments of commerce. These applications include order inquiry, package tracking, driving directions, emergency notification, wake-up, flight tracking, voice access to email, customer relationship management, prescription refilling, audio news magazines, voice dialing, real-estate information and national directory assistance applications. 

VoiceXML has tags that instruct the voice browser to provide speech synthesis, automatic speech recognition, dialog management, and audio playback. The following is an example of a VoiceXML document:
&lt;vxml version=&quot;2.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/vxml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;form&gt;
 &lt;block&gt;
 &lt;prompt&gt;
 Hello world!
 &lt;/prompt&gt;
 &lt;/block&gt;
 &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/vxml&gt;
When interpreted by a VoiceXML interpreter this will output &quot;Hello world&quot; with synthesized speech.

Typically, HTTP is used as the transport protocol for fetching VoiceXML pages. Some applications may use static VoiceXML pages, while others rely on dynamic VoiceXML page generation using an application server like Tomcat, Weblogic, IIS, or WebSphere.

Historically, VoiceXML platform vendors have implemented the standard in different ways, and added proprietary features. But the VoiceXML 2.0 standard, adopted as a W3C Recommendation on 16 March 2004, clarified most areas of difference. The VoiceXML Forum, an industry group promoting the use of the standard, provides a conformance testing process that certifies vendors&#x27; implementations as conformant.

==History==
AT&amp;T Corporation, IBM, Lucent, and Motorola formed the VoiceXML Forum in March 1999, in order to develop a standard markup language for specifying voice dialogs. By September 1999 the Forum released VoiceXML 0.9 for member comment, and in March 2000 they published VoiceXML 1.0. Soon afterwards, the Forum turned over the control of the standard to the W3C. The W3C produced several intermediate versions of VoiceXML 2.0, which reached the final &quot;Recommendation&quot; stage in March 2004.

VoiceXML 2.1 added a relatively small set of additional features to VoiceXML 2.0, based on feedback from implementations of the 2.0 standard. It is backward compatible with VoiceXML 2.0 and reached W3C Recommendation status in June 2007.

==Future versions of the standard==
VoiceXML 3.0 was slated to be the next major release of VoiceXML, with new major features. However, with the disbanding of the VoiceXML Forum in May 2022, the development of the new standard was scrapped.

==Implementations==
As of December 2022, there are few VoiceXML 2.0/2.1 platform implementations being offered.
*Hewlett-Packard (OCMP)
*OnMobile (Ozone Speech Platform)
*Alvaria
*Avaya (Avaya Experience Portal)
*OpenVXI
*Cisco
*Genesys (company)
*Nuance Communications
*Phonologies
*Plum Voice
*Telesoft Technologies

== Related standards ==
The W3C&#x27;s Speech Interface Framework also defines these other standards closely associated with VoiceXML.

=== SRGS and SISR ===
The Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) is used to tell the speech recognizer what sentence patterns it should expect to hear: these patterns are called grammars. Once the speech recognizer determines the most likely sentence it heard, it needs to extract the semantic meaning from that sentence and return it to the VoiceXML interpreter. This semantic interpretation is specified via the Semantic Interpretation for Speech Recognition (SISR) standard. SISR is used inside SRGS to specify the semantic results associated with the grammars, i.e., the set of ECMAScript assignments that create the semantic structure returned by the speech recognizer.

=== SSML ===
The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is used to decorate textual prompts with information on how best to render them in synthetic speech, for example which speech synthesizer voice to use or when to speak louder or softer.

=== PLS ===
The Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS) is used to define how words are pronounced. The generated pronunciation information is meant to be used by both speech recognizers and speech synthesizers in voice browsing applications.

=== CCXML ===
The Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML) is a complementary W3C standard. A CCXML interpreter is used on some VoiceXML platforms to handle the initial call setup between the caller and the voice browser, and to provide telephony services like call transfer and disconnect to the voice browser. CCXML can also be used in non-VoiceXML contexts.

=== MSML, MSCML, MediaCTRL ===
In media server applications, it is often necessary for several call legs to interact with each other, for example in a multi-party conference. Some deficiencies were identified in VoiceXML for this application and so companies designed specific scripting languages to deal with this environment. The Media Server Markup Language (MSML) was Convedia&#x27;s solution, and Media Server Control Markup Language (MSCML) was Snowshore&#x27;s solution. Snowshore is now owned by Dialogic and Convedia is now owned by Radisys. These languages also contain &#x27;hooks&#x27; so that external scripts (like VoiceXML) can run on call legs where IVR functionality is required.

There was an IETF working group called &quot;mediactrl&quot; (&quot;media control&quot;) that was working on a successor for these scripting systems, which it is hoped will progress to an open and widely adopted standard. The mediactrl working group concluded in 2013.

<doc id="177207" wikidata="Q848645" url="?curid=177207" title="Karimata Strait">
<text>The Karimata Strait (alternatively, Carimata or Caramata; ) is a wide strait that connects the South China Sea to the Java Sea, separating the Indonesian islands of Belitung to the west and Borneo (Kalimantan) to the east. It is the widest strait between the South China Sea and the Java Sea (other straits include the Bangka and Gaspar straits), but its numerous islands and reefs reduce its navigability. Its weather and current is influenced by the annual southeast and northwest monsoon.

It was used as an invasion route by the British fleet in the 1811 Invasion of Java in the Dutch East Indies. More recently, it was the site of the crash of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, and the location of the 2016 edition of Sail Indonesia (dubbed &quot;Sail Karimata Strait&quot;).

== Geography ==
The strait is about wide from the east coast of Belitung (also known as Billiton) to the west coast of Borneo (Kalimantan). The much narrower Gaspar Strait separates Belitung from Bangka Island to the west. Bangka lies close to the east coast of Sumatra, separated from it by the Bangka Strait. To the east of Belitung lie reefs and a group of islets known as the Montaran Islands, extending up to from Belitung&#x27;s northeastern coast. The Karimata Islands lie in the eastern part of the Karimata Strait, northeast of Belitung, southwest of Maja Island, and off-shore from the west coast of Borneo. The presence of these islands and reefs reduce the width of the main navigable channel to about . Outside this main fairway, there are multiple navigable channels to the east of Karimata Islands or between the islands.

The Rivers Kapuas, Kendawangan, Pawan, and Sambas (in Borneo), as well as the Rivers Barumun and Musi (in Sumatra) empty to the strait.

=== Climate ===
The southeast monsoon prevails in the strait from about the end of May, which comes with strong southeast or south-southeast wind, a dry weather, and mist that can obscure visibility. The northwest monsoon comes from the beginning of October, characterized by thunderstorms, rain and squalls alternating with calm days with fair weather. The biggest rainfall occur from November to February. From February, the weather becomes unpredictable because of the changing monsoon, before settling again around the end of May.

=== Currents and water transport ===
The current strength of the strait vary depending on the monsoon wind. At the peak of either monsoon, the current can run up to When the monsoon is light, &quot;there is little or no current&quot; and the direction may be subject to the tidal stream.

The strait&#x27;s currents run between the South China Sea to its north and the Java Sea to its south. Since it is relatively shallow, with the depth of or less, the volume transported by the current is relatively small. A 2007–2008 study by a group of Indonesian and Chinese researchers found that the transport volume averaged 500,000 m3/second (or 0.5 Sv) with a net southward direction (i.e. to the Java Sea). During the northern hemisphere winter, roughly during the northwest monsoon, water flowed southward averaging 2.7 Sv. The flow was reversed during the northern hemisphere summer, roughly during the southwest monsoon, with an average transport of 1.2 Sv.

== History ==

It was known to British sailors in the 18th and 19th centuries as the Caramata Passage. The strait was used as a route by the British fleet for its Invasion of Java (1811), sailing from the British base in Malacca to the island of Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies. Initially, the British were unsure of the strait&#x27;s practicability, and hesitated between taking it or a northeast passage around the north of Borneo and through Makassar Strait. A report by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, then a British officer in Malacca, recommended taking the Karimata route, which he considered &quot;less dangerous than tedious&quot; than the northeast passage during that time of year. Raffles estimated that this journey would take the British fleet between a month and six weeks for &quot;the fleet sailing in divisions&quot;. The British Governor-General of India The Lord Minto decided to take Raffles&#x27;s suggestion over the objection of some naval officers. The fleet, numbering about 100 vessels and transporting about 11,000 troops, departed Malacca between 11 and 18 June 1811, and reached the coast of Java on 30 July after a smooth journey, exactly six weeks after Minto and Raffles&#x27; departure.

A 1915 publication by the United States Hydrographic Office commented that despite being much wider, the strait did not have as much traffic as the parallel Bangka or Gaspar Straits. The publication said that the advantage of its breadth was often outweighed by the danger posed by shoals in the strait, as well as its more irregular currents.

== Recent events ==
On 28 December 2014 Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed into the strait, after losing contact over the Java Sea while en route to Singapore from Surabaya, East Java. All 162 passengers and crew aboard the plane perished, however, only 116 were physically recovered by the time search-and-rescue operations concluded in March 2015.

Sail Indonesia (2016), also dubbed &quot;Sail Karimata Strait 2016&quot;, was a sailboat competition held within the strait. Four Indonesian provinces—on both sides of the strait (West Kalimantan, Jambi, Bangka Belitung and the Riau Islands, respectively)—hosted the race, with the peak event having taken place on 15 October on Datuk Island, North Kayong Regency, West Kalimantan.

<text>Ashby-de-la-Zouch (), also spelled Ashby de la Zouch, is a market town and civil parish in the North West Leicestershire district of Leicestershire, England, near to the Derbyshire and Staffordshire borders. Its population at the 2021 census was 16,491. Ashby de la Zouch Castle was an important fort in the 15th to 17th centuries. During the 19th century, the town&#x27;s main industry was ribbon manufacturing. 

The civil parish includes the hamlets of Shellbrook to the west and Boundary to the north-west. Swadlincote, Burton upon Trent, Melbourne and Coalville are within , with Derby due north. It lies at the heart of the National Forest, south of the Peak District National Park, on the A42 between Tamworth and Nottingham.

==History==

The town was known as Ashby in 1086. This is a word of Anglo-Danish origin, meaning &quot;Ash-tree farm&quot; or &quot;Ash-tree settlement&quot;. The Norman French name extension dates from the years after the Norman conquest of England, when Ashby became a possession of the La Zouche family during the reign of Henry III.

Ashby de la Zouch Castle was built in the 12th century. The town and castle came into the possession of the Hastings family in 1464 and William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings enhanced its fortifications from 1473. In the English Civil War, the town was one of the Cavaliers&#x27; chief garrisons under the control of Colonel Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough and commander of the North Midlands Army. When the town fell after a long siege in March 1646, it was counted a great relief to the surrounding towns and villages.

Many of the buildings in Market Street, the town&#x27;s main thoroughfare, are timber framed. Most of this structure is hidden by later brick facades. &quot;The Bull&#x27;s Head&quot; public house retains its original Elizabethan half-timbering, although most of this was plastered over some years ago and can no longer be seen from the street. A short distance further down Market Street is a shop, currently occupied as a LOROS Charity Shop, which retains its original Elizabethan timbers in full street view. Regency buildings are also standing in this street. Bath Street has a row of Classical-style houses called &quot;Rawdon Terrace&quot;, dating from the time of the 1820s, when the town was a spa destination.

==Governance==
The town has a town council, the lowest level of local government in England. This has 17 councillors, representing six wards: Blackfordby ward (2 councillors), Castle ward (3), Holywell ward (3), Ivanhoe ward (3), Money Hill ward (3) and Willesley ward (3).

The town is in North West Leicestershire district. The district council has 38 wards which each elect one councillor, and these include wards named Ashby Castle, Ashby Holywell, Ashby Ivanhoe, Ashby Money Hill, Ashby Willesley and Ashby Woulds (ie a similar list to the town council wards but including Woulds instead of Blackfordby). It is represented on Leicestershire County Council by one councillor representing the electoral division named Ashby de la Zouch, one of 55 divisions.

The town is in the parliamentary constituency of North West Leicestershire, represented since 2024 by Amanda Hack of the Labour Party.

==Notable buildings==
===Churches===


St Helen&#x27;s Church is Ashby&#x27;s original Anglican parish church. It is a late 15th-century Perpendicular Gothic building. The outer aisles were designed by J. P. St. Aubyn and added in 1878. St. Helen&#x27;s contains notable memorials to various members of the Hastings family and other notables. It also holds a rare 300-year-old finger pillory.

Holy Trinity Church is a Gothic Revival building designed by H. I. Stevens in the Early English Gothic style and built in 1838–40. It has galleries supported by iron columns. The chancel was added in 1866 and the ironwork chancel screen in 1891.

The Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Lourdes was designed by F. A. Walters and built in 1908–15 at the expense of the 15th Duke of Norfolk. It is neo-Norman, with three apses and a tower at the southeast corner.

The Congregational Church was built in 1825 in a neoclassical style with Tuscan columns. There is also a Christadelphian meeting hall in the town.

===Ivanhoe Baths===

The Ivanhoe Baths was an 1822 Neo-Grecian building with a Doric façade long. Unused, it was derelict by 1960, and was demolished in 1962. Mineworkers discovered a copious saline spring when working coal at Moira Colliery, west of the town, in 1805. Here developers built the Moira Baths, with a large hotel nearby for travellers. After a few years, however, it was decided to convey the water to Ashby, where the Ivanhoe Baths were built. The Royal Hotel, originally called the Hastings Hotel, was built in 1826 to accommodate visitors to the growing spa. It has a Doric porte-cochère and additional Doric columns in its hall inside. The hotel closed in February 2018.

===Water tower===
The Grade II-listed, 19th-century water tower, located in the town&#x27;s cemetery on Moira Road, has been converted into a dwelling. The conversion was controversial since it involved a number of modern additions to the building.

===Loudoun Monument===
In 1879, Baron Donington, the widowed husband of Edith Rawdon-Hastings, 10th Countess of Loudoun, had the Loudoun monument erected to her memory in Ashby. The octagonal monument by Sir George Gilbert Scott is based on the Eleanor crosses and is a Listed building. It is located at the junction of Bath and South Streets, opposite the Roman Catholic church.

===Ashby-de-la-Zouch Town Hall===

Ashby-de-la-Zouch Town Hall, which was built at the same time as the market hall to its rear, dates to 1857.

==Education==
The town has two secondary schools: 

*Ashby School, previously Ashby Grammar School, is for 11–18-year-olds. It was founded in 1567. The town formerly had two other endowed boys&#x27; schools founded in the 18th century.

*Ivanhoe School, previously Ivanhoe College, is for 11 to 16-year-olds. It was founded in 1954. It is named after the historical novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, which he set in the area of the castle. In Scott&#x27;s novel the town hosts an important archery competition held by Prince John, in which Robin Hood competes and wins.

Manor House School was an independent day school in the centre of Ashby for boys and girls aged four to 16. The school was located between St Helen&#x27;s Church and the ruins of Ashby&#x27;s historic castle. Pupils travelled to the school from a wide area. The school entered into administration on 13 December 2018.

==Business==
In the 19th century, Ashby&#x27;s main industry was leather working. There was also a cotton textile factory and a glue factory. Ashby was surrounded by coalmines but was never a coalmining town itself. By far the largest employer in the town today is United Biscuits, providing about 2,000 jobs at its distribution centre, which stores its products and transports them nationwide, and its KP Snacks factory in Smisby Road. The firm formerly had a larger presence in Ashby. McVitie&#x27;s biscuit factory on Smisby Road closed in 2004 with the loss of 900 jobs.

Other employers in Ashby include Tesco, Ashfield Commercial &amp; Medical Services, Timeline Communications, Eduteq Limited and TAC UK Ltd, a firm of energy consultants. Standard Soap Ltd, a significant industrial employer within Ashby-de-la-Zouch since 1928, closed in early 2012, resulting in the loss of 155 jobs. The town has a concentration of high-tech employers. The video game software house Ultimate Play the Game was based in Ashby. Now called Rare, it has moved to Manor Park near Twycross.

==Recreation==

Ashby United Community Football Club is a community club for juniors and seniors of all ages. They play across multiple divisions across all of their Junior and Senior teams and are seen as leading the way in community inclusion when it comes to football and sports in the town.

Willesley Park Golf Course is set in rolling countryside, partly in parkland and partly on heathland, covering 230 acres of gentle undulating countryside. The course was opened for play in April 1921. The first hole is played along an avenue of lime trees which once flanked the old coach road from the old Norman castle in the town to the now demolished Willesley Hall.

Ashby Hastings Cricket Club was founded before 1831. Its ground, the Bath Grounds in the centre of Ashby, hosts Leicestershire CCC 2nd XI matches each year. The club runs three Saturday League sides, all of which play in the Everard&#x27;s Leicestershire County Cricket League. The 1st XI play in the Premier Division, the highest level of club cricket available in Leicestershire, the 2nd XI play in Division 4 and the 3rd XI play in Division 8. The club also run a Midweek XI who play in the Premier Division of the Loughborough Cricket Association League and a Sunday XI who play friendly cricket. The club&#x27;s Junior Section includes sides at Under 15, Under 13, Under 11 and Under 10 age groups. A second club, Ashby Town Cricket Club was formed in 1945.

Ashby RFC has its grounds in Nottingham Road. It plays in the League Midland 3 East (North). It also has mini and junior sections for girls and boys from age four, as well as seniors and seconds side and an O2 Touch team for players of all ages and both genders.

The town also has a bridge club (Ashby Bridge Club), and a hockey club (Ashby Hockey Club)

A greyhound racing track was opened on 3 April 1931. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. Racing was held on Tuesday and Saturday evenings and distances included 200, 350, 550 and 525 yards. The date of closure is thought to be around 1935.

Ivanhoe Runners, established in 1985 as a road, cross-country and social running club is a thriving and well respected running club based in Ashby de la Zouch. The club organises the annual Ashby 20 mile road race event, usually held five weeks ahead of the London Marathon. The perfect final pre-marathon race preparation or a challenging goal in itself. Set on a testing undulating route the race, organised for runners by runners is well established on the athletics calendar and sells out quickly. For many years the race has been sponsored by ALDI, and uniquely rewards finishers with a famous Ashby 20 hoody instead of a medal along with a well earned cheese cob. As recognition for the race’s outstanding organisation, with well stocked water stations and incredibly enthusiast marshals the race has received the highest Gold BARR grading annually since 2006. In 2017 the Ashby 20 was awarded the Bill Reynolds award for excellence recognising its excellent organisation, medical and emergency provision and community links. Each year,vthe race is supported by a number of local organisations such as Leicestershire Search and Rescue, Ashby Endurance Explorer Scouts, the Rotary Club of Ashby Castle, Ashby Town Council, North West Leicestershire District Council, Derby Runner, Conkers parkrun and Heartwize Runners .

==Transport==
The town was to be served by Ashby Canal from 1804 but the canal never reached Ashby, as it was constructed only to the village of Moira. The town was served by the Leicester–Burton upon Trent line of the Midland Railway and had its own station. After the canal was abandoned in stages between 1944 and 1966, British Railways withdrew the passenger service and closed Ashby de la Zouch railway station in September 1964. The railway remains open for freight. There were also connections to both the Melbourne Line and Ashby and Nuneaton Joint Railway connecting the town with the towns of Melbourne, Market Bosworth, Hinckley and Nuneaton as well as the city of Derby, but these lines closed between the 1950s and 1980s. Both of the lines now form footpaths with some of the old stations still present but others demolished.

In the 1990s, BR planned to restore passenger services between Leicester and Burton as the second phase of its Ivanhoe Line project. However, after the privatisation of British Rail in 1995, this phase of the project was shelved. In 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a £49-million proposal to restore passenger services to the line, which would include reopening a station at Ashby.

The nearest railway station is , away. The fastest train to London in the mornings and evenings is from Tamworth (12 miles from Ashby) to Euston at 1hr 2mins average non-stop at peak hours.
The A50 Leicester to Stoke-on-Trent road and the A453 Birmingham to Nottingham road used to pass through the town centre. The heavy traffic, which previously travelled through the town, has been greatly relieved by the A42 and A511 bypasses, which replace the A453 and A50, respectively.

Bus routes provide an hourly direct service to Burton-upon-Trent, Coalville, East Midlands Airport, Leicester and Swadlincote (Diamond East Midlands 9 and 19, and Arriva Midlands 29, 29A and X29). The National Express coach network is available in Leicester, which has a daily direct service to London.

East Midlands Airport is north-east of Ashby. It provides flights to and from other parts of the UK and Europe. For International travellers, Birmingham Airport is 26 miles away (c. 30 mins) and provides international flights.

==Media==
Television signals can only be received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter which broadcast programmes from Birmingham. However, BBC East Midlands and ITV Central are also received through cable and satellite television such as Freesat and Sky.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leicester, Smooth East Midlands, Capital Midlands, Hits Radio East Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands, and Hermitage FM, a community based station. 

Local newspapers are Ashby Nub News and Leicester Mercury. 

==Culture==
Every May, Ashby holds an arts festival sponsored by the district council. This features local artists, musicians, songwriters, poets, performers, and story tellers. The multiple sites around the town host exhibitions, musical performances, workshops and talks, and the town centre is decorated with flags and an outdoor gallery.

Ashby Statutes, a travelling funfair, is held every September. Instituted by Royal Statute, it was originally a hiring fair, where domestic servants and farmworkers would be hired for the year. During the fair in the 21st century, Market Street, the main road through the town (the former A50 trunk road), is closed for nearly a week. The traffic is diverted along narrower roads either side of Market Street. Locals call this event &quot;The Statutes&quot;.

A song &quot;Ashby de la Zouch (Castle Abbey)&quot;, written by Al Hoffman, Milton Drake and Jerry Livingston, was recorded by the Merry Macs in 1946 on Decca No. 18811. It includes the lines &quot;If you wanna smooch and be happy as a pooch, go to Ashby de la Zouch by the sea.&quot; (Ashby-de-la-Zouch is close to the centre of England, almost as far from the sea as is possible.) In April 1946 the American jazz bassist and composer Charles Mingus recorded a tune called &quot;Ashby de la Zouch&quot; with his band. The title or choice of song could have been an acknowledgement of guitarist Irving Ashby, who took part in the recording. Ashby-de-la-Zouch is twinned with Pithiviers in north-central France.

Ashby-de-la-Zouch is mentioned in Ivanhoe, the novel by Sir Walter Scott set in 1194, as &quot;the lists at Ashby&quot; and as “the lists at Ashby-de-la-Zouch”, suggesting that jousting may once have taken place in the town (&quot;lists&quot; being the barriers through which the respective steeds charge during a joust). The same phrase is used in the original computer game Defender of the Crown, which apparently drew inspiration from Scott&#x27;s novel.

<doc id="177211" wikidata="Q769580" url="?curid=177211" title="Breedon on the Hill">
<text>Breedon on the Hill is a village and civil parish about north of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in North West Leicestershire, England. The parish adjoins the Derbyshire county boundary and the village is only about south of the Derbyshire town of Melbourne. The 2001 Census recorded a parish population (including Isley and Wilson) of 958 people in 404 households. The parish includes the hamlets of Tonge east of the village and Wilson north of the village on the county boundary. The population at the 2011 census (including Isley cum Langley and Langley Priory) was 1,029 in 450 households.

==Geography==
Breedon is notable for its Carboniferous limestone hill that rises above sea level in a generally low-lying landscape and affords distant views across several counties. A large portion of the hill has been cut away by an active quarry now operated by the Breedon Group. This currently produces limestone and gravel. It has also produced sand.

On top of the hill is The Bulwarks Iron Age hill fort, within which is Breedon&#x27;s historic Church of England parish church. A recent survey found considerable evidence of occupation within the southern part of the hillfort enclosure.

Breedon is from East Midlands Airport and from the junction of the A42 road and M1 motorway. The village is from the River Trent, and from Donington Park motor circuit.

==History==
Excavation of The Bulwarks in 1946 identified occupation between about the 1st century BC and about 1st century AD.

The toponym is derived from the Celtic word &quot;bre&quot; for hill and the Old English word &quot;dun&quot; for hill. Hence in its current form the name combines three forms of the word hill. &quot;Briudun&quot;, an early spelling, has been traced from AD 731.

Medieval hagiography manuscripts record four saints buried in Breedon on the Hill. They are Friduricus, donor of the Mercian royal monastery built in Breedon during the seventh century, King Eardwulf of Northumbria, and relatively unknown Anglo-Saxon Saints Beonna of Breedon and Cotta of Breedon.

Breedon has a circular stone-built village lock-up with an adjoining animal pound. The lock-up is 18th-century and similar to the one in the nearby Worthington. It was used for detaining local drunks, and the adjoining pound for straying livestock. The lock-up and pound together comprise a Grade II listed building.

Breedon Hall is an historic building which was the ancestral home of the Curzon family.

In 1874, a branch of the Midland Railway was built through the eastern part of the parish and Tonge and Breedon railway station was built at Tonge. In 1980 British Rail closed the line and later the track was dismantled. The trackbed through the parish is now part of National Cycle Route 6.

==Breedon Priory Church==

The Priory Church of St Mary and St Hardulph was originally a monastery founded in about AD 676 on the site of The Bulwarks, an Iron Age hill fort. It was re-founded as an Augustinian priory early in the 12th century. Before becoming a monastery it was a hermitage.

In 1498 members of the visiting Battenberg family took mass at the church on a number of occasions.

What remains of the priory church includes a large number of Anglo-Saxon sculptures, an ornate family box pew and notable Renaissance church monuments.

==Amenities==
Breedon has two pubs: the Holly Bush and the Three Horseshoes. There was a third pub, The Lime Kiln, but this is now a private home.

The village has a small primary school and a post office. It did have a butcher&#x27;s shop, but that closed in 2017. The school, St Hardulph&#x27;s Church of England Primary School, was built in 1962 and also housed community facilities. Relations between the school, Leicestershire County Council and the local community association subsequently broke down and the community association was unsuccessful in a high court application arguing that they had the right to use the facilities on the grounds that the community had contributed some of the funding for the construction of the building.

Breedon has a football club, Breedon F.C.

<doc id="177213" wikidata="Q13450283" url="?curid=177213" title="Wetsuit">
<text>A wetsuit is a garment worn to provide thermal protection while wet. It is usually made of foamed neoprene, and is worn by surfers, divers, windsurfers, canoeists, and others engaged in water sports and other activities in or on the water. Its purpose is to provide thermal insulation and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure, and stings from marine organisms. It also contributes extra buoyancy. The insulation properties of neoprene foam depend mainly on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water.

Hugh Bradner, a University of California, Berkeley physicist, invented the modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later spandex (also known as lycra). Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blind-stitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce &quot;flushing&quot;, the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles, and zippers produced a suit known as a &quot;semi-dry&quot;.

Different types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures. Suits range from a thin 2mm or less &quot;shortie&quot;, covering just the torso, upper arm, and thighs, to thick 8mm semi-dry suit covering the torso, arms, and legs, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood. The type of the suit depends upon the temperature of the water and the depth of the planned dive.

The difference between a wetsuit and a dry suit is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, though good fit limits water circulation inside the suit, and between the inside and outside of the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness. Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters. Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to use, but can be used where protection from lower temperatures or contaminated water is needed.

==Uses==
The primary function of a wetsuit is thermal insulation to keep the wearer warm in conditions where they would otherwise lose body heat rapidly due to heat transfer by relatively large quantities of water. Secondary, and incidental, functions are buoyancy and protection from some environmental hazards such as abrasion, sunburn, and to a lesser extent, wind chill. Wetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water, or frequently doused with heavy spray, often approaching from near-horizontal directions, where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out. Activities include underwater diving, sailing, sea rescue operations, surfing, river rafting, whitewater kayaking and in some circumstances, endurance swimming.
==Insulation==

Still water (without currents or convection) conducts heat away from the body by pure thermal diffusion, approximately 20 to 25 times more efficiently than still air. Water has a thermal conductivity of 0.58 Wm−1K−1 while still air has a thermal conductivity of 0.024 Wm−1K−1, so an unprotected person can eventually succumb to hypothermia even in warmish water on a warm day. Wetsuits are made of closed-cell foam neoprene, a synthetic rubber that contains small bubbles of nitrogen gas when made for use as insulating material (neoprene is also manufactured without foaming for many other applications where insulating qualities are not important). Nitrogen, like most gases, has very low thermal conductivity compared to water or to solids, and the small and enclosed nature of the gas bubbles minimizes heat transport through the gas by convection in the same way that cloth fabrics, fur, or feathers insulate by reducing convection of enclosed air spaces. The result is that the gas-filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction, which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas, thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body (or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit.

Uncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054 Wm−1K−1, which produces about twice the heat loss of still air, or one-tenth the loss of water. However, at a depth of about of water, the thickness of a typical neoprene foam will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50%, allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface. The grade of foam neoprene strongly affects insulating properties at depth, and over time. Softer, lighter, and more elastic grades contain a higher percentage of gas bubbles, and are comfortable and provide effective insulation at or near the surface where they retain much of their thickness. Areas that are significantly stretched lose thickness even before they are compressed at depth, which also reduces the insulation, and long periods under pressure and repeated compression and decompression of the neoprene foam will eventually lead to loss of volume, insulation, buoyancy and flexibility. Some bubbles will also rupture under stress and lose their gas, and the foam will start to absorb more water, further reducing insulation. Wetsuits for diving should be made from less compressible neoprene to keep their insulating qualities.

A wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves. Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion. The elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes, but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety. Places where the suit bridges a hollow tend to change volume when the wearer bends that part of the body, and the change in volume of the space under the suit works as a pump to push warm water out of the suit and suck cold water in on the opposite movement.

==Buoyancy==

Foamed neoprene is very buoyant, helping swimmers to stay afloat, and for this reason divers need to carry extra weight based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral buoyancy near the surface. Buoyancy is reduced by compression, and is proportional to depth and the amount of gas in the bubbles, and scuba divers can correct this by inflating the buoyancy compensator. Breath-hold divers do not have this option and have the handicap of reduced buoyancy at depth due to lung gas compression in addition to suit volume loss. The suit also loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth. 

Measurements of volume change of neoprene foam used for wetsuits under hydrostatic compression shows that about 30% of the volume, and therefore 30% of surface buoyancy, is lost in about the first 10 m, another 30% by about 60 m, and the volume appears to stabilize at about 65% loss by about 100 m. The total buoyancy loss of a wetsuit is proportional to the initial uncompressed volume. An average person has a surface area of about 2 m2, so the uncompressed volume of a full one piece 6 mm thick wetsuit will be in the order of 1.75 x 0.006 = 0.0105 m3, or roughly 10 liters. The mass will depend on the specific formulation of the foam, but will probably be in the order of 4 kg, for a net buoyancy of about 6 kg at the surface. Depending on the overall buoyancy of the diver, this will generally require 6 kg of additional weight to bring the diver to neutral buoyancy to allow reasonably easy descent. The volume lost at 10 m is about 3 liters, or 3 kg of buoyancy, rising to about 6 kg buoyancy lost at about 60 m. This could nearly double for a large person wearing a farmer-john and jacket for cold water. This loss of buoyancy must be balanced by inflating the buoyancy compensator to maintain neutral buoyancy at depth.

There is also a buoyancy loss due to gas loss from the bubbles over time, and the neoprene also loses flexibility with time, and tends to stiffen and shrink. This tendency is exacerbated by frequent use, deep dives, and exposure to sunlight. The &quot;compressed neoprene&quot; and &quot;crushed neoprene&quot; used for hot water suits and dry suits, is permanently reduced in volume by intentional hydrostatic compression during the manufacturing process, specifically to reduce buoyancy change with depth, at the cost of reducing insulation.

==History==

===Origins===
In 1952, UC Berkeley and subsequent UC San Diego SIO physicist Hugh Bradner, who is considered to be the original inventor and &quot;father of the modern wetsuit,&quot; had the insight that a thin layer of trapped water could be tolerated between the suit fabric and the skin, so long as sufficient insulation was present in the fabric of the suit. In this case, the water would quickly reach skin temperature and gas bubbles in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way. In the popular mind, the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation, but Bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric. He initially sent his ideas to Lauriston C. &quot;Larry&quot; Marshall who was involved in a U.S. Navy/National Research Council Panel on Underwater Swimmers. However, it was Willard Bascom, an engineer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, who suggested foamed neoprene as a feasible material to Bradner.

Bradner and Bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public. They attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design, but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a flight suit. The United States Navy also turned down Bradner&#x27;s and Bascom&#x27;s offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater sonar. The first written documentation of Bradner&#x27;s invention was in a letter to Marshall, dated June 21, 1951.

Jack O&#x27;Neill started using closed-cell neoprene foam which he claimed was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend, Harry Hind, who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work. After experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams, O&#x27;Neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot; in a San Francisco garage in 1952, later relocating to Santa Cruz, California in 1959 with the motto &quot;It&#x27;s Always Summer on the Inside&quot;. Bob and Bill Meistrell, from Manhattan Beach, California, also started experimenting with neoprene around 1953. They started a company which would later be named Body Glove.

Neoprene was not the only material used in early wetsuits, particularly in Europe and Australia. The Pêche-Sport &quot;isothermic&quot; suit invented by Georges Beuchat in 1953 and the UK-made Siebe Gorman Swimsuit were both made out of sponge rubber. The Heinke Dolphin Suit of the same period, also made in England, came in a green male and a white female version, both manufactured from natural rubber lined with stockinet. As early as July 1951, underwater hunters in Australia were experimenting with a natural rubber wetsuit &quot;of a &#x27;wrap on&#x27; variety, which does not set out to be 100% waterproof (but it is claimed that) the leakage of water through it is so slow that body warmth under it is maintained for hours.&quot; By May 1953, the Bondi underwater equipment manufacturer Undersee Products was already distributing this singlet-like design commercially to Australian sporting goods stores, where it was described thus: &quot;Made from heavy sheet rubber, the Sealskin suit is most effective when worn over a football jersey. When jersey becomes wet, rubber holds it firmly against body and thus warmth is generated. Water circulation automatically stops and body warmth builds up in moisture-laden jersey. The Seaskin suit provides both underwater insulation and above-water wind protection&quot;.

===Development of suit design===

Initially, wetsuits were crafted solely from foam-rubber or neoprene sheets devoid of any supporting material. Such suits demanded cautious handling during wear due to the inherent fragility and stickiness of foam-rubber against the skin. Excessive stretching and pulling often resulted in tearing these suits apart. To mitigate this issue, divers resorted to generously applying talc powder to both the suit and their body to facilitate smoother sliding of the rubber material.

Backing materials first arrived in the form of nylon knit cloth applied to one side of the neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the nylon took most of the stress of pulling on the suit, and there was less friction between the nylon and skin, but the suit still had the bare foam exposed on the outside and the nylon was relatively stiff, limiting flexibility. A small strip of neoprene reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles.

In 1960, the British Dunlop Sports Company brought out its yellow Aquafort neoprene wetsuit, whose high visibility was intended to improve diver safety. However, the line was discontinued after a short while and wetsuits reverted to their black uniformity. The colorful wetsuits seen more recently first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed. In this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers, greatly increasing the tear-resistance. An external layer also meant that decorative colors, logos, and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes. This change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits.

===Improvements in suit assembly===

The first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together. In a rubber wetsuit, this does not work well for a number of reasons, the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit. The second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn. This meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit. And although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together, it could also act as a perforated tear edge, making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off.

When nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved, but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams.

====Seam taping====
To deal with all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid waterproof rubber backing. The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a chemical solvent or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene.

With this technology, the suit could be sewn and then taped, and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes.

When colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing, taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide, jagged, black, and ugly, and was hidden within the suit and out of sight.

Many 1960s and 1970s wetsuits were black with visible yellow seam taping. The yellow made the divers more easily seen in dark low-visibility water. To prevent needle holes from leaking, O&#x27;Neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape. Applied over the interior of the glued &amp; sewn seam, then anneal bonded with a hand held teflon heating iron produced a seam that was both securely sealed and much stronger.

====Seam gluing====
Another alternative to sewing was to glue the edges of the suit together. This created a smooth, flat surface that did not necessarily need taping, but, raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing.

Most early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand, which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting. If the cut edges did not align correctly or the gluing was not done well, there might still be water leakage along the seam.

Initially, suits could be found as being sewn only, glued only, taped only, then also sewn and taped, or glued and taped, or perhaps all three.

====Blindstitching====
Sometime after nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the blind stitch method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene. This is similar to the overlock stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.

The curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. Blindstitch seams also lay flat, butting up the edge of one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other stitching methods now used mainly for decorative or stylistic purposes.

===Further advances in suit design===
Highly elastic fabrics such as spandex (also known as lycra) have mostly replaced plain nylon backing, since the nylon knit fabric cannot be stretched as much as when elasticised with lycra fibres. Incorporating lycra into the backing permits a larger amount of stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to be stretched more to fit while remaining acceptably comfortable, making the tailoring less critical.

After the development of double-backed neoprene, singled-backed neoprene still has its uses. A narrow edge strip of smooth surfaced single-backed neoprene wrapped around the leg, neck, and wrist openings of the suit creates a more effective seal against the skin than the knit fabric backing, that reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit at these places as the person moves. Since the strip is narrow, it does not drag on the skin of the wearer much and the lining makes the suit easy to put on and remove. The strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin and slightly greater contact pressure. This type of seal can also be used on neoprene dry suits as it is sufficiently watertight when properly designed. 

In the early 1970s Gul Wetsuits pioneered the one-piece wetsuit named the &#x27;steamer&#x27; because of the visible condensed water vapour given off from the suit when taken off, allowing heat and water held inside to escape. One-piece wetsuits are still sometimes referred to as &#x27;steamers&#x27;.

As wetsuit manufacturers continued to develop suit designs, they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized. The O&#x27;Neill &quot;Animal Skin&quot; created in 1974 by then Director of Marketing, E.J. Armstrong, was one of the first designs combining a turtle-neck based on the popular Sealsuit with a flexible lightweight YKK horizontal zipper across the back shoulders similar in concept to the inflatable watertight Supersuit (developed by Jack O&#x27;Neill in the late 1960s). The &quot;Animal Skin&quot; eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting (a technique E.J. Armstrong developed for application of the moulded raised rubber Supersuit logo to replace the standard flat decals). This has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear, and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber. Additionally, the &quot;Animal Skin&#x27;s&quot; looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions.

More recently, manufacturers have experimented by combining various materials with neoprene for additional warmth or flexibility of their suits. These include, but are not limited to, spandex, and wool.

Companies, such as Patagonia, have been recycling the material made from older worn wetsuits and remodeling them into a low-carbon wetsuit.

Precision computer-controlled cutting and assembly methods, such as water-jet cutting, have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision, permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and misaligned sewing. Further innovations in CAD (Computer Aided Design) technology allow precision cutting for custom-fit wetsuits.

===Return of single-backed neoprene===
As wetsuits continued to evolve, their use was explored in other sports such as open-water swimming and triathlons. Although double-backed neoprene is strong, the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of drag in the water, slowing down the swimmer. A single-backed suit has a smoother exterior surface which causes less drag. With the advances of elastic Lycra backings and blindstitching, single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s. Other developments in single-backed wetsuits include the suits designed for free-diving and spearfishing. Single lined neoprene is more flexible than double lined. To achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit, they are unlined inside, and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit. The lined outer surface may be printed with camouflage patterns for spearfishing and is more resistant to damage while in use.

Some triathlon wetsuits go further, and use rubber-molding and texturing methods to roughen up the surface of the suit on the forearms, to increase drag and help pull the swimmer forwards through the water. Extremely thin 1 mm neoprene is also often used in the under-arm area, to decrease stretch resistance and reduce strain on the swimmer when they extend their arms out over their head.

Wetsuits used for caving are often single-backed with a textured surface known as &quot;sharkskin&quot; which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded. This makes it more abrasion resistant for squeezing between rocks and doesn&#x27;t get torn in the way that fabric does.

Another reason to eliminate the external textile backing is to reduce water retention which can increase evaporative cooling and wind chill in suits used mainly out of the water.

==Types==
===Configurations===
Various configurations of wetsuit are available, with varied amounts of body coverage. Most can be worn alone or in combinations to suit the conditions:
* A sleeveless vest, covering only the torso, provides minimal coverage. Some include an attached hood. These are not usually intended to be worn alone, but as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit.
* A hooded tunic, covering the torso and head, with short legs and either short or no sleeves, is generally intended to be worn over a full suit, and has a zip closure. It may be fitted with pockets for transporting accessories.
* A jacket covers the torso and arms, with little to no coverage for the legs. Some jackets have short legs like a shorty, others feature leg holes similar to a woman&#x27;s swimsuit. A third style, the beavertail or bodysuit, has a flap which passes through the crotch and attaches at the front with clips, toggles or velcro fasteners. It is worn with (over) or without a long john or trousers. A jacket may include an integral hood, and may have a full or partial front zipper.
* A spring suit covers the torso and has short or long sleeves and short legs.
* Trousers cover the lower torso and legs.
* A short john, shorty covers the torso and legs to the knee only; does not have sleeves and is a short legged version of the long john.
* A long john, johnny, johnny suit, or farmer john/jane (depending on the gender the suit is designed for) covers the torso and legs only; it resembles a bib overall, hence the nickname.
* A full suit or steamer covers the torso and the full length of the arms and legs. Some versions come with sleeves the length of a standard t-shirt and known as a short-sleeved steamer.

Some suits are arranged in two parts; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions. Typically, two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14 mm combined thickness of neoprene over the torso and 5 to 7 mm single thickness over the limbs.

===Thickness===
Wetsuits are available in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which they are intended. The neoprene foam is available in thicknesses up to 10 mm, though 7 mm and less are most common. The thicker the suit, the warmer it will keep the wearer, but the more it will restrict movement. Because wetsuits offer significant protection from jellyfish, coral, sunburn and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (sometimes called a &quot;bodysuit&quot; or dive skins) even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments. A thick suit will restrict mobility, and as the thickness is increased the suit may become impractical, depending on the application. This is one reason why dry suits may be preferable for some applications. A wetsuit is normally specified in terms of its and style. For instance, a wetsuit with a torso thickness of 5 mm and a limb thickness of 3 mm will be described as a &quot;5/3&quot;. With new technologies the neoprene is getting more flexible. Modern 4/3 wetsuits, for instance, may feel as flexible as a 3/2 of only a few years ago. Some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back. Improved flexibility may come at the cost of greater compressibility, which reduces insulation at depth, but this is only important for diving.

===Surface finish===
Foam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell, in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene. This is necessary to prevent water absorption, and the gas bubbles do most of the insulation. Thick sheets of neoprene are foamed inside a mould, and the surfaces in contact with the mould take on the inverse texture of the mould surfaces. In the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar, but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying. The cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles, leaving what is called an open cell surface finish, but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell. The open cell finish is the most stretchy and the least tear resistant. It is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin, but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use, and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin unless lubricated.

====Wetsuit lining====
The cut surfaces are usually bonded to a synthetic knit fabric, which provides much greater tear resistance, at the expense of some loss of flexibility and stretch. This fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of composition, weave, weight and colour, and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile, thicker and stronger and less stretchy,for high wear areas, or a plush type liner to reduce water flow. Merino wool liner fabrics have also been used. Fabric lined on one side only is more flexible than double lined. After slicing the foam slab down to the required thickness, a layer of glue is applied and the chosen lining is pressed down by the lamination rollers. A more flexible lining is chosen for most applications. Neoprene foam is also available with kevlar reinforced fabric facing for high cut and abrasion resistance. This is used for reinforcing high wear areas like knee pads.

A wetsuit with a very smooth and somewhat delicate outer surface known as &quot;smoothskin&quot;, which is the original outer surface of the foamed neoprene block from which the sheets are cut, is used for long-distance swimming, triathlon, competitive apnoea, and bluewater spearfishing. These are designed to maximize the mobility of the limbs while providing both warmth and buoyancy, but the surface is delicate and easily damaged. The slick surface also dries quickly and is least affected by wind chill when out of the water.

Both smoothskin and fabric lined surfaces can be printed to produce colour patterns such as camouflage designs, which may give spearfishermen and combat divers an advantage.

===Closures===

Zippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles while remaining relatively easy to put on and remove, but they also provide leakage points for water A backing flap reduces leakage but can get caught in the zipper while closing. 
Jackets may have a full or partial front zipper, or none at all. Full body suits may have a vertical back zipper, a cross-shoulder zipper, a vertical front zipper or occasionally a cross-chest zipper. Each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages: 
*The vertical front zipper is easy to operate, but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance, and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard. It is relatively inflexible and placed over a part of the body where a lot of flexibility is desirable. The top of the closure will leak to some extent. The top end of the zip may be easily opened for comfort when the wearer is warm, but the zip may also press into the throat, which can be uncomfortable.
*Cross shoulder zipper can be made relatively watertight as it has no free ends, and is therefore used in semi-dry wetsuits. It is difficult to operate for the wearer and relatively highly stressed at the shoulders due to arm movement. The zip is also relatively vulnerable to damage from diving harnesses.
*Cross chest zipper has similar advantages to cross shoulder, but is easy for the wearer to reach and operate. The zipper is subjected to sharper bends at the shoulders than other arrangements.
*Vertical back zippers are possibly the most common arrangement as they can be operated with a lanyard. They are relatively comfortable for most applications, the suit is easy to remove, and they place the zipper directly over the spine, which though flexible in bending, does not change much in length. The top of the closure will leak to some extent.

===Sizing and fit===
Wetsuits that fit too tightly can cause difficulty breathing or even acute cardiac failure, and a loose fit allows considerable flushing which reduces effectiveness of insulation, so a proper fit is important. The quality of fit is most important for diving as this is where the thickest suits are used and the heat loss is potentially greatest. A diving wetsuit should touch the skin over as much of the body that it covers as comfortably possible, both when the wearer is relaxed and when exercising. This is difficult to achieve and the details of style and cut can affect the quality of fit. Gaps where the suit does not touch the skin will vary in volume as the diver moves and this is a major cause of flushing.

Wetsuits are made in several standard adult sizes and for children. Custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available.

=== Semi-dry suits ===

Semi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with improved seals at wrist, neck and ankles and also usually featuring a watertight zipper. Together, these features greatly reduce the amount of water moving through the suit as the wearer moves in the water. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and is not &quot;flushed&quot; out by colder water entering from the outside environment, so the wearer remains warm longer. The trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit&#x27;s insulating ability. Any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss, but this loss is minimised due to the more effective seals. Though more expensive and more difficult to take on and off than a wetsuit (in most cases, a helper will be needed to close the dry-zip, which is usually located across the shoulders), semi-dry suits are cheaper and simpler than dry suits, and in the case of scuba diving, require no additional skills to use. They are usually made from thick neoprene (typically 6 mm or more), which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the Neoprene compress at depth, like a normal wetsuit. Early suits marketed as &quot;Semi-dry&quot; suits came come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces, made of &#x27;long johns&#x27; and a separate &#x27;jacket&#x27;. Almost all modern semi-dry suits are one piece suits, with the zipper usually being across the shoulders on the back, but other arrangements have been used. Semi-dry suits do not usually incorporate boots, and most models do not include a hood, (as creating a good seal around the face is difficult) so a separate pair of wetsuit boots, hood and gloves are worn, as needed. They are most suitable for use where the water temperature is between .

===Heated suits===

Electrically heated wetsuits are also available on the market. These suits have special heating panels integrated in the back of the wetsuit. The power for heating comes from batteries also integrated into the wetsuit. More versatile is the heated neoprene vest that works in the same way as the heated wetsuit but can be worn under any type of wetsuit.

Wetsuits heated by a flow of hot water piped from the surface are standard equipment for commercial diving in cold water, particularly where the heat loss from the diver is increased by use of helium based breathing gases. Hot water suits are a loose fit as there is a constant supply of heated water piped into the suit which must escape to allow even flow distribution. Flushing with cold water is prevented by the constant outflow of heating water.

==Accessories==
Usually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet, hands or head, and the diver must wear separate neoprene boots, gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection. Other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment, and knee-pads, to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing, usually used by working divers. Suits may have abrasion protection pads in other areas depending on the application.

===Hoods===
In the thermal balance of the human body, the heat loss from the head and neck is roughly proportional to the exposed surface area, though there may be less vasoconstriction than the more peripheral areas, which could push up the amount. When the rest of the body is insulated, the percentage can be considerably higher, so wearing a well-fitting hood is useful, even at fairly moderate water temperatures. Hoods have been reported to cause claustrophobia in a minority of users, sometimes due to poor fit. The hood should not fit too tightly round the neck. Flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit, or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts. This can be achieved by tucking a circular flap at the base of the neck of the hood under the top of the suit before closing the zip, or by having a high neck on the suit.
Wearing a hood can protect the ears, and reduce and delay the onset of surfer&#x27;s ear.

===Boots===

Wetsuit boots (bootees) are worn for various purposes, and may be worn with or without a wetsuit.

====Thermal protection====
In many water sports such as scuba diving, surfing, kayaking, windsurfing, sailing and even fishing, bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would. Insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate; it may be above or below the standard of 5–6 mm of neoprene. In warmer climates where the thermal qualities of the bootee are not so important, a bootee with a thickness of 2–3.5 mm is common. The leg of the bootee may have a zipper down one side or may be tightened with a velcro strap. Where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining, to help hold the zip closed, and to keep foreign objects out.

====Foot protection====
A bootee usually has a reinforced sole for walking. Typically, this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible. The reinforced sole provides the wearer with some protection and grip when walking across shingle, coral and other rough surfaces.

=====For scuba diving=====
For scuba diving the sole of the bootee should not be so thick that the diver cannot get a fin on over it. Divers wearing bootees use fins with a foot pocket larger than needed with bare feet. Divers in warm water who do not wear a diving suit sometimes wear bootees so they can wear bigger fins. Diving bootees are typically intended for wear with open-heeled fins, held on by a strap, and usually do not fit into full-footed fins. Neoprene socks may be used with full-footed fins, either to prevent chafing and blisters, or for warmth.. Suit compression with depth also affects fin fit, as thicker neoprene compresses more with depth, and needs more stretch from the fin strap to compensate.

=====For surfing=====
For surfing, windsurfing, kitesurfing and similar sports, bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet. The bootee should not restrict the ability of a surfer to grip the board with the toes in the desired manner. Split-toe bootees allow for some improvement in this functionality. Reef walkers are small bootees that are only as high as the ankle and generally only 2 to 3.5mm thick. They are designed to allow surfers to get out to waves that break at coral reefs or at rocky beaches.

=====For kayaking=====
Several styles of wetsuit boots are commonly used for kayaking. Short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a drysuit where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks.

===Gloves===

Wetsuit gloves are worn to keep the hands warm and to protect the skin while working. They are available in a range of thicknesses. Thicker gloves reduce manual dexterity and limit feel. Wetsuit gloves are also commonly worn with dry suits. Some divers cut the fingertips of the gloves off on the fingers most used for delicate work like operating the controls on a camera housing. If this is done, the fingertips are exposed to cold and possible injury, so thin work-gloves may be worn under the insulating gloves.

For cold water use, thicker mittens with a single space for the middle, ring and fifth fingers are available and can provide more warmth at the cost of reducing dexterity.

<text>Brinsley Schwarz were a 1970s English pub rock band, named after their guitarist Brinsley Schwarz. With Nick Lowe on bass and vocals, keyboardist Bob Andrews and drummer Billy Rankin, the band evolved from the 1960s pop band Kippington Lodge. They were later augmented by Ian Gomm on guitar and vocals.

==Formation==
Brinsley Schwarz (guitar, piano, vocals) originally met Nick Lowe at Woodbridge School where they played in school bands with Barry Landeman (keyboards, vocals) and Phil Hall (guitar). In 1964, whilst still at school, they toured RAF bases in Germany as &quot;Sounds 4+1&quot;. On leaving school, Schwarz formed &quot;Three&#x27;s A Crowd&quot; with Pete Whale (drums) and Dave Cottam (bass). Landeman joined in 1967 and they renamed themselves &quot;Kippington Lodge&quot;. Their first two singles, produced by Mark Wirtz, in a close-harmony pop style, both flopped. Cottam left, and Schwarz invited Lowe to join. Landeman then left to join Vanity Fare, Bob Andrews joined on keyboards, and finally, Whale was replaced by Billy Rankin on drums. Although the next three singles also failed, they had a residency as support band at The Marquee. The band&#x27;s style was changing from pop into &quot;a folk-rock band with psychedelic pretentions&quot;. In 1969 they renamed the band after their guitarist, and performed their new music under this name, whilst continuing to play pop as Kippington Lodge. One of the band&#x27;s first managers, John Schofield, was at the time the lover of Hattie Jacques (who would occasionally make bacon sandwiches for the band members when they visited Schofield&#x27;s home). In the early part of their career the band shared a communal home in a large old house in Beaconsfield and these premises were used as a rehearsal space by The Band, who came to the UK as part of the Warner Brothers tour. The Band borrowed Brinsley Schwarz&#x27;s instruments to rehearse.

== Publicity campaign==
Brinsley Schwarz signed a contract with manager Dave Robinson, of Famepushers, who devised a plan to earn the band extensive publicity. They were to open for Van Morrison and Quicksilver Messenger Service at the Fillmore East in New York City, on 3 and 4 April 1970. Robinson would fly a plane full of British journalists to the show, so they could review it, along with the winners of a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; competition, arranged in order to get pre-publicity. Though the band had planned on leaving a few days early, so they could rehearse, visa problems prevented this, so they went to Canada and entered the US in a light aircraft. They arrived in New York shortly before they were due on stage, and had to use hired equipment with which they were unfamiliar. The journalists were due the following day, but their plane was delayed for four hours, so they had free use of the bar, and eventually arrived at the show either drunk or hung over. The show did not go over well, and the band received a flood of negative reviews over the following weeks, including bad reviews of their first album, &quot;Brinsley Schwarz&quot;, which was released shortly after their return to the United Kingdom. This incident became known as the &quot;Brinsley Schwarz Hype&quot;.

Casey Kasem&#x27;s version of this story, in a September 1979 episode of &quot;American Top Forty&quot;, implied that the presence of the critics was a surprise to the band.

==Pub-rock==
Later in 1970, Brinsley Schwarz released their second album, &quot;Despite It All&quot;, which had a definite country sound to it. They were heavily influenced by Eggs over Easy, who they first saw perform at &#x27;The Tally Ho&#x27; in Kentish Town, and admired their laid-back style and extensive repertoire. In 1971, guitarist Ian Gomm joined the band, and they recorded their third album &quot;Silver Pistol&quot;. In response to &quot;the hype&quot;, they became anti-commercial and spent much of 1971 rehearsing, although they toured on the &#x27;Downhome Rhythm Kings&#x27; package with Help Yourself and Ernie Graham (ex Eire Apparent), who were all managed by Dave Robinson. This led to them backing Ernie Graham on his eponymous solo album.

Brinsley Schwarz played at the second Glastonbury Festival (1971), and one track, &quot;Love Song&quot;, appeared on the subsequent &quot;Glastonbury Fayre&quot; album. Their solid live performances soon garnered the band a large fanbase in London, and, along with bands like Eggs over Easy, Brinsley Schwarz were soon dubbed &quot;pub rock&quot; by rock journalists. They sounded rather like The Band, with Schwarz&#x27;s guitar work influenced greatly by Robbie Robertson&#x27;s. In February 1972, they supported Hawkwind and Man at the Greasy Truckers Party, which was issued as a double album, and brought critical acclaim. Unfortunately, for a band known for its live performances, this was their only live album.

1972&#x27;s ironic take on country-rock, &quot;Nervous on the Road&quot;, also received excellent reviews. It did not reach the charts, but earned them a slot opening for Paul McCartney&#x27;s Wings 1973 UK Tour. The same year, they also acted as Frankie Miller&#x27;s band for his debut album &quot;Once in a Blue Moon&quot;. Their fifth studio album &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Ever Change&quot;, issued in 1973, was less well received by the critics, and achieved poor sales. However during this time they made successful appearances on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; with Lowe on guitar and vocals, Gomm on bass and Schwarz on piano alongside Andrews on keyboard and recorded sessions for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show. In 1974, they arranged for Dave Edmunds to produce their sixth album &quot;The New Favourites of... Brinsley Schwarz&quot;, which was more polished, and again received good reviews. This association also led to their touring as Dave Edmunds&#x27; backing band, appearing on the live tracks of his &quot;Subtle as a Flying Mallet&quot; album. In addition to the albums, Brinsley Schwarz also issued a series of singles under their own name, and various pseudonyms, such as &quot;The Hitters&quot;, &quot;The Knees&quot;, &quot;Limelight&quot; and &quot;The Brinsleys&quot; but these all failed. They recorded a final album, &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot;, in 1974 but this was not released at the time. They finally disbanded in March 1975.

==Subsequent careers==
Brinsley Schwarz and Bob Andrews joined Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour, which functioned as a unit through 1981. Later Andrews moved to New Orleans. Schwarz, meanwhile, continued playing as a sideman for various artists through the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Schwarz joined a reunited Ducks Deluxe in 2009, then both Schwarz and Andrews joined a reunited Rumour in 2012.

Billy Rankin joined Terraplane and then Big Jim Sullivan&#x27;s Tiger. He retired from the music industry in 1977, though he was persuaded to play with a reunited Ducks Deluxe for their 30th anniversary reunion show in 2007.

Nick Lowe and Ian Gomm both began solo careers, achieving moderate mainstream success. Lowe&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Jesus of Cool&quot; received considerable critical acclaim and reached number 22 in the UK Albums Chart. It included the track &quot;I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass&quot;, which reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The album also included Bob Andrews on keyboard and Dave Edmunds on guitar. Lowe also co-wrote Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s top ten hit &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;, which reached number 9 in 1979. Lowe&#x27;s 1979 single and biggest worldwide hit &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; was co-written with Gomm and originally recorded by Brinsley Schwarz for their unreleased final album. This version was included on the 2008 30th anniversary edition of the &quot;Jesus of Cool&quot; album. In 1979, Gomm had a hit with &quot;Hold On&quot;, which reached number 18 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

The original version of &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, which was written by Lowe and was later covered by Elvis Costello, was released by the band in 1974 on their album &quot;The New Favourites of... Brinsley Schwarz&quot;. Costello knew of the song as both a fan and part-time roadie for the band, which is where he and Lowe first met. Another rendition was featured on the multi-million-selling film soundtrack &quot;The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album&quot;, performed by Curtis Stigers. Bill Murray&#x27;s character sang the song at a party in Sofia Coppola&#x27;s film &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot;

<text>Photomultiplier tubes (photomultipliers or PMTs for short) are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are members of the class of vacuum tubes, more specifically vacuum phototubes. These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times or 108 (i.e., 160 dB), in multiple dynode stages, enabling (for example) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is low.
The combination of high gain, low noise, high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in low light level spectroscopy, confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, nuclear and particle physics, astronomy, medical diagnostics including blood tests, medical imaging, motion picture film scanning (telecine), radar jamming, and high-end image scanners known as drum scanners. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, are the basis of night vision devices. Research that analyzes light scattering, such as the study of polymers in solution, often uses a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.

Semiconductor devices, particularly silicon photomultipliers and avalanche photodiodes, are alternatives to classical photomultipliers; however, photomultipliers are uniquely well-suited for applications requiring low-noise, high-sensitivity detection of light that is imperfectly collimated.

==Structure and operating principles==

Photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing (using an extremely tight and durable glass-to-metal seal like other vacuum tubes), containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, which is usually a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device. Electrons are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are directed by the focusing electrode toward the electron multiplier, where electrons are multiplied by the process of secondary emission.
The electron multiplier consists of a number of electrodes called &quot;dynodes&quot;. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3 eV for &quot;blue&quot; photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100 eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.

The necessary distribution of voltage along the series of dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage on the order of 1000 V, while the anode is very close to ground potential. The capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube. Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative.

There are two common photomultiplier orientations, the &quot;head-on&quot; or &quot;end-on&quot; (transmission mode) design, as shown above, where light enters the flat, circular top of the tube and passes the photocathode, and the &quot;side-on&quot; design (reflection mode), where light enters at a particular spot on the side of the tube, and impacts on an opaque photocathode. The side-on design is used, for instance, in the type 931, the first mass-produced PMT. Besides the different photocathode materials, performance is also affected by the transmission of the window material that the light passes through, and by the arrangement of the dynodes. Many photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these, and other, design variables. The manufacturers manuals provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application.

==History==
The invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the photoelectric effect and of secondary emission.

===Photoelectric effect===

The first demonstration of the photoelectric effect was carried out in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz using ultraviolet light. Significant for practical applications, Elster and Geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using &quot;visible&quot; light striking alkali metals (potassium and sodium). The addition of caesium, another alkali metal, has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum.

Historically, the photoelectric effect is associated with Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905, an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. It is worthwhile to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of &quot;quanta&quot;, for the first time.

===Secondary emission===

The phenomenon of secondary emission (the ability of electrons in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked photosensitivity). In 1899 the effect was first reported by Villard. In 1902, Austin and Starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams emitted a larger number of electrons than were incident. The application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after World War I by Westinghouse scientist Joseph Slepian in a 1919 patent.

====The race towards a practical electronic television camera====

The ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was the need for a practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical video camera (the iconoscope). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the orthicon, to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of photoemission (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with secondary emission, both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.

====First photomultiplier, single-stage (early 1934)====

The first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ. Harley Iams and Bernard Salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain. These accomplishments were finalized &quot;prior&quot; to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers (Proc. IRE). The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical photocathode, a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10 kHz.

====Magnetic photomultipliers (mid 1934–1937)====

Higher gains were sought than those available from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity dynodes). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons&#x27; trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above). Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultipliers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages.

In the USSR, RCA-manufactured radio equipment was introduced on a large scale by Joseph Stalin to construct broadcast networks, and the newly formed All-Union Scientific Research Institute for Television was gearing up a research program in vacuum tubes that was advanced for its time and place. Numerous visits were made by RCA scientific personnel to the USSR in the 1930s, prior to the Cold War, to instruct the Soviet customers on the capabilities of RCA equipment and to investigate customer needs. During one of these visits, in September 1934, RCA&#x27;s Vladimir Zworykin was shown the first multiple-dynode photomultiplier, or &quot;photoelectron multiplier&quot;. This pioneering device was proposed by Leonid A. Kubetsky in 1930 which he subsequently built in 1934. The device achieved gains of 1000x or more when demonstrated in June 1934. The work was submitted for print publication only two years later, in July 1936 as emphasized in a recent 2006 publication of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS), which terms it &quot;Kubetsky&#x27;s Tube.&quot; The Soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the Ag-O-Cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by General Electric in the 1920s.

By October 1935, Vladimir Zworykin, George Ashmun Morton, and Louis Malter of RCA in Camden, NJ submitted their manuscript describing the first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple dynode tube — the device later called a &quot;photomultiplier&quot; — to Proc. IRE. The RCA prototype photomultipliers also used an Ag-O-Cs (silver oxide-caesium) photocathode. They exhibited a peak quantum efficiency of 0.4% at 800 nm.

====Electrostatic photomultipliers (1937–present)====

Whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle, electrostatic photomultipliers (with no magnetic field) were demonstrated by Jan Rajchman of RCA Laboratories in Princeton, NJ in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers. The first mass-produced photomultiplier, the Type 931, was of this design and is still commercially produced today.

====Improved photocathodes====

Also in 1936, a much improved photocathode, Cs3Sb (caesium-antimony), was reported by P. Görlich. The caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12% at 400 nm, and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by RCA (i.e., the 931-type) both as a photocathode and as a secondary-emitting material for the dynodes. Different photocathodes provided differing spectral responses.

===Spectral response of photocathodes===
In the early 1940s, the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), an industry committee on standardization, developed a system of designating spectral responses. The philosophy included the idea that the product&#x27;s user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated. Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned &quot;S-numbers&quot; (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today. For example, S-11 uses the caesium-antimony photocathode with a lime glass window, S-13 uses the same photocathode with a fused silica window, and S-25 uses a so-called &quot;multialkali&quot; photocathode (Na-K-Sb-Cs, or sodium-potassium-antimony-caesium) that provides extended response in the red portion of the visible light spectrum. No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.

===RCA Corporation===
For decades, RCA was responsible for performing the most important work in developing and refining photomultipliers. RCA was also largely responsible for the commercialization of photomultipliers. The company compiled and published an authoritative and widely used &quot;Photomultiplier Handbook&quot;. RCA provided printed copies free upon request. The handbook, which continues to be made available online at no cost by the successors to RCA, is considered to be an essential reference.

Following a corporate break-up in the late 1980s involving the acquisition of RCA by General Electric and disposition of the divisions of RCA to numerous third parties, RCA&#x27;s photomultiplier business became an independent company.

===Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility===
The Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility was opened by the U.S. Navy in 1942 and operated by RCA for the manufacture of radio and microwave tubes. Following World War II, the naval facility was acquired by RCA. &quot;RCA Lancaster,&quot; as it became known, was the base for the development and the production of commercial television products. In subsequent years other products were added, such as cathode-ray tubes, photomultiplier tubes, motion-sensing light control switches, and closed-circuit television systems.

===Burle Industries===
Burle Industries, as a successor to the RCA Corporation, carried the RCA photomultiplier business forward after 1986, based in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility. The 1986 acquisition of RCA by General Electric resulted in the divestiture of the RCA Lancaster New Products Division. Hence, 45 years after being founded by the U.S. Navy, its management team, led by Erich Burlefinger, purchased the division and in 1987 founded Burle Industries.

In 2005, after eighteen years as an independent enterprise, Burle Industries and a key subsidiary were acquired by Photonis, a European holding company Photonis Group. Following the acquisition, Photonis was composed of Photonis Netherlands, Photonis France, Photonis USA, and Burle Industries. Photonis USA operates the former Galileo Corporation Scientific Detector Products Group (Sturbridge, Massachusetts), which had been purchased by Burle Industries in 1999. The group is known for microchannel plate detector (MCP) electron multipliers—an integrated micro-vacuum tube version of photomultipliers. MCPs are used for imaging and scientific applications, including night vision devices.

On 9 March 2009, Photonis announced that it would cease all production of photomultipliers at both the Lancaster, Pennsylvania and the Brive, France plants.

===Hamamatsu===
The Japan-based company Hamamatsu Photonics (also known as Hamamatsu) has emerged since the 1950s as a leader in the photomultiplier industry. Hamamatsu, in the tradition of RCA, has published its own handbook, which is available without cost on the company&#x27;s website. Hamamatsu uses different designations for particular photocathode formulations and introduces modifications to these designations based on Hamamatsu&#x27;s proprietary research and development.

===Photocathode materials===
The photocathodes can be made of a variety of materials, with different properties. Typically the materials have low work function and are therefore prone to thermionic emission, causing noise and dark current, especially the materials sensitive in infrared; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise. The most common photocathode materials are Ag-O-Cs (also called S1) transmission-mode, sensitive from 300–1200 nm. High dark current; used mainly in near-infrared, with the photocathode cooled; GaAs:Cs, caesium-activated gallium arsenide, flat response from 300 to 850 nm, fading towards ultraviolet and to 930 nm; InGaAs:Cs, caesium-activated indium gallium arsenide, higher infrared sensitivity than GaAs:Cs, between 900–1000 nm much higher signal-to-noise ratio than Ag-O-Cs; Sb-Cs, (also called S11) caesium-activated antimony, used for reflective mode photocathodes; response range from ultraviolet to visible, widely used; bialkali (Sb-K-Cs, Sb-Rb-Cs), caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony-potassium alloy, similar to Sb:Cs, with higher sensitivity and lower noise. can be used for transmission-mode; favorable response to a NaI:Tl scintillator flashes makes them widely used in gamma spectroscopy and radiation detection; high-temperature bialkali (Na-K-Sb), can operate up to 175 °C, used in well logging, low dark current at room temperature; multialkali (Na-K-Sb-Cs), (also called S20), wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared, special cathode processing can extend range to 930 nm, used in broadband spectrophotometers; solar-blind (Cs-Te, Cs-I), sensitive to vacuum-UV and ultraviolet, insensitive to visible light and infrared (Cs-Te has cutoff at 320 nm, Cs-I at 200 nm).

===Window materials===
The windows of the photomultipliers act as wavelength filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths. Borosilicate glass is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300 nm. High borate borosilicate glasses exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm. Glass with very low content of potassium can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the potassium-40 isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185 nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic silica transmits down to 160 nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than kovar (and than borosilicate glass that&#x27;s expansion-matched to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window and the rest of the tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. Magnesium fluoride transmits ultraviolet down to 115 nm. Hygroscopic, though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.

==Usage considerations==
Photomultiplier tubes typically utilize 1000 to 2000 volts to accelerate electrons within the chain of dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage is connected to the cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted &quot;dark current&quot; pulses that may affect the operation. Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system.

While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be shielded from ambient light to prevent their destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, so that when the measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.

If used in a location with strong magnetic fields, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated because of the high voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.

==Applications==
Photomultipliers were the first electric eye devices, being used to measure interruptions in beams of light. Photomultipliers are used in conjunction with scintillators to detect Ionizing radiation by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments, and particle radiation in physics experiments. Photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as compound semiconductors and quantum dots. Photomultipliers are used as the detector in many spectrophotometers. This allows an instrument design that escapes the thermal noise limit on sensitivity, and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument.

Photomultipliers are used in numerous medical equipment designs. For example, blood analysis devices used by clinical medical laboratories, such as flow cytometers, utilize photomultipliers to determine the relative concentration of various components in blood samples, in combination with optical filters and incandescent lamps. An array of photomultipliers is used in a gamma camera. Photomultipliers are typically used as the detectors in flying-spot scanners.

===High-sensitivity applications===
After 50 years, during which solid-state electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains a unique and important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect current source, owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no Johnson noise associated with photomultiplier signal currents, even though they are greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 100 dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains shot noise.

Photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be electronically amplified by a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier (in the signal path subsequent to the photomultiplier), thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes. Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations. The aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that, while small, nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons.

For smaller photon fluxes, the photomultiplier can be operated in photon-counting, or Geiger, mode (see also Single-photon avalanche diode). In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit. However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the &quot;dead time&quot; associated with a first photon and never be noticed.

A photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons; this is called the &quot;dark current&quot;. Photon-counting applications generally demand photomultipliers designed to minimise dark current.

Nonetheless, the ability to detect single photons striking the primary photosensitive surface itself reveals the quantization principle that Einstein put forth. Photon counting (as it is called) reveals that light, not only being a wave, consists of discrete particles (i.e., photons).

=== Temperature range ===
It is known that at cryogenic temperatures photo multipliers demonstrate increase in (bursting) electrons emission as temperature lowers. This phenomenon is still unexplained by any physics theory.

<text>The Eternal Champion is a fictional character created by British author Michael Moorcock and is a recurrent feature in many of his speculative fiction works.

==General overview==
Many of Moorcock&#x27;s novels and short stories take place in a shared Multiverse: an array of interconnected parallel universes, many-layered dimensions, spheres, and alternative worlds, spanning from the Big Bang to the End of Time and from planet Earth to faraway galaxies. All these regions of spaces and parallel timelines are given shape by two metaphysical forces which are perpetually opposed to each other: Law and Chaos, which represent perpetual stasis and ever-changing disorder. Since a clear-cut prevalence of either Law or Chaos would erase all life from the Multiverse, a third force known as the Cosmic Balance enforces certain limits on the powers of Law and Chaos, which in turn ensure the continued existence of the Multiverse. Law, Chaos, and the Balance are implied to be non-sentient, but they do manifest through god-like beings who express one facet or another of the three cosmic principles, and in turn, these deities can empower mortal creatures as their heralds and representatives.

The Eternal Champion is an appointed paladin of Balance who is bound to exist in each and every world and age of the Multiverse, so that Law and Chaos are perpetually kept in check; however, he often does not know of his role or struggles against it, never to succeed. Since he must intervene whenever either Law or Chaos has gained an excess of power, requiring him to tip the scales accordingly, he is always doomed to be surrounded by strife and destruction, although he may go through long periods of relative quiet.

All the different Eternal Champions are implied to be different facets or &quot;incarnations&quot; of one semi-conscious being (a platonic archetype of a sort): most of them are peerless fighters and generals and have an unbreakable bond with a sentient Chaos-aligned weapon, the Black Sword, which, in turn, takes on a different form for each Champion. Likewise, many Champions are aided by an Eternal Companion and an Eternal Consort: a sidekick and a love interest who are themselves aspects of two semi-divine figures. This recursivity through the Multiverse is further underlined by the number of Champions, Companions, and mentor-figures to the Champions Moorcock has given the &quot;J&quot; and &quot;C&quot; initials, as a form of naming &quot;fil rouge&quot;; in the same vein, many Champions and Companions belong to one branch or another of the extensive von Bek dynasty.

Space- and time-travels through the Multiverse are in fact possible, to the point that one humanoid species called the Eldrens is spread among many different worlds and ages and interacts with many different Champions; however, cosmic laws establish that no two Eternal Champions can coexist in the same situation, or the very fabric of reality would be severely damaged. The only exceptions are cataclysmic events such as the end of a Cycle of Cycles of the Multiverse&#x27;s progression, or an invasion by hostile entities from an entirely separate multiverse: in these cases, different incarnations of the Champion may join forces to thwart the impending threat, possibly by temporarily merging their individual bodies into a true demigod of immense power.

==Incarnations==
The following list presents all known Champions in alphabetical order, mentions their respective Swords, Companions, and Consorts, and briefly summarizes their individual plotlines and publishing history:
* Alerik
* Alivale
* Konrad Arflane: the hero of the postapocalyptic novel &quot;The Ice Schooner&quot; (1969), Arflane lives during a new ice age that has engulfed most of Earth and forced the surviving humans to revert to a hunting-gathering economy; he sets sails on the eponymous ice schooner to reach the fabled settlement of New York and scavenge all ancestral knowledge that could help restore human civilization.
* Artos the Celt
* Asquiol of Pompeii: the main character of the science-fiction novella &quot;The Blood Red Game&quot; (1963), Asquiol is leading a human colonizing force into a parallel universe and has to fight for supremacy against a hostile native species. &quot;The Blood Red Game&quot; was eventually combined with the earlier novella &quot;The Sundered Worlds&quot; (1962) into the full-length novel &quot;The Sundered Worlds&quot; (1965), making Asquiol somehow of a guest character into the Von Bek saga.
* Aubec, Earl of Malador: Aubec debuted in a 1964 short story titled either &quot;The Dream of Earl Aubec&quot; or &quot;Master of Chaos&quot; depending on the collection: he lives in the same world as Elric of Melniboné many generations before that character&#x27;s birth, serves as a national champion of the human kingdom of Lormyria and is the paramour of the Lormyrian monarch, Queen Eloarde. Moorcock planned a whole series about Aubec&#x27;s wars against Melniboné in order to ensure human independence, eventually reconnecting to Elric&#x27;s saga as a direct prequel, but the project was eventually aborted; consequently, &quot;The Dream of Earl Aubec&quot; was reincorporated into Elric&#x27;s series as a prologue.
* Captain Oswald Bastable: the main character and narrator of the &quot;Nomad of Time&quot; trilogy (1971–1981), Captain Bastable is an officer of the British Imperial Army stationed in the Raj in the early 20th century, until a series of time-travel incidents transports him into three different uchronias: a 1973 where the World Wars have not been fought and the British Empire is now encroached by decolonizing movements; a 1904 where Europe has been left in tatters by a precocious and even more devastating Great War; a 1941 where the British and German Empires are firmly allied. Bastable&#x27;s misadventures in these alternative timelines are constructed as a biography and literary historians regard them as the prototypes of the steampunk subgenre.
* Brian
* Jherek Carnelian: one of the last humans to be alive on Earth as the Multiverse is nearing the End of Time, Carnelian is a creature of semi-divine power, hedonistic interests, and obnoxious morality (not unlike his fellow End-Timers), but his lifestyle changes forever once he falls in love with Mrs. Amelia Underwood, a time traveler from the Nineteenth Century; the couple&#x27;s courtship, relationship and shared adventures across time and space are the subject of a trilogy called &quot;The Dancers at the End of Time&quot; (1972–1976); this series is complemented by the &quot;Legends at the End of Time&quot;: five semi-autonomous short stories and novelettes taking place at the End of Time, themselves composed in the late Seventies (with an additional sixth one being published in 2008). This series is characterized by a high number of cameos from other leading and supporting characters of the Eternal Champion mythos.
* Jerry Cornelius: an adventurer and dimensional traveler Moorcock created in the mid-1960s and developed for the following forty years, resulting in an early tetralogy of novels, &quot;The Cornelius Quartet&quot; (1968–1977), a ponderous collection of short fiction, &quot;The Lives and Times of Jerry Cornelius&quot; (1976), and a later hexalogy of novels, &quot;The Cornelius Calendar&quot; (composed in two stages, 1976–1981 and 2002–2008), with more tales in the working. Cornelius&#x27; saga consists of a wide array of surreal situations kept together by the character&#x27;s uniquely fluid identity and it represents an influential form of experimental literature in the wider context of psychedelic counterculture. This series also includes two spin-off works, a Doctor Who licensed novel titled &quot;The Coming of the Terraphiles&quot; (2010), whose Captain Cornelius is, in fact, Jerry&#x27;s incarnation in the Whoniverse; and &quot;The Distant Suns&quot; (1975), a late example of pulp space opera Moorcock co-authored with James Cawthorn, depicting Jerry as an air force Colonel and a space explorer. Moreover, it is implied that Lord Jagged of Canaria from Jherek Carnelian&#x27;s series, Jaspar Colinadous from one of Elric&#x27;s adventures, Dorian Hawkmoon&#x27;s Jehamia Cohnahlias, Corum&#x27;s Jhary-a-Conel, and John Daker&#x27;s Jermays the Crooked are Jerry&#x27;s counterparts in their respective dimensions. Jerry&#x27;s version of the Black Sword is a Needle Gun (later morphed into a Vibragun), his Consort is his own sister Catherine (depicted as his wife in &quot;The Distant Suns&quot;, to avoid any incestuous undertones), and he has a conflictual bond with fellow dimensional adventurer Una Persson.
* Jerry Cornell: in 1966 Moorcock edited (and in fact ghost-wrote) a sizeable section of the spy novel &quot;The LSD Dossier&quot; by Roger Harris and eventually authored two novels starring Harris&#x27;s original main character, secret agent Nick Allard; later on Moorcock revised his solo works into a stand-alone series centered upon Agent Jerry Cornell (1970–1980), an overt parody of character tropes and clichés from Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series.
* John Daker: a human implied to come from 20th-century Earth, he is forced by Balance to reincarnate into various aspects of the Champion while staying fully aware of all his identities after every transmigration. Through his own series, he takes on four different personas:
*# Lord Erekosë: a warrior from an unspecified age of Earth&#x27;s history and the only human capable of holding the radioactive sword Kunajana. At the beginning of the novella &quot;The Eternal Champion&quot; (1962; expanded into a novel of the same title in 1970) Erekosë has been dead for generations, but a necromantic ritual resurrects him as a new existence for John Daker; the reborn Erekosë consequently gets entangled into a world war between humans and Eldrens and into a love triangle between the two factions&#x27; princesses, Eldren Ermizhad and human Iolinda.
*# Count Ulrik Skarlsol: once his missions as Erekosë are resolved, Daker is forcibly transferred into Count Ulrik Skarlsol, Lord of the Frozen Keep, a hybernated hero native to an ice-bound planet. During the novel &quot;Phoenix in Obsidian&quot; (1970) Count Ulrik embarks on a quest for the mysterious &quot;Chalice&quot; (possibly a counterpart of the Holy Grail) and is forced to wield the Cold Sword, an extremely powerful and malevolent form of the Black Sword.
*# Clen of Clen-Gar: Daker assumes this identity during &quot;The Swords of Heaven, the Flowers of Hell&quot; (1979), a graphic novel co-authored by Moorcock and Howard Chaykin which bridges the time gap between the second and third prose novel. Clen is a human lord of a prosperous bucolic territory called &quot;Heaven&quot;, whose &quot;Angel&quot; denizens are responsible for the abysmal state of their neighboring land of &quot;Hell&quot;; as the two countries clash in war, Clen gets romantically involved with Lady Gradesmor from Heaven.
*# Prince Flamadin: Flamadin is the ruler of a dimension called Draachenheem and owns both the Dragon Sword (a Black Sword comparable in power to Ulrik Skarlson&#x27;s Cold Sword) and the Actoris Stone, an enchanted gem that would later become Elric of Melniboné&#x27;s family heirloom. In &quot;The Dragon in the Sword&quot; (1986) Daker as Flamadin and his companion from 20th-century Germany, Ulrich von Bek, travel across many interconnected dimensions to prevent a major cataclysm.
* Elric of Melniboné: Moorcock&#x27;s breakthrough character, Elric lives in a prehistorical age of Earth and is the sorcerer-emperor of the Melnibonéans, a pre-human species of Chaos-aligned feys (later retconned into being a branch of the Eldren); he wields the soul-eating sword Stormbringer, on which he is co-dependent due to his frail health, and spends his life trying to thwart the Chaos God Arioch, who is also his undesired personal patron due to an ancestral Melnibonéan tradition; the first and last novels in this series also feature Mournblade, Stormbringer&#x27;s twin sword, which is wielded by Elric&#x27;s kinsmen. In the early stages of his saga, Elric is enamored of his cousin Princess Cymoril and gets one-time help from Oone the Dreamthief, an enchantress, and Count Smiorgan, a well-known reaver; later on, he falls in love with the human aristocrat Zarozinia and casts his lot with Moonglum of Elwher, a sybaritic sellsword, and Rackhir the Red Archer, a powerful paladin of Balance. Elric&#x27;s series represents a major milestone in sword &amp; sorcery fiction and, unlike Moorcock&#x27;s later works, was composed anachronically: it originally consisted of seven short stories and a serialized conclusive novel written from 1961 to 1967, but it was later expanded with three additional novels in the 1970s, two in the 1990s, and some more peripheral contents during the early 21st century.
* Franik
* Professor Faustaff: the leading character in &quot;The Wrecks of Time&quot; (1965), he is a physicist fighting the space-faring marauders known as the D-Squads in order to protect a cluster of fifteen different Earths that exist in parallel to Faustaff&#x27;s own planet. The 1996 revision of &quot;The Wrecks of Time&quot; renamed Faustaff&#x27;s ally Gordon Ogg into &quot;Gordon Begg&quot;, in order to retcon him into a Von Bek and underline those character&#x27;s respective status as an Eternal Champion and Companion, but this change was eventually dropped in the 2014 reprint.
* Goldberg
* Duke Dorian Hawkmoon von Köln: a German soldier in a post-nuclear Europe where magic and ancient technology coexist, Duke Hawkmoon embarks on a quest together with his retainer Oladahn to recover the fabled Runestaff (a magical talisman akin to the Holy Grail) and protect the world from the warmongering Dark Empire of Granbretan, which is ruled by the ruthless half-human half-machine King Huon; as this enterprise progresses, Hawkmoon is forced to bear the enchanted Black Jewel, a manifestation of the Black Sword, and falls in love with Yisselda of Brass, heiress of a fiefdom in the land of Kamarg. Dorian&#x27;s war against Granbretan is central in the &quot;Runestaff&quot; tetralogy (1967–1969) while his family life with Yisselda serves as a backdrop to the &quot;Chronicles of Castle Brass&quot;/&quot;Count Brass&quot; trilogy (1973–1975), which culminates into a crossover with Elric&#x27;s, Daker&#x27;s, and Corum&#x27;s respective series.
* Ilanth
* Queen Ilian of Garathorm: one of the very few female Championesses, she teams up with Duke Hawkmoon once he travels to her own world during his sixth novel, &quot;The Champion of Garathorm&quot;.
* Karl Glogauer: a hedonist and a hippie with a countercultural background, Glogauer debuts in the novella &quot;Behold the Man&quot; (1966; expanded into a novel of the same title in 1969), in which he time-travels to Roman Palestine so that he can meet Jesus Christ; the later novel &quot;Breakfast in the Ruins&quot; (1972) details the character&#x27;s gay romances and hallucinatory experiences in contemporary London. He also cameos in Jerry Cornelius&#x27;s adventures.
* Corum Jhaelen Irsei: a prince of the Vadhagh, a Law-aligned branch of the Eldren people, Corum effectively becomes the last of his kin after a disastrous war against the Mabden, a species created by Chaos of which Homo sapiens is the Terran variant. After a period of thralldom, the mutilation of his left hand and right eye, and their replacement with magical prosthetics (hence his alias as Corum Llaw Ereint, &quot;Corum of the Silver Hand&quot;), the former prince rises in rebellion against his captors and wages a veritable crusade against Chaos, which takes place both in Corum&#x27;s own age during the &quot;Swords&quot; trilogy (1971) and in a distant future during the &quot;Silver Hand&quot; trilogy (1973–1974). As his vendetta unfolds, Corum pursues troubled romances with two human women, Rhalina and Medhbh, and is reliably backed by Jhary-a-Conel, a well-versed dimensional traveler who occasionally supports Hawkmoon as well. Notice that Corum&#x27;s name is an anagram of &quot;Jeremiah Cornelius&quot;.
* Jack Karaquazian: a leading character in the &quot;Second Ether&quot; trilogy (1995–1996), which depicts the power struggles between god-like beings (such as Karaquazian himself) of Lawful, Chaotic and neutral affiliation to take control of Balance and swing it their own respective way. Jack is involved in an entangled love affair with his Consort Colinda Dovero, his Companion Sam Oakenhurst and Sam&#x27;s other love interest Rose von Bek.
* Michael Kane of Old Mars: the hero of a 1965 trilogy of novels, Michael Kane is a human scientist from Earth transported to a fictional version of Mars, where he gets embroiled in swashbuckling adventures and court intrigues, including a romance with Martian queen Shizala. Kane is constructed as an explicit homage and throwback to the planetary romance subgenre and, more specifically, to John Carter of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs; in turn, the biographical style of the trilogy represents a direct antecedent to Oswald Bastable&#x27;s saga.
* Clovis Marca: the leading character in &quot;The Shores of Death&quot; (1966), Marca is one of the last human denizens of a future Earth which stopped rotating and is now split between a daily and a nightly hemisphere; he embarks on a quest to cure humankind&#x27;s severe sterility and grant his species a future. The 1996 revision of &quot;The Shores of Death&quot; renamed Marca into &quot;Clovis Becker&quot; in order to retcon him into a distant Von Bek, but this change was eventually dropped in the 2014 reprint.
* Mejink-La-Kos
* M&#x27;v Okom Sebpt O&#x27;Riley, Gunholder of the Qui Lors Ventures: another female Championess, she wields the Black Sword under the guise of a soul-eating pistol, the Banning Gun. She acts as a mentor to Eric Beck in &quot;Elric: The Balance Lost&quot;.
* Oshbek-Uy
* Pournachas
* Alan Powys: the leading character in &quot;The Winds of Limbo&quot; (1965), Powys is a state functionary in a distant future where humankind has retreated underground under the stewardship of a despotic government; he strives to protect his home country from a space terrorist known as &quot;The Fireclown&quot;. The 1996 revision of &quot;The Winds of Limbo&quot; renamed Powys into &quot;Alain von Bek&quot; in order to retcon him into a distant Von Bek, but this change was eventually dropped in the 2014 reprint.
* Colonel Maxim Arturovitch &quot;Pyat&quot; Pyatnitski: possibly the only Champion whose adventures are fully mimetic rather than fantastical, Colonel Pyat is a long-lived Russian aristocrat and military man born on 1 January 1900. He spends his life traveling across the globe and getting entangled into all sorts of high-level political intrigues, effectively shaping the fates of Earth before, during, and after the World Wars, his only stable human connection being his lover Honoria Cornelius, Jerry&#x27;s mother. Moorcock originally created Pyat as a supporting character in Jerry Cornelius&#x27;s series and eventually fleshed him out in the &quot;Pyat Quartet&quot; (1981–2006); this series is structured it as a self-celebratory four-volume autobiography by the Colonel himself, with Moorcock acting as an editor.
* Ryan: the lead character of &quot;The Black Corridor&quot; (1969), Ryan lives in a dystopian future of rampaging xenophobia, nuclear warfare and societal collapse; he commandeers the interstellar spaceship &quot;Hope Dempsy&quot; and tries to bring a rag-tag group of refugees to safety. 
* The &quot;Scar-Faced Brooder&quot; or &quot;Cronarch&quot;: a character from Moorcock&#x27;s juvenile novelettes &quot;The Time Dweller&quot; (1964) and &quot;Escape from Evening&quot; (1965), dealing with the state of human society in a dying Earth scenario.
* Shaleen
* Sojan the Swordsman: Moorcock&#x27;s first original character and a prototype to the Eternal Champion concept, Sojan is a deceased Terran who reincarnates on the planet Zylor and embarks on a series of picaresque adventures; interestingly, while he does wield a sword and a pneumatic gun, his actual signature weapon is a shield (hence the moniker of &quot;Sojan Shieldbearer&quot;). Sojan&#x27;s adventures first appeared around 1955 as a twenty-three parts serial on the &quot;Burroughsania&quot; fanzine, which Moorcock had been contributing to, were reprinted for profit in &quot;Tarzan Adventures&quot; between 1957 and 1958, and they were eventually fixed-up in book form in 1977; finally, the 2013 edition combined this serial together with other sword-and-planet short fiction focusing on Dek of Noothar, Klan the Spoiler, and Rens Karto of Bersnol.
* Umpata
* Ghardas Valabasian, Conqueror of the Distant Suns
* Graf Ulrich von Bek: a German soldier fighting in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Graf Ulrich is the leading character of the historical fantasy novel &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain&quot; (1981), in which he strikes a deal with the Devil and takes upon his family the duty of locating and guarding the Holy Grail; his Companion and Consort in this adventure are Gurni Gurnisson and Sabrina. Graf Ulrich&#x27;s actions reverberate through space and time by making the von Beks aware of the Multiverse, the designated owners of the sword Ravenbrand (which is, in fact, Mournblade from Elric&#x27;s series) and uniquely attuned to magic and dimensional travel, so that different members of the bloodline are involved in many other sagas and stand-alone episodes of the Eternal Champion mythos.Ulrich von Bek and his descendants are a somewhat unusual family in Moorcock&#x27;s works, as they function both as an aspect of the Eternal Champion and as a companion to him. The family is considered to be the current Keeper of the Holy Grail. The von Bek family motto is &quot;Do you the Devil&#x27;s work&quot;, a nod to the relationship that the family developed with Lucifer in &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain&quot;.
** Manfred von Bek: the main character of &quot;The City in the Autumn Stars&quot; (1986), a direct sequel to &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain,&quot; Manfred carries on Graf Ulrich&#x27;s quest for the Grail as Europe is engulfed by the French Revolution; he is aided by the Duchess of Crete, Libussa Cartagena y Mendoza-Chilperic. Due to their shared main plotline, &quot;The War Hound and the World&#x27;s Pain&quot; and &quot;The City in the Autumn Stars&quot; are usually collected together as the core of the &quot;Von Bek saga&quot;.
** Renark von Bek: a citizen of humankind&#x27;s stellar empire established in the aftermath of World War Three, Renark is tasked with traveling to a secluded dimension known as the Sundered Worlds so that he can stabilize the Multiverse and prevent its untimely collapse. He is the lead character in the novella &quot;The Sundered Worlds&quot; (1962), which was eventually combined with &quot;The Blood Red Game&quot; (1963) into the full-length novel &quot;The Sundered Worlds&quot; (1965).
** Rose von Bek: the last survivor of a militant order devoted to Balance, she was originally known as &quot;The Rose&quot;, but married into the von Bek family and kept the surname after her divorce. She is the titular coprotagonist in Elric&#x27;s novel &quot;The Revenge of the Rose&quot; (1991) and a leading character in the &quot;Second Ether&quot; trilogy. While no Championess herself, her cosmic power is comparable to that of the various Champions. Her signature weapons are the sword Swift Thorn and the dagger Little Thorn.
** Ulrich von Bek: a direct descendant of Graf Ulrich, he rebels against Adolf Hitler and escapes death by serving as an Eternal Companion to John Daker once the latter incarnates into Prince Flamadin during &quot;The Dragon in the Sword&quot;.
** Ulric von Bek: a distinct character from the former (notice the h-less spelling of his name), he too opposes the Third Reich together with his wife Oona von Bek, a half-human half-Melnibonéan hybrid who has relocated to 20th-century Germany. Ulric and Oona are the leading characters of the &quot;Moonbeam Roads Trilogy&quot; (2001–2005), an explicit crossover between Elric&#x27;s saga and the Von Beks&#x27;. 
** Count Ulrich Rudric Renark Otto von Bek-Krasny, also known as &quot;Zenith the Albino&quot;: an Eternal Champion existing on 20th-century Earth and most likely a reincarnated Elric of Melniboné, since his Black Sword is Stormbringer itself; he is a criminal mastermind and is perpetually engaged into a cat-and-mouse game against his distant cousin Sir Seaton Begg, a British &quot;metatemporal detective&quot; belonging to the English branch of the dynasty. Zenith and Begg&#x27;s shared adventure were composed anachronically and collected for the first time in &quot;The Metatemporal Detective&quot; (2007), while some of them had already appeared in the second volume of the &quot;Second Ether&quot; series, &quot;Fabulous Harbours&quot; (1995).
** Eric Beck: the main character of the graphic novel &quot;Elric: The Balance Lost&quot; (2011–2012), he is an Eternal Champion living on 21st Century Earth and gets dragged into an ensemble adventure together with Elric, Hawkmoon, Corum, Oswald Bastable, and the cast of the &quot;Second Ether&quot; series. His Black Sword is a Japanese katana named &quot;Murakamo-No-Tsurugi&quot; (&quot;Sword of the Gathering Clouds&quot;). He is a collateral member of the Von Bek dynasty through the Begg lineage (originally, van Beek). 
** Karol von Bek: the melancholy Duke of Waldenstein (mentioned in &quot;The Citadel of Forgotten Myths&quot;)

In addition to Moorcock&#x27;s own creations, a number of references through his works have stated that Ulysses and Roland have been Earth&#x27;s Eternal Champions as well.

==Publishing history==
===The Tale of the Eternal Champion===
Between 1992 and 1993 Moorcock partnered with British publisher Millenium (later absorbed into the Orion Publishing Group) to print a multi-volume collection of all novels and short stories belonging to the Eternal Champion sequence, under the moniker of &quot;The Tale of the Eternal Champion&quot;; starting from 1994 and up to 2000, a parallel project simply called &quot;The Eternal Champion&quot; was undertaken by White Wolf Publishing for the North American market, but each of the two series ended up including some contents left out of its counterpart due to licensing issues, while certain works could not make into the collection whatsoever. This publishing operation represented Moorcock&#x27;s first attempt to systematize his magnum opus both in terms of editorial uniformity and textual revisions.

The following table and paragraph list the full contents of both the European and North American versions of the collection. It should be noticed that the Orion collection was arranged according to Moorcock&#x27;s then-preferred reading order, which was altered in the White Wolf version.

Both versions of the collection included Elric&#x27;s saga, Corum&#x27;s hexalogy, Hawkmoon&#x27;s heptalogy, and the &quot;End of Time&quot; series as two-volumes sets and devoted one volume each to John Daker&#x27;s trilogy, Captain Bastable&#x27;s trilogy, and the von Bek duology (which was complemented by the detective short story &quot;The Pleasure Garden of Felipe Sagittarius&quot;); &quot;Sailing to Utopia&quot; was a thematical anthology combining &quot;The Ice Schooner&quot;, &quot;The Distant Suns&quot;, &quot;The Black Corridor&quot; and the novella &quot;Flux&quot;, and likewise &quot;Earl Aubec and Other Stories&quot; collected thirty-three works of short fiction from across Moorcock&#x27;s production, among them the two short stories focussing on the Scared-Face Brooder and the short novels &quot;The Golden Barge&quot; and &quot;My Experiences in the Third World War&quot;.

As for region-exclusive contents, the European-only &quot;The New Nature of the Catastrophe&quot; was an anthology of short fiction centered upon Jerry Cornelius, expanding upon the earlier collection &quot;The Lives and Times of Jerry Cornelius&quot;, whereas the North American-only &quot;Kane of Old Mars&quot; collected Michael Kane&#x27;s trilogy. Moreover, White Wolf Publishing did secure the rights over the stand-alone science fiction novels &quot;The Sundered World&quot;, &quot;The Wrecks of Time&quot;, &quot;The Winds of Limbo&quot;, and &quot;The Shores of Death&quot;, but their inclusion came at the expense of Moorcock&#x27;s preferred reading order: &quot;The Sundered World&quot; was inserted into John Daker&#x27;s volume as an interlude between that character&#x27;s first and second novel; Daker&#x27;s third novel was moved into the von Bek volume as a coda; and &quot;The Wrecks of Time&quot;, &quot;The Winds of Limbo&quot;, and &quot;The Shores of Death&quot; were collected into the thematical anthology &quot;The Roads Between the Worlds&quot;, which interconnected the three novels through an original framing device.

It is also worth mentioning that the first edition of the &quot;Second Ether&quot; trilogy was published by Millenium itself right after &quot;The Tale of the Eternal Champion&quot; was completed, and that while Jerry Cornelius&#x27;s and Karl Glogauer&#x27;s novels were not formally included in the series, nonetheless they were still being distributed in the UK by Orion under its Phoenix House imprint, together with Moorcock&#x27;s non-Champion novels &quot;Gloriana; or, the Unfulfill&#x27;d Queen&quot; and &quot;The Brothel in Rosenstrasse&quot;. As a result, Jerry Cornell&#x27;s duology was the only series in the Eternal Champion mythos not to be included in either collection, nor officially nor informally.

===The Michael Moorcock Collection===
Moorcock&#x27;s second attempt to systematize the Eternal Champion corpus took place between 2013 and 2015, once Victor Gollancz Ltd (another imprint of the Orion conglomerate) secured the rights for all of his fantasy and science-fiction works and consequently reprinted them in a cohesive series, labeled as &quot;The Michael Moorcock Collection&quot;; as of 2021, these Gollancz editions represent the most updated versions of Moorcock&#x27;s opus, due to their contents having been jointly revised by the author and his bibliographer John Davey into a definitive textual rendition. This publication included both all of the author&#x27;s full-length novels and a selection of short fiction and was eventually complemented by two stand-alone series collecting the author&#x27;s non-Champion sagas, the &quot;London Sequence&quot; and &quot;The Sanctuary of the White Friars&quot;.

The following table and paragraph list the full contents of the collection.
The Collection was further complemented by five digital-only releases:
* Jerry Cornell&#x27;s series:
*# &quot;The Chinese Agent&quot; (1970)
*# &quot;The Russian Intelligence&quot; (1980)
* &quot;The Golden Barge&quot; (1979, but originally composed in 1958)
* &quot;Sojan the Swordsman&quot; (1977, but originally composed in 1954–1958)
* &quot;The Distant Suns&quot; (1975, but originally composed in 1969)
As of 2021, Gollancz has not yet acquired the rights for the &quot;Pyat Quartet&quot;, consisting of:
#&quot;Byzantium Endures&quot; (1981)
#&quot;The Laughter of Carthage&quot; (1984)
#&quot;Jerusalem Commands&quot; (1992)
#&quot;The Vengeance of Rome&quot; (2006)

<doc id="177218" wikidata="Q4037666" url="?curid=177218" title="Ducks Deluxe">
<text>Ducks Deluxe are an English pub rock band of the 1970s, who continue to tour and record new material. Usually called &quot;The Ducks&quot; by their fans, they were known for up-tempo, energetic performances, and the successful careers of their members, after they disbanded.

==History==
The band formed in February 1972, with ex Brinsley Schwarz roadie Martin Belmont on guitar, former Help Yourself collaborator Sean Tyla, also on guitar, ex Help Yourself bassist Ken Whaley, and Magic Michael (Michael Cousins) on percussion. They named themselves after a slot machine at the Severn Bridge Service Station. Cousins was soon replaced by drummer Tim Roper and former Flamin&#x27; Groovies roadie, Nick Garvey, also joined. Playing more energetic music than most others on the London pub-rock circuit, the Ducks soon had a twice weekly booking at the Tally Ho in Kentish Town, and a manager, Dai Davies.

Whaley left, and later rejoined Help Yourself, and in December 1972, the Ducks recorded two tracks at Man&#x27;s Christmas party, one of which,&quot;Boogaloo Babe&quot;, was released on a double 10&quot; album &quot;Christmas at the Patti&quot;, their first appearance on a record.

In 1973, the band signed to RCA and released their first single, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, written by Sean Tyla and Nick Garvey, though Tyla is not credited on the track, because he was trying to untangle himself from a previous publishing deal. They also appeared in BBC TV &quot;Play for Today&quot; called &quot;Blooming Youth&quot;. Their eponymous debut album &quot;Ducks Deluxe&quot; was released in early 1974, and &quot;captures something of the fire and excitement that the Ducks&#x27; live act generated&quot;. Keyboard and bass player Andy McMaster joined from The Sabres, to record a second album, &quot;Taxi To The Terminal Zone&quot;, but this was regarded as disappointing and McMaster left. The band recorded its first Peel Session in April 1974, after which Garvey left and bassist Micky Groome joined. Despite recording a second Peel Session in March 1975, RCA dropped the band, so they were reduced to issuing an EP, &quot;Jumpin&quot; on the French label Skydog. 
Tim Roper left so former Brinsley Schwarz members Brinsley Schwarz and Billy Rankin played on the final tour, with the final gig being at the 100 Club in London on 1 July 1975.

In 1978, RCA Victor released the compilation album &quot;Don&#x27;t Mind Rockin&#x27; Tonite&quot;, featuring six songs from the band&#x27;s debut LP, three from &quot;Taxi to the Terminal Zone&quot; (unavailable in the US at the time), and a few non-album singles. Reviewing the compilation in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;The music is pure rock and roll, maybe too pure, combining the Rumour&#x27;s spirited intensity and the Motors&#x27; cheerful manipulation at a more primitive stage. Fans of the Tyla Gang will dig it.&quot;

==Later careers==
Nick Garvey and Andy McMaster formed The Motors, with Rob Hendry (later replaced by Bram Tchaikovsky) and drummer Ricky Slaughter.

Sean Tyla formed &quot;The Tyla Gang&quot;, which would later include Ken Whaley, who had joined Man after Help Yourself broke up. The Tyla Gang featured Canadian Bruce Irvinere and the former Winkies rhythm section of Brian Turrington on bass and Mike Desmarais on drums. They released two albums, &quot;Yachtless&quot; and &quot;Moonproof&quot; on the US-based, Beserkley label before the label&#x27;s UK operation went bankrupt in 1978 and the band disbanded. Tyla embarked on a solo career and released three albums, &quot;Just Popped Out&quot;, &quot;Redneck In Babylon&quot; and &quot;Rhythm Of The Swing&quot;, the first of which produced Tyla&#x27;s first Top ten single, &quot;Breakfast In Marin&quot;, in Germany in 1980. Tyla and Micky Groome along with drummer, Paul Simmons then joined Man&#x27;s Deke Leonard to form &quot;The Force&quot;, until Tyla decided to retire from the music business completely, due to ill health. Groome stayed with Leonard to reform &quot;Deke Leonard&#x27;s Iceberg&quot;.

Brinsley Schwarz and Martin Belmont joined Brinsley&#x27;s former keyboard player Bob Andrews to support Graham Parker as Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour, as well as appearing without Parker, as &quot;The Rumour&quot;. Belmont later played in Carlene Carter&#x27;s CC Riders and Nick Lowe&#x27;s Cowboy Outfit.

Roper, the original drummer, moved to Norwich, where he became a well-known figure in local bands. He died in February 2003 from alcohol-related symptoms, following a nervous breakdown.

The first album, &quot;Ducks Deluxe&quot;, achieved moderate commercial success after the band broke up, because the members had gone on to greater fame in Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour, The Tyla Gang and The Motors.

==Reunion==
The band reformed to celebrate the 35th anniversary of their original formation. This was at the 100 Club in London on 9 October 2007. The line-up was Martin Belmont, Sean Tyla, Micky Groome and Billy Rankin. A further gig took place on 9 November at The Musician in Leicester. On 26 January 2008, they played Centre Culturel de Paul Baillart, Massy, near Paris, France. On 20 September 2008, they played the PopXiria Festival in Carballo, near A Coruña in Spain, headlining the final night of the event.

In 2009, Ducks Deluxe toured Sweden from 29 March to 13 April. The band consisted of Sean Tyla, vocals and guitar; Martin Belmont, guitar and vocals; Kevin Foster (of Hank Wangford &amp; the Lost Cowboys and Los Pisteleros fame) bass guitar and backing vocals; and Jim Russell, (ex Stretch, Wild Angels, and The Inmates) on drums. They released their first new material, a mini CD &quot;Box Of Shorts&quot; on 18 May 2009, comprising six new studio tracks, produced by Paul &#x27;Bassman&#x27; Riley.

A new full album, &quot;Side Tracks And Smokers&quot;, was released in June 2010 with artwork by famous Stiff Records designer Tobbe Stuhre, and tracks including some recently found and remastered raw mixes of tracks from the early albums, and also some brand new Ducks Deluxe recordings. It was followed in 2011 by a lo-fi live recording, &quot;Riviera Shuffle&quot; on Jungle Records which was only available through mail order.

The band completed a 40th Anniversary Tour in early 2012, featuring Brinsley Schwarz back in the line-up after a 37-year absence. Later that year the group recorded a live album in London, &quot;Rockin&#x27; at the Moon&quot;, which was released in 2013.

<doc id="177219" wikidata="Q746676" url="?curid=177219" title="Industrial Light &amp; Magic">
<text>Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) is an American motion picture visual effects, computer animation and stereo conversion digital studio that was founded on May 26, 1975 by George Lucas. It is a division of the film production company Lucasfilm, which Lucas founded, and was created when he began production on the original &quot;Star Wars&quot;, now the fourth episode of the Skywalker Saga.

ILM originated in Van Nuys, California, then later moved to San Rafael in 1978, and since 2005 it has been based at the Letterman Digital Arts Center in the Presidio of San Francisco. In 2012, The Walt Disney Company acquired ILM as part of its purchase of Lucasfilm. As of 2025, Industrial Light &amp; Magic has won 16 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects.

== History ==
Lucas wanted his 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; to include visual effects that had never been seen on film before. After discovering that the in-house effects department at 20th Century Fox was no longer operational, Lucas approached Douglas Trumbull, best known for the effects on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and &quot;Silent Running&quot; (1972). Trumbull declined as he was already committed to working on Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), but suggested his assistant John Dykstra to Lucas. Dykstra brought together a small team of college students, artists, and engineers and set them up in a warehouse in Van Nuys, California. After seeing the map for the location was zoned as light industrial, Lucas named the group Industrial Light and Magic, which became the Special Visual Effects department on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Alongside Dykstra, other leading members of the original ILM team were Ken Ralston, Richard Edlund, Dennis Muren, Robert Blalack, Joe Johnston, Phil Tippett, Steve Gawley, Lorne Peterson, and Paul Huston.
In late 1978, when in pre-production for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Lucas reformed most of the team into Industrial Light &amp; Magic in Marin County, California. From here on, the company expanded and has since gone on to produce special effects for over three hundred films, including the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga, the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, and the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; series.

After the success of the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie, Lucas became interested in using computer graphics on the sequel. He contacted Triple-I, known for their early computer effects in movies like &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973), &quot;Futureworld&quot; (1976), &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; which ended up making a computer-generated test of five X-wing fighters flying in formation. He found it to be too expensive and returned to handmade models. Nevertheless, the test had showed him it was possible, and he decided he would create his own computer graphics department instead. As a result, they started investing in Apple and SGI computers. One of Lucas&#x27; employees was given the task to find the right people to hire. His search would lead him to NYIT, where he found Edwin Catmull and his colleagues. Catmull and others accepted Lucas&#x27; job offer, and a new computer division at Lucasfilm was created in 1979, which technically belonged to another division than ILM, with the hiring of Ed Catmull as the first NYIT employee who joined the company. Lucas&#x27; list for them was a digital film editing system, a digital sound editing system, a laser film printer, and further exploration of computer graphics. John Lasseter, who was hired a few years later, worked on computer-animation as part of ILM&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The Graphics Group was later sold to Steve Jobs, named Pixar Animation Studios, and created the first CGI-animated feature, &quot;Toy Story&quot;. In 2000, ILM created the OpenEXR format for high-dynamic-range imaging.
ILM operated from an inconspicuous property in San Rafael, California until 2005. The company was known to locals as The Kerner Company, a name that did not draw any attention, allowing the company to operate in secret, thus preventing the compromise of sensitive information on its productions to the media or fans. In 2005, when Lucas decided to move locations to the Presidio of San Francisco and focus on digital effects, a management-led team bought the five physical and practical effects divisions and formed a new company that included the George Lucas Theater, retained the &quot;Kerner&quot; name as Kerner Technologies, Inc. and provided physical effects for major motion pictures, often working with ILM, until its Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2011.

In 2005, ILM extended its operations to Lucasfilm Singapore, which also includes the Singapore arm of Lucasfilm Animation. In 2006, ILM invented IMoCap (Image Based Motion Capture Technology). By 2007, ILM was one of the largest visual effects vendors in the motion picture industry and had one of the largest render farms (named Death Star). In 2011, it was announced the company was considering a project-based facility in Vancouver. ILM first opened a temporary facility in Vancouver before relocating to a new 30,000-square-foot studio on Water Street in the Gastown district in 2014.

In October 2012, Disney bought ILM&#x27;s parent company, Lucasfilm, acquiring ILM, Skywalker Sound, and LucasArts in the process. Disney stated that it had no immediate plans to change ILM&#x27;s operations, but began to lay off employees by April of the next year. Following the restructuring of LucasArts in April 2013, ILM was left overstaffed and the faculty was reduced to serve only ILM&#x27;s visual effects department. ILM opened a London studio headquartered in the city&#x27;s Soho district on October 15, 2014.

On November 7, 2018, ILM opened a new division targeted at television series called &quot;ILM TV&quot;. It will be based in ILM&#x27;s new 47,000-square-foot London studio with support from the company&#x27;s locations in San Francisco, Vancouver and Singapore. In July 2019, ILM announced the opening of a new facility in Sydney, Australia. In the same year, ILM introduced StageCraft. Also known as &quot;The Volume&quot;, it uses high-definition LED video walls to generate virtual sceneries and was first used in &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Fox VFX Lab was folded into ILM, including the Technoprops division. In October 2022, ILM opened a new studio in Mumbai. In May 2023, ILMxLAB was rebranded as ILM Immersive.

In August 2023, Lucasfilm announced it would close the ILM studio in Singapore due to economic factors affecting the industry and the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes. The closure affected 340 Singapore-based jobs. Employees continued working until the end of the year. Disney confirmed that it would be helping employees to either find work with local companies with similar skills requirements or relocate to ILM&#x27;s other studios in London, Vancouver, Sydney and Mumbai. An ILM Singapore employee confirmed that the closure of the Singaporean studio was linked to the strike.

== Notable employees and clients ==
Photoshop was first used at Industrial Light &amp; Magic as an image-processing program. Photoshop was created by ILM Visual Effects Supervisor John Knoll and his brother Thomas as a summer project. It was used on &quot;The Abyss&quot;. The Knoll brothers sold the program to Adobe in 1989. Thomas Knoll continues to work on Photoshop at Adobe and is featured in the billing on the Photoshop splash screen. John Knoll continues to be ILM&#x27;s top visual effects supervisor, and was one of the executive producers and writers of &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;.

In addition to their work for George Lucas, ILM also collaborates with Steven Spielberg on many films that he directs and produces. Dennis Muren has acted as Computer Animation Supervisor on many of these films. For &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in 1993, ILM used the program Viewpaint, which allowed the visual effects artists to paint color and texture directly onto the surface of the computer models. Former ILM CG Animator Steve &quot;Spaz&quot; Williams said that it took nearly a year for the shots that involved computer-generated dinosaurs to be completed. The film is noted for its groundbreaking use of computer-generated imagery, and is regarded as a landmark for visual effects. The company also works on more subtle special effects—such as widening streets, digitally adding more extras to a shot, and inserting the film&#x27;s actors into preexisting footage—in films such as in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in 1994.

Adam Savage, Grant Imahara and Tory Belleci of &quot;MythBusters&quot; fame have all worked at ILM.

ILM is also famous for their commercial work. Their clients include Energizer, and Oldsmobile. They also animated Yoda for a series of 2012 commercials for Vodafone, which were broadcast in the UK.

Actor Masi Oka worked on several major ILM productions as a programmer, including &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, before joining the cast of the NBC show &quot;Heroes&quot; as Hiro Nakamura.

American film director David Fincher worked at ILM for four years in the early 1980s.

Film director Joe Johnston was a Visual effects artist and an Art Director.

Film director Mark A.Z. Dippé was a Visual Effects animator who directed &quot;Spawn&quot; which was released in 1997.

Sound editor and film producer James &quot;Jim&quot; Nelson served as an associate producer of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; and helped build Industrial Light &amp; Magic alongside George Lucas, overseeing the company&#x27;s administration and management.

<text>James Chambers, OM (born 30 July 1944), known professionally as Jimmy Cliff, is a Jamaican ska, rocksteady, reggae and soul musician, multi-instrumentalist, singer, and actor. He is the only living reggae musician to hold the Order of Merit, the highest honour that can be granted by the Jamaican government for achievements in the arts and sciences. 

Cliff is best known among mainstream audiences for songs such as &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot;, &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot;, &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, &quot;Reggae Night&quot;, and &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;, and his covers of Cat Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Wild World&quot; and Johnny Nash&#x27;s &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; from the film &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;. He starred in the film &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, which helped popularize reggae around the world, and &quot;Club Paradise&quot;. Cliff was one of five performers inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Early life and education==
Jimmy Cliff was born James Chambers on 30 July 1944 in Saint James, Colony of Jamaica. He began writing songs while still at primary school in St. James, listening to a neighbour&#x27;s sound system. When Chambers was 14, his father took him to Kingston, where he would take up the stage name Jimmy Cliff.

==Career==
===1960s and 1970s===
Cliff sought out many producers while still going to school, trying to get his songs recorded without success. He also entered talent contests. &quot;One night I was walking past a record store and restaurant as they were closing, pushed myself in and convinced one of them, Leslie Kong, to go into the recording business, starting with me,&quot; he writes in his own website biography. After two singles that failed to make much impression, his career took off when &quot;Hurricane Hattie&quot; became a hit while he was aged 17. It was produced by Kong, with whom Cliff remained until Kong&#x27;s death from a heart attack in 1971.

Cliff&#x27;s later local hit singles included &quot;King of Kings&quot;, &quot;Dearest Beverley&quot;, &quot;Miss Jamaica&quot;, and &quot;Pride and Passion&quot;. In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of Jamaica&#x27;s representatives at the World&#x27;s Fair in New York; and in the same year Cliff was featured in a program called &quot;This is Ska!&quot; alongside Prince Buster, Toots and the Maytals, and Byron Lee and the Dragonaires. 

He soon signed to Island Records and moved to the United Kingdom. Island Records initially (and unsuccessfully) tried to sell Cliff to the rock audience, but his career took off in the late 1960s. His international debut album was &quot;Hard Road to Travel&quot;, released in 1967. It received excellent reviews and included &quot;Waterfall&quot; (composed by Nirvana&#x27;s Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons), which became a hit in Brazil and won the International Song Festival.

&quot;Waterfall&quot; was followed in 1969 by &quot;Wonderful World, Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Vietnam&quot; in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. Bob Dylan called &quot;Vietnam&quot; the best protest song he had ever heard. Also during this period, Cliff released a cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Wild World&quot; as a single, but it was not included on his &quot;Wonderful World, Beautiful People&quot; album.

In 1972, Cliff starred as Ivanhoe &quot;Ivan&quot; Martin in the classic reggae film, &quot;The Harder They Come&quot;, directed by Perry Henzell. As the film tells Martin&#x27;s story, he is a young man without funds. Arriving in Kingston from the country, he tries to make it in the recording business, but without success. Eventually, he turns to a life of crime. The soundtrack album of the film was a huge success that sold well around the world, bringing reggae to an international audience for the first time. It remains one of the most internationally significant films to have come out of Jamaica since independence. The film made its debut at London&#x27;s Gaumont cinema in Notting Hill on 1 September 1972. 

In 1975, Cliff sang on the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, episode 12, hosted by Dick Cavett. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa (the Nigeria-based Jamaican writer Lindsay Barrett was instrumental in Cliff&#x27;s first trip there), and subsequently converted to Islam, taking the name of El Hadj Naïm Bachir. In a 2021 interview, Cliff expressed a strong affinity with the religious and intellectual knowledge of ancient Egypt, scepticism of government handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and denied his earlier conversion to Islam, claiming it &quot;didn&#x27;t satisfy my soul.&quot;

===1980s and 1990s===
Cliff quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with Kool &amp; the Gang. In 1984, Cliff appeared at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, Netherlands. During The River Tour, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band added Cliff&#x27;s previously little-known song &quot;Trapped&quot; to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985&#x27;s &quot;We Are the World&quot; benefit album. The follow-up, &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot; (1985), won a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album, though it was his last major success in the United States until 1993. Also in 1985, Cliff contributed to the song &quot;Sun City&quot;, a protest song written and composed by Steven Van Zandt and recorded by Artists United Against Apartheid to convey opposition to the South African policy of apartheid.

Cliff then provided backing vocals on The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1986 album &quot;Dirty Work&quot;, and appeared in the comedy &quot;Club Paradise&quot;, co-starring with Robin Williams and Peter O&#x27;Toole, and contributed several songs to the soundtrack, including &quot;Seven Day Weekend&quot;, which he sang with Elvis Costello. In 1988, his song &quot;Shelter of Your Love&quot; was featured in the 1988 film &quot;Cocktail&quot;.

Cliff appeared in the film &quot;Marked for Death&quot; in 1990, performing &quot;John Crow&quot; with the Jimmy Cliff Band. His recording of &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot; was used as a campaign anthem by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in the 1990 election in Nicaragua. In 1991, he performed at the second Rock in Rio festival in Estádio do Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He continued to sell well in Jamaica and, to a lesser extent, the UK, returning to the mainstream pop charts in the U.S. and elsewhere (#1 in France) with a version of Johnny Nash&#x27;s &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; on the &quot;Cool Runnings&quot; film soundtrack in 1993. In 1995, Cliff released the single &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot;, a collaboration with Lebo M, a song from the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Lion King&quot;. In 1997, Cliff was a guest star in an episode of the Cartoon Network talk show &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.

===2000 to present===
In 2001, Cliff became an inaugural member of the Independent Music Awards&#x27; judging panel to support independent artists. In 2002, Cliff released the album &quot;Fantastic Plastic People&quot; in Europe, after first providing free downloads using p2p software. This album featured collaborations with Joe Strummer, Annie Lennox, and Sting as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff&#x27;s original hits. In 2004, Cliff completely reworked the songs, dropping the traditional reggae in favour of an electronic sound, for inclusion in &quot;Black Magic&quot;. The album also included a recording of &quot;Over the Border&quot; with Joe Strummer. Cliff performed at the closing ceremony to the 2002 Commonwealth Games and in 2003, his song &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot; was included in the soundtrack to the film, &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;. He also appeared in July 2003 at the Paléo Festival in Nyon, Switzerland. The Jamaican government under P. J. Patterson honoured Cliff on 20 October 2003, by awarding him The Order of Merit, the nation&#x27;s fourth-highest honour, in recognition of his contributions to the film and music of Jamaica. Cliff and Mervyn Morris are the only currently living figures from the arts to hold this distinction and Cliff is the only living musician to do so.

In 2007, Cliff performed at the opening ceremony at cricket&#x27;s World Cup. In the spring and summer of 2010, Cliff embarked on an extensive tour of the U.S. and Canada. In 2007, &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want&quot; was adopted by the British Conservative Party during their annual conference. He was quoted in &quot;The Independent&quot; as saying, &quot;One of my band mates called me this morning to tell me the news. I can&#x27;t stop them using the song, but I&#x27;m not a supporter of politics. I have heard of Cameron, but I&#x27;m not a supporter. I don&#x27;t support any politician. I just believe in right or wrong.&quot;

In September 2009, he was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following a campaign on his behalf by the American Charles Earle. Cliff reacted to the news by saying, &quot;This is good for Cliff, good for Jamaican music and good for my country.&quot; On 15 December 2009, he was officially announced as an inductee and was inducted on 15 March 2010 by Wyclef Jean.

Cliff appeared in the 2011 documentary &quot;Reggae Got Soul: The Story of Toots and the Maytals&quot; which was featured on BBC and described as &quot;The untold story of one of the most influential artists ever to come out of Jamaica&quot;.

In 2011, Cliff worked with producer Tim Armstrong, lead singer of American punk band Rancid, on the EP &quot;The Sacred Fire&quot; and the full-length album &quot;Rebirth&quot;. &quot;Rebirth&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. The album was listed at #12 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the top 50 albums of 2012, saying &quot;There&#x27;s ska, rock steady, roots reggae, a revelatory cover of The Clash&#x27;s &quot;Guns of Brixton&quot; delivered in Cliff&#x27;s trademark soulful tenor, grittier but still lovely more than 40 years after his debut.&quot; 

In December 2012, Cliff was named Artist of the Year by digital newspaper the Caribbean Journal, citing his work on &quot;Rebirth&quot;.

In August 2022, Cliff released the album &quot;Refugees&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cliff was briefly a member of the Rastafari movement before converting to Islam from Christianity. He now describes himself as having a &quot;universal outlook on life&quot;, and does not align himself with any particular movement or religion, saying, &quot;now I believe in science&quot;. He is married and has a daughter, Lilty Cliff, and a son, Aken Cliff. He is also the father of the actress/singer Nabiyah Be.

<doc id="177221" wikidata="Q908741" url="?curid=177221" title="Luzon Strait">
<text>The Luzon Strait (Tagalog: &quot;Kipot ng Luzon&quot;, ) is the strait between Luzon and Taiwan. The strait thereby connects the Philippine Sea to the South China Sea in the western Pacific Ocean.

This body of water is an important strait for shipping and communications. Many ships from the Americas use this route to go to important East Asian ports. Many submarine communications cables pass through the Luzon Strait. These cables provide important data and telephony services to mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.

== Description ==
The Luzon Strait is approximately wide containing a number of islands belonging to the Philippines that are grouped into two: the islands comprising the province of Batanes and the Babuyan Islands, which are part of the province of Cagayan. The strait is divided into a number of smaller channels. The Babuyan Channel separates Luzon from the Babuyan Islands, which is separated from Batanes by the . Batanes is separated from Taiwan by the Bashi Channel.

Some of the largest ocean waves in the world, at times over 170 meters in height and stemming from tides and ocean currents, are found in the north of the strait. These waves or currents are underwater and rarely break the surface, thus posing no danger to shipping but are sometimes visible to satellites. The oscillation is largely prompted by a long north–south ridge which covers almost all of the strait, then amplified in the northern section by a second parallel ridge. The depth of the strait reaches the 3,500 m and 4,000 contours in north–south trenches in the middle and south-western edge.

== History ==

The Luzon Strait was part of the Japanese invasion route during the Second World War. On December 8, 1941 (the same day as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, due to the International Date Line), forces of the Empire of Japan landed on Batanes. By December 10, they had occupied Camiguin de Babuyanes in the Babuyan Islands (not to be confused with the island-province of Camiguin off northern Mindanao) in a soon-abandoned attempt to establish a seaplane base, and on the same day landed at Aparri, Cagayan on Luzon.

Subsequently, during the Second World War, many US submarines hunted Japanese convoys passing through the strait on their way from the East Indies to Japan.

<text>Bodyboarding is a water sport in which the surfer rides a bodyboard on the crest, face, and curl of a wave which is carrying the surfer towards the shore. Bodyboarding is also referred to as Boogieboarding due to the invention of the &quot;Boogie Board&quot; by Tom Morey in 1971. The average bodyboard consists of a short, rectangular piece of hydrodynamic foam. Bodyboarders typically use swim fins for additional propulsion and control while riding a breaking wave.

== Origin ==
Bodyboarding originates from an ancient form of riding waves (surfing) on one&#x27;s belly. Indigenous Polynesians rode &quot;alaia&quot; (pronounced ah-lie-ah) boards either on their belly, knees, or feet (in rare instances). &quot;Alaia&quot; boards were generally made from the wood of &quot;Acacia koa&quot; and varied in length and shape. They are distinct from the modern stand-up surfboards in that they had no ventral fins. Captain Cook recorded seeing Hawaiian villagers riding such boards when he came to Hawaii in 1778.

The boards he witnessed were about and were ridden prone (on the belly) or on the knees. &quot;Alaia&quot; boards then evolved into the more modern &quot;paipo&quot; (pronounced pipe-oh) board. &quot;Paipo&quot; boards were either made of wood or fiberglass. Fiberglass boards usually had fins on the bottom. Tom Morey hybridized this form of riding waves on one&#x27;s belly on a paipo to his craft of shaping stand-up surfboards.

== Different riding forms ==
Bodyboards are shaped to the rider&#x27;s specific needs and preferences such as height, weight, and form of riding. Three basic forms of riding a bodyboard include prone, dropknee, and stand-up.

=== Prone ===

Riding prone refers to when one rides the wave on their stomach. When the bodyboarder goes left, they place their left hand on the upper left corner of the nose and place their right arm halfway down the rail of the right side of the board. The opposite is true of when the bodyboarder goes right.
=== Dropknee ===

Dropknee is when one places their preferred fin forward on the front of the deck with the opposing knee on the bottom end of the board with their fin dragging in the water. Dropknee was first pioneered in the late 1970s by Hawaii&#x27;s Jack &quot;The Ripper&quot; Lindholm and sometimes referred to as &quot;Jack Stance&quot;. Unlike fiberglass stand-up surfboards, the bodyboards dropknee riders use don&#x27;t have fins underneath to help maintain a line on the face of a wave or to stop them sliding out so dropknee riders rely on weight transition from rail to rail to hold a line on a wave and turn/snap. On the other hand, the benefit of not having fins underneath the board is that a rider can spin 360 (forward and reverse).
=== Stand-up ===
Stand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air. While it isn&#x27;t quite as popular as the other two forms of riding a bodyboard, three notable figures that popularized it are Danny Kim, Cavin Yap, and Chris Won Taloa.

== The board ==

=== Materials ===
The bodyboard differs from a surfboard in that it is much shorter (typically in length) and made out of different types of foam. The modern board consists of a foam &#x27;core&#x27; encapsulated by a plastic bottom, a softer foam top known as the deck, and softer foam sides known as the rails. The core is made of dow/polyethylene, arcel, polystyrene, or Polypro/polypropylene. The bottom is made of Surlyn, HDPE or Bixby. The deck is made of 8LB or CrossLink. Each type of foam core, deck, or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control. Speed from the bottom turn is increased when a bodyboarder bottom turns and the board flexes and recoils, releasing energy. If the board flexes too little or too easily, speed is lost. Dow (polyethylene) cores are best suited to cooler waters as they can be too flexible in warm water. Arcel and Polypro (polypropylene) cores are best suited for warmer waters due to their increased overall stiffness.

Most boards on the market today contain one, two, or three rods (usually of carbon or graphite), referred to as stringers, to strengthen the board, reduce deformation, add stiffness and recoil to the core, thus providing greater speed off bottom turns and transitions on the wave. If a single stringer is used, it is placed in the center of the board running parallel to the rails. If two are used, they are placed symmetrically about the y-axis. Triple stringers are a combination of the placement of both a single and double stringer.

=== Construction ===
Deck, rails, and bottom are bonded via various hot air lamination techniques to the core. Previous to the lamination technique, shapers accomplished this by using glue.

=== Features ===
The shape, or curve, of the board affects how it rides. If the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose, the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder&#x27;s weight rests further up on the board. Boards with more parallel rails or a narrow nose tend to be more ideal for drop-knee and stand-up riding as the rider&#x27;s center of gravity tends to rest further back.

Most modern boards are equipped with channels that increase surface area in the critical parts of the board which, in turn, allow it to have varying hold and control on the wave. Originally, skegs were installed to decrease slippage on a wave face. However, progressive bodyboarding has rendered use of such skegs obsolete due to the looseness required for maneuverability on a wave. For such reasons, skegs are rarely used today and, even then, almost exclusively by dropknee or stand-up bodyboarders.

Tail shapes influence the way that boards perform in the line-up. Crescent tails provide the greatest amount of hold in steep waves. Crescent tails are generally preferred by drop-knee riders because the shape interferes less. Crescent tails are also preferred by beginners, due to being able to perform well in varying conditions. Bat tails provide looseness for rail to rail transitions. Prone riders tend to prefer bat tails more than dropknee riders.

== Progression ==
From the conception of the modern bodyboard in 1971, bodyboarding has experienced spurts of rapid growth both as an industry and extreme sport. With its origins in America, over the past decade the industry has shifted from a primarily American to a global industry phenomena. The sport has grown into a worldwide industry with growing strongholds in Australia, South American countries like Peru and Chile, Japan, Canary Islands (Spain), South Africa, and so forth. The evolution of maneuvers and waves in which it is being done have rendered it one of the most extreme wave riding forms in the world.

Bodyboarders have been accredited with pioneering some of the world&#x27;s heaviest, most renowned surf locations in the world: Teahupo&#x27;o, French Polynesia; Shark Island, Australia; El Fronton, Spain; Cyclops, Australia; Ours, Australia; Luna Park, Australia; etc. In addition, bodyboarders place strong emphasis on aerial maneuvers on bigger, heavier sections of waves. These include aerial 360s, ARS (Air Roll Spin), el rollos, inverts (tweaking the board with the momentum of the wave and then swinging it back), backflips, ATS (Aéreo Thiago Schmitd) and variations/hybrids of these maneuvers are also performed.

== Male bodyboarders ==

* Mike Stewart (Hawaii, USA) is considered the father of modern bodyboarding, acclaimed as one of the best wave riders of all time, and holds nine world titles. He is also the only bodyboarder to receive the Mr. Pipeline title.
* Ben Severson (Hawaii, USA) is a pioneer of bodyboarding, world champion, and competitive rival of Mike Stewart for over fifteen years.
* Guilherme Tamega (Brazil) is second only to Stewart for number of world titles, holding six. He has gained reputation and fame for his aggressive riding style and approach in both small and heavy surf.
* Mike &quot;Eppo&quot; Eppulston is the first Australian and also the first non-Hawaiian to win the World Title (1993). He is also known for creating the ARS and backflip.
* Jeff Hubbard (Hawaii, USA) is best known for his phenomenal aerial approach to bodyboarding. He currently holds three world titles.
* Ryan Hardy (Australia) is influential in the progression of Australian and international bodyboarding. Known for his fluid yet powerful style of surfing.
* Ben Player (Australia) is also considered one of the greatest influences in bodyboarding both Australia and the world. He holds three world titles.
* Andre Botha (South Africa) is the youngest athlete to win the world title (1998). He then won a second world title the next tour season of 1999. Known for his extreme approach to wave riding in shorebreaks and heavy waves.
* Alexandre de Pontes (Xandinho), was the first Brazilian to reach the finals in the Pipeline world bodyboarding championship. Six-time world champion Guilherme Tâmega considers Xandinho one of the greatest bodyboarders of all time.
* Hugo Pinheiro was placed second at the ISA World Surfing Games in 2006.

== Female bodyboarders ==
Phylis Dameron was the first person, man or woman, to ride big Waimea Bay on a bodyboard in the late 1970s. During the early 1990s in Brazil, Mariana Nogueira, Glenda Koslowski, and Stephanie Petterson set standards that pushed women&#x27;s bodyboarding to a world class level. Stephanie Petterson won the first official World Championship of Women&#x27;s Bodyboarding at Pipeline in 1990. It was the first women&#x27;s event ever held there and initiated the longest running women&#x27;s wave sport event in the world. 2009 marked the event&#x27;s 20th anniversary.
* Alexandra Rinder is the top ranked female bodyboarder in the world.
* Sari Ohhara is the third ranked top female bodyboarder in the world.
* Jessica Becker is the fourth ranked top female bodyboarder in the world.

==World Champions==
From 1982 to 1993, the winner of the International Morey Boogie Bodyboard Pro Championships at Pipeline, Hawaii was considered world champion. Since then a world tour has determined the sport&#x27;s champion. The world tour has been administered by a variety of organisations.

<text>William Henry Johnson ( or – April 9, 1926), known as Zip the Pinhead, was an American freak show performer known for his tapered head.

==Early life==
William Henry Johnson was likely born in New Jersey, and was one of six children in a very poor African-American family. His parents were William and Mahalia Johnson, former slaves. As he grew, his body developed normally, but his head remained small. His tapering cranium and heavy jaw made him attractive to agents from van Emburgh&#x27;s Circus in Somerville, New Jersey. His appearance caused many to believe that he was a &quot;pinhead&quot;, or microcephalic. Microcephaly patients are characterized by a small, tapering cranium and often have impaired mental faculty. It is arguable, however, whether he was intellectually disabled.

Johnson&#x27;s parents agreed to allow the circus to display him in return for money. He was billed as a missing link, supposedly caught in Africa and displayed in a cage. He was a popular attraction, and his success led his agent to show his charge to showman P.T. Barnum.

Barnum purchased the right to display Johnson from the circus and gave him a new look. A furry suit was made to fit him, and his hair was shaped to a tiny point that further accented his sloping brow. Finally, he was given the name, &quot;Zip the Pinhead&quot;, the &quot;What-Is-It?,&quot; or the &quot;Man-Monkey&quot;.

==Career==

Johnson was first exhibited by Barnum when he was 18, and his career lasted longer than 60 years. He was eventually renamed &quot;Zip&quot; after &quot;Zip Coon&quot;, an archetypal character in minstrel shows. Johnson was &quot;[l]aughed at, pelted with coins, called a &#x27;cross between a nigger and a baboon.

Zip&#x27;s early performances were set against a background story. It was told to the audience that a tribe of &quot;missing links&quot; had been discovered in Africa, and that Zip was one of these. It was further explained that the &quot;wild man&quot;, the &quot;What-Is-It&quot;, subsisted on raw meat, nuts, and fruit, but was learning to eat more civilized fare such as bread and cake.

Zip would then be revealed in a cage where he could rattle the bars and screech. This act was tremendously successful for Barnum, and Zip was as big an attraction to Barnum&#x27;s American Museum as the famous Siamese twins, Chang and Eng Bunker.

In later years, Zip became more &quot;civilized&quot; in his act. He shared the stage with other anomalies, including his friends &quot;Texas Giant&quot; Jim Tarver, &quot;Tallest Man in the World&quot; Jack Earle and Koo-Koo the Bird Girl. He traveled extensively with the Ringling Brothers circus.

In 1860, he was visited at the museum by Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales; his photo was taken by Civil War photographer Mathew Brady.

Throughout this period, Zip&#x27;s best friend and manager was Captain O.K. White. White conscientiously looked after Zip&#x27;s interests. He also gave Zip one of his prized possessions, a tuxedo.

In his later years, Zip eschewed traveling in favor of performing at Coney Island. One Sunday afternoon in 1925, Zip heard a little girl cry for help. He noticed the girl waving her arms in the ocean and swam out to rescue her.

Zip caught bronchitis in early 1926, and despite the wishes of his doctor and Captain White, he continued to perform his part in the stage play &quot;Sunny&quot; at the New Amsterdam Theater. Upon the closing of the play, he returned to his home in Bound Brook, New Jersey, where he was cared for by his doctor, Captain White, and his sister. When his condition worsened, he was moved to Bellevue Hospital in New York City, where he died.

It is estimated that during his 67 years in show business, Zip entertained more than one hundred million people.

Zip the Pinhead was buried in Plot 399 of the Bound Brook Cemetery on April 28, 1926. A small gravestone bearing the inscription &quot;William H. Johnson, 1857–1926&quot; marks his resting place.

==Inspiration==
Johnson is partly the inspiration for Bill Griffith&#x27;s comics character, Zippy the Pinhead. He was featured in the &quot;Freak Show Tech&quot; episode of the History Channel series &quot;Wild West Tech&quot;. Although not the first pinhead in the American circus sideshows, his costumes and presentation led to the display of several other microcephalic people to the American public.

<text>Roberta Cleopatra Flack (February 10, 1937 – February 24, 2025) was an American singer and pianist known for her emotive, genre-blending ballads that spanned R&amp;B, jazz, folk, and pop and contributed to the birth of quiet storm. Her commercial success included the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart-topping singles &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot;, and &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;. She became the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in consecutive years.

Flack frequently collaborated with Donny Hathaway, with whom she recorded several hit duets, including &quot;Where Is the Love&quot; and &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot;. She was one of the defining voices of 1970s popular music and remained active in the industry, later finding success with duets such as &quot;Tonight, I Celebrate My Love&quot; with Peabo Bryson (1983) and &quot;Set the Night to Music&quot; with Maxi Priest (1991). Across her decades-long career, she interpreted works by songwriters such as Leonard Cohen and members of the Beatles. In 2020, Flack received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Early life and education==
Flack was born on February 10, 1937, in Black Mountain, North Carolina, to parents Laron Flack, a U.S. Veterans Administration draftsman, and Irene (née Council) Flack a high-school cook and church organist. Her family moved to Richmond, Virginia, before settling in Arlington, Virginia, when she was five years old.

Her first musical experiences were in church. She grew up in a large musical family and often provided piano accompaniment for the choir of Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church singing hymns and spirituals. She also enjoyed going to the &quot;Baptist church down the street&quot; to listen to contemporary gospel music, including songs performed by Mahalia Jackson and Sam Cooke. Her father acquired a battered old piano for her, which she learned to play sitting on her mother&#x27;s lap. and Flack took formal lessons in playing the piano when she was nine. She gravitated towards classical music and during her early teens excelled at classical piano, finishing second in a statewide competition for Black students aged 13 playing a Scarlatti sonata. In 1952 at the age of 15 she won a full music scholarship to Howard University in Washington DC, and was one of the youngest students ever to enroll there. She eventually changed her major from piano to voice and became assistant conductor of the university choir. Her direction of a production of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;Aida&quot; received a standing ovation from the Howard University faculty. At Howard she met her future collaborator, Donny Hathaway.

Flack became a student teacher at a school near Chevy Chase, Maryland. She graduated from Howard University at 19 and began graduate studies in music there, but after the sudden death of her father she had to find work to support herself. She took a job teaching music and English at a small, segregated high school in Farmville, North Carolina, for which she was paid $2,800 a year.

==Career==
===Early career===
Before becoming a professional singer-songwriter, Flack returned to Washington, D.C., and taught at Banneker, Browne, and Rabaut Junior High Schools. She also taught private piano lessons out of her home on Euclid Street, NW, in the city. During that time, her music career began to take shape on evenings and weekends in nightclubs.

At the Tivoli Theater, she accompanied opera singers at the piano. During intermissions, she would sing blues, folk, and pop standards in a back room, accompanying herself on the piano. Later she performed several nights a week at the 1520 Club, providing her own piano accompaniment. About this time her voice teacher, Frederick &quot;Wilkie&quot; Wilkerson, told her that he saw a brighter future for her in pop music than in the classics. Flack modified her repertoire accordingly and her reputation spread. In 1968, she began singing professionally when she was hired to perform regularly at Mr. Henry&#x27;s Restaurant, located on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.

===1970s===

In the 1970s, Flack sang and played jazz in a Washington, D.C. nightclub. American jazz pianist and vocalist Les McCann attended one of these sessions and later wrote in the liner notes of what would be her first album &quot;First Take&quot;: &quot;Her voice touched, tapped, trapped, and kicked every emotion I&#x27;ve ever known. I laughed, cried, and screamed for more... she alone had the voice.&quot; He arranged an audition for her with Atlantic Records, during which she played 42 songs in three hours for producer Joel Dorn. In November 1968 she recorded 39 song demos in less than 10 hours. Three months later, Atlantic reportedly recorded Flack&#x27;s debut album, &quot;First Take&quot;, in a mere 10 hours.

In 1971, Flack participated in the legendary &quot;Soul to Soul&quot; concert film by Denis Sanders which was headlined by Wilson Pickett along with Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Santana, The Staple Singers, Les McCann, Eddie Harris, The Voices of East Harlem and others. The U.S. delegation of musical artists featured in the film was invited to perform for the 14th anniversary of the March 6 Independence Day of Ghana. The film was digitally reissued on DVD and CD in 2004 but for unknown reasons Flack refused permission for her image and recording to be included . Her a cappella performance of the traditional spiritual &quot;Oh Freedom&quot;, retitled &quot;Freedom Song&quot; on the original &quot;Soul to Soul&quot; LP soundtrack, is only available in the VHS version of the film.

Flack&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; hit No. 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1972. Her Atlantic recordings did not sell particularly well, until actor/director Clint Eastwood used a song from &quot;First Take&quot;, &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, written by Ewan MacColl, for the soundtrack of his directorial debut &quot;Play Misty for Me&gt;&quot; It became the biggest hit of the year for 1972, spending six consecutive weeks at No. 1 and earning Flack a million-selling gold disc. &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; finished the year as &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s top song of 1972. The &quot;First Take&quot; album also went to No. 1 and eventually sold 1.9 million copies in the United States. Eastwood, who paid $2,000 for the use of the song in the film, remained an admirer and friend of Flack&#x27;s ever after. It was awarded the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1973. In 1983, Flack recorded the end music to the Dirty Harry film &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;, at Eastwood&#x27;s request.

In 1972, Flack began recording regularly with Donny Hathaway, scoring hits such as the Grammy-winning &quot;Where Is the Love&quot; (1972) and later &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot; (1978), both of which became million-selling gold singles. Flack and Hathaway recorded several duets together, including two LPs, until Hathaway&#x27;s death in 1979. After his death, Flack released their final LP as &quot;Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway.&quot;

On her own, Flack scored her second No. 1 hit in 1973, &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot; written by Charles Fox, Norman Gimbel l, and Lori Lieberman. &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; was awarded both Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female, at the 1974 Grammy Awards. Its parent album was Flack&#x27;s biggest-selling disc, eventually earning double platinum certification. In 1974, Flack released &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot;, which became her third and final No. 1 hit to date on the Hot 100. She produced the single and her 1975 album of the same name under the pseudonym Rubina Flake. In 1974, Flack sang the lead on a Sherman Brothers song, &quot;Freedom&quot;, which featured prominently at the opening and closing of the movie &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. In the same year, she performed &quot;When We Grow Up&quot; with a teenage Michael Jackson on the television special &quot;Free to Be... You and Me&quot;, and a year later in 1975 performed two Johnny Marks songs, &quot;To Love And Be Loved&quot; and &quot;When Autumn Comes&quot;, for the animated Christmas special &quot;The Tiny Tree&quot;.

===1980–1991===

Flack had a 1982 hit single with &quot;Making Love&quot;, written by Burt Bacharach (the title track of the 1982 film of the same name), which reached No. 13. She began working with Peabo Bryson, charting as high as No. 2 on the UK charts with &quot;Tonight, I Celebrate My Love&quot; in 1983.

In 1986, Flack sang the theme song &quot;Together Through the Years&quot; for the NBC television series &quot;Valerie&quot;, later known as &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;. The song was used throughout the show&#x27;s six seasons. In 1987, Flack supplied the voice of Michael Jackson&#x27;s mother in the 18-minute short film for &quot;Bad&quot;. &quot;Oasis&quot; was released in 1988 and failed to make an impact with pop audiences, though the title track reached No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart and a remix of &quot;Uh-Uh Ooh-Ooh Look Out (Here It Comes)&quot; topped the dance chart in 1989, after failing to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1991, Flack found herself again in the US Top 10 with a cover of the Diane Warren-penned song &quot;Set the Night to Music&quot;, performed as a duet with Maxi Priest that peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts and No. 2 AC.

===Later career===
In 1999, a star with Flack&#x27;s name was placed on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In the same year, she gave a concert tour in South Africa. During her tour of the country, she performed &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot; for President Nelson Mandela at his home in Johannesburg. In 2010, she appeared on the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, singing a duet of &quot;Where Is The Love&quot; with Maxwell.

Flack influenced the subgenre of contemporary R&amp;B called quiet storm, and interpreted songs by songwriters such as Leonard Cohen and members of the Beatles.

In February 2012, Flack released &quot;Let It Be Roberta&quot;, an album of Beatles covers including &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It was her first recording in eight years. Flack knew John Lennon and Yoko Ono, as both parties lived in The Dakota apartment building in New York City and had apartments next door to each other. Flack said that she had been asked to do a second album of Beatles covers. In 2013, she was reported to be involved in an interpretative album of the Beatles&#x27; classics.

At the age of 80, Flack recorded &quot;Running&quot; for the closing credits song of the 2018 feature documentary &quot;3100: Run and Become&quot; with music and lyrics by Michael A. Levine.

== Critical reputation ==
In 1971, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau reported that &quot;Flack is generally regarded as the most significant new black woman singer since Aretha Franklin, and at moments she sounds kind, intelligent, and very likable. But she often exhibits the gratuitous gentility you&#x27;d expect of someone who says &#x27;between you and I&#x27;.&quot; Reviewing her body of work from the 1970s, he later argued that the singer &quot;has nothing whatsoever to do with rock and roll or rhythm and blues and almost nothing to do with soul&quot;, comparing her middle-of-the-road aesthetic to Barry Manilow but with better taste, which he believed does not necessarily guarantee more enduring music: &quot;In the long run, pop lies are improved by vulgarity.&quot;

Writer and music critic Ann Powers argued in a 2020 piece for NPR that &quot;Flack&#x27;s presence looms over both R&amp;B and indie &quot;bedroom&quot; pop as if she were one of the astral beings in Ava DuVernay&#x27;s version of &quot;A Wrinkle In Time.&quot;&quot; Jason King argued that she occupied a complex place in popular music, as &quot;the nature of her power as a performer—to generate rapturous, spellbinding mood music and to plumb the depths of soulful heaviness by way of classically-informed technique—is not too easy to claim or make sense with the limited tools that we have in music criticism.&quot;

Flack&#x27;s minimalist, classically trained approach to her songs was seen by a number of critics as lacking in grit and uncharacteristic of soul music. According to music scholar Jason King, her work was regularly described with the adjectives &quot;boring&quot;, &quot;depressing&quot;, &quot;lifeless&quot;, &quot;studied&quot;, and &quot;calculated&quot;, although in contrast, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey said it had been described as &quot;classy, urbane, reserved, smooth, and sophisticated&quot;.

An obituary in February 2025 stated: &quot;She sang with flawless diction and an elegant, understated power&quot; in a voice that was &quot;soft and sensual, creating a radio-friendly crossover between jazz, R&amp;B and easy listening,&quot; and her classical training meant that she could accompany herself in any style on the piano.

==Personal life==
Flack was a member of the Artist Empowerment Coalition, which advocated for artists to have the right to control their creative properties. She was also a spokeswoman for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA); her appearance in commercials for the ASPCA featured &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;. The Hyde Leadership Charter School in the Bronx, NYC, (now called Leaders In Our Neighborhood Charter School) ran an after-school music program called &quot;The Roberta Flack School of Music&quot; to provide free music education to underprivileged students in partnership with Flack, who founded the school. Flack was also an advocate for gay rights, stating that &quot;Love is love. Between a man and a woman, between two men, between two women. Love is universal, like music.&quot;

From 1966 to 1972, she was married to Steve Novosel. Flack was the aunt of professional ice skater Rory Flack. She was also the godmother of musician Bernard Wright, who died in an accident on May 19, 2022. For 40 years, Flack had an apartment in The Dakota building in New York City that was right next door to the apartment of Yoko Ono and John Lennon, their son Sean grew up calling her &quot;Aunt Roberta&quot;. She also counted among her friends the activists Jesse Jackson and Angela Davis, as well as Maya Angelou, who co-wrote the song &quot;And So It Goes&quot; for Flack&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;Oasis&quot;.

According to DNA analysis, Flack was of Cameroonian descent.

===Illness and death===
In 2018, Flack was appearing onstage at the Apollo Theater at a benefit for the Jazz Foundation of America when she became ill, left the stage and was rushed to the Harlem Hospital Center. In a statement, her manager announced that Flack had had a stroke a few years prior and still was not feeling well, but was &quot;doing fine&quot; and was being kept overnight for medical observation.

In late 2022, it was announced by a spokesperson that Flack had been diagnosed with ALS and had retired from performing, as the disease was making it &quot;impossible to sing&quot;.

Flack died of cardiac arrest on February 24, 2025, on her way to a hospital in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.

==Accolades==
On May 11, 2017, Roberta Flack received an honorary Doctorate degree in the Arts from Long Island University. She was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2021, Flack was one of the first inductees into the Women Songwriters Hall of Fame.

On March 12, 2022, Flack was honored with the DAR Women in American History Award and a restored fire callbox in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington D.C. commemorating her early-career connection to nearby Mr. Henry&#x27;s neighborhood bar.

On January 24, 2023, the PBS series &quot;American Masters&quot; opened its 37th season with an hour-long look at her career. On May 13, 2023, Flack received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music.

<text>In rhetoric, litotes (, ), also known classically as antenantiosis or moderatour, is a figure of speech and form of irony in which understatement is used to emphasize a point by stating a negative to further affirm a positive, often incorporating double negatives for effect. A form of understatement, litotes can be in the form of meiosis, and is always deliberate with the intention of emphasis. However, the interpretation of negation may depend on context, including cultural context. In speech, litotes may also depend on intonation and emphasis; for example, the phrase &quot;not bad&quot; can be intonated differently so as to mean either &quot;mediocre&quot; or &quot;excellent&quot;. Along the same lines, litotes can be used (as a form of auxesis), to euphemistically provide emphasis by diminishing the harshness of an observation; &quot;He isn&#x27;t the cleanest person I know&quot; could be used as a means of indicating that someone is a messy person.

The use of litotes is common in English, Russian, German, Yiddish, Dutch, Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Ukrainian, Polish, Chinese, French, Czech and Slovak, and is also prevalent in a number of other languages and dialects. It is a feature of Old English poetry and of the Icelandic sagas and is a means of much stoical restraint.

The word litotes is of Greek origin (), meaning &#x27;simplicity&#x27;, and is derived from the word (), meaning &#x27;plain, simple, small or meager&#x27;.

==Classical litotes==
The first known mention of litotes is in a letter from Cicero in 55 BC (&quot;De Oratore&quot;). Cicero uses the word to mean simplicity (or frugality) of life. The meaning and the function of the word changed from &#x27;simple&#x27; to the idea of understatement that involves double negatives, a way to state things simply.

Old Norse had several types of litotes. These points are denied negatives (&quot;She&#x27;s not a terrible wife&quot; meaning &quot;she&#x27;s a good wife&quot;), denied positives (&quot;He&#x27;s not a great learner&quot; meaning &#x27;he has difficulty learning&#x27;), creating litotes without negating anything, and creating litotes using a negative adjective (&quot;Days spent in his home left him unenthused&quot; meaning &#x27;he preferred to be out and about&#x27;).

==Litotes and ethos==
Litotes can be used to establish ethos, or credibility, by expressing modesty or downplaying one&#x27;s accomplishments to gain the audience&#x27;s favor. In the book &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, litotes is addressed as a member of the Figures of Thought known as &quot;deminutio&quot;, or understatement. It is listed in conjunction with antenantiosis and meiosis, two other forms of rhetorical deminutio. For example, a very accomplished artist might say &quot;I&#x27;m not a bad painter&quot;, and by refraining from bragging but still acknowledging his skill, the artist is seen as talented, modest, and credible.

==Examples==
==Other languages==
===Classical Greek===
In Classical Greek, instances of litotes can be found as far back as Homer. In Book 24 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Zeus describes Achilles as follows: , meaning that he is both wise and prudent.

===French===
In French, (not bad) is used similarly to the English, while (&#x27;he is not disagreeable&#x27;) is another example, actually meaning (&#x27;he is nice&#x27;), though the speaker is reluctant to admit it. Another typical example is (&#x27;It&#x27;s not stupid&#x27;), generally said to admit a clever suggestion without showing oneself as too enthusiastic. (As with all litotes, this phrase can also be used with its literal meaning that the thing is not stupid but rather may be clever or occupy the middle ground between stupid and clever.)

One of the most famous litotes of French literature is in Pierre Corneille&#x27;s (1636). The heroine, Chimène, says to her lover Rodrigue, who just killed her father: (&#x27;Go, I hate you not&#x27;), meaning &#x27;I love you&#x27;.

===Chinese===
In Chinese, the phrase (Pinyin: , traditional characters , literally &#x27;not wrong&#x27;) is often used to present something as very good or correct. In this way, it is distinct in meaning from the English &#x27;not bad&#x27; (though not &#x27;not bad at all&#x27;) or the general use of the French . Also, the phrase (pinyin , traditional characters , literally &#x27;not simple&#x27;) is used to refer to an impressive feat.

===Danish===

In Danish, understatements using litotes are seen as characteristic of the Jutlandic dialect. A stereotypical example is the phrase (&#x27;it is not even so bad&#x27;), which is used to mean &#x27;that&#x27;s great&#x27;.

===Dutch and German===
Similarly, in Dutch, the phrase (also literally meaning &#x27;not bad&#x27;) is often used to present something as very good or correct, as is German .

===Italian===
In Italian, (literally &#x27;less bad&#x27;) is similar to the English expression, &#x27;So much the better&#x27; – used to comment that a situation is more desirable than its negative (cf. Winston Churchill&#x27;s comment, since transformed into a snowclone, that &quot;democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others&quot;).

===Latin===
In Latin, an example of litotes can be found in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;: (bk. 1 ln. 692, &#x27;not one occasion&#x27;), meaning &#x27;on more than one occasion&#x27;. Some common words are derived from litotes: from (&#x27;not none&#x27;) is understood to mean &#x27;several&#x27;, while from (&#x27;not never&#x27;) is used for &#x27;sometimes&#x27;.

===Russian===

Perhaps the most common litote in Russian is (&#x27;not bad&#x27;). Somewhat unusually, it is permissible to say something is (&#x27;very not bad&#x27;) to signify that it is, in fact, very good. An example of litotes can be found in Nikolai Gogol&#x27;s &quot;The Government Inspector&quot;, in which the Mayor says: &quot;There&#x27;s no such thing as a man with no sins on his conscience&quot;, meaning &#x27;All men have sins on their conscience&#x27; (Act 1, Scene 1). In this case, it is used to downplay the Mayor&#x27;s statement – a euphemism of sorts – making it less harsh than its understood meaning.

===Spanish===
In Spanish, it is usual to say (&#x27;It&#x27;s not at all foolish&#x27;), as a form of compliment (i.e., to say something was smart or clever). Another common Spanish phrase is (cf. Italian above), meaning literally &#x27;less bad&#x27;, but used in the same way as the English phrases &quot;Thank goodness!&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s just as well&quot;.

===Swedish===
In Swedish, it is quite common to use litotes. For example, when one chances to meet someone after a long time it is usual to say: (&#x27;It wasn&#x27;t yesterday&#x27;).

===Turkish===
In Turkish, it is quite common to say (&#x27;Not bad at all!&#x27;) as a form of compliment.

===Welsh===
In Welsh, (&#x27;To be disappointed on the best side&#x27;) means &#x27;to be pleasantly surprised&#x27;.

<doc id="177231" wikidata="Q2677000" url="?curid=177231" title="River Test">
<text>The River Test is a chalk stream in Hampshire in the south of England. It rises at Ashe near Basingstoke and flows southwards for to Southampton Water. Settlements on the Test include the towns of Stockbridge and Romsey. The river&#x27;s valley gives its name to the local government district of Test Valley. Below the village of Longparish, the river is broadly followed by the Test Way, a long-distance footpath.

Much of the Test is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is part of the Solent and Southampton Water Ramsar site and Special Protection Area. The river is used for fly fishing for trout from its source to its tidal limit.

==Etymology==
Recorded forms are Terstan from 877 and 901, Tarstan stream in 1045, Terstein 1234, and Test in 1425. If Common Brittonic, not Old English, all related dictionaries show three suitable words beginning with Tre- and none with extremely rare Ter-. There is precedent to such metathesis: as for the river Tern in the far west, from tren &#x27;strong&#x27;. If so it most likely relates to the Welsh &quot;tres&quot; (tumult, commotion, contention, uproar) or &quot;trais&quot; (force, might in older Welsh). A close set of words (diversely conjugated and pronounced) in Old English is (f)irst(en), the meaning of which is as at present, first.

==Course==

The river rises near the village of Ashe, to the west of Basingstoke (at ), and flows west through the villages of Overton, Laverstoke, and the town of Whitchurch, before joining with the Bourne Rivulet at Testbourne and turning in a more southerly direction. It then proceeds through the villages of Longparish and Middleton to Wherwell and Chilbolton, where the Rivers Dever and Anton join.

From Chilbolton the river goes through the villages of Leckford, Longstock, Stockbridge and Houghton to Mottisfont and Kimbridge, where the River Dun joins the flow. From here the village of Timsbury is passed, then through the grounds of Roke Manor before reaching the town of Romsey. On the western edge of Romsey, Sadler&#x27;s Mill, an 18th-century watermill, sits astride the River Test.

South of Romsey, the river passes the country house of Broadlands, and then Nursling, once the site of a Roman bridge. Finally the river is joined by the River Blackwater and soon becomes tidal, widening out into a considerable estuary that is lined on its northern bank by the container terminals and quays of the Port of Southampton. The Test estuary then meets that of the River Itchen and the two continue to the sea as Southampton Water.

Between Chilbolton and Redbridge, the river was once paralleled by the Andover Canal, which was itself converted to a railway in 1865, and then in turn abandoned. Most traces of the canal have disappeared, although the remains of a stretch can still be seen between Timsbury and Romsey.

==Ecology==
This chalk stream has one of the richest fauna and flora of any lowland river in England. More than 100 species of flowering plant have been recorded along its banks and 232 invertebrate taxa in the river. It is also important for wetland birds, with breeding species including kingfishers, grey wagtails and little grebes.

===Water quality===
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

Water quality of the River Test in 2019:
==In popular culture==
The river features in Richard Adams&#x27; 1972 novel &quot;Watership Down&quot;. When the Watership rabbits are pursued by an enemy force, one rabbit carries out a plan which leads to their successful escape down the Test on a punt. In the text, readers are told that this plan would not have been possible on most rivers, but the Test&#x27;s smooth-flowing, weed-free nature makes it an exception. The punt becomes lodged on a low bridge, and the surviving rabbits are forced to swim under the bridge to the riverbank.

==Tributaries==

The following are the named tributaries of the River Test, listed in order upstream from Southampton Water.
* Tanners Brook
* Wimpson stream (historically; due to the extension of the docks it now merges with Tanners Brook just before it reaches the Test)
* River Blackwater
* River Dun
* Wallop Brook
* River Anton
** Pillhill Brook
* River Dever
* Bourne Rivulet
** River Swift

<doc id="177232" wikidata="Q1470329" url="?curid=177232" title="Victor Talking Machine Company">
<text>The Victor Talking Machine Company was an American recording company and phonograph manufacturer, incorporated in 1901. Victor was an independent enterprise until 1929 when it was purchased by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and became the RCA Victor Division of the Radio Corporation of America until late 1968, when it was renamed RCA Records.

Established in Camden, New Jersey, Victor was the largest and most prestigious firm of its kind in the world, best known for its use of the iconic &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark, the design, production and marketing of the popular &quot;Victrola&quot; line of phonographs and the company&#x27;s extensive catalog of operatic and classical music recordings by world famous artists on the prestigious Red Seal label. After Victor merged with RCA in 1929, the company maintained its eminence as America&#x27;s foremost producer of records and phonographs until the 1960s.

== History ==
In 1896, Emile Berliner, the inventor of the gramophone and disc record, contracted machinist Eldridge R. Johnson to manufacture his inventions.

=== Name ===
There are different accounts as to how the &quot;Victor&quot; name came about. RCA historian Fred Barnum gives various possible origins of the name in &quot;&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; In America&quot;, he writes, &quot;One story claims that Johnson considered his first improved Gramophone to be both a scientific and business &#x27;victory.&#x27; A second account is that Johnson emerged as the &#x27;Victor&#x27; from the lengthy and costly patent litigations involving Berliner and Frank Seaman&#x27;s Zonophone. A third story is that Johnson&#x27;s partner, Leon Douglass, derived the word from his wife&#x27;s name &#x27;Victoria.&#x27; Finally, a fourth story is that Johnson took the name from the popular &#x27;Victor&#x27; bicycle, which he had admired for its superior engineering. Of these four accounts, the first two are the most generally accepted.&quot; The first use of the Victor name was on a letterhead, dated March 28, 1901.

==== Marketing ====

Herbert Rose Barraud&#x27;s deceased brother, a London photographer, willed him his estate, including his DC-powered Edison-Bell cylinder phonograph with a case of cylinders and his dog, named Nipper. Barraud&#x27;s original painting depicts Nipper staring intently into the horn of an Edison-Bell while both sit on a polished wooden surface. The horn on the Edison-Bell machine was black and after a failed attempt at selling the painting to a cylinder record supplier of Edison Phonographs in the UK, a friend of Barraud&#x27;s suggested that the painting could be brightened up (and possibly made more marketable) by substituting one of the brass-belled horns on display in the window at the new gramophone shop on Maiden Lane. The Gramophone Company in London was founded and managed by an American, William Barry Owen. Barraud paid a visit with a photograph of the painting and asked to borrow a horn. Owen gave Barraud an entire gramophone and asked him to paint it into the picture, offering to buy the result. On close inspection of the painting, the contours of the Edison-Bell phonograph are visible beneath the paint of the gramophone.

In 1915, the &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; logo was rendered in immense circular leaded-glass windows in the tower of the Victrola cabinet building at Victor&#x27;s headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. The building still stands today with replica windows installed during RCA&#x27;s ownership of the plant in its later years. Today, one of the original windows is located at the Smithsonian museum in Washington, D.C.

=== Acoustical recording era (1901–1925) ===

In the company&#x27;s early years, Victor issued recordings on the Victor, Monarch and De Luxe labels, with the Victor label on 7-inch records, Monarch on 10-inch records and De Luxe on 12-inch records. De Luxe Special 14-inch records were briefly marketed in 1903–1904. In 1905, all labels and sizes were consolidated into the Victor imprint.
Victor recorded the first jazz and blues records ever issued. The Victor Military Band recorded the first recorded blues song, &quot;The Memphis Blues&quot;, on July 15, 1914, in Camden, New Jersey. In 1917, The Original Dixieland Jazz Band recorded &quot;Livery Stable Blues&quot;.

=== Electrical recording era (1925–present) ===

In the early 1920s, the advent of radio as a home entertainment medium presented Victor and the entire record industry with new challenges. Not only was music becoming available over the air free of charge, but live radio broadcasts using high-quality microphones and heard over amplified receivers provided sound that was startlingly more clear and realistic than any contemporary phonograph record. Eldridge Johnson and Victor&#x27;s senior executives were initially dismissive of the encroachments of radio, but after plummeting sales and their apathy and resistance of radio and electrical recording brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy in 1925, Victor switched from the acoustical or mechanical method of recording to the new microphone-based electrical system developed by Western Electric. Victor called its version of the improved fidelity recording process &quot;Orthophonic&quot;, and marketed a new line of phonographs referred to as &quot;Orthophonic Victrolas&quot;, scientifically developed by Western Electric to play these new records. Victor&#x27;s first electrical recordings, issued in the spring of 1925 were not advertised as such; in order to create an extensive catalog of records made by the new process to satisfy anticipated demand, and to allow dealers time to liquidate their stocks of old-style Victrolas, Victor and its longtime rival, Columbia Records, agreed to keep electrical recording secret until the autumn of 1925. Then, with the company&#x27;s largest advertising campaign to date, Victor publicly announced the new technology and introduced its new records and the Orthophonic Victrola on November 2, 1925, dubbed &quot;Victor Day&quot;.
Victor&#x27;s first commercial electrical recording was made at the company&#x27;s Camden, New Jersey studios on February 26, 1925. A group of eight popular Victor artists, Billy Murray, Frank Banta, Henry Burr, Albert Campbell, Frank Croxton, John Meyer, Monroe Silver, and Rudy Wiedoeft gathered to record &quot;A Miniature Concert&quot;. Several takes were recorded by the old acoustical process, then additional takes were recorded electrically for test purposes. The electrical recordings turned out well, and Victor issued the results that summer as the two sides of twelve inch 78 rpm disc, Victor 35753. Victor&#x27;s first electrical recording to be &quot;issued&quot; was Victor 19626, a ten-inch record consisting of two numbers recorded on March 16, 1925, from the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s thirty-seventh annual production of the Mask and Wig Club, released in April, 1925. On March 21, 1925, Victor recorded its first electrical Red Seal disc, twelve inch 6502 by French pianist Alfred Cortot, of works by Chopin and Schubert.

=== Post-acquisition (1929–present) ===
In 1926, Johnson sold his controlling (but not holding) interest in the Victor Company to the banking firms of JW Seligman and Speyer &amp; Co., who in turn sold Victor to the Radio Corporation of America in 1929.

The Discography of American Historical Recordings (DAHR) is a continuation of the Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings (EDVR) project by Ted Fagan and William Moran to make a complete discography of all Victor recordings as well as adding the recordings of Columbia, Brunswick and other historic American labels now controlled by Sony Music Entertainment. The Victor archive files are the main source of information for this project.

In 2011, the Library of Congress and Victor catalog owner Sony Music Entertainment launched the National Jukebox offering streaming audio of more than 10,000 pre-1925 recorded works for listening by the general public; the majority of these recordings have not been widely available for over 100 years.
