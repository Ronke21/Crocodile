<text>The Indigenous languages of the Americas are the languages that were used by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas before the arrival of non-Indigenous peoples. Over a thousand of these languages are still used today, while many more are now extinct. The Indigenous languages of the Americas are not all related to each other; instead, they are classified into a hundred or so language families and isolates, as well as several extinct languages that are unclassified due to the lack of information on them.

Many proposals have been made to relate some or all of these languages to each other, with varying degrees of success. The most widely reported is Joseph Greenberg&#x27;s Amerind hypothesis, which, however, nearly all specialists reject because of severe methodological flaws; spurious data; and a failure to distinguish cognation, contact, and coincidence.

According to UNESCO, most of the Indigenous languages of the Americas are critically endangered, and many are dormant (without native speakers but with a community of heritage-language users) or entirely extinct. The most widely spoken Indigenous languages are Southern Quechua (spoken primarily in southern Peru and Bolivia) and Guarani (centered in Paraguay, where it shares national language status with Spanish), with perhaps six or seven million speakers apiece (including many of European descent in the case of Guarani). Only half a dozen others have more than a million speakers; these are Aymara of Bolivia and Nahuatl of Mexico, with almost two million each; the Mayan languages Kekchi, Quiché, and Yucatec of Guatemala and Mexico, with about 1 million apiece; and perhaps one or two additional Quechuan languages in Peru and Ecuador. In the United States, 372,000 people reported speaking an Indigenous language at home in the 2010 census. In Canada, 133,000 people reported speaking an Indigenous language at home in the 2011 census. In Greenland, about 90% of the population speaks Greenlandic, the most widely spoken Eskaleut language.

==Background==
Over a thousand known languages were spoken by various peoples in North and South America prior to their first contact with Europeans. These encounters occurred between the beginning of the 11th century (with the Nordic settlement of Greenland and failed efforts in Newfoundland and Labrador) and the end of the 15th century (the voyages of Christopher Columbus). Several Indigenous cultures of the Americas had also developed their own writing systems, the best known being the Maya script. The Indigenous languages of the Americas had widely varying demographics, from the Quechuan languages, Aymara, Guarani, and Nahuatl, which had millions of active speakers, to many languages with only several hundred speakers. After pre-Columbian times, several Indigenous creole languages developed in the Americas, based on European, Indigenous and African languages.

The European colonizing nations and their successor states had widely varying attitudes towards Native American languages. In Brazil, friars learned and promoted the Tupi language. In many Spanish colonies, Spanish missionaries often learned local languages and culture in order to preach to the natives in their own tongue and relate the Christian message to their Indigenous religions. In the British American colonies, John Eliot of the Massachusetts Bay Colony translated the Bible into the Massachusett language, also called Wampanoag, or Natick (1661–1663); he published the first Bible printed in North America, the &quot;Eliot Indian Bible&quot;.

The Europeans also suppressed use of Indigenous languages, establishing their own languages for official communications, destroying texts in other languages, and insisted that Indigenous people learn European languages in schools. As a result, Indigenous languages suffered from cultural suppression and loss of speakers. By the 18th and 19th centuries, Spanish, English, Portuguese, French, and Dutch, brought to the Americas by European settlers and administrators, had become the official or national languages of modern nation-states of the Americas.

Many Indigenous languages have become critically endangered, but others are vigorous and part of daily life for millions of people. Several Indigenous languages have been given official status in the countries where they occur, such as Guaraní in Paraguay. In other cases official status is limited to certain regions where the languages are most spoken. Although sometimes enshrined in constitutions as official, the languages may be used infrequently in &quot;de facto&quot; official use. Examples are Quechua in Peru and Aymara in Bolivia, where in practice, Spanish is dominant in all formal contexts.

In the North American Arctic region, Greenland in 2009 elected Kalaallisut as its sole official language. In the United States, the Navajo language is the most spoken Native American language, with more than 200,000 speakers in the Southwestern United States. The US Marine Corps recruited Navajo men, who were established as code talkers during World War II.

==Origins==

In &quot;American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America&quot; (1997), Lyle Campbell lists several hypotheses for the historical origins of Amerindian languages.

* A single, one-language migration (not widely accepted)
* A few linguistically distinct migrations (favored by Edward Sapir)
* Multiple migrations
* Multilingual migrations (single migration with multiple languages)
* The influx of already diversified but related languages from the Old World
* Extinction of Old World linguistic relatives (while the New World ones survived)
* Migration along the Pacific coast instead of by the Bering Strait

Roger Blench (2008) has advocated the theory of multiple migrations along the Pacific coast of peoples from northeastern Asia, who already spoke diverse languages. These proliferated in the New World.

==Numbers of speakers and political recognition==
Countries like Mexico, Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala, and Guyana recognize most Indigenous languages. Bolivia and Venezuela give all Indigenous languages official status. Canada, Argentina, and the U.S. allow provinces and states to decide. Brazil limits recognition to localities.

* Bolivia: Official status for all Indigenous languages.
* Venezuela: Official status for all Indigenous languages.
* Mexico: Recognizes all Indigenous languages.
* Guatemala: Recognizes all Indigenous languages.
* Guyana: Recognizes most Indigenous languages.
* Colombia: Local recognition at the department level.
* Canada: Bill C-91 Indigenous Languages Act and Indigenous languages recognition in Parliament.
* Argentina: Provincial determination of language policies.
* United States: State determination of language policies.
* Brazil: Local recognition of Indigenous languages.

Canada

Bill C-91, passed in 2019, supports Indigenous languages through sustainable funding and the Office of the Commissioner of Indigenous Languages. The first Commissioner of Indigenous languages in Canada is Ronald E. Ignace. 

Colombia

Colombia delegates local Indigenous language recognition to the department level according to the Colombian Constitution of 1991.

* Bullet points represent minority language status. Political entities with official language status are highlighted in bold.

==Language families and unclassified languages==
Notes:
* Extinct languages or families are indicated by: &quot;†&quot;.
* The number of family members is indicated in parentheses (for example, Arauan (9) means the Arauan family consists of nine languages).
* For convenience, the following list of language families is divided into three sections based on political boundaries of countries. These sections correspond roughly with the geographic regions (North, Central, and South America) but are not equivalent. This division cannot fully delineate Indigenous culture areas.

===Northern America===

There are approximately 296 spoken (or formerly spoken) Indigenous languages north of Mexico, 269 of which are grouped into 29 families (the remaining 27 languages are either isolates or unclassified). The Na-Dené, Algic, and Uto-Aztecan families are the largest in terms of number of languages. Uto-Aztecan has the most speakers (1.95 million) if the languages in Mexico are considered (mostly due to 1.5 million speakers of Nahuatl); Na-Dené comes in second with approximately 200,000 speakers (nearly 180,000 of these are speakers of Navajo), and Algic in third with about 180,000 speakers (mainly Cree and Ojibwe). Na-Dené and Algic have the widest geographic distributions: Algic currently spans from northeastern Canada across much of the continent down to northeastern Mexico (due to later migrations of the Kickapoo) with two outliers in California (Yurok and Wiyot); Na-Dené spans from Alaska and western Canada through Washington, Oregon, and California to the U.S. Southwest and northern Mexico (with one outlier in the Plains). Several families consist of only 2 or 3 languages. Demonstrating genetic relationships has proved difficult due to the great linguistic diversity present in North America. Two large (super-) family proposals, Penutian and Hokan, look particularly promising. However, even after decades of research, a large number of families remain.

North America is notable for its linguistic diversity, especially in California. This area has 18 language families comprising 74 languages (compared to five families in Europe: Indo-European, Uralic, Turkic, Kartvelian, and Afroasiatic and one isolate, Basque).

Another area of considerable diversity appears to have been the Southeastern Woodlands; however, many of these languages became extinct from European contact and as a result they are, for the most part, absent from the historical record. This diversity has influenced the development of linguistic theories and practice in the US.

Due to the diversity of languages in North America, it is difficult to make generalizations for the region. Most North American languages have a relatively small number of vowels (i.e. three to five vowels). Languages of the western half of North America often have relatively large consonant inventories. The languages of the Pacific Northwest are notable for their complex phonotactics (for example, some languages have words that lack vowels entirely). The languages of the Plateau area have relatively rare pharyngeals and epiglottals (they are otherwise restricted to Afroasiatic languages and the languages of the Caucasus). Ejective consonants are also common in western North America, although they are rare elsewhere (except, again, for the Caucasus region, parts of Africa, and the Mayan family).

Head-marking is found in many languages of North America (as well as in Central and South America), but outside of the Americas it is rare. Many languages throughout North America are polysynthetic (Eskaleut languages are extreme examples), although this is not characteristic of all North American languages (contrary to what was believed by 19th-century linguists). Several families have unique traits, such as the inverse number marking of the Tanoan languages, the lexical affixes of the Wakashan, Salishan and Chimakuan languages, and the unusual verb structure of Na-Dené.

The classification below is a composite of Goddard (1996), Campbell (1997), and Mithun (1999).

===Central America and Mexico===


In Central America the Mayan languages are among those used today. Mayan languages are spoken by at least six million Indigenous Maya, primarily in Guatemala, Mexico, Belize and Honduras. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico recognizes eight more. The Mayan language family is one of the best documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages descend from Proto-Mayan, a language thought to have been spoken at least 4,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method.

=== South America and the Caribbean ===


Although both North and Central America are very diverse areas, South America has a linguistic diversity rivalled by only a few other places in the world with approximately 350 languages still spoken and several hundred more spoken at first contact but now extinct. The situation of language documentation and classification into genetic families is not as advanced as in North America (which is relatively well studied in many areas). Kaufman (1994: 46) gives the following appraisal:
Since the mid 1950s, the amount of published material on SA [South America] has been gradually growing, but even so, the number of researchers is far smaller than the growing number of linguistic communities whose speech should be documented. Given the current employment opportunities, it is not likely that the number of specialists in SA Indian languages will increase fast enough to document most of the surviving SA languages before they go out of use, as most of them unavoidably will. More work languishes in personal files than is published, but this is a standard problem.

It is fair to say that SA and New Guinea are linguistically the poorest documented parts of the world. However, in the early 1960s fairly systematic efforts were launched in Papua New Guinea, and that areamuch smaller than SA, to be sureis in general much better documented than any part of Indigenous SA of comparable size.
As a result, many relationships between languages and language families have not been determined and some of those relationships that have been proposed are on somewhat shaky ground.

The list of language families, isolates, and unclassified languages below is a rather conservative one based on Campbell (1997). Many of the proposed (and often speculative) groupings of families can be seen in Campbell (1997), Gordon (2005), Kaufman (1990, 1994), Key (1979), Loukotka (1968), and in the Language stock proposals section below.

==Language stock proposals==

Hypothetical language-family proposals of American languages are often cited as uncontroversial in popular writing. However, many of these proposals have not been fully demonstrated, or even demonstrated at all. Some proposals are viewed by specialists in a favorable light, believing that genetic relationships are very likely to be established in the future (for example, the Penutian stock). Other proposals are more controversial with many linguists believing that some genetic relationships of a proposal may be demonstrated but much of it undemonstrated (for example, Hokan–Siouan, which, incidentally, Edward Sapir called his &quot;wastepaper basket stock&quot;). Still other proposals are almost unanimously rejected by specialists (for example, Amerind). Below is a (partial) list of some such proposals:
* Algonquian–Wakashan   
* Almosan–Keresiouan   
* Amerind   
* Algonkian–Gulf   
* (macro-)Arawakan
* Arutani–Sape

* Totozoque   
* Tunican   
* Yok–Utian
* Yuki–Wappo
Good discussions of past proposals can be found in Campbell (1997) and Campbell &amp; Mithun (1979).

Amerindian linguist Lyle Campbell also assigned different percentage values of probability and confidence for various proposals of macro-families and language relationships, depending on his views of the proposals&#x27; strengths. For example, the Germanic language family would receive probability and confidence percentage values of +100% and 100%, respectively. However, if Turkish and Quechua were compared, the probability value might be −95%, while the confidence value might be 95%. 0% probability or confidence would mean complete uncertainty.

== Pronouns ==

It has long been observed that a remarkable number of Native American languages have a pronominal pattern with first-person singular forms in &quot;n&quot; and second-person singular forms in &quot;m&quot;. (Compare first-person singular &quot;m&quot; and second-person singular &quot;t&quot; across much of northern Eurasia, as in English &quot;me&quot; and &quot;thee&quot;, Spanish &quot;me&quot; and &quot;te&quot;, and Hungarian &quot;-m&quot; and &quot;-d&quot;.) This pattern was first noted by Alfredo Trombetti in 1905. It caused Sapir to suggest that ultimately all Native American languages would turn out to be related. Johanna Nichols suggests that the pattern had spread through diffusion. This notion was rejected by Lyle Campbell, who argued that the frequency of the n/m pattern was not statistically elevated in either area compared to the rest of the world. Zamponi found that Nichols&#x27;s findings were distorted by her small sample size. Looking at families rather than individual languages, he found a rate of 30% of families/protolanguages in North America, all on the western flank, compared to 5% in South America and 7% of non-American languages – though the percentage in North America, and especially the even higher number in the Pacific Northwest, drops considerably if Hokan and Penutian, or parts of them, are accepted as language families. If all the proposed Penutian and Hokan languages in the table below are related, then the frequency drops to 9% of North American families, statistically indistinguishable from the world average.

==Linguistic areas==
==Unattested languages==
Several languages are only known by mention in historical documents or from only a few names or words. It cannot be determined that these languages actually existed or that the few recorded words are actually of known or unknown languages. Some may simply be from a historian&#x27;s errors. Others are of known people with no linguistic record (sometimes due to lost records). A short list is below.
* Ais
* Akokisa
* Aranama
* Ausaima
* Avoyel
* Bayagoula
* Bidai
* Cacán (Diaguita–Calchaquí)
* Calusa – Mayaimi – Tequesta
* Cusabo
* Eyeish
* Grigra
* Guale
* Houma
* Koroa
* Mayaca (possibly related to Ais)
* Mobila
* Okelousa
* Opelousa
* Pascagoula
* Pensacola – Amacano - Chacato - Chine (Muscogean languages)
* Pijao language
* Pisabo (possibly the same language as Matsés)
* Quinipissa
* Taensa
* Tiou
* Yamacraw
* Yamasee
* Yazoo
Loukotka (1968) reports the names of hundreds of South American languages which do not have any linguistic documentation.

While most Indigenous languages have adopted the Latin script as the written form of their languages, a few languages have their own unique writing systems after encountering the Latin script (often through missionaries) that are still in use. All pre-Columbian Indigenous writing systems are no longer used.

<text>Roger Meddows Taylor (born 26 July 1949) is an English musician, songwriter and record producer. He achieved international fame as the drummer and backing vocalist for the rock band Queen. As a drummer, Taylor was recognised early in his career for his unique sound and was voted the eighth-greatest drummer in classic rock music history in a listener poll conducted by Planet Rock in 2005. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 as a member of Queen.

As a songwriter, Taylor composed at least one track on every Queen album, and often sang lead vocals on his own compositions. He wrote or co-wrote three UK number ones (&quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;Innuendo&quot; and &quot;Under Pressure&quot;) and wrote a further five major hits (&quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, &quot;A Kind of Magic&quot;, &quot;Heaven for Everyone&quot;, &quot;Breakthru&quot; and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;). He has collaborated with such artists as Eric Clapton, Roger Waters, Roger Daltrey, Robert Plant, Phil Collins, Genesis, Jimmy Nail, Kansas, Elton John, Gary Numan, Shakin&#x27; Stevens, Foo Fighters, Al Stewart, Steve Vai, Yoshiki, Cyndi Almouzni and Bon Jovi. As a producer, he has produced albums by Virginia Wolf, Jimmy Nail and Magnum.

As a singer, Taylor employs a falsetto vocal range. During the 1980s, in addition to his work with Queen, he formed a parallel band known as the Cross, in which he was the lead singer and rhythm guitarist. During the early 1980s, Taylor was also a panellist on the UK quiz show &quot;Pop Quiz&quot;, hosted by Mike Read. In 2014, he appeared in &quot;Brian Pern&quot; as himself.

== Early life ==
Roger Meddows Taylor was born on 26 July 1949 at West Norfolk and Lynn Hospital in King&#x27;s Lynn, Norfolk. The new maternity ward was opened by Princess Elizabeth, the future queen, Elizabeth II. During her visit she was introduced to 16 new mothers including Winifred Taylor, his mother. Taylor first lived at 87 High Street in King&#x27;s Lynn and later moved to Beulah Street in the town. Taylor&#x27;s first school was Rosebery Avenue school. Taylor moved to Truro, Cornwall, in south west England, with his mother Winifred, father Michael and younger sister Clare. When he was seven years old, he and some friends formed his first band, the Bubblingover Boys, in which he played the ukulele. He briefly attended Truro Cathedral School; at the age of 13, he joined Truro School as a day boy. 

At the age of 15, Taylor became a member of the Reaction, a semi-professional rock band formed mainly of boys from Truro School. Taylor had originally learned guitar, but became a drummer when he realised he had a more natural aptitude for it. Taylor taught himself to tune his drums, inspired by Keith Moon of the Who because of the &quot;great drum sounds&quot; on the early Who records. Another key influence on Taylor was Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, who Taylor stated was his early role model.

In 1967, Taylor went to London to study dentistry at the London Hospital Medical College, but he became bored with it and changed to biology obtaining a BSc at East London Polytechnic.

== Career ==

=== 1968–1970: Smile ===
Taylor met Brian May and Tim Staffell in 1968 after a friend saw an advert for a drummer on a noticeboard at Imperial College. Smile included May on lead guitar, Staffell on lead vocals and bass, and later Taylor on drums. The band lasted for two years before Staffell departed to join Humpy Bong, leaving the band with a catalogue of nine songs.

Smile reunited for several songs on 22 December 1992. Taylor&#x27;s band the Cross were headliners and he brought May and Staffell on to play &quot;Earth&quot; and &quot;If I Were a Carpenter&quot;.

=== 1970s–present: Queen ===

In 1969, Taylor was working with Freddie Mercury at Kensington Market in London (they were sharing a flat at around the same time). Mercury, then known as Farrokh &quot;Freddie&quot; Bulsara, was a fan of Smile. The band split up in 1970. In the same year, Taylor turned down the chance to become drummer for Genesis, which led to Phil Collins joining instead.
 Bulsara convinced the remaining two members of Smile to continue and he eventually joined the band, which he renamed Queen. In 1971, they recruited bassist John Deacon, before going on to release their self-titled debut album in 1973. Taylor is the third most credited songwriter for the band, usually contributing one or two tracks per album.

===1977–present: Solo career===
Taylor has had a productive solo career, releasing six albums. His first single was &quot;I Wanna Testify&quot; in 1977, recorded during Queen&#x27;s sessions for the &quot;News of the World&quot; album. The A-side, although a cover of the Parliaments song of the same name, was completely different from the original. The B-side was a self-penned song &quot;Turn on the TV&quot;.
Taylor&#x27;s first solo album, released in 1981, was &quot;Fun in Space&quot;, on which he performed all vocals and played all instruments aside from about half of the keyboards, which were contributed by engineer David Richards. With Queen still touring heavily and recording at the time of release, Taylor was unable to promote the album to its fullest extent, only appearing on some European TV shows to promote the single, &quot;Future Management&quot;, including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. A second single from the album was titled &quot;My Country&quot;. The only US single released from the album was &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Crazy&quot;.

Taylor&#x27;s next solo venture, &quot;Strange Frontier&quot;, came in June 1984. The three singles from the album were the title track, &quot;Beautiful Dreams&quot; (in Portugal only) and &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, the latter becoming a live favourite for him in later years. No attempts to promote the singles were made since Queen was touring to promote &quot;The Works&quot;, with Taylor not even performing on any TV shows. &quot;Strange Frontier&quot; included guest appearances by bandmates Freddie Mercury, Brian May and John Deacon. Mercury sang backing vocals on &quot;Killing Time&quot;, Deacon remixed the B-side &quot;I Cry For You&quot; and Rick Parfitt co-wrote and played on &quot;It&#x27;s An Illusion&quot;. David Richards, Queen&#x27;s engineer and producer at the time, also co-wrote two of the tracks. The album includes covers of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Racing in the Street&quot; and Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Masters of War&quot;.
In 1986, Taylor co-produced &quot;Vigilante&quot;, the sixth studio album by rock band Magnum. After Queen finished their 1986 Magic Tour, Taylor started a new band, the Cross, which released three albums over their six years of existence. In 1993, the band split up, after performing one final gig at the Gosport Festival.

In 1994, Taylor worked with Yoshiki, drummer and pianist of X Japan and released the song &quot;Foreign Sand&quot; and a reworking of the Cross&#x27;s &quot;Final Destination&quot;. The album &quot;Happiness?&quot; was &quot;Dedicated to the tasmanian tiger – thylacinus cynocephalus, but most especially... for Freddie&quot;. &quot;Nazis 1994&quot; from this album became Taylor&#x27;s first hit single in England and was followed by two other top 40 UK hits, &quot;Happiness&quot; and &quot;Foreign Sand&quot;.

In 1998, Taylor released his fourth solo album &quot;Electric Fire&quot;. Taylor also performed one of the first Internet-gigs – for which he got a mention in the Guinness Book of World Records. On 11 November 2013, Taylor released the album &quot;Fun on Earth&quot;, On the same day, Taylor released his compilation album &quot;The Lot&quot;, which includes all of his work outside of Queen.

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Taylor released a new single &quot;Isolation&quot; on 21 June 2020. The song debuted on the top of the UK iTunes Rock chart. On 7 May 2021, Taylor announced his new solo album, &quot;Outsider&quot;, which was released on 1 October 2021, and debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart.

===1987–1993: The Cross===
The Cross were a side project of Taylor&#x27;s that existed from 1987 to 1993 and released three albums. While still the drummer for Queen, Taylor fronted the Cross as rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist. On its debut release, &quot;The Cross&quot; incorporated dance influences which they dropped on their remaining two albums.

===2001–2011===
Taylor has appeared along with May for various other events and promotions, including Queen&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 and the &quot;Party at the Palace&quot; in 2002, celebrating the golden jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. In 2004, Taylor, May, and Mike Dixon received the Helpmann Award in Australia for Best Music Direction for the musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;. At the Live Earth concert held at Wembley Stadium in 2007, Taylor opened the show with Taylor Hawkins of Foo Fighters and Chad Smith of Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Taylor and May, performing as Queen, also appeared three times on the American singing contest television show &quot;American Idol&quot;. The first appearance was on 11 April 2006, during which that week&#x27;s contestants were required to sing a Queen song. Songs performed included &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;, &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, and &quot;Innuendo&quot;. The second time Queen appeared was on the show&#x27;s season 8 finale in May 2009, performing &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; with finalists Adam Lambert and Kris Allen. The third appearance was during the eleventh season on 25 and 26 April 2012, performing a Queen medley with the six finalists on the first show. The following day, they performed &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; with the Queen Extravaganza band.
In November 2009, Taylor appeared on the reality TV show &quot;The X Factor&quot; with May as Queen mentoring the contestants and performing &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. That month Taylor confirmed he was planning to tour with Taylor Hawkins, which Taylor described as a &quot;quick tour&quot;. At the 2011 MTV Europe Music Awards on 6 November, Queen received the Global Icon Award, and Taylor and May closed the awards ceremony, with Adam Lambert on vocals, performing &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;, &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;. In 2011, Taylor, along with Steven Tyler and Roger Daltrey, joined the advisory board of Edge Music Network. Taylor performed in the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London on 12 August.

===2013–present===
In 2013 and 2014, Taylor served as an executive producer of the film &quot;Solitary&quot;, directed by Sasha Krane. In addition to those duties, he provided original music, including the song &quot;When We Were Young&quot; and three instrumental songs which serve as incidental/background music in the film and during the closing credits. Taylor also appeared as a special guest for Welsh Rock artist Jayce Lewis providing drums for the track &quot;Wrath&quot; which were recorded at Taylor&#x27;s personal studio in Surrey, the song was released as a single from the Welshman&#x27;s album &quot;Nemesis&quot;. On 15 November 2014, Taylor joined the charity group Band Aid 30, playing drums alongside current British and Irish pop acts on the latest version of the track &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.

On 5 and 6 September 2015, Taylor, along with Led Zeppelin&#x27;s John Paul Jones, joined Foo Fighters on stage in Milton Keynes to perform a cover of the Queen and David Bowie song &quot;Under Pressure&quot;. Taylor released a new single called &quot;Gangsters Are Running This World&quot; on 1 April 2019, and on 8 April released a more rocking version of this song called &quot;Gangsters Are Running This World-Purple Version&quot;. Both versions became available for streaming on 8 April 2019. On 10 May 2019 he and Czech Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Čech released a song called &quot;That&#x27;s Football&quot; which Čech wrote for his retiring football career.

In October 2021, Taylor embarked on a 14-date solo tour (Outsider Tour) in the UK, from 2 to 22 October. In January 2023, Queen single &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; was sampled on singer Che Lingo&#x27;s single &quot;My Radio&quot;; Taylor and Queen were credited as co-lead artists on the song. In November 2023, Taylor&#x27;s bar The Wild, a collaboration with his wife Sarina Taylor, Adam Lambert, Bryan Patrick Franklin, and Michael Solis, opened in West Hollywood, California.

==Influences and favourite drummers==
Taylor has stated that his early role model as a drummer was Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix Experience. He said: &quot;I still think listening to Mitch Mitchell, especially the early stuff with Hendrix, is just fantastic. This fusion of jazz technique and wonderful riffs but with this rolling ferocious attack on the whole kit, it had lots of jazz influences I think. In fact for me he played the kit like a song, it was just wonderful. Total integration into the song. Not just marking time&quot;.

Taylor has also expressed great admiration for John Bonham of Led Zeppelin. Speaking of Bonham, Taylor said, &quot;The greatest rock and roll drummer of all time was John Bonham, who did things that nobody had ever even thought possible before with the drum kit. And also the greatest sound out of his drums – they sounded enormous, and just one bass drum. So fast on it that he did more with one bass drum than most people could do with three, if they could manage them. And he had technique to burn and fantastic power and tremendous feel for rock and roll&quot;. For sheer technique, Taylor described the jazz and big band drummer Buddy Rich as &quot;the best I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;.

Speaking to &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; in 1984, Taylor described Keith Moon, the drummer of the Who, as &quot;absolutely brilliant...he had a total unique style; he didn&#x27;t owe anyone anything.&quot;

== Tributes ==
In 2013, a newly discovered species of the genus &quot;Heteragrion&quot; (Odonata: Zygoptera) from Brazil was named &quot;Heteragrion rogertaylori&quot; after Taylor, in honour of his &quot;powerful sound, wonderful lyrics and raspy voice &quot;; one of four &quot;Heteragrion&quot; flatwing damselflies named after the bandmates, paying tribute to the 40th anniversary of Queen&#x27;s founding.

In 1999, Taylor became the second living person, other than members of the British Royal Family and Sir Francis Chichester in 1967, to appear on a Royal Mail stamp, being seen behind Freddie Mercury as part of a &quot;Great Britons&quot; issue. This caused controversy as it was an understood rule that the only living people allowed to appear on British stamps could be members of the Royal Family.

In 2002, Taylor appeared on the &quot;Twelve Drummers Drumming&quot; Christmas card in the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; set sold at Woolworths to raise money for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, alongside Duran Duran&#x27;s drummer of the same name.

Taylor was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to music. At his investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle in March 2022, Taylor dedicated his OBE to the recently deceased Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, adding that Hawkins had been a mentor to his own son Rufus.

<text>Megabyzus (, a folk-etymological alteration of Old Persian Bagabuxša, meaning &quot;God saved&quot;) was an Achaemenid Persian general, son of Zopyrus, satrap of Babylonia, and grandson of Megabyzus I, one of the seven conspirators who had put Darius I on the throne. His father was killed when the satrapy rebelled in 484 BCE, and Megabyzus led the forces that recaptured the city, after which the statue of the god Marduk was destroyed to prevent future revolts. Megabyzus subsequently took part in the Second Persian invasion of Greece (480–479 BCE). Herodotus claims that he refused to act on orders to pillage Delphi, but it is doubtful such orders were ever given.

==Conspiracy of Artabanes==
According to Ctesias, who is not especially reliable but is often our only source, Amytis, wife of Megabyzus and daughter of Xerxes, was accused of adultery shortly afterwards. As such, Megabyzus took part in the conspiracy of Artabanus to assassinate the emperor, but betrayed him before he could kill the new emperor Artaxerxes as well. In a battle, Artabanus&#x27; sons were killed and Megabyzus was wounded, but Amytis interceded on his behalf and he was cured.

==Egyptian campaign==


After this Megabyzus became satrap of Syria. Together with Artabazus, satrap of Phrygia, he had command of the Persian armies sent to put down the revolt of Inarus in Egypt. They arrived in 456 BCE, and within two years had put down the revolt, capturing Inarus and various Athenians supporting him.

===Origin of the Egyptian campaign===
When Xerxes I was assassinated in 465 BCE, he was succeeded by his son Artaxerxes I, but several parts of the Achaemenid empire soon revolted, foremost of which were Bactria and Egypt. The Egyptian Inarus defeated the Persian satrap of Egypt Achaemenes, a brother of Artaxerxes, and took control of Lower Egypt. He contacted the Greeks, who were also officially still at war with Persia, and in 460 BCE, Athens sent an expeditionary force of 200 ships and 6000 heavy infantry to support Inarus. The Egyptian and Athenian troops defeated the local Persian troops of Egypt, and captured the city of Memphis, except for the Persian citadel which they besieged for several years.

===Siege of Memphis (459–455 BCE)===
The Athenians and Egyptians had settled down to besiege the local Persian troops in Egypt, at the White Castle. The siege evidently did not progress well, and probably lasted for at least four years, since Thucydides says that their whole expedition lasted 6 years, and of this time the final 18 months was occupied with the siege of Prosoptis.

According to Thucydides, at first Artaxerxes sent Megabazus to try and bribe the Spartans into invading Attica, to draw off the Athenian forces from Egypt. When this failed, he instead assembled a large army under Megabyzus, and dispatched it to Egypt. Diodorus has more or less the same story, with more detail; after the attempt at bribery failed, Artaxerxes put Megabyzus and Artabazus in charge of 300,000 men, with instructions to quell the revolt. They went first from Persia to Cilicia and gathered a fleet of 300 triremes from the Cilicians, Phoenicians and Cypriots, and spent a year training their men. Then they finally headed to Egypt. Modern estimates, however, place the number of Persian troops at the considerably lower figure of 25,000 men given that it would have been highly impractical to deprive the already strained satrapies of any more man power than that. Thucydides does not mention Artabazus, who is reported by Herodotus to have taken part in the second Persian invasion; Diodorus may be mistaken about his presence in this campaign. It is clearly possible that the Persian forces did spend some prolonged time in training, since it took four years for them to respond to the Egyptian victory at Papremis. Although neither author gives many details, it is clear that when Megabyzus finally arrived in Egypt, he was able to quickly lift the siege of Memphis, defeating the Egyptians in battle, and driving the Athenians from Memphis.

===Siege of Prosopitis (455 BCE)===
The Athenians now fell back to the island of Prosopitis in the Nile delta, where their ships were moored. There, Megabyzus laid siege to them for 18 months, until finally he was able to drain the river from around the island by digging canals, thus &quot;joining the island to the mainland&quot;. In Thucydides&#x27;s account the Persians then crossed over to the former island, and captured it. Only a few of the Athenian force, marching through Libya to Cyrene survived to return to Athens. In Diodorus&#x27;s version, however, the draining of the river prompted the Egyptians (whom Thucydides does not mention) to defect and surrender to the Persians. The Persians, not wanting to sustain heavy casualties in attacking the Athenians, instead allowed them to depart freely to Cyrene, whence they returned to Athens. Since the defeat of the Egyptian expedition caused a genuine panic in Athens, including the relocation of the Delian treasury to Athens, Thucydides&#x27;s version is probably more likely to be correct.

==Cyprus campaign==
They then turned their attention to Cyprus, which was under attack by the Athenians, led by Cimon. Shortly afterwards hostilities between Persia and Athens ceased, called the peace of Callias.

==Revolt==
Some time later Megabyzus himself revolted. Ctesias tells us the reason was that Amestris had the captives from the Egyptian revolt executed, though Megabyzus had given his word that they would not be harmed.

Armies under Usiris of Egypt and the prince Menostanes, a nephew of the king, were sent against him, both forgoing battle for (non-fatal) duels between the generals, and in both cases Megabyzus was victorious. The king resolved to send his brother Artarius, the eunuch Artoxares and Amytis in a peace embassy. His honour restored, Megabyzus agreed to surrender and was pardoned, retaining his position. Some time later, Megabyzus saved Artaxerxes from a lion in a hunt and was subsequently exiled to Cyrtae for violating the royal prerogative to make the first kill, but he returned to Susa by pretending to be a leper and was pardoned.

Megabyzus died shortly afterwards, at age 76. His son Zopyrus II is known to have lived as an exile in Athens, and aided in its assault on Caunus during his father&#x27;s exile, where he was killed by a rock.

<text>The Battle of Aegospotami () was a naval confrontation that took place in 405 BC and was the last major battle of the Peloponnesian War. In the battle, a Spartan fleet under Lysander destroyed the Athenian navy. This effectively ended the war, since Athens could not import grain or communicate with its empire without control of the sea.

==Prelude==
===Lysander&#x27;s campaigns===
In 405 BC, following the severe Spartan defeat at the Battle of Arginusae, Lysander, the commander who had been responsible for the first Spartan naval successes, was reinstated in command. Since the Spartan constitution prohibited any commander from holding the office of navarch more than once, he was appointed as a vice-admiral instead, with the clear understanding that this was a mere legal fiction.

One of Lysander&#x27;s advantages as a commander was his close relationship with the Persian prince Cyrus. Using this connection, he quickly raised the money to begin rebuilding the Spartan fleet. When Cyrus was recalled to Susa by his father Darius, he gave Lysander the revenues from all of his cities of Asia Minor. With the resources of this entire wealthy Persian province at his disposal, Lysander was able to quickly reconstitute his fleet.

He then set off on a series of campaigns throughout the Aegean. He seized several Athenian-held cities, and attacked numerous islands. He was unable to move north to the Hellespont, however, because of the threat from the Athenian fleet at Samos. To divert the Athenians, Lysander struck westward. Approaching quite near to Athens itself, he attacked Aegina and Salamis, and even landed in Attica. The Athenian fleet set out in pursuit, but Lysander sailed around them, reached the Hellespont, and established a base at Abydos. From there, he seized the strategically important town of Lampsacus, opening the way to the Bosporus. Should he reach the strait, he could close down the trade routes from which Athens received the majority of her grain. If the Athenians were to avoid starvation, Lysander had to be contained immediately.

===Athenian response===
The Athenian fleet of 180 ships caught up with Lysander shortly after he had taken Lampsacus, and established a base at Sestos. However, perhaps because of the need to keep a close watch on Lysander, they set up camp on a beach much nearer to Lampsacus. The location was less than ideal because of the lack of a harbor and the difficulty of supplying the fleet, but proximity seems to have been the primary concern in the minds of the Athenian generals. Every day, the fleet sailed out to Lampsacus in battle formation, and waited outside the harbor; when Lysander refused to emerge, they returned home.

===Alcibiades&#x27;s involvement===
At this time, the exiled Athenian leader Alcibiades was living in his ship&#x27;s castle near the Athenian camp. Coming down to the beach where the ships were gathered, he made several suggestions to the generals. First, he proposed relocating the fleet to the more secure base at Sestos. Second, he claimed that several Thracian kings had offered to provide him with an army. If the generals would offer him a share of the command, he claimed, he would use this army to assist the Athenians. The generals, however, declined this offer and rejected his advice. Spurned, Alcibiades returned to his home.

==Battle==

Two accounts of the battle of Aegospotami exist. Diodorus Siculus relates that the Athenian general in command on the fifth day at Sestos, Philocles, sailed out with thirty ships, ordering the rest to follow him. Donald Kagan has argued that the Athenian strategy, if this account is accurate, must have been to draw the Peloponnesians into an attack on the small force so that the larger force following could surprise them. In the event, the small force was immediately defeated, and the remainder of the fleet was caught unprepared on the beach.

Xenophon, in contrast, relates that the entire Athenian fleet came out as usual on the day of the battle and Lysander remained in the harbor. When the Athenians returned to their camp, the sailors scattered to forage for food; Lysander&#x27;s fleet then sailed across from Abydos and captured most of the ships on the beach, with no sea fighting at all.

Whichever account of the battle itself is accurate, the result is clear. The Athenian fleet was obliterated; only nine ships escaped, led by the general Conon. Lysander captured nearly all of the remainder, along with some three or four thousand Athenian sailors. One of the escaped ships, the messenger ship Paralus, was dispatched to inform Athens of the disaster. The rest, with Conon, sought refuge with Evagoras, a friendly ruler in Cyprus.

Some historians, ancient and modern, suspect that the battle was lost as the result of treachery, perhaps on the part of Adeimantus, who was the only Athenian commander the Spartans captured during the battle who was not put to death, and perhaps with the treasonous connivance of the oligarchical faction at Athens, who may have wanted their city defeated in order to overthrow the democracy. But this all remains speculative.

==Aftermath==
Lysander and his victorious fleet sailed back to Lampsacus. Citing a previous Athenian atrocity when the captured sailors of two ships were thrown overboard, Lysander and his allies slaughtered Philocles and 3,000 Athenian prisoners, sparing other Greek captives. Lysander&#x27;s fleet then began moving slowly towards Athens, capturing cities along the way. The Athenians, with no fleet, were powerless to oppose him. Only at Samos did Lysander meet resistance; the democratic government there, fiercely loyal to Athens, refused to give in, and Lysander left a besieging force behind him.

Xenophon reports that when the news of the defeat reached Athens,

Fearing the retribution that the victorious Spartans might take on them, the Athenians resolved to hold out from the siege, but their cause was hopeless. Without a fleet to import grain from the Black Sea, and with the Spartan occupation of Deceleia cutting off land transportation, the Athenians were beginning to starve, and with people dying of hunger in the streets, the city surrendered in March 404 BC. The walls of the city were demolished, and a pro-Spartan oligarchic government was established (the so-called Thirty Tyrants&#x27; regime). The Spartan victory at Aegospotami marked the end of 27 years of war, placing Sparta in a position of complete dominance throughout the Greek world and establishing a political order that would last for more than thirty years.

==Commemoration of the battle==
The Spartans commemorated their victory with a dedication at Delphi of statues of the trierarchs who had fought in the battle. A verse inscription explained the circumstances:

:These men, sailing with Lysander in the swift ships, humbled the might of the city of Cecrops
:And made Lacedaemon of the beautiful choruses the high city of Hellas.

<text>Porphyrins ( ) are a group of heterocyclic, macrocyclic, organic compounds, composed of four modified pyrrole subunits interconnected at their α carbon atoms via methine bridges (). In vertebrates, an essential member of the porphyrin group is heme, which is a component of hemoproteins, whose functions include carrying oxygen in the bloodstream. In plants, an essential porphyrin derivative is chlorophyll, which is involved in light harvesting and electron transfer in photosynthesis.

The parent of porphyrins is porphine, a rare chemical compound of exclusively theoretical interest. Substituted porphines are called porphyrins. With a total of 26 π-electrons, of which 18 π-electrons form a planar, continuous cycle, the porphyrin ring structure is often described as aromatic. One result of the large conjugated system is that porphyrins typically absorb strongly in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e. they are deeply colored. The name &quot;porphyrin&quot; derives .

==Structure==

Porphyrin complexes consist of a square planar MN4 core. The periphery of the porphyrins, consisting of sp2-hybridized carbons, generally display small deviations from planarity. &quot;Ruffled&quot; or saddle-shaped porphyrins is attributed to interactions of the system with its environment. Additionally, the metal is often not centered in the N4 plane. For free porphyrins, the two pyrrole protons are mutually trans and project out of the N4 plane. These nonplanar distortions are associated with altered chemical and physical properties. Chlorophyll-rings are more distinctly nonplanar, but they are more saturated than porphyrins.

==Complexes of porphyrins==

Concomitant with the displacement of two N-&quot;H&quot; protons, porphyrins bind metal ions in the N4 &quot;pocket&quot;. The metal ion usually has a charge of 2+ or 3+. A schematic equation for these syntheses is shown, where M = metal ion and L = a ligand:


==Ancient porphyrins==
A geoporphyrin, also known as a petroporphyrin, is a porphyrin of geologic origin. They can occur in crude oil, oil shale, coal, or sedimentary rocks. Abelsonite is possibly the only geoporphyrin mineral, as it is rare for porphyrins to occur in isolation and form crystals.

The field of organic geochemistry had its origins in the isolation of porphyrins from petroleum. This finding helped establish the biological origins of petroleum. Petroleum is sometimes &quot;fingerprinted&quot; by analysis of trace amounts of nickel and vanadyl porphyrins.

==Biosynthesis==
In non-photosynthetic eukaryotes such as animals, insects, fungi, and protozoa, as well as the α-proteobacteria group of bacteria, the committed step for porphyrin biosynthesis is the formation of δ-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA, 5-ALA or dALA) by the reaction of the amino acid glycine with succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle. In plants, algae, bacteria (except for the α-proteobacteria group) and archaea, it is produced from glutamic acid via glutamyl-tRNA and glutamate-1-semialdehyde. The enzymes involved in this pathway are glutamyl-tRNA synthetase, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, and glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase. This pathway is known as the C5 or Beale pathway.

Two molecules of dALA are then combined by porphobilinogen synthase to give porphobilinogen (PBG), which contains a pyrrole ring. Four PBGs are then combined through deamination into hydroxymethyl bilane (HMB), which is hydrolysed to form the circular tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen III. This molecule undergoes a number of further modifications. Intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances, but, in humans, the main end-product protoporphyrin IX is combined with iron to form heme. Bile pigments are the breakdown products of heme.

The following scheme summarizes the biosynthesis of porphyrins, with references by EC number and the OMIM database. The porphyria associated with the deficiency of each enzyme is also shown:

==Laboratory synthesis==
A common synthesis for porphyrins is the Rothemund reaction, first reported in 1936, which is also the basis for more recent methods described by Adler and Longo. The general scheme is a condensation and oxidation process starting with pyrrole and an aldehyde.


==Potential applications==
===Photodynamic therapy===
Porphyrins have been evaluated in the context of photodynamic therapy (PDT) since they strongly absorb light, which is then converted to heat in the illuminated areas. This technique has been applied in macular degeneration using verteporfin.

PDT is considered a noninvasive cancer treatment, involving the interaction between light of a determined frequency, a photo-sensitizer, and oxygen. This interaction produces the formation of a highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), usually singlet oxygen, as well as superoxide anion, free hydroxyl radical, or hydrogen peroxide. These high reactive oxygen species react with susceptible cellular organic biomolecules such as; lipids, aromatic amino acids, and nucleic acid heterocyclic bases, to produce oxidative radicals that damage the cell, possibly inducing apoptosis or even necrosis.

===Molecular electronics and sensors===
Porphyrin-based compounds are of interest as possible components of molecular electronics and photonics. Synthetic porphyrin dyes have been incorporated in prototype dye-sensitized solar cells.

=== Biological applications ===
Porphyrins have been investigated as possible anti-inflammatory agents and evaluated on their anti-cancer and anti-oxidant activity. Several porphyrin-peptide conjugates were found to have antiviral activity against HIV &quot;in vitro&quot;.

=== Toxicology ===
Heme biosynthesis is used as biomarker in environmental toxicology studies. While excess production of porphyrins indicate organochlorine exposure, lead inhibits ALA dehydratase enzyme.

==Related species==
===In nature===

Several heterocycles related to porphyrins are found in nature, almost always bound to metal ions. These include
===Synthetic===
A benzoporphyrin is a porphyrin with a benzene ring fused to one of the pyrrole units. e.g. verteporfin is a benzoporphyrin derivative.

====Non-natural porphyrin isomers====
The first synthetic porphyrin isomer was reported by Emanual Vogel and coworkers in 1986. This isomer [18]porphyrin-(2.0.2.0) is named as porphycene, and the central N4 Cavity forms a rectangle shape as shown in figure. Porphycenes showed interesting photophysical behavior and found versatile compound towards the photodynamic therapy. This inspired Vogel and Sessler to took up the challenge of preparing [18]porphyrin-(2.1.0.1) and named it as corrphycene or porphycerin. The third porphyrin that is [18]porphyrin-(2.1.1.0), was reported by Callot and Vogel-Sessler. Vogel and coworkers reported successful isolation of [18]porphyrin-(3.0.1.0) or isoporphycene. The Japanese scientist Furuta and Polish scientist Latos-Grażyński almost simultaneously reported the N-confused porphyrins. The inversion of one of the pyrrolic subunits in the macrocyclic ring resulted in one of the nitrogen atoms facing outwards from the core of the macrocycle.

<text>Microdictyon is an extinct armoured worm-like panarthropod coated with net-like scleritic plates, known from the Early Cambrian Maotianshan shale of Yunnan China and other parts of the world. &quot;Microdictyon&quot; is part of the ill-defined taxon – Lobopodia – that includes several other odd worm-like animals that resembling worm with legs, such as &quot;Hallucigenia&quot;, &quot;Onychodictyon&quot;, &quot;Cardiodictyon&quot;, &quot;Luolishania&quot;, and &quot;Paucipodia&quot;. The isolated sclerites of &quot;Microdictyon&quot; are known from other Lower Cambrian deposits. &quot;Microdictyon&quot; sclerites appear to have moulted; one sclerite seems to have been preserved during ecdysis.

&quot;Microdictyon sinicum&quot; (Chen, Hou and Lu, 1989) is typical. The wormlike animal has ten pairs of sclerites (suggestions that these may be eyes or eye-like structures have no weight) on the sides, matched to a pair of tentacle-like feet below. The head and posterior are tubular and featureless.

<doc id="182501" wikidata="Q968955" url="?curid=182501" title="Roger Taylor (Duran Duran drummer)">
<text>Roger Andrew Taylor (born 26 April 1960) is an English musician, best known as the drummer of the new wave band Duran Duran from their inception until 1985, and again from 2001 onwards. Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Taylor was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in November 2022 as a member of Duran Duran.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Roger Andrew Taylor was born into a modest family and was brought up in the Shard End area of Birmingham until the age of 11, and then a small suburban house in Castle Bromwich (15 Hawthorne Road). His father worked in the car industry. He began drumming at around the age of 12, teaching himself by playing along with his favourite records. His first ambition was to be a goalkeeper for English football club Aston Villa, and as a child he was taken to every home match by his father. He would eventually &quot;play&quot; at Villa Park but as Duran Duran&#x27;s drummer for their 1983 charity concert there. Taylor has cited Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones and Budgie of Siouxsie and the Banshees as two of his favourite drummers.

Before joining Duran Duran, Taylor performed with several school (Park Hall School in Castle Bromwich, Warwickshire) and local club bands. After being inspired by the punk bands playing at Barbarellas club in Birmingham, he formed the new wave/punk outfit Scent Organs, who became regional finalists in the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; young band of the year in 1978, and was briefly a member of post-punk band Cult Figures. After Scent Organs split in 1979, he joined Duran Duran. He became known as &#x27;the quiet one&#x27; and has said that he has always preferred to speak through his drums.

===1979–1986: Duran Duran===

Taylor became an international star with the other members of Duran Duran as they rose to fame in the early 1980s. The video for the debut single &quot;Planet Earth&quot; opens with a shot of a reclining, bare-chested Taylor looking slowly up to the sky. He played drums on the band&#x27;s first three studio albums (&quot;Duran Duran&quot;, &quot;Rio&quot;, and &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;) and the live album &quot;Arena&quot;. In 1985, the band recorded the theme to the James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;, which became their second US No. 1 hit and the only Bond theme to date to reach No. 1 there. However, the intense schedule of recording and touring, coupled with the pressures of fame, left Taylor unhappy with being in the band. His final performance with the original line-up of Duran Duran was in July 1985 at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia, which reached a global audience of 2 billion people. Taylor and the band had each picked up two Grammy awards during this period.

Prior to leaving the band, he worked with Duran Duran bandmates Simon Le Bon and Nick Rhodes on the album &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; for their side project Arcadia in 1985. The album featured Sting, David Gilmour, Herbie Hancock and Grace Jones. Taylor also contributed percussion to the other Duran Duran splinter group the Power Station&#x27;s song &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; from their self-titled album. He then purchased a remote farm estate in the hills of Gloucestershire to live a quiet life away from the music world. &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper tracked him down and devoted a whole page to his departure, dubbing him &#x27;the hermit of pop&#x27;. Initially his hiatus was expected to be for a year, but in 1986 the remaining members of the band issued a statement saying that he was leaving Duran Duran.

===1994 and 2001–present: Second tenure in Duran Duran===
In 1994, while visiting a friend in Paris, he temporarily joined Duran Duran to play drums on three tracks for the covers album &quot;Thank You&quot; (although only two ended up on the album), later appearing in the video for &quot;Perfect Day&quot; and on the band&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performance of the song.

In 1997, Taylor regained his appetite for the music industry. He briefly formed the electro/dance band Freebass, which produced a single, &quot;Love Is Like Oxygen&quot;, (a cover of a song by Sweet) on underground dance label Cleveland City Records. The record reached the top ten of the Music Week UK Dance Chart. Taylor also produced electro house tracks with Freebass member Jake Roberts under the name Funk Face. &quot;Lost This Feeling&quot; and &quot;Shine&quot; were released on Taylor&#x27;s own label, Rt Music.

He rejoined Duran Duran in 2001, as all five of the &quot;Rio&quot;-era members reunited to record new material and perform as a quintet again. This culminated in five sold-out nights at Wembley Arena, playing Madison Square Garden again, and signing with Epic Records in New York. The band delivered a hit single &#x27;(Reach Up for The) Sunrise&#x27; and a hit album &quot;Astronaut&quot;.

The &#x27;Astronaut&#x27; tour lasted for more than two years, with shows all around the world. The band picked up several prestigious &#x27;achievement&#x27; awards from &quot;Q&quot; magazine and MTV, and a Brit award.

He began a long-running DJ residency at London&#x27;s Met Bar in 2003, playing a mix of house and hip-hop, and has gone on to become a renowned DJ over recent years, performing sets at Cielo New York and Pacha Ibiza along with friend and former Freebass band mate Jake (Fonique) Roberts.

The &quot;All You Need Is Now&quot; album was released on 21 December 2010 to worldwide critical acclaim. It immediately reached the number 1 spot on the iTunes pop chart in 15 countries. Duran Duran commenced a supporting tour running well into 2012 reaching far and wide across the world. The band also played to an audience of 70,000 people in Hyde Park to coincide with the opening of the 2012 London Olympic Games. Taylor then began working with his bandmates on the 14th Duran Duran album with producers Mark Ronson, Ben Hudson and Nile Rodgers; &quot;Paper Gods&quot; was released in 2015.

In January 2016, Peace Tracks, a charitable organization that aims to bridge different cultures and countries through music, released a number of songs that featured Taylor in collaboration with members of ABBA, Philip Glass, Angélique Kidjo, and Anoushka Shankar.

==Personal life==
Taylor has three children with his first wife Giovanna Cantone, whom he later divorced. In 2004, he was named Britain&#x27;s fifth most eligible bachelor in the UK high society magazine &quot;Tatler&quot;, alongside Prince William and Hugh Grant. Taylor married Peruvian national Gisella Bernales on the Caribbean island of St Lucia in 2007. They have one son.

<text>An armed merchantman is a merchant ship equipped with guns, usually for defensive purposes, either by design or after the fact. In the days of sail, piracy and privateers, many merchantmen would be routinely armed, especially those engaging in long distance and high value trade. In more modern times, auxiliary cruisers were used offensively as merchant raiders to disrupt trade chiefly during both World War I and World War II, particularly by Germany.

While armed merchantmen are clearly inferior to purpose-built warships, sometimes they have scored successes in combat against them. Examples include East Indiamen mimicking ships of the line and chasing off regular French warships in the Battle of Pulo Aura in 1804, and the sinking the Australian light cruiser in their battle in 1941, although &quot;Kormoran&quot; was also destroyed and had to be scuttled.

== Pre-20th century ==

East Indiamen of various European countries were heavily armed for their long journeys to the Far East. In particularly dangerous times, such as when the home countries were at war, a convoy system would be used whereby the ships were escorted by a warship. However, many East Indiamen also travelled on their own, and therefore were heavily armed in order to defend themselves against pirates and privateers. They also defended themselves against warships, scoring signal victories at the Battle of Pulo Aura and the action of 4 August 1800. The British Royal Navy purchased several that it converted to ships of the line.

=== Development of auxiliary cruisers ===
In 1856, privateering (or seizure of a belligerent country&#x27;s merchant ships as a private enterprise) lost international sanction under the Declaration of Paris. From 1861 to 1865 European countries built high-speed ships to run the Union Blockade during the American Civil War. Some of these were armed and served as Confederate States Navy raiders.

Russia purchased three ships in 1878 of armed with guns for use as auxiliary cruisers for a Russian Volunteer Fleet. Germany and the United Kingdom responded to the precedent by asking their shipping companies to design fast steamers with provision for mounting guns in time of war.

In 1890 German and British shipyards built new civilian ships designed for wartime conversion, and France, Italy, Japan, Austria-Hungary, and the United States made similar agreements with their shipyards. In 1892 Russia likewise built two more auxiliary cruisers.

In 1895 the Imperial German Navy mobilized the provisional auxiliary cruiser &quot;Normannia&quot; for a 15-day trial armed with eight 6-inch guns, two guns, six guns, and two torpedo boats.

== 20th century ==
In both World Wars, both Germany and the United Kingdom used auxiliary cruisers. While the British used armed passenger liners defensively for protecting their shipping, the German approach was to use them offensively to attack enemy shipping.

=== Armed merchant cruisers ===

The armed merchant cruisers (AMC) of the British Royal Navy were employed for convoy protection against enemy warships. They ultimately proved to have limited value and many, particularly ocean liners, were later converted into troopships, a role for which they were more suited. Documentary evidence quoted by the BBC researched from the early stages of the First World War suggests that the express liners had greater speed than most warships (few warships of the period could exceed 21 knots), which made them suitable as AMCs. The downside proved to be their high fuel consumption; using them in a purely AMC role would have burned through the Admiralty reserve supplies of steam coal in less than three months. The ships were vulnerable to enemy fire because they lacked warship armour, and they used local control of guns rather than director fire-control systems, which reduced their effective fire power.

A famous AMC of World War I was the British which, after a battle that caused heavy damage on both sides, sank the German auxiliary cruiser near the Brazilian island of Trindade in 1914. By coincidence, &quot;Cap Trafalgar&quot; was disguised as &quot;Carmania&quot;. In World War II, , the sole escort for convoy HX 84 in November 1940, stood off the pocket battleship , when the German ship attacked the convoy. Though she and five vessels of the convoy were sunk, this enabled the rest of the convoy to escape. Her master, Acting Captain Edward Fegen was awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously for his actions. Another famous action involving an armed merchant cruiser was the November 1939 battle between and the German battlecruisers and . Outgunned, the &quot;Rawalpindi&quot; was quickly sunk.

=== Auxiliary cruisers ===
The Spanish and United States Navies used auxiliary cruisers during the Spanish–American War of 1898. In World War I, too, American auxiliary cruisers fought several engagements with German U-boats.

The German practice was to arm merchantmen with hidden weapons and use them as commerce raiders. An auxiliary cruiser, &quot;Hilfskreuzer&quot; or &quot;Handels-Stör-Kreuzer&quot; (HSK), usually approached her target under a false flag with guns concealed, and sometimes with her appearance altered with fake funnels and masts and often a fake paint scheme. The victim was thus engaged at point-blank range and had no chance to escape. In World War I, the Imperial German Navy initially used fast passenger ships, such as past holders of the Blue Riband for fastest North Atlantic crossings, but they made obvious and easy targets because of their very familiar silhouettes. The Germans, therefore, soon moved on to using captured and refitted Allied vessels, but principally modified transport ships. These were slower, but less recognizable. In both world wars, these ships were vulnerable to attack, and were withdrawn before the war ended. Many were sunk after being caught by regular warships – an unequal battle, since auxiliary cruisers had poor fire control and no armor. There were, however, a few success stories. was a former passenger liner that sank two freighters in 1914 before being caught by . Her sister ship, , had a legendary journey, sinking or capturing a total of 15 ships in 1914 and 1915, before finally running out of supplies and having to put into port in Virginia, where the Americans interned her and eventually converted her into the United States Navy troop transport USS &quot;Von Steuben&quot;. The most famous German commerce raider of World War I probably was , a sailing ship under the command of the legendary Count Felix von Luckner. However, both and were each much more successful than &quot;Seeadler&quot;.

In World War II, Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; operated ten very successful auxiliary cruisers, ranging in tonnage from 3,860 to 9,400; typically these vessels were equipped with:
* Observation seaplanes
* 15 cm (6 in) guns
* Smaller armaments (typically hidden away behind specially designed and hinged bulwarks, or beneath fake deckhouses and/or skylights)
* Torpedoes
* Mines

To preserve their cover, these ships flew the flags of neutral or occasionally Allied nations. They were refueled and provisioned from special supply ships, from Japanese island bases or from prizes they had taken. To counter the effectiveness of these disguises, the Allies introduced the check-mate system in 1942 to identify individual ships on a one-by-one basis with the Admiralty in London.
In one incident, the German (ex-merchantman &quot;Steiermark&quot;) managed to surprise and sink the Australian light cruiser , which approached too close, though &quot;Kormoran&quot; was also sunk in the engagement. This was the only occasion in history when an armed merchantman managed to sink a modern warship; in most cases, auxiliary cruiser raiders tried to avoid confrontation with warships. &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s attack upon &quot;Sydney&quot; was motivated by desperation. She was not the most successful German raider of World War II (both and scored higher kill tonnages). Another, , was also sunk in a mutually destructive engagement with the American Liberty ship .

The only encounters between Allied and Axis auxiliary cruisers in World War II were all with the raider . This small vessel, which captured or sank 22 merchantmen, encountered three British AMCs in her career, defeating and and later sinking HMS &quot;Voltaire&quot; in the Action of 4 April 1941. During World War II, German auxiliary cruisers are believed to have either sunk or captured some of Allied shipping. Compare to the Q-ship, which was a disguised merchantman for anti-submarine operations.

=== Others ===
The CAM ship (from catapult armed merchantman) was a British merchantman fitted with a catapult that could launch, but not recover, a single fighter aircraft.

The merchant aircraft carrier or &quot;MAC&quot; was a British or Dutch cargo ship with a flight deck that could carry a small number of aircraft.

CAM and MAC ships remained as civilian ships operated by civilian crews, with Fleet Air Arm or Royal Netherlands Navy &quot;air parties&quot;.

== 21st century ==
Despite a rise in modern piracy, up until the early 2010s it was very unusual for modern merchant ships to be armed, save for maybe a number of small arms and the use of the ship&#x27;s fire hoses to repel boarders. One notable exception to this were the ships of Pacific Nuclear Transport Limited, which are used to transport spent nuclear fuel and reprocessed uranium on behalf of British Nuclear Fuels Limited. Transporting enough fissile material between them to produce 50–60 nuclear weapons, these ships, beginning with the &quot;Pacific Pintail&quot; and &quot;Pacific Teal&quot;, became armed in 1999 to avoid the cost of a Royal Navy escort. Travelling together in convoy during these ships&#x27; intermittent voyages, they have an onboard escort of armed police from the UKAEAC and its successors and are equipped with two or three autocannons. Another exception were various ships of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Merchant Marine (MORFLOT) during the Cold War (MORFLOT often operated as an adjunct to Soviet foreign and military policy, both overtly and otherwise).

In 2007, facing a chronic shortage of naval vessels the Cuban Navy placed into service the &quot;Rio Damuji&quot; class of frigates, which are large fishing trawlers converted into warships.

In April 2010, it was reported that a Russian company was offering a version of the 3M-54 Klub missile that could be disguised and launched from a shipping container, in theory enabling any cargo ship to be armed with an anti-ship missile. This type of missile was allegedly capable of disabling or even sinking an aircraft carrier, but &quot;it&#x27;s not known how many of them would have to hit a carrier to knock it out of action, much less sink it.&quot;

During the 2011 Libyan civil war, forces loyal to Gaddafi armed several merchant vessels and attempted to use them to blockade the port of Misrata.

In October 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that British merchant shipping passing through areas known for piracy were permitted to carry firearms.

== Ship list ==

<text>The German auxiliary cruiser Kormoran&quot; (HSK-8)&quot;&#x27; was a (German navy) merchant raider of World War II. Originally the merchant vessel &#x27; (), the ship was acquired by the navy following the outbreak of war for conversion into a raider. Administered under the designation (), to the Allied navies she was known as &quot;Raider G&quot;. The largest merchant raider operated by Germany during World War II, &quot;Kormoran&quot; () was responsible for the destruction of 10 merchant vessels and the capture of an 11th during her year-long career in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.

She is also known for sinking the Australian light cruiser during a mutually destructive battle off Western Australia on 19 November 1941. Damage sustained during the battle prompted the scuttling of &quot;Kormoran&quot;. While 318 of the 399 aboard the German ship were rescued and placed in prisoner of war camps for the remainder of World War II, and then for almost two further years after the war with Germany had ended, there were no survivors from the 645 aboard the Australian cruiser. The wreck of &quot;Kormoran&quot; was rediscovered on 12 March 2008, four days before that of her adversary.

&quot;Kormoran&quot;″s success against HMAS &quot;Sydney&quot; is commonly attributed to the proximity of the two ships during the engagement, and the raider&#x27;s advantages of surprise and rapid, accurate fire. Prior to the discovery of the wrecks in 2008, the cruiser&#x27;s loss with all hands compared to the survival of most of the German crew created controversy and spawned numerous conspiracy theories; some alleged that the German commander, Theodor Detmers, used illegal ruses to lure &quot;Sydney&quot; into range, others that a Japanese submarine was involved, or that details of the battle were concealed through a wide-ranging coverup. None of these claims have ever been substantiated by any evidence.

== Construction and conversion ==
The merchant vessel was constructed by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft in Kiel for the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Launched in 1938, the ship was to operate on the East Asia run, but had completed only sea trials when war was declared.

Following World War I, German naval power had limits placed upon it by the Treaty of Versailles, which were later eased by the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement. By the 1930s, the discrepancy between the conventional warship strength of Germany and that of other nations led the German military to recognize that auxiliary cruisers engaged in commerce raiding could play a significant role in future wars, as they had during World War I. Merchant ships that could be converted into raiders were identified, and were to be taken up by the for conversion following a declaration of war.

 was one of these ships. Receiving the designation () for administrative purposes, she was taken into dockyard hands following the outbreak of World War II. Conversion of the merchant ship commenced in early 1940, and was prioritized as second only to work on the U-boat fleet. The conversion work included installation of camouflaged weapons, fitting of bunks for the sailors, creation of internal passageways leading to their stations. Prisoner accommodation, consisting of an open area for hammocks and facilities to keep ship&#x27;s masters and women separate from the general population, were constructed. The raider was also provided with equipment with which to modify her appearance and allow her to masquerade as other merchant vessels. While the ship was being refitted, her future crew underwent training aboard the blockade runner &quot;Monte Pascoal&quot;.

 (Lieutenant Commander) Theodor Detmers was selected to command in July 1940; the 37-year-old was the youngest man to command a German merchant raider. Detmers named the ship &quot;Kormoran&quot;, inspired by (a Russian merchant ship captured by the Germans during World War I and operated as a raider) and the cormorant (with Detmers comparing the seabird&#x27;s use in fishing to his ship&#x27;s attempts in catching Allied vessels). After a successful trials cruise in September 1940, &quot;Kormoran&quot; was commissioned on 9 October.

== Design ==
&quot;Kormoran&quot; was one of nine civilian ships taken up by the German Navy for conversion into merchant raiders; they were referred to alternately as (auxiliary cruisers) and (). She was the largest of the raiders, and the most recently constructed when she was taken up for modification. After modification, &quot;Kormoran&quot; was long and wide, with a gross register tonnage of 8,736. She was propelled by four 9-cylinder diesel engines driving electric motors, which could propel the ship at .
The raider was fitted with six SK L/45 guns as primary armament: two each within the forecastle (&quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;) and quarterdeck (&quot;5&quot; and &quot;6&quot;), and one each fore and aft (&quot;3&quot; and &quot;4&quot; respectively) on the centreline. These guns were ; gun &quot;3&quot; had been removed from the battlecruiser in 1916. The forecastle and quarterdeck guns were hidden behind counter-weighted false hull plates, while each centreline gun was concealed by fake cargo hatch walls.

The secondary armament consisted of five anti-aircraft guns: two on the forecastle, two on the after funnel deck, and the fifth in the quarterdeck. All five were hidden by the structure of the ship until they were raised clear on hydraulic platforms. There were plans to fit four anti-aircraft guns, but only two ex-army anti-tank guns could be scrounged; these were installed on &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s superstructure, hidden by sheet metal panels. &quot;Kormoran&quot; was also equipped with six torpedo tubes: two dual launchers on the upper deck, and a single underwater tube on each side. The underwater tubes were amidships, angled at 135° from the bow, and could only be fired if the raider was travelling at less than . &quot;Kormoran&quot; carried a payload of mines, with an LS-3 fast boat carried inside No. 6 cargo hatch for minelaying.
The raider carried two Arado Ar 196 floatplanes for reconnaissance. Although Detmers wanted a catapult, such equipment would have spoiled any merchant ship disguise used by &quot;Kormoran&quot;; instead, the planes were stored inside No. 5 cargo hatch, and were launched and recovered from the water with hoists. Mechanical problems, difficulties in moving the aircraft between the hatch and the water, plus a lack of opportunities meant that only seven flights were made during the ship&#x27;s operational deployment.

== Operational history ==
=== Running the blockade ===
The day after commissioning, &quot;Kormoran&quot; sailed to Kiel, where she was provisioned for a 12-month voyage. The raider then travelled to and underwent further trials of the ship&#x27;s weapons, aircraft, and minelaying boat. Despite a range of problems and defects, Detmers elected to repair problems at sea instead of taking the ship into dock and delaying their mission.
The raider departed on 3 December, and once she cleared German waters on 10 December, her disguise was changed from a minesweeper to the Soviet freighter . The Royal Navy had blockaded German waters at the start of the war, and &quot;Kormoran&quot; had to break through to reach her first patrol area. It was suggested that the raider either sail through the English Channel with support from captured French coastal batteries and the , or around the Faroe Islands. Detmers chose to travel north of Iceland and through the Denmark Strait before heading south. The longer route was justified by its greater distance from British naval and aviation bases, and was thus less likely to be patrolled. The raider reached the strait late in the evening of 12 December, passed through it under the cover of a heavy storm, and entered the Atlantic by the following midday without encountering any Allied ships.

=== Atlantic Ocean ===
Having cleared the British blockade, &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s instructions were to search the Atlantic Ocean for targets of opportunity, then move to the Indian Ocean and seek out Allied merchant shipping, with additional orders to lay mines around one or more Allied ports in India or Australia. &quot;Kormoran&quot; was also expected to replenish U-boats when ordered to do so, and carried extra torpedoes and spare parts. The raider&#x27;s first operational area was in the Atlantic, below latitude 40° north, which she crossed during the night of 19–20 December. The German ship initially patrolled the western mid-Atlantic, outside the Pan-American Security Zone. During the first two weeks, the only ships spotted were merchant vessels flying the United States flag, which merchant raiders were forbidden to attack as they were still neutral.

By 6 January 1941, Detmers was ready to relocate to a point west of the Mediterranean because of a lack of targets, but that afternoon, &quot;Kormoran&quot; encountered the 3,729-ton Greek freighter &quot;Antonis&quot;. The raider ordered the freighter to heave to and not send any wireless transmissions, and sent a boarding party over. &quot;Antonis&quot; was armed with three British machine guns and loaded with 4,800 tons of Welsh coal. Though Germany was not at war with Greece, the presence of Allied weapons and cargo allowed Detmers to sink her or take her as a prize. As coal was of little use to the , the weapons, ammunition, and 29 crew were transferred to &quot;Kormoran&quot;, and the boarding party scuttled her at . Admiralty notifications for raider activity gave an incorrect date and location for the attack, and initially attributed it to the raider . &quot;Kormoran&quot; then headed southeast, avoiding the convoy routes from the Mediterranean to America and down the African coast, in order to seek vessels sailing alone and without warship escort.

Before sunset on 18 January, smoke was spotted on the horizon, so &quot;Kormoran&quot; accelerated and altered course to pursue. The source of the smoke was a tanker flying no flags, showing no lights, and zigzagging to thwart submarine attack, leading Detmers to conclude she was an Allied vessel. With little time before the sun set and the likelihood the tanker would resist capture, &quot;Kormoran&quot; commenced fire at in an attempt to disable the ship. When the third salvo hit, the merchantman broadcast a distress call, identifying herself as &quot;British Union&quot; and saying she was under attack by an unknown vessel at . Firing continued until &quot;British Union&quot; directed a light towards &quot;Kormoran&quot;, which the Germans assumed was a surrender signal, but as the raider closed to , four shots were fired by the tanker. All four missed, and heavy retaliatory fire from the raider set the merchant ship alight and forced the crew to abandon ship. The decision was made to destroy the 6,987-ton tanker with a torpedo, although two torpedoes and shells from the raider&#x27;s main guns were required to sink her, while a third torpedo exploded as soon as it cleared its safety distance and armed; Detmers later stated the quantity of ammunition used during the attempted capture was excessive for the result obtained. The tanker&#x27;s master, 27 sailors, and a pet monkey were recovered from two lifeboats as the tanker sank at , and the raider fled the area. The distress call and glow from the fires attracted the attention of the armed merchant cruiser , which passed through the engagement site around midnight in pursuit, but failed to locate &quot;Kormoran&quot;, and returned that morning to collect a third lifeboat carrying seven survivors. These sailors stated their attacker had fired on the other two lifeboats, a claim not made by those rescued by the Germans. The Allies initially assumed that was responsible, but after this was disproven, the Admiralty was unable to determine the identity of the attacker.

Just after 1pm on 29 January, &quot;Kormoran&quot; encountered a large merchantman which altered course on sighting the raider, but returned to her original heading after &quot;Kormoran&quot; made no aggressive moves. Detmers instead waited until the distance between the ships had decreased before the raider altered course to intercept, dropped her camouflage, and ordered the merchantman to stop. The ship did not comply, and after a warning shot elicited no response, &quot;Kormoran&quot; fired for effect. A distress signal was transmitted but jammed by the raider, and after unsuccessfully trying to break away from the faster German ship, the merchant vessel came to a stop and ceased attempts to transmit. The crew was ordered by signals from &quot;Kormoran&quot; to abandon ship, but the merchant sailors did not comply until after the raider resumed fire, having observed an attempt to man the ship&#x27;s stern gun. A boarding party identified the victim as the 11,900-ton refrigerator ship &quot;Afric Star&quot;, carrying meat and butter to England. The complicated configuration and damaged condition of &quot;Afric Star&quot; ruled against her capture as a prize ship; after confiscating code books and other vital documents, and recovering 76 people, including two women, attempts were made to scuttle her. The merchantman refused to sink, and &quot;Kormoran&quot; had to use shells and torpedoes to send her to the bottom at .

Later that day, lookouts aboard the raider spotted a merchant ship sailing without lights. Sneaking up on the vessel, &quot;Kormoran&quot; opened fire; her first salvo missed, but within minutes, the target was heavily damaged and aflame. The ship transmitted a distress signal, which &quot;Kormoran&quot; was unable to jam completely, but this ceased as crew members started to abandon ship. The raider stopped firing, but resumed when the merchantman attempted another transmission, and shore stations responded. Communications intercepts and the code books taken from &quot;Afric Star&quot; earlier that day revealed the target&#x27;s identity: the 5,273-ton British freighter &quot;Eurylochus&quot;, with a cargo of bombers for the Gold Coast. These intercepts also indicated that several parties, including the Air Ministry, were aware of the attack, prompting Detmers to order the torpedoing of &quot;Eurylochus&quot;. This was accomplished with a single torpedo, sinking the British ship and her cargo at , three and a half hours after &quot;Afric Star&quot;. 39 Chinese and four British crew were recovered by the German raider before she fled the area with British warships and in pursuit. Another 28 survivors were found by the Spanish merchant ship &quot;Monte Tiede&quot; later that night, with 10 men killed during the attack or lost at sea. &quot;Eurylochus&quot;″ master was among those rescued by the Allies, and recounted that two ships had attacked, one of them armed with guns, which led British Naval Intelligence to conclude that the responsible ships were &quot;Thor&quot; and , or an unknown raider operating in concert with one of these. Among the rescued was ship&#x27;s gunner Frank Laskier who, on returning to England, was interviewed by BBC radio and proved so popular he became a figurehead for Merchant Navy enlistment propaganda for the rest of the war.

After evading pursuit, &quot;Kormoran&quot; made for a point off the Cape Verde Islands, where she rendezvoused with the supply ship on 7 February. During a three-day replenishment operation, &quot;Kormoran&quot; topped up &quot;Nordmark&quot;″s supply of spare U-boat parts with components brought from Germany, and transferred 170 of the 174 prisoners acquired so far. The four Chinese sailors from &quot;Eurylochus&quot; were hired to stay aboard the raider as laundrymen, and the &quot;British Union&quot; crew left their pet monkey aboard as thanks for their treatment while in captivity. A piano was taken from &quot;Nordmark&quot;″s companion &quot;Duquesa&quot;, a captured coal-burning ship that was to be scuttled when her fuel ran out, but Detmers warned that if the piano caused any problems among the crew, it would be pushed overboard.

&quot;Kormoran&quot; left the rendezvous on 10 February and headed south. During the transit, Detmers received a signal from Germany indicating that his ship had been awarded two First Class Iron Crosses, and 50 Second Class Iron Crosses, to be distributed as he saw fit. Detmers transmitted a request on 18 February for WM-80 white metal (Babbitt (metal)), as the softer WM-10 used in bearings for two of the four diesel engines were wearing out too quickly. Some metal was acquired from the raider on 25 February, but this was not enough to replace all the bearings. On 15 March, &quot;Kormoran&quot; met to transfer torpedoes, provisions, and spare parts, but rough seas forced the two vessels to head south, where they met a day later. The raider&#x27;s broken radar and a sailor with an eye injury were transferred to , but attempts to replenish the U-boat were again interrupted by bad weather, forcing the two vessels to relocate again. The equipment transfer and refueling took another three days, during which crewmen from &quot;U-124&quot; enjoyed the relatively luxurious facilities aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot;, and a sick sailor from the submarine was traded for a healthy man from the raider.

&quot;Kormoran&quot; sailed north to the Freetown-South America shipping route, and began to patrol near where it intersected the border of the Pan-American Security Zone. On the morning of 22 March, the raider encountered a tanker, which identified herself as the British vessel &quot;Agnita&quot;. &quot;Kormoran&quot; instructed her to stop and maintain wireless silence or be fired upon. The tanker instead broke away and began to transmit a distress signal, which was jammed as &quot;Kormoran&quot; opened fire. &quot;Agnita&quot; signaled surrender after two salvoes; 12 British and 25 Chinese sailors were captured, along with maps of the minefields surrounding Freetown Harbour. Efforts to scuttle the tanker failed, and &quot;Kormoran&quot; had to waste another torpedo to sink the ship at .

Against usual practice, Detmers decided to return to the site of the action three days later, where another tanker was spotted. &quot;Kormoran&quot; revealed her weapons and fired a warning shot at the tanker, which initially attempted to flee but then chose to surrender when the morning mist lifted and revealed the nature of her attacker. The 11,309-ton (German-built) Canadian tanker was taken as a prize ship, with a German crew taking the ship and her 44 sailors to Bordeaux, France, while the four officers were imprisoned aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot;. After the captured tanker left, it was realised recognition signals to avoid attack had not been supplied, and &quot;Kormoran&quot; raced to meet the tanker when she rendezvoused with the supply ship &quot;Nordmark&quot;. The raider met the supply ship on 27 March, but it appeared &quot;Canadolite&quot; had enough fuel to reach France and had chosen to sail straight there. Two U-boats were scheduled to reach the rendezvous point for resupply; Detmers suggested he meet , which was carrying more white metal for &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s engines, while &quot;Nordmark&quot; focused on . The commanding officer of &quot;U-105&quot; agreed to transmit a warning to Germany regarding &quot;Canadolite&quot; once the U-boat had left the rendezvous point, which did not occur until six days later because of equipment problems delaying the replenishment. The tanker arrived safely on 13 April, was renamed , and remained operational until her sinking by the Royal Air Force in 1944.

&quot;Kormoran&quot; was due to rendezvous with the tanker on 4 April, and had no opportunity to search for new targets. The 42 prisoners from &quot;Kormoran&quot; were transferred to the &quot;Rudolf Albrecht&quot;, but as she was a civilian vessel, her master was sworn in by Detmers as a naval officer, and an armed guard had to be supplied. Detmers ordered the transfer of four men from &quot;Nordmark&quot; to &quot;Rudolf Albrecht&quot; as guards, along with a fifth to &quot;Kormoran&quot; in exchange for the sick sailor taken from &quot;U-124&quot; two weeks before. The supply ship&#x27;s commander attempted to obstruct the transfers, and then demanded replacements; one came from &quot;Kormoran&quot;, while three of the tanker&#x27;s sailors were drafted. Food, mail, and newspapers were received from &quot;Rudolf Albrecht&quot;, along with news that another three First Class Iron Crosses and 50 Second Class Iron Crosses had been awarded to &quot;Kormoran&quot;.

Having returned to the waters off Freetown, &quot;Kormoran&quot; encountered a merchant ship at dawn on 9 April. As the ship was behind &quot;Kormoran&quot; and on a similar course, the raider slowed until the merchantman was abeam of the raider and to port. The German ship dropped her camouflage, increased speed, and ordered the freighter to stop or be fired upon. In response, the merchantman attempted to transmit a distress call (which was jammed by &quot;Kormoran&quot;) and tried to man her stern gun, prompting the Germans to open fire. The freighter took heavy damage, as every time Detmers ordered or was about to order a cease-fire, the target ship attempted to escape or transmit another distress signal. Eventually, the 46 survivors of the crew (five were killed in the attack) abandoned their burning vessel, and boarding parties were sent from the raider. She was identified as the 8,022-ton British freighter &quot;Craftsman&quot;, carrying an anti-submarine net for Singapore, which was to be delivered after a stop in Cape Town. After scuttling charges failed to sink &quot;Craftsman&quot;, she was torpedoed at .

After fleeing the scene, &quot;Kormoran&quot; headed south, and early on 12 April encountered another ship. After slowly closing on the merchantman over three hours, &quot;Kormoran&quot; de-camouflaged and fired several warning shots. The freighter turned away and sent a distress signal; wireless operators aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot; were unable to jam it, but there was little concern as the transmission was an SOS instead of the more specific QQQ or RRR for a raider attack, while also giving the wrong coordinates. &quot;Kormoran&quot; fired for effect, but it was not until the merchant ship&#x27;s bridge was destroyed that her 35 crew abandoned ship. A boarding party identified the ship as the 5,486-ton Greek freighter &quot;Nicholas D.L.&quot;, carrying Canadian timber. Because of her buoyant cargo, the scuttling charges failed to have major effect, but after firing some shells into &quot;Nicholas D.L.&quot;, Detmers chose to leave the ship to sink slowly at . Until 1943, the Admiralty accepted the SOS location, 18° further north, as fact, while attributing the sinking to the raider .

On 17 April, &quot;Kormoran&quot; sighted a passenger ship, but was unable to lure her into range before the vessel disappeared into a rain squall. Two days later, &quot;Kormoran&quot; met &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the blockade runner &quot;Dresden&quot;. An expected shipment of white metal for &quot;Kormoran&quot; had been supplied to a different blockade runner, which was delayed. Several supply ships arrived at the rendezvous point over the next few days and transferred provisions, ammunition, and fuel to the raider. Prisoners from &quot;Kormoran&quot; were handed over to the other ships, and the raider received new sailors to make up numbers. &quot;Kormoran&quot; departed on 22 April, and spent two days changing her disguise to the Japanese freighter before sailing into the Indian Ocean.

=== Indian Ocean ===
On reaching the Indian Ocean, &quot;Kormoran&quot; was immediately diverted to refuel the whaling ship &quot;Adjutant&quot; and supply ship ; refuelling was carried out between 13 and 17 May. Although originally confined to waters northeast of latitude 20°S and longitude 80°E, the raider&#x27;s area of operations expanded on 1 June to encompass the entire ocean. The ship&#x27;s disguise was altered again on 5 June, with &quot;Kormoran&quot; taking the identity of the Japanese merchant ship &quot;Kinka Maru&quot;, as the owners of &quot;Sakito Maru&quot; rarely operated in the western Indian. After patrolling around the Maldives without success, &quot;Kormoran&quot; sailed towards the Bay of Bengal with plans to lay mines in the approaches to Madras and Calcutta. Although a target was spotted en route on 15 June, the raider&#x27;s smoke generator malfunctioned and started to produce thick, black smoke, which scared off the merchantman. On 24 June, while approaching Madras, the raider was spotted and shadowed by what the Germans assumed was a British auxiliary cruiser. The suspicious ship later resumed her original course without incident, but Detmers decided to postpone the mine-laying operation and leave the area, as Allied forces would become suspicious when the &quot;Japanese&quot; ship failed to reach port.

During the early morning of 26 June, a darkened merchant ship was spotted. Signals were sent to the ship without response, and after the merchantman appeared to ignore a warning shot, &quot;Kormoran&quot; opened fire and caused massive damage. Nine men, identifying themselves as crew from the 4,153-ton Yugoslavian cargo ship &quot;Velebit&quot;, were recovered from a lifeboat; the lack of response was attributed to the actions of inexperienced Indian sailors taken on in Bombay. The ship was left to sink, but another eight sailors remained on board, and kept &quot;Velebit&quot; afloat until she ran aground on the reefs surrounding the Andaman Islands. That afternoon, smoke from another ship was spotted by &quot;Kormoran&quot;. Maintaining a steady course away from the merchantman until a rain squall enveloped the raider, &quot;Kormoran&quot; then altered onto a converging course, and closed to within before crossing the merchantman&#x27;s bow to reach a favorable firing position and revealing her identity. Orders to stop were ignored, and the raider opened fire after a distress call was sent. Within 30 seconds, shells from the raider destroyed the merchantman&#x27;s wireless room and forecastle, damaged the engine room, and started several fires. Some 48 sailors from the 3,472-ton Australian vessel &quot;Mareeba&quot; were recovered by &quot;Kormoran&quot;, and although a boarding party attempted to save the ship for use as a mine-layer, the severity of damage made this impossible. The Australian ship was scuttled, and sank quickly at .

After retreating to open waters, a 15-day overhaul of the engines was carried out. While working on one of the seaplanes, a sailor was killed by electrocution. &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s disguise was changed to the Dutch freighter , and notice was received of a further 100 Second Class Iron Crosses and five First Class Iron Crosses awarded to the ship. On completion, Detmers set course for the Bay of Bengal intending to lay a second mine field, but aborted this on 30 July when he learned the aircraft carrier would be in the area. &quot;Kormoran&quot; then took to patrolling the shipping routes from Fremantle to Colombo or Lombok. A merchant ship was spotted near sunset on 13 August, but the ship&#x27;s actions (which included heading directly for &quot;Kormoran&quot; on spotting her, broadcasting a raider distress call without coordinates, and repeatedly broadcasting homing signals) caused Detmers to think the target was either an Allied auxiliary cruiser or was attempting to lure &quot;Kormoran&quot; into range of an Allied warship. &quot;Kormoran&quot; broke off pursuit and retreated. The raider continued to search for ships without success. On 25 August, the lookout spotted a strange object on the horizon; this was worked out to be the peak of on Enggano Island, and the first sighting of land in 258 days.

&quot;Kormoran&quot; then moved to waters south of Ceylon, and around midday on 1 September, a large vessel, which Detmers determined to be an unaccompanied troopship, was spotted. Plans were made to attack that night, but the transport disappeared over the horizon during the afternoon and could not be relocated. Two days later, Detmers was informed that &quot;Kormoran&quot; would be replaced by at the end of December, and that he would be resupplied by the supply ship , which had come from Japan and would wait for the raider at a predetermined rendezvous point from 12 October. Late on 23 September, the navigational lights for a ship were sighted. After signalling the merchant ship for her name and nationality, which identified her as the 3,941-ton Greek freighter &quot;Stamatios G. Embiricus&quot;, the raider shone searchlights on her and ordered her to stop and accept a boarding party. Those aboard the Greek ship assumed they were being pulled up by a British warship for not observing blackout regulations, and it was not until the armed Germans arrived on the ship that the nature of the &quot;Kormoran&quot; was revealed. Although captured intact, &quot;Stamantios G. Embiricus&quot; was a coal-fuelled ship, and did not have enough fuel to reach any destination other than her intended port, Colombo. The ship was scuttled at , but while a lifeboat carrying the ship&#x27;s master and five crew rowed to &quot;Kormoran&quot;, a second lifeboat carrying the other 24 avoided capture in the dark. A search using one of the Arado seaplanes found them late the next morning.

A few days later, &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s wireless operators intercepted transmissions between the Norwegian tanker &quot;Thelma&quot; and a shore stationinitially in a new code, then repeated in a recently expired code. This allowed the Germans to identify where the merchant ship was heading to, and make some progress on breaking the new code. However, the tanker could have taken several routes to her Cape Town destination, and &quot;Kormoran&quot; did not encounter her during four days of searching. The raider then headed south, and met the supply ship &quot;Kulmerland&quot; on 16 October. Supplies and parts were transferred to &quot;Kormoran&quot;, while the raider&#x27;s prisoners were moved to &quot;Kulmerland&quot;, along with documents captured from ships and five slightly ill German sailors to serve as guards. After leaving on 24 October, maintenance and repairs were carried out. Plans were made to sail up the coast of Western Australia; the original intention was to mine shipping routes near Cape Leeuwin and Fremantle, but after wireless signals were detected from a warship (Australian heavy cruiser ) escorting a convoy in the area, Detmers decided to sail further north and mine Shark Bay, then proceed to the East Indies before looping back west to the Bay of Bengal.

== Final battle and loss ==

: &quot;Note: All times in this section are UTC+7.&quot;

On 19 November 1941, shortly before 4:00pm, &quot;Kormoran&quot; was south-west of Carnarvon. The raider was sailing northwards (heading 025°) at . At 3:55pm, what was initially thought to be a tall ship sail was sighted off the port bow, although the sighting was quickly determined to be the masts of a cruiser, . Detmers ordered &quot;Kormoran&quot; to alter course into the sun (heading 260°) at maximum achievable speed (which quickly dropped from because of problems in one of her diesels), while setting the ship to action stations. &quot;Sydney&quot; spotted the German ship around the same time, and altered from her southward heading to intercept at .
As the cruiser closed from astern, she began to send searchlight signals. The first was not answered because the Germans did not understand the coded Morse. &quot;Sydney&quot; repeated for half an hour, but then began to send, &quot;You should hoist your signal letters&quot;, both by plain-language Morse and signal flag. After another delay, &quot;Kormoran&quot; raised flags reading &quot;PKQI&quot;the callsign for her disguise, the Dutch merchant ship on the triatic stay and hoisted a Dutch civil ensign. As the cruiser was on &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s starboard quarter at , the flags were obscured by the raider&#x27;s funnel; German accounts vary as to if this was done deliberately to make the ship seem civilian, a ruse to lure &quot;Sydney&quot; closer, or the signaller&#x27;s honest mistake. After receiving an instruction from the cruiser to make the flags visible, the signals officer aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot; did so by lengthening the halyard and swinging it around to the starboard side. By 4:35pm, with &quot;Sydney&quot; away, the malfunctioning engine aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot; was repaired, but Detmers chose to keep it in reserve and maintain speed. Further flag signals were exchanged, with &quot;Sydney&quot; asking the raider&#x27;s destination and cargo.

At around 5:00pm, Detmers instructed his wireless operators to send a distress signal indicating was being approached by a suspicious ship. Transmitted at 5:03pm and repeated at 5:05pm, it contained the distress call for a merchantman under attack from a raider, rather than a warship (QQQQ as opposed to RRRR), the latitude and longitude of the transmitting ship, the time per Greenwich Mean Time instead of local time (a deliberate error to let the know a raider was likely about to be lost), and her name. This message was partially received by the tugboat &quot;Uco&quot; (&quot;QQQQ [unintelligible] 1000 GMT&quot;) and a shore station at Geraldton (&quot;[unintelligible] 7C 11115E 1000 GMT&quot;). The Geraldton station broadcast a message to all ships asking if there was anything to report, which was interpreted by the Germans as acknowledgement of their signal. During the exchanges and distress signal, &quot;Sydney&quot; positioned herself off the raider&#x27;s starboard beam on a parallel course, approximately from &quot;Kormoran&quot;. Her main guns and torpedoes trained on the raider, but secondary weapons did not appear to be manned, personnel were standing on the upper deck, and although the cruiser&#x27;s seaplane had been readied for launch, it was soon stowed away. During her manoeuvre, &quot;Sydney&quot; signalled &quot;IK&quot;, which made no sense from the Germans&#x27; perspective, as that combination was shorthand for &quot;You should prepare for a cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon&quot;. However, those two letters were part of the real ″s secret secondary callsign, and &quot;Sydney&quot; was expecting the ship to confirm her identity by responding with the callsign&#x27;s other two letters.

Fifteen minutes later, the cruiser signalled, &quot;Show your secret sign&quot;. Detmers knew there was no chance of fooling &quot;Sydney&quot; for much longer, so ordered &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s disguise dropped, the German battle ensign raised, and for all weapons to commence firing. The raider&#x27;s opening salvo bracketed the ship, while the next four salvoes destroyed &quot;Sydney&quot;″s bridge, gun direction tower, forward turrets, and aircraft. Two torpedoes were launched simultaneously with the raider&#x27;s attack, and the close proximity of the target allowed the use of lighter weapons to rake &quot;Sydney&quot;″s flank and interfere with attempts to man the cruiser&#x27;s secondary weapons. In contrast, &quot;Sydney&quot; was only able to fire a single full salvo before her forward turrets were knocked out, shells from which punched through &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s exhaust funnel and wireless room, and caused shrapnel wounds to two sailors. &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s gunners shifted their aim to &quot;Sydney&quot;″s waterline with their next three salvoes. &quot;Sydney&quot; responded from her aft turrets: one damaged the raider&#x27;s machinery spaces and started a fire in an oil tank, while the other fired only a few ineffective shells. Around the time of the eighth or ninth German salvo, one of &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s torpedoes struck &quot;Sydney&quot; forward of &quot;A&quot; turret, ripping a hole in her side and causing her to settle by the bow. After the torpedo hit, &quot;Sydney&quot; turned hard to port in what the Germans assumed was an attempt to ram, but the cruiser passed harmlessly aft.

By 5:35pm, the cruiser was heading south, heavily damaged, on fire, and losing speed, with her main guns destroyed or jammed facing away from their target and her secondary weapons out of range. &quot;Kormoran&quot; maintained her course and speed, but discontinued salvo firing; her stern guns continued to score hits as &quot;Sydney&quot; passed through their firing arcs. The cruiser fired torpedoes at &quot;Kormoran&quot;, but as the raider was turning to bring her port broadside to bear, these passed harmlessly astern. After completing the turn, battle damage caused &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s engines to fail completely, leaving the raider dead in the water while &quot;Sydney&quot; continued to limp southwards. Despite being immobilised, &quot;Kormoran&quot; continued to fire at a high ratesome of the German sailors reported that up to 450 shells were used during the second phase of the battleand scored hits on the cruiser, although misses would have increased as the range grew. The raider fired her guns for the last time around 5:50pm, with the range at , and a torpedo was fired at 6:00pm, but missed.

By the end of the half-hour engagement, the ships were about apart, with both heavily damaged and on fire. Damage to &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s engine room had knocked out the fire-fighting systems, and as it was only a matter of time until the oil fire reached the magazines or mine hold, Detmers ordered &quot;abandon ship&quot; at 6:25pm. All boats and rafts were launched by 9:00pm, during which a skeleton crew kept the weapons manned while their colleagues evacuated and the officers made preparations for scuttling. During all this, &quot;Sydney&quot; was seen to proceed south-southeast at low speed; she disappeared over the horizon shortly after the engagement, but the glow of the burning ship was seen on the horizon consistently until 10:00pm, and sporadically until midnight.

&quot;Kormoran&quot; was abandoned and scuttled at midnight; she sank slowly until the mine hold exploded half an hour later. The German survivors were in five boats and two rafts: one cutter carrying 46 men, two battle-damaged steel life rafts with 57 and 62 aboard (the latter carrying Detmers and towing several small floats), one workboat carrying 72, one boat with 31 aboard, and two rafts, each bearing 26. During the evacuation, a rubber liferaft carrying 60, mostly wounded, sank without warning; the three survivors were placed in other boats. Total German casualties were six officers, 75 German sailors, and one Chinese sailor.

=== Rescue ===

The first life raft of German survivors, carrying 26 men, was recovered by the troopship &quot;Aquitania&quot; early on 23 November, but as the ship&#x27;s master believed a raider was still in the area, he maintained wireless silence and did not report his discovery until three days later. The lifeboat carrying Detmers saw the troopship but did not make their presence known, as the German officer hoped to be picked up by a neutral merchant ship.

Attempts to locate &quot;Sydney&quot;, which was several days overdue in returning to port, commenced on 23 November. However, it was not until the afternoon of the next day, after the British tanker &quot;Trocas&quot; reported finding the second &quot;Kormoran&quot; life raft with 25 men (one having perished) a full-scale search was begun. Several German lifeboats were spotted on 25 November during the air search off Western Australia: the 46-man cutter had come ashore at 17-Mile Well, the 57-man lifeboat was nearing Red Bluff, and a third lifeboat was further off the coast. That afternoon, the staff of Quobba Station rounded up the two groups that had made landfall, who did not resist capture.

The 31-man boat was recovered by the passenger ship just before sunset on 26 November. The passenger-freighter , which had been instructed to make landfall at Carnarvon to collect the Germans captured so far and transport them to Fremantle, encountered Detmers&#x27; lifeboat that night at 10:00pm and took it in tow, as they were unwilling to let 62 enemy naval personnel aboard, but did not want to leave them to their fate. During the voyage to Carnarvon, the damaged and overloaded German lifeboat was swamped, and the &quot;Kormoran&quot; survivors were transferred into two of &quot;Centaur&quot;″s lifeboats. Arriving in Carnarvon on the afternoon of 27 November, the Germans were relocated from the boats to &quot;Centaur&quot;″s number one cargo hold, where they were joined by the sailors from the two lifeboats that had reached shore and 40 Australian Army guards.

The last boat, carrying 70 Germans and two Chinese, was spotted from the air during the late morning of 27 November, and was recovered shortly afterward by . The next day, recovered a German lifebelt and two four-man liferafts, one of which was carrying a deceased German sailor, who was buried at sea. The search was terminated at sunset on 29 November. By this point, all of the German lifeboats were accounted for, and 318 of &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s 399 personnel (including three of the four Chinese laundry workers) had survived.

During searches in late 1941, none of the 645-strong ship&#x27;s company from &quot;Sydney&quot; was found; the only confirmed remains found were a damaged carley float and a lifebelt. In February 1942, a carley float carrying a then-unidentifiable body reached Christmas Island. In 2021, familial DNA research verified that the remains were those of Able Seaman Thomas Welsby Clark, an ASDIC (sonar) operator on &quot;Sydney&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===

In Germany, information about the battle was assembled from communications intercepts during the search for survivors, then combined with Allied news articles and published in early 1943 for internal consumption by German officials. A member of &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s crew sent home in a prisoner exchange later that year confirmed the details of the battle, and accounts were published by the German media in December 1943.

Most of the German survivors were taken to Fremantle and interrogated. Attempts to learn what had happened were hampered by the German officers instructing their sailors to obfuscate the enemy with false answers, people describing events they did not witness but heard of later, and difficulty in keeping groups separated in order to check their stories against each other. Despite this, Australian authorities were able to piece together the broad details of the battle, which was verified by German sailors recovered by &quot;Aquitania&quot; who had been taken to Sydney instead. Their interviews showed similar commonalities and inconsistencies as those in Fremantle, and the interrogators concluded that the true story was being recounted.

Initially, the sailors were imprisoned at Harvey while the officers were imprisoned at Swanbourne Barracks, but after interrogations were concluded in December, they were all relocated to prisoner-of-war camps near Murchison, Victoria. Sailors were interned in No. 13 Prisoner of War Camp, which already hosted 1,200 soldiers of the , and their shipmates rescued by &quot;Aquitania&quot;, while officers were sent to the Dhurringile homestead. One sailor died in captivity on 24 March 1942 from lung cancer, and was buried in the Tatura war cemetery. On 11 January 1945, Detmers and nineteen other Axis officers broke out from Dhurringile through a tunnel excavated during the previous seven months, although all were recaptured within days of escaping. Detmers was found with a German-English dictionary which included two accounts of the battle (a deck log or action report, and an engineering log) encrypted within using a Vigenère cipher, although these accounts provided little new information. Shortly after returning to the camp, Detmers suffered a stroke, and spent over three months at the military hospital in Heidelberg, Victoria.

The German officers and sailors were repatriated almost two years after the war with Germany had ended, departing from Port Phillip with other Axis prisoners aboard the steamer on 21 February 1947. Ironically, tied up to the opposite pier was the real . On arrival in Cuxhaven, the prisoners were searched before leaving the ship, and while several written reports were gathered, none provided new information.

== Search and rediscovery ==

Despite the approximate last position of &quot;Kormoran&quot; being known (most German accounts giving the battle coordinates as ), efforts to find &quot;Kormoran&quot; and &quot;Sydney&quot; were hampered by the size of the search area indicated by such broad coordinates, and claims by Australians that the Germans had lied about the coordinates (among other aspects of the fight) and the ships would be found further south and closer inshore.

Several searches were made by the Australian military in the years following the war, but these were primarily concerned with finding the Australian cruiser, technologically restricted to shallow waters, and made to verify or prove false civilian claims that &quot;Sydney&quot; or &quot;Kormoran&quot; was at a particular location. In 1990, Robert Ballard and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution were approached to lead a search for the ships, which he agreed to on the condition that the search area be narrowed down considerably. A forum in 1991 unsuccessfully attempted to do this, and Ballard withdrew his offer. A 1999 Australian government report recommended that a seminar be organised to identify the most likely search area for the warships, but again, participants were still split between the battle location given by the Germans (referred to as the &quot;northern position&quot;) or a point off the Abrolhos Islands (the area for the battle advocated by supporters of the &quot;southern position&quot;).

American shipwreck hunter David Mearns first learned of the battle and mutual destruction of &quot;Sydney&quot; and &quot;Kormoran&quot; during a conference in 1996, and began studying the battle in 2001. With the assistance of historians and the Western Australian Museum, Mearns focused on primary source documents, during which he discovered or rediscovered several archive files and diaries of &quot;Kormoran&quot; personnel believed lost; these documents led him to believe that the German accounts were truthful. After identifying a potential search area, the Australian government announced several million dollars of funding for the search, but German government assistance was limited to formal approval for Mearns to film &quot;Kormoran&quot; if she was found.

Mearns&#x27; plan was to determine a &#x27;search box&#x27; for &quot;Kormoran&quot; by plotting the possible starting points of the two rafts from the raider through a reverse drift analysis. This search box (which was calculated to be in size) would then be inspected over the course of several days with a deep-water, towed side-scan sonar mounted aboard the survey vessel SV &quot;Geosounder&quot;. Mearns chose to focus on finding &quot;Kormoran&quot; first, as locating the German ship would significantly narrow down the search area for &quot;Sydney&quot;. After locating one or both vessels, &quot;Geosounder&quot; would return to port and replace the sonar with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to photograph and video the wrecks, although funding limitations meant the search and inspection of both ships had to be concluded within 45 days. After problems with equipment and weather, &quot;Geosounder&quot; commenced the search, and located &quot;Kormoran&quot; during the afternoon of 12 March 2008. The wreck site was below sea level, and consisted of two large pieces apart, with an oval-shaped debris field between them, centred at . The raider&#x27;s discovery was publicly announced by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the morning of 17 March.
Mearns was then able to plot a search area for &quot;Sydney&quot; based on &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s location, as although there was no specific information on the cruiser&#x27;s location, much more information was available concerning her last known position relative to the raider. &quot;Sydney&quot; was located on 17 March at , southeast of &quot;Kormoran&quot;. Discovery of the vessel was made only hours after the locating of &quot;Kormoran&quot; was publicly announced. On discovery, both wrecks were placed under the protection of the Australian &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot;, which penalises anyone disturbing a protected shipwreck with a fine of up to A$10,000 or a maximum five years imprisonment. Both wrecks were placed on the Australian National Heritage List on 14 March 2011.

After the side-scan sonar aboard &quot;Geosounder&quot; was switched out for the ROV (again delayed by technical issues and more bad weather), she returned to sea for detailed inspections of the wrecks. &quot;Sydney&quot; was filmed and documented during 3–6 April, and a sonar contact thought to be debris from the battle was visually inspected on 6 April and found to be outcrops of pillow lava. Observation of the &quot;Kormoran&quot; wreck confirmed that the mine deck explosion had torn the stern half of the ship apart, with few recognisable items in the large debris field. The search was declared complete just before midnight on 7 April, with &quot;Geosounder&quot; returning to Geraldton.

== Awards, memorials, and legacy ==
For sinking &quot;Sydney&quot;, Detmers&#x27; Iron Cross First Class was upgraded to the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. &quot;Kormoran&quot;″s executive officer, gunnery officer, and the sailor who manned the starboard gun were awarded the Iron Cross First Class (although for the executive officer, this was a bar to a previous Iron Cross), while the other members of the crew were all awarded the Iron Cross Second Class.

The names of those killed aboard &quot;Kormoran&quot; are inscribed in the Laboe Naval Memorial where in 2011 a memorial stone commemorating both the &quot;Kormoran&quot; and the &quot;Sydney&quot; was inaugurated by Peter Tesch the former Australian ambassador to Germany. The &quot;Kormoran&quot; name was carried on by the , a &quot;Seeadler&quot; class fast attack craft of the West German Navy commissioned in 1959. This &quot;Kormoran&quot; operated until 1976, when she was sold to Greece. East Germany also operated a &quot;Kormoran&quot;; a small corvette borrowed from the Soviet Navy from 1970 to 1974.

<text>Baha Men are a Bahamian junkanoo band formed in New Providence, Bahamas in 1977. They are best known for their Grammy Award-winning hit song &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot;.

==History==

===Early years===
Baha Men formed in 1977 as High Voltage, initially playing disco and funk. They performed regularly in nightclubs and hotels in the Bahamas and self-released several albums.

In 1991, one of their tapes found its way to Atlantic Records A&amp;R man Steve Greenberg, who signed the band to the Big Beat subsidiary, at the same time getting the band to change their name to the Baha Men.

===Early success===
The following year, Baha Men released their first album, &quot;Junkanoo,&quot; which included the local hit &quot;Back to the Island&quot;. &quot;Kalik&quot; followed in 1994, including the international hit &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot;. The band moved with Greenberg to Polygram for the 1997 album &quot;I Like What I Like&quot; and &quot;Doong Spank&quot;, released the following year. The latter sold only 700 copies in the US and the band was dropped by the label.

Greenberg then started his own label, S-Curve, and signed the band. Original vocalist Nehemiah Hield left in 1999, and was replaced by his nephew Omerit. The band was most popular in the 1990s in Japan, and their 1999 album &quot;2 Zero 0-0&quot; was initially only released in that country.

===&quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot;===
They achieved great, but short-lived, popularity with a 2000s remake of &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot; (originally composed by Anslem Douglas), produced by Greenberg and Michael Mangini. The song was a chart success in many countries and also became a popular song at US sporting events. &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot; also earned the band several awards: a Grammy Award in 2001 for Best Dance Recording; &quot;Billboard Music Awards&quot; for World Music Artist of the Year and World Music Album of the Year; and a Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award for Favorite Song. In 2002, they won another Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Favorite Band.

In June 2008, &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot; was discussed on &quot;I Love the New Millennium&quot;. The Baha Men&#x27;s most recent album was &quot;Ride With Me&quot;, released in 2015.

===Recent years===

After releasing &quot;Night &amp; Day&quot; in the summer of 2014 for the FIFA World Cup that year in Brazil and was featured in the soundtrack: One Love, One Rhythm – The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Album in the Carnival Mix, the Baha Men released a Christmas Medley mixing &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; with &quot;Silver Bells&quot;. Their single &quot;Off the Leash&quot; was released digitally on 1 July 2015. On 25 October 2015, the band performed the halftime show for the New York Giants/Dallas Cowboys football game at MetLife Stadium.

In 2018, the group joined Our Last Night for a metal cover of their hit song &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot; and, in April 2019, released a new single, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, dedicated to the teams playing in the Final Four.

==TV and film appearances==

Baha Men appeared in a special scene from &quot;Between the Lions&quot; where Leona and Theo meet them while reading some books inside the library.
They performed the theme song of the Playhouse Disney series &quot;Stanley&quot;, titled &quot;My Man Stanley&quot;.

Their track “Coconut” appeared in an episode of the Nickelodeon series ChalkZone, which also featured a parodied version of the band.

They performed onstage for a Season 14 episode of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, which took place in the Bahamas.

Their track &quot;Holla!&quot; appeared in the opening and closing credits of &quot;&quot;, and during one scene in the 2005 film &quot;Kicking &amp; Screaming&quot;. 

Their track &quot;Best Years of Our Lives&quot; appeared in the rolling credits of Shrek.

Their track &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; appeared in the rolling credits of The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course.

Their track &quot;Scooby D&quot; appeared in Scooby-Doo.

The band made an appearance on the big screen, when they starred as themselves in the 1994 romantic comedy &quot;My Father the Hero,&quot; starring Gérard Depardieu and Katherine Heigl.

<doc id="182512" wikidata="Q709138" url="?curid=182512" title="Greg Maddux">
<text>Gregory Alan Maddux (born April 14, 1966), also known as &quot;Mad Dog&quot; and &quot;the Professor,&quot; is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily with the Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs. He won the 1995 World Series with the Braves over the Cleveland Indians. Maddux was the first pitcher in MLB history to win the Cy Young Award four consecutive years (1992–1995), matched by only one other pitcher, Randy Johnson. During those four seasons, Maddux had a 75–29 record with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA), while allowing less than one baserunner per inning.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history, Maddux is the only pitcher in MLB history to win at least 15 games for 17 straight seasons. He also holds the record for most Gold Gloves by any player with 18, and most putouts by a pitcher with 546, including a tied live-ball-era record of 39 putouts in a season (1990, 1991, 1993). A superb control pitcher, Maddux won more games during the 1990s than any other pitcher and is 8th on the all-time career wins list with 355. Only Warren Spahn (363) recorded more career wins than Maddux since the start of the post-1920 live-ball era. Maddux also has the most wins among pitchers who made their debuts after World War II. He is one of only ten pitchers ever to achieve both 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts, and is the only pitcher to record more than 300 wins, more than 3,000 strikeouts, and fewer than 1,000 walks (exactly 999 walks overall).

Since his retirement as a player, Maddux has also served as a special assistant to the general manager for both the Cubs and Texas Rangers. In 2014, he was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving 97.2% of the votes. In 2012, writer Jason Lukehart coined the term &quot;Maddux&quot; to describe when a pitcher throws a complete game shutout in fewer than 100 pitches; Maddux holds the record for most times accomplishing this feat (13) since pitch counts began to be tracked in 1988. The runner-up for this accomplishment is Zane Smith with seven such games. 

==Early life==
Maddux was born in San Angelo, Texas, and spent much of his childhood in Madrid, Spain, where the United States Air Force stationed his father. His father exposed him to baseball at an early age. Upon his return to Las Vegas, Nevada, Maddux and his brother Mike, who became a pro player himself, trained under the supervision of Ralph Meder, a former scout from the majors. Meder preached the value of movement and location above velocity, and advised throwing softer when in a jam instead of harder. Maddux would later say, &quot;I believed it. I don&#x27;t know why. I just did.&quot;

Though Meder died before Maddux graduated from Valley High School in Las Vegas in 1984, he instilled a firm foundation that would anchor Maddux&#x27;s future career. At Valley High, he was teammates on the school&#x27;s baseball team with future Major League pitcher Steve Chitren and helped lead the school to a state championship as a junior in 1983. While in Las Vegas, he played American Legion Baseball with Post 8. He was named the organization&#x27;s Graduate of the Year in 1984.

His brother, Mike, was drafted in 1982. When scouts went to observe the elder Maddux, their father, Dave, told them, &quot;You will be back later for the little one.&quot; Some baseball scouts were unimpressed by Maddux&#x27;s skinny build, but Chicago Cubs scout Doug Mapson saw past the physique. Mapson wrote a glowing review that read in part, &quot;I really believe this boy would be the number one player in the country if only he looked a bit more physical.&quot;

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs (1986–1992)===
The Chicago Cubs selected Maddux in the second round of the 1984 Major League Baseball draft and he chose to sign in lieu of honoring a commitment to play college baseball at the University of Arizona. He made his major league debut on September 3, 1986, the conclusion of the September 2 game which had been postponed due to darkness (lights were not installed at Wrigley Field until 1988). At the time, Maddux was the youngest player in the majors. His first appearance in a major league game was as a pinch runner (for catcher Jody Davis) in the 17th inning against the Houston Astros. Maddux then pitched in the 18th inning, allowing a home run to Billy Hatcher and taking the loss. His first start, five days later, was a complete game win. In his fifth and final start of 1986, Maddux defeated his older brother, who was pitching for the Philadelphia Phillies, marking the first time rookie brothers had pitched against each other. Mike Maddux was well used to his younger brother&#x27;s competitive spirit, saying of their youth, &quot;If Greg couldn&#x27;t win, he didn&#x27;t want to play, plain and simple.&quot; 

In 1987, his first full season in the majors, Maddux struggled significantly. Entering his start on July 8 against the San Diego Padres, Maddux was warned that if he did not get the win in what was his eighteenth start of the season, he would be sent back to Triple-A. In the bottom of the third inning, Padres starter Eric Show hit Cubs star Andre Dawson in the face with a pitch and triggered a bench clearing brawl. In the home dugout, Maddux had made up his mind that he would retaliate when the Padres came to bat. However, since this would almost certainly result in his ejection from the game and an automatic no decision since the game was not official yet, Cubs ace Rick Sutcliffe tried to talk Maddux out of what he was planning by reminding him of his impending demotion. Sutcliffe recalled Maddux looking back at him with tears in his eyes, saying that he did not care; with two outs in the top of the fourth, Maddux got his revenge by hitting Padres catcher Benito Santiago. Although he was ejected, the Cubs kept Maddux on the roster for several weeks before sending him down; he was quickly recalled after going undefeated in three starts for the Iowa Cubs with an ERA of 0.98, but finished his initial season in Chicago with six wins against fourteen losses and an ERA above 5.00.

Maddux rebounded to make his first All-Star appearance in 1988, winning eighteen games, and then established himself as the Cubs&#x27; ace in 1989, winning 19 games, including a September game at Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Stadium that clinched the Cubs&#x27; second-ever National League Eastern Division championship. Manager Don Zimmer tabbed him to start Game One of the National League Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants. He allowed eight runs and was relieved after surrendering Will Clark&#x27;s grand slam with two outs in the fourth. Maddux believed that just before the grand slam, when Maddux had a conversation with Zimmer, Clark watched, read Maddux&#x27;s lips (Maddux said, &quot;Fastball, high, inside), and so knew what pitch to expect. After that incident, Maddux always covered his mouth with his glove during conversations on the mound. Maddux took a no-decision in Game Four; the Cubs ended up losing the NLCS four-games-to-one.

After consecutive 15-win seasons in 1990 and 1991, Maddux won 20 games in 1992, tied for the NL lead, and was voted his first National League Cy Young Award. Free agency was pending for Maddux, but contract talks with the Cubs became contentious and eventually ceased. Both Chicago general manager Larry Himes and Maddux&#x27;s agent, Scott Boras, accused the other of failing to negotiate in good faith. The Cubs eventually decided to pursue other free agents, including José Guzmán, Dan Plesac, and Candy Maldonado. After seven seasons in Chicago, Maddux signed a five-year, $28 million deal with the Atlanta Braves.

===Atlanta Braves (1993–2003)===
Maddux made his debut with the Braves on April 5, 1993, as their opening day starter against the Cubs at Wrigley Field, beating his former teammates 1–0. He finished the regular season with a 20–10 record, led the NL with a 2.36 ERA, and won his second straight Cy Young Award. The Braves took their rotation of Maddux, 22-game winner Tom Glavine, 18-game winner Steve Avery, and 15-game winner John Smoltz to the postseason. Maddux won against the Philadelphia Phillies in Game Two of the NLCS, but with Atlanta trailing 3 games to 2, lost the decisive Game Six.

During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Maddux posted an ERA of 1.56, the second-lowest since Bob Gibson&#x27;s historic 1.12 in 1968, the last year of the elevated mound, and the lowest in the majors since Dwight Gooden&#x27;s 1.53 in 1985. It pleased Maddux that his 1994 batting average (.222) was higher than his ERA. Maddux also led the National League in wins (with 16) and innings pitched (202) in his third Cy Young-winning year. Maddux also finished 5th in National League Most Valuable Player voting in 1994.

In the 1995 season, Maddux was 19–2 and he posted the third-lowest ERA since Gibson&#x27;s: 1.63. Maddux became the first pitcher to post back-to-back ERAs under 1.80 since Walter Johnson in 1918 (1.27) and 1919 (1.49). Maddux&#x27;s 1.63 ERA came in a year when the overall league ERA was 4.23. Since the beginning of the live-ball era in 1920, there have only been five pitchers to have full-season ERAs under 1.65: Gibson and Luis Tiant in the anomalous 1968 season, Gooden in 1985, and Maddux, twice. Maddux&#x27;s 19 wins led the National League, for the third time in four seasons.

On May 28, 1995, he beat the Astros, losing a no-hitter on an eighth-inning home run to Jeff Bagwell. It was the only nine-inning one-hitter of his career. In June and July, Maddux threw 51 consecutive innings without issuing a walk. Maddux pitched effectively in all three of the Braves&#x27;s postseason series, winning a game in each. His Game One victory in the 1995 World Series involved nine innings, two hits, no walks, and no earned runs with Orel Hershiser pitching for the Cleveland Indians. Maddux took the loss in Game Five, but the Atlanta Braves won their first World Series championship two days later. Following the 1995 season, Maddux won his fourth straight Cy Young Award, a major league record, and his second consecutive unanimous award. Maddux also finished third in that year&#x27;s National League Most Valuable Player voting. The Atlanta Braves also made good on a pre-season promise to their pitching rotation, installing a putting green in the locker room at the newly built Turner Field following the World Series victory.

From 1996 to 1998, Maddux finished fifth, second, and fourth in the Cy Young voting. In August 1997, Maddux signed a $57.5-million, five-year contract extension that made him the highest-paid player in baseball. In February 2003, he avoided arbitration by signing a one-year $14.75-million deal. Maddux&#x27;s production remained consistent: a 19–4 record in 1997, 18–9 in 1998, 19–9 in both 1999 and 2000, 17–11 in 2001, 16–6 in 2002, and 16–11 in 2003, his last season as a Brave. From 1993 to 1998, Maddux led the National League in ERA four times, and was second the other two seasons.

On July 22, 1997, Maddux threw a complete game with just 78 pitches (36 strikes, 20 batted balls, 13 balls, 5 hits, and 4 fouls) against the Cubs. Three weeks earlier, he had shut out the defending champion New York Yankees on 84 pitches, and five days before that he had beaten the Phillies with a 90-pitch complete game. Maddux allowed just 20 bases on balls in 1997, including six intentional walks.

Maddux struck out 200+ batters for the only time in his career in 1998. He outdueled the Cubs&#x27; Kerry Wood to clinch the NLDS, but the Braves were eliminated in the next round. The Braves returned to the World Series in 1999. Maddux was the Game One starter, and took a 1–0 lead into the eighth inning before a Yankee rally cost him the game and eventually the series as the Braves were swept.

On June 14, 2000, Maddux made his 387th putout to break Jack Morris&#x27;s career record. In September 2000, he had a streak of 40 scoreless innings. He pitched poorly in his one playoff start of 2000. In May 2001, Maddux became the first Braves pitcher since 1916 to throw two 1–0 shutouts in the same month. The first included a career-best 14 strikeouts. In July and August of that year, Maddux pitched 72 consecutive innings without giving up a walk; that streak ended when he intentionally threw four balls to Steve Finley. In 2002, he won his 13th straight Gold Glove Award, a NL record. Maddux tied Jim Kaat&#x27;s career record of 16 Gold Gloves after the 2006 season.

Throughout most of his years with the Braves, in the tradition of other pitching greats such as Steve Carlton, Maddux often had his own personal catcher. At various times Maddux used Charlie O&#x27;Brien, Eddie Pérez, Paul Bako, and Henry Blanco, for the majority of his starts, though regular starter Javy López did sometimes catch Maddux in the postseason.

Maddux was the crown jewel in the much-vaunted Braves trio of Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, who pitched together for over a decade as the core of one of the best pitching staffs in the history of the game. The three were the linchpin of a team that won its division (the National League West in 1993 and the East from then on) every year that Maddux was on the team (1994 had no division champions). The three pitchers were frequently augmented by other strong starters such as Steve Avery, Kevin Millwood, Denny Neagle, and Russ Ortiz. In 1995, they pitched the Braves to a World Series title. In 29 postseason games with Atlanta, Maddux had a 2.81 ERA and a 1.19 WHIP, but just an 11–13 record.

===Second stint with the Chicago Cubs (2004–2006)===
Maddux returned to the Cubs as a free agent prior to the 2004 season, when he signed with them on February 18, 2004. Maddux got his first win on April 23 after losing 3 consecutive games at the beginning of the season. On August 7, Maddux defeated the San Francisco Giants, 8–4, to garner his 300th career victory. In April 2005, he beat Roger Clemens for his 306th win in the first National League matchup between 300-game winners in 113 years. On July 26, 2005, after a three-hour rain delay, Maddux struck out Omar Vizquel to become the thirteenth member of the 3,000 strikeout club and only the ninth pitcher with both 300 wins and 3,000 strikeouts, having reached both marks against the San Francisco Giants. Maddux finished as one of the four pitchers to top 3,000 strikeouts while having allowed fewer than 1,000 walks (he had 999). The other three pitchers who have accomplished this feat are Ferguson Jenkins, Curt Schilling, and Pedro Martínez.

Maddux&#x27;s 13–15 record in 2005 was his first losing record since 1987, and snapped a string of seventeen consecutive seasons with 15 or more wins. (Cy Young had surpassed the 15-win total for 15 straight years; both Young and Maddux reached 13+ wins for 19 consecutive seasons. This is even more impressive considering that Cy Young pitched in an era with no more than 4 regular starters that would average more than 40+ games per season, whereas Maddux pitched in an era with a 5-man rotation when reaching 40 starts in a season was virtually unheard of.)

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2006)===
Maddux&#x27;s second stint with the Chicago Cubs lasted until mid-2006, when he was traded for the first time in his career, to the Los Angeles Dodgers. At the time, the Dodgers were in the thick of a playoff race. In his first Dodger start, Maddux threw six no-hit innings before a rain delay interrupted his debut. In his next start, Maddux needed just 68 pitches to throw eight shutout innings. On August 30, 2006, he won his 330th career game, passing Steve Carlton to take sole possession of 10th on the all-time list. On September 30, 2006, Maddux pitched seven innings in San Francisco, allowing two runs and three hits in a 4–2 victory over the Giants, clinching a postseason spot for the Dodgers and notching another 15-win season. It was Maddux&#x27;s 18th season among his league&#x27;s Top 10 for wins, breaking a record he&#x27;d shared with Cy Young and Warren Spahn, who did it 17 times apiece. However, the Dodgers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Mets. Maddux started the third and final game, throwing an ineffective no-decision. Maddux was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding pitcher in MLB for 2006.

===San Diego Padres (2007–2008)===

On December 5, 2006, Maddux agreed to a one-year, $10 million deal with the San Diego Padres with a player option for the 2008 season, an option that Maddux later exercised at a reported $10 million. Maddux earned his 338th victory in the game that Trevor Hoffman earned his milestone 500th save. On August 24, 2007, he won his 343rd game to take sole possession of ninth place on the all-time win list. He achieved another milestone with the same win, becoming the only pitcher in the major leagues to have 20 consecutive seasons with at least 10 wins and placing him second on the list for most 10-win seasons, tied with Nolan Ryan and behind Don Sutton, who has 21. Also in 2007, Maddux reached 13 wins for the 20th consecutive season, passing Cy Young for that major league record. He finished the season with a career total 347 wins. Maddux won a record 17th Gold Glove award in 2007, surpassing the record held by Brooks Robinson. On May 10, 2008, Maddux won his 350th game. Also in 2008, he became the oldest pitcher to steal a base at 42, incidentally against the Braves.

===Second stint with the Los Angeles Dodgers (2008)===
Maddux was traded back to the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 19 for two players to be named later or cash considerations by the San Diego Padres. His return to Los Angeles was unlike his debut, though, as he allowed 7 earned runs on 9 hits while taking a loss against the Philadelphia Phillies.

Maddux pitched his 5,000th career inning against the San Francisco Giants on September 19. On September 27, in his final start of the season, he won his 355th game, moving him ahead of Roger Clemens into 8th place in all-time wins. Maddux ranks tenth in career strikeouts with 3,371. His strikeout total is balanced against 999 walks. For the 2008 season, he posted an 8–13 record. His 1.4 walks per 9 innings pitched were the best in the majors.

After the Dodgers won the National League West, Maddux was moved to the bullpen after manager Joe Torre decided to go with a three-man rotation. Maddux pitched three innings of relief during the series (which the Dodgers lost), allowing two runs. Maddux received his 18th Gold Glove Award in November 2008, extending his own major league record. In December, he announced his retirement.

==Post-playing career==
On January 11, 2010, Maddux was hired by the Chicago Cubs as an assistant to General Manager Jim Hendry. In his return to Chicago, his focus was on developing pitchers&#x27; styles and techniques throughout the organization, including minor league affiliates. For the 2012 season Maddux left his position with the Cubs and joined the Texas Rangers organization, where his brother Mike was the pitching coach.

He was announced as the pitching coach for the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

On February 2, 2016, he was hired by the Dodgers as a special assistant to the President of Baseball Operations, Andrew Friedman.

On July 6, 2016, Maddux was hired as an assistant baseball coach for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. For 4 years, he served as the pitching coach. Greg&#x27;s son, Chase, was a pitcher for the Rebels.

On February 14, 2023, Maddux was hired as a special assistant for Spring Training by the Texas Rangers, joining his brother Mike Maddux, who became the team&#x27;s new pitching coach.

==Pitching style==
Maddux relied on his command, composure, and guile to outwit hitters. Though his fastball touched 93 mph in his early years, his velocity steadily declined throughout his career, and was never his principal focus as a pitcher. By the end of his career, his fastball averaged less than 86 mph. Maddux was also noted for the late movement on his sinker (two-seam fastball), which, combined with his control, made him known as an excellent groundball pitcher. While Maddux was not known for his strikeout totals, his strikeout totals have often been undersold because strikeout rate has often been measured per nine innings, rather than per batter faced. Maddux alternated his two-seam fastball with an excellent circle changeup. Though these served as his primary pitches, he also threw a four-seam fastball, a cutter, a curveball, a slider, and a splitter.

Maddux was renowned for focusing on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, and then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply on the strength of his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, &quot;That was just my normal fastball that did that. ... I always had it. The pitch really started to work for me when I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective.&quot;

In addition, his propensity for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept his pitch counts low. On July 2, 1997, he won a game against the New York Yankees, for example, with the numbers &quot;nine innings, three hits, no walks, eight strikeouts, one pickoff, one double play, 84 pitches ... [in] two hours and nine minutes&quot;. Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux&#x27;s pitching consistency, saying &quot;It&#x27;s almost like a guy lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches.&quot; Speaking about Maddux&#x27;s accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, &quot;This guy can throw a ball in a teacup.&quot; Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: &quot;It seems like he&#x27;s inside your mind with you. When he knows you&#x27;re not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It&#x27;s like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove.&quot;

Maddux was also known for intensely studying hitters in preparation for his starts. He would often watch hitters take their warmup swings or read their body language to gauge their mentality. Teammate Tom Glavine said, &quot;I think the hitters think he can go back and recall every pitch he has ever thrown. That&#x27;s not the case, but I think he&#x27;s probably better at remembering things than most people are. He&#x27;s definitely better in the course of the game at making adjustments on a hitter based on what he&#x27;s seen, whether it&#x27;s one swing or a guy&#x27;s last at-bat.&quot;

Finally, Maddux has been praised for his superior pitching mechanics, helping him avoid serious arm injuries throughout his lengthy career. His only stint on the 15-day disabled list was in 2002, due to nerve inflammation on his back. One analyst of pitching mechanics wrote, &quot;Maddux&#x27;s sterling reputation for pitching mechanics is more than justified. He could repeat his delivery as well as any pitcher that I have ever seen, with consistent timing and positioning that persisted regardless of pitch type or pitch count, giving the impression that he was never fatigued.&quot; Maddux was also a highly durable pitcher, leading the National League in innings pitched in five consecutive years. He pitched at least 194 innings for 21 consecutive seasons, and finished with the lowest BB/9 ratio in the National League nine times.

==Pitching profile==
Maddux has been credited by many of his teammates with a superior ability to out-think his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez tells the story of Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros&#x27; Jeff Bagwell, in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, &quot;Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach.&quot; The batter, Los Angeles&#x27; José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers&#x27; first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who&#x27;d been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, &quot;Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track.&quot; The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.
Early in the 2000 season, Maddux was asked by sportswriter Bob Nightengale what had been the most memorable at-bat of his pitching career. Maddux said it was striking out Dave Martinez to end a regular season game. Nightengale was surprised Maddux hadn&#x27;t picked a postseason game, or a more famous player. Maddux explained: &quot;I remember that one because he got a hit off me in the same situation (full count, bases loaded, two out in the 9th inning) seven years earlier. I told myself if I ever got in the same situation again, I&#x27;ll pitch him differently. It took me seven years, but I got him.&quot;

Publicly, however, Maddux is dismissive of his reputation, saying, &quot;People think I&#x27;m smart? You know what makes you smart? Locate your fastball down and away. That&#x27;s what makes you smart. You talk to Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, or Tom Seaver. They&#x27;ll all tell you the same thing. It&#x27;s not your arm that makes you a great pitcher. It&#x27;s that thing between both of your ears we call a brain.&quot;

To this day, Maddux maintains Koufax, Gibson, and Seaver are the three best pitchers of the &quot;live ball&quot; era of baseball. Informed by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; he had been voted best pitcher of the 1990s, he replied, &quot;It [the award] could have gone to Glavine or Smoltz just as easily and each would have deserved it. They&#x27;re both great pitchers.&quot;

Maddux never walked more than 82 batters in any season of his career, averaging fewer than 2 walks per game. In 1997, Maddux allowed 20 walks in 232+ innings, or 0.77 per nine innings. In 2001, he set a National League record by going 72 innings without giving up a walk.

Maddux&#x27;s low walk totals also kept his pitch counts down, enabling him to go deeper into games. In 31 starts, Maddux threw nine innings with 100 or fewer pitches. Ten of those starts were under 90 pitches, including a 78-pitch complete game in July 1997, the most efficient start by any pitcher since 1979. In recognition of this, the statistic describing a complete game shut-out thrown in less than 100 pitches was named after him. Maddux is the career leader for this stat, having pitched thirteen such games.

He is also known to finish the game quickly. On June 27, 1998, he pitched a complete-game shutout against the Toronto Blue Jays in 102 pitches, but it was his fastest game in terms of time: 106 minutes, or 1 hour 46 minutes. This is including the customary 6th-inning timeout and mound visit.

==Awards==
In addition to his pitching skills, Maddux was an excellent fielding pitcher. He won 18 Gold Gloves, the record for any position. Of his 18 total awards, Maddux won 10 with the Braves, five with the Cubs, two with the Dodgers and one with the Padres. Maddux was also a good hitting pitcher, with a career .171 batting average, including four seasons batting .200 or better. He hit 5 home runs, with 84 RBIs.

Maddux pitched in 13 Division Series contests, 17 League Championship games and five World Series games. He has a 3.27 ERA in 198 postseason innings, including an outstanding 2.09 ERA in World Series innings. He was chosen for the National League All-Star team eight times.

Maddux won 20 games only twice, in 1992 and 1993. However, he won 19 games five times (including the 1995 season which was reduced to 144 games from the strike of 1994), 18 games twice, and 16 in the strike shortened 1994 season (which was reduced to 115 games). He won four ERA titles (in 1993–1995 and 1998), and led the NL in shutouts five times. He holds the major league record for seasons leading his league in games started (7). He also holds the record for most seasons finishing in the top 10 in the league in wins (18).

In his 2009 book, &quot;The Annual Baseball Gold Mine&quot; baseball statistics guru Bill James found Maddux to be far and away the most underrated player in baseball history. The methodology for this included the fact that though Maddux only won 20 games twice, he won 19 games five times. He also had only one season of 200 or more strikeouts but had seasons of 199, 198 and 197, respectively, which diminished his reputation as a strikeout pitcher. In addition to that James also argued that although he had 18 seasons of 200 or more innings pitched, he also had three seasons of , 198 and 194 innings pitched.

In 1999, Maddux ranked 39th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking pitcher then active. He was also nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. However, when &quot;TSN&quot; updated their list in 2005, Maddux had fallen to number 51.

The Cubs retired jersey number 31 on May 3, 2009, in honor of Maddux and Ferguson Jenkins. The Atlanta Braves retired Maddux&#x27;s number 31, on July 17, 2009.

&quot;I get asked all the time was he the best pitcher I ever saw. Was he the smartest pitcher I ever saw? The most competitive I ever saw? The best teammate I ever saw? The answer is yes to all of those&quot;, said Braves manager Bobby Cox at the banquet to induct Maddux into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame at the Omni Hotel in Atlanta on July 17, 2009.

On January 8, 2014, Maddux was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. The pitcher later announced that he would not have a team logo on his plaque, citing his history with the Atlanta Braves and Chicago Cubs: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible for me to choose one of those teams ... as the fans of both clubs in each of those cities were so wonderful&quot;, Maddux said.

==Personal life==
Maddux was born on April 14, 1966, the same day as former Braves teammate David Justice, and shares a birthday with former teammate Steve Avery. He is married to Kathy; the couple has two children; a daughter, Paige Maddux (born December 9, 1993), and a son, Chase Maddux (born April 19, 1997). They reside in Las Vegas.

In 2002, in the episode &quot;Take Me out of the Ballgame&quot;, of the TV series &quot;Do Over&quot;, the main character lost a baseball game to a young Greg Maddux, who was played by Shad Hart.

The song &quot;Movement and Location&quot; from the Punch Brothers album &quot;Who&#x27;s Feeling Young Now?&quot; was written about Maddux.

<text>Lynne Mary Jones (born 26 April 1951) is a British politician, who was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Selly Oak from 1992 until 2010.

In October 2023, Jones reportedly quit the Labour Party following comments Keir Starmer made on the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. In May 2024, Jones joined the Green Party of England and Wales.

==Early life==
Jones was born in Birmingham, and attended the local Bartley Green Girls&#x27; Grammar School (now the comprehensive Hillcrest School) in Woodgate. She studied Biochemistry at the University of Birmingham, eventually gaining her Ph.D. in 1979. She also has a post-graduate Diploma in Housing Studies from Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University). She worked in research at the University of Birmingham from 1972–86. She was a housing association manager from 1987–92. She joined the Labour Party in 1974.

She has worked in both science and housing, and was a councillor on Birmingham City Council representing Kings Norton ward from 1980–94.

===Research interests===
She first studied stimulus-response coupling in the rat parotid gland and at alpha adrenergic receptors. This led to a discovery that there are cell-surface receptors that are stimulated by hormones and neurotransmitters controlled by changes of intracellular calcium ion levels. It also involves the conversion of inositol phospholipids in the cell membrane. She also worked on the process of agonist-stimulated incorporation of radioactive phosphate into inositol phospholipids.

==Parliamentary career==
Jones was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general election. She was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group and took part in almost all of the backbench rebellions against the Labour government, describing herself in 2006 as &quot;one of the usual suspects&quot; among the backbenchers.

Jones was Chair of the Parliamentary Forum on Transsexualism, and is a patron of Press for Change. From 1993–2001 she was on the Science and Technology Select Committee. During the 2005–10 parliament she was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee.

===Leadership challenge===
In February 2006, she announced her intention to stand against then Chancellor Gordon Brown in the Labour Party leadership contest expected to follow Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s resignation if nobody else did, so that Brown could not simply be &quot;crowned&quot;. Subsequently, Socialist Campaign Group Chair John McDonnell attempted to stand instead, but failed to gain enough nominations from MPs and Brown was unopposed.

===Retirement===
Following boundary changes in Birmingham, which reduced its parliamentary representation from eleven to ten seats, Jones was expected to apply for selection for the redrawn Selly Oak constituency which contained wards from the former Selly Oak and Hall Green constituencies. However, in January 2007 Jones announced her intention to stand down at the 2010 general election. Jones refused to endorse Roger Godsiff in Hall Green, instead supporting the Respect candidate Salma Yaqoob, who came second.

===National Executive Committee===
Jones ran to be on Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee, challenging former Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones.

==Personal life==
She is married, and has two sons (including one born in January 1990). She married Chris Kirk in April 1994 in Lambeth. He is Chief Executive of the Biochemical Society. She is a keen cyclist.

In November 2009, she announced she was having treatment for breast cancer after a tumour was discovered at an early stage.

<text>Plesiosauroidea (; Greek: &#x27;near, close to&#x27; and &#x27;lizard&#x27;) is an extinct clade of carnivorous marine reptiles. They have the snake-like longest neck to body ratio of any reptile. Plesiosauroids are known from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. After their discovery, some plesiosauroids were said to have resembled &quot;a snake threaded through the shell of a turtle&quot;, although they had no shell.

Plesiosauroidea appeared at the Early Jurassic Period (late Sinemurian stage) and thrived until the K-Pg extinction, at the end of the Cretaceous Period. The oldest confirmed plesiosauroid is &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; itself, as all younger taxa were recently found to be pliosauroids. While they were Mesozoic diapsid reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs, they did not belong to the latter. Gastroliths are frequently found associated with plesiosaurs.

==History of discovery==

The first complete plesiosauroid skeletons were found in England by Mary Anning, in the early 19th century, and were amongst the first fossil vertebrates to be described by science. Plesiosauroid remains were found by the Scottish geologist Hugh Miller in 1844 in the rocks of the Great Estuarine Group (then known as &#x27;Series&#x27;) of western Scotland. Many others have been found, some of them virtually complete, and new discoveries are made frequently. One of the finest specimens was found in 2002 on the coast of Somerset (England) by someone fishing from the shore. This specimen, called the Collard specimen after its finder, was on display in Taunton Museum in 2007. Another, less complete, skeleton was also found in 2002, in the cliffs at Filey, Yorkshire, England, by an amateur palaeontologist. The preserved skeleton is displayed at Rotunda Museum in Scarborough.

==Description==

Plesiosauroids had a broad body and a short tail. They retained their ancestral two pairs of limbs, which evolved into large flippers.

It has been determined by teeth records that several sea-dwelling reptiles, including plesiosauroids, had a warm-blooded metabolism similar to that of mammals. They could generate endothermic heat to survive in colder habitats.

==Evolution==
Plesiosauroids evolved from earlier, similar forms such as pistosaurs. There are a number of families of plesiosauroids, which retain the same general appearance and are distinguished by various specific details. These include the Plesiosauridae, unspecialized types which are limited to the Early Jurassic period; Cryptoclididae, (e.g. &quot;Cryptoclidus&quot;), with a medium-long neck and somewhat stocky build; Elasmosauridae, with very long, flexible necks and tiny heads; and the Cimoliasauridae, a poorly known group of small Cretaceous forms. According to traditional classifications, all plesiosauroids have a small head and long neck but, in recent classifications, one short-necked and large-headed Cretaceous group, the Polycotylidae, are included under the Plesiosauroidea, rather than under the traditional Pliosauroidea. Size of different plesiosaurs varied significantly, with an estimated length of &quot;Trinacromerum&quot; being three meters and &quot;Mauisaurus&quot; growing to twenty meters.

===Relationships===
Within Plesiosauroidea, there is a more exclusive group, Cryptoclidia. Cryptoclidia was named and defined as a node clade in 2010 by Hilary Ketchum and Roger Benson: the group consisting of the last common ancestor of &quot;Cryptoclidus eurymerus&quot; and &quot;Polycotylus latipinnis&quot;; and all its descendants.

The smaller group within Cryptoclidia was erected prior, in 2007 under the name &quot;Leptocleidoidea&quot;. Although established as a clade, the name Leptocleidoidea implies that it is a superfamily. Leptocleidoidea is placed within the superfamily Plesiosauroidea, so it was renamed Leptocleidia by Hilary F. Ketchum and Roger B. J. Benson (2010) to avoid confusion with ranks. Leptocleidia is a node-based taxon which was defined by Ketchum and Benson as &quot;&quot;Leptocleidus superstes&quot;, &quot;Polycotylus latipinnis&quot;, their most recent common ancestor and all of its descendants&quot;.
The following cladogram follows an analysis by Benson &amp; Druckenmiller (2014).
==Behavior==

Unlike their pliosauroid cousins, plesiosauroids (with the exception of the Polycotylidae) were probably slow swimmers. It is likely that they cruised slowly below the surface of the water, using their long flexible neck to move their head into position to snap up unwary fish or cephalopods. Their four-flippered swimming adaptation may have given them exceptional maneuverability, so that they could swiftly rotate their bodies as an aid to catching prey.

Contrary to many reconstructions of plesiosauroids, it would have been impossible for them to lift their head and long neck above the surface, in the &quot;swan-like&quot; pose that is often shown. Even if they had been able to bend their necks upward to that degree (which they could not), gravity would have tipped their body forward and kept most of the heavy neck in the water.

On 12 August 2011, researchers from the U.S. described a fossil of a pregnant plesiosaur found on a Kansas ranch in 1987. The plesiosauroid, &quot;Polycotylus latippinus&quot;, has confirmed that these predatory marine reptiles gave birth to single, large, live offspring—contrary to other marine reptile reproduction which typically involves a large number of small babies. Before this study, plesiosauroids had sometimes been portrayed crawling out of water to lay eggs in the manner of sea turtles, but experts had long suspected that their anatomy was not compatible with movement on land. The adult plesiosaur measures long and the juvenile is long.

<doc id="182521" wikidata="Q2734894" url="?curid=182521" title="Bull Ring, Birmingham">
<text>The Bull Ring is a major shopping area in central Birmingham, England, consisting of open-air and indoor market stalls as well as a large indoor shopping centre. The Bull Ring has been an important feature of Birmingham since the Middle Ages, when its market was first held, developing into its main market when the town grew into an industrial city. The current shopping centre complex, styled as &quot;Bullring&quot;, forms the United Kingdom&#x27;s largest city centre based shopping centre when coupled with Grand Central, to which it is connected via a pedestrian overpass, collectively branded as Bullring &amp; Grand Central. The current Bullring opened in 2003, replacing a previous 1960s complex, and houses one of only four Selfridges department stores in the country.

The site is located on the edge of the sandstone city ridge which results in the steep gradient towards Digbeth. The slope drops approximately from New Street to St Martin&#x27;s Church and is visible near the church.

== Toponym ==
The area was first known as Corn Cheaping, a reference to the corn market on the site. The name Bull Ring referred to the green within Corn Cheaping that was used for bull-baiting. The &#x27;ring&#x27; was a hoop of iron in Corn Cheaping to which bulls were tied for baiting before slaughter. The joining of the two words in the 21st-century development of the area to form Bullring caused controversy amongst some residents and others who were angry at the change of what was described as a &quot;historic spelling&quot;.
== History of the markets ==
The market legally began in 1154 when Peter de Bermingham, a local landowner, obtained a Charter of Marketing Rights from King Henry II. Initially, a textile trade began developing in the area and it was first mentioned in 1232 in a document, in which one merchant is described as a business partner to William de Bermingham and being in the ownership of four weavers, a smith, a tailor and a purveyor. Seven years later, another document described another mercer in the area. Within the next ten years, the area developed into a leading market town and a major cloth trade was established.

The name Mercer Street is first mentioned in the Survey of Birmingham of 1553. This was a result of the prominence of the area in the cloth trade. In the 16th century and 17th century, Mercer Street rapidly developed and became cramped. In the early 18th century Mercer Street was known as Spicer Street, reflecting the growing grocery and meat trade that had begun to take over from the cloth trade. By the end of the century the street was known as Spiceal Street. Despite being overcrowded and cramped, many houses on the street had gardens as indicated by an advertisement for a residential property in 1798. Houses were constructed close to St Martin&#x27;s Church, eventually encircling it. These became known as the Roundabout Houses.

On a map produced by Westley in 1731, other markets had developed nearby including food, cattle and corn markets with other markets located nearby on the High Street. This corn market was moved to the Corn Exchange on Carrs Lane in 1848. The Bull Ring developed into the main retail market area for Birmingham as the town grew into a modern industrial city.

The earliest known building for public meetings in the town with any architectural record is the High Cross, which stood within the Bull Ring. The last known construction work was in 1703; it was demolished in 1784. The cross was also known as the Old Cross, to distinguish it from the Welch Cross, and was also nicknamed the Butter Cross due to farmwives selling dairy produce beneath its arches.

A series of events in Birmingham&#x27;s political history saw the area become a popular meeting place for demonstrations and speeches from leaders of working class movements during the 1830s and 1840s.

===Bull Ring Riots, 1839===
In 1839, the Bull Ring was the location of the Bull Ring Riots. The first riot occurred on 4 July 1839, after Mayor William Scholefield had read the Riot Act before a meeting of Chartists and then deployed 60 officers of the Metropolitan Police when they failed to disperse. There was widespread vandalism and destruction of property. The riots prompted fears amongst the town&#x27;s residents at the council&#x27;s inability to prevent or control the riots and led to speculation that the council was tolerant of lawlessness. Because of disorderly behaviour at fairs, in 1861 the area, along with Smithfield and Digbeth, became the only place in central Birmingham where fairs were permitted. In 1875, all fairs were banned from the town.

The area around the market site developed and, by the Victorian era, a large number of shops were operating there. Immigrants set up businesses such as flower-sellers and umbrella vendors. The Lord Nelson statue became the location for preaching and political protests. Well-known preachers of the time were nicknamed &quot;Holy Joe&quot; and &quot;Jimmy Jesus&quot;.

=== Markets in the Bull Ring ===

In the late 18th century, street commissioners were authorised to buy and demolish houses in the town centre, including houses surrounding the Bull Ring, and to centre all market activity in the area. This was a result of new markets being established across the city in scattered locations creating severe congestion. Demolition of these properties began slowly; however, after the Birmingham Improvement Act 1801, the speed of demolition increased and by 1810 all properties in the area had been cleared as according to the 1810 Map of Birmingham by Kempson. During the clearance, small streets such as The Shambles, Cock (or Well) Street and Corn Cheaping, which had existed before the Bull Ring, were removed. The Shambles was originally a row of butchers&#x27; stores, situated close to the road leading from the location where bulls were slaughtered.

A wide area fronting St Martin&#x27;s Church formed the marketplace. The Street Commissioners decided that a sheltered market hall was needed. They bought the market rights from the lord of the manor and, by 1832, all properties on site had been purchased, with exception of two, whose owners demanded a higher price. To fund the purchase of these properties, two buildings were constructed either side of the market hall and the leases sold at auction. Construction of the Market Hall, designed by Charles Edge (an architect of Birmingham Town Hall), began in February 1833. It was completed by Dewsbury and Walthews at a cost of £20,000 (£44,800 if the price of acquiring the land is included) and opened on 12 February 1835 and contained 600 market stalls.

In 1869, the fish market was completed on the site of the Nelson Hotel (formerly the Dog Inn). The Dog Inn was located at the top end of Spiceal Street and the land above was owned by the Cowper family. The fish market was built upon Cowper Street, named after the family, on Summer Lane. In 1884, a sheltered vegetable market in Jamaica Row was also completed.

The trade of horses prospered in the area with over 3,000 horses for sale at its peak during the 1880s. However this fell into rapid decline; the last horse trading fair took place in 1911 with only eleven horses and one donkey in attendance.
A large amount of the area survived World War II; however, nearby New Street was heavily bombed. Shops sold tax-free products to encourage shoppers to buy them as it was difficult for the public to buy goods even a decade after the end of the war. Woolworths set up on Spiceal Street in the Bull Ring and became a popular shop, becoming the largest store on the street. The old Market Hall was gutted on 25 August 1940 by an incendiary attack, and remained as an empty shell, used for small exhibitions and open markets. No repair work was conducted on the building and the arches that housed the windows were bricked up.

=== Archaeology on the site ===
As the redevelopment of 2000 began, archaeological excavations were conducted on the site. Finds dated back to the 12th century; a ditch was discovered where the Selfridges store and Park Street car park are now situated. Archaeologists discovered that this was a boundary separating houses from a deer park in an area now occupied by Moor Street station. Rubbish discovered in the ditch was found to include fragments of misfired pottery with criss-cross patterns, indicating that pottery kilns had been located there in the 13th century. Many leather tanning pits dating to the 17th and 18th centuries were found on the Park Street car park site. These contained fragments of crucibles, pottery vessels in which metal was melted. The residues in these were alloys of copper with zinc, lead and tin. On the site where the Indoor Markets are now located, archaeologists discovered further leather tanning pits, these dating from the 13th century.

Burials had also been discovered in the churchyard of St Martin&#x27;s dating to the 18th and 19th century. Records of families were used to identify the bodies.

Four information panels providing information on the discoveries and history of the site are in the Bull Ring at St Martin&#x27;s Square, Edgbaston Street, Park Street and High Street.

== The first Bull Ring Centre ==
In 1955, shops began to close down as the redevelopment of the area was proposed. Plans drawn up showed the creation of new roads and the demolition of old ones and all the buildings on the proposed site. Eleven companies submitted plans for the new Bull Ring however, Birmingham City Council elected to go for the proposals submitted by John Laing &amp; Sons which used substantial material from designs by James A. Roberts. Demolition began in the late-1950s beginning with the demolition of the old fish market. Construction commenced in the summer of 1961.

The outdoor market area was opened in June 1962 with 150 stalls within the new Bull Ring, which was still under construction.

In 1964, construction of the Birmingham Bull Ring Centre neared completion. It was a mixture of traditional open-air market stalls and a new indoor shopping centre, the first indoor city-centre shopping centre in the UK. It was opened by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh alongside Alderman Frank Price and Sir Herbert Manzoni on 29 May 1964 and had cost an estimated £8 million. The shopping centre covered and had of retail trade area. Shortly after opening, the complex was visited by Queen Elizabeth II.

On the lower level of the shopping centre was the Bull Ring Bus Station which was used mostly by Midland Red and its successors. Midland Red West operated a travel centre there until closure of the bus station.

The market area was submerged and had approximately 150 stalls with the majority selling food. It was split by a large road which connected to the inner ring road which was built from 1967 till 1971. There was direct access to New Street station and the market area could be easily accessed from Moor Street station. A multi-storey car park was also located within the complex with 500 spaces for cars. Access to roads by foot could be achieved through a network of subways. As part of the development, a nine-storey office block designed by James A. Roberts was built. This was attached to the multi-storey car park. The floors were of reinforced concrete, 12 inches in thickness. A bold illuminated sign by D.R.U. was located on the end wall, facing the city centre.

Jamaica Row and Spiceal Street had been demolished and removed during the development, being replaced by a submerged market area.

There were 140 shop units located on of room on a site. There were also 19 escalators, 40 lifts, 96 public doors, six miles (10 km) of air ducting and of pipe work. The shopping centre was air conditioned and had music played to create an intimate atmosphere within the building.

The remains of old Market Hall were demolished in 1963 and replaced by Manzoni Gardens; an open space designed for shoppers to relax. In the 1970s a statue of King Kong stood there.

A mural of a bull was located on the side of the building as visitors entered via the road splitting the market area.

The 1960s&#x27; Bull Ring Centre had problems from the beginning and was very much a product of its era. At the time of its opening it was considered the height of modernity, but higher rentals within the shopping centre meant that traders turned away from it. The public were also less inclined to use the subways and escalators, which stopped working regularly. Also, it did not age well and soon became generally regarded as an unfortunate example of 1960s Brutalist architecture, with its boxy grey concrete design and its isolation within ringroads connected only by pedestrian subways. It was, by the 1980s, much disliked by the public and contributed to the popular conception that Birmingham was a concrete jungle of shopping centres and motorways.

In 2015, Historic England included the four bull ring murals, designed by Trewin Copplestone, which decorated the outside walls of the shopping centre, in a list of public works that have been lost, sold, stolen or destroyed.

===Rotunda===
A part of the James A. Roberts design for the first Bull Ring Shopping Centre included a 12-storey circular office block. However, upon revising his design this was increased to 25 storeys. As a result of this, plans for a revolving rooftop restaurant and a cinema were dropped. This became the Rotunda and is a surviving component of the 1960s development. Due to problems during construction, the building never reached the intended height. Although never used, the revolving section remains in place due to the late decision to drop the restaurant from the plans.

The Rotunda has been converted into apartments by developers Urban Splash. Although located close to the development and constructed at the same time as the 1960s centre, it was not part of the development despite being included in the design. A poem is engraved into one of the stones in the wall of the Bullring dedicated to the Rotunda. The public space to the front of both malls facing the High Street and New Street is named Rotunda Square after the building.
== Redevelopment of the Bull Ring ==
===Early proposals===

Plans for redevelopments began in the 1980s, with many being just visions. In 1987, the first serious plans were released under a document called &quot;The People&#x27;s Plan&quot; which had been designed by Chapman Taylor Architects for London and Edinburgh Trust (LET), who had bought the land following the end of Laing&#x27;s lease. It proposed the full demolition of the Bull Ring Shopping Centre and the construction of a new mall described as &quot;a huge aircraft-carrier settled on the streetscape of the city&quot;. The mall was a long box with three floors.

A pressure group called Birmingham for People was formed who wanted to aid the redevelopment of the Bull Ring. They distributed leaflets of the proposals to 44,000 homes in the city. However, as a result of local opinion, LET were forced to change their proposals.

In 1988, in response to the calls for a new design, LET released a masterplan of numerous buildings with a wide pedestrianised street leading to St Martin&#x27;s Church. As part of the design, two high rise buildings of a similar height to the Rotunda were proposed to front New Street station and Moor Street station. However, lack of local support failed to allow the plans to materialise.

In 1995, LET again amended their designs through work with the public. However, a retail recession meant that the plans could not begin construction and they never developed.

===Successful proposal===

After the failure of the LET plan, new plans began to surface. In the mid-1990s, another serious proposal was produced and this gained support resulting in the publication of a masterplan. However, soon after the publication of the masterplan, changes were made to the design. In 1998, Selfridges voiced reservations about opening a store in Birmingham due to restrictions on doing so and considered opening a store in Glasgow instead. It was an important part of the planned Redevelopment of Birmingham.

====Construction and opening====

The successful proposal received planning permission and demolition of the 1960s Bull Ring Shopping Centre commenced in 2000 with the traders moving to the Rag Market in Edgbaston Street. It was replaced by a new design, mixing both traditional market activity with modern retail units. The main contractor was Sir Robert McAlpine. The structural engineer was Waterman Group. The first building to be completed was the Nationwide Building Society which, while not directly connected to the shopping centre, was part of the development. A new indoor shopping centre, &quot;Bullring&quot; (as the commercial entity is branded) opened on 4 September 2003.

Because a major road and two railway tunnels ran under the northern edge of the site, two levels of retail areas are dramatically suspended from four 45m arched steel trusses, each weighing 120 tonnes, which are supported on piles either side of the railway tunnels.

The first week of trading saw the new shopping centre under considerable pressure due to the large crowds it attracted. On 4 September 2003, the day of opening, some 276,600 people visited the shopping centre. In year 2004 it was the busiest shopping centre in the United Kingdom with 36.5 million visitors.
===Design and layout===

Bullring Shopping Centre was masterplanned and designed mainly by Benoy. The shopping centre consists of two main buildings (East and West Mall) which are connected by an underground passage lined with shops and is also accessible from St Martin&#x27;s Square via glass doors. They are sheltered by a glass roof known as the SkyPlane which covers and appears to have no visible means of support. The two malls are different internally in design. The balustrades in the East Mall consist of integrated glass &#x27;jewels&#x27; within the metal framework, and are of different colours formed through polyester powder coating. It features a dramatic landmark building, housing a branch of Selfridges department store to a design by the Future Systems architectural practice. The store is clad in 15,000 shiny aluminium discs and was inspired by a Paco Rabanne sequinned dress. The Selfridges store cost £60 million and the contractor was Laing O&#x27;Rourke. Covering an area of , the designs for the Selfridges store were first unveiled in 1999, not long before demolition of the original shopping centre began. The Selfridges store has won eight awards including the RIBA Award for Architecture 2004 and Destination of the Year Retail Week Awards 2004.

There is a multi-storey car park opposite Selfridges on Park Street which is connected to the Selfridges store via a 37-metre long, curved, polycarbonate-covered footbridge, known as the Parametric Bridge, suspended over the street. On the ground floor of the car park there is retail space which was previously a furniture showroom.

In 2005, a small Costa Coffee café, designed by Marks Barfield Architects and dubbed the Spiral Café, was constructed alongside the steps leading towards to New Street from St Martin&#x27;s Square. The building&#x27;s shape resembled that of shell and featured a curved bronze roof with both ends covered with glass. The main contractors were Thomas Vale and the structural engineers were Price &amp; Myers. The building form is inspired by the mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci who identified natural patterns of growth found throughout the universe, from the shapes of shells and pines cones to fractal patterns within galaxies. The café was knocked down as part of the Spiceal Street redevelopment in 2011.

The entire redevelopment was accompanied by an official project magazine and then commemorated with an &#x27;art book&#x27; style book which covered Bullring&#x27;s transformation in illustration and photography. Both book and magazine were produced by specialist publisher Alma Media International on behalf of the developers.

The shopping centre&#x27;s design has both its admirers and detractors. In 2008, a poll conducted in conjunction with &quot;SimCity Creator&quot; stated that Bullring was the ugliest building in the country, although the poll has been criticised.

====Spiceal Street====
On 6 September 2010, plans were announced for a expansion with the creation of three new restaurant units totalling around in St Martins Square with the existing Pizza Hut and Nandos to be extended out closer to St Martins Church and thus expanded. The new restaurants are &#x27;Browns Bar &amp; Brasserie&#x27; and &#x27;Chaobaby&#x27;, opening their first restaurants in Birmingham in the larger two of the units closest to Jamies Italian. The third unit, closest to Selfridges is home to &#x27;Handmade Burger Co&#x27;. In addition to the existing Nandos, Wagamama, Pizza Hut, Jamie&#x27;s Italian and &#x27;Mount Fuiji&#x27;. this has created a hub of seven restaurants named after the traditional Spiceal Street. Construction of the part indoor, part outdoor development commenced in March 2011 and consists of a glass, wooden and aluminium exterior and &quot;ribbon&quot; effect roof. The award-winning Spiral Cafe that was once sited here has been relocated off-site. The new Spiceal Street opened on 24 November 2011. Since then, Jamie&#x27;s Italian closed after the company went into administration in May 2019, and Handmade Burger Co would suffer the same fate 8 months later in January 2020, later to be replaced by Vietnamese Street Kitchen.

=== Artwork ===

Numerous pieces of artwork are in the grounds of the centre:

*A glass mural by artist Martin Donlin faces the entrance to Birmingham New Street station.
*Three &quot;light wand&quot;s of varying height stand in Rotunda square near the entrances to both wings of Bullring. The wands sway in the wind and reflective platforms which protrude from the main carbon fibre core reflect light to create a beacon effect. At night the cores are illuminated in the colours of the shafts which are blue, green and red.
*At the main entrance to the west building stands &quot;The Guardian&quot;, a bronze sculpture of a running, turning bull. It was created by Laurence Broderick and has become a very popular photographic feature for visitors to Birmingham. The statue was vandalised in 2005, requiring that it be removed for repairs, but was returned to its spot again later that year. The sculptor gave support to calls for the statue to be renamed &quot;Brummie the Bull&quot;. However, it is more widely known as simply &quot;The Bull&quot;. The sculpture was vandalised again in 2006. 
*Looking over St Martin&#x27;s Square is the statue of Horatio Nelson. The bronze statue was the first public monument for Birmingham and was sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It is also the first figurative memorial to Lord Nelson to be erected in Great Britain (only second in the world after Montreal) and was unveiled on 25 October 1809, as part of King George III&#x27;s Golden Jubilee celebrations. It was originally located on the edge of the previous Bull Ring and stood on a marble base, but this was damaged when the statue was moved in 1958 and the current Portland stone plinth dates from 1960. As part of the Bullring development, the developer agreed to restore the statue and railings, but in 2003 when the Bullring opened, there was no sign of the railings. The Birmingham Civic Society mounted a campaign to get the railings re-instated, whilst Bullring argued they were a health and safety risk and would destroy the openness of the public space. However, the railing were re-instated in September 2005 for the bi-centenary celebrations of the Battle of Trafalgar.
*As each Christmas approaches, a silver-coloured structure is erected in St Martin&#x27;s Square which resembles a stylised Christmas tree. Large chrome balls hang within the conical-shaped structure which is adorned in chrome stars. Large 3-dimensional stars hang between both buildings. Both the stars and chrome sculpture are illuminated at night.
*On 4 June 2008, the &#x27;Bullring Britannia&#x27;, a cruise ship located outside the shopping centre in St Martin&#x27;s Square, was unveiled by the shopping centre owners. Throughout the summer, events took place aboard the ship including fashion shows, Mr Sexy Legs competition and activities for children.

<text>Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (6 July 1818 – 13 March 1879) was a German chess master. He won the great international tournaments of 1851 and 1862, but lost matches to Paul Morphy in 1858, and to Wilhelm Steinitz in 1866. Accordingly, he is generally regarded as having been the world&#x27;s leading chess player from 1851 to 1858, and leading active player from 1862 to 1866, although the title of World Chess Champion did not yet exist.

Anderssen became the most successful tournament player in Europe, winning over half the events he entered, including the very strong Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. He achieved most of these successes when he was over the age of 50.

Anderssen is famous today for his brilliant sacrificial attacking play, particularly in the &quot;Immortal Game&quot; (1851) and the &quot;Evergreen Game&quot; (1852). He was an important figure in the development of chess problems, driving forward the transition from the &quot;Old School&quot; of problem composition to the elegance and complexity of modern compositions. He was also one of the most likeable of chess masters and became an &quot;elder statesman&quot; of the game, to whom others turned for advice or arbitration.

==Background and early life==
Anderssen was born in Breslau (now called Wrocław, Poland), in the Prussian Province of Silesia, in 1818. He lived there for most of his life, sharing a house with and supporting his widowed mother and his unmarried sister. Anderssen never married. He graduated from the public gymnasium (high school) in Breslau and then attended university, where he studied mathematics and philosophy. After graduating in 1847 at the age of 29, he took a position at the Friedrichs-Gymnasium as an instructor and later as Professor of Mathematics. Anderssen lived a quiet, stable, responsible, respectable middle-class life. His career was teaching mathematics, while his hobby and passion was playing chess.

When Anderssen was nine years old, his father taught him how to play chess. Anderssen said that as a boy, he learned the strategy of the game from a copy of William Lewis&#x27; book &quot;Fifty Games between Labourdonnais and McDonnell&quot; (1835).

==Chess career==

===First steps===
Anderssen first came to the attention of the chess world when he published &quot;Aufgabe für Schachspieler&quot; (&quot;Task for chess players&quot;), a collection of 60 chess problems, in 1842. He continued to publish problems for many years, both in magazines and as a second collection in 1852. These brought him to the attention of the &quot;Berlin Pleiades&quot; group, which included some of the strongest players of the time, and he played matches against some of them. Anderssen&#x27;s development as a player was relatively slow, largely because he could spare neither the time nor the money to play many matches against strong players. Nevertheless, by 1846 he was able to put up a good fight against another Pleiades member, Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa, who may have been the world&#x27;s strongest player at the time. In 1846, he became the editor of the magazine &quot;Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft&quot; (later called &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot;) when its founder Ludwig Bledow, one of the &quot;Berlin Pleiades&quot;, died. Anderssen held this post until 1865.

===London 1851===

In 1848, Anderssen drew a match with the professional player Daniel Harrwitz. On the basis of this match and his general chess reputation, he was invited to represent German chess at the first international chess tournament, to be held in London in 1851. Anderssen was reluctant to accept the invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However the tournament&#x27;s principal organizer, Howard Staunton, offered to pay Anderssen&#x27;s travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize. Anderssen accepted this generous offer.

Anderssen&#x27;s preparations for the 1851 London International Tournament produced a surge in his playing strength: he played over 100 games in early 1851 against strong opponents including Carl Mayet, Ernst Falkbeer, Max Lange and Jean Dufresne. The 1851 International Tournament was a knock-out event in which pairs of competitors played short matches, and Anderssen won it by beating Lionel Kieseritzky, József Szén, Staunton, and Marmaduke Wyvill – by margins of at least two games in every case. His prize was two-thirds of the total prize fund of £500, i.e. about £335; that is equivalent to about £240,000 ($370,200) in 2006&#x27;s money. When Anderssen and Szén found they were to play each other, they agreed that, if either won the tournament, the other would receive one-third of the prize; this does not appear to have been considered in any way unethical.

Although most chess books regard Wilhelm Steinitz as the first true world champion, one of the organizers of the 1851 London International Tournament had said the contest was for &quot;the baton of the World&#x27;s Chess Champion&quot;. In fact Anderssen was not described as &quot;the world champion&quot;, but the tournament established Anderssen as the world&#x27;s leading chess player. The London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organized a tournament that was played a month later and included several players who had competed in the International Tournament. The result was the same – Anderssen won.

===Morphy match, 1858===

Opportunities for tournament play remained rare, and Anderssen was reluctant to travel far because of the expense. In his one recorded tournament between 1851 and 1862, a one-game-per-round knock-out tournament at Manchester in 1857, he was eliminated in the second round. Then in late 1858, he was beaten 8–3 by the American champion Paul Morphy in a famous match held in Paris, France (two wins, two draws, seven losses). Although Anderssen knew as well as anyone how to attack, Morphy understood much better when to attack and how to prepare an attack. Morphy had recently scored equally convincing wins in matches against other top-class players: Johann Löwenthal, the Rev. John Owen and Daniel Harrwitz. Morphy returned to the United States in 1859 and soon afterwards announced his retirement from serious chess, however, making Anderssen once again the strongest &quot;active&quot; player.

Anderssen played the curious opening move 1.a3 in three games of his match against Morphy, and broke even with it (one loss, one draw, one win). This opening move, now referred to as &quot;Anderssen&#x27;s Opening&quot;, has never been popular in serious competition.

===Other games 1851–1862===
Shortly after the 1851 London International Tournament, Anderssen played his two most famous games, both casual encounters which he won by combinations that involved several sacrifices. In the first, as White against Lionel Kieseritzky in London on 21 June 1851, just after the International Tournament (1851) and now called the &quot;Immortal Game&quot;, he sacrificed a bishop, both rooks and finally his queen. In the second, played in Berlin in 1852 as White against Jean Dufresne and now called the &quot;Evergreen Game&quot;, the total sacrifice was more modest, but still exceeded a queen and a minor piece.

After the match with Morphy, Anderssen played two matches against Ignác Kolisch, one of the leading players of the time, who later became a wealthy banker and patron of chess. Anderssen drew their match in 1860 and narrowly won in 1861 (5/9; won four, drew two, lost three; Kolisch was ahead at the half-way stage).

===London 1862===
Anderssen won the London 1862 chess tournament, the first international round-robin tournament (in which each participant plays a game against each of the others) with a score of twelve wins out of thirteen games. He lost only one game, to the Rev. John Owen and finished two points ahead of Louis Paulsen, who had the best playing record in the early 1860s. Morphy had retired from chess at this time, so Anderssen was again generally regarded as the world&#x27;s leading active player.

Shortly after the tournament, he played a match against tournament runner-up Paulsen, ending in a draw (3 wins, 3 losses, 2 draws). In 1864, he drew another match (3 wins, 3 losses, and 2 draws) against Berthold Suhle, who was a strong player and respected chess writer.

===Steinitz match, 1866===
In 1866, Anderssen lost a close match with 30-year-old Wilhelm Steinitz (six wins, eight losses, and no draws; Steinitz won the last two games). Although Steinitz is now known for inventing the positional approach to chess and demonstrating its superiority, the 1866 match was played in the attack-at-all-costs style of the 1850s and 1860s. This is generally seen as the point at which Steinitz succeeded Anderssen as the world&#x27;s leading active player. Although ideas of a contest for the world championship had been floating around since the 1840s, the 1866 Anderssen–Steinitz match was not defined as being for the world championship, and many were opposed to the claim of such a title while Morphy was retired from chess and still alive. Furthermore, Anderssen remained dominant both in top tournaments and in personal matches against Zukertort until 1871.

===1866–1879===
By this time tournaments were becoming more frequent, and the round-robin format was adopted. At the same time, Anderssen, after losing the match to Morphy in 1858 and to Steinitz in 1866, re-dedicated himself to chess, particularly studying both endgames and positional play. The result was that Anderssen, in his early fifties, was playing the finest chess of his career. As a result, Anderssen compiled a very successful tournament record in the late stages of his career: five first places, two second places, two third places; and a sixth place in the final year of his life, when his health was failing. One of his first places was ahead of Steinitz, Gustav Neumann, Joseph Henry Blackburne, Louis Paulsen and several other very strong players at the Baden-Baden 1870 chess tournament. In terms of the number of leading players present, this could be regarded as one of the top 20 tournaments ever. One of Anderssen&#x27;s third places was at the strong Vienna 1873 tournament, when he was 55. About half of Anderssen&#x27;s tournament successes came at championships of the different regional German Chess Federations; but these were open to all nationalities, and most of them had a few &quot;top ten&quot; or even &quot;top five&quot; competitors. Anderssen usually beat Zukertort in matches, but his dominance came to an end in 1871.

The Leipzig 1877 tournament was organized in his honour and named the &quot;Anderssen-Feier&quot; (Anderssen Celebration); Anderssen finished second in the tournament behind Louis Paulsen.

Still at Leipzig, Anderssen lost a match against tournament winner Louis Paulsen (three wins, one draw, and five losses). Matches were Anderssen&#x27;s relative weakness; his only match win in this period was in 1868, against the 26-year-old Johann Zukertort (eight wins, one draw, and three losses).

==Assessment==

===Playing strength and style===

Anderssen was very successful in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878, taking first prize in over half of the events in which he played. His only recorded tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live. His match record was much weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six.

Though outclassed by Morphy, and to a lesser extent by Steinitz, Anderssen has been called the first modern chess master.

Arpad Elo, inventor of the Elo rating system, retroactively calculated ratings through history, and estimated that Anderssen was the first player with a rating over 2600. Chessmetrics ranks Anderssen as one of the top two players for most of the period from 1859 to 1873, and as the strongest player in the world seven months distributed between 1860 and 1870.

Steinitz rated Anderssen as one of the two greatest attacking players of his time: &quot;We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king&#x27;s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough.&quot; Although Anderssen is regarded as a member of the &quot;heroic&quot; attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: &quot;Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack&quot;, a principle more recently labelled &quot;Makogonov&#x27;s rule&quot;. According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.

Anderssen&#x27;s home town was so proud of him that in 1865 Breslau University awarded him an honorary doctorate.

===Influence on chess===
Due to the perceived beauty of its attacking style, some of Anderssen&#x27;s games, such as the Immortal Game and the Evergreen Game, are among the most famous in chess history.

The &quot;heroic&quot; attacking school of play to which Anderssen belonged was eclipsed by Steinitz&#x27; positional approach – by 1894 it was generally acknowledged that the only way to beat Steinitz was to apply Steinitz&#x27; principles.

Anderssen has had a more enduring influence on chess problem composition. He started composing in the last years of the &quot;Old School&quot;, whose compositions were fairly similar to realistic over-the-board positions and featured spectacular &quot;key&quot; moves, multiple sacrifices and few variations. He was one of the most skillful composers of his time, and his work forms an early stage of the &quot;Transition Period&quot;, between the mid-1840s and the early 1860s, when many of the basic problem ideas were discovered, the requirement for game-like positions was abandoned and the introduction of composing competitions (the first of which was in 1854) forced judges to decide on what features were the most desirable in a problem.

Outside the field of chess problems Anderssen was not a prolific author. However he edited the magazine &quot;Schachzeitung der Berliner Schachgesellschaft&quot; (later called &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot;) from 1846 to 1865, and was co-editor with Gustav Neumann of &quot;Neue Berliner Schachzeitung&quot; from 1864 to 1867.

===Personality===

Steinitz wrote: &quot;Anderssen was honest and honourable to the core. Without fear or favour he straightforwardly gave his opinion, and his sincere disinterestedness became so patent...that his word alone was usually sufficient to quell disputes...for he had often given his decision in favour of a rival...&quot; On the other hand, Reuben Fine, a 20th-century player, wrote, &quot;There is a curious contrast between his over-the-board brilliance and his uninspired safety-first attitude in everyday affairs.&quot;

==Death==
Anderssen died on 13 March 1879, in his home town. The &quot;Deutsche Schachzeitung&quot; noted his death in 1879 with a nineteen-page obituary. His cause of death was a heart attack. 
Bombing raids during World War II damaged his grave in Breslau. After the war, the city became part of Poland and is now known under its Polish name Wrocław. In 1957, the Polish Chess Federation decided to re-bury Anderssen in a new grave at the Osobowice Cemetery.

<text>Future Systems was a London-based architectural and design practice, formerly headed by Directors Jan Kaplický and Amanda Levete.

Future Systems was founded by Kaplický and David Nixon after working with Denys Lasdun, Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, and Richard Rogers in 1979. The work of Future Systems can be classified within the British high-tech architects as either bionic architecture or amorphous, organic shapes sometimes referred to as &quot;blobitecture&quot;. &quot;Compared to his peers, Kaplicky was the avant-garde incarnate, relentlessly pursuing the new new thing, refusing to settle into some predictable, and comfortable, architectural niche.&quot;

==Practice==
Future Systems proposals adapted construction methods from other professions, including (most commonly) the curved monocoque shell structures found in aircraft design, car design and boat building.

In the 1990s the company moved from theoretical projects to fee-paying work with projects such as the &quot;spacecraft-like&quot; Media Centre at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground in London (completed 1999), and the Selfridges Building (completed 2003). For Lord&#x27;s, Kaplicky received the Stirling Prize. The Selfridges department store is a prime example of the early 21st century movement referred to as &quot;blobitecture&quot;, and has been compared to Peter Cook&#x27;s Kunsthaus in Graz, Austria.

After Future Systems won the Stirling Prize, the firm received larger commissions including the Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena, Italy (2009) and the unbuilt new Czech National Library. In 2008 Kaplický and Levete split the firm. Kaplický took the firm name and some staff to the Czech Republic, and Levete would take a proposed new headquarters for News Corporation in east London and a commission for a hotel and retail complex in Bangkok, Thailand, along with most of the staff – between 35 and 45 people.

==History==

1979 Founded by Jan Kaplicky and David Nixon while working at Foster Associates.

1989 Joined by Amanda Levete who arrives from Richard Rogers &amp; Partners to become a partner.

1999 Won the Stirling Prize for Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground media centre.

2003 Completed the Selfridges building at the regenerated Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham.

2007 Won the commission for the controversial Czech National Library.

2008 Split into two practices after Kaplicky and Levete officially separate as business partners.

2008 Submits design of London Routemaster bus.

2008 Czech National Library project cancelled by Prague authorities.

2009 Jan Kaplický dies on 14 January 2009 in Prague, Czech Republic. A month later the final few staff working for Kaplický/Future Systems in Levete&#x27;s offices were let go.

<doc id="182525" wikidata="Q4971941" url="?curid=182525" title="Broad Street, Birmingham">
<text>Broad Street is a major thoroughfare and popular nightspot centre in Central Birmingham, England. Traditionally, Broad Street was considered to be outside Birmingham City Centre, but as the city centre expanded with the removal of the Inner Ring Road, Broad Street has been incorporated into the new Westside district of the city centre due to its position within the A4540 road.

Broad Street is also the centre of Birmingham&#x27;s banking and financial centre. It can boast region head offices of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and many other banking organisations. More than 15,000 people are employed in this sector, in this area of Birmingham.

==History==
===Early history===
In the 1500s, the area which is now known as Broad Street was made up of several schools and guilds such as The Biddles/Free School, Colmore, Shillon/Smallbrooke Guild/School, Billwiggler Croft and Byngas Hall which was later to become a home for the Lloyds Bank family and subsequently Bingley Hall and then Symphony Hall/ICC after Bingley Hall burned down.

In the 1750s, Broad Street was an unnamed country path that ran across Easy Hill from Bewdley Street (now Victoria Square) and Swinford Street (now the top end of New Street) to Five Ways and on to Stourbridge and Bewdley.

However, in the following years, Easy Hill began to develop with the construction of a house by John Baskerville, a local printer and type-face designer. This led to the widening of the street which passed in front of his house. The path was soon removed and an established street was added that ran to the border of Edgbaston and, as a result of its widening, it was named Broad Street.

St Martin&#x27;s Church owned land on the southern end of Broad Street, at what is now Five Ways, and began to develop the land in 1773 after the passing of an Act of Parliament. The site was developed into an estate known as the &#x27;Six Closes&#x27; or the &#x27;Islington Estate&#x27; (named after Islington Row which bounded the south of the site). The Crown Inn was built in 1781, and survives in modified form. By 1795, several streets had been created according to Pye&#x27;s map. One of the streets that remain from the development is Tennant Street, named after William Tennant who had the advowson of St Martin&#x27;s Church. Development slowed as a result of overseas wars, but rapidly increased after the Battle of Waterloo.

Land along the street also developed and became a well established neighbourhood as a result of the connections with industry and Edgbaston, an upmarket area. In the 19th century, well established industries were established along the canals at the northern end of the street and residential properties were built at the southern end. Churches of various denominations were also built along the stretch of Broad Street, such as the Unitarian Church of the Messiah, the Roman Catholic St Peter&#x27;s Church, and the Anglican Immanuel Church.

===Transformation===

In the 1970s and 1980s, Broad Street was still very much a suburban high street. However, one prescient early manifestation of the street&#x27;s future purpose as a fashionable partying district was the Rum Runner nightclub, which from the late 1970s restyled itself after New York City&#x27;s Studio 54 and later London&#x27;s Blitz club. The club was best known as the original home base of major 1980s band Duran Duran. It was situated on the South side at the East end of the road from 1964 to 1987 when it was demolished.

During the 1990s, Broad Street was transformed into a dynamic convention, entertainment and nightlife quarter, centred on the International Convention Centre, which opened in 1991.

The Broad Street area is home to numerous bars and restaurants, the Brindleyplace development and cultural attractions such as the Ikon Gallery.

Three major radio stations - Free Radio, Capital Birmingham and 100.7 Heart FM - have their studios on the street. From 1969 to 1999 the area was a major national television production facility. The junction with Paradise Circus was home to the studios of former ITV companies ATV and Central; the studios (on the land between the Alpha Tower and the former Birmingham Municipal Bank) have since been demolished.

===Traffic and transport===
There is long standing concern over traffic congestion in the evenings when car drivers attracted by the nightlife are cruising the area. There was a proposal to ban cars during Friday and Saturday evenings and in 1998 there was a plan to ban cars every evening after 8.00 pm.

Broad Street is served by several National Express West Midlands bus routes. The road&#x27;s only night bus service ceased in 2008.

The West Midlands Metro was extended along Broad Street to Five Ways between 2015 and 2019 with stops at Birmingham Library, Brindleyplace and Five Ways. The proposed SPRINT bus rapid transit route between Birmingham and Quinton would also serve Broad Street.

==Buildings and other structures==
At its northern end is:

*Centenary Square, with
**Baskerville House
**Hall of Memory
**Library of Birmingham
**The old Masonic Hall, later Central Television – &quot;(demolished 2008)&quot;
**The Birmingham Municipal Bank, the first municipal bank in the country, later Lloyds TSB, then bought by the council for redevelopment
**The Boulton, Watt and Murdoch statue

*Hyatt Regency Birmingham Hotel.
*Quayside Tower
*Jury&#x27;s Inn hotel

The bridge crossing the Birmingham Canal was renamed the Black Sabbath Bridge in 2019, named after the rock group where all four members grew up in the local area. It includes a bench designed by fan Mohammed Osam, featuring avatars of the group members.

===Walk of Stars===
A &#x27;Walk of Stars&#x27;, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, runs along the pavement on Broad Street. Ozzy Osbourne, of the Aston area of Birmingham, became the first person to be honoured when he had his brass star installed on 6 July 2007. Since then comedian Jasper Carrott, glam rocker Noddy Holder, motor racing commentator Murray Walker, the cast and crew of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Archers&quot;, long serving &quot;Archers&quot; cast member Norman Painting and founding member of Black Sabbath, Tony Iommi have all been honoured on the street with a star. Other famous local people nominated to do the same include Frank Skinner, Cat Deeley and Duran Duran a group that at the start of the 1980s based themselves in the Rum Runner nightclub situated in Broad Street but which has subsequently been knocked down to make way for the Hyatt Hotel.

===Future buildings===
Developments planned for the street include Broad Street Tower, Regal Tower, V Building and a redevelopment of Five Ways Shopping Centre.

<text>Henry Edward Bird (14 July 1829 – 11 April 1908) was an English chess player, author and accountant. He wrote the books &quot;Chess History and Reminiscences&quot; and &quot;An Analysis of Railways in the United Kingdom&quot;.

Although Bird was a practising accountant, not a professional chess player, it has been said that he &quot;lived for chess, and would play anybody anywhere, any time, under any conditions.&quot;

==Tournament play==
At age 21, Bird was invited to the first international tournament, London 1851. He also participated in tournaments held in Vienna and New York City. In 1858 he lost a match to Paul Morphy at age 28, yet he played high-level chess for another 50 years. In the New York tournament of 1876, Bird received the first ever awarded, for his game against James Mason.

==Legacy==

In 1874 Bird proposed a new chess variant, which played on an 8×10 board and contained two new pieces: &quot;guard&quot; (combining the moves of the rook and knight) and &quot;equerry&quot; (combining the bishop and knight). Bird&#x27;s chess inspired José Raúl Capablanca to create another chess variant, Capablanca Chess, which would ultimately differ from Bird&#x27;s chess only by the starting position.

It was Bird who popularised the chess opening now called Bird&#x27;s Opening (1.f4), as well as Bird&#x27;s Defence to the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 Nd4). Bird&#x27;s Opening is considered sound, though not the best try for an opening advantage. Bird&#x27;s Defence is regarded as slightly inferior, but &quot;&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Alexander Rae Baldwin III was born on April 3, 1958, in Amityville, New York, and raised in the Nassau Shores neighborhood of nearby Massapequa, the eldest son of Carol Newcomb (&quot;née&quot; Martineau; December 15, 1929 – May 26, 2022) from Syracuse, New York and Alexander Rae Baldwin Jr. (October 26, 1927 – April 15, 1983), a high school history/social studies teacher and football coach from Brooklyn. His maternal grandfather, Daniel Roy Martineau, played football at Syracuse and later played professionally in the National Football League for the Buffalo All-Americans and the Rochester Jeffersons. He has three younger brothers, Daniel (b. 1960), William (b. 1963), and Stephen (b. 1966), who also became actors. He also has two sisters, Elizabeth &quot;Beth&quot; Baldwin Keuchler (b. 1955) and Jane Ann Baldwin Sasso (b. 1965).

Alec and his siblings were raised as Catholics. They are of Irish, French, and English ancestry. Through his father, Baldwin is descended from &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Howland, and through this line, is the 13th generation of his family born in North America and the 14th generation to live in North America.

Baldwin attended Alfred G. Berner High School in Massapequa and played football there under Coach Bob Reifsnyder. In New York City, Baldwin worked as a busboy at the famed discotheque, Studio 54. From 1976 to 1979, he attended George Washington University.

Afterward, he transferred to the Tisch School of the Arts of New York University (NYU) where he studied with, among others, Geoffrey Horne and Mira Rostova at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. Later, he was accepted as a member of the Actors Studio. In 1994, he completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at NYU.

==Career==
=== 1980–1992: Rise to prominence ===

Baldwin&#x27;s first acting role was as Billy Aldrich in the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot; from August 20, 1980, to 1982. In the fall of 1983, he starred in the short-lived television series &quot;Cutter to Houston&quot;. The actor made his TV movie debut playing the titular Sheriff Ed Cassaday in &quot;The Sheriff and the Astronaut&quot; (1984). He went on to appear as the brother of Valene Ewing and son of Lilimae Clements (played by Joan Van Ark and Julie Harris, respectively) in &quot;Knots Landing&quot; from 1984 to 1985. In 1986, Baldwin starred in &quot;Dress Gray&quot;, a four-hour made-for-television miniseries, as an honest cadet sergeant who tries to solve the mystery of a murdered gay classmate. Baldwin made his Broadway debut in 1986 in a revival of Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;Loot&quot; alongside Zoë Wanamaker, Željko Ivanek, Joseph Maher, and Charles Keating. This production closed after three months.

Baldwin made his feature film debut with a minor role in the 1987 comedy-mystery &quot;Forever, Lulu&quot;. In 1988, he rose to prominence acting in five major films. He starred in Tim Burton fantasy horror comedy &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988) opposite Michael Keaton and Geena Davis. He had supporting roles in the Mike Nichols romantic comedy &quot;Working Girl&quot; and Jonathan Demme&#x27;s crime comedy &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;. He also co-starred in Oliver Stone&#x27;s drama &quot;Talk Radio&quot; opposite Eric Bogosian and in the John Hughes romantic drama &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; with Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern.

He gained further recognition as a leading man with his role as Jack Ryan in &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990). That same year, he also starred in the black comedy crime film &quot;Miami Blues&quot; alongside Jennifer Jason Leigh and Fred Ward. Baldwin met his future wife Kim Basinger when they played lovers in the 1991 film &quot;The Marrying Man&quot;. Next, Baldwin played a ferocious sales executive in &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; (1992), a part added to the film version of David Mamet&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play (including the monologue &quot;Coffee&#x27;s for closers&quot;). Later that same year, he starred in &quot;Prelude to a Kiss&quot; with Meg Ryan, which was based on the Broadway play. The film received a lukewarm reception by critics and grossed only $22 million worldwide.

=== 1993–2005: Established actor ===
He appeared with Basinger again in &quot;The Getaway&quot;, a 1994 remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen film of the same name. Also, in 1994, Baldwin made a foray into pulp fiction-based movies with the role of the title character in &quot;The Shadow&quot;. The film made $48 million. In 1996 and 1997, he starred in several more thrillers, including &quot;The Edge&quot;, &quot;The Juror&quot;, and &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot;. His other Broadway credits include Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Serious Money&quot; with Kate Nelligan and a revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, for which his performance as Stanley Kowalski garnered a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor. Baldwin also received an Emmy nomination for the 1995 television version of the production, in which both he and Jessica Lange reprised their roles, alongside John Goodman and Diane Lane. In 1998, Baldwin played the title role in &quot;Macbeth&quot; at The Public Theater alongside Angela Bassett and Liev Schreiber in a production directed by George C. Wolfe. From 1998 to 2002, he became the third American narrator and George Carlin&#x27;s replacement for the fifth and sixth seasons of &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. Baldwin wrote an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; entitled &quot;Tabloid&quot;, which aired in 1998. In 2000, he played Mr. Conductor in the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;. In 2002, he acted in &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;.

In 2002, Baldwin appeared in two episodes of &quot;Friends&quot; as Phoebe&#x27;s overly enthusiastic love interest, Parker. He also portrayed a recurring character in several seasons 7 and 8 episodes of &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, in which he played Malcolm, a &quot;top secret agent&quot; and the lover of Karen Walker (Megan Mullally). He also guest-starred in the first live episode of the series. He played Dr. Barrett Moore, a retired plastic surgeon, in the series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;. Baldwin shifted towards character acting, beginning with &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; in 2001. He played Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle in the film. With a worldwide box office of $449,220,945, this film remains the highest-grossing film Baldwin has appeared in during his acting career. Baldwin directed and starred in &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; with Anthony Hopkins, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Dan Aykroyd in 2001. The then-unreleased film became an asset in a federal bank fraud trial when investor Jed Barron was convicted of bank fraud while the movie was in production. The film was eventually acquired by The Yari Group without Baldwin&#x27;s involvement.

Baldwin was nominated for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor for his performance in the 2003 gambling drama &quot;The Cooler&quot;. He received acclaim for the role with Roger Ebert writing, &quot; This is one of Alec Baldwin&#x27;s best performances, as a character who contains vast contradictions. He can be kind and brutal simultaneously; affection and cruelty are handmaidens&quot;. Baldwin collaborated with Martin Scorsese portraying Juan Trippe in the biographical drama &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004) and Capt. George Ellerby in the crime drama &quot;The Departed&quot; (2006). In 2004, Baldwin starred in a revival of Broadway&#x27;s &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; about a successful and egomaniacal Broadway director (Baldwin), who has transformed a chorus girl (Anne Heche) into a leading lady. Charles Isherwood of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the production a mixed review writing of Baldwin&#x27;s performance, &quot;Baldwin is an earthy actor with a natural contemporary style, and his hoity-toity faux-British accent sounds more off-key than it should&quot;.

On June 9, 2005, he appeared in a concert version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;South Pacific&quot; at Carnegie Hall. He starred as Luther Billis, alongside Reba McEntire as Nellie and Brian Stokes Mitchell as Emile. PBS taped and telecast the production on April 26, 2006. In 2006, he starred in the film &quot;Mini&#x27;s First Time&quot;. He performed opposite Sarah Michelle Gellar in &quot;Suburban Girl&quot; (2007).

=== 2006–2013: Career resurgence with &quot;30 Rock&quot; ===

In 2006, Baldwin made theater news in Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s Off-Broadway revival of Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot;. In 2010, Baldwin starred opposite Sam Underwood in a critically acclaimed revival of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Equus&quot;, directed by Tony Walton at Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York. In 2007, the Yari Film Group announced that it would give the film, now titled &quot;Shortcut to Happiness&quot;, a theatrical release in the spring, and cable film network Starz! announced that it had acquired pay TV rights for the film. &quot;Shortcut to Happiness&quot; was finally released in 2008. Baldwin displeased with the way the film had been cut in post-production, demanded that his directorial credit be changed to the pseudonym &quot;Harry Kirkpatrick&quot;.

He starred as Jack Donaghy on NBC&#x27;s &quot;30 Rock&quot;, which first aired in October 2006. He met his future co-stars Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan while appearing on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; Since season 3, Baldwin was credited as one of &quot;30 Rock&quot;″s producers. Barry Garron of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Baldwin&#x27;s character writing, &quot;Donaghy is a perfect example of what&#x27;s right with this show.&quot; Baldwin has won three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, two Golden Globe awards and seven Screen Actors Guild Awards for his role. He received his second Emmy nomination in 2008, marking his seventh Primetime Emmy nomination and first win. He won again in 2009.

Baldwin co-authored the book &quot;A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce&quot; with Mark Tabb in 2008. Baldwin joined TCM&#x27;s &quot;The Essentials&quot; Robert Osborne as co-host beginning in March 2009. In 2008, he had a voice role as the main antagonist in the DreamWorks Animated film &quot;&quot;. In 2009, he appeared in a series of commercials for Hulu that premiered during the Super Bowl broadcast. On January 12, 2009, Baldwin became the host of &quot;The New York Philharmonic This Week&quot;, the nationally syndicated radio series of the New York Philharmonic. He has recorded two nationally distributed public service radio announcements on behalf of the Save the Manatee Club. In 2010, he made a five-second cameo appearance with comedian Andy Samberg in a musical video titled &quot;Great Day&quot; featured on the bonus DVD as part of Lonely Island&#x27;s album &quot;Turtleneck &amp; Chain&quot;.
Baldwin co-starred in the hit romantic comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; (2009) with Meryl Streep and Steve Martin. Together Streep and Baldwin received positive reviews for their on-screen chemistry. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Mr. Baldwin does with Jake, who, with his shark smiles and thrusting gut, beautifully conveys male vanity in its twilight&quot;. Kirk Honeycut of &quot;The Associated Press&quot; wrote, &quot;Baldwin has developed a second career in films and television by more or less spoofing his macho image&quot;. Baldwin went on to receive a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. That same year, Baldwin co-hosted the 82nd Academy Awards with Steve Martin in 2010. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; television critic Matthew Gilbert lauded the hosts performance saying that &quot;The delivery was expert and warmly conversational, like one of those old-school comedy teams.&quot;

He has hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; 17 times , and holds the record for most times hosting the show. On October 24, 2011, WNYC public radio released the first episode of Baldwin&#x27;s podcast &quot;Here&#x27;s the Thing&quot;, a series of interviews with public figures including artists, policy-makers, and performers. The first two episodes featured actor Michael Douglas and political consultant Ed Rollins. Between 2011 and 2020, Baldwin completed more than 150 interviews, with guests who included musician Wynton Marsalis, filmmaker Edward Norton, comedian David Letterman, violinist Itzhak Perlman, and pianist Lang Lang, among many others. &quot;Here&#x27;s the Thing&quot; was developed for Baldwin by Lu Olkowski, Trey Kay, Kathy Russo, and Emily Botein. On February 4, 2012, he hosted the 2011 NFL Honors awards show. He later hosted the second show on February 2, 2013.

Baldwin returned to Broadway as Harold in &quot;Orphans&quot;. The show, which opened April 18, 2013, was also to have starred Shia LaBeouf as Treat, but LaBeouf left the production in rehearsals and was replaced by Ben Foster. Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; described Baldwin&#x27;s performance as being &quot;executed with humor and compassion&quot;. That same year Baldwin briefly hosted &quot;Up Late with Alec Baldwin&quot; on MSNBC. On November 26, 2013, the program was cancelled after only five episodes, due in part to a street tirade captured on video, in which he allegedly called the videographer a &quot;cocksucking fag&quot;. Baldwin denied that he used the word &quot;fag&quot;, and later cited this incident as a major turning point in his public life. Beginning in 2010, Baldwin appeared in a television campaign for Capital One as their spokesperson. Following the 2013 confrontation with a videographer, his contract was not renewed, and he was succeeded in the campaign by Jennifer Garner.

=== 2014–present ===
Baldwin co-starred in &quot;&quot;, the fifth installment of the &quot;&quot; series, released on July 31, 2015, and reprised the role in &quot;&quot;, released on July 27, 2018.

That same year Baldwin gained acclaim and notoriety for his portrayal of Republican nominee Donald Trump during &quot;SNL&quot; coverage of the 2016 presidential election, to critical acclaim. In 2017, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his portrayal of Trump. Baldwin continued in the role until Trump&#x27;s defeat in the 2020 election.

In 2017, he took over as sole host of TCM&#x27;s &quot;The Essentials&quot; following the death of his co-host, Robert Osborne. In August 2017, Baldwin&#x27;s production company, El Dorado Pictures, signed a first-look deal with ABC Studios. His 2017 memoir &quot;Nevertheless&quot; debuted at No. 5 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; hardcover nonfiction best-seller list. On March 3, 2018, following the broadcast of the 90th Academy Awards, ABC broadcast a preview episode of the talk show &quot;The Alec Baldwin Show&quot;, at the time called &quot;Sundays With Alec Baldwin&quot;, scheduled to formally debut with a nine-episode order that fall. On August 27, 2018, it was announced that Baldwin would join the cast for &quot;&quot;Joker&quot;&quot;, playing Thomas Wayne, father of Bruce Wayne. Later, on August 29, 2018, Baldwin withdrew from the role.

==Acting credits and accolades==

Baldwin has also received a number of awards and nominations throughout his career for stage, television, and film roles. He has been nominated for the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Tony Award and has received three Primetime Emmy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and eight Screen Actors Guild Awards.

On May 12, 2010, Baldwin gave a commencement address at New York University and was awarded a Doctor of Fine Arts degree, honoris causa.

Baldwin was named Esteemed Faculty by Stony Brook University after teaching a master class in acting at Stony Brook Southampton.

== Philanthropy ==
Baldwin and his mother Carol created the Carol M. Baldwin Cancer Research Fund in 1996, and dedicated the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center at the Stony Brook University Hospital in her honor. During his 2010–2013 stint as a spokesperson for Capital One, Baldwin&#x27;s contract was written to fund Baldwin&#x27;s charity foundation. He was paid $15 million over nearly five years. After taxes and accounting fees, the remainder, $14.125 million, was given to charity.

In March 2011, Baldwin donated $1 million to the New York Philharmonic (on whose board he served), and $500,000 to the Roundabout Theatre Company, where he has performed plays in New York. In recent years, his foundation has donated bookstore gift certificates to Long Island libraries to support literacy programs.

==Personal life==
Baldwin was briefly engaged in 1983 to actress Janine Turner. He also dated Lori Loughlin, Lori Singer, Holly Gagnier and Jennifer Love Hewitt.

===Marriages===
====Kim Basinger====
In 1990, Baldwin met actress Kim Basinger when they played lovers in the film &quot;The Marrying Man&quot;. They married on August 19, 1993, and had a daughter, Ireland (born October 23, 1995). They separated on December 5, 2000 and divorced on September 3, 2002. Baldwin has called the attorneys in the case &quot;opportunists&quot;, and characterized Basinger&#x27;s psychologists as part of the &quot;divorce industry&quot;. In his memoir, he blamed them more than Basinger, writing, &quot;She is a person, like many of us, doing the best she can with what she has.&quot;

In his memoir, Baldwin stated that these issues placed stress on his relationship with his daughter. Baldwin wrote that he had to spend over a million dollars, put time aside from his career, travel extensively, and find a house in California, having previously lived in New York, in order to stay in his daughter&#x27;s life.

On April 11, 2007, he left a voicemail message in response to an unanswered arranged call, in which he called his 11-year-old daughter a &quot;rude, thoughtless little pig&quot;. The tape was sold to TMZ, which published the recording despite laws against publishing media related to a minor without the permission of both parents. Baldwin described the incident as a mistake that did not make him a bad parent. During an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; in June 2009, he stated that he contemplated suicide after the voicemail leaked to the public but sought professional help. He stated that he felt Basinger would have considered it &quot;a victory&quot; if he committed suicide and that it was her &quot;avowed goal&quot; to destroy him.

In late 2008, Baldwin toured in support of his book on fatherhood and divorce, speaking about his experiences related in it.
====Hilaria Baldwin====
By August 2011, Baldwin began dating Hilaria Thomas, a yoga instructor with Yoga Vida in Manhattan. Baldwin and Thomas moved from the Upper West Side to Greenwich Village that August. The couple became engaged in April 2012 and married on June 30, 2012, at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral in New York City. They have seven children together. The Baldwin family have taped a reality show, &quot;The Baldwins,&quot; set to air on TLC in 2025.

===Health and dieting===

Baldwin and his wife are pescatarians who eat a predominantly plant-based diet with fish and eggs. Baldwin gave up eating beef in 1991 and is a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. In 2019, he authored an article for CNN supporting the EAT-Lancet report and recommended a plant-based diet due to global environmental issues.

Baldwin has discussed his experiences with Lyme disease.

=== 2021 shooting incident ===

On October 21, 2021, Baldwin was filming on the set of the upcoming film &quot;Rust&quot;, of which he was also a producer, at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when he discharged a gun being used as a prop, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. This was reported in the press as the Rust shooting incident. The Hutchins family filed a wrongful death suit against Baldwin for his part in the fatal shooting. On October 5, 2022, Baldwin reached an undisclosed settlement with Hutchins&#x27; family in their wrongful death lawsuit.

On January 19, 2023, Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies announced that Baldwin would be charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter by the end of the month. He was charged on January 31, 2023. The elevated second charge was eventually dropped after his lawyers argued that he was being incorrectly charged with a version of the law that was not passed until months after the shooting, meaning that if he was found guilty, he would have faced a maximum of 18 months in prison. On February 23, he pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter.

In April 2023, lawyers for Baldwin announced that the criminal charges against him had been dropped by prosecutors. In a statement, Baldwin&#x27;s attorneys said &quot;We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.&quot; On October 17, 2023, New Mexico special prosecutors would announce that their findings indicated that Baldwin may be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. &quot;Rust&quot; completed filming in May 2023 and is currently in post-production. In 2023, Baldwin has been associated with four other film projects including &quot;Supercell&quot;, &quot;97 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Atrabilious&quot; and &quot;Billie&#x27;s Magic World&quot;. He also appeared in a cameo on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in October 2023, in an episode hosted by Timothée Chalamet, making it one of his first live appearances since the &quot;Rust&quot; incident and first appearance on the show since 2020.

In January 2024, a grand jury indicted Baldwin on an involuntary manslaughter charge. The indictment provides prosecutors with two options for pursuing this charge: one based on negligent use of a firearm, and the other for felony misconduct &quot;with the total disregard or indifference for the safety of others.&quot; On May 24, 2024, Santa Fe-based Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied a motion which was filed by Baldwin to dismiss his trial, thus clearing the way for the trial to begin. Baldwin&#x27;s trial would begin in Santa Fe, New Mexico on July 9, 2024, with 12 jurors and four alternative jurors being selected. Opening statements would then get underway on July 10.

On July 12, 2024, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case against Baldwin with prejudice, upholding a motion filed by the defense to dismiss the case following the revelation that the prosecution withheld evidence from the defense. Sommer found that &quot;Santa Fe County Sheriff&#x27;s officer made the decision — and apparently also with the prosecutor ... that the evidence was of no evidentiary value and failed to connect the evidence to the case&quot;, such that the &quot;willful withholding of this information was intentional and deliberate&quot;, displaying &quot;signs of scorching prejudice&quot;. On October 25, 2024, Judge Sommer upheld her dismissal of the involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin, ruling that the prosecution failed to raise any factual or legal arguments which would&#x27;ve justified reversing her decision.

==Political views==
Baldwin is a Democrat and endorsed Barack Obama in his two presidential campaigns. He serves on the board of People for the American Way. He is an animal rights activist and a staunch supporter of PETA, for which he has done work that includes narrating the video entitled &quot;Meet Your Meat&quot;. Baldwin lent his support to the Save the Manatee Club by donating his time to record several public service announcements for the group, which had contacted him following his role in &quot;The Bonfire of the Manatees&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in which he was the voice of a biologist working to save the endangered mammals. Baldwin also gave his support for Farm Sanctuary&#x27;s Adopt A Turkey Project and stated, &quot;At least 46 million turkeys suffer heartbreaking fear and pain before being killed each and every Thanksgiving...&quot;

In a couple of letters to &quot;The East Hampton Star&quot; in 1998, he called New York Governor George Pataki either a liar or incredibly stupid and asked whether Kenneth Star was a psychopath.

During his appearance on the comedy late night show &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on December 11, 1998, eight days before President Bill Clinton was to be impeached, Baldwin gave a staged rant, meant as satire, &quot;If we were in another country ... we would stone Henry Hyde to death and we would go to their homes and kill their wives and their children. We would kill their families, for what they&#x27;re doing to this country.&quot; At the end of his rant, O&#x27;Brien pulled out an oxygen mask and put it over Baldwin&#x27;s mouth to calm Baldwin down. Baldwin later apologized to Hyde for any misunderstanding, and the network explained that it was meant as a joke and promised not to re-run it.

Baldwin said in a 2006 interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; that if he did become involved in electoral politics, he would prefer to run for Governor of New York. When asked if he was qualified for the office, Baldwin responded that he considered himself more qualified than California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. On December 21, 2011, Baldwin, addressing speculation, said he was abandoning plans to run for mayor of New York City and would instead continue in his role on &quot;30 Rock&quot;. That April, he suggested he might change his mind, saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s see what things are like in 2014. I would love to do it.&quot;

In February 2009, Baldwin spoke out to encourage state leaders to renew New York&#x27;s tax break for the film and television industry, stating that if the &quot;tax breaks are not reinstated into the budget, film production in this town is going to collapse and television production is going to collapse and it&#x27;s all going to go to California&quot;.

During the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2011, televised by Fox, Baldwin was slated to appear in a taped skit. However, the producers of the show cut a portion of the skit containing a reference to Rupert Murdoch and the News International phone hacking scandal. Baldwin subsequently boycotted the Emmy Awards and requested that his entire appearance be removed from the broadcast. Producers complied and he was replaced with Leonard Nimoy.

He has made appearances in several seasons of truTV&#x27;s &quot;The Smoking Gun Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot;

In 2014, Baldwin appeared on the first episode of &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;. His girlfriend swapped with the wife of Jermaine Jackson.

On August 27, 2015, Baldwin entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; (also known as &quot;Celebrity Big Brother: UK vs USA&quot;) house as a contestant representing the USA. On September 4, he was the first housemate evicted; he had lasted nine days.

==Personal life==

===Relationships and family===
Baldwin had a daughter, filmmaker Kahlea (b. 1984), with his first wife, Cheryl. Baldwin and second wife Elizabeth had a daughter named Alexandra (b. 1994). Following the couple&#x27;s divorce, Baldwin was involved in a lengthy relationship with his &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street&quot; co-star, Isabella Hofmann. They have a son, Atticus, (b. 1996), who is named after the lawyer in &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, and has autism. Baldwin next was married to Joanne Smith, a former British model, with whom he had daughter Avis Ann on January 17, 2008. The couple&#x27;s second child, daughter Finley Rae Martineau Baldwin, was born August 7, 2009. In 2011, Baldwin and his wife announced that they had dropped their divorce filings and were attempting to reconcile. However, in 2012, Joanne filed for divorce again. In November 2014, Baldwin announced his engagement to Robin Sue Hertz Hempel, an entrepreneur. They called off their engagement in 2020. On December 31, 2022, Baldwin married D&#x27;Asia Bellamy. Their wedding ceremony took place in Iglesias, Sardinia, Italy. The couple&#x27;s first child, son William &quot;Bat&quot; Baldwin, was born on June 1, 2023.

In June 2017, Baldwin relocated to Cleveland, New York, to be closer to extended family. He joined WTLA in Syracuse in September 2017 and left the station in April 2019, stating that he had accomplished what he wanted to do with the radio show.

===Addiction and arrests===

In 1998, Baldwin was found running naked through the halls of New York&#x27;s Plaza Hotel shouting his own last name and was arrested for possession of cocaine. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to three months in drug rehab. He later told &quot;People magazine&quot; that he had been battling cocaine addiction since 1989.

On April 22, 2006, Baldwin was arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia in a Santa Monica hotel.

He was arrested again on July 19, 2006. According to the police, Baldwin ran a red light after weaving through the traffic in West L.A. just before 1 pm, then crashed his rented Ford Thunderbird into two parked cars while going in a zone. Jason Lee, a spokesman for the Los Angeles police, said: &quot;The Thunderbird pushed one of the vehicles about , and that was a Hummer.&quot; Police say Baldwin was driving with a suspended license at the time of the crash. He was transferred to UCLA Medical Center with back and neck injuries but did not appear to be seriously hurt.

On November 7, 2006, Baldwin was arrested in Santa Monica, California, after allegedly stealing a white GMC Yukon SUV. The actor was taken to jail and booked for investigation of grand theft auto; bail was set at $20,000. &quot;The car belongs to an acquaintance of Mr. Baldwin, but he had no permission to take it&quot;, said Jim Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The charges were subsequently dropped.

On February 6, 2007, an arrest warrant was issued for Baldwin in Newport Beach, California, by the Orange County Superior Court for his failure to show up for an arraignment stemming from an auto-theft charge. 

Baldwin starred on the VH1 reality television show &quot;Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew,&quot; filmed in 2007, but left the show after the fourth episode. His stated reasons for leaving included having a prior commitment to an acting job and the others&#x27; behavior interfering with his recovery. It was eventually reported that he left because of inappropriate text messages he had sent to Mary Carey, a fellow patient in his treatment group.

==Early life==
Baldwin was born in Massapequa, New York, the youngest son of Carol Newcomb (née Martineau), founder of The Baldwin Fund, and Alexander Rae Baldwin Jr., a high school social studies teacher and football coach. Baldwin&#x27;s elder brothers are actors Alec, Daniel and William, they are all known collectively known as the &quot;Baldwin brothers&quot;. He was raised in the Catholic faith. In high school, Baldwin participated on the varsity wrestling team, along with William. Baldwin has two elder sisters, Elizabeth Keuchler and Jane Sasso. Baldwin attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

==Career==

Baldwin began acting on television and made his film debut in &quot;The Beast&quot;. He starred in the western television series &quot;The Young Riders&quot; and in &quot;Threesome&quot; (1994). Baldwin landed a breakthrough role in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; (1995) and played Barney Rubble in &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot; (2000). He participated in &quot;Celebrity Mole Hawaii&quot;, the first celebrity edition of &quot;The Mole&quot; in 2002. ABC broadcast the program in early 2003. Later that year, he returned for &quot;Celebrity Mole Yucatán&quot;, which ABC aired in early 2004. In 2006, Baldwin played a villainous thug in the television film &quot;Jesse Stone: Night Passage&quot;. In August 2007, Baldwin returned to television, when CMT cast him in &quot;Ty Murray&#x27;s Celebrity Bull Riding Challenge&quot;, one of nine celebrities cast. In the first episode, Baldwin was injured in a bad fall from a wooden pontoon, breaking his shoulder blade and cracking a rib. Under doctor&#x27;s orders, he left the show in the second episode. From January to March 2008, Baldwin appeared on Donald Trump&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; on NBC. He finished fifth out of the 14 celebrity contestants. He and Trace Adkins became friends while competing on the show. In October 2008, Baldwin appeared in Adkins&#x27;s music video, &quot;Muddy Water&quot;. In March 2013, Baldwin returned to compete in &quot;All-Star Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. He was a contestant on the 2009 NBC reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity…Get Me out of Here!&quot;. Baldwin quit the show mid-season. On the second episode, he baptized &quot;The Hills&quot; actor Spencer Pratt. In 2019, Baldwin starred in a Filipino film, &quot;Kaibigan.&quot;

==Personal life==

Baldwin resides in the village of Nyack, New York, with his wife, the Brazilian graphic designer Kennya Baldwin (née Deodato), whom he met in 1987 and married in 1990. They have two daughters, Alaia and Hailey Bieber; both are models. His father-in-law is Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato, and Canadian singer Justin Bieber is his son-in-law through marriage to his daughter Hailey. Through his daughters, Alaia and Hailey, Baldwin has two grandchildren.

In 2006, Baldwin launched a campaign to prevent an adult bookstore from opening in Nyack. He has a tattoo on his left shoulder of the initials &quot;HM&quot; for Hannah Montana. He got the tattoo after making a pact with Miley Cyrus that he would be allowed to cameo on the show if he had the initials tattooed on him. He revealed the tattoo to Cyrus at a book signing in Nashville on November 10, 2008. He was never given the opportunity to appear on the show and has since said that he regrets getting the tattoo.

In June 2009, Baldwin&#x27;s foreclosed $515,000, 1.4-acre home in Rockland County, New York was publicly auctioned after he and his wife defaulted on more than $824,000 in mortgage payments. In July, Baldwin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection claiming more than $2.3 million in debt. Court papers showed he owed $1.2 million on two mortgages on a New York property valued at only $1.1 million, more than $1 million in taxes and credit card debt.

Baldwin was the first person to enter the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house on January 3, 2010. The theme for this series was &quot;Hell&quot;, with a devil head on the front door. He frequently taunted the head by saying &quot;you&#x27;re a loser&quot;. During his stay in the house, he frequently read passages from the Bible to his fellow housemates. He failed to win many fans and was evicted on January 22, 2010, becoming the fourth housemate to be evicted. In a three-way vote—against Ivana Trump and Sisqó—he received 50% of the public vote. After his eviction, the website restorestephenbaldwin.org, unsolicited by him, began soliciting cash donations to improve Baldwin&#x27;s career.

In December 2010, Baldwin filed a $3.8 million lawsuit against Kevin Costner over oil-separating technology that was used to help solve the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In June 2012, a jury sided with Costner and awarded Baldwin no damages. In March 2013, Baldwin pleaded guilty to failing to file income taxes for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. He stated that he never intended to avoid paying taxes and that he had received bad advice from lawyers and accountants. Baldwin agreed to pay $300,000 within a year, or he would be sentenced to five years&#x27; probation and have five years to pay the money.

==Views==
=== Religion ===

In September 2006, Baldwin released his book titled &quot;The Unusual Suspect&quot;, which details highlights from his personal life, career, days of drug abuse and his turn to becoming a born-again Evangelical after the September 11 attacks in 2001. In the same year, Baldwin, Mario D&#x27;Ortenzio, and Bobby Brewer founded Breakthrough Ministry, which was designed to use extreme sports as a ministry via arena tours, called AsSalt Tours. The tours featured extreme sports celebrities, including Christian Hosoi.

In late 2008, Baldwin formed a for-profit organization called Antioch Ministry, which exists &quot;to facilitate the gifts and calling of Stephen Baldwin.&quot; In 2009, Baldwin launched a third ministry called Now More Than Ever, designed to reach enlisted men and women in the U.S. armed services around the world. In 2008, Baldwin teamed up with conservative talk-radio host Kevin McCullough to put together a Saturday radio show called &quot;Baldwin/McCullough Radio&quot;. As of April 18, 2009, the show aired on 213 stations and in more than 400 cities across the US and worldwide on Sirius 161 and XM 227. Baldwin appears weekly on the show from the broadcast studios in New York City and from various locations around the country when he is traveling for other business purposes.

=== Politics ===

In 2007, Baldwin endorsed Sam Brownback for U.S. president. After Brownback ended his campaign, Baldwin switched his support to Mike Huckabee. Baldwin was an outspoken advocate of the John McCain–Sarah Palin presidential ticket after Huckabee dropped out of the 2008 presidential election.

In 2011, Baldwin mentioned the possibility of entering New York City&#x27;s 2013 mayoral election as an opponent of his brother Alec, who had suggested that he might run himself.

Baldwin was among the first Hollywood celebrities to endorse Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

<doc id="182538" wikidata="Q19889" url="?curid=182538" title="West Coast Main Line">
<text>The West Coast Main Line (WCML) is one of the most important railway corridors in the United Kingdom, connecting the major cities of London and Glasgow with branches to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Edinburgh. It is one of the busiest mixed-traffic railway routes in Europe, carrying a mixture of intercity rail, regional rail, commuter rail and rail freight traffic. The core route of the WCML runs from London to Glasgow for approx. and was opened from 1837 to 1881. With additional lines deviating to Northampton, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Edinburgh, this totals a route mileage of . The Glasgow–Edinburgh via Carstairs line connects the WCML to Edinburgh. However, the main London–Edinburgh route is the East Coast Main Line. Several sections of the WCML form part of the suburban railway systems in London, Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow, with many more smaller commuter stations, as well as providing links to more rural towns.

It is one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying 40% of all UK rail freight traffic. The line is the principal rail freight corridor linking the European mainland (via the Channel Tunnel) through London and South East England to the West Midlands, North West England and Scotland. The line has been declared a strategic European route and designated a priority Trans-European Networks (TENS) route. A number of railway writers refer to it as &quot;The Premier line&quot;.

The WCML was not originally conceived as a single route, but was built as a patchwork of local lines which were linked together, built by various companies, the largest of which amalgamated in 1846 to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), which then gradually absorbed most of the others; the exceptions were the Caledonian Railway in Scotland, and the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) which both remained independent until 1923. The core route was mostly built between the 1830s and 1850s, but several cut-off routes and branches were built in later decades. In 1923, the entire route came under the ownership of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) when the railway companies were grouped under the Railways Act 1921. The LMS itself was nationalised in 1947 to form part of British Railways (BR). 

As the WCML is the most important long-distance railway trunk route in the UK, BR carried out an extensive programme of modernisation of it between the late 1950s and early 1970s, which included full overhead electrification of the route, and the introduction of modern intercity passenger services at speeds of up to . Further abortive modernisation schemes were proposed, including the introduction of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT) in the 1980s; an ill-fated high speed train which used tilting technology, which was required to allow faster speeds on the curving route, and the abortive InterCity 250 project in the early-1990s. Further modernisation of the route finally occurred during the 2000s in the period of privatisation, which saw speeds raised further to and the introduction of tilting Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; trains. 

As much of the line has a maximum speed of , it meets the European Union&#x27;s definition of an upgraded high-speed line, although only Class 390 Pendolinos with tilting mechanisms operated by Avanti West Coast travel at that speed. Non-tilting trains are limited to .

==Geography==

The spine between London Euston and is long, with principal InterCity stations at , , , , , , , , , , and .

The spine has bypasses serving the major towns and cities of Northampton, Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Spurs serve Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield, Stockport, Manchester, Runcorn and Liverpool. There is also a branch to Edinburgh, at Carstairs in Scotland, although this is not the most direct route between London and Edinburgh. It provides a direct connection between the WCML and the East Coast Main Line.

Originally, the lines between , and were part of the main spine, until the Trent Valley Line was built in 1847. This line formed a direct connection between Rugby and Stafford becoming the a part of the spine. South of Rugby, there is a bypass loop that serves . There is a spur at Weaver Junction north of to . Weaver Junction on this branch is the oldest flyover-type junction in Britain. A spur branches off from Crewe to serve Manchester. There is also a spur between Colwich Junction in the Trent Valley, south of Stafford to Stoke-on-Trent, with another spur north of Stafford, also to Stoke-on-Trent. 

The geography of the route was determined by avoiding large estates and hilly areas, such as the Chilterns (Tring Cutting); the Watford Gap and Northampton uplands, followed by the Trent Valley; the mountains of Cumbria, with a summit at Shap; and Beattock Summit in South Lanarkshire. This legacy means the WCML has limitations as a long-distance main line, with lower maximum speeds than the East Coast Main Line (ECML) route, the other main line between London and Scotland. The principal solution has been the adoption of tilting trains, initially with British Rail&#x27;s APT and latterly the &quot;Pendolino&quot; trains constructed by Alstom and introduced by Virgin Trains in 2003. A &#x27;conventional&#x27; attempt to raise line speeds as part of the InterCity 250 upgrade in the 1990s would have relaxed maximum cant levels on curves and seen some track realignments; this scheme faltered for lack of funding in the economic climate of the time.

The early history of the WCML is complex, as it was not originally conceived as a single trunk route, but was built as a patchwork of separate lines by different companies, mostly during the 1830s and 1840s, but some parts were opened as late as the 1880s. After the completion of the pioneering Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, schemes were mooted to build more inter-city lines. The business practice of the early railway era was for companies to promote individual lines between two destinations, rather than to plan grand networks of lines, as it was considered easier to obtain backing from investors.

The first stretch of what is now the WCML was the Grand Junction Railway connecting the Liverpool and Manchester Railway to Birmingham, via , , and , opening in 1837. The following year the London and Birmingham Railway was completed, connecting to the capital via , and the Watford Gap. The Grand Junction and London and Birmingham railways shared a Birmingham terminus at Curzon Street station, so that it was now possible to travel by train between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool. These lines, together with the Trent Valley Railway (between Rugby and Stafford, avoiding Birmingham) and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway (Crewe–Manchester), amalgamated operations in 1846 to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Three other companies, the North Union Railway (Parkside–Wigan–Preston), the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway and the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, completed a through route to by the end of 1846, these were later absorbed by the LNWR.

North of Carlisle, the Caledonian Railway remained independent, and opened its main line from Carlisle to on 10 September 1847, connecting to Edinburgh in February 1848, and to Glasgow in November 1849. The route to Scotland was marketed by the LNWR as &#x27;The Premier Line&#x27;. Because the cross-border trains ran over the LNWR and Caledonian Railway, through trains consisted of jointly owned &quot;West Coast Joint Stock&quot; to simplify operations. The first direct London to Glasgow trains in the 1850s took 12.5hours to complete the journey.

Another important section, the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR), which opened its route in 1848 from (connecting with the LNWR from Manchester) to Stafford and Colwich Junction via , also remained independent. The NSR provided a useful alternative route to Manchester, however poor relations between the LNWR and the NSR meant that through trains did not run until 1867.

The final sections of what is now the WCML were put in place over the following decades. A direct branch to , bypassing the earlier Liverpool and Manchester line, was opened in 1869, from Weaver Junction north of to Ditton Junction via the Runcorn Railway Bridge over the River Mersey.

At the northern end, the Caledonian replaced its original terminus in Glasgow, with the much larger and better located in 1879.

To expand capacity, the line between London and Rugby was widened to four tracks in the 1870s. As part of this work, a new line, the Northampton Loop, was built, opening in 1881, connecting before rejoining the main line at Rugby.

=== LMS, 1923–1948 ===

The entire route came under the control of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) on 1 January 1923 when the railway companies were grouped, under the Railways Act 1921.

The LMS competed fiercely with the rival LNER&#x27;s East Coast Main Line for London to Scotland traffic (see Race to the North). Attempts were made to minimise end-to-end journey times for a small number of powerful lightweight trains that could be marketed as glamorous premium crack expresses, especially between London and Glasgow, such as the 1937–39 Coronation Scot, hauled by streamlined Princess Coronation Class locomotives, which made the journey in 6hours 30minutes, making it competitive with the rival East Coast Flying Scotsman (British Railways in the 1950s could not match this, but did achieve a London-Glasgow timing of 7hours 15minutes in the 1959–60 timetable by strictly limiting the number of coaches to eight and not stopping between London and Carlisle.)

===British Rail, 1948–1997 ===
In 1948, following nationalisation, the line came under the control of British Railways&#x27; London Midland and Scottish Regions, when the term &quot;West Coast Main Line&quot; came into use officially, although it had been used informally since at least 1912.

==== Modernisation by British Rail ====

As part of the 1955 modernisation plan, British Rail carried out a large programme of modernisation of the WCML in stages between 1959 and 1974; the modernisation involved upgrading the track and signaling to allow higher speeds, rebuilding a number of stations, and electrification of the route with overhead line equipment. The first stretch to be upgraded and electrified was Crewe to Manchester, completed on 12 September 1960. This was followed by Crewe to Liverpool, completed on 1 January 1962. Electrification was then extended south to London. The first electric trains from London ran on 12 November 1965, with a full public service to Manchester and Liverpool launched on 18 April 1966. Electrification of both the Birmingham branch, and the routes to Manchester via was completed on 6 March 1967, allowing electric services to commence to those destinations. In March 1970 the government approved electrification of the northern half of the WCML, between Weaver Junction (where the branch to Liverpool diverges) and Glasgow, and this was completed on 6 May 1974. The announcement, after five years of uncertainty, was made 48hours before the writ was issued for a by-election in South Ayrshire. &quot;The Observer&quot; commented that, if the £25 million decision was politically rather than financially motivated, it would have the makings of a major political scandal.

A new set of high-speed long-distance services was introduced in 1966, launching British Rail&#x27;s highly successful &quot;Inter-City&quot; brand (the hyphen was later dropped) and offering journey times as London to Birmingham in 1 hour 35 minutes, and London to Manchester or Liverpool in 2hours 40minutes (and even 2hours 30minutes for the twice-daily Manchester Pullman). This represented a big improvement on the 3hours 30minutes to Manchester and Liverpool of the fastest steam service. A new feature was that these fast trains were offered on a regular-interval service throughout the day: initially hourly to Birmingham, two-hourly to Manchester, and so on. The service proved to be so popular that in 1972 these InterCity service frequencies were doubled to deal with increased demand. With the completion of the northern electrification in 1974, London to Glasgow journey times were reduced from 6hours to 5. Along with electrification came modern coaches such as the Mark 2 and from 1974 the fully integral, air-conditioned Mark 3 design. These remained the mainstay of express services until the early 2000s. Line speeds were raised to a maximum , and these trains, hauled by and electric locomotives, came to be seen as BR&#x27;s flagship passenger service. Passenger traffic on the WCML doubled between 1962 and 1975.

The modernisation also saw the demolition and redevelopment of several of the key stations on the line: BR was keen to symbolise the coming of the &quot;electric age&quot; by replacing the Victorian-era buildings with new structures built from glass and concrete. Notable examples were , , , and . To enable the latter, the famous Doric Arch portal into the original Philip Hardwick-designed terminus was demolished in 1962 amid much public outcry.

Electrification of the Edinburgh branch was carried out in the late 1980s as part of the East Coast Main Line electrification project in order to allow InterCity 225 sets to access Glasgow via Carstairs Junction.
Modernisation brought great improvements in speed and frequency. However some locations and lines were no longer served by through trains or through coaches from London, such as: ; , and ; , , and (via Stockport); ; (via Stockport); and ; (via ); and . Notable also is the loss of through services between Liverpool and Scotland; however these were restored by TransPennine Express in 2019.

British Rail introduced the Advanced Passenger Train APT project, which proved that London–Glasgow WCML journey times of less than 4hours were achievable and paved the way for the later tilting Virgin &quot;Pendolino&quot; trains. In the late 1980s, British Rail put forward a track realignment scheme to raise speeds on the WCML; a proposed project called InterCity 250, which entailed realigning parts of the line in order to increase curve radii and smooth gradients in order to facilitate higher-speed running. The scheme, which would have seen the introduction of new rolling stock derived from that developed for the East Coast electrification, was scrapped in 1992.

===Privatisation, 1997–present===
As part of the privatisation of British Rail in the 1990s, the infrastructure was taken over in 1994 by the private company Railtrack, which later collapsed in 2002, and was replaced by the not-for-profit company Network Rail. WCML&#x27;s InterCity services became part of the InterCity West Coast franchise, which was won by Virgin Trains who took over in 1997. In 2019, Avanti West Coast won the new West Coast Partnership franchise, taking over from Virgin Trains.

==== Modernisation by Railtrack and Network Rail ====

By the dawn of the 1990s, it was clear that further modernisation was required. Initially this took the form of the InterCity 250 project. The modernisation plan unveiled by Virgin and the new infrastructure owner Railtrack involved the upgrade and renewal of the line to allow the use of tilting &quot;Pendolino&quot; trains with a maximum line speed of , in place of the previous maximum of . Railtrack estimated that this upgrade would cost £2 billion, be ready by 2005, and cut journey times to 1 hour for London to Birmingham and 1 hr 45 mins for London to Manchester.

However, these plans proved too ambitious and were subsequently scaled back. The upgrade was described as &quot;a classic example of disastrous project management&quot;. Central to the implementation of the plan was the adoption of moving block signalling, which had never been proven on anything more than simple metro lines and light rail systems – not on a complex high-speed heavy-rail network such as the WCML. Despite this, Railtrack made what would prove to be the fatal mistake of not properly assessing the technical viability and cost of implementing moving block prior to promising the speed increase to Virgin and the government. By 1999, with little headway on the modernisation project made, it became apparent to engineers that the technology was not mature enough to be used on the line. The bankruptcy of Railtrack in 2001 and its replacement by Network Rail following the Hatfield crash brought a reappraisal of the plans, while the cost of the upgrade soared. Following fears that cost overruns on the project would push the final price tag to £13 billion, the plans were scaled down, bringing the cost down to between £8 billion and £10 billion, to be ready by 2008, with a maximum speed for tilting trains of a more modest – equalling the speeds available on the East Coast route, but some way short of the original target, and even further behind BR&#x27;s original vision of speeds planned and achieved with the APT.

The first phase of the upgrade, south of Manchester, opened on 27 September 2004 with journey times of 1hour 21minutes for London to Birmingham and 2hours 6minutes for London to Manchester. The final phase, introducing running along most of the line, was announced as opening on 12 December 2005, bringing the fastest journey between London and Glasgow to 4hours 25mins (down from 5hours 10minutes). However, considerable work remained, such as the quadrupling of the track in the Trent Valley, upgrading the slow lines, the second phase of remodelling Nuneaton, and the remodelling of Stafford, Rugby, Milton Keynes and Coventry stations, and these were completed in late 2008. The upgrading of the Crewe–Manchester line via Wilmslow was completed in summer 2006.

In September 2006, a new speed record was set on the WCML – a Pendolino train completed the Glasgow Central – London Euston run in a record 3hours 55minutes, beating the APT&#x27;s record of 4hours 15minutes, although the APT still holds the overall record on the northbound run.
The decade-long modernisation project was finally completed in December 2008. This allowed Virgin&#x27;s VHF (very high frequency) timetable to be progressively introduced through early 2009, the highlights of which are a three-trains-per-hour service to both Birmingham and Manchester during off-peak periods, and nearly all London-Scottish timings brought under the 4hours 30minutes barrier – with one service (calling only at Preston) achieving a London–Glasgow time of 4hours 8minutes.

Some projects that were removed from the modernisation as a result of the de-scoping, such as a flyover at Norton Bridge station, were later restarted. A £250million project to grade-separate the tracks at Norton Bridge that allowed for increased service frequency as well as improved line-speeds was completed in spring 2016. Other projects such as the replacement of a weak bridge in Watford allowed line-speeds to be increased from to , decreasing journey times.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Track ===

The main spine of the WCML is quadruple track almost all of the route from London to south of Winsford. At Hanslope Junction (near Milton Keynes), the line divides with one pair going direct to and the other pair diverting via to rejoin at Rugby. The spine continues north in quadruple track until Brinklow, where it reduces to triple track. The line between Brinklow and Nuneaton has three tracks, with one northbound track and fast and slow southbound tracks. The line then reverts to quadruple track at Nuneaton. North of Rugeley, there is a short double track stretch through the Shugborough Tunnel. The line is then quadruple track most of the way to Acton Bridge railway station, except for a double track section between Winsford and Hartford. The line is double track from to Weaver Junction (where a double track spur to Liverpool branches off). The line is double track from Weaver Junction to , but the line is quadruple track between Warrington Bank Quay to . At Newton-le-Willows, the slow lines join the Liverpool to Manchester line to pass through the centre of the town, while the fast lines take the direct route via the Golborne cut-off. There are two more stretches of quadruple track, otherwise the line is double track to Scotland. The first is from Euxton Balshaw Lane to Preston, and the second is between and 

The WCML is noted for the diversity of branches served from the spine, notably those to/from the West Midlands and North Wales, Greater Manchester, and Liverpool. These are detailed in the route diagram.

The complete route has been cleared for W10 loading gauge freight traffic, allowing use of higher hi-cube shipping containers. The route passes through Nuneaton and the Midlands and this area has been called the &quot;Golden Triangle of Logistics&quot;.

=== Electrification ===
Nearly all of the WCML is electrified with overhead line equipment at . Several of the formerly unelectrified branches of the WCML in the North West have recently been electrified such as the to Line on which electric service commenced in May 2018 along with the Preston – line which saw electric service commence in February 2019. Wigan to Liverpool via St Helens Shaw Street and St Helens Junction were also electrified in the 2010-2017 timeframe. 

The to branch is also in the process of being electrified.

== Rolling stock ==

The majority of stock used on the West Coast Main Line is new-build, part of Virgin&#x27;s initial franchise agreement having been a commitment to introduce a brand-new fleet of tilting Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot; trains for long-distance high-speed WCML services. The 53-strong &quot;Pendolino&quot; fleet, plus three tilting SuperVoyager diesel sets, were bought for use on these InterCity services. One Pendolino was written off in 2007 following the Grayrigg derailment. After the 2007 franchise &quot;shake-up&quot; in the Midlands, more SuperVoyagers were transferred to Virgin West Coast, instead of going to the new CrossCountry franchise. The SuperVoyagers are used on London–Chester and Holyhead services because the Chester/North Wales line is not electrified, so they run &quot;under the wires&quot; between London and Crewe. SuperVoyagers were also used on Virgin&#x27;s London-Scotland via Birmingham services, even though this route is entirely electrified – this situation is, however, changing since the expansion of the &quot;Pendolino&quot; fleet; from 2013 onward Class 390 sets have been routinely deployed on Edinburgh/Glasgow–Birmingham services.

By 2012, the WCML &quot;Pendolino&quot; fleet was strengthened by the addition of two coaches to 31 of the 52 existing sets, thus turning them into 11-car trains. Four brand new 11-car sets are also part of this order, one of which replaced the set lost in the Grayrigg derailment. Although the new stock was supplied in Virgin livery, it was not expected to enter traffic before 31 March 2012, when the InterCity West Coast franchise was due to be re-let, though the date for the new franchise was later put back to December 2012, and any effect of this on the timetable for introducing the new coaches remains unclear.

Previous franchisees Central Trains and Silverlink (operating local and regional services partly over sections of the WCML) were given 30 new &quot;Desiro&quot; Class 350s, originally ordered for services in the south-east. Following Govia&#x27;s successful bid for the West Midlands franchise in 2007, another 37 Class 350 units were ordered to replace its older fleet of s.

The older BR-vintage locomotive-hauled passenger rolling stock still has a limited role on the WCML, with the overnight Caledonian Sleeper services between London Euston and Scotland using Mark 3 and Mark 2 coaches until their replacement with Mark 5 stock in October 2019. Virgin also retained and refurbished one of the original Mark 3 rakes with a Driving Van Trailer and a locomotive as a standby set to cover for &quot;Pendolino&quot; breakdowns. This set was retired from service on 25 October with a rail tour the following day. In November 2014, the &quot;Pretendolino&quot; was transferred to Norwich Crown Point depot to enter service with Abellio Greater Anglia having come to the end of its agreed lease to Virgin Trains.

In September 2022, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, locomotive hauled services returned briefly to the WCML once more when incumbent operator Avanti West Coast employed a rake of Mark 3 coaches (hauled by a Class 90 locomotive) to provide additional services to Euston for those wishing to travel to London for the Queen&#x27;s lying-in-state and subsequent funeral.

The following table lists the rolling stock which forms the core passenger service pattern on the WCML serving its principal termini; it is not exhaustive as many other types use small sections of the WCML as part of other routes.

== Operators ==

=== Avanti West Coast ===
The current principal long distance train operating company on the West Coast Main Line is Avanti West Coast, which runs the majority of long-distance services under the West Coast Partnership rail franchise. In November 2016, the government announced that the (then named) InterCity West Coast franchise would be replaced by a new franchise called &#x27;West Coast Partnership&#x27;, which includes operating the planned High Speed 2 (HS2) service as well as the existing West Coast Main Line express services. In August 2019, the DfT announced that First Trenitalia West Coast Rail (trading as Avanti West Coast) was the successful bidder. Avanti West Coast commenced operating the franchise on 8 December 2019.

Avanti operates nine trains per hour on the WCML from , with three trains per hour to , two trains per hour to , one train per hour to each of , and via the Trent Valley (one Birmingham New Street train per hour continues to Scotland via alternating between or {Glasgow Central), five trains on a weekday to and three trains on a weekday to . There is also one weekday train in to/from . Additional peak terminating services run between London Euston and , Wolverhampton, , , and . Additional trains during the early morning, late evening, rush hour and night that terminate or start at Birmingham. There are also three daily (Monday to Friday) services between London Euston and .

=== West Midlands Trains ===
West Midlands Trains is the current principal commuter and outer suburban operator on the route, and provides some long-distance services which terminate at London Euston. They are all operated under the London Northwestern Railway brand. There are two trains an hour from London to Birmingham; one calling at the majority of stations &quot;en route&quot; and one calling only at , , , , , , , , , Birmingham International and . There are two return trains per hour from Birmingham New Street to London Euston. These London–Birmingham stopping services are roughly one hour slower, end to end, than the Avanti West Coast fast service. There is also an hourly service from London Euston to Northampton calling at , , Milton Keynes Central and .

West Midlands Trains also operates an hourly service between London Euston and Crewe, serving Watford Junction, Milton Keynes Central, Rugby, , , , , , and Crewe. Some services also call at , , , , Leighton Buzzard and Bletchley. Trains also call at (Sundays only). This service was introduced in 2008 to coincide with the withdrawal of the similar Virgin Trains service. Under &#x27;Project 110&#x27; this service was reconfigured in December 2012 and to operate 10 mph faster using enhanced British Rail Class 350/1 units.

A service to Tring is provided half-hourly from Euston; one calling at , , Watford Junction, , , Hemel Hempstead and Berkhamsted and one calling at , Harrow &amp; Wealdstone, Bushey, Watford Junction, Kings Langley, Apsley, Hemel Hempstead and Berkhamstead. An hourly service operates to Milton Keynes Central calling at Watford Junction, Hemel Hempstead, {erkhamstead, Tring, Cheddington, Leighton Buzzard and Bletchley.

West Midlands Trains also operates an hourly stopping train on the Marston Vale Line from Bletchley to as well as a 45-minute service on the Abbey Line to . These are both local branches off the WCML and classified as part of it.

After the Central Trains franchise was revised, London Midland took over services running on the WCML between Birmingham and Liverpool. In August 2017, London Midland lost the West Midlands franchise; West Midlands Trains took over in December 2017. Services on the WCML are all branded London Northwestern Railway services, and all local services around Birmingham are branded West Midlands Railway services.

=== TransPennine Express ===
TransPennine Express provides services along the WCML between or Liverpool Lime Street, and Glasgow or Edinburgh (alternating serving each every 2hours). 

=== Southern ===
Southern provides an hourly service between and Watford Junction, which calls at all stations on the West London Line, then , Harrow &amp; Wealdstone and Watford Junction.

=== CrossCountry ===
CrossCountry operates services from , and to Manchester Piccadilly; these trains run along the West Coast Main Line between Coventry and Manchester Piccadilly. Some trains from Manchester Piccadilly to Bristol Temple Meads are extended to and Plymouth, and on summer weekends to and . CrossCountry services between and also use a small portion of the West Coast Main Line between Coventry and Birmingham New Street. CrossCountry also operates occasional services to/from Glasgow Central, which operate to either Penzance, Plymouth, Newcastle upon Tyne, Bristol Temple Meads or Birmingham New Street. On summer weekends trains from Glasgow Central also operate to Paignton, Penzance and Newquay. These services use the West Coast Main Line from Edinburgh to Glasgow Central.

=== ScotRail ===
ScotRail operates services on sections of the West Coast Main Line for example near Glasgow with Argyle Line trains running on the section from to before veering off on the short branch to or continuing to . The North Berwick Line runs from Glasgow Central High Level via to Carstairs and on to , Edinburgh Waverley and {{rws|North Berwick.

At {{rws|Carlisle}} the Glasgow South Western Line runs for several miles before heading west towards {{rws|Dumfries}}, {{rws|Kilmarnock}}, {{rws|Ayr}} and {{rws|Stranraer}}.

=== Caledonian Sleeper ===
Caledonian Sleeper operates services down the length of the West Coast Main Line, providing an overnight services each way between London and Scotland.

== Recent developments ==

=== Felixstowe and Nuneaton freight capacity scheme ===
{{Main|Birmingham to Peterborough Line}}
A number of items of work are under way or proposed to accommodate additional freight traffic between the Haven ports and the Midlands including track dualling. The &#x27;Nuneaton North Chord&#x27; was completed and opened on 15 November 2012. The chord will ease access for some trains between the Birmingham to Peterborough Line and the WCML. The Ipswich chord was opened at the end of March 2014 allowing trains to run without reversing from Felixstowe towards the Midlands.

=== Stafford Area Improvements Programme ===
A planned flying junction and {{convert|2.5|mi|km|abbr=on}} track diversion in the {{rws|Stafford}} – {{rws|Norton Bridge}} area. This replaced the previous level junction where the Stafford to Manchester via Stoke-on-Trent line diverges from the trunk route at Norton Bridge, avoiding conflicting train movements to enhance capacity and reduce journey times. This allowed two extra off-peak trains per hour from Euston to the North West, one extra train per hour from Manchester to Birmingham and one additional freight train per hour. Additional freight capacity was also provided around Stafford station. The resignalling work associated with this project was due to be completed in summer 2015 and the Norton Bridge work was complete in December 2016, followed by a new timetable introduced in December 2017.

=== Weaver Junction to Liverpool signalling ===
Re-signalling work the WCML spur track from Liverpool to Weaver Junction was underway in 2016. Signal control moved to the Manchester Rail Operating Centre removing five local signal boxes. The signalling improvements are intended to improve journey times on this section of line.

== Proposed development ==
=== Increased line speed ===
In 2007, Virgin Trains put forward plans to increase the line speed in places on the WCML – particularly along sections of the Trent Valley Line between Stafford and Rugby from {{cvt|125|to|135|mph}} after the quadrupling of track had been completed. This would permit faster services and possibly allow additional train paths. {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was claimed to be achievable by Pendolino trains while using existing lineside signalling without the need for cab signalling via the use of the TASS system (Tilt Authorisation and Speed Supervision) to prevent overspeeding. In practice, regulations introduced by the HMRI (now ORR) at the time of the ECML high-speed test runs in 1991 are still in force prohibiting this. Network Rail was aware of Virgin Trains&#x27; aspirations; however, in November 2009 Chris Mole MP (then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Transport) announced that there were no plans for this to happen and thus for the foreseeable future the maximum speed will remain at {{convert|125|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. In promoting this proposal, Virgin Trains reported that passenger numbers on Virgin West Coast increased from 13.6 million in 1997/98 to 18.7 million in 2005/6, while numbers on CrossCountry grew from 12.6 million to 20.4 million over the same period.

=== Crossrail extension ===
In the &quot;London &amp; South East Rail Utilisation Strategy&quot; (RUS) document published by Network Rail in 2011, a proposal was put forward to extend the Crossrail lines, currently under construction in central London, along the West Coast Main Line as far as {{rws|Tring}} and {{rws|Milton Keynes Central}}. The scheme would involve the construction of a tunnel in the vicinity of the proposed new station at {{rws|Old Oak Common}} in West London connecting the Crossrail route to the WCML slow lines with a potential for interchange with the planned High Speed 2 line. Under current plans, a proportion of westbound Crossrail trains will terminate at {{rws|Paddington}} due to capacity limitations; the RUS recommends the WCML extension as it will enable these services to continue beyond Paddington, maximising the use of the central London tunnels. The RUS also notes that diversion of WCML regional rail services via Crossrail into central London would alleviate congestion at Euston station, and consequently reduce the need for infrastructure work on the London Underground network which would be required to accommodate HS2 passengers arriving at Euston. The Crossrail extension proposal has not been officially confirmed or funded. In August 2014, the government launched a study into the Crossrail extension.

{{see also|Trent Valley line}}

In June 2019 Network Rail formed five regions for helping to support Britain&#x27;s railways. In August and September 2019, 14 routes responsible for the operation, maintenance and renewal of infrastructure were assigned across these regions. The West Coast Main Line runs through two of these regions (&quot;Scotland&#x27;s Railway&quot; and &quot;North West and Central&quot;) and is a part of 3 routes (&quot;Scotland&quot;, &quot;North West&quot; and &quot;West Coast Mainline South&quot;).

The cities and towns served by the WCML are listed in the tables below. Stations on loops and branches are marked **. Those stations in &quot;italics&quot; are not served by inter-city services run by Avanti West Coast but only by local trains. Between Euston and Watford Junction the WCML is largely but not exactly paralleled by the operationally independent Watford DC Line, a local stopping service now part of London Overground, with 17 intermediate stations, including three with additional platforms on the WCML.

The final table retraces the route specifically to indicate the many loops, branches, junctions and interchange stations on the core of the WCML.

The North Wales Coast Line between Crewe and Holyhead is not electrified. Services between London, Chester and Holyhead are operated by Super Voyager tilting diesel trains. Formerly in the case of one of the Holyhead services, a Pendolino set was hauled from Crewe by a Class 57/3 diesel locomotive.

<text>Spencer Williams (October 14, 1889 – July 14, 1965) was an American jazz and popular music composer, pianist, and singer. He is best known for his hit songs &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot;, &quot;Royal Garden Blues&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Found a New Baby&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves My Baby&quot;, &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot;, and many others.

==Biography==
Spencer Williams was born in Vidalia, Louisiana, United States. He was reportedly educated at St. Charles University in New Orleans, although no such school is known to have existed (there was, however, a St. Charles University a few hours west in Grand Couteau).

Williams was performing in Chicago by 1907, and moved to New York City about 1916. After arriving in New York, he co-wrote with Anton Lada of the Louisiana Five several songs. One of them was &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;, which became one of his most popular songs and is still recorded by musicians to this day.

Williams toured Europe with bands from 1925 to 1928; during this time he wrote for Josephine Baker at the Folies Bergère in Paris. Williams then returned to New York for a few years. At the end of the 1920s, Williams was tried but then acquitted on a charge of murder. In 1932, he moved to Europe, spending many years in London before moving to Stockholm in 1951. Williams was married to Pat Castleton (a stage name of Agnes Bage). They had two daughters together, named Della and Lindy.

His hit songs include &quot;Basin Street Blues&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got Nobody&quot;, &quot;Royal Garden Blues&quot;, &quot;Mahogany Hall Stomp&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Found a New Baby&quot;, &quot;Everybody Loves My Baby&quot;, &quot;Shimmy-Sha-Wobble&quot;, &quot;Boodle Am Shake&quot;, &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot;, &quot;Fireworks&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Give Nobody None of My Jelly Roll&quot;, &quot;Arkansas Blues&quot;, plus the dirty blues standard &quot;Georgia Grind&quot;, &quot;Paradise Blues&quot;, &quot;When Lights Are Low&quot;, and &quot;My Man o&#x27; War&quot;.

Williams returned to New York in 1957, before his death in Flushing, Queens, on July 14, 1965.

Williams was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.

<text>Levi Eshkol ( ;‎ 25 October 1895 – 26 February 1969), born Levi Yitzhak Shkolnik (), was an Israeli statesman who served as the third Prime Minister of Israel from 1963 until his death from a heart attack in 1969. A founder of the Israeli Labor Party, he served in numerous senior roles, including Minister of Defense (1963–1967) and Minister of Finance (1952–1963).

Eshkol was first appointed as prime minister following the resignation of David Ben-Gurion. He then led the party in the elections to the Sixth Knesset (1965) and won, remaining in office for six consecutive years. Shortly after taking office, Eshkol made several significant changes, among them the annulment of military rule over Israeli Arabs and a successful journey to the United States, being the first Israeli leader to be formally invited to the White House. His relations with American President Lyndon B. Johnson greatly affected Israel–United States relations and later on the Six-Day War.

Eshkol was active in the Zionist movement from a young age, immigrating to Ottoman Palestine in 1914 and working in agriculture. He was among the founders of the major institutions of the Yishuv, most importantly the Histadrut and Haganah. Eshkol was treasurer of Hapoel Hatzair political party and treasurer of the Agricultural Center. In 1929, he was elected as chairman of the settlement committee within the Zionist Congress, taking a leading role in enabling conditions for new construction. In 1937, Eshkol founded Mekorot water company and was its director until 1951. Simultaneously, he held positions at the Haganah, at Mapai and as chairman of Tel Aviv Workers&#x27; Council. In 1948–1949, Eshkol was Director General of the Ministry of Defense and from 1948 to 1963, he was chairman of the Settlement Department of the Jewish Agency. Elected to the Second Knesset in 1951, he was soon thereafter appointed to key government roles.

Eshkol led the Israeli government during and after the Six-Day War and was the first Israeli Prime Minister to die in office.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Levi Eshkol (Shkolnik) was born in the shtetl of Oratov, Lipovetsky Uyezd, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire (now &quot;Orativ&quot;, Vinnytsia Oblast, Ukraine). Both his parents were Jewish, although his mother Dvora (born as Dvora Krasnyanskaya) came from a Hasidic background, whereas his father Joseph Shkolnik came from a family of Mitnagdim. Both families were business-oriented and were owners of agricultural businesses including flour mills, industrial plants and forestry associated businesses.

Eshkol received a traditional Jewish education from the age of four and began Talmud studies at the age of seven. In addition to his Heder studies, Eshkol was taught by private tutors in general education. In 1911 he was accepted for studies at the Jewish gymnasium in Vilna (now Vilnius, Lithuania) and left his hometown and his family.

In Vilna, Eshkol joined the students&#x27; association Zeiri Zion (Youth of Zion) and began his connections with the Zionist movement. He was elected to the local executive committee and, in 1913, joined Hapoel Hatzair following his meeting with party leader Joseph Shprinzak.

===Public activity 1914–37===
In 1914, he left for Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire. He first settled in Petah Tikva and worked in the setting of irrigation tunnels at the local orchards. In later years he would be recalled as an excelling worker during this period of time. Eshkol also quickly became publicly active and was elected as a member of the local workers&#x27; union. However he soon thereafter left Petah Tikva, joining a small group that was set to settle the area of Atarot (Kalandia).

At the outbreak of World War I, fearing local hostility, his group settled briefly in Kfar Uria, Rishon LeZion and returning to Petah Tikva. In 1915–17 he was a leading member of the Judea Workers&#x27; Union. In 1918, he volunteered with the Jewish Legion and served in it until the summer of 1920.

In September 1920 Eshkol was among the 25 founders of Kibbutz Degania Bet, making it his permanent residence. However, his public activity had grown and he was often sent on various missions. In 1920, he was among the founders of Histadrut. He was also one of the founders of the Haganah. He was a member of the Haganah&#x27;s first national high command (1920–21). As a delegate of Histadrut, he was an international representative in various gatherings and was tasked with organization of the &quot;Agriculture Workers&#x27; Union&quot;. In 1929 he was a delegate for the first time to the Zionist Congress and was elected to the Zionist Executive, which made him an acting member of the executive in the newly formed Jewish Agency.

Between 1933 and 1934, Eshkol was working in Berlin on behalf of the Zionist Organization and HeHalutz youth movement. During this time he negotiated with the German authorities over what became known as the Haavara Agreement. Upon his return to Palestine in 1934, he was appointed director of Nir company, which provided funds to new agricultural settlements.

===Director of Mekorot===
Eshkol lobbied for a national water company from &quot;circa&quot; 1930, presenting budget plans before the World Zionist Organization in 1933 and 1935. The formation of Mekorot water company was made possible in February 1937 under joint management of the Jewish Agency, Histadrut and the Jewish National Fund. Eshkol served as its director until 1951, overseeing its expansion in 1938 from agricultural territories to residential areas and the construction of the first water lines to the southern Negev area as early as 1941. By 1947, more than 200 kilometers of water lines were active.

===Political and military activity 1940–49===

Eshkol returned to serve in the Haganah high command from 1940 to 1948 and was in charge of the organization&#x27;s treasury. He engaged in arms acquisition for the Haganah prior to and during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

Between 1942 and 1944, Eshkol served as Secretary General of Mapai.

During the Second World War Eshkol advocated for Jewish enrollment to the British military. However, he confirmed with the Yishuv&#x27;s leadership and later joined the ideology asserting differentiation between the global front and the local front, fighting against the British Mandate. In 1945–46 Eshkol was representative of Haganah in the leadership of the Jewish Resistance Movement.

In 1944 he was appointed as the Secretary General of Tel Aviv Workers&#x27; Council, remaining in this position until 1948.

In 1947 Eshkol was appointed as a member of the two major defense forums: The Negev Committee that oversaw the administration of the Negev prior to the declaration of independence of Israel, as well as the general Defense Committee of the Yishuv&#x27;s leadership. Later that year, he was appointed by David Ben-Gurion to head the national recruitment center, which laid foundations to the formation of Israel Defense Forces upon independence of the State of Israel, in May 1948, at which point Eshkol was appointed Director-General of the Ministry of Defense, serving from May 1948 to January 1949.

===Rise to national political career===
During the time of mass immigration to the State of Israel (1949–1950), Eshkol headed the Settlement Department in the Jewish Agency, where he first proposed the idea of settling a good number of these immigrants upon newly founded agricultural farms, in order to solve their housing dilemma. He is noted as saying, &quot;We didn&#x27;t know exactly what to do with these Jews. Then we interjected from the counsels of our heart, and from the experience that we had amassed thus far, and said: A desolate country, a desolate people; these two things must cause one another to blossom. From this, the idea was born to launch an extensive agricultural settlement operation and absorb a large part of the immigrants.&quot; Eshkol was elected to the Knesset in 1951 as a member of Mapai party. He served as Minister of Agriculture until 1952.

In the 1959 legislative election, Eshkol coordinated Mapai&#x27;s national campaign with the local party branches. He was also appointed as chairman of the party&#x27;s committee on social affairs. As internal party tension was growing due to the Lavon Affair, Eshkol was asked to serve as an arbitrator.

In 1961, Ben-Gurion asked to retire as prime minister and recommended Eshkol as his successor. However, Mapai made Ben-Gurion stay. Ben-Gurion continued to lead Mapai in the 1961 legislative election but struggled to form a coalition and relied on Eshkol&#x27;s negotiations with rival parties.

===Minister of Finance===

Following the death of Eliezer Kaplan he was appointed Finance Minister and held that position for the following 12 years. During these years, he helped form the ministry of finance, establishing the Budgets Directorate and other bodies. In 1954 he completed legislation for the establishment of the Bank of Israel.

Eshkol oversaw the implementation of Kaplan&#x27;s 1952 economic plan, as well as realizing the Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany, which was towards its final stages of negotiation and signed in September 1952.

In 1957 he began talks with the European Economic Community towards integration of Israel in its market, ultimately achieved in 1964 with the signing of the first commercial agreement between the two entities.

In 1962 Eshkol introduced a new economic plan.

===Party chairmanship===

During his term as finance minister, Eshkol established himself as a prominent figure in Mapai&#x27;s leadership, and was designated by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion as his successor.

When Ben-Gurion resigned in June 1963, Eshkol was elected party chairman with a broad consensus and was subsequently appointed prime minister. However, his relationship with Ben-Gurion soon turned acrimonious over the latter&#x27;s insistence on investigating the Lavon Affair, an Israeli covert operation in Egypt, which had gone wrong a decade earlier. Ben-Gurion was unsuccessful in challenging Eshkol&#x27;s leadership in the 1965 Mapai leadership election and split from Mapai with a few of his young protégés to form Rafi in June 1965. In the meantime, Mapai merged with Ahdut HaAvoda to form the Alignment with Eshkol as its head. Rafi was defeated by the Alignment in the elections held in November 1965, establishing Eshkol as the country&#x27;s indisputable leader. Yet Ben-Gurion, drawing on his influence as Israel&#x27;s founding father, continued to undermine Eshkol&#x27;s authority throughout his term as prime minister, portraying him as a spineless politician incapable of addressing Israel&#x27;s security predicament.

As party chairman, Eshkol formed the basis for the Alignment in 1964, the formation of the unified Israel Labor Party in 1968 and the joining of forces with Mapam to create the second alignment in 1969.

===Prime minister===

Eshkol formed Israel&#x27;s twelfth government in 1963. His first term in office saw continuous economic growth, epitomized by the opening of the National Water Carrier system in 1964. He and Finance Minister Pinchas Sapir&#x27;s subsequent &quot;soft landing&quot; of the overheated economy by means of recessive policies precipitated a drastic slump in economic activity. Israel&#x27;s centralized planned economy lacked the mechanisms to self-regulate the slowdown, which reached levels higher than expected. Eshkol faced growing domestic unrest as unemployment reached 12% in 1966, yet the recession eventually served in healing fundamental economic deficiencies and helped fuel the ensuing recovery of 1967–1973.

Upon being elected into office, Levi Eshkol fulfilled Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky&#x27;s wish and brought his body and that of his wife to Israel where they were buried in Mount Herzl Cemetery.

====Foreign relations====

During his first months as premier, Eshkol was engaged in a now-declassified diplomatic standoff with the United States that had begun in 1960 under Ben-Gurion.
Eshkol worked to improve Israel&#x27;s foreign relations by establishing diplomatic relations with West Germany in 1965, as well as cultural ties with the Soviet Union, which also allowed some Soviet Jews to immigrate to Israel. He was the first Israeli Prime Minister invited on an official state visit to the United States in May 1964.

With Johnson&#x27;s administration also represented in this case by national security aide Robert W. Komer and others, Eshkol signed what became known as the Eshkol-Comer (&quot;sic&quot;) memorandum of understanding (MOU) about Israeli nuclear capabilities. The 10 March 1965 MOU, which has been variously interpreted since, stated, &#x27;Israel would not be the first country to &quot;introduce&quot; nuclear weapons to the Middle East&#x27;.

====Six-Day War====

The special relationship he developed with Johnson would prove pivotal in securing US political and military support for Israel during the &quot;Waiting period&quot; before the Six-Day War of June 1967.

According to Michael Oren, Eshkol&#x27;s intransigence in the face of military pressure to launch an Israeli attack is considered to have been instrumental in increasing Israel&#x27;s strategic advantage and obtaining international legitimacy, but at the time, he was perceived as hesitant, an image cemented after a stuttered radio speech on 28 May. Egyptian President Nasser&#x27;s ever-increasing provocations created diplomatic support for Israel. Eshkol eventually established a National Unity Government, together with Menachem Begin&#x27;s Herut party, and conceded the Defense portfolio to Moshe Dayan.

===Death and funeral===

In the year following the war, Eshkol&#x27;s health gradually declined, although he remained in power. He suffered a heart attack on 3 February 1969 from which he recovered and gradually returned to his work, maintaining meetings from the Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence. In the early morning of 26 February he suffered a fatal heart attack. At his side were his wife and three physicians, including Moshe Rachmilewitz. He died in office, at the age of 73.

Eshkol was laid to rest on 28 February at Mount Herzl and was the first prime minister interred at the Great Leaders of the Nation Plot. He was the first of either presidents and prime ministers of Israel to be buried at the plot, preceded only by Eliezer Kaplan and Yosef Sprinzak.

Eshkol expressed his wishes to be buried at his Kibbutz, Deganya Bet. However, upon his passing a government meeting was convened in which the ministers expressed their support in his burial in Jerusalem. This decision was not only symbolic in its nature (following the Six-Day War), but also supported by the winter season and difficulty of performing a state funeral at the Jordan Valley as well as the War of Attrition and possible security risk at shelling aimed towards the Deganya Bet region. The government&#x27;s offer was approved later that day by the Eshkol family. A second government meeting that day declared two days of national mourning, until after the state funeral. Flags across the country were brought to half mast.

Eshkol&#x27;s body remained at the Prime Minister&#x27;s residence in a symbolic lie in state, with an honor guard of the Israeli Police. On 27 February at 6:00, he was moved to the Knesset plaza, open to the public passing before the casket. An official state ceremony attended by dignitaries and international delegates was held in the Knesset plaza on 28 February, prior to the funeral procession to Mount Herzl.

==Personal life==
Eshkol married three times and had four daughters:
* From his first marriage to Rivka Maharshak (1892-1950), he had a daughter, Noa (1924–2007). They were divorced in 1927.
* Eshkol married his second wife Elisheva Kaplan in 1930, with whom he had three daughters: Dvora Rafaeli (1930–2001), Tama Shochat and Ofra Nevo. His wife Elisheva died in 1959.
* In 1964 he married Miriam, a librarian at the Library of the Knesset and 35 years his junior, who died in 2016.

His eldest daughter Noa did not wed. From his second marriage Eshkol had eight grandchildren. His daughter Dvora married Eliezer Rafaeli and was the mother of three sons, including Prof. Sheizaf Rafaeli. His daughter Tama married Avraham Shochat, who succeeded him as minister of finance (1992–1996, 1999–2001), and had three children. His youngest daughter Ofra married Prof. Baruch Nevo and had two sons, including author Eshkol Nevo who was named after him.

Eshkol had three siblings. His brother Ben-Zion Shkolnik was a refusenik who made aliyah in 1964. Two other brothers, Lippa and Emanuel, remained in the Soviet Union. Emanuel Shkolnik was killed during combat in the Second World War while serving in the Red Army.

==Public recognition==
===Honors===

Eshkol was given honorary citizenships of towns and cities in Israel and abroad: Philadelphia (1964), Chicago (1964), El Paso (1964), Tirat Carmel (1965), Kiryat Gat (1965), Nazareth Ilit (1965), Beer Sheva (1965), Beit Shean (1965), Afula (1965), Dimona (1967), Ashdod (1968), Jerusalem (1968), Petah Tikva (1968)

He was awarded with honorary doctorates by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1964), Roosevelt University (1964), Yeshiva University (1964), University of Liberia (1966) and Hebrew Union College (1968).

===Commemoration===

Since 1970, Yad Levi Eshkol is the official organization commemorating prime minister Eshkol. It holds educational activities in his memory, maintains his papers and personal archive, supports academic research relating to Eshkol and, since 2016, operates the historical building in Jerusalem that served as the former prime minister&#x27;s residence and now houses a visitors&#x27; center in memory of Eshkol.

Numerous national sites have been named after him:
* Eshkol Regional Council in the north-western Negev.
* Eshkol National Park near Beersheba.
* Eshkol Power Station.
* Eshkol Water Filtration Plant, the central water filtration facility of the National Water Carrier.

Streets and neighborhoods have been named in his honor, among them the Ramat Eshkol neighborhood in Jerusalem. Several schools are also named after him, including HaKfar HaYarok. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem named the Agriculture Faculty in Levi Eshkol&#x27;s name, as well as established a research institute in his name in the Faculty of Social Sciences.

Israel issued in 1970 a postage stamp with a portrait of Eshkol. In 1984 his image was chosen for the five-thousand old Israeli shekel bill, replaced in 1985 by the five new Israeli shekel bill. Since 1990, his image is found on a limited, yet circulated, minting of the five new Israeli shekel coin that replaced the bill.

<text>Anthracite, also known as hard coal and black coal, is a hard, compact variety of coal that has a submetallic lustre. It has the highest carbon content, the fewest impurities, and the highest energy density of all types of coal and is the highest ranking of coals.

The Coal Region of Northeastern Pennsylvania in the United States has the largest known deposits of anthracite coal in the world with an estimated reserve of seven billion short tons. China accounts for the majority of global production; other producers include Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, South Africa, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, and the United States. Total production in 2020 was 615 million tons.

Anthracite is the most metamorphosed type of coal, but still represents low-grade metamorphism, in which the carbon content is between 86% and 97%. The term is applied to those varieties of coal which do not give off tarry or other hydrocarbon vapours when heated below their point of ignition. Anthracite is difficult to ignite, and burns with a short, blue, and smokeless flame.

Anthracite is categorized into several grades. Standard grade is used predominantly in power generation, and high grade (HG) and ultra high grade (UHG), are used predominantly in the metallurgy sector. Anthracite accounts for about 1% of global coal reserves, and is mined in only a few countries around the world.

==Names==

Anthracite derives from the Greek &quot;anthrakítēs&quot; (), literally &quot;coal-like&quot;. Other terms which refer to anthracite are black coal, hard coal, stone coal, dark coal, coffee coal, blind coal (in Scotland), Kilkenny coal (in Ireland), crow coal or craw coal, and black diamond. &quot;Blue Coal&quot; is the term for a once-popular and trademarked brand of anthracite, mined by the Glen Alden Coal Company in Pennsylvania, and sprayed with a blue dye at the mine before shipping to its Northeastern U.S. markets to distinguish it from its competitors. 

Culm has different meanings in British and American English. In British English, culm is the imperfect anthracite, located predominantly north Devon and Cornwall, which was used as a pigment. The term is also used to refer to some carboniferous rock strata found in both Britain and in the Rhenish hill countries, also known as the Culm Measures. In Britain, it may also refer to coal exported from Britain during the 19th century. In American English, &quot;culm&quot; refers to the waste or slack from anthracite mining, mostly dust and small pieces not suitable for use in home furnaces.

== Properties ==

Anthracite is similar in appearance to the mineraloid jet and is sometimes used as a jet imitation.

Anthracite differs from ordinary bituminous coal by its greater hardness (2.75–3 on the Mohs scale), its higher relative density of 1.3–1.4, and luster, which is often semi-metallic with a mildly green reflection. It contains a high percentage of fixed carbon and a low percentage of volatile matter. It is also free from included soft or fibrous notches and does not soil the fingers when rubbed. Anthracitization is the transformation of bituminous coal into anthracite.

The moisture content of fresh-mined anthracite generally is less than 15 percent. The heat content of anthracite ranges from 26 to 33 MJ/kg (22 to 28 million Btu/short ton) on a moist, mineral-matter-free basis. The heat content of anthracite coal consumed in the United States averages 29 MJ/kg (25 million Btu/ton), on the as-received basis, containing both inherent moisture and mineral matter.

Since the 1980s, anthracite refuse or mine waste has been used for coal power generation in a form of recycling. The practice known as reclamation is being applied to culm piles antedating laws requiring mine owners to restore lands to their approximate original condition.

Chemically, anthracite may be considered as a transition stage between ordinary bituminous coal and graphite, produced by the more or less complete elimination of the volatile constituents of the former, and it is found most abundantly in areas that have been subjected to considerable stresses and pressures, such as the flanks of great mountain ranges. Anthracite is associated with strongly deformed sedimentary rocks that were subjected to higher pressures and temperatures (but short of metamorphic conditions) just as bituminous coal is generally associated with less deformed or flat-lying sedimentary rocks. The compressed layers of anthracite that are deep mined in the folded Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains of the Coal Region of East-central Pennsylvania are extensions of the same layers of bituminous coal that are mined on the generally flat lying and undeformed sedimentary rocks further west on the Allegheny Plateau of Kentucky and West Virginia, Eastern Ohio, and Western Pennsylvania.

In the same way the anthracite region of South Wales is confined to the contorted portion west of Swansea and Llanelli, the central and eastern portions producing steam coal, coking coal and domestic house coals.

Anthracite shows some alteration by the development of secondary divisional planes and fissures so that the original stratification lines are not always easily seen. The thermal conductivity is also higher; a lump of anthracite feels perceptibly colder when held in the warm hand than a similar lump of bituminous coal at the same temperature.

Anthracite has a history of use in blast furnaces for iron smelting; however, it lacked the pore space of metallurgical coke, which eventually replaced anthracite.

== History of mining and use ==
In southwest Wales, anthracite has been burned as a domestic fuel since at least medieval times, when it was mined near Saundersfoot. More recently, large-scale mining of anthracite took place across the western part of the South Wales Coalfield until the late 20th century.

In the United States, anthracite coal history began in 1790 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, with the discovery of coal made by the hunter Necho Allen in what is now known as the Coal Region. Legend has it that Allen fell asleep at the base of Broad Mountain and woke to the sight of a large fire because his campfire had ignited an outcrop of anthracite coal.

By the late 1700&#x27;s was known in the United States that anthracite could be burnt, but the techniques required to do so were unknown. Anthracite differs from wood and bituminous coal in that it has a higher ignition temperature and needs a fresh air draft from the bottom to burn. Several claims are made about who &quot;first&quot; burnt anthracite coal in the United States around this time, and all such claims originate from Pennsylvania. The city of Pottsville, Pennsylvania claims that their town was founded around an anthracite-fired iron furnace purchased by John Potts in 1806, which was already built on the Schuylkill River by 1795. Pennsylvanian Charles V. Hagner recalls in his 1869 book that an unnamed employee of Josiah White and Erskine Hazard accidentally burnt anthracite in their rolling mill at the Falls of the Schuylkill River (after much failed experimentation with burning anthracite) at some point between 1812 and 1815. Judge Jesse Fell is claimed to be the first person to burn anthracite for the purposes of residential heating in the USA in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on 11 February 1808. Judge Fell used an open grate in his fireplace to burn anthracite, as an experiment to prove that it was a viable residential heating fuel.

In spring 1808, John and Abijah Smith shipped the first commercially mined load of anthracite down the Susquehanna River from Plymouth, Pennsylvania, marking the birth of commercial anthracite mining in the United States. From that first mine, production rose to an all-time high of over 100 million tons in 1917.

The difficulty of igniting anthracite inhibited its early use, especially in blast furnaces for smelting iron. With the development of the hot blast in 1828, which used waste heat to preheat combustion air, anthracite became a preferred fuel, accounting for 45% of US pig iron production within 15 years. Anthracite iron smelting was later displaced by coke.

From the late 19th century until the 1950s, anthracite was the most popular fuel for heating homes and other buildings in the northern US, until it was supplanted by oil-burning systems, and more recently natural gas systems. Many large public buildings, such as schools, were heated with anthracite-burning furnaces through the 1980s.

During the American Civil War, Confederate blockade runners used anthracite as a smokeless fuel for their boilers to avoid revealing their position to the blockaders.

The invention of the Wootten firebox enabled locomotives to directly burn anthracite efficiently, particularly waste culm. In the early 20th century US, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad started using only the more expensive anthracite coal in its passenger locomotives, dubbed themselves &quot;The Road of Anthracite&quot;, and advertised widely that travelers on their line could make railway journeys without getting their clothing stained with soot. The advertisements featured a white-clad woman named Phoebe Snow and poems containing lines like &quot;My gown stays white / From morn till night / Upon the road of Anthracite&quot;. Similarly, the Great Western Railway in the UK was able to use its access to anthracite (it dominated the anthracite region) to earn a reputation for efficiency and cleanliness unmatched by other UK companies.

Internal combustion motors driven by the so-called &quot;mixed&quot;, &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;semi-water&quot; or &quot;Dowson gas&quot; produced by the gasification of anthracite with air (and a small proportion of steam) were at one time the most economical method of obtaining power, requiring only , or less. Large quantities of anthracite for power purposes were formerly exported from South Wales to France, Switzerland and parts of Germany.

 widespread commercial anthracite mining in Wales has now ceased, although a few large open cast sites remain, along with some relatively small drift mining operations. Commercial anthracite mining is still ongoing in Pennsylvania; the state produced a &quot;total of 4,614,391 tons of [anthracite] coal, predominately from surface coal mines&quot; in 2015.

==Anthracite today==

Anthracite generally costs two to six times as much as regular coal. In June 2008, the wholesale cost of anthracite was US$150/short ton, falling to $107/ton in 2021; it makes up 1% of U.S. coal production.

The principal use of anthracite today is for a domestic fuel in either hand-fired stoves or automatic stoker furnaces. It delivers high energy per its weight and burns cleanly with little soot, making it ideal for this purpose. Its high value makes it prohibitively expensive for power plant use. Other uses include the fine particles used as filter media, and as an ingredient in charcoal briquettes. Anthracite was an authorised fuel in terms of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Clean Air Act 1993, meaning that it could be used within a designated Smoke Control Area such as the central London boroughs.

=== Mining ===
China today mines by far the largest share of global anthracite production, accounting for more than three-quarters of global output. Most Chinese production is of standard-grade anthracite, which is used in power generation. Increased demand in China has made that country into a net importer of the fuel, mostly from Vietnam, another major producer of anthracite for power generation, although increasing domestic consumption in Vietnam means that exports may be scaled back.

Current U.S. anthracite production averages around five million tons per year. Of that, about 1.8 million tons were mined in the state of Pennsylvania. Mining of anthracite coal continues to this day in eastern Pennsylvania, and contributes up to 1% to the gross state product. More than 2,000 people were employed in the mining of anthracite coal in 1995. Most of the mining as of that date involved reclaiming coal from slag heaps (waste piles from past coal mining) at nearby closed mines. Some underground anthracite coal is also being mined.

Countries producing HG and UHG anthracite include Russia and South Africa. HG and UHG anthracite are used as a coke or coal substitute in various metallurgical coal applications (sintering, PCI, direct BF charge, pelletizing). It plays an important role in cost reduction in the steel making process and is also used in production of ferroalloys, silicomanganese, calcium carbide and silicon carbide. South Africa exports lower-quality, higher-ash anthracite to Brazil to be used in steel-making.

== Sizing and grading ==

Anthracite is processed into different sizes by what is commonly referred to as a breaker. The large coal is raised from the mine and passed through breakers with toothed rolls to reduce the lumps to smaller pieces. The smaller pieces are separated into different sizes by a system of graduated sieves, placed in descending order. Sizing is necessary for different types of stoves and furnaces.

Anthracite is classified into three grades, depending on its carbon content. Standard grade is used as a domestic fuel and in industrial power-generation. The rarer higher grades of anthracite are purer – i.e., they have a higher carbon content – and are used in steel-making and other segments of the metallurgical industries. Technical characteristics of the various grades of anthracite are as follows:
Anthracite is divided by size mainly into applications that need lumps (typically larger than 10 mm) – various industrial processes where it replaces metallurgical coke, and domestic fuel – and those that need fines (less than 10 mm), such as sintering and pelletising.

The common American classification by size is as follows:

Lump, steamboat, egg and stove coals, the latter in two or three sizes, all three being above  in (38 mm) size on round-hole screens.

===High grade===
High grade (HG) and ultra high grade (UHG) anthracite are the highest grades of anthracite coal. They are the purest forms of coal, having the highest degree of coalification, the highest carbon count and energy content and the fewest impurities (moisture, ash and volatiles).

High grade and ultra high grade anthracite are harder than standard grade anthracite, and have a higher relative density. An example of a chemical formula for high-grade anthracite would be C240H90O4NS, representing 94% carbon. UHG anthracite typically has a minimum carbon content of 95%.

They also differ in usage from standard grade anthracite (used mainly for power generation), being employed mainly in metallurgy as a cost-efficient substitute for coke in processes such as sintering and pelletising, as well as pulverised coal injection (PCI) and direct injection into blast furnaces. They can also be used in water purification and domestically as a smokeless fuel.

HG and UHG anthracite account for a small percentage of the total anthracite market. The major producing countries are Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, South Africa and the US.

The primary sizes used in the United States for domestic heating are Chestnut, Pea, Buckwheat and Rice, with Chestnut and Rice being the most popular. Chestnut and Pea are used in hand fired furnaces while the smaller Rice and Buckwheat are used in automatic stoker furnaces. Rice is currently the most sought-after size due to the ease of use and popularity of that type of furnace.

In South Wales, a less elaborate classification is adopted, but great care is exercised in hand-picking and cleaning the coal from particles of pyrites in the higher qualities known as best malting coals, which are used for kiln-drying malt.

Anthracite dust can be made into briquettes and is sold in the United Kingdom under trade names such as Phurnacite, Ancit and Taybrite.

===Semianthracite===
On the opposite end from high-grade anthracite coal, semianthracite coal is defined as a coal which is intermediate between anthracite coal and bituminous coal, and particularly a coal which approaches anthracite in nonvolatile character.

== Underground fires ==
Historically, from time to time, underground seams of coal have caught fire, often from careless or unfortunate mining activities. The pocket of ignited coal is fed oxygen by vent paths that have not yet been discovered. These can smolder for years. Commonly, exhaust vents in populated areas are soon sensed and are sealed while vents in uninhabited areas remain undiscovered. Occasionally, vents are discovered via fumes sensed by passers-by, often in forested areas. Attempts to extinguish those remaining have at times been futile, and several such combustion areas exist today. The existence of an underground combustion site can sometimes be identified in the winter where fallen snow is seen to be melted by the warmth conducted from below. Proposals for harnessing this heat as geothermal energy have not been successful.

A vein of anthracite that caught fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania, in 1962 has been burning ever since, turning the once-thriving borough into a ghost town.

== Major reserves ==
Geologically, the largest most concentrated anthracite deposit in the world is found in the Lackawanna Coal Mine in northeastern Pennsylvania, United States in and around Scranton, Pennsylvania. Locally called the Coal Region, the deposit contains of coal-bearing rock which originally held 22.8 billion short tons (20.68 billion tonnes) of anthracite. The geographic region is roughly 100 miles (161 km) in length and 30 miles (48 km) in width. Because of historical mining and development of the lands overlying the coal, it is estimated that 7 billion short tons (6.3 billion tonnes) of minable reserves remain. Other areas of the United States also contain several smaller deposits of anthracite, such as those historically mined in Crested Butte, Colorado.

Among current producers, Russia, China, Poland, and Ukraine have the largest estimated recoverable reserves of anthracite. Other countries with substantial reserves include Vietnam and North Korea.

The Groundhog Anthracite Deposit in British Columbia, Canada, is the world&#x27;s largest previously undeveloped anthracite deposit. It is owned by the Australian publicly-traded company Atrum Coal and has 1.57 billion tonnes of high grade anthracite.

Anthracites of newer Tertiary or Cretaceous age are found in the Crowsnest Pass part of the Rocky Mountains in Canada and at various places in the Andes in Peru.

<doc id="182547" wikidata="Q265647" url="?curid=182547" title="Trowbridge">
<text>Trowbridge ( ) is the county town of Wiltshire, England; situated on the River Biss in the west of the county, close to the border with Somerset. The town lies south-east of Bath, south-west of Swindon and south-east of Bristol. The parish had a population of 37,169 in 2021.

Long a market town, the Kennet and Avon canal to the north of Trowbridge played an instrumental part in the town&#x27;s development, as it allowed coal to be transported from the Somerset Coalfield; this marked the advent of steam-powered manufacturing in woollen cloth mills. The town was the foremost centre of woollen cloth production in south west England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, by which time it held the nickname &quot;The Manchester of the West&quot;.

The parish encompasses the settlements of Longfield, Lower Studley, Upper Studley, Studley Green and Trowle Common.

==History==

===Toponymy===

The origin of the name &quot;Trowbridge&quot; is uncertain; one source claims derivation from &quot;treow-brycg&quot;, meaning &quot;Tree Bridge&quot;, referring to the first bridge over the Biss, while another states the true meaning is the bridge by &quot;Trowle&quot;, the name of a hamlet and a common to the west of the town. On John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the name is spelt &quot;Trubridge&quot;.

===Early history===
In the 10th century, written records and architectural ruins begin marking Trowbridge&#x27;s existence as a village. In the 1086 Domesday Book the village of Straburg, as Trowbridge was then known, was recorded as having 24 households, well endowed with land, particularly arable ploughlands, and rendering 8 pounds sterling to its feudal lord a year. Its feudal lord was an Anglo-Saxon named Brictric, who was the largest landowner in Wiltshire.

===Castle===

The first mention of Trowbridge Castle was in 1139 when it was besieged. It was no longer in military use by the 14th century and by the 16th only ruins remained.
The castle is thought to have been a motte-and-bailey castle, and its influence can still be seen in the town today. Fore Street follows the path of the castle ditch, and town has a Castle Street and the Castle Place Shopping Centre.

It is likely the Castle was built by Humphrey I de Bohun; his family dominated the town for over a hundred years.

The most notable member of the family was Henry de Bohun, born around 1176, who became lord of the manor when he was about 15 years of age. It was he who really began to shape the medieval town. In 1200 he obtained a market charter, arguably the earliest for a town in Wiltshire, and one of the earliest in England. His officials were to lay out burgage plots for traders, artisans, and shopkeepers. The outline of these plots can still be seen today in the footprints of some of the present shops in Fore Street.

Within Trowbridge Castle was a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon church. Henry de Bohun turned this to secular use and instead had a new church built outside the Castle; this was the first St James&#x27;s Church. In the base of the tower of the present day church, below the subsequently added spire, can be seen the Romanesque architecture of the period.

In 1200 Henry de Bohun was created Earl of Hereford by King John. Like other barons, Henry was later threatened by King John and his caput of Trowbridge was taken from him. Henry then joined with the other barons to oppose John&#x27;s arbitrary rule and forced him to seal Magna Carta (the Great Charter) at Runnymede; and was elected as one of the 25 enforcers of the charter. Some years after Runnymede, Henry regained control of Trowbridge.

===Woollen cloth industry===
Trowbridge developed as a centre for woollen cloth production from the 14th century. Thus before the start of the Tudor period, the towns of south-west Wiltshire stood out from the rest of the county with all the signs of increasing wealth and prosperity during the period of trade recovery led by exports begun under Yorkist Edward IV and, still more, during expansion under Henry VII, when England&#x27;s annual woollen exports increased from some 60,000 to some 80,000 cloths of assize.

During the 17th century the production of woollen cloth became increasingly industrialised. However, mechanisation was resisted by workers in traditional trades; there were riots in 1785 and 1792, and again in the era of Luddism (1811–1816) owing to the introduction of the flying shuttle. Thomas Helliker, a shearman&#x27;s apprentice, became one of the martyrs of the Industrial Revolution in 1803 when he was hanged at Fisherton Jail, Salisbury. Nevertheless, at one point in 1820, Trowbridge&#x27;s scale of production was such it was described as the &quot;Manchester of the West&quot;. It had over 20 woollen cloth producing factories, making it comparable to northern industrial towns such as Rochdale.

The woollen cloth industry declined in the late 19th century with the advent of ring-spinning, and this decline continued throughout the 20th century, although Trowbridge&#x27;s West of England cloth maintained a reputation for excellent quality until the end. The last mill, Salter&#x27;s Home Mill, closed in 1982 and is now the home of Boswell&#x27;s Café and Trowbridge Museum and Art Gallery, integrated into the Shires Shopping Centre. There are also working looms on display. Clark&#x27;s Mill is now home to offices; straddling the nearby River Biss is the &quot;Handle House&quot;, formerly used for drying and storage of teazles used to raise the nap of cloth. This is one of very few such buildings still known to exist in the United Kingdom.

===1800s to present===

In its place a bedding industry developed, initially using wool cast off from the mills; the company now known as Airsprung Furniture Group was started in the town in the 1870s. Food production also developed in the town when Abraham Bowyer started his business in 1805 which eventually, as Pork Farms Bowyers, became one of the largest employers in the town until closure in April 2008 when production moved to the Shaftesbury and Nottingham factories.

The town became the county town of Wiltshire in 1889 when Wiltshire County Council was formed and sought a place which representatives from Swindon and Salisbury, among others, could reach and return home from in one day. Trowbridge fulfilled this criterion by virtue of its railway connections and thus was chosen as the county town, further reinforced by the construction of the county hall in 1939.

The brewing company Ushers of Trowbridge opened in 1824, and developed the brewery in the town. This was finally shut in 2000 following several changes of ownership and its equipment was sold to North Korea, where it forms the core of the Taedonggang brewery, just outside Pyongyang.

===21st-century redevelopment===

Since 2002, there have been plans in place to redevelop significant town centre sites. Trowbridge Community Area Future (TCAF) produced a Community Area Plan in 2004, to guide future development.

In the early 1990s the supermarket chain Tesco moved from St Stephen&#x27;s Place to a site adjoining the A361 on County Way, and their former site remained dormant for a decade. The building was demolished but a pile of rubble, nicknamed &#x27;Mount Crushmore&#x27; by local media, remained. Legal &amp; General acquired the land and construction of St Stephen&#x27;s Place Leisure Park began in 2012. A seven-screen Odeon cinema and Nando&#x27;s restaurant opened in October 2013. A Premier Inn and food outlets including Frankie and Benny&#x27;s and Prezzo followed in 2014.

The former Usher&#x27;s brewery site has also undergone redevelopment over a number of years, with Newland Homes building town centre flats incorporating the frontage of the Usher&#x27;s building.

In April 2009, building work started on one of the town&#x27;s biggest brownfield sites, the former Usher&#x27;s bottling plant. This was developed into a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, a public square and housing.

==Architecture==
There is much of architectural interest in Trowbridge, including many of the old buildings associated with the textile industry, and the Newtown conservation area, a protected zone of mostly Victorian houses. The town has six Grade I listed buildings, namely St James&#x27;s Church, Lovemead House on Roundstone Street, and numbers 46, 64, 68 and 70 Fore Street. The latter is referred to more commonly as Parade House.

Trowbridge Town Hall is in Market Street, opposite the entrance to the now-pedestrianised Fore Street. This three-storey building with an Italianate clock-tower was presented to the residents of the town by a local mill-owner, Sir William Roger Brown, in 1889 to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s golden jubilee. The building was the seat of local government until 1974 and subsequently accommodated the magistrates&#x27; courts until 2003. More recently it has been used for exhibitions and community events.

==Governance==
The Town Council is the first tier of local government and is composed of 21 councillors.
County Hall in Bythesea Road, Trowbridge, is the administrative centre for Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority created in April 2009 which replaced both West Wiltshire District Council and the former Wiltshire County Council, also headquartered at County Hall since 1940. Trowbridge civil parish is divided into seven electoral divisions, each electing one member of Wiltshire Council.

Trowbridge is within the South West Wiltshire parliamentary constituency, which has been represented by Andrew Murrison (Conservative) since its formation in 2010.

== Geography ==
The River Biss enters Trowbridge from the southeast, where it flows through Biss Meadows, managed as a country park. In the north of the town it is joined by the Lambrok Stream, then continues north to join the River Avon near Staverton.

Northwest of the town, part of the Avon Green Belt prevents expansion towards Bradford-on-Avon. To the north and northwest, housing areas in Staverton and Hilperton parishes are contiguous with Trowbridge&#x27;s urban area; however, to the south and southeast, the villages of Southwick, North Bradley, Yarnbrook and West Ashton maintain their separate identities.

==Demography==
The first official census of 1801 showed Trowbridge having 5,799 inhabitants, which rose sharply to 9,545 in 1821. The population rose by less than 50% in the 130 years to 1951, compared to a considerably larger increase in the population of the country as a whole. From 1951 to 2011, the population increased by 133%. Coinciding with this increase, a considerable conversion of arable fields and some riverside meadows to residential estates took place.

According to the census in 2011, the ethnic breakdown of the population of Trowbridge parish was: White 94.8%, Mixed/multiple ethnic groups 1.9%, Asian/Asian British 1.5%, Black/African/Caribbean/Black British 1.1%, Other ethnic group 0.8%. The population of the built-up area, which includes Staverton and Hilperton parishes, was 39,409 in 2011 and was estimated to have grown to 43,719 by mid-2020.

In 2018 the Office for National Statistics estimated the population of the larger &quot;community area&quot; at 45,822, making Trowbridge the most populous area in Wiltshire (excluding Swindon), with Chippenham close behind in second place and Salisbury third. At the 2021 Census, the population of the &quot;built-up area&quot; – consisting of Trowbridge, Staverton and Hilperton parishes – was 43,744.

==Transport==
Trowbridge railway station was opened in 1848 on the Westbury–Bradford-on-Avon section of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway. Today this line forms part of both the Wessex Main Line (Bristol–Westbury–Southampton) and the Heart of Wessex Line (Bristol–Westbury–Weymouth), while the original route to Melksham, Chippenham and Swindon is used by the TransWilts service. Other services from Trowbridge join the Great Western Main Line at Bath and Chippenham, or join the Reading to Taunton line at Westbury.

Trowbridge is about from junction 17 of the M4 motorway at Chippenham. The A361 runs through the town, connecting it to Swindon to the north-east and Barnstaple to the south-west, while the north–south A350 primary route to Poole passes close to the town.

The nearest airport is Bristol Airport, which is west.

==Education==
Primary schools in the town include Bellefield Primary School, The Grove Primary School, Holbrook Primary School, Oasis Academy Longmeadow, Paxcroft Primary School, The Mead Community Primary School, Newtown Primary School, Castle Mead School, St John&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Studley Green Primary School and Walwayne Court Primary School. Children may also attend schools in adjacent parishes including North Bradley CE Primary School, Hilperton CE Primary School and Staverton CE Primary School.

Secondary schools in Trowbridge are the Clarendon Academy, the John of Gaunt School and St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic College. All of the secondary schools also operate their own sixth forms. Larkrise School is a special school for children aged 3 to 19.

Wiltshire College has one of its four campuses in Trowbridge offering a range of vocational courses for school-leavers.

== Healthcare ==
Trowbridge Cottage Hospital, now Trowbridge Community Hospital was opened in 1870.

==Shopping and entertainment==
The town centre is compact, and the focus for shops is the ancient Fore Street; the more modern Shires, Shires Gateway and Castle Place shopping centres provide a variety of outlets.

The civic centre, opened in 2011 and next to the town&#x27;s central park, is a conference and entertainment venue and is home to the town&#x27;s information centre as well as Trowbridge Town Council. A nearby leisure development includes an Odeon cinema and several food vendors (Wagamama, Nando&#x27;s etc.).

The former Town Hall, a large Victorian building, is a performance and exhibition venue and is also used by community groups. At Wiltshire College the Arc Theatre is used by students and local groups. There is a concert hall at Wiltshire Music Centre in neighbouring Bradford-on-Avon.

Trowbridge is part of the historic West Country Carnival circuit. There is an annual multi-day folk music festival called Trowbridge Festival, formerly Trowbridge Village Pump Festival; the 2024 edition was held at Southwick, near Trowbridge.

==Notable people==

Methodism was introduced to the town by local evangelist Joanna Turner in the 18th century. Trowbridge was the birthplace of Sir Isaac Pitman in 1813, developer of the Pitman system of shorthand writing, who has several memorial plaques. Matthew Hutton (later archbishop of Canterbury) was the town&#x27;s rector from 1726 to 1730. The poet George Crabbe held the same position from 1814 until his death in 1832.

Mary Mortimer, born in Trowbridge in 1816, became an American educator. Sir William Cook, born in Trowbridge in 1905, was involved with the development of the British nuclear bomb at Aldermaston in the 1950s, becoming the establishment&#x27;s deputy director.

Sir William Roger Brown (1831–1902), a Trowbridge mill-owner, employed more than a thousand people and donated a school, almshouses, and the Trowbridge Town Hall to the town.

David Stratton, the film critic was born in Trowbridge in 1939. He founded the Melksham and District Film Society before emigrating to Australia in 1963, where he ran the Sydney Film Festival for 17 years, as well as presenting the film review shows &quot;The Movie Show&quot; on SBS and &quot;At The Movies&quot; on the ABC.

Nick Blackwell, professional boxer and former British middleweight champion, is from Trowbridge, as are footballer Nathan Dyer (who played for Leicester City in the 2015-16 season when they won the Premier League), disgraced snooker player Stephen Lee, and Daniel Talbot, winner of the relay at the 2017 World Athletics Championships in a time of 37.47sec – the third fastest time in history.

A greyhound racing track was opened around the Frome Road ground used by Trowbridge Town F.C. from 3 July 1976 until July 1979. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. A series of meetings were also held during 1953.

==Town twinning==

Trowbridge is twinned with four towns: Oujda, the area of Morocco where most of the town&#x27;s immigrant population originate, since 2006;
Leer in Germany, since 1989;
Charenton-le-Pont in France since 1996;
and Elbląg in Poland, as part of West Wiltshire district twinning, since 2000.
The town was the first in England to twin with an Arab Muslim country.

<text>Isaac Butt (6 September 1813 – 5 May 1879) was an Irish barrister, editor, politician, Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, economist and the founder and first leader of a number of Irish nationalist parties and organisations. He was a leader in the Irish Metropolitan Conservative Society in 1836, the Home Government Association in 1870, and the Home Rule League in 1873. Colin W. Reid argues that Home Rule was the mechanism Butt proposed to bind Ireland to Great Britain. It would end the ambiguities of the Act of Union of 1800. He portrayed a federalised United Kingdom, which would have weakened Irish exceptionalism within a broader British context. Butt was representative of a constructive national unionism. As an economist, he made significant contributions regarding the potential resource mobilisation and distribution aspects of protection, and analysed deficiencies in the Irish economy such as sparse employment, low productivity, and misallocation of land. He dissented from the established Ricardian theories and favoured some welfare state concepts. As editor he made the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; a leading Irish journal of politics and literature.

==Early life==

Butt was born in 1813 in Glenfin, a district bordering the Finn Valley in County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. Glenfin is a short distance west of Ballybofey, a town in East Donegal. He was born into an Ulster Protestant family, being the son of a Church of Ireland rector, and was descended from the O&#x27;Donnells of Tyrconnell, through the Ramsays. Butt received his secondary school education at The Royal School in Raphoe in the Laggan district of East Donegal, and at Midleton College in County Cork, before going to Trinity College Dublin (TCD), at the age of fifteen, where he was elected a Scholar, and president of the (extern) College Historical Society. Whilst there he co-founded the &quot;Dublin University Magazine&quot; and edited it for four years. For much of his life he was a member of the Irish Conservative Party, and he founded the conservative &quot;Ulster Times&quot; newspaper. He became Whately Professor of Political Economy at Trinity in 1836 and held that position until 1841.

==Legal career==

After being called to the bar in 1838, Butt quickly established a name for himself as a brilliant barrister. He was known for his opposition to the Irish nationalist leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s campaign for the repeal of the Act of Union. He also lectured at Trinity College, Dublin, in political economy. His experiences during the Great Famine led him to move from being an Irish unionist and an Orangeman to supporting a federal political system for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland that would give Ireland a greater degree of self-rule. This led to his involvement in Irish nationalist politics and the foundation of the Home Rule League. Butt was instrumental in fostering links between constitutional and revolutionary nationalism through his representation of members of the Fenians Society in court.

==Political career==

He began his career as a Tory politician on Dublin Corporation. He was Member of Parliament for Youghal from 1852 to 1865, and for Limerick from 1871 to 1879 (at the 1852 general election he had also been elected for the English constituency of Harwich, but chose to sit for Youghal).

The failed Fenian Rising in 1867 strengthened Butt&#x27;s belief that a federal system was the only way to break the dreary cycle of inefficient administration punctuated by incompetent uprisings. Having defended the leaders of the Fenian revolt, Butt then from June 1869 became president of the Amnesty Association formed to secure the release of imprisoned Fenians, supported actively amongst others by P. F. Johnson.

In 1870 Butt then founded the Irish Home Government Association. This was in no sense a revolutionary organisation. It was designed to mobilise public opinion behind the demand for an Irish parliament, with, as he put it, &quot;full control over our domestic affairs&quot;. He believed that Home Rule would promote friendship between Ireland and her neighbour to the east.

In November 1873 Butt replaced the Association with a new body, the Home Rule League, which he regarded as a pressure-group, rather than a political party. In the general election the following year, 60 of its members were elected, forming then in 1874 the Irish Parliamentary Party. However, most of those elected were men of property who were closer to the Liberal cause. In the meantime Charles Stewart Parnell had joined the League, with more radical ideas than most of the incumbent Home Rulers, and was elected to Parliament in a by-election in County Meath in 1875.

Butt had failed to win substantial concessions at Westminster on the things that mattered to most Irish people: an amnesty for the Fenians of 1867, fixity of tenure for tenant-farmers and Home Rule. Although they worked to get Home Rulers elected, many Fenians along with tenant farmers were dissatisfied with Butt&#x27;s gentlemanly approach to have bills enacted, although they did not openly attack him, as his defence of the Fenian prisoners in 1867 still stood in his favour. However, soon a Belfast Home Ruler, Joseph Gillis Biggar (then a senior member of the IRB), began making extensive use of the ungentlemanly tactic of &quot;obstructionism&quot; to prevent bills being passed by the house.

==Declined influence==

When Parnell entered Parliament he took his cue from John O&#x27;Connor Power and Joseph Biggar and allied himself with those Irish members who would support him in his obstructionist campaign. MPs at that time could stand up and talk for as long as they wished on any subject. This caused havoc in Parliament. In one case they talked for 45 hours non-stop, stopping any important bills from being passed. Butt, ageing, and in failing health, could not keep up with this tactic and considered it counter-productive. In July 1877 Butt threatened to resign from the party if obstruction continued, and a gulf developed between himself and Parnell, who was growing steadily in the estimation of both the Fenians and the Home Rulers.

The climax came in December 1878, when Parliament was recalled to discuss the war in Afghanistan. Butt considered this discussion too important to the British Empire to be interrupted by obstructionism and publicly warned the Irish members to refrain from this tactic. He was fiercely denounced by the young Nationalist John Dillon, who continued his attacks with considerable support from other Home Rulers at a meeting of the Home Rule League in February 1879. Although he defended himself with dignity, Butt, and all and sundry, knew that his role in the party was at an end. Barry O&#x27;Brien, in his biography of Parnell, interviews &#x27;X&#x27; who relates: &#x27;It was very painful. I was very fond of Butt. He was himself the kindest-hearted man in the world, and here was I going to do the unkindest thing to him.&#x27;

Butt, who had been suffering from bronchitis, had a stroke the following May and died within a week. He was replaced by William Shaw, who in turn was replaced by Charles Stewart Parnell in 1880.

==Personal life==

Butt amassed debts and pursued romances. It was said that at meetings he was occasionally heckled by women with whom he had fathered children. He was also involved in a financial scandal when it was revealed that he had taken money from several Indian princes to represent their interests in parliament.

He died on 5 May 1879 in Clonskeagh in Dublin. His remains were brought by train, via Strabane, to Stranorlar in the east of County Donegal, where he is buried in a corner of the Church of Ireland cemetery beneath a tree by which he used to sit and dream as a boy.

Despite his chaotic lifestyle and political limitations, Butt was capable of inspiring deep personal loyalty. Some of his friends, such as John Butler Yeats (father of the poet W. B. Yeats) and the future Catholic Bishop of Limerick, Edward Thomas O&#x27;Dwyer, retained a lasting hostility towards Parnell for his role in Butt&#x27;s downfall.

In May 2010 the Church of Ireland (Anglican) parishes of Stranorlar, Meenglass and Kilteevogue instigated an annual memorial Service and Lecture in Butt&#x27;s honour, inviting members of the professions of law, politics and journalism to reflect aspects of his life. Speakers have included Dr. Joe Mulholland, Senator David Norris, Dr. Chris McGimpsey and Prof. Brian Walker. His grave has been restored and the memorial now includes a wreath.

==In literature==

* The novel &quot;Hogan MP&quot; by May Laffan Hartley features a hostile portrait of Butt as &quot;Mr. Rebutter&quot;. The eponymous protagonist, John O&#x27;Rooney Hogan, shares some traits and background of John O&#x27;Connor Power.
*Butt briefly appears in Harry Harrison&#x27;s alternate history novels &quot;Stars and Stripes trilogy&quot;.

<text>Plovdiv (, is the second-largest city in Bulgaria, 93 miles (144 km) southeast of the capital Sofia. It had a population of 371,536 and 675,000 in the greater metropolitan area. Plovdiv is a cultural hub in Bulgaria and was the European Capital of Culture in 1999 and 2019. The city is an important economic, transport, cultural, and educational centre. Plovdiv joined the UNESCO Global Network of Learning Cities in 2016.

Plovdiv is in a fertile region of south-central Bulgaria on the two banks of the Maritsa River. The city has historically developed on seven syenite hills, some of which are high. Because of these hills, Plovdiv is often referred to in Bulgaria as &quot;The City of the Seven Hills&quot;. There is evidence of habitation in the area dating back to the 6th millennium BCE, when the first Neolithic settlements were established. The city was subsequently a Thracian settlement, later being conquered and ruled also by Persians, Ancient Macedonians, Celts, Romans, Byzantines, Goths, Huns, Bulgarians, Thraco-Romans, Bulgars, Slavic tribes, Crusaders, and Ottoman Turks.

Philippopolis (Greek: Φιλιππούπολις) was founded as a &quot;polis&quot; by the father of Alexander the Great, Philip the Great (), the king of ancient Macedonia, settling there both Thracians and 2,000 Macedonians (Greeks) in 342 BCE. Control of the city alternated between the Macedonian kingdom and the Thracian Odrysian kingdom during the Hellenistic period; the Macedonian king Philip V () reoccupied the city in 183 BCE and his successor Perseus () held the city with the Odrysians until the Roman Republic conquered the Macedonian kingdom in 168 BCE. Philippopolis became the capital of the Roman province of Thracia. The city was at the centre of the road network of inland Thrace, and the strategic &quot;Via Militaris&quot; was crossed by several other roads at the site, leading to the Danube, the Aegean Sea, and the Black Sea. The Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius () built a new wall around the city.

In Late Antiquity, Philippopolis was an important stronghold, but was sacked in 250 during the Crisis of the Third Century, after the Siege of Philippopolis by the Goths led by Cniva. After this the settlement contracted, though it remained a major city, with the city walls rebuilt and new Christian basilicas and Roman baths constructed in the 4th century. The city was again sacked by the Huns in 441/442, and the walls were again rebuilt. Roman Philippopolis resisted another attack, by the Avars in the 580s, after the walls were renewed yet again by Justinian the Great ().

In the Middle Ages, Philippopolis fell to the Bulgars of the First Bulgarian Empire in 863, during the reign of Boris I (), having been briefly abandoned by the Christian inhabitants in 813 during a dispute with the &quot;khan&quot; Krum (). During the Byzantine–Bulgarian wars, the emperor Basil the Bulgar-Slayer () used Philippopolis as a major strategic fortification, governed by the &quot;protospatharios&quot; Nikephoros Xiphias. In the middle 11th century, the city was attacked by the Pechenegs, who occupied it briefly around 1090. The city continued to prosper, with the walls restored in the 12th century, during which the historian and politician Niketas Choniates was its governor and the physician Michael Italikos was its metropolitan bishop.

According to the Latin historian of the Fourth Crusade, Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Philippopolis was the third largest city in the Byzantine Empire, after Constantinople (Istanbul) and Thessalonica (Thessaloniki). It suffered damage from the armies passing through the city during the Crusades as well as from sectarian violence between the Eastern Orthodox and the Armenian Orthodox and Paulician denominations. The city was destroyed by Kaloyan of Bulgaria () in 1206 and rebuilt thereafter. In 1219, the city became the capital of the Crusader Duchy of Philippopolis, part of the Latin Empire. The Second Bulgarian Empire recovered the city in 1263, but lost it to Byzantine control before recapturing it in 1323. The Ottoman Empire conquered Philippopolis () in 1363 or 1364. During the 500 years of Ottoman rule, Filibe served as one of the important commercial and transportation nodes in the Ottoman Balkans. It also played a role as an administrative centre of various sanjaks and eyalets.

On 4 January 1878, at the end of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Plovdiv was taken away from Ottoman rule by the Russian army. It remained within the borders of Bulgaria until July of the same year, when it became the capital of the autonomous Ottoman region of Eastern Rumelia. In 1885, Plovdiv and Eastern Rumelia joined Bulgaria.

There are many preserved ruins such as the ancient Plovdiv Roman theatre, a Roman odeon, a Roman aqueduct, the Plovdiv Roman Stadium, the archaeological complex Eirene, and others. Plovdiv is host to a huge variety of cultural events such as the International Fair Plovdiv, the international theatrical festival &quot;A stage on a crossroad&quot;, the TV festival &quot;The golden chest&quot;, and many more novel festivals, such as Night/Plovdiv in September, Kapana Fest, and Opera Open. The oldest American educational institution outside the United States, the American College of Sofia, was founded in Plovdiv in 1860 and later moved to Sofia.

==Etymology==
Plovdiv has been given various names throughout its long history. The Odrysian capital &quot;Odryssa&quot; () is suggested to have been modern Plovdiv by numismatic research or Odrin.
The Greek historian Theopompus mentioned it in the 4th century BCE as a town named &quot;Poneropolis&quot; ( &quot;town of villains&quot;) in pejorative relation to the conquest by king Philip II of Macedon who is said to have settled the town with 2,000 men who were false-accusers, sycophants, lawyers, and other possible disreputables. According to Plutarch, the town was named by this king after he had populated it with a crew of rogues and vagabonds, but this is possibly a folk name that did not actually exist. The names &quot;Dulon polis&quot; ( &quot;slaves&#x27; town&quot;) and possibly &quot;Moichopolis&quot; ( &quot;adulterer&#x27;s town&quot;) likely have similar origins.

The city has been called &quot;Philippopolis&quot; ( ; , in modern Greek, &quot;Philippoupoli&quot; ) or &quot;the city of Philip&quot;, from Greek &quot;Philippos&quot; &quot;horse-lover&quot;, most likely in honor of Philip II of Macedon after his death or in honor of Philip V, as this name was first mentioned in the 2nd century BCE by Polybius in connection with the campaign of Philip V. &quot;Philippopolis&quot; was identified later by Plutarch and Pliny as the former &quot;Poneropolis&quot;. Strabo identified Philip II&#x27;s settlement of most &quot;evil, wicked&quot; (Gr. πονηροτάτους &quot;ponerotatous&quot;) as Calybe (Kabyle), whereas Ptolemy considered the location of Poneropolis different from the rest.

&quot;Kendrisia&quot; () was an old name of the city. Its earliest recorded use is on an artifact mentioning that king Beithys, priest of the Syrian goddess, brought gifts to Kendriso Apollo; the deity is recorded to be named multiple times after different cities. Later Roman coins mentioned the name which is possibly derived from Thracian god Kendriso who is equated with Apollo, the cedar forests, or from the Thracian tribe artifacts known as the kendrisi. Another assumed name is the 1st century CE &quot;Tiberias&quot; in honor of the Roman emperor Tiberius, under whom the Odrysian Kingdom was a client of Rome. After the Romans had taken control of the area, the city was named in , meaning &quot;The Three Hills&quot;, and mentioned in the 1st century by Pliny. At times the name was &quot;Ulpia&quot;, &quot;Flavia&quot;, &quot;Julia&quot; after the Roman families.

Ammianus Marcellinus wrote in the 4th century CE that the then city had been the old &quot;Eumolpias&quot;/&quot;Eumolpiada,&quot; (), the oldest name chronologically. It was named after the mythical Thracian king Eumolpos, son of Poseidon or Jupiter, who may have founded the city around 1200 BCE or 1350 BCE. It is also possible that it was named after the Vestal Virgins in the temples – evmolpeya.

In the 6th century CE, Jordanes wrote that the former name of the city was &quot;Pulpudeva&quot; () and that Philip the Arab named the city after himself. This name is most likely a Thracian oral translation of the other as it kept all consonants of the name Philip + deva (city). Although the two names sound similar, they may not share the same origin as Odrin and Adrianople do, and &quot;Pulpudeva&quot; may have predated the other names meaning &quot;lake city&quot; in Thracian. Since the 9th century CE the Slavic name began to appear as &quot;Papaldiv/n, Plo(v)div, Pladiv, Pladin, Plapdiv, Plovdin,&quot; which originate from &quot;Pulpudeva&quot;. As a result, the name has lost any meaning. In British English the Bulgarian variant &quot;Plòvdiv&quot; has become prevalent after World War I. The Crusaders mentioned the city as &quot;Prineople&quot;, &quot;Sinople&quot; and &quot;Phinepople&quot;. The Ottomans called the city &quot;Filibe&quot;, a corruption of &quot;Philip&quot;, in a document from 1448.

==History==

===Antiquity===

The history of the region spans more than eight millennia. Numerous nations have left their traces on the cultural layers of the city. The earliest signs of habitation in the territory of Plovdiv date as far back as the 6th millennium BCE. Plovdiv has settlement traces including necropolises dating from the Neolithic era (roughly 6000–5000 BCE) like the mounds Yasa Tepe 1 in the Philipovo district and Yasa Tepe 2 in Lauta park. 

Archaeologists have discovered fine pottery and objects of everyday life on Nebet Tepe from as early as the Chalcolithic era, showing that at the end of the 4th millennium BCE, there was already an established settlement there which was continuously inhabited since then. Thracian necropolises dating back to the 2nd–3rd millennium BCE have been discovered, while the Thracian town was established between the 2nd and the 1st millennium BCE.

The town was a fort of the independent local Thracian tribe Bessi. In 516 BCE during the rule of Darius the Great, Thrace was included in the Persian empire. In 492 BCE, the Persian general Mardonius subjugated Thrace again, and it nominally became a vassal of Persia until 479 BCE and the early rule of Xerxes I. The town became part of the Odrysian kingdom (460 BCE – 46 CE), a Thracian tribal union. The town was conquered by Philip II of Macedon, and the Odrysian king was deposed in 342 BCE. Ten years after the Macedonian invasion, the Thracian kings started to exercise power again after the Odrysian Seuthes III had re-established their kingdom under Macedonian suzerainty as a result of a successful revolt against Alexander the Great&#x27;s rule resulting in a stalemate. The Odrysian kingdom gradually overcame the Macedonian suzerainty, while the city was destroyed by the Celts as part of the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe, most likely in the 270s BCE. In 183 BCE, Philip V of Macedon conquered the city, but shortly after, the Thracians re-conquered it.

In 72 BCE, the city was seized by the Roman general Marcus Lucullus but was soon restored to Thracian control. In 46 CE, the city was finally incorporated into the Roman Empire by emperor Claudius; it served as the capital of the province of Thrace. Although it was not the capital of the Province of Thrace, the city was the largest and most important centre in the province. As such, the city was the seat of the Union of Thracians. In those times, the Via Militaris (or Via Diagonalis), the most important military road in the Balkans, passed through the city. The Roman times were a period of growth and cultural excellence. The ancient ruins tell a story of a vibrant, growing city with numerous public buildings, shrines, baths, theatres, a stadium, and the only developed ancient water supply system in Bulgaria. The city had an advanced water system and sewerage. In 179 a second wall was built to encompass Trimontium which had already extended out of the Three hills into the valley. Many of those are still preserved and can be seen by tourists. Today only a small part of the ancient city has been excavated.

In 250 the city was captured and looted after the Battle of Philippopolis by the Goths, led by their ruler Cniva. Many of its citizens, 100,000 according to Ammianus Marcellinus, died or were taken captive. It took a century and hard work to recover the city. However, it was destroyed again by Attila&#x27;s Huns in 441–442 and by the Goths of Teodoric Strabo in 471.

An ancient Roman inscription written in Ancient Greek dated to 253 – 255 AD were discovered in the Great Basilica. The inscription refers to the Dionysian Mysteries and also mentions Roman Emperors Valerian and Gallienus. It has been found on a large stele which was used as construction material during the building of the Great Basilica.

In August 2024, archaeologists from the Regional Archaeological Museum announced the discovery of a well-preserved Thracian temple dated to the third century BCE. The 10-metre-long temple is made of dry joints and clay-sand mortar and has two rooms.

===Middle Ages===

The Slavs had fully settled in the area by the middle of the 6th century. This was done peacefully as there are no records for their attacks. With the establishment of Bulgaria in 681, Philippoupolis, the name of the city then, became an important border fortress of the Byzantine Empire. It was captured by Khan Krum in 812, but the region was fully incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire in 834 during the reign of Khan Malamir. It was reconquered by the Byzantine Empire in 855–856 for a short time until it was returned to Boris I of Bulgaria. From Philippopolis, the influence of dualistic doctrines spread to Bulgaria forming the basis of the Bogomil heresy. The city remained in Bulgarian hands until 970. However, the city is described at the time of Constantine VII in the 10th century as being within the Byzantine province (theme of Macedonia). Philippopolis was captured by the Byzantines in 969, shortly before it was sacked by the ruler of Rus&#x27; Sviatoslav I of Kiev who impaled 20,000 citizens. Before and after the Rus&#x27; massacre, the city was settled by Paulician heretics transported from Syria and Armenia to serve as military settlers on the European frontier with Bulgaria. Aime de Varennes in 1180 encountered the singing of Byzantine songs in the city that recounted the deeds of Alexander the Great and his predecessors over 1300 years before.

Byzantine rule was interrupted by the Third Crusade (1189–1192) when the army of the Holy Roman emperor Frederick Barbarossa conquered Philippopolis. Ivanko was appointed as the governor of the Byzantine Theme of Philippopolis in 1196, but between 1198 and 1200 separated it from Byzantium in a union with Bulgaria. The Latin Empire conquered Philippopolis in 1204, and there were two short interregnum periods as the city was twice occupied by Kaloyan of Bulgaria before his death in 1207. In 1208, Kaloyan&#x27;s successor Boril was defeated by the Latins in the Battle of Philippopolis. Under Latin rule, Philippopolis was the capital of the Duchy of Philippopolis, which was governed by Renier de Trit and later on by Gerard de Strem. The city was possibly at times a vassal of Bulgaria or Venice. Ivan Asen II conquered the duchy finally in 1230 but the city had possibly been conquered earlier. Afterwards, Philippopolis was conquered by Byzantium. According to some information, by 1300 Philippopolis was a possession of Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria. It was conquered from Byzantium by George Terter II of Bulgaria in 1322. Andronikos III Palaiologos unsuccessfully besieged the city, but a treaty restored Byzantine rule once again in 1323. In 1344 the city and eight other cities were surrendered to Bulgaria by the regency for John V Palaiologos as the price for Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria&#x27;s support in the Byzantine civil war of 1341–47.

===Ottoman rule===
In 1364 the Ottoman Turks under Lala Shahin Pasha seized Plovdiv. According to other data, Plovdiv was not an Ottoman possession until the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, after which, the citizens and the Bulgarian army fled leaving the city without resistance. Refugees settled in Stanimaka. During the Ottoman Interregnum in 1410, Musa Çelebi conquered the city killing and displacing inhabitants. The city was the centre of the Rumelia Eyalet from 1364 until 1443, when it was replaced by Sofia as the capital of Rumelia. Plovdiv served as a sanjak centre within Rumelia between 1443 and 1593, the sanjak centre in Silistra Eyalet between 1593 and 1826, the sanjak centre in Eyalet of Adrianople between 1826 and 1867, and the sanjak centre of Edirne Vilayet between 1867 and 1878. During that period, Plovdiv was one of the major economic centers in the Balkans, along with Istanbul (Constantinople), Edirne, Thessaloniki, and Sofia. The richer citizens constructed beautiful houses, many of which can still be seen in the architectural reserve of Old Plovdiv. From the early 15th century till the end of 17th century the city was predominantly inhabited by Muslims.

====National revival====
Under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, Filibe (as the city was known at that time) was a focal point for the Bulgarian national movement and survived as one of the major cultural centers for Bulgarian culture and tradition.

Filibe was described as consisting of Turks, Bulgarians, Hellenized Bulgarians, Armenians, Jews, Vlachs, Arvanites, Greeks, and Roma people. In the 16–17 century a significant number of Sephardic Jews settled along with a smaller Armenian community from Galicia. The Paulicians adopted Catholicism or lost their identity. The abolition of Slavonic as the language of the Bulgarian Church as well as the complete abolition of the church in 1767 and the introduction of the Millet System led to ethnic division among people of different religions. Christian and Muslim Bulgarians were subjected to Hellenization and Turkification respectively. A major part of the inhabitants was fully or partly Hellenized due to the Greek patriarchate. The &quot;Langeris&quot; are described as Greeks from the area of the nearby Stenimachos. The process of Hellenization flourished until the 1830s but declined with the Tanzimat as the idea of the Hellenic nation of Christians grew and was associated with ethnic Greeks.

The re-establishment of the Bulgarian Church in 1870 was a sign of ethnic and national consciousness. Thus, although there is a little doubt about the Bulgarian origin of the Gulidas, the city could be considered of Greek or Bulgarian majority in the 19th century. Raymond Detrez has suggested that when the Gudilas and Langeris claimed to be Greek it was more in the sense of &quot;Romei than Ellines, in a cultural rather than an ethnic sense&quot;. According to the statistics by the Bulgarian and Greek authors, there were no Turks in the city; according to an alternative estimate the city was of Turkish majority.

Filibe had an important role in the struggle for Church independence which was, according to some historians, a peaceful bourgeois revolution. Filibe became the center of that struggle with leaders such as Nayden Gerov, Dr Valkovich, Joakim Gruev, and whole families. In 1836 the first Bulgarian school was inaugurated, and in 1850, modern secular education began when the &quot;St Cyrill and Methodius&quot; school was opened. On 11 May 1858, the day of Saints Cyril and Methodius was celebrated for the first time; this later became a National holiday which is still celebrated today (but on 24 May due to Bulgaria&#x27;s 1916 transition from the Old Style (Julian) to the New Style (Gregorian) calendar). In 1858 in the Church of Virgin Mary, the Christmas liturgy was served for the first time in the Bulgarian language since the beginning of the Ottoman occupation. Until 1906 there were Bulgarian and Greek bishops in the city. In 1868 the school expanded into the first grammar school. Some of the intellectuals, politicians, and spiritual leaders of the nation graduated that school.

The city was conquered by the Russians under Aleksandr Burago for several hours during the Battle of Philippopolis on 17 January 1878. It was the capital of the Provisional Russian Administration in Bulgaria between May and October. According to the Russian census of the same year, Filibe had a population of 24,000 citizens, of which ethnic Bulgarians comprised 45.4%, Turks 23.1% and Greeks 19.9%.

===Eastern Rumelia===

According to the Treaty of San Stefano on 3 March 1878, the Principality of Bulgaria included the lands with predominantly Bulgarian population. Plovdiv which was the biggest and most vibrant Bulgarian city was selected as a capital of the restored country and for a seat of the Temporary Russian Government. Great Britain and Austria-Hungary, however, did not approve that treaty and the final result of the war was concluded in the Congress of Berlin which divided the newly liberated country into several parts. It separated the autonomous region of Eastern Rumelia from Bulgaria, and Plovdiv became its capital. The Ottoman Empire created a constitution and appointed a governor.

In the spring of 1885, Zahari Stoyanov formed the Secret Bulgarian Central Revolutionary Committee in the city which actively conducted propaganda for the unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia. On 5 September, several hundred armed rebels from Golyamo Konare (now Saedinenie) marched to Plovdiv. In the night of 5–6 September, these men, led by Danail Nikolaev, took control of the city and removed from office the General-Governor Gavril Krastevich. A provisional government was formed led by Georgi Stranski, and universal mobilization was announced. After the Serbs were defeated in the Serbo-Bulgarian War, Bulgaria and Turkey reached an agreement that the Principality of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia had a common government, Parliament, administration, and army. Today, 6 September is celebrated as the Unification Day and the Day of Plovdiv.

===Recent history===
After the unification, Plovdiv remained the second most populous city in Bulgaria after the capital Sofia. The first railway in the city was built in 1874 connecting it with the Ottoman capital, and in 1888, it was linked with Sofia. In 1892 Plovdiv became the host of the First Bulgarian Fair with international participation which was succeeded by the International Fair Plovdiv. After the liberation, the first brewery was inaugurated in the city.

The noteworthy English travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor visited Plovdiv in the late summer of 1934 and he was charmed by the town and a local woman name Nadjeda.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Plovdiv grew as a significant industrial and commercial center with well-developed light and food industry. In 1927 the electrification of Plovdiv has started. German, French, and Belgian capital was invested in the city in the development of modern trade, banking, and industry. In 1939, there were 16,000 craftsmen and 17,000 workers in manufacturing factories, mainly for food and tobacco processing. During the Second World War, the tobacco industry expanded as well as the export of fruit and vegetables. In 1943, 1,500 Jews were saved from deportation in concentration camps by the archbishop of Plovdiv, Cyril, who later became the Bulgarian Patriarch. In 1944, the city was bombed by the British-American coalition.

Tobacco Depot workers went on strike on 4 May 1953.

On 6 April 1956, the first trolleybus line was opened and in the 1950s the Trimontsium Hotel was constructed. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was a construction boom and many of the modern neighborhoods took shape. In the 1970s and 1980s, antique remains were excavated and the Old Town was fully restored. In 1990 the sports complex &quot;Plovdiv&quot; was finished. It included the largest stadium and rowing canal in the country. In that period, Plovdiv became the birthplace of Bulgaria&#x27;s movement for democratic reform, which by 1989 had garnered enough support to enter government.

Plovdiv has hosted specialized exhibitions of the World&#x27;s Fair in 1981, 1985, and 1991.


==Geography==

Plovdiv is located on the banks of the Maritsa river, southeast of the Bulgarian capital Sofia. The city is in the southern part of the &quot;Plain of Plovdiv&quot;, an alluvial plain that forms the western portion of the Upper Thracian Plain. From there, the peaks of the Sredna Gora mountain range rise to the northwest, the Chirpan Heights to the east, and the Rhodope mountains to the south. Originally, Plovdiv&#x27;s development occurred south of Maritsa, with expansion across the river taking place only within the last 100 years. Modern Plovdiv covers an area of , less than 0.1% of Bulgaria&#x27;s total area. It is the most densely populated city in Bulgaria, with 3,769 inhabitants per km2.

Inside the city proper are six syenite hills. At the beginning of the 20th century, there were seven syenite hills, but one (Markovo tepe) was destroyed. Three of them are called the Three Hills ( &quot;Trihalmie&quot;), the others are called the Hill of the Youth (, &quot;Mladezhki halm&quot;), the Hill of the Liberators (, &quot;Halm na osvoboditelite&quot;), and the Hill of Danov (, &quot;Danov halm&quot;).

===Climate===
Plovdiv has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with considerable humid continental influences. There are four distinct seasons with large temperature jumps between seasons.

Summer (mid-May to late September) is hot, moderately dry and sunny, with July and August having an average high of . Plovdiv sometimes experiences very hot days which are typical in the interior of the country. Summer nights are mild.

Autumn starts in late September; days are long and relatively warm in early autumn. The nights become chilly by September. The first frost usually occurs by November.

Winter is normally cold and snow is common. The average number of days with snow coverage in Plovdiv is 15. The average depth of snow coverage is , and the maximum is normally , but some winters coverage can reach or more. The average January temperature is .

Spring begins in March and is cooler than autumn. The frost season ends in March. The days are mild and relatively warm in mid-spring.

The average relative humidity is 73% and is highest in December at 86% and the lowest in August at 62%. The total precipitation is and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The wettest months of the year are May and June, with an average precipitation of , and the driest month is August, with an average precipitation of .

Gentle winds (0 to 5 m/s) are predominant in the city with wind speeds of up to 1 m/s, representing 95% of all winds during the year. Mists are common in the cooler months, especially along the banks of the Maritsa. On average there are 33 days with mist during the year.


==Population==
The population by permanent address for the municipality of Plovdiv in 2007 was 380,682, which makes it the second most populated in the nation. According to data from the National Institute of Statistics (NSI), the population of people who actually live in Plovdiv is 346,790.
According to the 2012 census, 339,077 live within the city limits and 403,153 in the municipal triangle of Plovdiv, including Maritsa municipality and Rodopi municipality.
Population of Plovdiv:
At the first census after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1880 with 24,053 citizens, Plovdiv was the third largest city behind Stara Zagora, which had 25,460 citizens prior to being burnt to the ground as well as Ruse, which had 26,163 citizens then, and ahead of the capital Sofia, which had 20,501 citizens then. As of the 1887 census, Plovdiv was the largest city in the country for several years with 33,032 inhabitants compared to 30,428 for Sofia. According to the 1946 census, Plovdiv was the second largest city with 126,563 inhabitants compared to 487,000 for the capital.

===Ethnicity and religion===

In its ethnic character Plovdiv is the second or the third-largest cosmopolitan city inhabited by Bulgarians, after Sofia and possibly Varna. According to the 2001 census, out of a population of 338,224 inhabitants, the Bulgarians numbered 302,858 (90%). Stolipinovo in Plovdiv is the largest Roma neighbourhood in the Balkans, having a population of around 20,000 alone; further Roma ghettos are Hadji Hassan Mahala and Sheker Mahala. Therefore, the census number is a deflation of the number of Roma people, and they are most likely the second-largest group after the Bulgarians, most of all because the Muslim Roma in Plovdiv claim to be of Turkish ethnicity and Turkish-speaking at the census (&quot;Xoraxane Roma&quot;). For further information see the article Roma people in Plovdiv. Like elsewhere in the country, Roma people are subjected to discrimination and segregation (See the Bulgaria section of the article Antiziganism).

After the Wars for National Union (Balkan Wars and World War I), the city became home for thousands of refugees from the former Bulgarian lands in Macedonia, Western and Eastern Thrace. Many of the old neighbourhoods are still referred to as &quot;Belomorski&quot;, &quot;Vardarski&quot;. Most of the Jews left the city after the foundation of Israel in 1948, as well as most of the Turks and Greeks. Prior to the population exchange, as of 1 January 1885, the city of Plovdiv had a population of 33,442, of which 16,752 were Bulgarians (50%), 7,144 Turks (21%), 5,497 Greeks (16%), 2,168 Jews (6%), 1,061 Armenians (3%), 151 Italians, 112 Germans, 112 Romani people, 80 French people, 61 Russians and 304 people of other nationalities.

The vast majority of the inhabitants are Christians, mostly Eastern Orthodox, Catholics, Eastern Catholics, and Protestant trends (Adventists, Baptists and others). There are also some Muslims and Jews. In Plovdiv, there are many churches, two mosques and one synagogue (see Plovdiv Synagogue).

Some Aromanians also inhabit Plovdiv.

==City government==
Plovdiv is the administrative center of Plovdiv Province which consists of the Municipality of Plovdiv, the Maritsa municipality, and the Rodopi municipality. The mayor of the Municipality of Plovdiv, Kostadin Dimitrov, with the six district mayors represent the local executive authorities. The Municipal Council which consists of 51 municipal counsellors, represents the legislative power, and is elected according to the proportional system by parties&#x27; lists. The executive government of the Municipality of Plovdiv consists of a mayor who is elected by majority representation, five deputy mayors, and one administrative secretary. All the deputy mayors and the secretary control their administrative structured units.

According to the &quot;Law for the territorial subdivision of the Capital municipality and the large cities,&quot; the territory of Plovdiv Municipality is subdivided into six district administrations with their mayors being appointed following approval by the Municipal Council.

==Districts and neighbourhoods==

In 1969 the villages of Proslav and Komatevo were incorporated into the city. In 1987 the municipalities of Maritsa and Rodopi were separated from Plovdiv which remained their administrative center. In the last several years, the inhabitants from those villages had taken steps to rejoin the &quot;urban&quot; municipality.

==Main sights==
The city has more than 200 archaeological sites, 30 of which are of national importance. There are many remains from antiquity. Plovdiv is among the few cities with two ancient theatres; remains of the medieval walls and towers; Ottoman baths and mosques; a well-preserved old quarter from the National Revival period with beautiful houses; churches; and narrow paved streets. There are numerous museums, art, galleries and cultural institutions. Plovdiv is host to musical, theatrical, and film events. The Knyaz Alexander I Street is the main street in Plovdiv.

The city is a starting point for trips to places in the region, such as the Bachkovo Monastery at to the south, the ski-resort Pamporovo at to the south or the spa resorts to the north Hisarya, Banya, Krasnovo, and Strelcha.

===Roman City===
The Ancient theatre (Antichen teatur) is probably the best-known monument from antiquity in Bulgaria. During recent archaeological survey, an inscription was found on a postament of a statue at the theatre. It revealed that the site was constructed at the 90s of the 1st century CE. The inscription itself refers to Titus Flavius Cotis, the ruler of the ancient city during the reign of Emperor Domitian.

The Ancient theatre is situated in the natural saddle between two of the Three Hills. It is divided into two parts with 14 rows each divided with a horizontal lane. The theatre could accommodate up to 7,000 people. The three-story scene is on the southern part and is decorated with friezes, cornices, and statues. The theatre was studied, conserved, and restored between 1968 and 1984. Many events are still held on the scene including the Opera Festival Opera Open, the Rock Festival Sounds of the Ages, and the International Folklore festival. The Roman Odeon was restored in 2004. It was built in the 2nd–5th centuries and is the second (and smaller) antique theatre of Philipopolis with 350 seats. It was initially built as a bulevterion, an edifice of the city council, and was later reconstructed as a theatre.

The Ancient Stadium is another important monument of the ancient city. It was built in the 2nd century during the reign of the Roman Emperor Hadrian. It is situated between Danov Hill and one of the Three Hills, beneath the main street from Dzhumaya Square to Kamenitsa Square. It was modelled after the stadium in Delphi. It was approximately long and wide, and could seat up to 30,000 spectators. The athletic games at the stadium were organised by the General Assembly of the province of Thrace. In their honour, the royal mint of Philippopolis coined money featuring the face of the ruling emperor as well as the types of athletic events held in the stadium. Only a small part of the northern section with 14 seat rows can be seen today; the larger part lies under the main street and a number of buildings.

The Roman forum dates from the reign of Vespasian in the 1st century and was finished in the 2nd century. It is near the modern post office next to the Odeon. It has an area of 11 hectares and was surrounded by shops and public buildings. The forum was a focal point of the streets of the ancient city.

The Eirene Residence is in the southern part of the Three Hills on the northern part of an ancient street in the Archeological underpass. It includes remains of a public building from the 3rd–4th centuries which belonged to a noble citizen. Eirene is the Christian name for Penelopa, a maiden from Megadon, who was converted to Christianity in the 2nd century. There are colourful mosaics which have geometrical forms and figures.

On Nebet hill are the remains of the first settlement which in 12th century BCE grew to the Thracian city of Eumolpias, one of the first cities in Southeastern Europe. Massive walls surrounding a temple and a palace have been excavated. The oldest part of the fortress was constructed from large syenite blocks, the so-called &quot;cyclopean construction&quot;.
===Museums and protected sites===
The Archaeological Museum was established in 1882 as the People&#x27;s Museum of Eastern Rumelia. In 1928 the museum was moved to a 19th-century edifice on Saedinenie Square built by Plovdiv architect Josef Schnitter. The museum contains a rich collection of Thracian art. The three sections &quot;Prehistory&quot;, &quot;Antiquity&quot;, and &quot;Middle Ages&quot; contain precious artifacts from the Paleolithic to the early Ottoman period (15th–16th centuries). The famous Panagyurishte treasure is part of the museum&#x27;s collection.

The Plovdiv Regional Historical Museum was founded in 1951 as a scientific and cultural institute for collecting, saving, and researching historical evidence about Plovdiv and the surrounding region from 16th to 20th centuries. The exhibition is situated in three buildings.

The Plovdiv Regional Ethnographic Museum was inaugurated in 1917. On 14 October 1943, it was moved to a house in the Old Town. In 1949 the Municipal House-museum was reorganized as a People&#x27;s Ethnographic Museum and in 1962 it was renovated. There are more than 40,000 objects.

The Museum of Natural Science was inaugurated in 1955 in the old edifice of the Plovdiv Municipality built in 1880. It is among the most important museums in the country with rich collections in its Paleontology, Mineralogy, and Botanic sections. There are several rooms for wildlife and it contains Bulgaria&#x27;s largest freshwater aquarium with 40 fish species. It has a collection of minerals from the Rhodope mountains.

The Museum of Aviation was established on 21 September 1991 on the territory of the Krumovo airbase to the southeast of the city. The museum possesses 59 aircraft and indoor and outdoor exhibitions.

The Old Town of Plovdiv is a historic preservation site known for its Bulgarian Renaissance architectural style. The Old Town covers the area of the three central hills (Трихълмие, &quot;Trihalmie&quot;). Almost every house in the Old Town has its characteristic exterior and interior decoration.
===Churches, mosques and temples===
There are a number of 19th-century churches, most of which follow the distinctive Eastern Orthodox construction style. They are the Saint Constantine and Saint Helena, the Saint Marina, the Saint Nedelya, the Saint Petka, and the Holy Mother of God Churches. As the city has been a gathering center for Orthodox Christians for a long period of time, Plovdiv is surrounded by several monasteries located at the foot of the Rhodope Mountains such as &quot;St. George&quot;, &quot;St. Kozma and Damian&quot;, St. Kirik, and Yulita (Ulita). They remain good examples of the late Middle Age Orthodox architecture and iconography masterpieces typical for the region. There are also Roman Catholic cathedrals in Plovdiv, the Cathedral of St Louis being the largest. There are several more modern Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and other Protestant churches, as well as older style Apostolic churches.

Two mosques remain in Plovdiv from the time of Ottoman rule. The Djumaya Mosque is considered the oldest European mosque outside Moorish Spain.

The Sephardic Plovdiv Synagogue is at Tsar Kaloyan Street 13 in the remnants of a small courtyard in what was once a large Jewish quarter. Dating to the 19th century, it is one of the best-preserved examples of the so-called &quot;Ottoman-style&quot; synagogues in the Balkans. According to author Ruth E. Gruber, the interior of the Plovdiv Synagogue is a &quot;hidden treasure...a glorious, if run-down, burst of color.&quot; An exquisite Venetian glass chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, which has a richly painted dome. All surfaces are covered in elaborate, Moorish-style, geometric designs in once-bright greens and blues. Torah scrolls are kept in the gilded Aron-ha-Kodesh.

== Culture ==

Although it is located in the middle of a rich agricultural region, Plovdiv&#x27;s economy has shifted from agriculture to industry since the beginning of the 20th century. Food processing, tobacco, brewing, and textiles formed the pillars of the industrial economic shift. During Communist rule, the city&#x27;s economy expanded and was dominated by heavy industry. After the fall of Communism in 1989 and the collapse of Bulgaria&#x27;s planned economy, a number of industrial complexes were closed; production of lead and zinc, machinery, electronics, motor trucks, chemicals, and cosmetics have continued.

Plovdiv is the economic capital of Bulgaria as it has the country&#x27;s largest economy and contributes 7.5% of Bulgaria&#x27;s GDP . In 2014, more than 35 thousand companies operate in the region which create jobs for 285,000 people. The advantages of Plovdiv include the central geographic location, good infrastructure, and large population. Plovdiv has an international airport, terminal for intermodal transport, several connections with Trakia motorway (connecting Sofia and Burgas), proximity to Maritsa motorway (the main corridor to Turkey), and well-developed road and rail infrastructure which all led to the development of the city as the leading city in terms of industrial output in Bulgaria. Established in 1970, the Toplofikatsiya Plovdiv company provides generation of electric power and heat and heat distribution for Plovdiv.

The economy of Plovdiv has long tradition in manufacturing, commerce, transport, communications, and tourism. Apart from the industrial development of Plovdiv, there has been a significant surge in the IT and outsourcing service sector in the recent years, as well as a double-digit increase in the tourism growth in the city every year for the past 5 years.

<text>Hugh Richardson (21 July 1826 – 15 July 1913) was a stipendiary magistrate for the Assiniboia district of the North-West Territories of Canada. Richardson was the man who, at the conclusion of the 1885 trial of Louis Riel, sentenced Riel to hang, and who at the 1885 trial of Big Bear sentenced Big Bear to three years in prison.

Richardson was born in London, England in 1826 and came to York (later Toronto) with his family in 1831. He studied at Osgoode Hall Law School, was called to the bar in 1847 and set up practice in Woodstock. He was crown attorney for Oxford County from 1856 to 1862. He helped organize the local militia battalion, later becoming commander, and served at La Prairie, Canada East in 1865 with Colonel Garnet Joseph Wolseley and at Sarnia during the Fenian raids. After he was named a stipendiary magistrate in 1876, he moved to Battleford, North-West Territories; in 1883, he moved to Regina after the seat of government for the territories was moved there. He was in 1887 appointed senior judge of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories. Richardson served as acting lieutenant governor for the territories in 1897 and in 1898. He retired in 1903 and returned to Ottawa; his daughter Mary, who had married Donald Alexander Macdonald, was living there.

He died in Ottawa in 1913 and is interred in the cemetery of the St. Thomas Anglican (&quot;Old English&quot;) Church, in St. Thomas, Ontario.

<doc id="182557" wikidata="Q2782381" url="?curid=182557" title="Jewish fundamentalism">
<text>Jewish fundamentalism (Hebrew: ) refers to fundamentalism in the context of Judaism. The term &quot;fundamentalism&quot; was originally used in reference to Christian fundamentalism, a Protestant movement which emphasizes a belief in biblical literalism. Today, it is commonly used in reference to movements that oppose modernist, liberal, and ecumenical tendencies within societies as well as modernist, liberal and ecumenical tendencies within specific religions and it is often coupled with extremist ideologies and/or political movements. The use of this definition is important in a Jewish context because the two movements which are most commonly associated with Jewish fundamentalism, Religious Zionism and Haredi Judaism, stray far from biblical literalism due to the importance of the Oral Law within Judaism. In fact, Karaism, the Jewish movement which is well-known due to its emphasis on biblical literalism, is rarely considered fundamentalist.

== Overview ==
Like other fundamentalist movements, fundamentalist Judaism usually presents itself as the only valid form of Judaism, Jewish culture, and truth. However, Religious Zionism and Haredi Judaism, the two movements which are most broadly associated with Jewish fundamentalism, differ in significant ways and historically, they have opposed each other (but recently, there has been more overlap due to the rise of the Hardal movement). Religious Zionism is more associated with political extremism while Haredi Judaism is associated with men studying torah every day and making sure all actions are in line with the will of Hashem.

== Haredi Judaism ==
Haredi Judaism consists of groups within Orthodox Judaism that are characterized by their strict adherence to &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law) and traditions in opposition to modern values and practices. Its members are usually referred to as ultra-Orthodox in English; however, the term &quot;ultra-Orthodox&quot; is considered pejorative by many of its adherents, who prefer terms like strictly Orthodox or Haredi. Haredi Jews regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of Jews, but other movements of Judaism disagree.

== Religious Zionism == 

Religious Zionism is an ideology that combines Zionism and Orthodox Judaism. It primarily began with the teachings of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook (1865–1935), who saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme to return Jews to their ancestral homeland and eventually bring about the coming of the Messiah. Religious Zionism gained a new momentum after the Six-Day War in 1967, when Israel conquered the West Bank, a territory which is rich in Biblical history. The Gush Emunim movement took off under the leadership of Zvi Yehuda Kook and it also spearheaded the proliferation of Israeli settlements in the newly conquered territory.

Religious Zionism is still a relatively broad term which encompasses both moderate and extremist elements. The extremist elements are frequently associated with anti-Arab racism, anti-Palestinianism and violence, frequently, they are associated with ideological inspiration from Kahanism. They have also been associated with terrorism against Palestinians and in some cases, they have also been associated with terrorism against the Israel Defense Forces. The Hilltop Youth movement is especially associated with the most extreme forms of Religious Zionism.

== Study ==
Jewish fundamentalism was ignored for much of the 20th century, and it was only when it began to have an effect on Israeli politics and international relations that scholars began to study it in earnest.

<doc id="182560" wikidata="Q458700" url="?curid=182560" title="Ami Popper">
<text>Ami Popper (; born June 2, 1969) is an Israeli terrorist who committed the Oyoun Qara massacre on 20 May 1990, killing 7 Palestinians at a bus stop in Rishon Lezion, Israel. Popper was arrested and charged with 7 counts of murder for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment, later commuted to 40 years.

==Background==
Ami Popper was born in 1969 in Rishon Lezion, Israel, and had served in the Israel Defense Force (IDF) until he was dishonorably discharged. Reportedly, Popper was punished for inappropriate use of weapons during his military service, where he had attempted to commit suicide, for which he was imprisoned.

==Murders==
On May 20, 1990, Popper stole IDF uniform trousers, an IMI Galil, and five box magazines full of ammunition from his brother, an active duty soldier. At around 6:15 a.m., Popper spotted a group of Palestinian Arab workers from the Gaza Strip at a bus stop in Rishon Lezion, who were waiting to be picked up from their laboring jobs in Israel. Suspecting they were Arab, he demanded to see their identity cards, and after confirming they were Arabs he ordered them to line up in three rows, on their knees. A group of passengers in a passing car with Gaza plates were also stopped and forced to kneel with them. Popper then opened fire with the Galil rifle, killing 7 Palestinians immediately and a further 10/11 were wounded badly, before leaving the scene in his car. Palestinian reports allege that, on arriving at the scene, Israeli police proceeded to beat up the surviving victims. Within an hour, he was arrested.

Palestinians throughout the territories protested, resulting in clashes between protesters and Israeli security forces. While suppressing the protests, a further seven people were killed, including a 14-year-old boy. After a week of clashes, 19 Palestinians were killed, while around 700 more suffered injuries. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir dismissed the murders as an act of no political significance since Popper was &quot;deranged&quot;, however the court found Popper sane and fit to stand trial. Popper first told police that his attacks were a reaction to the First Intifada, later claiming to have been distraught because his girlfriend had decided to leave him. He also stated that he had been raped by an Arab when he was 13 years old and had committed these killings out of shame and a desire for revenge. Two days later rabbi Meir Kahane held a celebration of his deed in Rishon LeZion.

==Conviction and aftermath==
Popper was charged and convicted of seven acts of murder in March 1991, and he was sentenced to seven terms of life imprisonment. While in prison Popper became devoutly religious, and in June 1993 he married a Canadian-Jewish woman from a family of Kach activists. Popper and his wife were granted conjugal visits, and they had three children. In 1999, his sentence was reduced to 40 years imprisonment by a presidential amnesty. Popper was initially imprisoned in Maasiyahu Prison, and was placed in the Torani cellblock, a special cellblock for religious inmates. Prisoners there pray three times a day and spend most of the day studying the Torah and other sacred texts. At one point, his cellmate was former minister Shlomo Benizri. After Benizri&#x27;s release, Popper&#x27;s influence in the Torani bloc grew, and he began harassing former President Moshe Katsav, serving a seven-year sentence for rape and other sexual offenses, as Katsav had refused Popper&#x27;s request for a pardon while he was president. According to the Israel Prison Service, Popper had verbally abused Katsav and sent other inmates to harass him. In October 2012, Popper was transferred to the maximum-security Ayalon Prison. Right wing and Orthodox politicians in Israel have demanded his release along with other Israeli prisoners who were convicted of murder or other violence committed against Palestinians, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners who committed murder or violence against Israelis.

On 17 January 2007, while on a 48-hour furlough from prison, Popper was involved in a car accident he caused by crossing a solid line, hitting oncoming traffic. His wife and one of his sons were killed in the accident. Popper himself was moderately injured. Police reported that Popper&#x27;s driver&#x27;s license had expired in 1999, and that he was driving illegally without a license. Initial reports indicate Popper&#x27;s children were not wearing seatbelts in the backseat.

Popper later remarried and then divorced. In May 2013, he married his third wife, a woman known only as &quot;M&quot; who had previously made headlines by allegedly allowing her children to be abused. The couple was married in a small ceremony in Jerusalem, after Popper was granted a prison furlough. Popper&#x27;s family has been the recipient of financial support from the Israeli NGO Honenu, and indirectly from tax deductible U.S. donations, according to journalist Uri Blau.

<text>Weezer (also known as the Green Album) is the third studio album by American rock band Weezer. It was released on May 15, 2001, by Geffen Records. It was the second Weezer album produced by Ric Ocasek, who produced their debut album, and it is the only studio album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh (who replaced Matt Sharp), as he left the band a few months after the album&#x27;s release.

After the mixed critical reception and underwhelming sales of their second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot; (1996), Weezer went on hiatus and the band members worked on side projects. During this time, their fanbase grew online and &quot;Pinkerton&quot;&#x27;s standing improved. After a comeback performance at the Japanese Summer Sonic Festival, Weezer began rehearsing and recording new material. Following the ambitious compositions and confessional themes of &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote simpler songs with less personal lyrics.

Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Hash Pipe&quot;, &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;, and &quot;Photograph&quot;. &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; was a worldwide hit, charting on seven different charts. &quot;Weezer&quot; received generally favorable reviews. It debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it has since sold over 1.6 million copies.

== Background ==

Weezer&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, was released on September 24, 1996. It received mixed reviews upon release and sold poorly compared to Weezer&#x27;s 1994 debut, primarily due to its darker, more abrasive sound. Following the &quot;Pinkerton&quot; tour, Weezer went on hiatus. Frontman Rivers Cuomo returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, he formed a new band, Homie.

By February 1998, Cuomo had disbanded Homie and headed to Los Angeles to begin work on Weezer demos with guitarist Brian Bell and drummer Patrick Wilson. Bassist Matt Sharp was absent from rehearsals and became estranged from the band. On April 8, 1998, Sharp announced his exit from Weezer to devote his energy to his band the Rentals. It was quickly announced that former Homie bassist Mikey Welsh would take over on bass for Weezer.

Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals. In late 1998, Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo. Cuomo became depressed; he painted the walls of his home black and put &quot;fiberglass insulation all over the windows and then black sheets of fiberglass so that no light could get through&quot;. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from contact with the outside world. He also had braces put on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem.

By 1999, the members of Weezer had again gone their separate ways; Wilson resumed work with his band the Special Goodness, Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo wrote 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him.

Unbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was connecting and growing on the internet, and &quot;Pinkerton&quot;&#x27;s critical and commercial standing was improving. Weezer accepted a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival; rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band. They returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.

Eventually, Weezer performed higher-profile gigs such as the Warped Tour. Cuomo said: &quot;We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed.&quot; The response led to further shows. MP3 demos captured live on the band&#x27;s mobile unit and soundchecks surfaced on file-sharing services and eventually were released as downloads on the Weezer website. These songs are often referred to as &quot;Summer Songs of 2000&quot;.

== Recording ==
On October 23, 2000, Cuomo announced that Weezer would start recording material &quot;with or without&quot; a producer. However, the band&#x27;s record label decided to have the band employ a record producer due to the commercial failure of their self-produced album &quot;Pinkerton.&quot; The band began rehearsing and arranging both the &quot;Summer Songs of 2000&quot; and newer material Cuomo had written at his home with engineer Chad Bamford. The band eventually decided to hire Ric Ocasek—who had also produced their debut album—as producer, and began sending demos to Ocasek during the summer of 2000. There was much debate among the band members as to whether they should record in Los Angeles or Ocasek&#x27;s New York home, with the band eventually deciding to record in Los Angeles at Cello Studios. The band continued to demo new music daily and started to work through more than seventy-five demos, eventually homing in on twenty-five potential album tracks in anticipation of Ocasek&#x27;s arrival. Ocasek worked with the band to trim these down further to eighteen songs.

After the mixed reception to &quot;Pinkerton,&quot; Cuomo wrote simpler songs with less personal lyrics; he stated the songs &quot;very intentionally not about me. Not about what was going on in my life, at least in a conscious way.&quot; Recording sessions began in early December, with Ocasek providing feedback by telephone. On December 27, the band embarked on what would be close to six weeks of studio work by playing songs repetitively in order to track the bass and drums parts. They also did &quot;scratch takes&quot; of the vocals and guitar, designed to get accurate rhythm tracks before being redone more efficiently later in the recording process. While recording the album, the band continued to perform gigs under the pseudonym Goat Punishment.

During the recording sessions, an executive at the band&#x27;s label, Geffen Records, visited to observe the band&#x27;s progress and expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks. This feedback eventually forced the band to discard a few of the album&#x27;s possible songs. The band relocated for three weeks to a smaller studio in another part of Cello Studios where Cuomo and Bell worked on guitar takes while the entire band recorded vocal tracks. Ocasek said: &quot;Rivers always does his guitar parts in one take.&quot; Mixing began on January 31 by Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studios inside the Marlin Hotel, Miami Beach, Florida.

== Packaging ==

Art direction was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch. It is similar to the cover art of Weezer&#x27;s debut album.

The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Welsh, Cuomo, Bell and Wilson standing left to right in front of a plain, lime-green backdrop in a manner similar to the band&#x27;s debut album. This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek, who had also produced their first album, and also to symbolize the band&#x27;s back-to-basics approach they took while recording the album. This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album: &quot;Torniamo all&#x27;antico e sarà un progresso&quot;, from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means &quot;Let us return to old times and that will be progress.&quot;

The picture inside of the CD booklet is a photo of Weezer playing live, featuring (in the lower right hand corner) an overlay of the silhouettes of Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot from the television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. (Hence the liner note citation &quot;MST3K silhouette appears courtesy of Best Brains, Inc.&quot;)

This was Weezer&#x27;s first album to feature a transparent CD tray. Under the CD tray of the album, the word &quot;No&quot; can be found on the back of the spine. Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead&#x27;s album &quot;OK Computer&quot; which contains the text &quot;I like you. I like you. You are a wonderful person. I&#x27;m full of enthusiasm. I&#x27;m going places. I&#x27;ll be happy to help you. I am an important person, would you like to come home with me?&quot; Weezer&#x27;s explanation was vague, with webmaster Karl Koch stating &quot;No means no.&quot;

The album contains the dedication &quot;In loving memory of Mykel and Carli.&quot; Mykel and Carli Allan were sisters devoted to developing fan clubs for up-and-coming bands. The sisters had been influential in starting and developing Weezer&#x27;s official fan club in the 1990s and, along with their younger sister Trysta, died in a car accident in 1997.

== Promotion ==
The album was met with enthusiasm from the record label; according to Weezer collaborator Karl Koch, &quot;They had nothing but supportive and excited things to say about it.&quot; However, the album&#x27;s original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo&#x27;s choice of &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; as the first single. Citing the song&#x27;s lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate, they suggested that &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot; be chosen as the first single. However, Cuomo continued to fight and &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; eventually became the album&#x27;s first single. The label tried to postpone the release date further until June, but the band convinced them to adhere to the May 15 release date.

The video for &quot;Hash Pipe&quot; was directed by Marcos Siega and was the first of many Weezer videos directed by Siega. In the video, Weezer performs in an arena while a group of sumo wrestlers are fighting in the background. The song title was often censored as &quot;H*** Pipe&quot; (the title employed on the music video&#x27;s title card) or &quot;Half Pipe&quot;. The song became a hit on the MTV show &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, and also received heavy rotation on radio, peaking at number two on the US Modern Rock Charts. The song was nominated for &quot;High Times&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Pot Song of the Year&quot;.

The next single, &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;, was a radio hit and became one of Weezer&#x27;s biggest overseas hits. It peaked at number 11 on the US Modern Rock Charts and at number 31 on the UK Top 40. Two music videos were created for the song: the first video, directed by Marcos Siega, shows Weezer playing the song at a Mexican couple&#x27;s wedding reception and features all four band members. The executives at MTV disliked Siega&#x27;s video, prompting the band to film a second video.

After suffering a breakdown from the stress of touring, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and drug abuse, Welsh attempted suicide and left Weezer in 2001. Without him, the band filmed a second video for &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;, directed by Spike Jonze and featured the band playing with wild animals. Sharp may have been approached to be in the video. Scott Shriner, who was filling in for Welsh and later became a permanent member of Weezer, stated in the commentary for &quot;Video Capture Device&quot; that he almost asked the band to let him appear in the video. The second video received much wider airplay than the original and has become the standard video for the song.

The third and final single from the album was &quot;Photograph&quot;, which was released to radio in early November. The single peaked at number 17 on the US Modern Rock Charts. In Japan it was released as the first single instead of &quot;Hash Pipe.&quot; The band felt the song didn&#x27;t have the staying power of the previous singles, and thus decided to pass on a big-name director for the music video, opting instead to have Karl Koch shoot and edit a video from on-the-road footage. It was the band&#x27;s first music video featuring Shriner.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Weezer&quot; received generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. Reviewing the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob Sheffield wrote that the band had made &quot;a totally crunk geek-punk record, buzzing through ten excellent tunes in less than half an hour with zero filler&quot;. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that while &quot;Weezer&quot; is essentially &quot;just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks&quot;, &quot;nobody else&quot; excels at the style as successfully as Weezer does on the album, which he felt ranked among the best rock records of 2001. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the &quot;Green Album&quot; as the &quot;anti-&quot;Pinkerton&quot;&quot;, with album art and &quot;squeaky-clean&quot; production that recalled Weezer&#x27;s debut. The album was compared to the 1999 film &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; by Rob Mitchum of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who stated &quot;Both sci-fi epic and alt-rock record were long-awaited events that had even the most jaded hipster hopping around like a small child with a full bladder.&quot;

Neva Chonin of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; called it &quot;a sublime selection of power-pop songs with enough lyrical ballast to keep them from floating away on their own euphoria&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; critic Jason Thompson credited the band for their decision to have Ric Ocasek return as producer, as did &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Evan Serpick, who viewed the album as &quot;a return to their winning formula of sugary power pop and smart-assed rants&quot;. Russell Bailie of &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; remarked that &quot;the self-conscious nerd-factor of old seems largely and happily absent&quot; on an album that &quot;sounds like a revitalisation with a hint of maturity&quot;.

Writing in &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Stephen Thompson found that &quot;Weezer&quot; &quot;feels a bit repetitive and perfunctory the first time through&quot;, but &quot;nonetheless finds Weezer sounding revitalized in every way.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani described it as &quot;fillerless&quot; and without &quot;much to complain about&quot;, despite the lack of songs that &quot;hit the spot&quot; like the singles from Weezer&#x27;s debut. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Spencer Owen was more critical, finding the album &quot;average from beginning to end&quot; and lacking in the &quot;sense of dynamics and intricacy that &quot;Pinkerton&quot; – and especially their debut – held in spades&quot;. Sarah Dempster from &quot;NME&quot; was similarly disappointed: &quot;The most irritating aspect of the &quot;Green Album&quot; is... the maddening itch of wasted opportunity.&quot;

&quot;Weezer&quot; placed at number 21 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 2001. The album ranked at number 3 in &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;″s list of the best albums of 2001, while &quot;Spin&quot; named it the year&#x27;s ninth best album. &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; both listed it as one of the best albums of the year. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Laura Marie Braun wrote in 2016 that the success of &quot;Weezer&quot; helped give Rivers Cuomo an &quot;ego boost&quot; after the initial lukewarm critical reception to &quot;Pinkerton&quot;, which in turn helped him reconcile his own conflicted feelings about that album.

<text>Springfield is a town in Windsor County, Vermont, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,062.

==History==

The land currently recognized as Springfield is the traditional land of the Pennacook and Abenaki people.

One of the New Hampshire grants, the township was chartered on August 20, 1761, by Governor Benning Wentworth and awarded to Gideon Lyman and 61 others. Although Springfield&#x27;s alluvial flats made it among the best agricultural towns in the state, the Black River falls, which drop in , helped it develop into a mill town. Springfield was located in the center of the Precision Valley region, home of the Vermont machine tool industry.

In 1888, the Jones and Lamson Machine Tool Company (J&amp;L) moved to Springfield from Windsor, Vermont under the successful leadership of James Hartness. Gaining international renown for precision and innovation, J&amp;L ushered in a new era of precision manufacturing in the area. Edwin R. Fellows co-founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company here in 1896. As knowledge and infrastructure grew to support precision machining, other companies such as the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company and Lovejoy Tool formed, grew, and provided much of the economic engine.

Springfield Telescope Makers, the oldest amateur telescope making club in the United States, has been based in Springfield since its inception in 1923 by Russell W. Porter. The club&#x27;s pink clubhouse at the Stellafane Observatory was built in 1923 on Breezy Hill, just south of Springfield village, and has hosted an annual convention for astronomers and telescope makers nearly every summer since 1926. Many notable figures in the fields of astronomy and space exploration have attended the convention over the years.

During World War II, Springfield&#x27;s production of machine tools was of such importance to the American war effort that the US government ranked Springfield (together with the Cone Automatic Machine Company of nearby Windsor) as the seventh most important bombing target in the country.

Springfield is also home to the Eureka Schoolhouse, the oldest one-room school in the state of Vermont. Completed in 1790, the building was in continuous use until 1900 and was restored in 1968 by the Vermont Board of Historic Sites. The school house was named by its first teacher, David Searle, who, after a long journey through the new frontier was heard to cry &quot;Eureka!&quot; upon reaching the new settlement of Springfield. The name stuck, and &quot;Eureka&quot; can still be found in street and business names throughout Springfield.

Several sites in Springfield, including the historic downtown area, have been designated as having historical significance according to the National Register of Historic Places. Among them are the Hartness House (original home of the entrepreneur and governor) and the Gould&#x27;s Mill Bridge, a steel truss bridge.

On July 10, 2007, Springfield was selected to host the premiere of &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, which, like the &quot;Simpsons&quot; TV show, is set in a town called Springfield. In a Fox competition, Vermont was chosen to host the opening for over 13 other places around the nation called Springfield.

<text>John Taylor (25 September 1942 – 17 July 2015) was a British jazz pianist, born in Manchester, England, who occasionally performed on the organ and the synthesizer. In his obituary, The Guardian described him as &quot;one of the great jazz pianists and composers of his generation&quot; and at a musical level comparable to Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, McCoy Tyner and Brad Meldhau. 

== Early life ==
John Taylor was a self-taught pianist. With his family, he moved from Manchester, first to the Midlands and then to Hastings where he played locally. In 1964, Taylor became a civil servant, moved to London and became involved in the free jazz scene.

==Performing career==
Taylor first came to the attention of the jazz community in 1969, when he partnered with saxophonists Alan Skidmore and John Surman. He was later reunited with Surman in the short-lived group Morning Glory and, in the 1980s, with Miroslav Vitous&#x27;s quartet.

In the early 1970s, Taylor was accompanist to the singer Cleo Laine and started to compose for his own sextet. He also worked with many visiting artists at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London, and later became a member of Scott&#x27;s quintet.

In 1977, Taylor formed the trio Azimuth, with Norma Winstone and Kenny Wheeler. On some of the group&#x27;s recordings, Taylor played synthesiser and organ. The group was described by Richard Williams as &quot;one of the most imaginatively conceived and delicately balanced contemporary chamber-jazz groups&quot;. The trio made several recordings for ECM Records and performed in Europe, the US and Canada.

The 1980s saw Taylor working with groups led by Jan Garbarek, Enrico Rava, Gil Evans, Lee Konitz and Charlie Mariano, as well as performing in duos with Tony Coe and Steve Argüelles. Composing projects included a commission for the English choir Cantamus Girls Choir with Lee Konitz and Steve Argüelles and pieces for the Hannover Radio Orchestra with Stan Sulzmann. Taylor also performed on David Sylvian&#x27;s song &quot;Laughter and Forgetting&quot;, on which Kenny Wheeler also featured.

From 2006, Taylor was a member of Kenny Wheeler&#x27;s quartet and large ensemble and performed in duo and quartet settings with John Surman; their recording of &quot;Ambleside Days&quot; on ahum won critical acclaim. In 1996 Taylor played organ on Surman&#x27;s choral work &quot;Proverbs and Songs&quot; from Salisbury Cathedral, later released on ECM Records. During the 1990s, he made several recordings also for ECM with Peter Erskine&#x27;s trio with Palle Danielsson on bass.

In 2000, Taylor made a new collaboration with Azimuth and the Smith Quartet for the Weimar Festival. Also in that year, he recorded &quot;Verso&quot; with Maria Pia De Vito and Ralph Towner.

Taylor celebrated his 60th birthday in 2002 with a Contemporary Music Network Tour, in which he presented his new trio with drummer Joey Baron and Marc Johnson on bass. The tour also featured the Creative Jazz Orchestra playing Taylor&#x27;s composition &quot;The Green Man Suite&quot;. In July 2002, Taylor received the BBC Jazz Award for &#x27;Best New Work&#x27; for this suite.

Taylor&#x27;s trio recording with Johnson and Baron was released early in 2003, and September 2003 saw the release of his solo CD &quot;Insight&quot; on Sketch. John Fordham wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;This is one of contemporary jazz&#x27;s great performers at work ... a beautiful solo statement by a very modest star.&quot; In 2004, Taylor recorded &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot; in duo with Kenny Wheeler and &quot;Nightfall&quot; with bassist Charlie Haden. They subsequently performed at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Also that year Taylor formed a new trio with Palle Danielsson and Martin France. They performed at the Vancouver Jazz Festival and recorded &quot;Angel of the Presence&quot; for CAM Jazz. This recording was released in January 2006 to coincide with their UK tour and has received critical acclaim.

==Keyboard style==
While Taylor&#x27;s unique piano style drew on the whole of the jazz pallette and considerable influence from classical music, his approach was characterised by a sophisticated and advanced rhythmic and harmonic sensibility. Rhythmically he specialised in asymmetrical meters and in employing &quot;drumming&quot; patterns on the keyboard. Harmonically, he significantly developed and expanded the harmonic vocabulary of musicians such as Bill Evans and Gil Evans.

==Teaching==
Taylor was professor of Jazz Piano at the Cologne College of Music from 1993 onwards, and became a lecturer in jazz at University of York in 2005. He coached and taught undergraduate jazz musicians and was of central importance to the new master&#x27;s degree jazz pathway and in advancing doctoral research and performance in jazz.

==Family==
Taylor was married to jazz vocalist Norma Winstone from 1972 until their divorce. The couple had two sons: Leo Taylor, a drummer with indie rock band The Invisible; and Alex Taylor, a singer-songwriter. John Taylor was married to Diana (née de Courcy) until her death in 2004 from cancer, and his subsequent marriage to childhood sweetheart Carol Weston, lasted for the rest of his life.

==Death==
Taylor died on 17 July 2015, following a heart attack he suffered while performing at the Saveurs Jazz Festival in Segré, France. Although he was resuscitated at the venue, he died after being taken to hospital.

<doc id="182590" wikidata="Q491058" url="?curid=182590" title="Voluntary Agency Network of Korea">
<text>The Voluntary Agency Network of Korea (), abbreviated VANK (), is an Internet-based South Korean organization established by Park Ki-Tae in 1999, consisting of 120,000 South Korean members and 30,000 international members. VANK&#x27;s membership consists mainly of junior high and high school students, although university students also participate.

==Activities==
Examples of campaigns they have conducted include organizing a protests movement to pressure Google and Apple to label the Liancourt rocks as Dokto on their maps and spreading the story of the ancient kingdom of Goguryeo, and about &quot;Jikji&quot;, the world&#x27;s oldest extant book printed using movable metal type.

VANK publishes reading materials, postcards, maps, and videos. VANK&#x27;s self-built online database and published books with information about Korea are acknowledged by overseas universities as recommended learning resources about Korea. As a way to exchange cultures and connect with foreigners, VANK also conducts surveys about their opinions of Korea, such as a notable survey about what aspects of Korea interest foreigners the most.

VANK disputes certain terms and information regarding Asian geographic names or about East Asian history. The head of the Voluntary Agency Network of Korea said the organization has corrected hundreds of mistaken statements by foreign governments about South Korea. VANK also raises awareness for Japanese war crimes and promotes the banning and removal of symbolism they associate with Imperial Japan. 

In 2013, VANK launched a campaign against the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. The campaign included a letter to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) opposing the games because &quot;Japan has no remorse for war crimes.”, the letter was also sent to major foreign media such as CNN and the New York Times. On January 6, 2020, a poster was put on a temporary fence on the site of the new Japanese embassy in Jong Chiyo Road, Nono District. In the posters, the Tokyo Games are contaminated by nuclear radiation, in one scene the Olympic Torch Relay is depicted with a man in a hazmat suit transporting radioactive material. Stamps and coins bearing similar imagery were also produced.

In 2019, VANK launched a campaign against the expression Chinese New Year, recommending the term &quot;lunar new year&quot; instead.

In 2020, VANK urged Chinese netizens to stop cyberbullying Korean celebrity singer Lee Hyo-ri after her Instagram account received several complaints and criticisms. VANK posted an online petition titled &quot;Stop China&#x27;s cyber chauvinism which lynched a Korean celebrity!&quot;. It justified the petition on the basis &quot;We oppose the chauvinistic attitude of attacking others in the name of nationalism, which includes interpreting even the smallest part of an expression in the most vicious and offensive way&quot;.

==Funding==
VANK is a non-governmental and private organization. According to VANK, they do not receive money from any organization or corporation, and are run by donations.

== Political position ==

VANK does not represent an official political position, but the organization is believed to be politically closer to a liberal-to-progressive camp than to a conservative camp one. 

In South Korea, liberals and leftists tend to show more anti-imperialist and left-wing nationalist based diplomatic views than conservatives in diplomacy involving powerful countries, including China and Japan. Because of this tendency, conservatives support reducing VANK&#x27;s government subsidies, while liberals and leftists support increasing VANK&#x27;s government subsidies.

== Criticism ==
VANK organizes young Korean students as &quot;cyber diplomats&quot; to lobby foreign organizations and webmasters about what it perceives as errors in matters related to Korea. The Government of Korea endorses such &quot;cyber vigilantism&quot;, subsidising a competition in which participants try to censor foreign websites for &quot;incorrect&quot; content about Korea. Park Jung-yul, an official of The Korean Information Service (KOIS) said &quot;KOIS is resolved to monitor the contents of Korea-related Web sites and provide correct information on the Net in order to help generate an accurate image of the country.&quot; In &quot;Asia Times Online&quot;, it was reported that the South Korean government is offering rewards to students who participate in the activities of VANK, most of which are centered on the issues of the Sea of Japan.

VANK lists current targets for &quot;correction&quot; on its website for members to send a form letter of protest. Some of its requests for correction are justifiable, such as referring to a simple mistake mixing up North and South Korea. However, in relation to more highly contentious issues it does not accept any non-Korean interpretations. In a Foreign Policy article, VANK was described as being seen as &quot;self-styled cyber fact-checkers&quot; to those favourable to their cause but for others they are seen as &quot;hyper-nationalistic spammers&quot;.

Although official foreign government agencies tend to endure its cyber harassment, numerous private organisations and websites surrender to silence VANK&#x27;s clamour. An &quot;About.com&quot; spokesman, relating his company&#x27;s decision to use the name &quot;East Sea&quot; to refer to the body of water otherwise known as the Sea of Japan, stated that they chose to use the name &quot;not necessarily because it agreed with the South Korean geography activists but because the e-mail bombardment was annoying.&quot; In the About.com case, it received more than 20 e-mails per day for more than a year before it finally changed the name. Likewise, the National Geographic Society and other websites have changed their naming policies as a result of similar &quot;e-mail and letter writing campaigns&quot;.

VANK has been accused of promoting Korea while attacking Japan. Critics claim that VANK has attempted to bully and discount Japan and Japanese culture, manipulate history during and after World War II and have other countries believe in distorted perspectives related to Japanese-Korean history that have a bias favoring Korea. VANK has also been accused of attacking China and Chinese culture.

<doc id="182594" wikidata="Q398989" url="?curid=182594" title="Tōkai region">
<text>The is a subregion of the Chūbu region and Kansai region in Japan that runs along the Pacific Ocean. The name comes from the Tōkaidō, one of the Edo Five Routes. Because Tōkai is a sub-region and is not officially classified, there is some disagreement about where exactly the region begins and ends, however Japanese maps widely conclude that the region includes Shizuoka, Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures.

The largest major city in the region is Nagoya and the Chūkyō Metropolitan Area (Nagoya Metropolitan Area) makes up a large portion of the region and has Japan&#x27;s third strongest economy. The business influence of this urban area sometimes extends out into the outlying areas of the three prefectures centered on Nagoya which are Aichi, Gifu, and Mie; this area is sometimes referred to as the Chūkyō region.

Tōkai is a heavy manufacturing area and is one of the most industrial regions in Japan. Its coast is lined with densely populated cities with economies that thrive on factories.

The Tōkai region has experienced a number of large earthquakes in the past, including the two great earthquakes in 1944 (also known as the &quot;Tonankai earthquake&quot;) and 1945 (also known as the &quot;Mikawa earthquake&quot;). Following the work of Kiyoo Mogi, it is predicted that there is a possibility that the area will be subject to a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the near future. Nagoya, Shizuoka, and other large cities would be greatly damaged, with potential casualties in the tens of thousands. The Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction designated the region as an Area of Specific Observation in 1970, and upgraded it to an Area of Intensified Observation in 1974.

==Railroads==
Central Japan Railway Company, an arm of the former national railway Japan Railways Group, operates in an area roughly coextensive with the Tōkai region. In fact, JR Central&#x27;s official Japanese name is &quot;Tōkai Railway Company&quot;, abbreviated to &quot;JR-Tōkai&quot; (&quot;JR Central&quot; is the English name). JR Central operates the Tōkaidō Main Line between Atami and Maibara stations, as well as the Tōkaidō Shinkansen high speed line between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, and many conventional lines joining with the Tōkaidō Main Line.

== Economy ==
Economy of Tōkai subregion is largely based on the Chūkyō metropolitan area that lies within its borders. Note that the Chūkyō metropolitan area is also known as Greater Nagoya as the largest and most influential city of the metropolitan area is Nagoya. Automobile giants Toyota and Suzuki are located in Tōkai subregion. Yamaha corporation is also located in Tōkai subregion.

== Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, and, Tōkai subregion much like Chūkyō metropolitan area has experienced continuous population growth throughout the 20th century.

Since around 2010 though, the Tōkai subregion has experienced population decline.
