<text>Jay Cooke (August 10, 1821 – February 16, 1905) was an American financier who helped finance the Union war effort during the American Civil War and the postwar development of railroads in the northwestern United States. He is generally acknowledged as the first major investment banker in the United States and creator of the first wire house firm.

==Early life==

Cooke was born at Sandusky, Ohio, the son of Eleutheros Cooke and Martha Carswell Cooke. Eleutheros Cooke was a pioneer Ohio lawyer and Whig, a member of the Ohio General Assembly, and a member of Congress from Ohio from 1831 to 1833.

==Financier of the Civil War==

In 1838, Cooke went to Philadelphia, where he entered the banking house of E. W. Clark &amp; Co. as a clerk, and became a partner in 1842. He left this firm in 1858. On January 1, 1861, just months before the start of the American Civil War, Cooke opened the private banking house of Jay Cooke &amp; Company in Philadelphia. Soon after the war began, the state of Pennsylvania borrowed $3 million 
($ today) to fund its war efforts.

In the early months of the war, Cooke worked with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase to secure loans from the leading bankers in the Northern cities. (Cooke and his brother, a newspaper editor, had helped Chase get his job by lobbying for him, even though all were former Democrats.)

Cooke&#x27;s own firm was so successful in distributing Treasury notes that Chase engaged him as special agent to sell the $500 million in &quot;five-twenty&quot; bonds – callable in five years and matured in 20 years – authorized by Congress on February 25, 1862. The Treasury had previously tried and failed to sell these bonds. Promised a sales commission of 0.5 percent of the revenue from the first $10 million, and 0.375 percent of subsequent bonds, Cooke financed a nationwide sales campaign, appointing about 2,500 sub-agents who traveled through every northern and western state and territory, as well as the Southern states as they came under control of the Union Army. Meanwhile, Cooke secured the support of most Northern newspapers, purchasing ads through advertising agencies, and often working directly with editors on lengthy articles about the virtues of buying government bonds. These efforts heralded a particular type of patriotism based on classical liberalist notions of self-interest. His editorials, articles, handbills, circulars, and signs most often appealed to Americans&#x27; desire to turn a profit, while simultaneously aiding the war effort. Cooke quickly sold the $500 million in bonds, and $11 million more. Congress immediately sanctioned the excess.

Cooke influenced the establishment of national banks, and organized a national bank at Washington and another at Philadelphia almost as quickly as Congress could authorize the institutions.

In the early months of 1865, the government faced pressing financial needs. After the national banks saw disappointing sales of &quot;seven-thirty&quot; notes, the government again turned to Cooke. He sent agents into remote villages and hamlets, and even into isolated mining camps in the west, and persuaded rural newspapers to praise the loan. Between February and July 1865, he disposed of three series of the notes, reaching a total of $830,000,000. This allowed the Union soldiers to be supplied and paid during the final months of the war.

It was in this effort that he pioneered the use of price stabilization. This practice, whereby bankers stabilize the price of a new issue, is still in use by investment bankers in IPOs and other security issuances.

Although Cooke&#x27;s bond campaigns were widely praised as a patriotic contribution to the Union cause, his huge personal financial gains did not go unnoticed. Notorious for stalling the deposit of bond proceeds into federal coffers, he was accused of corruption, and on December 22, 1862, Representative Charles R. Train proposed a Congressional investigation of the Treasury – though the investigation was never realized.

==Northern Pacific Railway==
Cooke moved to Duluth, Minnesota after purchasing land, particularly in Carlton and St. Louis counties, mostly through agricultural college scrip. He saw the lakes as a link to a &quot;Western Empire&quot; and wanted to make it a &quot;new Chicago.&quot; He bought bonds for the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad, part of the Northern Pacific Railway and secured an interest in the Western Land Association with the intent of uniting Lake Superior and the Mississippi, as well as reaching European markets through the Great Lakes. He believed the lumber industry would be furthered by the road which lay through hundreds of miles of white pine and hundreds more of bare prairie for settlers. The line was completed in 1870. Along with encouraging the Duluth lumber industry, Cooke built a grain elevator to store grain while the Great Lakes were icebound. Cooke&#x27;s investments brought other lumbermen to the area to purchase blocks of timber. However, in advancing the money for the work (especially on the railway), the firm overestimated its capital, and at the approach of the Panic of 1873 it was forced to suspend operations. Cooke himself was forced into bankruptcy. Jay Cooke was heavily involved in financial scandals with the Canadian government and caused the Prime Minister John A. Macdonald to lose his office in the 1873 election. Cooke&#x27;s shares in the Northern Pacific Railway were purchased for pennies on the dollar by George Stephen and Donald Smith, who then finished building the Canadian Pacific Railway.

In the mid-1860s, Cooke had taken his son-in-law, Charles D. Barney, into the firm. After Jay Cooke &amp; Company collapsed in the 1873 panic, Barney reorganized the firm as Chas. D. Barney &amp; Co. Jay Cooke, Jr.—Cooke&#x27;s son and Barney&#x27;s brother-in-law—joined the new firm as a minority partner.

By 1880, Cooke had met all his financial obligations, and through an investment in the Horn Silver Mine in Utah, had again become wealthy. He died in the Ogontz (now Elkins Park) section of Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania, on February 16, 1905.

==Personal life==
Cooke married Dorothea Elizabeth Allen in 1844; she died in 1871. He died in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, in 1905 at the age of 83.

===Summer home===
Cooke owned a summer home, constructed in 1864–65 and still standing, on the small island of Gibraltar in the Lake Erie harbor of Put-in-Bay, Ohio. John Brown&#x27;s son Owen was winter caretaker for some years. The island was a lookout for Commodore Perry during the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813.

==Philanthropy==
A devout Episcopalian, Cooke regularly gave 10 percent (a tithe) of his income for religious and charitable purposes. He donated funds to the Philadelphia Divinity School and for the building of Episcopal churches. These include St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, and St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church on South Bass Island, across the bay from his summer home on Gibraltar. After he had been forced to give up his Ogontz estate in bankruptcy, he later repurchased it and converted it into a school for girls.

==Legacy==
A number of geographic features are named in his honor, including:

* Jay Cooke State Park, a large state park located near Duluth, Minnesota
* The village of Cooke City, Montana
* Cooke Township in Cumberland County, Pennsylvania
* Jay Cooke Elementary School in Philadelphia
* Cooke Road in Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania
* Jay, Pitt, and Cooke streets in the Lakeside neighborhood of Duluth
* A statue of Jay Cooke by Henry Shrady is located in Jay Cooke Plaza near the intersection of 9th Avenue East and Superior Street in Duluth.

<doc id="181347" wikidata="Q83034" url="?curid=181347" title="Interjection">
<text>An interjection is a word or expression that occurs as an utterance on its own and expresses a spontaneous feeling, situation or reaction. It is a diverse category, encompassing many different parts of speech, such as exclamations &quot;(ouch!&quot;, &quot;wow!&quot;), curses (&quot;damn!&quot;), greetings (&quot;hey&quot;, &quot;bye&quot;), response particles (&quot;okay&quot;, &quot;oh!&quot;, &quot;m-hm&quot;, &quot;huh?&quot;), hesitation markers (&quot;uh&quot;, &quot;er&quot;, &quot;um&quot;), and other words (&quot;stop&quot;, &quot;cool&quot;). Due to its diverse nature, the category of interjections partly overlaps with a few other categories like profanities, discourse markers, and fillers. The use and linguistic discussion of interjections can be traced historically through the Greek and Latin Modistae over many centuries.

== Historical classification ==
Greek and Latin intellectuals as well as the Modistae have contributed to the different perspectives of interjections in language throughout history. The Greeks held that interjections fell into the grammatical category of adverbs. They thought interjections modified the verb much in the same way as adverbs do, thus interjections were closely connected to verbs.

Unlike their Greek counterparts, many Latin scholars took the position that interjections did not rely on verbs and were used to communicate emotions and abstract ideas. They considered interjections to be their own independent part of speech. Further, the Latin grammarians classified any small non-word utterances as interjections.

Several hundred years later, the 13th- and 14th-century Modistae took inconsistent approaches to interjections. Some, such as Thomas of Erfurt, agreed with the former Greeks that the interjection was closely tied to the verb while others like Siger of Courtrai held that the interjection was its own part of speech syntactically, much like the Latin scholars.

== Meaning and use ==
In contrast to typical words and sentences, the function of most interjections is related to an expression of feeling, rather than representing some idea or concept. Generally, interjections can be classified into three types of meaning: volitive, emotive, or cognitive.
* Volitive interjections function as imperative or directive expressions; requesting or demanding something from the addressee (e.g., &quot;Shh!&quot; = &quot;Be quiet!&quot;; &quot;Boo!&quot; as in &quot;&quot;Boo!&quot; she cried, jumping to frighten him&quot;)&quot;.
* Emotive interjections are used to express emotions, such as disgust and fear (e.g., &quot;Yuck!&quot; expressing disgust; &quot;Boo!&quot; signalling contempt as in &quot;Boo! Shame on you&quot; or by audience members or spectators after a performance).
* Cognitive interjections express thoughts which are more related to cognition, or information known to the speaker of the utterance (e.g., &quot;Um!&quot; indicating confusion or thinking). 
While there exists some apparent overlap between emotive and cognitive interjections, as both express a feeling, cognitive interjections can be seen as more related to knowledge of something (i.e., information previously known to the speaker, or recently learned).

== Distinctions and modern classification ==

=== Primary and secondary interjections ===

Interjections may be subdivided and classified in several ways. A common distinction is based on relations to other word categories: &quot;primary interjections&quot; are interjections first and foremost (examples: &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ouch!&quot;, &quot;Huh?&quot;), while &quot;secondary interjections&quot; are words from other categories that come to be used as interjections in virtue of their meaning (examples: &quot;Damn!&quot;, &quot;Hell!&quot;) Primary interjections are generally considered to be single words (&quot;Oh!&quot;, &quot;Wow&quot;!). Secondary interjections can consist of multi-word phrases, or interjectional phrases, (examples: &quot;sup!&quot; from &quot;What&#x27;s up?&quot;, &quot;Excuse me!&quot;, &quot;Oh dear!&quot;, &quot;Thank God!&quot;), but can also include single-word alarm words (&quot;Help!&quot;), swear and taboo words (&quot;Heavens!&quot;), and other words used to show emotion (&quot;Drats!&quot;). Although secondary interjections tend to interact more with the words around them, a characteristic of all interjections—whether primary or secondary—is that they can stand alone. For example, it is possible to utter an interjection like &quot;ouch!&quot; or &quot;bloody hell!&quot; on its own, whereas a different part of speech that may seem similar in function and length, such as the conjunction &quot;the&quot;, cannot be uttered alone (you can not just say &quot;the!&quot; independently in English).

Further distinctions can be made based on function. Exclamations and curses are primarily about giving expression to private feelings or emotions, while response particles and hesitation markers are primarily directed at managing the flow of social interaction.

=== Interjections and other word classes ===
Interjections are sometimes classified as particles, a catch-all category that includes adverbs and onomatopoeia. The main thing these word types share is that they can occur on their own and do not easily undergo inflection, but they are otherwise divergent in several ways. A key difference between interjections and onomatopoeia is that interjections are typically &quot;responses to&quot; events, while onomatopoeia can be seen as &quot;imitations of&quot; events.

Interjections can also be confused with adverbs when they appear following a form of the verb “go” (as in &quot;he went &#x27;ouch!&#x27;&quot;), which may seem to describe a manner of going (compare: &#x27;he went rapidly&#x27;). However, this is only a superficial similarity, as the verb go in the first example does not describe the action of going somewhere. One way to differentiate between an interjection and adverb in this position is to find the speaker of the item in question. If it is understood that the subject of the utterance also utters the item (as in &quot;ouch!&quot; in the first example), then it cannot be an adverb.

Routines are considered as a form of speech acts that rely on an understood social communicative pattern between the addressee and addressed. This differs from an interjection that is more of a strategic utterance within a speech act that brings attention to the utterance but may or may not also have an intended addressed (directed at an individual or group). In addition, routines generally are multi-word expressions whereas interjections tend to be single utterances.

Under a different use of the term &#x27;particle&#x27;, particles and interjections can be distinctions in that particles cannot be independent utterances and are fully a part of the syntax of the utterance. Interjections, on the other hand, can stand alone and also are always preceded by a pause, separating them from the grammar and syntax of other surrounding utterances.

== Interjections as deictics ==
Interjections are bound by context, meaning that their interpretation is largely dependent on the time and place at which they are uttered. In linguistics, interjections can also be considered a form of deixis. Although their meaning is fixed (e.g., &quot;Wow!&quot; = surprised), there is also a referencing element which is tied to the situation. For example, the use of the interjection &quot;Wow!&quot; necessarily references some relation between the speaker and something that has just caused surprise to the speaker at the moment of the utterance. Without context, the listener would not know the referent of the expression (viz., the source of the surprise). Similarly, the interjection &quot;Ouch!&quot; generally expresses pain, but also requires contextual information for the listener to determine the referent of the expression (viz., the cause of the pain).

While we can often see deictic or indexical elements in expressive interjections, examples of reference are perhaps more clearly illustrated in the use of imperative examples. Volitive interjections such as &quot;Ahem&quot;, &quot;Psst!&quot;, and &quot;Shh!&quot; could be considered imperative, as the speaker is requesting or demanding something from the listener. Similar to the deictic pronoun &quot;you&quot;, the referent of these expressions changes, dependent on the context of the utterance.

==Interjections across languages==
Interjections can take very different forms and meanings across cultures. For instance, the English interjections &quot;gee&quot; and &quot;wow&quot; have no direct equivalent in Polish, and the closest equivalent for Polish &#x27;&quot;fu&#x27;&quot; (an interjection of disgust) is the different sounding &#x27;&quot;Yuck!&quot;&#x27;. Curses likewise are famously language-specific and colourful. On the other hand, interjections that manage social interaction may be more similar across languages. For instance, the word &#x27;&quot;Huh?&quot;&#x27;, used when one has not caught what someone just said, is remarkably similar in 31 spoken languages around the world, prompting claims that it may be a universal word. Similar observations have been made for the interjections &quot;&#x27;Oh!&quot;&#x27; (meaning, roughly, &quot;now I see&quot;) and &#x27;&quot;Mm/m-hm&quot;&#x27; (with the meaning &quot;keep talking, I&#x27;m with you&quot;).

Across languages, interjections often use special sounds and syllable types that are not commonly used in other parts of the vocabulary. For instance, interjections like &#x27;&quot;brr&#x27;&quot; and &#x27;&quot;shh!&quot;&#x27; are made entirely of consonants, where in virtually all languages, words have to feature at least one vowel-like element. Some, like &#x27;&quot;tut-tut&quot;&#x27; and &quot;&#x27;ahem&quot;&#x27;, are written like normal words, but their actual production involves clicks or throat-clearing. The phonetic atypicality of some interjections is one reason they have traditionally been considered as lying outside the realm of language.

==Examples from English==

Several English interjections contain sounds, or are sounds as opposed to words, that do not (or very rarely) exist in regular English phonological inventory. For example:
* &quot;Ahem&quot; , (&quot;Attention!&quot;) may contain a glottal stop or a in any dialect of English; the glottal stop is common in American English, some British dialects, and in other languages, such as German.
* &quot;Gah&quot; , (&quot;Gah, there&#x27;s nothing to do!&quot;) ends with , which does not occur with regular English words.
* &quot;Psst&quot; (&quot;Listen closely!&quot;) is an entirely consonantal syllable, and its consonant cluster does not occur initially in regular English words.
* &quot;Shh&quot; (&quot;Quiet!&quot;) is another entirely consonantal syllable word.
* &quot;Tut-tut&quot; (&quot;Shame on you&quot;), also spelled &quot;tsk-tsk&quot;, is made up entirely of clicks, which are an active part of regular speech in several African languages. This particular click is dental. (This also has the spelling pronunciation .)
* &quot;Ugh&quot; (&quot;Disgusting!&quot;) ends with a velar fricative consonant, which is otherwise restricted to just a few regional dialects of English, though is common in languages like Spanish, German, Gaelic, and Russian.
* &quot;Whew&quot; or &quot;phew&quot; , [] (&quot;What a relief!&quot;), also spelled &quot;shew&quot;, may start with a bilabial fricative, a sound pronounced with a strong puff of air through the lips. This sound is a common phoneme in such languages as Suki (a language of New Guinea) and Ewe and Logba (both spoken in Ghana and Togo).
* &quot;Uh-oh&quot; (&quot;Oh, no!&quot;) contains a glottal stop.
* &quot;Yeah&quot; (&quot;Yes&quot;) ends with the vowel , or in some dialects the short vowel or tensed , none of which are found at the end of any regular English words.

<text>The University of St Andrews (, ; abbreviated as St And in post-nominals) is a public university in St Andrews, Scotland. It is the oldest of the four ancient universities of Scotland and, following the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the third-oldest university in the English-speaking world. St Andrews was founded in 1413 when the Avignon Antipope Benedict XIII issued a papal bull to a small founding group of Augustinian clergy. Along with the universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh, St Andrews was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.

St Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges — United College (a union of St Salvator&#x27;s and St Leonard&#x27;s Colleges), St Mary&#x27;s College, and St Leonard&#x27;s College, the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard&#x27;s as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties. The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two semesters, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town&#x27;s population are either staff members or students of the university. The student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.

The student body is also notably diverse: over 145 nationalities are represented with about 45% of its intake from countries outside the UK; a tenth of students are from Europe with the remainder from the rest of the world—20% from North America alone. Undergraduate admissions are now among the most selective in the country, with the university having the third-lowest offer rate for 2022 entry (behind only Oxford and Cambridge) and the highest entry standards of new students, as measured by UCAS entry tariff, at 212 points.

St Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and politicians. Recent alumni include the former first minister of Scotland Alex Salmond; former Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill; former Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) Alex Younger; Olympic cycling gold medalist Chris Hoy; Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations Dame Barbara Woodward; and royals William, Prince of Wales, and Catherine, Princess of Wales. Five Nobel laureates are among St Andrews&#x27; alumni and former staff: three in Chemistry and two in Physiology or Medicine.

==History==
===Foundation===

In 1410, a group of Augustinian clergy, driven from the University of Paris by the Avignon schism and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, offering courses of lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. A charter of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw, on 28 February 1411–12. Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413. King James I of Scotland confirmed the charter of the university in 1432. Subsequent kings supported the university, with King James V of Scotland &quot;confirming privileges of the university&quot; in 1532.

A college of theology and arts, called St John&#x27;s College, was founded in 1418 by Robert of Montrose and Lawrence of Lindores. St Salvator&#x27;s College was established in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy. St Leonard&#x27;s College was founded in 1511 by Archbishop Alexander Stewart, who intended it to have a far more monastic character than either of the other colleges. St John&#x27;s College was refounded by Cardinal James Beaton under the name St Mary&#x27;s College in 1538 for the study of divinity and law. It was intended to encourage traditional Catholic teachings in opposition to the emerging Scottish Reformation, but once Scotland had formally split with the Papacy in 1560, it became a teaching institution for Protestant clergy. At its foundation in 1538 St Mary&#x27;s was intended to be a college for instruction in divinity, law, and medicine, as well as in Arts, but its career on this extensive scale was short-lived. Under a new foundation and erection, confirmed by Parliament in 1579, it was set apart for the study of Theology, and it has remained a Divinity College ever since.

Some university buildings that date from this period are still in use today, such as St Salvator&#x27;s Chapel, St Leonard&#x27;s College Chapel and St Mary&#x27;s College quadrangle. At this time, the majority of the teaching was of a religious nature and was conducted by clerics associated with St Andrews Cathedral.

===Development===

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the university had mixed fortunes and was often beset by civil and religious disturbances. In a particularly acute depression in 1747, severe financial problems triggered the dissolution of St Leonard&#x27;s College, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator&#x27;s College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard. Throughout this period student numbers were very low; for instance, when Samuel Johnson visited the university in 1773, the university had fewer than 100 students, and was in his opinion in a steady decline. He described it as &quot;pining in decay and struggling for life&quot;. The poverty of Scotland during this period also damaged St Andrews, as few were able to patronise the university and its colleges, and with state support being improbable, the income they received was scarce.

===Modern period===
====Women====

In the second half of the 19th century, the pressure was building upon universities to open up higher education to women. In 1876, the university senate decided to allow women to receive an education at St Andrews at a level roughly equal to the Master of Arts degree that men were able to take at the time. The scheme came to be known as the &#x27;LLA examination&#x27; (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and entitled them to hold a diploma from the university. Not being required to attend the university in person, the women were learning by correspondence, taking as many years as needed to complete the course. They were both examined and assisted in their studies by educationalists in the town or city in which they lived in the UK or abroad.

In 1889, the Universities (Scotland) Act made it possible to admit women to St Andrews formally and to receive an education equal to that of male students. In September 1892, the university was reported as having &quot;lately taken the lead in opening its classes to women&quot; and proclaimed that &quot;St Andrews hails a ladies&#x27; school – St Leonards – second to none in the land, and probably second to few in England&quot;. By 1892, the headmistress of St Leonard&#x27;s Ladies School, Dame Frances Dove, had become &quot;possessor&quot; of the buildings of the university&#x27;s old St Leonard&#x27;s College which were being used again for their original purpose of providing accommodation for students, only this time not for males but for &quot;girl graduates and undergraduates&quot;.

Having matriculated, Agnes Forbes Blackadder entered the university in 1892 and became the first woman to graduate from St Andrews on the same level as men on 29 March 1895, when she gained her MA. The first female lecturer at the university was Alice Marion Umpherston, appointed in 1896 to teach Physiology to women students. In response to the increasing number of female students attending the university, the first women&#x27;s hall of residence was founded in 1896 by Dame Louisa Lumsden, the first principal of St Leonards School, which adjoined the university. The residence was named University Hall.

====Dundee====
Until the start of the 20th century, St Andrews offered a traditional education based on classical languages, divinity and philosophical studies, and was slow to embrace more practical fields such as science and medicine that were becoming more popular at other universities. In response to the need for modernisation and in order to increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the university had, by 1883, established a university college in Dundee which formally merged with St Andrews in 1897. From its inception, the Dundee college had a focus on scientific, and professional subjects; the college&#x27;s mixed sexes read Classics and English at St Andrews. The union was fraught with difficulties; in 1894, &quot;The Educational Times&quot; reported in the article &quot;The Quarrel between St Andrews and Dundee&quot; that University College, Dundee was &quot;forbidden&quot; to give such instruction in the Arts &quot;as he [the Dundeen student] might require&quot;. After the incorporation of University College Dundee, St Andrews&#x27; various problems generally receded. For example, it was able to offer medical degrees. Until 1967, many students who obtained a degree from the University of St Andrews had in fact spent most, and sometimes all, of their undergraduate career based in Dundee.

In 1967, the union with Queen&#x27;s College Dundee (formerly University College Dundee) ended, when it became an independent institution under the name of the University of Dundee. As a result of this, St Andrews lost its capacity to provide degrees in many areas such as Medicine, Dentistry, Law, Accountancy, and Engineering. As well as losing the right to confer the undergraduate medical degree MBChB, it was also deprived of the right to confer the postgraduate degree MD. St Andrews was eventually able to continue to offer the opportunity to study medicine through a new arrangement with the University of Manchester in England.

In 1974, the College of St Leonard was reconstituted as a postgraduate institute.

===Links with the United States===
St Andrews&#x27; historical links with the United States predate the country&#x27;s independence. James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, attended (but did not graduate from) St Andrews. Wilson was one of six original justices appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court of the United States and was a founder of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Other prominent American figures associated with St Andrews include Scottish American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who was elected Rector in 1901 and whose name is given to the prestigious Carnegie Scholarship, and Edward Harkness, an American philanthropist who in 1930 provided for the construction of St Salvator&#x27;s Hall. American Bobby Jones, co-founder of the Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters Tournament, was named a Freeman of the City of St Andrews in 1958, becoming only the second American to be so honoured, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759.

Links with the United States have been maintained into the present day and continue to grow. In 2009, Louise Richardson, an Irish-American political scientist specialising in the study of terrorism, was drawn from Harvard to serve as the first female Principal and Vice Chancellor of St Andrews. She later went on to her next appointment as the vice chancellor to the University of Oxford.

Active recruitment of students from North America first began in 1984, with Americans now making up around 1 in 6 of the student population in 2017. Students from almost every state in the United States and province in Canada are represented. This is the highest proportion and absolute number of American students amongst all British universities. Media reports indicate growing numbers of American students are attracted to the university&#x27;s academics, traditions, prestige, internationalism, and comparatively low tuition fees. The university also regularly features as one of the few non-North American universities in the Fiske Guide to Colleges, an American college guide, as a &#x27;Best Buy&#x27;. St Andrews has developed a sizable alumni presence in the United States, with over 8000 alumni spread across all 50 states. Most major cities host alumni clubs, the largest of which is in New York. Both London and New York also host the St Andrews Angels, an alumni-led angel investment network, which centres upon the wider university communities in both the United Kingdom and United States. St Andrews has also established relationships with other university alumni clubs and private membership clubs in the United States to provide alumni with social and networking opportunities. For example, alumni are eligible for membership at the Princeton Club of New York, the Penn Club of New York City and the Algonquin Club in Boston.

In 2013, Hillary Clinton, former United States Secretary of State, took part in the academic celebration marking the 600th anniversary of the founding of the University of St Andrews. Clinton received an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws and provided the graduation address, in which she said,
==Governance and administration==

As with the other ancient universities of Scotland, the governance of the university is determined by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858. This act created three bodies: the General Council, University Court and Academic Senate (&quot;Senatus Academicus&quot;).

===General Council===

The General Council is a standing advisory body of all the graduates, academics, and former academics of the university. It meets twice a year and appoints a business committee to manage business between these meetings. Its most important functions are to appoint two assessors to the University Court and elect the university&#x27;s chancellor.

===University Court===
The University Court is the body responsible for administrative and financial matters and is in effect the governing body of the university. It is chaired by the rector, who is elected by the matriculated students of the university. Members are appointed by the General Council, Academic Senate and Fife Council. The president of the Students&#x27; Association and director of education are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the court. Several lay members are also co-opted and must include a fixed number of alumni of the university.

===&quot;Senatus Academicus&quot;===
The Academic Senate (Latin &quot;Senatus Academicus&quot;) is the supreme academic body for the university. Its members include all the professors of the university, certain senior readers, a number of senior lecturers and lecturers, and three elected student senate representatives – one from the arts and divinity faculty, one from the science and medicine faculty and one postgraduate student. It is responsible for authorising degree programmes and issuing all degrees to graduates, and managing student discipline. The president of the Senate is the University Principal.

===University officials===

The university&#x27;s three most significant officials are its chancellor, principal, and rector, whose rights and responsibilities are largely derived from the Universities (Scotland) Act 1858.

The Chancellor of the University of St Andrews is the titular head of the University of St Andrews. Their duties include conferring degrees, promoting the university&#x27;s image throughout the world, and furthering the university&#x27;s interests worldwide.

The Principal is the chief executive of the university and is assisted in that role by several key officers, including the deputy principal, Master of the United College and Quaestor. The principal has responsibility for the overall running of the university and presides over the University Senate.

In Scotland, the position of Rector exists at the four ancient universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) – as well as the University of Dundee. The post was made an integral part of these universities by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The rector of the University of St Andrews chairs meetings of the University Court, the governing body of the university; and is elected by the matriculated student body to ensure that their needs are adequately considered by the university&#x27;s leadership. Throughout St Andrews&#x27; history a number of notable people have been elected to the post, including the actor John Cleese, industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, author and poet Rudyard Kipling and the British Prime Minister Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery.
===Colleges===
The university encompasses three colleges: United College, St Mary&#x27;s College and St Leonard&#x27;s College. The purpose of the colleges at St Andrews is mainly ceremonial, as students are housed in separate residential halls or private accommodations. United College is responsible for all students in the faculties of arts, sciences, and medicine, and is based around St Salvator&#x27;s Quadrangle. St Mary&#x27;s College is responsible for all students studying in the Faculty of Divinity, and has its own dedicated site in St Mary&#x27;s Quadrangle. St Leonard&#x27;s College is now responsible for all postgraduate students. In 2022 the university announced its intention to create New College, a fourth college responsible for the school of International Relations and the newly formed Business School, which comprises the departments of Economics, Finance and Management. It will be located at the former site of Madras College in the town&#x27;s centre, and is expected to cost £100 million.

===Faculties and schools===
The four academic faculties collectively encompass 18 schools. A dean is appointed by the Master of the United College to oversee the day-to-day running of each faculty. Students apply to become members of a particular faculty, as opposed to the school within which teaching is based. The faculties and their affiliated schools are:

*Faculty of Arts: art history, classics, economics, English, film studies, history, international relations, management, modern languages, philosophy, social anthropology.
*Faculty of Divinity: divinity.
*Faculty of Medicine: medicine.
*Faculty of Science: biology, chemistry, computer science, geography and geosciences, mathematics, physics and astronomy, psychology and neuroscience.

Certain subjects are offered within both the Faculties of Arts and Sciences, the six subjects are: economics, geography, management, mathematics, psychology, and sustainable development. The content of the subject is the same regardless of the faculty.

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, the University of St Andrews had a total income of £310.8 million (2022/23 – £314.2 million) and total expenditure of £245.4 million (2022/23 – £293.1 million). Key sources of income included £158.7 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £150.7 million), £43.3 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £43.3 million), £40.3 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £46 million), £5.6 million from investment income (2022/23 – £5.5 million) and £8.8 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £9 million).

At year end, St Andrews had endowments of £125.9 million (2023 – £114.9 million) and total net assets of £499.6 million (2023 – £428.1 million). It holds the twelfth-largest endowment and the third-highest alumni participation rate of any university in the UK.

==Academics==
===Semesters===

The academic year at St Andrews is divided into two semesters, Martinmas and Candlemas, named after two of the four Scottish Term and Quarter Days. Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of Saint Martin of Tours, a fourth-century bishop and hermit. Candlemas originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the Purification, or the Presentation of Christ. Martinmas semester runs from early September until mid-December, with examinations taking place just before the Christmas break. There follows an inter-semester period when Martinmas semester business is concluded and preparations are made for the new Candlemas semester, which starts in January and concludes with examinations in April and May. Most Undergraduate graduations are celebrated in mid-June with Postgraduate graduations being celebrated in late November.

===Rankings and reputation===
In the 2022 The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide, St Andrews ranked as the best university in the UK, the first university to ever top Oxford and Cambridge in a British ranking. In the 2023 Guardian University Guide, St Andrews achieved the same feat and ranked first for the first time in the guide&#x27;s history. In the 2024 versions of both The Guardian University Guide and The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide, St Andrews was again ranked first in the United Kingdom. It has been twice named University of the Year by &quot;The Times and Sunday Times&quot;.
In a ranking conducted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009, St Andrews placed fifth in the UK for national reputation behind Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial &amp; LSE. When size is taken into account, St Andrews ranks second in the world out of all small to medium-sized fully comprehensive universities (after Brown University) using metrics from the QS Intelligence Unit in 2015.
The university is ranked 5th in Europe by Times Higher Education in its 2019 Teaching Rankings. The 2021 Research Excellence Framework ranked St Andrews 16th in the UK, and second in Scotland, amongst multi-faculty institutions for the research quality (GPA) of its output profile. St Andrews was ranked ninth overall in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; 10-year (1998–2007) average ranking of British universities based on consistent league table performance, and is one of only three universities to have never left the top 10 in any of the three main domestic league tables since 2008.

According to data released by the Department for Education in 2018, St Andrews was rated as the fifth best university in the UK for increasing male graduate earnings with male graduates seeing a 25% increase in earnings compared to the average graduate, and the ninth best university for females, with female graduates seeing a 15% increase in earnings compared to the average graduate. St Andrews is placed seventh in the UK (1st in Scotland) for the employability of its graduates as chosen by recruiters from the UK&#x27;s major companies. In 2017, St Andrews was named as the university with the joint second highest graduate employment rate of any UK university (along with Warwick), with 97.7 per cent of its graduates in work or further study three and a half years after graduation. An independent report conducted by Swedish investment firm, Skandia found that despite its small undergraduate body, St Andrews is the joint-5th best university in the UK for producing millionaires. A study by &quot;High Fliers&quot; confirmed this by reporting that the university also features in the top 5 of UK universities for producing self-made millionaires. According to a study by the Institute of Employment Research, St Andrews has produced more directors of FTSE 100 companies in proportion to its size than any other educational institution in Britain.

In the 2019 Complete University Guide, 24 out of the 25 subjects offered by St Andrews rank within the top 10 nationally, making St Andrews one of only three multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge and Oxford) in the UK to have over 95% of their subjects in the top 10. The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2017 revealed that 24 of the 26 subjects offered by St Andrews ranked within the top 6 nationally with 10 subjects placing within the top 3 including English, Management, Philosophy, International Relations, Italian, Physics and Astronomy and Classics and Ancient History. The Guardian University Guide 2019 ranked Biosciences, Computer Science, International Relations, Physics and Psychology first in the UK. Earth and Marine Sciences, Economics, English, Management, Mathematics, Philosophy and Theology placed within the top three nationally. In the 2015–16 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, St Andrews is ranked 46th in the world for Social Sciences, 50th in the world for Arts and Humanities and 74th in the world for Life Sciences. The 2014 CWTS Leiden rankings, which &quot;aims to provide highly accurate measurements of the scientific impact of universities&quot;, placed St Andrews 39th in the world, ranking it fifth domestically. The philosophy department is ranked sixth worldwide (3rd in Europe) in the 2020 QS World University Rankings.

===Admissions===

The university receives applications mainly through UCAS and the Common Application with the latest figures showing that there are generally 12 applications per undergraduate place available. According to 2022 UCAS figures, the university had an offer rate of 24.7% for undergraduate applicants – the third lowest amongst higher education institutions (behind only Oxford and Cambridge). The university is one of the most competitive universities to gain admission into, with successful undergraduate entrants holding 212 UCAS points (the equivalent of just under A*A*A*A at A Level) ranking it as the highest amongst higher education institutions in the UK for the 2021 admissions cycle. The standard offer of a place tends to require five best Highers equivalent to AAAAB, three best A-levels equivalent to AAA or a score of at least 38 points on the International Baccalaureate. For 2016–17, the acceptance rate was 8.35% and the offer rate was 22.5% for Scottish/EU applicants where places are capped by the Scottish Government. In 2017, the most competitive courses for Scottish/EU applicants were those within the Schools of International Relations, Management, and Economics and Finance with offer rates of 8.0%, 10.9% and 11.5% respectively. 

The university hosts the most ethnically diverse student population out of all universities in Scotland, with 17.4% of students from an ethnic minority background and has a higher proportion of female than male students with a female ratio of 59.7% in the undergraduate population. Under 40% of the student body is from private schools and the university has one of the smallest percentages of students (13%) from lower income backgrounds, out of all higher education institutions in the UK. According to data from UCAS, St Andrews&#x27; offer rate to students from the most deprived areas (as measured by SIMD20) has increased from 28% in 2010 to 72.1% for entry in 2022, almost three times higher than the university&#x27;s overall offer rate for all students. The university participates in widening access schemes such as the Sutton Trust Summer School, First Chances Programme, REACH &amp; SWAP Scotland, and Access for Rural Communities (ARC) in order to promote a more widespread uptake of those traditionally under-represented at university. In the seven-year period between 2008 and 2015, the number of pupils engaged with annual outreach programmes at the university has increased by about tenfold whilst the number of students arriving at St Andrews from the most deprived backgrounds has increased by almost 50 per cent in the past year of 2015.

===Lecture series===

To commemorate the university&#x27;s 600th anniversary the &quot;600th Lecture Series&quot; was commissioned in 2011, which brought diverse speakers such as former prime minister Gordon Brown, naturalist David Attenborough and linguist Noam Chomsky to St Andrews.

As part of the celebration of the 400th establishment of the King James Library, the &quot;King James Library lectures&quot; were initiated in 2009 on the subject of &#x27;The Meaning of the Library&#x27;.

The Andrew Lang Lecture series was initiated in 1927, and named for alumnus and poet Andrew Lang. The most famous lecture in this series is that given by J. R. R. Tolkien in March 1939, entitled &#x27;Fairy Stories&#x27;, but published subsequently as &#x27;On Fairy-Stories&#x27;.

The computing &quot;Distinguished Lecture Series&quot; was initiated in 1969 by Jack Cole.

===Exchange programmes===
St Andrews has developed student exchange partnerships with universities around the globe, though offerings are largely concentrated in North America, Europe, and Asia. Exchange opportunities vary by School and eligibility requirements are specific to each exchange program.

In North America, the highly competitive Bachelor of Arts International Honours program, run in conjunction with the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, allows students studying Classical Studies, Film Studies, International Relations, English, History, or Economics to spend two years at each institution and earn a joint degree from both. The Robert T. Jones Memorial Trust funds the Robert T. Jones Jr. Scholarship, which allows selecting St Andrews students to study, fully funded, for a year at Emory University in Atlanta, and Western University and Queen&#x27;s University in Canada. The Robert Lincoln McNeil Scholarship allows students to study at the University of Pennsylvania.

One of the largest North American exchanges is with the University of California system, in which students can study at UC Berkeley, UC Los Angeles (UCLA), UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) and UC San Diego (UCSD).

Other North American partners offering multiple exchanges include the University of Virginia, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Washington University in St. Louis, Washington and Lee University, Elon University, and the University of Toronto. Some exchanges are offered within specific research institutes at St Andrews, rather than across entire Schools. For example, the Handa Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV), within the School of International Relations, offers student exchanges in partnership with the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.

St Andrews participates in the Erasmus Programme and has direct exchanges with universities across Europe. For example, in France exchanges are offered at the Sorbonne, Sciences Po, and University of Paris VI. In the Netherlands, students can study at Leiden University and Utrecht University. Narrower exchanges include those with the University of Copenhagen, the University of Oslo, and Trinity College Dublin. Exchanges are also available for postgraduate research students, such as the opportunity for social scientists to study at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy.

More recently, St Andrews has developed exchanges with partners in Asia and Oceania. Notable partners include the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and National University of Singapore in Asia; the University of Auckland, Australian National University and the University of Melbourne in Oceania.

==Buildings, collections and facilities==

The University of St Andrews is situated in the small town of St Andrews in rural Fife, Scotland. The university has teaching facilities, libraries, student housing and other buildings spread throughout the town. Generally, university departments and buildings are concentrated on North Street, South Street, The Scores, and the North Haugh. The university has two major sites within the town. The first is the United College, St Andrews (also known as the Quad or St Salvator&#x27;s) on North Street, which functions both as a teaching space and venue for student events, incorporating the Departments of Social Anthropology and Modern Languages. The second is St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews, based on South Street, which houses the Schools of Divinity, Psychology and Neuroscience, as well as the King James Library. Several schools are located on The Scores including Classics, English, History, Philosophy, the School of Economics and Finance, and International Relations, as well as the Admissions department, the Museum of the University of St Andrews, and the principal&#x27;s residence, University House. North Street is also the site of several departments, including the principal&#x27;s office, Younger Hall, the Department of Film Studies, and the University Library. The North Haugh is principally home to the Natural Sciences such as Chemistry, Physics, and Biology, as well as Mathematics, Computer Science, Medicine, and the School of Management.

===Libraries and museums===
The University of St Andrews maintains one of the most extensive university library collections in the United Kingdom, which includes significant holdings of books, manuscripts, muniments, and photographs. The library collection contains over a million volumes and over two hundred thousand rare and antique books.

The university library was founded by King James VI in 1612, with the donation of 350 works from the royal collection, at the urging of George Gledstanes, the then chancellor of St Andrews, although the libraries of the colleges of St Leonard&#x27;s College, St Salvator&#x27;s College and St Mary&#x27;s College had existed prior to this. From 1710 to 1837 the library functioned as a legal deposit library, and as a result has an extensive collection of 18th-century literature.
The library&#x27;s main building is located on North Street, and houses over 1,000,000 books. The library was designed by the architects Faulkner-Brown Hendy Watkinson Stonor based in North East England at Killingworth. Faulkner-Brown specialised in libraries and leisure facilities and also designed the National Library of Canada in Ottawa and the Robinson Library at Newcastle University In 2011 the main library building underwent a £7 million re-development. The historic King James library, built in 1643, houses the university&#x27;s Divinity and Medieval history collections.

In 2012 the university purchased the vacant Martyrs&#x27; Kirk on North Street, with the purpose of providing reading rooms for the Special Collections department and university postgraduate research students and staff.

The university maintains several museums and galleries, open free to the public. The Museum of the University of St Andrews (MUSA) opened in 2008 and displays some highlights of the university&#x27;s extensive collection of over 100,000 artefacts. It displays objects relating both to the history of the university, such as its collection of 15th-century maces, and also unrelated objects, such as paintings by John Opie, Alberto Morrocco and Charles Sims. Several of the university&#x27;s collections have been recognised as being of &#x27;national significance for Scotland&#x27; by Museums Galleries Scotland.

The Bell Pettigrew Museum houses the university&#x27;s natural history collections. Founded in 1912, it is housed in the old Bute Medical School Building in St. Mary&#x27;s Quad. Among its collections are the remains of several extinct species such as the dodo and Tasmanian tiger as well as fossilised fish from the nearby Dura Den, Fife, which when found in 1859 stimulated the debate on evolution.
===Chapels===

The university has two collegiate chapels. The chapel of St Salvator&#x27;s was founded in 1450 by Bishop James Kennedy, and today it is a centre of university life. St Salvator&#x27;s has a full peal of six bells, and is therefore the only university chapel in Scotland suitable for change ringing. The Chapel of St Leonard&#x27;s is located in the grounds of the nearby St Leonards School. It is the university&#x27;s oldest building, with some parts dating from 1144 and is the smaller of the two chapels. St Salvator&#x27;s and St Leonard&#x27;s both have their own choirs, whose members are drawn from the student body.

===Student halls===
St Andrews is characterised amongst Scottish universities as having a significant number of students who live in university-maintained accommodation. As of 2012, 52% of the student population lives in university halls. The halls vary widely in age and character; the oldest, Deans Court dates from the 12th century, and the newest, Whitehorn Hall, built in 2018. They are built in styles from Gothic revival to brutalist. All are now co-educational and non-smoking, and several are catered. The university guarantees every first-year student a place of accommodation, and many students return to halls in their second, third and final years at St Andrews. From September 2015 onward, students have had the option of living in alcohol-free flats in David Russell Apartments on the grounds of medical conditions that do not allow drinking or for religious reasons.

Halls of residence include:

* Agnes Blackadder Hall
* Albany Park (demolished 2019–2021)
* Andrew Melville Hall
* David Russell Apartments
* Fife Park Apartments
* Gannochy House
* Hamilton Hall (Sold in 2006)
* John Burnet Hall
* McIntosh Hall
* Powell Hall (Postgraduate only)
* St Regulus Hall
* St Salvator&#x27;s Hall
* University Hall
* Whitehorn Hall (addition to University Hall, 2018)
* Angus and Stanley Smith Houses (Postgraduate only)
* Deans Court (Postgraduate only)
* St Gregory&#x27;s (Postgraduate only)
* Gregory Place (Postgraduate only)

===Renewable energy projects===
Since 2013, the university&#x27;s endowment has been invested under the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment (UNPRI) initiative with a sustainable ethical policy enforced since 2007. The university also funds and administers the international St Andrews Prize for the Environment established in 1998, which awards $150,000 annually to three environmental projects around the globe. The university has the target of being the UK&#x27;s first carbon net zero university by 2035 and has invested in a biomass centre as well as solar and wind farms. It has spent £70 million on the Eden Campus and requires further funding of £100 million to complete works.

The Guardbridge Biomass Energy Centre will generate power using locally sourced wood-fuelled biomass, and hot water will be transported to the university through underground pipes to heat and cool laboratories and student residences. The £25 million project is expected to save 10,000 tonnes of carbon annually and the university aims to establish the site as a knowledge exchange hub which would provide &quot;missing link&quot; facilities to allow research and discoveries made in university labs to be translated to working prototypes. The biomass centre became operational in December 2016 and won the Scottish Green Energy Award in 2023.

In October 2013, the university received permission to build six medium-sized turbines at Kenly Wind Farm, near Boarhills. The wind farms were expected to be operational by 2017 and bring an estimated £22 million boost to the local and national economy saving 19,000 tonnes of carbon annually. However, due to concerns raised by the Ministry of Defence over its proximity to Leuchars Station, as of 2021, the project has been halted.

==Student life==
===Students&#x27; Association===

The University of St Andrews Students&#x27; Association is the organisation that represents the student body of the University of St Andrews.
It was founded in 1885 and comprises the students&#x27; representative council (SRC) and the Student Activities Forum (SAF) (previously known as the Students&#x27; Services Council (SSC)). The Students&#x27; Association has 10 SRC subcommittees and 11 SAF subcommittees: SRC: Accommodation, Alumni, BAME Students&#x27; Network, Community Relations (ComRels), Disabled Students Network (DSN), Environment, Equal Opportunities (EqualOps), Life Long and Flexible Learners (Lifers), SaintsLGBT+, and Wellbeing. SAF: The Entertainments &#x27;Ents&#x27; Committee, Charities Campaign, Union Debating Society, STAR (St Andrews Radio), Mermaids Performing Arts Fund, Design Team, SVS (Student Voluntary Service), the Music Fund (prev. Music is Love), On the Rocks (an annual arts festival), Societies Committee, and the Postgraduate Society. Every matriculated student is automatically a member of each subcommittee.

The Students&#x27; Association Building (informally known as &quot;the Union&quot;) is located on St Mary&#x27;s Place, St Andrews. Facilities include three bars (Main, Beacon, and Sandy&#x27;s) and the university&#x27;s Student Support Services. In 2013 the Students&#x27; Association Building underwent a refurbishment. The Students&#x27; Association is affiliated to, and a founding member of, the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland but unlike many other students&#x27; unions in the UK is not a member of the National Union of Students, having most recently rejected membership in a referendum in November 2012.

===Societies===

St Andrews is home to over 200 student societies which cover a wide range of interests.

The oldest student society in St Andrews is the University of St Andrews Celtic Society, which has run continuously without mergers since 1796. It promotes Scottish culture to students of the university and the wider community. Currently, it does this through Scottish Country Dance and Scottish Gaelic Language Classes. Its Scottish Country Dance activities are affiliated with the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society (RSCDS).

All matriculated students are members of the &quot;Union Debating Society&quot;, a student debating society that holds weekly public debates in Lower Parliament Hall, often hosts notable speakers, and participates in competitive debating in both national and international competitions. Its origins go back to the 1794 founding of the Literary Society. However its current form only dates back to the 1890 merger with the Classical Society. Since its roots can be traced back to 1794, it claims to be the oldest continuously run student debating society in the world.

There is a strong tradition of student media at St Andrews. The university&#x27;s two newspapers are &quot;The Saint&quot;, a fortnightly publication, and &quot;The Stand&quot;, an online publication founded in 2011. There is also the &quot;Foreign Affairs Review&quot; ran by the Foreign Affairs Society and the first legal publication in town – the &quot;St Andrews Law Review -&quot; was launched in 2020. There are also a number of smaller student publications including &quot;The Wynd&quot;, a student-run magazine, &quot;ST.ART&quot;, a student-run arts magazine founded in 2011 and &quot;The Regulus&quot;, a student magazine focusing on politics and current affairs. In addition to this there are several student-led academic journals, most notably, &quot;Stereoscope Magazine&quot; which is focused on student photography and raising awareness of the university&#x27;s historic photographic collection, &quot;Ha@sta&quot;, an annual journal for those interested in art history, &quot;Aporia&quot;, the journal of the Philosophy Society, and the &quot;Postgraduate Journal of Art History and Museum Studies&quot;. The university&#x27;s radio station is &quot;STAR: St Andrews Radio&quot;, an online station that broadcasts 24/7 during term time. &quot;Scoot Around&quot; is a literary-cultural magazine based in St Andrews with contributors from universities around the world.&quot;The Sinner&quot; is an independent website and discussion forum set up by students of the university.
The university&#x27;s Music Society comprises many student-run musical groups, including the university&#x27;s flagship symphony orchestra, wind band, and chorus. One of the oldest choirs in the university is the St Andrews University Madrigal Group, which performs a concert each term and has an annual summer tour. The A Cappella Society represents all four a cappella groups at St Andrews: The Other Guys, The Alleycats, The Accidentals and The Hummingbirds. From 2009 to 2011, all four of these groups participated in The Voice Festival UK(VF-UK) competition, and The Other Guys, The Accidentals, and The Alleycats all reached the London final.

Student theatre at the University of St Andrews is funded by the Mermaids Performing Arts fund. There are regular dramatic and comedic performances staged at the Barron at the Byre Theatre and the Union StAge. Blind Mirth is the university&#x27;s improvisational theatre troupe, which performs weekly in the town, and annually takes a production to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

The Kate Kennedy Club plays a significant role in the life of the university, maintaining university traditions such as the Kate Kennedy Procession, in which students parade through the town dressed as eminent figures from the university&#x27;s history, and organising social events such as the Opening and May balls. Founded in 1926, the club is composed of around thirty matriculated students, who are selected by the club&#x27;s members. The club has received criticism from the university&#x27;s former principal, Louise Richardson, and alumna the Duchess of Rothesay, over its previously male-only admission policy. In 2012, the club decided to allow female students to join.

St Andrews is home to several other private clubs, such as The Kensington Club, founded in 1739 by Alexander Laird Balgonie and is an all-male dining club that organises private events for members. The St Andrews Fight Club hosts an annual boxing match, training 20 amateur boxers in an intensive course.

===Sports clubs and the Athletic Union===
The University of St Andrews Athletic Union is the student representative body for sport. Established in 1901, it is affiliated to BUCS and encompasses around sixty sports clubs, who compete at both a recreational and high-performance level. A notable club is the University of St Andrews Rugby Football Club, which played a pivotal role in shaping the sport and has produced Scottish international players such as J. S. Thomson and Alfred Clunies-Ross.

In 2015, the university underwent a £14 million five-phase development of the student sports centre which included a new 400-seat eight-court sports hall, a new reception area and expanded gym facilities.

The Scottish Varsity, also known as the &#x27;world&#x27;s oldest varsity match&#x27;, is played annually against the University of Edinburgh.

==Traditions==
===&quot;Sponsio Academica&quot;===
In order to become a student at the university a person must take an oath in Latin at the point of matriculation, called the &quot;Sponsio Academica&quot;, although this tradition now has been digitised and is agreed to as part of an online matriculation process.

In English:

We students who set down our names hereunder in all good faith make a solemn promise that we shall show due deference to our teachers in all matters relating to order and good conduct, that we shall be subject to the authority of the Senatus Academicus and shall, whatever be the position we attain hereafter, promote, so far as lies in our power, the profit and the interest in our University of St Andrews. Further, we recognise that, if any of us conducts ourselves in an unbecoming or disorderly manner or shows insufficient diligence in their studies and, though admonished, does not improve, it is within the power of the Senatus Academicus to inflict on such students a fitting penalty or even expel them from the University.

=== University blessing and grace ===
Peter Redford Scott Lang reintroduced a tradition of praying the grace before and after meals when he brought back student common dinners in 1887. According to Lang, the use of Latin graces at student meals had disappeared by the time of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s visit to St Andrews in 1773. Johnson was astonished that the grace was not recited in Latin, and it was requested that he write a Latin grace for the university. Common meals at the university ceased in 1820 and so did the grace with them. Lang wrote that he learned of the grace from George Edward Day, who himself learned it from an elder retired professor while visiting Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson. At dinner, the retired professor recited a short grace, explaining that Johnson&#x27;s grace was so long that the president could not remember it except for one sentence: &quot;Sit nomen domini benedictum&quot; (blessed be the name of the Lord). The shorter grace became the standard until common dinners ceased to occur. Reinstituting common student dinners in 1887, Lang reintroduced the university blessing and university grace.

Due to the story of the composition of the graces by Samuel Johnson, there has previously been a belief that the University of St Andrews&#x27; graces derived from Johnson&#x27;s alma mater, Pembroke College, Oxford. According to a historian of the University of St Andrews, Ronald Gordon Cant, the current graces and the music settings composed for them &quot;although based on traditional forms, these forms had no specific connection with earlier St Andrews usage, and bear no resemblance whatsoever to the old Pembroke grace&quot;. Thus, Cant states that the current graces &quot;were specially composed for the Common Dinners instituted in 1887&quot;.

University Blessing:&quot;Sit nomen Domini Benedictum per Jesum Christum salvatorem nostrum. Amen.&quot;

(Blessed be the name of the Lord through Jesus Christ, our Saviour. Amen.)University Grace:

Before Meat:&quot;Gloria Patri Filio Spirituique Sancto In Saecula Saeculorum. Amen.&quot;

(Glory be to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. World Without End. Amen.)After Meat:&quot;Deo Gratias.&quot;

(Thanks be to God.)

===Gowns===
One of the most conspicuous traditions at St Andrews is the wearing of academic dress, particularly the distinctive red undergraduate gown of the United College. Undergraduates in Arts and Science subjects can be seen wearing these garments at the installation of a rector or chancellor, at chapel services, on &#x27;Pier Walks&#x27;, at formal hall dinners, at meetings of the Union Debating Society, and giving tours to prospective students and visitors as well as on St Andrews Day. Divinity students wear a black undergraduate gown with a purple saltire cross on the left facing. Postgraduates wear the graduate gown or, as members of St Leonard College, may wear a black gown trimmed with burgundy, introduced for graduate students whose original university is without academic dress. (See Academic dress of the University of St Andrews.) St Mary&#x27;s College Post Graduates, however, wear their graduate gown with a purple saltire cross on the left facing.

===Bejant===
Bejant (Bejan) is a French term (bec jaune) meaning yellow beak or nestling, borrowed from the university of Paris and used to refer to first-year male students; females being described as Bejantines. Second-year students are known as a Semis, a student in their third year may be referred to as a Tertian, and in their final year as a Magistrand. These terms are thought to be unique to St Andrews. When wearing their traditional red gowns, students in each year may be identified according to the way they wear their gowns. In the first year, the gown is worn on the shoulders, in the second year it is worn slightly off the shoulders. In the third year, arts students wear their gowns off their left shoulders, and science students off their right shoulders. Finally, fourth-years wear their gowns right down to their elbows, ready to shed their scarlet gowns for the black graduation gown. The gown is never to be joined at the top as this is considered bad luck.

===Academic parents===
The students of the university enjoy an unusual &quot;family tradition&quot; designed to make new students feel at home and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students, who informally guide and mentor them in academic and social matters in their time at the university. it is not rare for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his &quot;Senior Man&quot; but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his &quot;Senior Woman&quot;. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt &quot;rule&quot; regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.

===Raisin Weekend===

Raisin Weekend celebrates the relationship between the Bejants/ Bejantines (first-year students) and their respective academic parents. It is traditionally said that students went up to study with a sack of oatmeal and a barrel of salt-herring as staple foods to last them a term and that, therefore, anything more exotic was seen as a luxury. In return for the guidance from academic parents, a further tradition sprang up of rewarding these &quot;parents&quot; with a pound of raisins. Since the 19th century, the giving of raisins was steadily transformed into the giving of a more modern alternative, such as a bottle of wine (although presents are now rarely expected). In return for the raisins or equivalent present, the parents give their &quot;children&quot; a formal receipt — the &quot;Raisin Receipt&quot; — composed in Latin. Over time this receipt progressively became more elaborate and often humorous. The receipt can be written on anything and is to be carried everywhere by the Bejant/Bejantine on the morning of Raisin Monday until midday.

Raisin Weekend is held annually over the last weekend of October. Affairs often begin with a tea party (or similar) thrown by the mother(s) and then a pub crawl or house party led by the father(s). It is fairly common for several academic families to combine in the latter stages of the revels. At midday all the First-Years gather in Quad of St Salvator&#x27;s College to compare their receipts and also to be open to challenge from older students who may look for errors in the Latin of the receipt (an almost inevitable occurrence). Upon detection of such error(s) the bearer may be required to sing the Gaudie. In more recent years the gathering has culminated in a shaving foam fight. Since 2014, the foam fight has been moved from St Salvator&#x27;s Quad to the adjacent Lower College Lawn. Raisin Weekend has also become synonymous with binge drinking and a certain amount of humiliation of &quot;academic children&quot;, commonly involving embarrassing costumes or drinking games. The University Students&#x27; Association provides a special First Aid hotline for Raisin Weekend.

===The Curse of Patrick Hamilton===
Situated around the town of St Andrews are cobblestone markings denoting where Protestant martyrs were burnt at the stake. To students, the most notable of these is the cobblestone initials &quot;PH&quot; located outside the main gate of St Salvator&#x27;s College. These cobblestones denote where Patrick Hamilton was martyred in 1528. According to student tradition, stepping on the &quot;PH&quot; will cause a student to become cursed, with the effect that the offender will fail his or her degree and so students are known to jump over the cobblestones when passing. The &#x27;curse&#x27; is said to be lifted by participating in the May Dip.
===May Dip===
The May Dip is a student tradition held annually at dawn on May Day. Students usually stay awake until dawn, at which time they collectively run into the North Sea to the sound of madrigals sung by the University Madrigal Group. Students purportedly do so to cleanse themselves of any academic sins (which they may have acquired by stepping on the PH cobblestone) before they sit exams in May. In 2011, the event was &quot;officially&quot; moved by the Students&#x27; Association to East Sands in response to concerns for health and safety in its former location on Castle Sands.

==Publications==
The Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV), within the School of International Relations, publishes the online open-access journal &quot;Contemporary Voices: St Andrews Journal of International Relations&quot; (formerly &quot;Journal of Terrorism Research&quot;).

<text>Gene Eliza Tierney (November 19, 1920 – November 6, 1991) was an American film and stage actress. Acclaimed for her great beauty, she became established as a leading lady. She was best known for her portrayal of the title character in the film &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Ellen Berent Harland in &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945).

Tierney&#x27;s other roles include Martha Strable Van Cleve in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943), Isabel Bradley Maturin in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1946), Lucy Muir in &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947), Ann Sutton in &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1949), Mary Bristol in &quot;Night and the City&quot; (1950), Maggie Carleton McNulty in &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1951), and Anne Scott in &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot; (1955).

==Early life==
Gene Eliza Tierney was born on November 19, 1920, in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Howard Sherwood Tierney and Belle Lavinia Taylor. She was named after a beloved uncle, who died young. She had an elder brother, Howard Sherwood &quot;Butch&quot; Tierney Jr., and a younger sister, Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; Tierney. Her father was a successful insurance broker of Irish descent on his paternal side; their mother was a former physical education instructor.

Tierney spent two years in Europe, attending Brillantmont International School in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she learned to speak fluent French. She returned to the US in 1936 and attended Miss Porter&#x27;s School in Farmington, Connecticut. On a family trip to the West Coast, she visited Warner Bros. studios, where her mother&#x27;s cousin – Gordon Hollingshead – worked as a producer of historical short films. Director Anatole Litvak, taken by the 17-year-old&#x27;s beauty, told Tierney that she should become an actress. Warner Bros. wanted to sign her to a contract, but her parents advised against it because of the relatively low salary; they also wanted her to take her position in society.

Tierney&#x27;s society debut occurred on September 24, 1938, when she was 17 years old. Soon bored with society life, she decided to pursue an acting career. Her father said, &quot;If Gene is to be an actress, it should be in the legitimate theatre.&quot; Tierney studied acting at a small Greenwich Village acting studio in New York with Yiddish Broadway actor/director Benno Schneider. She became a &quot;protégée&quot; of Broadway producer-director George Abbott.

==Career==
===Broadway===
In Tierney&#x27;s first role on Broadway, she carried a bucket of water across the stage in &quot;What a Life!&quot; (1938). A &quot;Variety&quot; magazine critic declared, &quot;Miss Tierney is certainly the most beautiful water carrier I&#x27;ve ever seen!&quot; She also worked as an understudy in &quot;The Primrose Path&quot; (1938).

The following year, she appeared in the role of Molly O&#x27;Day in the Broadway production &quot;Mrs. O&#x27;Brien Entertains&quot; (1939). &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, &quot;As an Irish maiden fresh from the old country, Gene Tierney in her first stage performance is very pretty and refreshingly modest.&quot; That same year, Tierney appeared as Peggy Carr in &quot;Ring Two&quot; (1939) to favorable reviews. Theater critic Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;I see no reason why Miss Tierney should not have an interesting theatrical career – that is, if cinema does not kidnap her away.&quot;

Tierney&#x27;s father set up a corporation, Belle-Tier, to fund and promote her acting career. Columbia Pictures signed her to a six-month contract in 1939. She met Howard Hughes, who tried unsuccessfully to seduce her. From a well-to-do family herself, she was not impressed by his wealth. Hughes eventually became a lifelong friend. 

After a cameraman advised Tierney to lose a little weight, she wrote to &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; magazine for a diet, which she followed for the next 25 years. Tierney was initially offered the lead role in &quot;National Velvet,&quot; but production was delayed. When Columbia Pictures failed to find Tierney a project, she returned to Broadway and starred as Patricia Stanley to critical and commercial success in &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1940). In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson wrote, &quot;Tierney blazes with animation in the best performance she has yet given&quot;. She was the toast of Broadway before her 20th birthday. &quot;The Male Animal&quot; was a hit, and Tierney was featured in &quot;Life&quot;. She was also photographed by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, and &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

Two weeks after &quot;The Male Animal&quot; opened, Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, was rumored to have been in the audience. During the performance, he told an assistant to note Tierney&#x27;s name. Later that night, Zanuck dropped by the Stork Club, where he saw a young lady on the dance floor. He told his assistant, &quot;Forget the girl from the play. See if you can sign that one.&quot; She was Tierney. At first, Zanuck did not think she was the actress he had seen. Tierney was quoted (after the fact), saying: &quot;I always had several different &#x27;looks&#x27;, a quality that proved useful in my career.&quot;

===Film career===
Tierney signed with 20th Century-Fox and her motion picture debut was in a supporting role as Eleanor Stone in Fritz Lang&#x27;s Western &quot;The Return of Frank James&quot; (1940), opposite Henry Fonda.

A small role as Barbara Hall followed in &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Bay&quot; (1941) with Paul Muni and she co-starred as Ellie Mae Lester in John Ford&#x27;s comedy &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (also 1941), and played the title role in &quot;Belle Starr&quot; alongside co-star Randolph Scott, Zia in &quot;Sundown&quot;, and Victoria Charteris (Poppy Smith) in &quot;The Shanghai Gesture&quot;. She played Eve in &quot;Son of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake&quot; (1942), as well as the dual role of Susan Miller (Linda Worthington) in Rouben Mamoulian&#x27;s screwball comedy &quot;Rings on Her Fingers&quot;, and roles as Kay Saunders in &quot;Thunder Birds,&quot; and Miss Young in &quot;China Girl&quot; (all 1942).

Receiving top billing in Ernst Lubitsch&#x27;s comedy &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1943), as Martha Strable Van Cleve, signaled an upward turn in Tierney&#x27;s career. Tierney recalled during the production of &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;:

Lubitsch was a tyrant on the set, the most demanding of directors. After one scene, which took from noon until five to get, I was almost in tears from listening to Lubitsch shout at me. The next day I sought him out, looked him in the eye, and said, &#x27;Mr. Lubitsch, I&#x27;m willing to do my best but I just can&#x27;t go on working on this picture if you&#x27;re going to keep shouting at me.&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m paid to shout at you&#x27;, he bellowed. &#x27;Yes&#x27;, I said, &#x27;and I&#x27;m paid to take it – but not enough.&#x27; After a tense pause, Lubitsch broke out laughing. From then on we got along famously.

Tierney starred in what became her best-remembered role: the title role in Otto Preminger&#x27;s film noir &quot;Laura&quot; (1944), opposite Dana Andrews (with whom she would work again in &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot; and Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Where The Sidewalk Ends&quot;). After playing Tina Tomasino in &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot; (1945), she played the jealous, narcissistic &quot;femme fatale&quot; Ellen Berent Harland in &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), adapted from a bestselling novel by Ben Ames Williams. Appearing with Cornel Wilde, Tierney won an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. This was 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s most successful film of the 1940s. It was cited by director Martin Scorsese as one of his favorite films, and he assessed Tierney as one of the most underrated actresses of the Golden Era.

Tierney starred as Miranda Wells in &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946), along with Walter Huston and Vincent Price. It was Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27; debut film as a director. In the same period, she starred as Isabel Bradley, opposite Tyrone Power, in &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (also 1946), an adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham&#x27;s novel of the same name. Her performance was critically praised.

Tierney played Lucy Muir in Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (1947), opposite Rex Harrison. The following year, she co-starred again with Power, this time as Sara Farley in the successful screwball comedy &quot;That Wonderful Urge&quot; (1948). As the decade came to a close, Tierney reunited with &quot;Laura&quot; director Preminger to star as Ann Sutton in the classic film noir &quot;Whirlpool&quot; (1950), co-starring Richard Conte and José Ferrer. She appeared in two other films noir: Jules Dassin&#x27;s &quot;Night and the City&quot;, shot in London, and Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot; (both 1950), reunited with both Preminger and leading man Dana Andrews, with whom she appeared in five movies total including &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot; and, before &quot;Laura&quot;, &quot;Belle Starr&quot; and &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;.

Tierney was lent to Paramount Pictures, giving a comic turn as Maggie Carleton in Mitchell Leisen&#x27;s ensemble farce, &quot;The Mating Season&quot; (1951), with John Lund, Thelma Ritter, and Miriam Hopkins. She gave a tender performance as Midge Sheridan in the Warner Bros. film, &quot;Close to My Heart&quot; (1951), with Ray Milland. The film is about a couple trying to adopt a child. Later in her career, she was reunited with Milland in &quot;Daughter of the Mind&quot; (1969).

After Tierney appeared opposite Rory Calhoun as Teresa in &quot;Way of a Gaucho&quot; (1952), her contract at 20th Century-Fox expired. That same year, she starred as Dorothy Bradford in &quot;Plymouth Adventure&quot;, opposite Spencer Tracy at MGM. Tracy and she had a brief affair during this time. Tierney played Marya Lamarkina opposite Clark Gable in &quot;Never Let Me Go&quot; (1953), filmed in England.

In the course of the 1940s, she reached a pinnacle of fame as a beautiful leading lady, on a par with &quot;fellow sirens Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner and Ava Gardner&quot;. She was called “the most beautiful woman in movie history&quot; and many of her movies in the 1940s became classic films.

Tierney remained in Europe to play Kay Barlow in United Artists&#x27; &quot;Personal Affair&quot; (1953). While in Europe, she began a romance with Prince Aly Khan, but their marriage plans met with fierce opposition from his father Aga Khan III. Early in 1953, Tierney returned to the U.S. to co-star in the film noir &quot;Black Widow&quot; (1954) as Iris Denver, with Ginger Rogers and Van Heflin.

===Health===
Tierney had reportedly started smoking after a screening of her first movie to lower her voice, because she felt that she sounded &quot;like an angry Minnie Mouse.&quot; She subsequently became a heavy smoker.
Tierney struggled for years with episodes of manic depression. In 1943, she gave birth to a daughter, Daria, who was deaf and mentally disabled due to congenital rubella syndrome. In 1953, she suffered problems with concentration, which affected her film appearances. She dropped out of &quot;Mogambo&quot; and was replaced by Grace Kelly. While playing Anne Scott in &quot;The Left Hand of God&quot; (1955), opposite Humphrey Bogart, Tierney became ill. Bogart&#x27;s sister Frances (known as Pat) had suffered from mental illness, so he showed Tierney great sympathy, feeding her lines during the production and encouraging her to seek help.

Tierney consulted a psychiatrist and was admitted to Harkness Pavilion in New York. Later, she went to the Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. After some 27 shock treatments, intended to alleviate severe depression, Tierney fled the facility, but was caught and returned. She later became an outspoken opponent of shock treatment therapy, claiming it had destroyed significant portions of her memory.

In late December 1957, Tierney, from her mother&#x27;s apartment in Manhattan, stepped onto a ledge 14 stories above ground and remained for about 20 minutes in what was considered a suicide attempt. Police were called, and afterwards, Tierney&#x27;s family arranged for her to be admitted to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas. The following year, after treatment for depression, she was discharged. Afterwards, she worked as a sales girl in a local dress shop with hopes of integrating back into society. A Topeka newspaper reported on her employment status, which gained national attention.

Later in 1958, 20th Century Fox offered Tierney a lead role in &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (1959), but the stress upon her proved too great, so only days into production, she dropped out of the film and returned to Menninger for a time.

===Comeback===
Tierney made a screen comeback in &quot;Advise and Consent&quot; (1962), co-starring with Franchot Tone and reuniting with director Otto Preminger. Soon afterwards, she played Albertine Prine in &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1963), based on the play by Lillian Hellman. This was followed by the international production of &quot;Las Cuatro Noches de la Luna Llena&quot; (&quot;Four Nights of the Full Moon&quot; – 1963), in which she starred with Dan Dailey. She received critical praise overall for her performances.

Tierney&#x27;s career as a solid character actress seemed to be back on track as she played Jane Barton in &quot;The Pleasure Seekers&quot; (1964), but then she suddenly retired. She returned to star in the television movie &quot;Daughter of the Mind&quot; (1969) with Don Murray and Ray Milland. Her final performance was in the TV miniseries &quot;Scruples&quot; (1980).

==Personal life==
Tierney was married twice. Her first husband was Oleg Cassini, a costume and fashion designer, with whom she eloped on June 1, 1941. She was 20 years old, and Cassini was 28. Her parents opposed the marriage because he was from a Russian-Italian family, born in France. She and Cassini had two daughters, Antoinette Daria Cassini (October 15, 1943 – September 11, 2010) and Christina &quot;Tina&quot; Cassini (November 19, 1948 – March 31, 2015).

In June 1943, while pregnant with Daria, Tierney contracted rubella (German measles), likely from a fan ill with the disease. Antoinette Daria Cassini was born prematurely in Washington, DC, weighing and requiring a total blood transfusion. The rubella caused congenital damage: Daria was deaf, partially blind with cataracts, and severely mentally disabled. She was institutionalized for much of her life. This entire incident was inspiration for the plot in the 1962 Agatha Christie novel &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot;. (Christie&#x27;s official website says about that novel, &quot;The plot was inspired by Agatha Christie&#x27;s reflections on a mother&#x27;s feelings for a child born with disabilities and there can be little doubt that Christie was influenced by the real-life tragedy of American actress Gene Tierney.&quot;) Tierney&#x27;s friend Howard Hughes paid for Daria&#x27;s medical expenses, ensuring the girl received the best care. Tierney never forgot his acts of kindness. Daria Cassini died in 2010, at the age of 66.

Tierney and Cassini separated October 20, 1946, and entered into a property settlement agreement on November 10. Periodicals during this period record Tierney with Charles K. Feldman, including articles related to her &quot;twosoming&quot; with Feldman, her &quot;current best beau&quot;. Her divorce from Cassini was to be finalized in March 1948, but they reconciled before then. They later divorced in 1952, but remained friends until her death in November 1991.

After his death in 2006, Cassini bequeathed $500,000 in trust to Daria and $1,000,000 to Christina. Christina was unable to collect her inheritance, however, as Cassini&#x27;s widow Marianne Nestor challenged the sum in court in a lengthy case.

During her separation from Cassini, Tierney met John F. Kennedy, a young World War II veteran, who was visiting the set of &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; in 1946. They began a romance that she ended the following year after Kennedy told her he could never marry her because of his political ambitions. In 1960, Tierney sent Kennedy a note of congratulations on his victory in the presidential election. Her former husband, Cassini, would go on to design outfits for Jackie Kennedy.

In 1952, newspapers documented that Tierney was in a romantic relationship with Kirk Douglas. Later, while filming for &quot;Personal Affair&quot; in Europe, she began a romance with Prince Aly Khan. They became engaged while Khan was going through a divorce from Rita Hayworth. Their marriage plans, however, were met with fierce opposition from his father, Aga Khan III.

In 1958, Tierney met Texas oil baron W. Howard Lee, who had been married to actress Hedy Lamarr since 1953. Lee and Lamarr divorced in 1960 after a long battle over alimony. Lee and Tierney married in Aspen, Colorado, on July 11, 1960. They lived quietly in Houston, Texas, and Delray Beach, Florida until his death in 1981.

Despite her self-imposed exile in Texas, Tierney received work offers from Hollywood, prompting her to make a comeback. She appeared in a November 1960 broadcast of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, during which time she discovered that she was pregnant. Shortly after, 20th Century Fox announced Tierney would play the leading role in &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;, but she withdrew from the production after suffering a miscarriage.

As a lifelong Republican, Tierney supported Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in their elections.
Tierney is survived by her grandchildren, Delphina, Jasmina, Alexander and Cedric and her great grandchildren. 

==Later years==
Tierney&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Self-Portrait&quot;, in which she candidly discusses her life, career, her appearance, and mental illness, was published in 1979.

In 1986, Tierney was honored alongside actor Gregory Peck with the first Donostia Lifetime Achievement Award at the San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain.

Tierney has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6125 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Death==
Tierney died of emphysema on November 6, 1991, in Houston, 13 days before what would have been her 71st birthday. She is interred in Glenwood Cemetery in Houston.

Certain documents of Tierney&#x27;s film-related material, personal papers, letters, etc., are held in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives, though her papers are closed to the public.

<text>Harry Herbert Frazee (June 29, 1880 – June 4, 1929) was an American theatrical agent, producer, and director, and owner of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox from 1916 to 1923. He is well known for selling Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees, which started the alleged Curse of the Bambino.

== Early life==
Harry Frazee was born June 29, 1880, in Peoria, Illinois, son of William and Margaret Frazee. He attended Peoria High School, where he was a baseball teammate of Harry Bay, who later played for Major League Baseball teams in Cincinnati and Cleveland. At 16, Frazee became assistant manager of the Peoria Theater. Within a year, he was player-coach of the Peoria Distillers semi-pro baseball club. As his theatrical endeavors continued, Frazee moved to Chicago, where he built the Cort Theater in 1907.

After several successful shows, Frazee went to New York City, where in 1913 he built the Longacre Theatre on West 48th Street and staged hit plays such as &quot;Fine Feathers&quot; by Eugene Walter and the musical &quot;Adele&quot;. He also promoted a boxing match between Jess Willard and Jack Johnson on April 5, 1915 in Havana, Cuba and was reported by then to be a millionaire.

Frazee was a Freemason.

== Owner of the Red Sox ==

Frazee bought the Boston Red Sox baseball team from Joseph Lannin for a reported $675,000 after their victory in the 1916 World Series. The Sox won another World Series title in 1918. The team finished sixth in 1919, and after that season Frazee started selling players to the New York Yankees, most notoriously Babe Ruth. He then left the Red Sox in bankruptcy while continuing to produce theatre shows. After the sale of Ruth, the team crashed into the American League cellar and did not finish above .500 until 1934. The Red Sox did not win another pennant until 1946, and did not win another World Series until 2004. The 86-year World Series drought is the third-longest in MLB history, trailing only the Chicago Cubs (108 years from 1908 to 2016) and Chicago White Sox (88 years from 1917 to 2005).

Frazee backed a number of New York theatrical productions (before and after Ruth&#x27;s sale), the best-known of which is probably &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, which was once claimed, and later debunked, as the specific play that Ruth&#x27;s sale financed (it was actually what paid off the Fenway Park mortgage that the Ruth sale included). He was the subject of an unflattering portrait in Fred Lieb&#x27;s account of the Red Sox, which further insinuated that he had sold Ruth to finance a Broadway musical. This became a central element in the Curse of the Bambino.

The truth is more nuanced and has as much to do with a long-running dispute between Frazee and American League founder and president Ban Johnson as it does with Frazee&#x27;s finances. Frazee was the first American League owner who Johnson had not essentially hand-picked, and was unwilling to simply do Johnson&#x27;s bidding. Although they seemed to settle their differences when Frazee hired Ed Barrow, a friend of Johnson&#x27;s, as manager, their relationship worsened again when Frazee loudly criticized Johnson&#x27;s handling of the issues brought about by the United States entering World War I. For his part, Johnson was angered by the open presence of gamblers and bookies at Fenway Park. These factors led Johnson to actively seek to push Frazee out.

Additionally, Frazee&#x27;s theater ventures didn&#x27;t generate even a fraction of the capital needed to meet the Red Sox&#x27; expenses. He often found himself having to borrow from the Red Sox to meet his other commitments.

The dispute finally boiled over in the summer of 1919 when pitcher Carl Mays jumped the team. Johnson ordered him suspended, but Frazee instead sold him to the then-moribund Yankees. Johnson had promised Yankee owners Jacob Ruppert and Cap Huston to get them better players, but never followed through. The Mays flap divided the American League into two factions—the Yankees, Red Sox and Chicago White Sox on one side and the other five clubs, known as the &quot;Loyal Five&quot;, on the other.

Under the circumstances, when Frazee finally lost patience with Ruth (see below), his options were severely limited. Under pressure from Johnson, the Loyal Five rejected Frazee&#x27;s overtures almost out of hand. In effect, Johnson limited Frazee to dealing with either the White Sox or the Yankees. The White Sox offered Joe Jackson and $60,000, but the Yankees offered an all-cash deal: $25,000 up front and three promissory notes of $25,000 each, plus a $300,000 loan to be secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. With the note from Lannin that he had used in part to finance his purchase of the Red Sox having come due in November 1919, Frazee had little choice but to take the Yankees&#x27; offer. Ruth officially became the property of the Yankees on January 5, 1920.

==Fenway Park==
The Ruth sale cemented the Red Sox–Yankees alliance. A few months later, the two teams drew even closer together in a dispute over Fenway Park.

When Frazee bought the Red Sox, Fenway Park was not part of the deal. Instead, he rented it for $30,000 per year from the Fenway Realty Trust. A majority of the trust&#x27;s stock was controlled by the Taylor family, publishers of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;. The Taylor family had owned the Red Sox from 1904 to 1911 and built Fenway in the first place. They still held a small ownership interest. This put Frazee in a very difficult spot. If Johnson ever revoked the franchise, it would be relatively easy for a new owner to get a lease for the park. In August 1919, Frazee began negotiations to buy out the shares in the trust held by Lannin and the Taylors. In this way, if Johnson ever yanked the franchise out from under Frazee, any prospective owner of a Boston American League team would risk being left without a place to play.

However, Frazee had stopped paying installments because of a dispute over who owed Boston&#x27;s share of MLB&#x27;s settlement with the Federal League. In the spring of 1920, Lannin finally made good on a threat to slap a lien on the Red Sox. Since the lien barred Frazee from trading players or buying Fenway without Lannin&#x27;s permission, Lannin effectively controlled the team. Lannin also threatened to sell his interest in the Fenway Realty Trust, which would have opened the door for a new owner to buy into the park if Frazee lost the franchise. Eventually, Lannin and Frazee reached a settlement. Lannin agreed to pay the Federal League bill and would not oppose Frazee&#x27;s purchase of Fenway. In return, Frazee resumed payments. On May 3, Frazee and Taylor signed a deal to pay off the existing mortgage and make Frazee sole owner of Fenway Park.

As an additional security measure, Frazee secured a $300,000 loan from the Yankees and used a second mortgage on Fenway as collateral.

==Other deals with the Yankees==

Frazee had every intention of using the money from the Ruth deal to get better players. However, his theater interests had not done particularly well since 1918, and he found it difficult to service the debt on both Fenway Park and the Red Sox. His cash shorts became even more acute after the remortgage of Fenway Park. He was thus forced to put the team&#x27;s best players on the market in order to get cash. Unfortunately, he found it difficult to make deals with the &quot;Loyal Five&quot; even after Ruth left for New York. With the White Sox&#x27; reputation in tatters following the Black Sox Scandal, Frazee was left with little choice but to deal with the Yankees. Over the next three years, Frazee sold virtually all of the Red Sox&#x27; top players to the Yankees, netting him a total of $305,000.

Below is a record of the other trades (besides Ruth) that Frazee made with the Yankees from 1918 to 1923.

*Bullet Joe Bush—December 1921. Pitched in two pennant seasons for the Yankees. Traded for Rip Collins (pitcher), Roger Peckinpaugh, Bill Piercy, Jack Quinn.
*Joe Dugan—July 1922. Played for five Yankee pennant teams. Traded for Chick Fewster, Elmer Miller, Johnny Mitchell, Lefty O&#x27;Doul.
*Harvey Hendrick—January 1923. Never played for Red Sox; was in 1923 World Series with Yankees. Traded for Al DeVormer, who batted .254 after trade (Hendrick&#x27;s lifetime average was .308).
*Waite Hoyt—December 1920. Traded (with Harry Harper, Wally Schang, and Mike McNally) for Del Pratt, Muddy Ruel, Hank Thormahlen, and Sammy Vick. Hoyt pitched for the Yankees in ten seasons, and was in seven World Series (including the 1931 Series, with the Philadelphia A&#x27;s).
*Sad Sam Jones—December 1921. Traded with Joe Bush (q. v.). Pitched five seasons with Yankees.
*Carl Mays—July 1919. Traded to Yankees for players Bob McGraw and Allan Russell.
*Herb Pennock—January 1923. Traded to Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, and George Murray. Pennock stayed with the Yankees until 1933, pitching in five Series.
*George Pipgras—January 1923. Traded to the Yankees for Al DeVormer &quot;(supra).&quot; Pipgras never played for Boston; his eleven-year career included three Yankee pennant seasons.
*Wally Schang—December 1920. Traded to the Yankees for Pratt, Ruel, Thormahlen, and Vick. Caught for three Yankee pennant teams.
*Everett Scott—traded along with Joe Bush (q.v.). Scott set the consecutive-game playing record it took Lou Gehrig to break.
*Elmer Smith—July 1922. Traded to Yankees with Joe Dugan (q. v.). Was famous as first player (with Indians in 1920) to hit grand slam homer in World Series.

The above only includes the trades Frazee made to the Yankees from 1918 to 1923, when he was owner of the Red Sox. The &quot;Encyclopedia&quot; lists about 40 trades in all made by the Red Sox in those years, including to teams &quot;other than&quot; the Yankees.

It has been argued that the deals with the Yankees made a modicum of sense at the time, and only a stroke of bad luck turned them into Yankee heists. Notably, the players sent to Boston suffered a rash of injuries However, this is belied by the fact that Barrow became general manager of the Yankees in 1921. He&#x27;d managed nearly all of the players who came to New York in these deals, and was almost certainly aware of who he was getting. When the Yankees won their first World Series in 1923, they did so with a roster dominated by players acquired via their trades with Frazee. Half of their starting position players, as well as four-fifths of the rotation, came from the Red Sox.

==Sale of Red Sox==
In 1921, an article in the &quot;Dearborn Independent&quot; claimed that Frazee was one of many Jews who had ruined baseball. Although Frazee was not Jewish, the article played up longstanding stereotypes about Broadway impresarios. Frazee was unable to respond, since at the time it was published he was not only dealing with a divorce, but the death of his father. The article wrecked any chance Frazee had of rehabilitating himself. Although he was forced to sell to a syndicate of Midwestern businessmen fronted by Johnson crony Bob Quinn, he held out for $1.2 million—nearly double what he paid for the team in 1916. The Red Sox had some of their worst seasons ever under Quinn&#x27;s ownership after one of his principal investors died.

==Death==
 In 1929, Harry Frazee died of kidney failure in his Park Avenue home with his wife and son at his side. He is interred at Kensico Cemetery. Lou Gehrig and Ed Barrow are also interred at Kensico.

==&quot;The Top 5 Reasons You Can&#x27;t Blame...&quot;==
In 2005, ESPN Classic aired an episode in &quot;The Top 5 Reasons You Can&#x27;t Blame...&quot; series in which it examined the sale, and explained why Frazee cannot be held as the scapegoat:
* 5. World War I: With rosters depleted because of the war, Ruth saw action as both a pitcher and outfielder; the latter made him the home run hitter he would become. After the players returned, Ruth became bigger than the team because his home runs were the talk of baseball and he no longer wanted to pitch.
* 4. Ban Johnson: The president of the American League since its debut in 1901 effectively limited Frazee to the Yankees and White Sox as the only teams with whom Frazee could make a deal by pressuring the other five teams (the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns and Washington Senators) not to make any trades at all with Frazee.
* 3. Babe Ruth&#x27;s antics: He often spent evenings out in bars and was often drunk only hours before games. He also jumped the team several times, the final straw being in the final game of the 1919 season.

* 2. Ed Barrow: Frazee&#x27;s right-hand man, Barrow served as general manager and field manager. Like Frazee, Barrow also knew how much of a troublemaker Ruth was. When Frazee wanted to send Ruth to the Yankees, Barrow, for reasons unknown, said the Yankees didn&#x27;t have any players he wanted. In a bizarre twist of fate, Barrow left the Red Sox after the 1920 season to become general manager of none other than the Yankees and built the team to World Champions by 1923 by acquiring as many as seven players from the Red Sox (four of whom had won the World Series in Boston in 1918).
* 1. Babe Ruth&#x27;s holdout: Ruth forced Frazee&#x27;s hand by holding out after the 1919 season, demanding $20,000 per year—twice as much as he had been making during the season. During the holdout, he planned other ventures, such as becoming a boxer and going into acting. Frazee was upset over the holdout because he had given Ruth bonuses after both the 1918 and 1919 seasons. Finally, with Ruth&#x27;s demands so high and after several occasions in which Ruth had already jumped the team, Frazee felt he had no choice but to ship Ruth out.

An &quot;honorable mention&quot; was Shoeless Joe Jackson. Frazee wanted to trade Ruth to the White Sox for Jackson, but the Black Sox Scandal scuttled those plans.

<text>Leave Her to Heaven is a 1945 American film directed by John M. Stahl and starring Gene Tierney, Cornel Wilde, Jeanne Crain, and Vincent Price. It follows a socialite who marries a prominent novelist, which spurs a violent, obsessive, and dangerous jealousy in her. It is based on the 1944 novel of the same name by Ben Ames Williams, adapted by screenwriter Jo Swerling.

Shot in Technicolor, filming took place in several locations in California, as well as Arizona and New Mexico in the summer of 1945. &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; was released in the United States theatrically on December 20, 1945. The film was a box-office hit, grossing over $8 million, and was Twentieth Century-Fox&#x27;s highest-grossing film of the entire decade.

In the decades following its release, &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; garnered a cult following and has been the subject of film criticism for its unique blurring of genres, featuring elements of film noir, psychological thrillers, and melodramas. It has also been noted for its numerous visual and narrative references to figures in Greek mythology. The film&#x27;s title is drawn from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which the Ghost urges Hamlet not to seek vengeance against Queen Gertrude, but rather to &quot;leave her to heaven, and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her.&quot;

In 2018, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
While traveling by train in New Mexico, novelist Richard Harland meets Ellen Berent, a beautiful socialite from Boston. She is particularly drawn to him, as he reminds her of her deceased father, to whom she had an obsessive attachment. Ellen is visiting New Mexico to spread her father&#x27;s ashes, accompanied by her aloof mother and her cousin Ruth, who was adopted by Mrs. Berent (Richard is surprised when Ruth tells him this, and wonders why she did not say &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Berent&quot; adopted her).

Richard and Ellen discover they are staying with the same friends, and begin a whirlwind romance. He is fascinated by Ellen&#x27;s exotic beauty and intense personality. The couple&#x27;s affair is interrupted when Ellen&#x27;s estranged fiancé, attorney Russell Quinton, arrives unexpectedly. Ellen then announces that she intends to marry Richard immediately, to Richard&#x27;s surprise.

Ellen and Richard marry in Warm Springs, Georgia before staying at his lodge on a lake in northern Maine. Their domestic life is copacetic at first, but it becomes gradually apparent that she is pathologically jealous of anyone and anything he cares about, including his family and career.

During an unexpected visit from Ellen&#x27;s family, her mother attempts to warn Richard that Ellen is prone to obsessiveness and a compulsion to &quot;love too much&quot;. Ellen&#x27;s resentment only grows when Richard&#x27;s beloved teenage brother, Danny, crippled by the effects of polio, comes to live with them. One afternoon, Ellen follows him on the lake in a rowboat as he attempts to swim from one end to the other. She knowingly encourages him to press on, even as Danny begins to struggle to stay afloat. Ellen watches from the boat as he sinks below the surface and drowns.
Danny&#x27;s death is presumed an accident, and Ellen feigns sympathy. After settling at their home in Bar Harbor, Richard is despondent. At Ruth&#x27;s suggestion, Ellen becomes pregnant in an attempt to please Richard, but later confesses to Ruth that she does not want the child, likening it to a &quot;little beast&quot;.

One afternoon, Ellen throws herself down a staircase to induce a miscarriage. She succeeds in terminating the pregnancy, and after recovering in the hospital, accuses Ruth of being in love with Richard, citing a dedication in his new novel that alludes to her. Ruth rebukes Ellen by accusing her of causing the misery that has befallen the family. Richard overhears the argument, and confronts Ellen for the deaths of Danny and of their unborn child. Ellen admits without remorse to having let Danny drown, and cruelly tells Richard she would do it again if given the chance. Angered, Richard leaves Ellen, but does not pursue criminal action as he does not believe there is sufficient evidence.

An enraged Ellen sends a letter to Russell—now the county district attorney—in which she accuses Ruth of plotting to murder her. While on a picnic with Ruth and her mother several days later, Ellen secretly poisons herself with sugar laced with arsenic, which sends her into multiple organ failure over several days. When Richard visits a dying Ellen on her deathbed, she requests in his confidence that she be cremated, and that he scatter her ashes where she spread her father&#x27;s in New Mexico, to which he agrees.

After Ellen dies, Ruth has her remains cremated at Richard&#x27;s instruction. She is subsequently charged with Ellen&#x27;s murder, prosecuted by Russell. During the trial, Russell proposes that Ruth plotted to kill Ellen so she and Richard could be together, and frames Ruth&#x27;s cremation of Ellen as a calculated decision to prevent an autopsy.

A recalcitrant Richard testifies regarding Ellen&#x27;s psychopathic jealousy, insisting that she made her own suicide appear as a murder to punish him and Ruth. Ruth is ultimately acquitted, but he is sentenced to two years imprisonment as an accessory in Danny&#x27;s death, as he withheld his knowledge of Ellen&#x27;s actions. After completing his sentence, Richard returns to his lodge, where he is welcomed lovingly by Ruth.

==Analysis==
===Mythical allusions===
The film features a number of allusions to classical Greek mythology, largely the protagonist, Ellen Berent&#x27;s exhibition of an Electra complex, displaying an obsession with her deceased father. The sequence in which Ellen is shown carrying her father&#x27;s ashes in an urn, held at her waist while she rides on a horse, is a visual reference to the Greek goddess Hippolyta and the magical girdle bestowed upon her by her father Ares, the god of war.

Scholar S. T. Joshi likens the character of Ellen to a Siren, a mythical water creature who lured sailors to their deaths. This allusion is supported by film noir scholar Imogen Sara Smith, who notes that Ellen is frequently associated with water and shown swimming, &quot;like a mermaid, cold-blooded and alien, preying on a hapless human male.&quot;

Ellen&#x27;s scheming alludes to Medea, an intelligent and cunning figure in Greek mythology who murders her own children.

===Genre and the &quot;femme fatale&quot;===
&quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; is often described as the first film noir to be shot in color, although film scholars and critics have characterized the film as a thriller, a melodrama (Walker), a psychological melodrama (Turim), a women&#x27;s film (Morris), or a romantic drama (Bourget). Scholar Emanuel Levy notes that the film embodies both &quot;conventions of the noir and psychological melodrama,&quot; blurring the distinction and resulting in a unique, one-of-a-kind work.

Joshi identifies Ellen Berent as one of the prime examples of the &quot;femme fatale&quot; in film history. Film and feminist theorist and writer Mary Ann Doane notes that Ellen&#x27;s &quot;excessive desire&quot; for Richard is signaled by her &quot;intense and sustained stare&quot; at him in the beginning of the film. Over the course of the film, Ellen reveals her possessiveness in increasingly violent and destructive ways, rendering her, in Doane&#x27;s words, &quot;the epitome of evil.&quot; Smith notes that Ellen is an atypical example of the &quot;femme fatale&quot; as, unlike with many of her contemporaries, her impulses to kill and wreak destruction are driven purely by a pathological yearning for love, whereas the prototypical &quot;femme fatale&quot; is often motivated by financial or other social reasons. Critics who argue that the film is not a film noir note that Ellen does not seduce Richard into acting against his interests or breaking the law (in short, that she is not a femme fatale) (Walker).

==Production==
===Development===

In May 1944, Twentieth Century Fox executive Darryl F. Zanuck purchased the rights to Ben Ames Williams then-unpublished novel, &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot;, planning a screen adaptation. The studio spent an exorbitant $100,000 to acquire the rights to Ames&#x27; novel, which was published the following month in June 1944. The title of the film and its source novel is derived from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;: In Act I, Scene V, the Ghost urges Hamlet not to seek vengeance against Queen Gertrude, but rather to &quot;leave her to heaven, and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her.&quot;

In November 1944, the Production Code Administration (PCA) approved Jo Swerling&#x27;s screenplay adaptation of the novel, though they strongly encouraged the studio to minimize the depiction of Ellen inducing her own miscarriage. In their response, the PCA noted: &quot;It will be absolutely essential to remove any flavor... that Ellen plans to murder the unborn child merely because she is misshapen. It should be definitely established that her reason for murdering the child is that she thinks that the newborn will replace her in her husband&#x27;s affections. This is important in order to avoid any of the flavor that is normally connected with what could be termed &#x27;abortion&#x27;.&quot;

A subsequent draft submitted to the PCA in February 1945 was disapproved as it overtly implied that Richard and Ellen had engaged in an illicit sexual affair before their marriage. After the affair was minimized in a subsequent draft, the screenplay was approved for shooting.

===Casting===
Producer Zanuck offered the leading role of Ellen Berent to Gene Tierney, based on her performance in Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s film noir &quot;Laura&quot; (1944).
Faye Marlowe was originally cast in the role of Ruth, but ultimately replaced by Jeanne Crain. Thomas Mitchell was cast as Glen Robie, though he too was replaced, by Ray Collins.

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; took place between May and August 1945. The production initially planned to shoot the lake and surrounding outdoor sequences in the Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon, though the planned locations in the region were ultimately not utilized. Instead, these scenes were filmed in Northern California at Bass Lake in the Sierra Nevada. Additional photography took place in Monterey.

The desert sequences that take place in New Mexico were filmed in several locations in Arizona, including Sedona, Flagstaff, and the Granite Dells north of Prescott. The sequences set in Warm Springs, Georgia were filmed at Busch Gardens in Pasadena, though long shots and process plates were shot on location at the actual Warm Springs Foundation.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; premiered in the United States on December 20, 1945 at the Carthay Circle Theater in Los Angeles. It subsequently had its New York City premiere on Christmas Day 1945. It was the second highest-grossing film of 1945, second only to &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;, earning $5,505,000 in domestic rentals. Internationally, the film earned $2.7 million in rentals, making for a worldwide rental gross of $8.2 million.

===Critical response===
The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing &quot;Sumptuous Technicolor mounting and a highly exploitable story lend considerable importance to &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; that it might not have had otherwise...Tierney and Wilde use their personalities in interpreting their dramatic assignments. Crain&#x27;s role of Tierney&#x27;s foster-sister is more subdued but excellently done. Vincent Price, as the discarded lover, gives a theatrical reading to the courtroom scenes as the district attorney.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Bosley Crowther was less enthusiastic about the film, writing: &quot;Christmas Day was an inauspicious moment to bring in a moody, morbid film which is all about a selfish, jealous and deceitful dame... The fact is, however, that this picture would be little more congenial at any time, for it is plainly a piece of cheap fiction done up in Technicolor and expensive sets.&quot;

The film was cited by director Martin Scorsese as one of his favorite films and assessed &quot;Gene Tierney is one of the most underrated actresses of the Golden Era.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes reported that 85% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 65 reviews. The consensus summarizes: &quot;&quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; suffers from a surfeit of unlikable characters, but the solid cast – led by an outstanding Gene Tierney – makes it hard to turn away.&quot;

In the decades after its release, the film garnered a cult following. Critic Emanuel Levy attributes its cult status to its blurring of genres, ultimately resulting in a &quot;one of a kind work.&quot; In 2018, it was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

&quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; was restored by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with Twentieth Century Fox, in 2006.

Author Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni mentions this film in her novel &quot;Independence&quot; (2022).

<doc id="181356" wikidata="Q1672782" url="?curid=181356" title="Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference">
<text>The Irish Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference () is the episcopal conference of the Roman Catholic bishops in Ireland. The conference meets a number of times a year in Maynooth which is the location of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Ireland&#x27;s national seminary. While each bishop is autonomous in his own diocese, meetings of the conference give bishops a chance to discuss issues of mutual concern, or issues of national policy.

==Background==
In the Catholic Church, an episcopal conference is an official assembly of all the bishops of a given territory. Episcopal conferences have long existed as informal entities, but were first established as formal bodies by the Second Vatican Council (&quot;Christus Dominus&quot;, 38), and implemented by Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1966 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ecclesiae sanctae&quot;. The operation, authority, and responsibilities of episcopal conferences are currently governed by the 1983 Code of Canon Law (see especially canons 447–459). The nature of episcopal conferences, and their magisterial authority in particular, was subsequently clarified by Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1998 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Apostolos suos&quot;.

Certain tasks and authority are assigned to episcopal conferences, particularly with regard to setting the liturgical norms for the Mass. Episcopal conferences receive their authority under universal law or particular mandates. In certain circumstances, as defined by canon law, the decisions of an episcopal conference are subject to ratification from the Holy See. Individual bishops do not relinquish their authority to the conference, and remain responsible for the governance of their respective diocese.

The Conference owns the publisher and retailer Veritas Communications.

==Composition==
The Irish Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference is made up of the 26 Irish diocesan bishops (ordinaries) and a number of auxiliary bishops. The conference membership extends to both government jurisdictions on the island of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

==Structure==
Beneath the Bishops&#x27; Conference are the regional or provincial meetings of bishops.

Episcopal conferences are generally defined by geographic borders, with all the bishops in a given country belonging to the same conference – which might also include neighboring countries.

The Archbishop of Armagh, as Primate of All Ireland, chairs the Conference.

Much of the work of the Conference is done in committees which cover issues such as laity, liturgy, family, social justice. Each committee is chaired by a bishop, though not always an ordinary.

==Presidency==
By convention, the Archbishop of Armagh as the most-senior churchman in Ireland, presides and is the principal spokesman. This tradition has prevailed even when the Archbishop of Dublin is a cardinal and the Archbishop of Armagh is not a member of the College of Cardinals.

===List of presidents===





==Political activity==
===Abortion===
In keeping with Catholic views on abortion, the Conference campaigns against the legalisation of abortion. It called for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the 2002 abortion referendum which would have overturned the 1992 X Case judgement. It called the proposal &quot;an opportunity not to be lost&quot; The Conference condemned the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013.

==Extraordinary general meetings==
*April 2002 – Ferns Report and resignation of Bishop Brendan Comiskey
*October 2005 – publication of the National Board for Safeguarding Children report on child protection in the Cloyne diocese
*January 2009 – publication of the National Board for Safeguarding Children report on child protection in the Cloyne diocese.
*Friday 22 January 2010 – anticipation of the forthcoming pastoral letter from Pope Benedict XVI to the faithful of Ireland after the Ryan and Murphy reports.

<doc id="181361" wikidata="Q1712140" url="?curid=181361" title="Revenge">
<text>Revenge is defined as committing a harmful action against a person or group in response to a grievance, be it real or perceived. Vengeful forms of justice, such as primitive justice or retributive justice, are often differentiated from more formal and refined forms of justice such as distributive justice or restorative justice.

==Function in society==

Social psychologist Ian Mckee states that the desire for the sustenance of power motivates vengeful behavior as a means of impression management: &quot;People who are more vengeful tend to be those who are motivated by power, by authority and by the desire for status. They don&#x27;t want to lose face&quot;.

Vengeful behavior has been found across a majority of human societies throughout history. Some societies encourage vengeful behavior, which is then called a feud. These societies usually regard the honor of individuals and groups as of central importance. Thus, while protecting their reputation, an avenger feels as if they restore the previous state of dignity and justice. According to Michael Ignatieff, &quot;Revenge is a profound moral desire to keep faith with the dead, to honor their memory by taking up their cause where they left off&quot;. Thus, honor may become a heritage that passes from generation to generation. Whenever it is compromised, the affected family or community members might feel compelled to retaliate against an offender to restore the initial &quot;balance of honor&quot; that preceded the perceived injury. This cycle of honor might expand by bringing the family members and then the entire community of the new victim into the brand-new, endless cycle of revenge that may pervade generations.

== History ==

Francis Bacon described revenge as a kind of &quot;wild justice&quot; that &quot;does [..]. offend the law [and] putteth the law out of office.&quot;

Feuds are cycles of provocation and retaliation, fueled by a desire for revenge and carried out over long periods of time by familial or tribal groups. They were an important part of many pre-industrial societies, especially in the Mediterranean region. They still persist in some areas, notably in Albania with its tradition of &quot;gjakmarrja&quot; or &quot;blood feuds&quot;, revenge that is carried out not only by the individual, but by their extended relations for generations to come.

Blood feuds are still practised in many parts of the world, including Kurdish regions of Turkey and in Papua New Guinea.

In Japan, honouring one&#x27;s family, clan, or lord through the practice of revenge killings is called &quot;katakiuchi&quot; (敵討ち). These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. Today, katakiuchi is most often pursued by peaceful means, but revenge remains an important part of Japanese culture.

==Social psychology==

Philosophers tend to believe that to punish and to take revenge are vastly different activities: &quot;One who undertakes to punish rationally does not do so for the sake of the wrongdoing, which is now in the past - but for the sake of the future, that the wrongdoing shall not be repeated, either by him, or by others who see him, or by others who see him punished&quot;. In contrast, seeking revenge is motivated by a yearning to see a transgressor suffer; revenge is necessarily preceded by anger, whereas punishment does not have to be.

Indeed, Kaiser, Vick, and Major point out the following: &quot;An important psychological implication of the various efforts to define revenge is that
there is no objective standard for declaring an act to be motivated by revenge or not.
Revenge is a label that is ascribed based on perceivers’ attributions for the act. Revenge
is an inference, regardless of whether the individuals making the inference are the harmdoers themselves, the injured parties, or outsiders. Because revenge is an inference, various individuals can disagree on whether the same action is revenge or not.&quot;

Belief in the just-world fallacy is also associated with revenge: in particular, having strong experiences or challenges against, can increase distress and motivate individuals to seek revenge, as a means of justice restoration.

A growing body of research reveals that a vengeful &quot;disposition&quot; is correlated to adverse health outcomes: strong desires for revenge and greater willingness to act on these desires have been correlated with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and psychiatric morbidity.

==Proverbs==
The popular expression &quot;revenge is a dish best served cold&quot; suggests that revenge is more satisfying if enacted when unexpected or long-feared, inverting traditional civilized revulsion toward &quot;cold-blooded&quot; violence.

The idea&#x27;s origin is obscure. The French diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord (1754–1838) has been credited with the saying, &quot;La vengeance est un met que l&#x27;on doit manger froid&quot; [&quot;Revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold&quot;], albeit without supporting detail. The concept has been in the English language at least since the 1846 translation of the 1845 French novel &quot;Mathilde&quot; by Joseph Marie Eugène Sue: &quot;la vengeance se mange très bien froide&quot;, there italicized as if quoting a proverbial saying, and translated &quot;revenge is very good eaten cold&quot;. The phrase has been wrongly credited to the novel &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; (1782).

The phrase has also been credited to the Pashtuns of Afghanistan.

Earlier speakers of English might use the set phrase &quot;with a &quot; rather than the more modern standard &quot;with a vengeance&quot; to express intensity.

A Japanese proverb states, &quot;If you want revenge, then dig two graves&quot;. While this reference is frequently misunderstood by Western audiences, the Japanese reader understands that this proverb means that enactors of revenge must be more dedicated to killing their enemy than to surviving the ordeal themselves.

== In art ==

Revenge is a popular subject across many forms of art. Some examples include the painting &quot;Herodias&#x27; Revenge&quot; by Juan de Flandes and the operas &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, both by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. In Japanese art, revenge is a theme in various woodblock prints depicting the forty-seven rōnin by many well-known and influential artists, including Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The Chinese playwright Ji Junxiang used revenge as the central theme in his theatrical work &quot;The Orphan of Zhao&quot;; it depicts more specifically familial revenge, which is placed in the context of Confucian morality and social hierarchical structure.

== In literature ==
Revenge has been a popular literary theme historically and continues to play a role in contemporary works. Examples of literature that feature revenge as a theme include the plays &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; by William Shakespeare, the novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, and the short story &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. More modern examples include the novels &quot;Carrie&quot; by Stephen King, &quot;Gone Girl&quot; by Gillian Flynn, and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; by William Goldman. Although revenge is a theme in itself, it is also considered to be a genre.

Revenge as a genre has been consistent with a variety of themes that have frequently appeared in different texts over the last few centuries. Such themes include but are not limited to: disguise, masking, sex, cannibalism, the grotesque, bodily fluids, power, violent murders, and secrecy. Each theme is usually coupled with the concept of dramatic irony. Dramatic irony is a literary device in which the audience possesses knowledge unavailable to characters in a novel, play, or film. Its purpose is to intensify the tragic events that are going to unfold by creating tension between the audience and the actions of the characters.

The most common theme within the genre of revenge is the recurring violent murders that take place throughout the text, especially in the final act or scene. The root of the violence is usually derived from the characters&#x27; childhood development.

The themes of masking and disguise have the ability to go hand in hand with each other. A character may employ disguise literally or metaphorically. A mask is the literal example of this theme; while pretending to be something one is not is considered to be the metaphoric example. Additional themes that may cause the protagonist and antagonist to develop a masked or disguised identity include sex, power, and even cannibalism. Examples of sex and power being used as themes can be seen in the novel &quot;Gone Girl&quot; by Gillian Flynn, as well as the aforementioned drama, &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;.

== On the internet ==
The emergence of the internet has provided new ways of exacting revenge. Customer revenge targets businesses and corporations with the intent to cause damage or harm. In general, people tend to place more credence in online reviews rather than corporate communications. With technology becoming more readily available, corporations and firms are more likely to experience damage caused by negative reviews posted online going viral. Recent studies indicate this type of consumer rage aimed at corporations is becoming more common, especially in Western societies.

The rise of social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube act as public platforms for exacting new forms of revenge. Revenge porn involves the vengeful public dissemination of intimate pictures and videos of another person&#x27;s sexual activity with the intent of creating widespread shame. Participation in online revenge porn activities incites a sense of pleasure through the harm, embarrassment, and humiliation being inflicted on the victim. The allowance of anonymity on revenge porn sites encourages further incivility by empowering and encouraging this type of behavior. In many instances, the original poster provides the victim&#x27;s personal information, including links to social media accounts, furthering the harassment. Online revenge porn&#x27;s origins can be traced to 2010 when Hunter Moore created the first site, &quot;IsAnyoneUp&quot;, to share nude photos of his girlfriend.

== In animals ==
Humans are not the only species known to take revenge. There are several species such as camels, elephants, fish, lions, coots, crows, and many species of primates (chimpanzees, macaques, baboons, etc.) that have been recognized to seek revenge. Primatologists Frans de Waal and Lesleigh Luttrellave conducted numerous studies that provide evidence of revenge in many species of primates. They observed chimpanzees and noticed patterns of revenge. For example, if chimpanzee A helped chimpanzee B defeat his opponent, chimpanzee C, then chimpanzee C would be more likely to help chimpanzee A&#x27;s opponent in a later squabble. Chimpanzees are one of the most common species that show revenge due to their desire for dominance. Studies have also been performed on less cognitive species such as fish to demonstrate that not only intellectual animals execute revenge. Studies of crows by Professor John Marzluff have also shown that some animals can carry &quot;blood feuds&quot; in similar ways to humans. Using a &quot;dangerous&quot; mask to cover their face and trap, band, and then release crows, Marzluff observed that within two weeks, a significant percentage of crows encountered - 26%, to be exact - would &quot;scold&quot; the people wearing the dangerous mask, proving that crows pass information pertaining to feuds within their family units to spread awareness about dangers they may face. This included crows not initially trapped by the mask-wearing researchers, seeing as some of the crows were un-banded. This was further proven three years after the initial study, as the percentage of &quot;scolding&quot; crows increased to 66% from the initial 26%.

<doc id="181364" wikidata="Q903496" url="?curid=181364" title="Delerium">
<text>Delerium is a Canadian new-age ambient electronic musical duo that formed in 1987, originally as a side project of the influential industrial music act Front Line Assembly. Throughout the band&#x27;s history, their musical style has encompassed a broad range, including dark ethereal ambient trance, voiceless industrial soundscapes, and electronic pop music. They are best known for their worldwide hit &quot;Silence&quot;. The band is known to feature female guest vocalists on their albums since their 1994 album &quot;Semantic Spaces&quot;.

==Members and history==
Delerium has traditionally been a two-person project, but the only constant member throughout its history has been Bill Leeb. Leeb was an early member of industrial music pioneers Skinny Puppy, but after he left in 1986 he went on to create his own project, Front Line Assembly, with collaborator Michael Balch. Later, the two worked on the side project Delerium and released their first album, &quot;Faces, Forms &amp; Illusions&quot;. After Balch left both Front Line Assembly and Delerium, Leeb worked with Rhys Fulber, and the two released several albums under the Delerium moniker; these years saw a gradual stylistic change from darker ambient to a more danceable sound. After the release of &quot;Karma&quot;, Fulber left to pursue other interests, and Leeb teamed up with producer Chris Peterson to release &quot;Poem&quot;. 2003, however, saw the reunion of Leeb and Fulber for the release of &quot;Chimera&quot;, followed by &quot;Nuages du Monde&quot; in 2006.

In contrast to Leeb and collaborators&#x27; other projects, Delerium has included several guest vocalists since the release of &quot;Semantic Spaces&quot;. These have included mostly women, such as Kristy Thirsk (of Rose Chronicles), Sarah McLachlan, Leigh Nash (of Sixpence None the Richer), Elsieanne Caplette (of Elsiane), Lisa Gerrard (sampled only), Jaël (of Swiss band Lunik), Camille Henderson, Nerina Pallot, Emily Haines (of Metric), Jacqui Hunt (of Single Gun Theory), Isabel Bayrakdarian and Shelley Harland. Other than Leeb, only three males have contributed vocals to a Delerium album: Matthew Sweet (&quot;Daylight&quot;, on &quot;Poem&quot;), Greg Froese (&quot;Apparition&quot;, on &quot;Nuages du Monde&quot;), and Michael Logen (&quot;Days Turn into Nights&quot;, on &quot;Music Box Opera&quot;); in addition, the noted griot Baaba Maal was sampled (&quot;Awakenings, on &quot;Spiritual Archives&quot;).

The Mediæval Bæbes provided the vocal track for, and starred in the video of, &quot;Aria&quot;; the vocals are an adapted version of the vocals from &quot;All Turns to Yesterday&quot; on the Bæbes&#x27; &quot;Worldes Blysse&quot; album. They are also featured on two tracks from Delerium&#x27;s 2006 album, &quot;Nuages du Monde&quot;.

In addition to these two mainstays, related collaborations between Leeb and Fulber, Peterson, and/or Balch include Equinox, Intermix, Noise Unit, Pro-Tech, and Synæsthesia, among others. In addition, in 2007 Leeb and Fulber collaborated with Leigh Nash under the name Fauxliage. Rhys Fulber has also maintained a solo project Conjure One since his temporary exit from Delerium.

==Music==

The single &quot;Silence&quot;, featuring vocals by Sarah McLachlan, reached number three on the UK music charts. In 2000, three years after &quot;Karma&quot; was released, notable DJs such as Tiësto and Airscape produced remixes of &quot;Silence&quot;, which generated interest and gained considerable radio airplay for the original track, albeit most airplay was for the remixes.

In 2003, Delerium embarked on their first tour, with vocals performed by Kristy Thirsk and Shelley Harland. In January 2005, Delerium performed at the &quot;One World&quot; benefit concert in Vancouver for the 2004 Asian tsunami, where &quot;Silence&quot; was performed live for the first time with Sarah McLachlan. The song has been described as one of the greatest trance songs of all time.

==Awards==
Delerium has received two Juno Awards for Best Dance Recording: in 1998 for &quot;Euphoria (Rabbit in the Moon Mix)&quot;, and in 2000 for &quot;Silence&quot;.

<doc id="181376" wikidata="Q241583" url="?curid=181376" title="Bret Easton Ellis">
<text>Bret Easton Ellis (born March 7, 1964) is an American author and screenwriter. Ellis was one of the literary Brat Pack and is a self-proclaimed satirist whose trademark technique as a writer is the expression of extreme acts and opinions in an affectless style. His novels commonly share recurring characters.

When Ellis was 21, his first novel, the controversial bestseller &quot;Less than Zero&quot; (1985), was published by Simon &amp; Schuster. His third novel, &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991), was his most successful. Upon its release the literary establishment widely condemned it as overly violent and misogynistic. Though many petitions to ban the book saw Ellis dropped by Simon &amp; Schuster, the resounding controversy convinced Alfred A. Knopf to release it as a paperback later that year.

Ellis&#x27;s novels have become increasingly metafictional. &quot;Lunar Park&quot; (2005), a pseudo-memoir and ghost story, received positive reviews. &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot; (2010), marketed as a sequel to &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, continues in this vein. &quot;The Shards&quot; (2023) is a fictionalized memoir of Ellis&#x27;s final year of high school in 1981 Los Angeles.

Four of Ellis&#x27;s works have been made into films. &quot;Less than Zero&quot; was adapted in 1987 as a film of the same name but the film bore little resemblance to the novel. Mary Harron&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;American Psycho&quot; was released in 2000. Roger Avary&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; was released in 2002. &quot;The Informers&quot;, co-written by Ellis and based on his collection of short stories, was released in 2008. Ellis also wrote the screenplay for the 2013 film &quot;The Canyons&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Ellis was born in Los Angeles in 1964, and raised in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley. His father, Robert Martin Ellis, was a property developer, and his mother, Dale Ellis (née Dennis), was a homemaker. They divorced in 1982. During the initial release of his third novel, &quot;American Psycho&quot;, Ellis said that his father was abusive and was the basis of the book&#x27;s best-known character, Patrick Bateman. Later Ellis said the character was not in fact based on his father, but on Ellis himself, saying that all of his work came from a specific place of pain he was going through in his life during the writing of each of his books. Ellis says that while his family life growing up was somewhat difficult due to the divorce, he mostly had an &quot;idyllic&quot; California childhood.

Ellis graduated from The Buckley School in Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles. He then attended Bennington College in Bennington, Vermont, where he studied music and then gradually gravitated to writing, which had been one of his passions since childhood. At Bennington College, he met and befriended Donna Tartt and Jonathan Lethem, who both later became published writers. At Bennington College, he also completed his first novel, &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, which was published while Ellis was 21 and still in college.

==Career==
After the success and controversy of &quot;Less than Zero&quot; in 1985, Ellis became closely associated and good friends with fellow Brat Pack writer Jay McInerney: the two became known as the &quot;toxic twins&quot; for their highly publicized late-night debauchery. Ellis became a pariah for a time following the release of &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991), which later became a critical and cult hit, more so after its 2000 movie adaptation. It is now regarded as Ellis&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, garnering acknowledgement from a number of academics. &quot;The Informers&quot; (1994) was offered to his publisher during &quot;Glamorama&quot;&#x27;s long writing history. Ellis wrote a screenplay for &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;″s film adaptation, which was not used. He records a fictionalized version of his life story up until this point in the first chapter of &quot;Lunar Park&quot; (2005). After the death of his lover Michael Wade Kaplan, Ellis was spurred to finish &quot;Lunar Park&quot; and inflected it with a new tone of wistfulness. Ellis was approached by young screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki to adapt &quot;The Informers&quot; into a film; the script they co-wrote was cut from 150 to 94 pages and taken from Jarecki to give to Australian director Gregor Jordan, whose light-on-humor vision of the film met with negative reviews when it was released in 2009.

Despite setbacks as a screenwriter, Ellis teamed up with director Gus Van Sant in 2009 to adapt the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article &quot;The Golden Suicides&quot; into a film of the same name, depicting the paranoid final days and suicides of celebrity artists Theresa Duncan and Jeremy Blake. The film, as of 2024, had not been made. When Van Sant appeared on &quot;The Bret Easton Ellis Podcast&quot; on February 12, 2014, he stated that he was never attached to the project as a screenwriter or a director, merely a consultant, saying that the material seemed too tricky for him to properly render on screen. Ellis and Van Sant mentioned that Naomi Watts and Ryan Gosling were approached to star as Duncan and Blake, respectively. Ellis confirmed that he and his producing partner Braxton Pope were still working on the project, with Ellis revisiting the screenplay from time to time. As of April 2014, radical filmmaker Gaspar Noé was officially attached to direct if the film went into production, but he proved troublesome to work with due to his erratic behavior.

In 2010, Ellis released &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot;, the sequel to his début novel. Ellis wrote it following his return to LA. It fictionalizes his work on the film adaptation of &quot;The Informers&quot;, from the perspective of Clay. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave the book a positive review, saying, &quot;Ellis fans will delight in the characters and Ellis&#x27;s easy hand in manipulating their fates, and though the novel&#x27;s synchronicity with Zero is sublime, this also works as a stellar stand-alone.&quot; Ellis expressed interest in writing the screenplay for the &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; film adaptation. He discussed casting with his followers, and even mentioned meeting with the film&#x27;s producers, as well as noting he felt it went well. The job eventually went to Kelly Marcel, Patrick Marber and Mark Bomback. In 2012 Ellis wrote the screenplay for the independent film &quot;The Canyons&quot; and helped raise money for its production. The film was released in 2013 and critically panned, but was a modest financial success, with Lindsay Lohan&#x27;s performance in the lead role earning some positive reviews.

==Personal life==
When asked in an interview in 2002 whether he was gay, Ellis explained that he did not identify as gay or straight, but was comfortable being thought of as homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual and enjoyed playing with his persona, identifying variously as gay, straight, and bisexual to different people over the years. In a February 1999 interview, Ellis suggested that his reluctance to definitively label his sexuality was for &quot;artistic reasons&quot;. &quot;If people knew that I was straight, they&#x27;d read [my books] in a different way. If they knew I was gay, &quot;Psycho&quot; would be read as a different book,&quot; he told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. In an interview with Robert F. Coleman, Ellis said he had an &quot;indeterminate sexuality&quot;, that &quot;any other interviewer out there will get a different answer and it just depends on the mood I am in&quot;.

In a 2011 interview with James Brown, Ellis again said that his answers to questions about his sexuality have varied and discussed being labelled &quot;bi&quot; by a &quot;Details&quot; interviewer. &quot;I think the last time I slept with a woman was five or six years ago, so the bi thing can only be played out so long&quot;, he said. &quot;But I still use it, I still say it.&quot; Responding to Dan Savage&#x27;s It Gets Better campaign, aimed at preventing suicide among LGBT youth, Ellis tweeted, &quot;Not to bum everyone out, but can we get a reality check here? It gets worse.&quot; In a 2012 op-ed for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, while apologizing for a series of controversial tweets, Ellis came out as gay.

&quot;Lunar Park&quot; was dedicated to Ellis&#x27;s lover, Michael Wade Kaplan, who died shortly before he finished the book and to Ellis&#x27;s father, Robert Ellis, who died in 1992. In one interview Ellis described feeling a liberation in the completion of the novel that allowed him to come to terms with unresolved issues about his father. In the &quot;author Q&amp;A&quot; for &quot;Lunar Park&quot; on the Random House website, Ellis comments on his relationship with Robert, and says he feels that his father was a &quot;tough case&quot; who left him damaged. Having grown older and &quot;mellow[ed] out&quot;, Ellis describes how his opinion of his father changed since 15 years ago when writing &quot;Glamorama&quot; (in which the central conspiracy concerns the relationship of a father and son).

Earlier in his career, Ellis said he based the character Patrick Bateman in &quot;American Psycho&quot; on his father, but in a 2010 interview he said he had lied about this explanation. Explaining that &quot;Patrick Bateman was about me,&quot; he said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to finally own up to the responsibility of being Patrick Bateman, so I laid it on my father, I laid it on Wall Street.&quot; In reality, the book was &quot;about me at the time, and I wrote about all my rage and feelings.&quot; To James Brown, he clarified that Bateman was based on &quot;my father a little bit but I was living that lifestyle; my father wasn&#x27;t in New York the same age as Patrick Bateman, living in the same building, going to the same places that Patrick Bateman was going to.&quot;

Ellis named his first novel and his 2010 novel after two Elvis Costello references: &quot;Less than Zero&quot; and &quot;Imperial Bedroom&quot;, respectively. Ellis called Bruce Springsteen his &quot;musical hero&quot; in a 2010 interview with &quot;NME&quot;. 

In 2023, when asked about his political views, Ellis replied, &quot;I&#x27;m not a conservative or a liberal. At least in the US, I can&#x27;t agree with either of them. I think they&#x27;re both completely bonkers.&quot;

==Work==

Ellis&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, is a tale of disaffected, rich teenagers of Los Angeles written and rewritten over a five-year period from Ellis&#x27;s second year in high school, earlier drafts being &quot;... more autobiographical and read like teen diaries or journal entries—lots of stuff about the bands I liked, the beach, the Galleria, clubs, driving around, doing drugs, partying&quot;, according to Ellis.

The novel was praised by critics and sold well, 50,000 copies in its first year. He moved back to New York City in 1987 for the publication of his second novel, &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;—described by Ellis as &quot;an attempt to write the kind of college novel I had always wanted to read and could never find&quot;—which follows a group of sexually promiscuous college students. Influenced heavily by James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and its stream-of-consciousness narrative technique, the book sold fairly well, though Ellis admits he felt he had &quot;fallen off&quot; after the novel failed to match the success of his debut effort, saying in 2012, &quot;I was very obsessive, very protective about that book, perhaps overly so.&quot;

His most controversial work is the graphically violent &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991), which he has said &quot;came out of a place of severe alienation and loneliness and self-loathing. I was pursuing a life—you could call it the &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; way of living—that I knew was bullshit, and yet I couldn&#x27;t seem to help it.&quot; The book was intended to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster, but they withdrew after external protests from groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and many others due to its alleged misogyny. It was later published by Vintage. Some consider this novel, whose protagonist, Patrick Bateman, is a cartoonishly materialistic yuppie and serial killer, an example of transgressive art. &quot;American Psycho&quot; has achieved considerable cult status.

Ellis&#x27;s collection of short stories &quot;The Informers&quot; was published in 1994. It contains vignettes of wayward Los Angeles characters ranging from rock stars to vampires, mostly written while Ellis was in college, and so has more in common with the style of &quot;Less than Zero.&quot; Ellis has said that the stories in &quot;The Informers&quot; were collected and released only to fulfill a contractual obligation after discovering that it would take far longer to complete his next novel than he&#x27;d intended. After years of struggling with it, he released his fourth novel, &quot;Glamorama&quot;, in 1998. &quot;Glamorama&quot; is set in the world of high fashion, following a male model who becomes entangled in a bizarre terrorist organization composed entirely of other models.

The book plays with themes of media, celebrity, and political violence, and like its predecessor &quot;American Psycho&quot; it uses surrealism to convey a sense of postmodern dread. Although reactions to the novel were mixed, Ellis holds it in high esteem among his own works: &quot;it&#x27;s probably the best novel I&#x27;ve written and the one that means the most to me. And when I say &quot;best&quot;—the wrong word, I suppose, but I&#x27;m not sure what else to replace it with—I mean that I&#x27;ll never have that energy again, that kind of focus sustained for eight years on a single project. I&#x27;ll never spend that amount of time crafting a book that means that much to me. And I think people who have read all of my work and are fans understand that about Glamorama—it&#x27;s the one book out of the seven I&#x27;ve published that matters the most.&quot; Ellis&#x27;s novel &quot;Lunar Park&quot; (2005) uses the form of a celebrity memoir to tell a ghost story about the novelist &quot;Bret Easton Ellis&quot; and his chilling experiences in the apparently haunted home he shares with his wife and son. In keeping with his usual style, Ellis mixes absurd comedy with a bleak and violent vision.

In 2010, Ellis released a follow-up to &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot;. Taking place 25 years after the events of &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, it combines that book&#x27;s ennui with the postmodernism of &quot;Lunar Park&quot;. It met with disappointing sales. For his original screenplay for the Paul Schrader-directed film &quot;The Canyons&quot;, Ellis won Best Screenplay at the 14th Melbourne Underground Film Festival, with the film also winning Best Foreign Film, Best Foreign Director and Best Female Actor, for Lindsay Lohan. Ellis released his first work of non-fiction, &quot;White,&quot; a collection of essays on contemporary political culture, in 2019.

In late 2020, Ellis began to serialize his latest work, a fictionalized memoir called &quot;The Shards&quot;, through his podcast. It focuses on his adolescence in Los Angeles and a serial killer called the Trawler. On December 1, 2021, he announced on Instagram that the manuscript of &quot;The Shards&quot; had just arrived for him to look over. On May 20, 2022, he announced that the book could be preordered. It was published on January 17, 2023.

===Fictional setting and recurring characters===
Ellis often uses recurring characters and settings. Major characters in one novel may become minor ones in the next, or vice versa. Camden College, a fictional New England liberal arts college, is frequently referenced. It is based on Bennington College, which Ellis attended, and where he met future novelist Jonathan Lethem and befriended fellow writers Donna Tartt and Jill Eisenstadt. In Tartt&#x27;s &quot;The Secret History&quot; (1992), her version of Bennington is &quot;Hampden College&quot;, although there are oblique connections between it and Ellis&#x27;s &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. Eisenstadt and Lethem use &quot;Camden&quot; in &quot;From Rockaway&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot; (2003), respectively. Though his three major settings are Vermont, Los Angeles and New York, Ellis has said he does not think of these novels as about these places specifically.

Camden is introduced in &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, which mentions that both protagonist Clay and minor character Daniel attend it. In &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (1987), set at Camden, Clay (called &quot;the Guy from L.A.&quot; before being properly introduced) is a minor character who narrates one chapter; ironically, he longs for the Californian beach, while in Ellis&#x27;s previous novel he had longed to return to college. On &quot;the guy from L.A.&#x27;s door someone wrote &#x27;Rest in Peace Called&#x27;&quot;; R.I.P., or Rip, is Clay&#x27;s dealer in &quot;Less than Zero&quot;; Clay also says that Blair from &quot;Less than Zero&quot; sent him a letter saying she thinks Rip was murdered. Main character Sean Bateman&#x27;s older brother Patrick narrates one chapter of the novel; he is the infamous central character of Ellis&#x27;s next novel, &quot;American Psycho&quot;. Bateman is a 27-year-old successful specialist in mergers and acquisitions with the fictitious Wall Street investment firm of Pierce &amp; Pierce (also Sherman McCoy&#x27;s firm in &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;).

Ellis also includes a reference to Tartt&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;Secret History&quot; in the form of a passing mention of &quot;that weird Classics group ... probably roaming the countryside sacrificing farmers and performing pagan rituals.&quot; There is also an allusion to the main character from Eisenstadt&#x27;s &quot;From Rockaway&quot;. In &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991), Patrick&#x27;s brother Sean appears briefly. Paul Denton and Victor Johnson from &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; are both mentioned; on seeing Paul, Patrick wonders if &quot;maybe he was on that cruise a long time ago, one night last March. If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;m thinking, I should get his telephone number or, better yet, his address.&quot; Camden is both Sean&#x27;s college and the college a minor character named Vanden is going to. Vanden was referred to (but never appeared) in both &quot;Less than Zero&quot; and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. Passages from &quot;Less than Zero&quot; reappear almost verbatim here, with Patrick replacing Clay as narrator. Patrick also makes repeated references to Jami Gertz, the actress who portrays Blair in the 1987 film adaptation of &quot;Less than Zero&quot;.

Allison Poole from Jay McInerney&#x27;s 1988 novel &quot;Story of My Life&quot; appears as a torture victim of Patrick&#x27;s. Patrick also briefly meets with the narrator from McInerney&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot; (who is referred to by his name in the 1988 movie adaptation). &quot;The Informers&quot; features a much younger Timothy Price, one of Patrick&#x27;s co-workers in &quot;American Psycho&quot;, who narrates one chapter. One of the central characters, Graham, buys concert tickets from &quot;Less than Zero&quot;″s Julian, and his sister Susan goes on to say that Julian sells heroin and is a male prostitute (as shown in &quot;Zero&quot;). Alana and Blair from &quot;Zero&quot; are also friends of Susan&#x27;s. Letters to Sean Bateman from a Camden College girl named Anne visiting grandparents in Los Angeles comprise the eighth chapter.

Bateman appears briefly in &quot;Glamorama&quot; (1998); &quot;Glamorama&quot;″s main characters Victor Ward and Lauren Hynde were first introduced in &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;. As an in-joke reference to Bateman being portrayed by Christian Bale in the then-in-production 2000 film adaptation, Bale briefly appears as a background character. The book also includes a spy named Russell who is physically identical to Bale, and at one point in the novel impersonates him. Jaime Fields, who has a major role in the book, was first briefly mentioned by Victor in &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;.

Bertrand, Sean and Mitchell, all from &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, appear in Camden flashbacks and several other &quot;Rules&quot; characters are referenced. McInerney&#x27;s Alison Poole makes her second appearance in an Ellis novel as Victor&#x27;s mistress. &quot;Lunar Park&quot; (2005) is not set in the same &quot;universe&quot; as Ellis&#x27;s other novels but contains a similar multitude of references and allusions. All of Ellis&#x27;s previous works are heavily referenced, in keeping with the book-within-a-book structure. Donald Kimball from &quot;American Psycho&quot; questions Ellis on a series of &quot;American Psycho&quot;-inspired murders, Mitchell Allen from &quot;Rules&quot; lives next door to and went to college with Ellis (Ellis even recalls his affair with Paul Denton, alluded to in &quot;Rules&quot;), and Ellis recalls a tempestuous relationship with Blair from &quot;Zero&quot;. &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot; (2010) establishes the conceit that the Clay depicted in &quot;Zero&quot; is not the same Clay who narrates &quot;Bedrooms&quot;. In the world of &quot;Imperial Bedrooms&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot; was the close-to-nonfiction work of an author friend of Clay&#x27;s, and its film adaptation (featuring actors Andrew McCarthy, Jami Gertz and Robert Downey Jr.) exists within the world of the novel, too.

===Adaptations===
In May 2014 Bravo announced that it had teamed up with &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; feature film adaptation writer/director Roger Avary and producer Greg Shapiro to develop a limited-run series based on the novel. The plot will stray from the source material and is described as follows: &quot;Inspired by the book and film of the same name, the high-concept series takes the students and faculty at the fictional Camden College and unravels a murder mystery by telling the same story through 12 different points of view. Children of the 1%-ers live as unhinged and wild adults in a Bret Easton Ellis world with seemingly no rules to hold these privileged few down.&quot; Titled &quot;Rules of Attraction&quot;, the series will be written by Roger Avary (&quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, &quot;Beowulf&quot;) for Lionsgate TV with Greg Shapiro (&quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot;) serving as an executive producer. In a 2013 interview with Film School Rejects, Ellis stated that he doesn&#x27;t think the original &quot;American Psycho&quot; &quot;really works as a film&quot;:American Psycho I also don&#x27;t think really works as a film. The movie is fine, but I think that book is unadaptable because it&#x27;s about consciousness, and you can&#x27;t really shoot that sensibility. Also, you have to make a decision whether Patrick Bateman kills people or doesn&#x27;t. Regardless of how [director] Mary Harron wants to shoot that ending, we&#x27;ve already seen him kill people; it doesn&#x27;t matter if he has some crisis of memory at the end.

On a 2014 appearance on the &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot; podcast, Ellis indicated that his feelings towards the film were more mixed than negative; he reiterated his opinion that his conception of Bateman as an unreliable narrator did not make an entirely successful transition from page to screen, adding that Bateman&#x27;s narration was so unreliable that even &quot;he&quot;, as the author of the book, did not know if Bateman was honestly describing events that actually happened or if he was lying or even hallucinating. Ellis appreciated that the film clarified the humor for audiences who mistook the novel&#x27;s violence for blatant misogyny as opposed to the deliberately exaggerated satire he had intended, and liked that it gave his novel &quot;a second life&quot; in introducing it to new readers. Ultimately, Ellis said &quot;the movie was okay, the movie was fine. I just didn&#x27;t think it needed to be made&quot;.

==Podcast==
On November 18, 2013, Ellis launched a podcast with PodcastOne Studios. The aim of the show, which comes in 1-hour segments, is to have Ellis engage in open and honest conversation with his guests about their work, inspirations, and life experiences, as well as music and movies. Ellis, who has always been averse to publicity, has been using the platform to engage in intellectual conversation and debate about his own observations on the media, the film industry, the music scene and the analog vs. digital age in a generational context.

Guests have included Kanye West, Marilyn Manson, Judd Apatow, Chuck Klosterman, Kevin Smith, Michael Ian Black, Matt Berninger, Brandon Boyd, B. J. Novak, Gus Van Sant, Joe Swanberg, Ezra Koenig, Ryan Leone, Stephen Malkmus, John Densmore, Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein, Matty Healy, Ivan Reitman, and Adam Carolla.
In April 2018 the Bret Easton Ellis Podcast began a Patreon for instant access to new episodes.

<text>Roger Roberts Avary (born August 23, 1965) is a Canadian-American film director, screenwriter and producer. He is best known for his work with Quentin Tarantino on the script for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), for which they won Best Original Screenplay at the 67th Academy Awards. Avary has also directed films such as &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (2002), and wrote the screenplays for &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (2006) and &quot;Beowulf&quot; (2007).

In 2022, Avary reunited with Tarantino to launch a podcast called &quot;The Video Archives Podcast&quot;. The first episode premiered on July 19, 2022.

== Early life ==
Roger Roberts Avary was born in Flin Flon, Manitoba, in Canada on August 23, 1965, to a Brazilian-raised father, who worked as a mining engineer, and a German mother, who worked as a physical therapist. They later moved to Oracle, Arizona, and later Torrance, California, before settling in Manhattan Beach.

==Career==
===1990s===
In 1993 Avary directed his feature film debut with &quot;Killing Zoe&quot;. The film follows an American safe-cracker (Eric Stoltz) who travels to Paris to aid a childhood friend (Jean-Hugues Anglade) with a bank heist. Along the way he meets and befriends a sex worker (Julie Delpy) whose fate becomes tied with the crime. The film premiered at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival and went on to win the Grand Prize award at the 5th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. 
Avary and Quentin Tarantino worked on the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, for which they won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. According to Tarantino, Avary originally came up with the plot of the boxer Butch Coolidge and his gold watch from a screenplay named &quot;Pandemonium Reigns&quot;, which Avary had written himself.

In 1995 Avary wrote and directed the science fiction film &quot;Mr. Stitch&quot; for Syfy, then The Sci-Fi Channel. Loosely a modern take on Frankenstein, the film features Wil Wheaton, Rutger Hauer, Nia Peeples, and Ron Perlman.

===2000s===
In 2002, Avary directed the film adaptation for &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot;, based on Bret Easton Ellis&#x27; novel, which he also executive produced. &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; was the first studio film to be edited on Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro editing system. Avary became a spokesperson for Final Cut Pro product, appearing in Apple print and web ads worldwide. In 2005, Avary, at the request of his friend, actor James Van Der Beek, played the part of a peyote-taking gonzo film director Franklin Brauner in the film &quot;Standing Still&quot;. The film &quot;Glitterati&quot; was finished in 2004 and stars Kip Pardue. It can never be released because of legal and ethical concerns.

In 2006, Avary wrote a screenplay adaptation to the Konami video game, &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (2006), with French director and friend, Christophe Gans, and &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; producer Samuel Hadida. Avary and Gans being long time gamers and fans of the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series, collaborated on the film. Avary and novelist Neil Gaiman wrote the screenplay for the 2007 film &quot;Beowulf&quot; which was directed by Robert Zemeckis.

===2010s and 2020s===
In September 2017 Avary directed his own screenplay, &quot;Lucky Day&quot;, a semi-sequel of &quot;Killing Zoe.&quot; In 2018 he shot an adaptation of Jean Cocteau&#x27;s play &quot;La voix humaine&quot; that remains unreleased.

After &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Avary had a falling-out with Tarantino that lasted nearly twenty-five years. The two rekindled their friendship after Tarantino heard Avary being interviewed on a 2019 episode of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s podcast. In 2021, Quentin Tarantino announced that he and Avary would launch a podcast titled &quot;The Video Archives Podcast&quot;. The point of the podcast is to discuss films from the actual Video Archives collection that they would recommend to customers when they worked there. The set is surrounded by actual VHS copies of films from Video Archives that Tarantino bought after the store went out of business. They are joined by podcast announcer, Gala Avary, Roger Avary&#x27;s daughter. The first episode premiered on July 19, 2022. The duo discussed John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Dark Star&quot; (1974) and Ulli Lommel&#x27;s &quot;Cocaine Cowboys&quot; (1979).

===Unproduced works===
After winning an Oscar for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, he was originally attached to direct an adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book &quot;The Sandman&quot;, which merged the &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; storyline with that of &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot;. Avary was fired after disagreements over the creative direction with executive producer Jon Peters. It was due to their meeting on the &quot;Sandman&quot; film project that Avary and Gaiman collaborated on the script for &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Avary had originally intended upon directing his script of &quot;Beowulf&quot; himself as a live action film, to be shot in Iceland with a $10 million budget. &quot;I wanted it to be like an early Terry Gilliam film, like &quot;Jabberwocky&quot;,&quot; he said. The film was ultimately directed by Robert Zemeckis and instead produced using motion capture technology.

In the late 1990s, Avary reached out to Don Coscarelli and expressed an interest in writing a &quot;Phantasm&quot; sequel. Entitled &quot; Phantasm 1999&quot;, the film would have taken place in an apocalyptic future United States divided into three zones: Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; and the Plague Zone. The Plague Zone would be controlled by the Tall Man where he infects people with his &quot;bag plague&quot;. Reggie must lead a secret government operation, called the &quot;S Squad&quot;, into the Plague Zone to defeat the Tall Man. Avary and Coscarelli spent years trying to get the film made and even had financing in place in 1997 before that company changed hands and the deal evaporated. Eventually, Coscarelli made &quot;Phantasm IV&quot; without Avary, although as of 2022 Coscarelli still had interest in filming Avary&#x27;s script, now entitled &quot;Phantasm’s End&quot; as 1999 has come and gone.

Through the 90s and early 2000s Avary attempted to direct a film based on the life of Salvador Dalí that had Al Pacino attached to star as the painter at one stage, but the project fell apart and never came to fruition.

After &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; and &quot;Glitterati&quot;, Avary had intentions to film his screenplay of Bret Easton Ellis&#x27;s 1998 novel &quot;Glamorama&quot;. Kip Pardue was attached to reprise his role as Victor Ward. The project never moved beyond the pre-production stage. When asked about the film&#x27;s status in a 2010 interview, Ellis said: &quot;I think the days of being able to make that movie are over.&quot; However, the following year Ellis confirmed that Avary was planning to shoot the feature in 2012.

In 2006, French director Alexandre Aja was set to direct a feature film adaptation of the &quot;Black Hole&quot; comics, with Neil Gaiman and Avary attached to adapt the screenplay. By 2008, it was reported by MTV that Gaiman and Avary had left the production and that their script would not be used for David Fincher&#x27;s planned version, which was ultimately not produced. He was also attached to write and direct a &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot; film adaptation both in 2007 and 2012.

While in prison, Avary came across an &quot;old Penguin paperback&quot; on a book cart of a &quot;Robin Hood&quot; story written by E. Charles Vivian and decided to adapt the material, sending the pages he wrote to his lawyer to have his daughter type up into a script. &quot;I was crying when I wrote it,&quot; Avary noted. &quot;When you&#x27;re writing like that and you&#x27;re feeling that much, it&#x27;s not a bad thing.&quot;

Following his prison sentence, Avary had worked on adapting Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s book &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; for Verhoeve to direct, oversaw rewrites on the screenplay for a planned Duncan Jones-directed biopic on &quot;James Bond&quot; creator Ian Fleming, and additionally had plans to adapt the early William Faulkner novel &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. Also in 2012, Avary was planning to reteam with author Bret Easton Ellis to direct an adaptation of his novel &quot;Lunar Park&quot;, with financing from Wild Bunch. Ellis himself took to Twitter in 2011, praising Avary&#x27;s script as &quot;great&quot; and saying he &quot;hopes he makes it.&quot; Also according to Ellis, Avary planned to shoot the project in September 2012, and hinted about Aaron Eckhart&#x27;s potential involvement.

At some point after John Milius&#x27; stroke, Avary, along with his daughter Gala, worked with Milius to retool his unproduced feature script on Genghis Khan in the form of a limited-run series. As of 2018, Avary was slated to direct &quot;Unwind&quot;, co-written with his daughter Gala and based on the dystopian novel of the same name. Avary has also written an as-yet unproduced script based on &quot;The Devil Soldier&quot; by Caleb Carr, which was in development with Antoine Fuqua directing and Mark Burman producing.

==Manslaughter conviction ==
On January 13, 2008, Avary was arrested under suspicion of manslaughter and DUI, following a car crash in Ojai, California, in which his passenger, Andreas Zini, was killed. The Ventura County Sheriff&#x27;s department responded to the crash after midnight Sunday morning on the 1900 block of East Ojai Avenue. Avary was released from jail on $50,000 bail. In December 2008, he was charged with, and pleaded not guilty to, gross vehicular manslaughter and two felony counts of causing bodily injury while intoxicated. He changed his plea to guilty on August 18, 2009. On September 29, 2009, he was sentenced to one year in work furlough (allowing him to go to his job during the day and then report back to the furlough facility at night) and five years of probation. However, after making several tweets about the conditions of his stay on Twitter, Avary was sent to Ventura County Jail to serve out the remainder of his term.

<text>The East China Sea is a marginal sea of the Western Pacific Ocean, located directly offshore from East China. China names the body of water along its eastern coast as &quot;East Sea&quot; (, ) due to direction, the name of &quot;East China Sea&quot; is otherwise designated as a formal name by International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and used internationally.

It covers an area of roughly . The sea&#x27;s northern extension between Korean Peninsula and mainland China is the Yellow Sea, separated by an imaginary line between the southwestern tip of South Korea&#x27;s Jeju Island and the eastern tip of Qidong at the Yangtze River estuary. 

The East China Sea is bounded in the east and southeast by the middle portion of the first island chain off the eastern Eurasian continental mainland, including the Japanese island of Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands, and in the south by the island of Taiwan. It connects with the Sea of Japan in the northeast through the Korea Strait, the South China Sea in the southwest via the Taiwan Strait, and the Philippine Sea in the southeast via gaps between the various Ryukyu Islands (e.g. Tokara Strait and Miyako Strait).

Most of the East China Sea is shallow, with almost three-fourths of it being less than deep, its average depth being , while the maximum depth, reached in the Okinawa Trough, is .

The Korean peninsula, China, Japan, and Taiwan lie within or border the East China Sea.

==Geography==
The East China Sea is an arm of the Pacific Ocean and covers an area of roughly . It is bounded on the east by Kyūshū and the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, on the south by the South China Sea, and on the west by the Asian continent. It connects with the Sea of Japan through the Korea Strait; it opens in the north to the Yellow Sea.

Countries with borders on the sea (clockwise from north) include: South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the &quot;Eastern China Sea (Tung Hai)&quot; as follows:

::&quot;On the South.&quot;
:::The Northern limit of the South China Sea [From Fuki Kaku the North point of Formosa to Kiushan Tao (Turnabout Island) on to the South point of Haitan Tao (25°25&#x27; N) and thence Westward on the parallel of 25°24&#x27; North to the coast of Fukien], thence from Santyo the Northeastern point of Formosa to the West point of Yonakuni Island and thence to Haderuma Sima (24°03′ N, 123°47′ E).
::&quot;On the East.&quot;
:::From Haderuma Sima a line including the Miyako Retto to the East point of Miyako Sima and thence to Okinan Kaku, the Southern extremity of Okinawa Sima through this island to Ada-Ko Sima (Sidmouth Island) on to the East point of Kikai Sima (28°20&#x27; N) through Tanegra Sima (30°30&#x27; N) to the North point thereof and on to Hi-Saki (31°17&#x27; N) in Kyusyu.
::&quot;On the North.&quot;
:::From Nomo Saki (32°35&#x27; N) in Kyusyu to the South point of Hukae Sima (Goto Retto) and on through this island to Ose Saki (Cape Goto) and to Hunan Kan, the South point of Saisyu To (Quelpart), through this island to its Western extreme and thence along the parallel of 33°17&#x27; North to the mainland.
::&quot;On the West.&quot;
:::The mainland of China.

===Rivers===
The Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) is the largest river flowing into the East China Sea.

===Islands and reefs===
*Tong Island

There is a cluster of submerged reefs in the northern East China Sea. These include:

*Socotra Rock, also called Suyan Rock or Ieodo, a subject of an EEZ dispute between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and South Korea.
*Hupijiao Rock ()
*Yajiao Rock ()

==Nomenclature==
The sea is called the East Sea in Chinese (; &quot;Dōng Hǎi&quot;), and is one of the Four Seas of Chinese literature. There are three other seas, one for each of the four cardinal directions.

Until World War II, the sea was referred to as (&quot;Higashi Shina Kai&quot;; &quot;East Shina Sea&quot;) in Japanese. In 2004, official documents of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and other departments switched to the name (pronounced the same), which has become the standard usage in Japan.

Common usage in Indonesia refers to the sea as &quot;Laut Cina Timur&quot; (East China Sea). This name was used officially by the Indonesian government until 2014, when Indonesia switched usage from the word Cina to Tiongkok instead; since then, the name &quot;Laut Tiongkok Timur&quot; become standard usage in Indonesia. Despite this, many Indonesian media outlets and publications continue to use the former sea name.

==History==

===Whaling===
American whaleships cruised for right whales in the sea between 1849 and 1892.

===EEZ disputes===

There are disputes between the China] (PRC), Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea over the extent of their respective exclusive economic zones (EEZ).

The dispute between the PRC and Japan concerns the different application of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which both nations have ratified. China and Japan both claim 200 nautical miles EEZ rights, but the East China Sea width is only 360 nautical miles. China proposed the application of UNCLOS, considering the natural prolongation of its continental shelf, advocating that the EEZ extends as far as the Okinawa Trough. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated that &quot;the natural prolongation of the continental shelf of China in the East China Sea extends to the Okinawa Trough and beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea of China is measured,&quot; which is applicable to the relevant UNCLOS provisions that support China&#x27;s right to the natural shelf. In 2012, China presented a submission under the UNCLOS concerning the outer limits of the continental shelf to the UN. However, Japan claims about 40,000 square kilometers part of this territory as its own EEZ because it is within 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its coast, and thus proposed the Median line division of the EEZ.

 In 1995, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) discovered an undersea natural gas field in the East China Sea, namely the Chunxiao gas field, which lies within the Chinese EEZ while Japan believes it is connected to other possible reserves beyond the median line. Japan has objected to PRC development of natural gas resources in the East China Sea near the area where the two countries Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims overlap. The specific development in dispute is the PRC&#x27;s drilling in the Chunxiao gas field, which is located in undisputed areas on China&#x27;s side, three or four miles (6 km) west of the median line proposed by Japan. Japan maintains that although the Chunxiao gas field rigs are on the PRC side of a median line that Tokyo regards as the two sides&#x27; sea boundary, they may tap into a field that stretches underground into the disputed area. Japan therefore seeks a share in the natural gas resources. The gas fields in the Xihu Sag area in the East China Sea (Canxue, Baoyunting, Chunxiao, Duanqiao, Wuyunting, and Tianwaitian) are estimated to hold proven reserves of 364 BCF of natural gas. Commercial operations began 2006. In June 2008, both sides agreed to jointly develop the Chunxiao gas fields, but they have never been able to agree on how to execute the plan.

Rounds of disputes about island ownership in the East China Sea have triggered both official and civilian protests between China and Japan.
The dispute between PRC and South Korea concerns Socotra Rock, a submerged reef on which South Korea has constructed the Ieodo Ocean Research Station. While neither country claims the rock as territory, the PRC has objected to Korean activities there as a breach of its EEZ rights.

===Navy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC)===

In their sphere of naval operations along their littoral (in the East and South China Seas), China today possesses more naval vessels than those of the US Navy. US Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump have given priority to US naval operations, under the US Indo-Pacific Command, to expand its sphere of influence in the Pacific Ocean, to counter China&#x27;s growing strength, and to be ready for any unforeseen challenges in the future. 

The role of the Chinese Navy in the East China Sea is important, especially in territorial disputes such as the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands issue. China has expanded its naval involvement in the area by sending out naval ships and carrying out maritime patrols to uphold its ownership of contested lands. This increased naval presence demonstrates China&#x27;s strategic priority to safeguard maritime routes, defend territorial claims, and show strength in the East China Sea. The Chinese Navy&#x27;s activities in the area impact the naval strategies of neighboring countries and shape maritime cooperation initiatives, contributing to wider regional security dynamics. Moreover, the involvement of the Chinese Navy highlights the intricate relationship among maritime security, territorial conflicts, and competition among major powers in the Asia-Pacific area.

=== Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) ===
The Maritime Self-Defense Force of Japan (MSDF) is highly important in the East China Sea, particularly in relation to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands conflict. Japan has improved its abilities at sea by increasing naval patrols and surveillance in order to protect its territorial rights and monitor activities in the region. The MSDF being there highlights Japan&#x27;s dedication to safeguarding its territorial waters, ensuring maritime security, and upholding international law when dealing with maritime disagreements. Additionally, Japan also plays a wider role in regional security cooperation by engaging in joint naval drills with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region. The actions of the MSDF in the East China Sea help promote stability, build confidence, and deter security threats, showcasing Japan&#x27;s active stance on maritime security and defense in the Asia-Pacific region.

=== Republic of China Navy ===
Taiwan&#x27;s involvement in the East China Sea is influenced by its territorial disputes and strategic concerns, especially in relation to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands conflict. Although Taiwan claims ownership of the islands, its maritime actions in the area are not as extensive as those of China and Japan. Taiwan keeps a Coast Guard presence for patrolling its waters and dealing with maritime incidents. Still, Taiwan&#x27;s involvement in the East China Sea is impacted by its larger security concerns and its relations with China across the strait. The tensions over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands impact Taiwan&#x27;s security outlook and regional stability, leading to a need for close monitoring of maritime activities and continued diplomatic communication with relevant parties. Even though Taiwan&#x27;s involvement in the East China Sea conflict is limited, its position demonstrates its dedication to defending its territorial rights and promoting maritime safety in the Asia-Pacific area.

== Military activities ==
Taiwan, Japan, China, and South Korea all conduct military exercises in the East China Sea.

==East China Sea in astronomy==
Possibly, East China Sea (&quot;Donghai&quot; in Chinese) is represented with the star Eta Serpentis in asterism &quot;Left Wall&quot;, Heavenly Market enclosure (see Chinese constellation).

<text>Anonymity describes situations where the acting person&#x27;s identity is unknown. Some writers have argued that namelessness, though technically correct, does not capture what is more centrally at stake in contexts of anonymity. The important idea here is that a person be non-identifiable, unreachable, or untrackable. Anonymity is seen as a technique, or a way of realizing, a certain other values, such as privacy, or liberty. Over the past few years, anonymity tools used on the dark web by criminals and malicious users have drastically altered the ability of law enforcement to use conventional surveillance techniques.

An important example for anonymity being not only protected, but enforced by law is the vote in free elections. In many other situations (like conversation between strangers, buying some product or service in a shop), anonymity is traditionally accepted as natural. There are also various situations in which a person might choose to withhold their identity. Acts of charity have been performed anonymously when benefactors do not wish to be acknowledged. A person who feels threatened might attempt to mitigate that threat through anonymity. A witness to a crime might seek to avoid retribution, for example, by anonymously calling a crime tipline. Criminals might proceed anonymously to conceal their participation in a crime. Anonymity may also be created unintentionally, through the loss of identifying information due to the passage of time or a destructive event.

In certain situations, however, it may be illegal to remain anonymous. For example, 24 of the U.S. states have &quot;stop and identify&quot; statutes that require persons detained to self-identify when requested by a law enforcement officer, when the person is reasonably suspected of committing a crime.

The term &quot;anonymous message&quot; typically refers to a message that does not reveal its sender. In many countries, anonymous letters are protected by law and must be delivered as regular letters.

In mathematics, in reference to an arbitrary element (e.g., a human, an object, a computer), within a well-defined set (called the &quot;anonymity set&quot;), &quot;anonymity&quot; of that element refers to the property of that element of not being identifiable within this set. If it is not identifiable, then the element is said to be &quot;anonymous&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word anonymous was borrowed into English around 1600 from the Late Latin word &quot;anonymus&quot;, from Ancient Greek ᾰ̓νώνῠμος (anṓnumos, &quot;without name&quot;), from ᾰ̓ν- (an-, &quot;un-&quot;) with ὄνῠμᾰ (ónuma), Aeolic and Doric dialectal form of ὄνομᾰ (ónoma, &quot;name&quot;).

==Pseudonymity==
Sometimes a person may desire a long-term relationship (such as a reputation) with another party without necessarily disclosing personally identifying information to that party. In this case, it may be useful for the person to establish a unique identifier, called a pseudonym. Examples of pseudonyms are pen names, nicknames, credit card numbers, student numbers, bank account numbers, etc. A pseudonym enables the other party to link different messages from the same person and, thereby, to establish a long-term relationship. Pseudonyms are widely used in social networks and other virtual communication, although recently some important service providers like Google try to discourage pseudonymity.
Someone using a pseudonym would be strictly considered to be using &quot;pseudonymity&quot; not &quot;anonymity&quot;, but sometimes the latter is used to refer to both (in general, a situation where the legal identity of the person is disguised).

==Psychological effects==
Anonymity may reduce the accountability one perceives to have for their actions, and removes the impact these actions might otherwise have on their reputation. This can have dramatic effects, both useful and harmful to various parties involved. Thus, it may be used for psychological tactics involving any respective party to purport or support or discredit any sort of activity or belief.

In conversational settings, anonymity may allow people to reveal personal history and feelings without fear of later embarrassment. Electronic conversational media can provide physical isolation, in addition to anonymity. This prevents physical retaliation for remarks, and prevents negative or taboo behavior or discussion from tarnishing the reputation of the speaker. This can be beneficial when discussing very private matters, or taboo subjects or expressing views or revealing facts that may put someone in physical, financial, or legal danger (such as illegal activity, or unpopular, or outlawed political views).

In work settings, the three most common forms of anonymous communication are traditional suggestion boxes, written feedback, and Caller ID blocking. Additionally, the appropriateness of anonymous organizational communication varies depending on the use, with organizational surveys or assessments typically perceived as highly appropriate and firing perceived as highly inappropriate. Anonymity use and appropriateness have also been found to be significantly related to the quality of relationships with key others at work.
With few perceived negative consequences, anonymous or semi-anonymous forums often provide a soapbox for disruptive conversational behavior. The term &quot;troll&quot; is sometimes used to refer to those who engage in such disruptive behavior.

Relative anonymity is often enjoyed in large crowds. Different people have different psychological and philosophical reactions to this development, especially as a modern phenomenon. This anonymity is an important factor in crowd psychology, and behavior in situations such as a riot. This perceived anonymity can be compromised by technologies such as photography. Groupthink behavior and conformity are also considered to be an established effect of internet anonymity.

Anonymity also permits highly trained professionals such as judges to freely express themselves regarding the strategies they employ to perform their jobs objectively.

==Anonymity, commerce, and crime==
Anonymous commercial transactions can protect the privacy of consumers. Some consumers prefer to use cash when buying everyday goods (like groceries or tools), to prevent sellers from aggregating information or soliciting them in the future. Credit cards are linked to a person&#x27;s name, and can be used to discover other information, such as postal address, phone number, etc. The ecash system was developed to allow secure anonymous transactions. Another example would be Enymity, which actually makes a purchase on a customer&#x27;s behalf. When purchasing taboo goods and services, anonymity makes many potential consumers more comfortable with or more willing to engage in the transaction. Many loyalty programs use cards that personally identify the consumer engaging in each transaction (possibly for later solicitation, or for redemption or security purposes), or that act as a numerical pseudonym, for use in data mining.

Anonymity can also be used as a protection against legal prosecution. For example, when committing unlawful actions, many criminals attempt to avoid identification by the means of obscuring/covering their faces with scarves or masks, and wear gloves or other hand coverings in order to not leave any fingerprints. In organized crime, groups of criminals may collaborate on a certain project without revealing to each other their names or other personally identifiable information. The movie &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; depicted a fictional collaboration by people who had never previously met and did not know who had recruited them. The anonymous purchase of a gun or knife to be used in a crime helps prevent linking an abandoned weapon to the identity of the perpetrator.

==Anonymity in charity==
There are two aspects, one, giving to a large charitable organization obscures the beneficiary of a donation from the benefactor, the other is giving anonymously to obscure the benefactor both from the beneficiary and from everyone else.

Anonymous charity has long been a widespread and durable moral precept of many ethical and religious systems, as well as being in practice a widespread human activity. A benefactor may not wish to establish any relationship with the beneficiary, particularly if the beneficiary is perceived as being unsavory. Benefactors may not wish to identify themselves as capable of giving. A benefactor may wish to improve the world, as long as no one knows who did it, out of modesty, wishing to avoid publicity. Another reason for anonymous charity is a benefactor who does not want a charitable organization to pursue them for more donations, sometimes aggressively.

==Issues facing the anonymous==
Attempts at anonymity are not always met with support from society.

Anonymity sometimes clashes with the policies and procedures of governments or private organizations. In the United States, disclosure of identity is required to be able to vote, though the secret ballot prevents disclosure of individual voting patterns. In airports in most countries, passengers are not allowed to board flights unless they have identified themselves to airline or transportation security personnel, typically in the form of the presentation of an identification card.

On the other hand, some policies and procedures require anonymity.

Stylometric identification of anonymous authors by writing style is a potential risk, which is expected to grow as analytic techniques improve and computing power and text corpora grow. Authors may resist such identification by practicing adversarial stylometry.

==Referring to the anonymous==
When it is necessary to refer to someone who is anonymous, it is typically necessary to create a type of pseudo-identification for that person. In literature, the most common way to state that the identity of an author is unknown is to refer to them as simply &quot;Anonymous&quot;. This is usually the case with older texts in which the author is long dead and unable to claim authorship of a work. When the work claims to be that of some famous author the pseudonymous author is identified as &quot;Pseudo-&quot;, as in Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, an author claiming—and long believed—to be Dionysius the Areopagite, an early Christian convert.

&quot;Anonymus&quot;, in its Latin spelling, generally with a specific city designation, is traditionally used by scholars in the humanities to refer to an ancient writer whose name is not known, or to a manuscript of their work. Many such writers have left valuable historical or literary records: an incomplete list of such &quot;Anonymi&quot; is at Anonymus.

In the history of art, many painting workshops can be identified by their characteristic style and discussed and the workshop&#x27;s output set in chronological order. Sometimes archival research later identifies the name, as when the &quot;Master of Flémalle&quot;—defined by three paintings in the Städelsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt— was identified as Robert Campin. The 20th-century art historian Bernard Berenson methodically identified numerous early Renaissance Florentine and Sienese workshops under such sobriquets as &quot;Amico di Sandro&quot; for an anonymous painter in the immediate circle of Sandro Botticelli.

In legal cases, a popularly accepted name to use when it is determined that an individual needs to maintain anonymity is &quot;John Doe&quot;. This name is often modified to &quot;Jane Doe&quot; when the anonymity-seeker is female. The same names are also commonly used when the identification of a dead person is not known. The semi-acronym Unsub is used as law enforcement slang for &quot;Unknown Subject of an Investigation&quot;.

The military often feels a need to honor the remains of soldiers for whom identification is impossible. In many countries, such a memorial is named the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

==Anonymity and the press==
Most modern newspapers and magazines attribute their articles to individual editors, or to news agencies. An exception is the Markker weekly &quot;The Economist.&quot; All British newspapers run their leaders, or editorials, anonymously. &quot;The Economist&quot; fully adopts this policy, saying &quot;Many hands write &quot;The Economist&quot;, but it speaks with a collective voice&quot;. Guardian considers that &quot;people will often speak more honestly if they are allowed to speak anonymously&quot;. According to Ross Eaman, in his book &quot;The A to Z of Journalism&quot;, until the mid-19th century, most writers in Great Britain, especially the less well known, did not sign their names to their work in newspapers, magazines and reviews.

==Anonymity on the Internet== 

Most commentary on the Internet is essentially done anonymously, using unidentifiable pseudonyms. However this has been widely discredited in a study by the University of Birmingham, which found that the number of people who use the internet anonymously is statistically the same as the number of people who use the internet to interact with friends or known contacts. While these usernames can take on an identity of their own, they are sometimes separated and anonymous from the actual author. According to the University of Stockholm this is creating more freedom of expression, and less accountability. Wikipedia is collaboratively written mostly by authors using either unidentifiable pseudonyms or IP address identifiers, although many Wikipedia editors use their real names instead of pseudonyms.

However, the Internet was not designed for anonymity: IP addresses serve as virtual mailing addresses, which means that any time any resource on the Internet is accessed, it is accessed from a particular IP address, and the data traffic patterns to and from IP addresses can be intercepted, monitored, and analysed, even if the content of that traffic is encrypted. This address can be mapped to a particular Internet Service Provider (ISP), and this ISP can then provide information about what customer that IP address was leased to. This does not necessarily implicate a specific individual (because other people could be using that customer&#x27;s connection, especially if the customer is a public resource, such as a library), but it provides regional information and serves as powerful circumstantial evidence.

Anonymizing services such as I2P and Tor address the issue of IP tracking. In short, they work by encrypting packets within multiple layers of encryption. The packet follows a predetermined route through the anonymizing network. Each router sees the immediate previous router as the origin and the immediate next router as the destination. Thus, no router ever knows both the true origin and destination of the packet. This makes these services more secure than centralized anonymizing services (where a central point of knowledge exists).

Sites such as Chatroulette, Omegle, and Tinder (which pair up random users for a conversation) capitalized on a fascination with anonymity. Apps like Yik Yak, Secret and Whisper let people share things anonymously or quasi-anonymously whereas Random let the user to explore the web anonymously. Some email providers, like Tuta also offer the ability to create anonymous email accounts which do not require any personal information from the account holder. Other sites, however, including Facebook and Google+, ask users to sign in with their legal names. In the case of Google+, this requirement led to a controversy known as the nymwars. 

The prevalence of cyberbullying is often attributed to relative Internet anonymity, due to the fact that potential offenders are able to mask their identities and prevent themselves from being caught. A principal in a high school stated that comments made on these anonymous site are &quot;especially vicious and hurtful since there is no way to trace their source and it can be disseminated widely. &quot;Cyberbullying, as opposed to general bullying, is still a widely-debated area of Internet freedom in several states.

Though Internet anonymity can provide a harmful environment through which people can hurt others, anonymity can allow for a much safer and relaxed internet experience. In a study conducted at Carnegie Mellon University, 15 out of 44 participants stated that they choose to be anonymous online because of a prior negative experience during which they did not maintain an anonymous presence. Such experiences include stalking, releasing private information by an opposing school political group, or tricking an individual into traveling to another country for a job that did not exist. Participants in this study stated that they were able to avoid their previous problems by using false identification online.

David Chaum is called the Godfathers of anonymity and he has a claim to be one of the great visionaries of contemporary science. In the early 1980s, while a computer scientist at Berkeley, Chaum predicted the world in which computer networks would make mass surveillance a possibility. As Dr. Joss Wright explains: &quot;David Chaum was very ahead of his time. He predicted in the early 1980s concerns that would arise on the internet 15 or 20 years later.&quot; There are some people though that consider anonymity in internet being a danger for our society as a whole. David Davenport, an assistant professor in the Computer Engineering Department of Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey, considers that by allowing anonymous Net communication, the fabric of our society is at risk. &quot;Accountability requires those responsible for any misconduct be identified and brought to justice. However, if people remain anonymous, by definition, they cannot be identified, making it impossible to hold them accountable.&quot; he says.

=== Arguments for and against anonymity ===
As A. Michael Froomkin says: &quot;The regulation of anonymous and pseudonymous communications promises to be one of the most important and contentious Internet-related issues of the next decade&quot;. Anonymity and pseudonymity can be used for good and bad purposes. And anonymity can in many cases be desirable for one person and not desirable for another person. A company may, for example, not like an employee to divulge information about improper practices within the company, but society as a whole may find it important that such improper practices are publicly exposed.
Good purposes of anonymity and pseudonymity:
* People dependent on an organization, or afraid of revenge, may divulge serious misuse, which should be revealed. Anonymous tips can be used as an information source by newspapers, as well as by police departments, soliciting tips aimed at catching criminals. Not everyone will regard such anonymous communication as good. For example, message boards established outside companies, but for employees of such companies to vent their opinions on their employer, have sometimes been used in ways that at least the companies themselves were not happy about [Abelson 2001]. Police use of anonymity is a complex issue, since the police often will want to know the identity of the tipper in order to get more information, evaluate the reliability or get the tipper as a witness. Is it ethical for police to identify the tipper if it has opened up an anonymous tipping hotline?
* People in a country with a repressive political regime may use anonymity (for example Internet-based anonymity servers in other countries) to avoid persecution for their political opinions. Note that even in democratic countries, some people claim, rightly or wrongly, that certain political opinions are persecuted. [Wallace 1999] gives an overview of uses of anonymity to protect political speech. Every country has a limit on which political opinions are allowed, and there are always people who want to express forbidden opinions, like racial agitation in most democratic countries.
* People may openly discuss personal stuff which would be embarrassing to tell many people about, such as sexual problems. Research shows that anonymous participants disclose significantly more information about themselves [Joinson 2001]. People might also feel more open to sharing their personal work anonymously if they feel that their friends and family would harass them or disapprove of their work. Examples of such work could include fan fiction or vocal performances.
* People may get more objective evaluation of their messages, by not showing their real name.
* People are more equal in anonymous discussions, factors like status, gender, etc., will not influence the evaluation of what they say.
* Pseudonymity can be used to experiment with role playing, for example a man posing as a woman in order to understand the feelings of people of different gender.
* Pseudonymity can be a tool for timid people to dare establish contacts which can be of value for them and others, e.g. through contact advertisements.
* People can contribute to online social discussion with reduced risk of harm by online predators. Online predators include &quot;criminals, hackers, scammers, stalkers, and malicious online vendors&quot;.
* People can avoid becoming famous by publishing their work anonymously.

There has always, however, also been a negative side of anonymity:
* Anonymity can be used to protect a criminal performing many different crimes, for example slander, distribution of child pornography, illegal threats, racial agitation, fraud, intentional damage such as distribution of computer viruses, etc. The exact set of illegal acts varies from country to country, but most countries have many laws forbidding certain &quot;informational&quot; acts, everything from high treason to instigation of rebellion, etc., to swindling.
* Anonymity can be used for online payments for criminals paying others to perform illegal acts or purchases.
* Anonymity can be used to seek contacts for performing illegal acts, like a Child grooming searching for children to abuse or a swindler searching for people to rip off.
* Even when the act is not illegal, anonymity can be used for offensive or disruptive communication. For example, some people use anonymity in order to say harmful things about other people, known as cyberbullying.
* Internet trolls use anonymity to harm discussions in online social platforms.

The border between illegal and legal but offensive use is not very sharp, and varies depending on the law in each country.

=== Anonymous (group) ===
Anonymous (used as a mass noun) is a loosely associated international network of activist and hacktivist entities. A website nominally associated with the group describes it as &quot;an internet gathering&quot; with &quot;a very loose and decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives&quot;. The group became known for a series of well-publicized publicity stunts and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on government, religious, and corporate websites. An image commonly associated with Anonymous is the &quot;man without a head&quot; represents leaderless organization and anonymity.

==Legal protection of anonymity==
Anonymity is perceived as a right by many, especially the anonymity in the internet communications. The partial right for anonymity is legally protected to various degrees in different jurisdictions.

===United States===
The tradition of anonymous speech is older than the United States. Founders Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Publius&quot; and &quot;the Federal Farmer&quot; spoke up in rebuttal. The US Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized rights to speak anonymously derived from the First Amendment.
* The right to &quot;anonymous political campaigning&quot; was established in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission&quot; (1995) case: &quot;Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority...It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation—and their ideas from suppression—at the hand of an intolerant society&quot;. The Supreme court explained that protecting anonymous political speech receives the highest protection however, this priority takes on new dimensions in the digital age.
* The right of individuals for &quot;anonymous communication&quot; was established by the decision in case &quot;Columbia Insurance Company v. Seescandy.com, et al.&quot; (1999) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California: &quot;People are permitted to interact pseudonymously and anonymously with each other so long as those acts are not in violation of the law&quot;.
* The right of individuals for &quot;anonymous reading&quot; was established in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;United States v. Rumely&quot; (1953): &quot;Once the government can demand of a publisher the names of the purchasers of his publications, the free press as we know it disappears. Then the spectre of a government agent will look over the shoulder of everyone who reads&quot;.

The pressure on anonymous communication has grown substantially after the 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center and the subsequent new political climate. Although it is still difficult to oversee their exact implications, measures such as the US Patriot Act, the European Cybercrime Convention and the European Union rules on data retention are only few of the signs that the exercise of the right to the anonymous exchange of information is under substantial pressure.

An above-mentioned 1995 Supreme Court ruling in &quot;McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission&quot; reads: &quot;(...) protections for anonymous speech are vital to democratic discourse. Allowing dissenters to shield their identities frees them to express critical minority views . . . Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority. . . . It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation . . . at the hand of an intolerant society.&quot;

However, anonymous online speech is not without limits. It is clearly demonstrated in a case from 2008, one in which the defendant stated on a law-school discussion board that two women should be raped, an anonymous poster&#x27;s comments may extend beyond free speech protections. In the case, a Connecticut federal court must apply a standard to decide whether the poster&#x27;s identity should be revealed. There are several tests, however, that the court could apply when considering this issue.

===European Union===
The right to internet anonymity is also covered by European legislation that recognizes the fundamental right to data protection, freedom of expression, freedom of impression. The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights recognizes in Article. 8 (Title II: &quot;Freedoms&quot;) the right of everyone to protection of personal data concerning him. The right to privacy is now essentially the individual&#x27;s right to have and to maintain control over information about him.

===International legislation===
One of the most controversial international legal acts, regarding this subject is Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). As of February 2015, the treaty was signed -but not all ratified- by 31 states as well as the European Union. Japan was on 4 October 2012 the first to ratify the treaty. It creates an international regime for imposing civil and criminal penalties on Internet counterfeiting and copyright infringement. Although ACTA is intentionally vague, leaving signatories to draw precise rules themselves, critics say it could mean innocent travellers having their laptops searched for unlicensed music, or being jailed for carrying a generic drug. Infringers could be liable for the total loss of potential sales (implying that everyone who buys a counterfeit product would have bought the real thing). It applies to unintentional use of copyright material. It puts the onus on website owners to ensure they comply with laws across several territories. It has been negotiated secretively and outside established international trade bodies, despite EU criticisms.

==Anonymity and politics==

The history of anonymous expression in political dissent is both long and with important effect, as in the Letters of Junius or Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;, or scurrilous as in pasquinades. In the tradition of anonymous British political criticism, &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot; were anonymously authored by three of America&#x27;s Founding Fathers. Without the public discourse on the controversial contents of the U.S. Constitution, ratification would likely have taken much longer as individuals worked through the issues. The United States Declaration of Independence, however, was not anonymous. If it had been unsigned, it might well have been less effective. John Perry Barlow, Joichi Ito, and other U.S. bloggers express a very strong support for anonymous editing as one of the basic requirements of open politics as conducted on the Internet.

==Anonymity and pseudonymity in art==
Anonymity is directly related to the concept of obscurantism or pseudonymity, where an artist or a group attempts to remain anonymous, for various reasons such as adding an element of mystique to themselves or their work, attempting to avoid what is known as the &quot;cult of personality&quot; or hero worship (in which the charisma, good looks, wealth or other unrelated or mildly related aspects of the people is the main reason for interest in their work, rather than the work itself) or to break into a field or area of interest normally dominated by males (as by the famous science fiction author James Tiptree, Jr who was actually a woman named Alice Bradley Sheldon, and likely JT LeRoy). Some seem to want to avoid the &quot;limelight&quot; of popularity and to live private lives, such as Thomas Pynchon, J. D. Salinger, De Onbekende Beeldhouwer (an anonymous sculptor whose exhibited work in Amsterdam attracted strong attention in the 1980s and 1990s), and by DJ duo Daft Punk (1993-2021). For street artist Banksy, &quot;anonymity is vital to him because graffiti is illegal&quot;.

Anonymity has been used in music by avant-garde ensemble The Residents, Jandek (until 2004), costumed comedy rock band The Radioactive Chicken Heads, and DJs Deadmau5 (1998–present) and Marshmello (2015–present).

This is frequently applied in fiction, from The Lone Ranger, Superman, and Batman, where a hidden identity is assumed.

==Mathematics of anonymity==
Suppose that only Alice, Bob, and Carol have keys to a bank safe and that, one day, contents of the safe go missing (lock not violated). Without additional information, we cannot know for sure whether it was Alice, Bob or Carol who emptied the safe. Notably, each element in {Alice, Bob, Carol} could be the perpetrator with a probability of 1. However, as long as none of them was convicted with 100% certainty, we must hold that the perpetrator remains anonymous and that the attribution of the probability of 1 to one of the players has to remain undecided.

If Carol has a definite alibi at the time of perpetration, then we may deduce that it must have been either Alice or Bob who emptied the safe. In this particular case, the perpetrator is not completely anonymous anymore, as both Alice and Bob now know &quot;who did it&quot; with a probability of 1.

<text>A negative-feedback amplifier (or feedback amplifier) is an electronic amplifier that subtracts a fraction of its output from its input, so that negative feedback opposes the original signal. The applied negative feedback can improve its performance (gain stability, linearity, frequency response, step response) and reduces sensitivity to parameter variations due to manufacturing or environment. Because of these advantages, many amplifiers and control systems use negative feedback.

An idealized negative-feedback amplifier as shown in the diagram is a system of three elements (see Figure 1): 
* an &quot;amplifier&quot; with gain &quot;A&quot;OL,
* a &quot;feedback network&quot; &quot;β&quot;, which senses the output signal and possibly transforms it in some way (for example by attenuating or filtering it),
* a summing circuit that acts as a &quot;subtractor&quot; (the circle in the figure), which combines the input and the transformed output.

== Overview ==
Fundamentally, all electronic devices that provide power gain (e.g., vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors, MOS transistors) are nonlinear. Negative feedback trades gain for higher linearity (reducing distortion) and can provide other benefits. If not designed correctly, amplifiers with negative feedback can under some circumstances become unstable due to the feedback becoming positive, resulting in unwanted behavior such as oscillation. The Nyquist stability criterion developed by Harry Nyquist of Bell Laboratories is used to study the stability of feedback amplifiers.

Feedback amplifiers share these properties:

Pros:
* Can increase or decrease input impedance (depending on type of feedback).
* Can increase or decrease output impedance (depending on type of feedback).
* Reduces total distortion if sufficiently applied (increases linearity).
* Increases the bandwidth.
* Desensitizes gain to component variations.
* Can control step response of amplifier.

Cons:
* May lead to instability if not designed carefully.
* Amplifier gain decreases.
* Input and output impedances of a negative-feedback amplifier (&quot;closed-loop amplifier&quot;) become sensitive to the gain of an amplifier without feedback (&quot;open-loop amplifier&quot;)—that exposes these impedances to variations in the open-loop gain, for example, due to parameter variations or nonlinearity of the open-loop gain.
*Changes the composition of the distortion (increasing audibility) if insufficiently applied.

==History==
Paul Voigt patented a negative feedback amplifier in January 1924, though his theory lacked detail. Harold Stephen Black independently invented the negative-feedback amplifier while he was a passenger on the Lackawanna Ferry (from Hoboken Terminal to Manhattan) on his way to work at Bell Laboratories (located in Manhattan instead of New Jersey in 1927) on August 2, 1927 (US Patent 2,102,671, issued in 1937). Black was working on reducing distortion in repeater amplifiers used for telephone transmission. On a blank space in his copy of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he recorded the diagram found in Figure 1 and the equations derived below.
On August 8, 1928, Black submitted his invention to the U. S. Patent Office, which took more than 9 years to issue the patent. Black later wrote: &quot;One reason for the delay was that the concept was so contrary to established beliefs that the Patent Office initially did not believe it would work.&quot;

==Classical feedback==
Using the model of two unilateral blocks, several consequences of feedback are simply derived.

=== Gain reduction ===
Below, the voltage gain of the amplifier with feedback, the closed-loop gain &quot;A&quot;FB, is derived in terms of the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the open-loop gain &quot;A&quot;OL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The open-loop gain &quot;A&quot;OL in general may be a function of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent closed-loop gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators. The gain of the amplifier with feedback is derived below in the case of a voltage amplifier with voltage feedback.

Without feedback, the input voltage &quot;V′&quot;in is applied directly to the amplifier input. The according output voltage is

:formula_1

Suppose now that an attenuating feedback loop applies a fraction formula_2 of the output to one of the subtractor inputs so that it subtracts from the circuit input voltage &quot;V&quot;in applied to the other subtractor input. The result of subtraction applied to the amplifier input is

:formula_3

Substituting for &quot;V′&quot;in in the first expression,

:formula_4

Rearranging:

:formula_5

Then the gain of the amplifier with feedback, called the closed-loop gain, &quot;A&quot;FB is given by

:formula_6

If &quot;A&quot;OL ≫ 1, then &quot;A&quot;FB ≈ 1 / β, and the effective amplification (or closed-loop gain) &quot;A&quot;FB is set by the feedback constant β, and hence set by the feedback network, usually a simple reproducible network, thus making linearizing and stabilizing the amplification characteristics straightforward. If there are conditions where β &quot;A&quot;OL = −1, the amplifier has infinite amplification – it has become an oscillator, and the system is unstable. The stability characteristics of the gain feedback product β &quot;A&quot;OL are often displayed and investigated on a Nyquist plot (a polar plot of the gain/phase shift as a parametric function of frequency). A simpler, but less general technique, uses Bode plots.

The combination &quot;L&quot; = −β &quot;A&quot;OL appears commonly in feedback analysis and is called the loop gain. The combination (1 + β &quot;A&quot;OL) also appears commonly and is variously named as the desensitivity factor, return difference, or improvement factor.

=== Summary of terms ===

*Open-loop gain = formula_7
* Closed-loop gain = formula_8
* Feedback factor = formula_9
* Noise gain = formula_10
*Loop gain = formula_11
* Desensitivity factor = formula_12

===Bandwidth extension===

Feedback can be used to extend the bandwidth of an amplifier at the cost of lowering the amplifier gain. Figure 2 shows such a comparison. The figure is understood as follows. Without feedback the so-called open-loop gain in this example has a single-time-constant frequency response given by

:formula_13

where &quot;f&quot;C is the cutoff or corner frequency of the amplifier: in this example &quot;f&quot;C = 104 Hz, and the gain at zero frequency &quot;A&quot;0 = 105 V/V. The figure shows that the gain is flat out to the corner frequency and then drops. When feedback is present, the so-called closed-loop gain, as shown in the formula of the previous section, becomes

:formula_14

The last expression shows that the feedback amplifier still has a single-time-constant behavior, but the corner frequency is now increased by the improvement factor (1 + β &quot;A&quot;0), and the gain at zero frequency has dropped by exactly the same factor. This behavior is called the gain–bandwidth tradeoff. In Figure 2, (1 + β &quot;A&quot;0) = 103, so &quot;A&quot;FB(0) = 105 / 103 = 100 V/V, and &quot;f&quot;C increases to 104 × 103 = 107 Hz.

===Multiple poles===
When the close-loop gain has several poles, rather than the single pole of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case of more than two poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. See the discussion of gain margin and phase margin. For a complete discussion, see Sansen.

==Signal-flow analysis==

A principal idealization behind the formulation of the &quot;Introduction&quot; is the network&#x27;s division into two &quot;autonomous&quot; blocks (that is, with their own individually determined transfer functions), a simple example of what often is called &quot;circuit partitioning&quot;, which refers in this instance to the division into a forward amplification block and a feedback block. In practical amplifiers, the information flow is not unidirectional as shown here. Frequently these blocks are taken to be two-port networks to allow inclusion of bilateral information transfer. Casting an amplifier into this form is a non-trivial task, however, especially when the feedback involved is not &quot;global&quot; (that is directly from the output to the input) but &quot;local&quot; (that is, feedback within the network, involving nodes that do not coincide with input and/or output terminals). 

In these more general cases, the amplifier is analyzed more directly without the partitioning into blocks like those in the diagram, using instead some analysis based upon signal-flow analysis, such as the return-ratio method or the asymptotic gain model. Commenting upon the signal-flow approach, Choma says:
:&quot;In contrast to block diagram and two-port approaches to the feedback network analysis problem, signal flow methods mandate no &quot;a priori&quot; assumptions as to the unilateral or bilateral properties of the open loop and feedback subcircuits. Moreover, they are not predicated on mutually independent open loop and feedback subcircuit transfer functions, and they do not require that feedback be implemented only globally. Indeed signal flow techniques do not even require explicit identification of the open loop and feedback subcircuits. Signal flow thus removes the detriments pervasive of conventional feedback network analyses but additionally, it proves to be computationally efficient as well.&quot;

Following up on this suggestion, a signal-flow graph for a negative-feedback amplifier is shown in the figure, which is patterned after one by D&#x27;Amico &quot;et al.&quot;. Following these authors, the notation is as follows: 
:&quot;Variables &quot;x&quot;S, &quot;x&quot;O represent the input and output signals, moreover, two other generic variables, &quot;xi, xj&quot; linked together through the control (or critical) parameter &quot;P&quot; are explicitly shown. Parameters &quot;aij&quot; are the weight branches. Variables &quot;xi&quot;, &quot;xj&quot; and the control parameter, &quot;P&quot;, model a controlled generator, or the relation between voltage and current across two nodes of the circuit.

:The term &quot;a&quot;11 is the transfer function between the input and the output [after] setting the control parameter, &quot;P&quot;, to zero; term &quot;a&quot;12 is the transfer function between the output and the controlled variable &quot;xj&quot; [after] setting the input source, &quot;x&quot;S, to zero; term &quot;a&quot;21 represents the transfer function between the source variable and the inner variable, &quot;xi&quot; when the controlled variable &quot;xj&quot; is set to zero (i.e., when the control parameter, &quot;P&quot; is set to zero); term &quot;a&quot;22 gives the relation between the independent and the controlled inner variables setting control parameter, &quot;P&quot; and input variable, &quot;x&quot;S, to zero.&quot;

Using this graph, these authors derive the generalized gain expression in terms of the control parameter &quot;P&quot; that defines the controlled source relationship &quot;xj&quot; = &quot;Pxi&quot;:
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17

Combining these results, the gain is given by
:formula_18

To employ this formula, one has to identify a critical controlled source for the particular amplifier circuit in hand. For example, &quot;P&quot; could be the control parameter of one of the controlled sources in a two-port network, as shown for a particular case in D&#x27;Amico &quot;et al.&quot; As a different example, if we take &quot;a&quot;12 = &quot;a&quot;21 = 1, &quot;P&quot; = &quot;A&quot;, &quot;a&quot;22 = –β (negative feedback) and &quot;a&quot;11 = 0 (no feedforward), we regain the simple result with two unidirectional blocks.

==Two-port analysis of feedback==

Although, as mentioned in the section &quot;Signal-flow analysis&quot;, some form of signal-flow analysis is the most general way to treat the negative-feedback amplifier, representation as two two-ports is the approach most often presented in textbooks and is presented here. It retains a two-block circuit partition of the amplifier, but allows the blocks to be bilateral. Some drawbacks of this method are described at the end.

Electronic amplifiers use current or voltage as input and output, so four types of amplifier are possible (any of two possible inputs with any of two possible outputs). See classification of amplifiers. The objective for the feedback amplifier may be any one of the four types of amplifier and is not necessarily the same type as the open-loop amplifier, which itself may be any one of these types. So, for example, an op amp (voltage amplifier) can be arranged to make a current amplifier instead.

Negative-feedback amplifiers of any type can be implemented using combinations of two-port networks. There are four types of two-port network, and the type of amplifier desired dictates the choice of two-ports and the selection of one of the four different connection topologies shown in the diagram. These connections are usually referred to as series or shunt (parallel) connections. In the diagram, the left column shows shunt inputs; the right column shows series inputs. The top row shows series outputs; the bottom row shows shunt outputs. The various combinations of connections and two-ports are listed in the table below.
For example, for a current-feedback amplifier, current from the output is sampled for feedback and combined with current at the input. Therefore, the feedback ideally is performed using an (output) current-controlled current source (CCCS), and its imperfect realization using a two-port network also must incorporate a CCCS, that is, the appropriate choice for feedback network is a g-parameter two-port. Here the two-port method used in most textbooks is presented, using the circuit treated in the article on asymptotic gain model.

Figure 3 shows a two-transistor amplifier with a feedback resistor &quot;R&quot;f. The aim is to analyze this circuit to find three items: the gain, the output impedance looking into the amplifier from the load, and the input impedance looking into the amplifier from the source.

===Replacement of the feedback network with a two-port===
The first step is replacement of the feedback network by a two-port. Just what components go into the two-port?

On the input side of the two-port we have &quot;R&quot;f. If the voltage at the right side of &quot;R&quot;f changes, it changes the current in &quot;R&quot;f that is subtracted from the current entering the base of the input transistor. That is, the input side of the two-port is a dependent current source controlled by the voltage at the top of resistor &quot;R&quot;2.

One might say the second stage of the amplifier is just a voltage follower, transmitting the voltage at the collector of the input transistor to the top of &quot;R&quot;2. That is, the monitored output signal is really the voltage at the collector of the input transistor. That view is legitimate, but then the voltage follower stage becomes part of the feedback network. That makes analysis of feedback more complicated.

An alternative view is that the voltage at the top of &quot;R&quot;2 is set by the emitter current of the output transistor. That view leads to an entirely passive feedback network made up of &quot;R&quot;2 and &quot;R&quot;f. The variable controlling the feedback is the emitter current, so the feedback is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). We search through the four available two-port networks and find the only one with a CCCS is the g-parameter two-port, shown in Figure 4. The next task is to select the g-parameters so that the two-port of Figure 4 is electrically equivalent to the L-section made up of &quot;R&quot;2 and &quot;R&quot;f. That selection is an algebraic procedure made most simply by looking at two individual cases: the case with &quot;V&quot;1 = 0, which makes the VCVS on the right side of the two-port a short-circuit; and the case with &quot;I&quot;2 = 0. which makes the CCCS on the left side an open circuit. The algebra in these two cases is simple, much easier than solving for all variables at once. The choice of g-parameters that make the two-port and the L-section behave the same way are shown in the table below.

===Small-signal circuit===
The next step is to draw the small-signal schematic for the amplifier with the two-port in place using the hybrid-pi model for the transistors. Figure 5 shows the schematic with notation &quot;R&quot;3 = &quot;R&quot;C2 || &quot;R&quot;L and &quot;R&quot;11 = 1 / &quot;g&quot;11, &quot;R&quot;22 = &quot;g&quot;22.

===Loaded open-loop gain===
Figure 3 indicates the output node, but not the choice of output variable. A useful choice is the short-circuit current output of the amplifier (leading to the short-circuit current gain). Because this variable leads simply to any of the other choices (for example, load voltage or load current), the short-circuit current gain is found below.

First the loaded open-loop gain is found. The feedback is turned off by setting &quot;g&quot;12 = &quot;g&quot;21 = 0. The idea is to find how much the amplifier gain is changed because of the resistors in the feedback network by themselves, with the feedback turned off. This calculation is pretty easy because &quot;R&quot;11, &quot;R&quot;B, and &quot;r&quot;π1 all are in parallel and &quot;v&quot;1 = &quot;v&quot;π. Let &quot;R&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot;11 || &quot;R&quot;B || &quot;r&quot;π1. In addition, &quot;i&quot;2 = −(β+1) &quot;i&quot;B. The result for the open-loop current gain &quot;A&quot;OL is:

::formula_19

===Gain with feedback===
In the classical approach to feedback, the feedforward represented by the VCVS (that is, &quot;g&quot;21 &quot;v&quot;1) is neglected. That makes the circuit of Figure 5 resemble the block diagram of Figure 1, and the gain with feedback is then:

::formula_20
:::formula_21

where the feedback factor βFB = −g12. Notation βFB is introduced for the feedback factor to distinguish it from the transistor β.

===Input and output resistances===

Feedback is used to better match signal sources to their loads. For example, a direct connection of a voltage source to a resistive load may result in signal loss due to voltage division, but interjecting a negative feedback amplifier can increase the apparent load seen by the source, and reduce the apparent driver impedance seen by the load, avoiding signal attenuation by voltage division. This advantage is not restricted to voltage amplifiers, but analogous improvements in matching can be arranged for current amplifiers, transconductance amplifiers and transresistance amplifiers.

To explain these effects of feedback upon impedances, first a digression on how two-port theory approaches resistance determination, and then its application to the amplifier at hand.

====Background on resistance determination====
Figure 6 shows an equivalent circuit for finding the input resistance of a feedback voltage amplifier (left) and for a feedback current amplifier (right). These arrangements are typical Miller theorem applications.

In the case of the voltage amplifier, the output voltage β&quot;V&quot;out of the feedback network is applied in series and with an opposite polarity to the input voltage &quot;Vx&quot; travelling over the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are the same). As a result, the effective voltage across and the current through the amplifier input resistance &quot;R&quot;in decrease so that the circuit input resistance increases (one might say that &quot;R&quot;in apparently increases). Its new value can be calculated by applying Miller theorem (for voltages) or the basic circuit laws. Thus Kirchhoff&#x27;s voltage law provides:

::formula_22

where &quot;v&quot;out = &quot;A&quot;v &quot;v&quot;in = &quot;A&quot;v &quot;I&quot;x &quot;R&quot;in. Substituting this result in the above equation and solving for the input resistance of the feedback amplifier, the result is:

::formula_23

The general conclusion from this example and a similar example for the output resistance case is:
&quot;A series feedback connection at the input (output) increases the input (output) resistance by a factor ( 1 + β &quot;A&quot;OL )&quot;, where &quot;A&quot;OL = open loop gain.

On the other hand, for the current amplifier, the output current β&quot;I&quot;out of the feedback network is applied in parallel and with an opposite direction to the input current &quot;Ix&quot;. As a result, the total current flowing through the circuit input (not only through the input resistance &quot;R&quot;in) increases and the voltage across it decreases so that the circuit input resistance decreases (&quot;R&quot;in apparently decreases). Its new value can be calculated by applying the dual Miller theorem (for currents) or the basic Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws:

::formula_24

where &quot;i&quot;out = &quot;A&quot;i &quot;i&quot;in = &quot;A&quot;i &quot;V&quot;x / &quot;R&quot;in. Substituting this result in the above equation and solving for the input resistance of the feedback amplifier, the result is:

::formula_25

The general conclusion from this example and a similar example for the output resistance case is:
&quot;A parallel feedback connection at the input (output) decreases the input (output) resistance by a factor ( 1 + β &quot;A&quot;OL )&quot;, where &quot;A&quot;OL = open loop gain.

These conclusions can be generalized to treat cases with arbitrary Norton or Thévenin drives, arbitrary loads, and general two-port feedback networks. However, the results do depend upon the main amplifier having a representation as a two-port – that is, the results depend on the &quot;same&quot; current entering and leaving the input terminals, and likewise, the same current that leaves one output terminal must enter the other output terminal.

A broader conclusion, independent of the quantitative details, is that feedback can be used to increase or to decrease the input and output impedance.

====Application to the example amplifier====
These resistance results now are applied to the amplifier of Figure 3 and Figure 5. The &quot;improvement factor&quot; that reduces the gain, namely ( 1 + βFB AOL), directly decides the effect of feedback upon the input and output resistances of the amplifier. In the case of a shunt connection, the input impedance is reduced by this factor; and in the case of series connection, the impedance is multiplied by this factor. However, the impedance that is modified by feedback is the impedance of the amplifier in Figure 5 with the feedback turned off, and does include the modifications to impedance caused by the resistors of the feedback network.

Therefore, the input impedance seen by the source with feedback turned off is &quot;R&quot;in = &quot;R&quot;1 = &quot;R&quot;11 || &quot;R&quot;B || &quot;r&quot;π1, and with the feedback turned on (but no feedforward)

::formula_26

where &quot;division&quot; is used because the input connection is &quot;shunt&quot;: the feedback two-port is in parallel with the signal source at the input side of the amplifier. A reminder: &quot;A&quot;OL is the &quot;loaded&quot; open loop gain found above, as modified by the resistors of the feedback network.

The impedance seen by the load needs further discussion. The load in Figure 5 is connected to the collector of the output transistor, and therefore is separated from the body of the amplifier by the infinite impedance of the output current source. Therefore, feedback has no effect on the output impedance, which remains simply &quot;R&quot;C2 as seen by the load resistor &quot;R&quot;L in Figure 3.

If instead we wanted to find the impedance presented at the &quot;emitter&quot; of the output transistor (instead of its collector), which is series connected to the feedback network, feedback would increase this resistance by the improvement factor ( 1 + βFB AOL).

===Load voltage and load current===
The gain derived above is the current gain at the collector of the output transistor. To relate this gain to the gain when voltage is the output of the amplifier, notice that the output voltage at the load &quot;R&quot;L is related to the collector current by Ohm&#x27;s law as &quot;v&quot;L = &quot;i&quot;C (&quot;R&quot;C2 || &quot;R&quot;L). Consequently, the transresistance gain &quot;v&quot;L / &quot;i&quot;S is found by multiplying the current gain by &quot;R&quot;C2 || &quot;R&quot;L:

::formula_27

Similarly, if the output of the amplifier is taken to be the current in the load resistor &quot;R&quot;L, current division determines the load current, and the gain is then:

::formula_28

=== Is the main amplifier block a two-port? ===

Some drawbacks of the two two-port approach follow, intended for the attentive reader.

Figure 7 shows the small-signal schematic with the main amplifier and the feedback two-port in shaded boxes. The feedback two-port satisfies the port conditions: at the input port, &quot;I&quot;in enters and leaves the port, and likewise at the output, &quot;I&quot;out enters and leaves.

Is the main amplifier block also a two-port? The main amplifier is shown in the upper shaded box. The ground connections are labeled. Figure 7 shows the interesting fact that the main amplifier does not satisfy the port conditions at its input and output &quot;unless&quot; the ground connections are chosen to make that happen. For example, on the input side, the current entering the main amplifier is &quot;I&quot;S. This current is divided three ways: to the feedback network, to the bias resistor &quot;R&quot;B and to the base resistance of the input transistor &quot;r&quot;π. To satisfy the port condition for the main amplifier, all three components must be returned to the input side of the main amplifier, which means all the ground leads labeled &quot;G&quot;1 must be connected, as well as emitter lead &quot;G&quot;E1. Likewise, on the output side, all ground connections &quot;G&quot;2 must be connected and also ground connection &quot;G&quot;E2. Then, at the bottom of the schematic, underneath the feedback two-port and outside the amplifier blocks, &quot;G&quot;1 is connected to &quot;G&quot;2. That forces the ground currents to divide between the input and output sides as planned. Notice that this connection arrangement &quot;splits the emitter&quot; of the input transistor into a base-side and a collector-side – a physically impossible thing to do, but electrically the circuit sees all the ground connections as one node, so this fiction is permitted.

Of course, the way the ground leads are connected makes no difference to the amplifier (they are all one node), but it makes a difference to the port conditions. This artificiality is a weakness of this approach: the port conditions are needed to justify the method, but the circuit really is unaffected by how currents are traded among ground connections.

However, if no possible arrangement of ground conditions leads to the port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (it just is not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, just did not think of splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.

A more practical choice is to drop the two-port approach altogether, and use various alternatives based on signal flow graph theory, including the Rosenstark method, the Choma method, and use of Blackman&#x27;s theorem. That choice may be advisable if small-signal device models are complex, or are not available (for example, the devices are known only numerically, perhaps from measurement or from SPICE simulations).

== Feedback amplifier formulas ==
Summarizing the two-port analysis of feedback, one can get this table of formulas.

The variables and their meanings are

formula_29- gain, formula_30- current, formula_31- voltage,formula_9- feedback gain and formula_33- resistance.

The subscripts and their meanings are

formula_34- feedback amplifier, formula_35- voltage,formula_36- transconductance, formula_37- transresistance, formula_38- output and formula_39- current for gains and feedback and formula_39- input for resistances.

For example formula_41means voltage feedback amplifier gain.

== Distortion ==
Simple amplifiers like the common emitter configuration have primarily low-order distortion, such as the 2nd and 3rd harmonics. In audio systems, these can be minimally audible because musical signals are typically already a harmonic series, and the low-order distortion products are hidden by the masking effect of the human hearing system.

After applying moderate amounts of negative feedback (10–15 dB), the low-order harmonics are reduced, but higher-order harmonics are introduced. Since these are not masked as well, the distortion becomes audibly worse, even though the overall THD may go down. This has led to a persistent myth that negative feedback is detrimental in audio amplifiers, leading audiophile manufacturers to market their amplifiers as &quot;zero feedback&quot; (even when they use local feedback to linearize each stage).

However, as the amount of negative feedback is increased further, &quot;all&quot; harmonics are reduced, returning the distortion to inaudibility, and then improving it beyond the original zero-feedback stage (provided the system is strictly stable). So the problem is not negative feedback, but insufficient amounts of it.

<text>The Oxford Canal is a narrowboat canal in southern central England linking the City of Oxford with the Coventry Canal at Hawkesbury (just north of Coventry and south of Bedworth) via Banbury and Rugby. Completed in 1790, it connects to the River Thames at Oxford, and links with the Grand Union Canal, which it is combined with for between to the villages of Braunston and Napton-on-the-Hill.

The canal is usually divided into the North Oxford Canal (north of Napton, via Rugby to Hawkesbury Junction near Coventry) and the South Oxford Canal, south of Napton to Banbury and Oxford.

The canal was for about 15 years the main canal artery of trade between the Midlands and London, via its connection to the Thames, until the Grand Union Canal (then called the Grand Junction Canal) took most of the London-bound traffic following its opening in 1805. The North Oxford Canal (which had been straightened in the 1830s) remained an important artery of trade carrying coal and other commodities until the 1960s; the more rural South Oxford Canal however became something of a backwater, especially following the opening of the Grand Junction Canal, and it faced closure proposals in the 1950s. Since the end of regular commercial goods carriage on the canal in the 1960s, it has gained a new use as a leisure resource, and become used primarily for narrowboat pleasure boating.

The Oxford Canal traverses Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire and east Warwickshire through broad, shallow valleys and lightly rolling hills; the canal&#x27;s route northeast and then northwest forms part of the Warwickshire ring.

==The route==

The canal begins in Warwickshire near Hawkesbury Village at Hawkesbury Junction, also known as &quot;Sutton Stop&quot;, where it connects with the Coventry Canal, a little over 4 miles (or about 7 km) from the centre of Coventry and from Nuneaton. Within a mile were the late 18th- and 19th-century coal field/pit and colliery of the small town of Bedworth. From Hawkesbury, it runs southeast through the Warwickshire countryside for to Rugby.

The route between Coventry and Rugby is level, with no locks, apart from the stop lock at the junction. Parts of this section were straightened by raising and waterproofing in the 1820s; the remains of a more circuitous route (which kept to the chosen contour) can still be seen in places.

The canal winds through the northern part of Rugby. It passes through the Newbold Tunnel. In the churchyard in Newbold-on-Avon remains can be seen of an earlier canal tunnel built in the 1770s. It scales a flight of three locks at Hillmorton about east-southeast of the town.

East of Rugby, the canal passes southwest then south. It crosses under the M45 motorway and through broad low fields interspersed by views of wooded knolls and modest hills of Northamptonshire and Warwickshire to reach Braunston.

West of Braunston village centre, by a pub, the canal converges with the Grand Union Canal where both change direction to west-southwest. The latter canal has a major wharf, Braunston Marina, east and a campsite. The combined canal splits north of Napton-on-the-Hill:
*The Oxford Canal runs southwest and then turns south towards Oxford via Banbury.
*The Grand Union Canal runs north passing opposing marinas within a mile then northwest to Birmingham via Warwick.

After winding round Napton Hill, the canal ascends the Napton flight of nine locks to a local summit reach, well below the hilltop. After passing an old wharf and a pub at Fenny Compton, the canal enters a long cutting which until some time in the 19th century was a tunnel. This section is normally referred to as a &quot;tunnel straight&quot; or the Fenny Compton Tunnel.

The route between the farms of Priors Hardwick and Fenny Compton was never straightened, and is the most circuitous in the region: taking to cover (geodesically, as the crow flies). This coincides with the canal&#x27;s highest &quot;summit&quot; reach in navigational terms. This reach is the &quot;eleven-mile pound&quot; mentioned in Tom Rolt&#x27;s &quot;Narrow Boat&quot;.

The canal then descends the Claydon flight of locks and into the vale of the nascent Cherwell at Cropredy. The canal descends the valley to Oxford.

Banbury has many visitor moorings alongside the historic and modern shopping areas in the middle of town. Banbury Town Council and Cherwell District Council treat the canal as an attraction to be encouraged; examples of its work include an old boatyard which has been incorporated into the town centre: Tooley&#x27;s Historic Boatyard. About south is a lightly settled locality, Twyford Wharf, where narrowboats up to can be turned. Two villages nearby, Kings Sutton and Adderbury (Twyford), are within 30 minutes&#x27; walking distance along the road. Both offer several pubs.

Within Oxford&#x27;s conurbation, the end of the canal has two links to the Thames:
* north of the city where Dukes Cut leads to King&#x27;s Lock; 
*a few hundred yards (metres) from the heart of the city centre by Oxford railway station. below Isis Lock (known to boatmen as &#x27;Louse Lock&#x27;) through Sheepwash Channel. This leads to an elongated navigable circuit at the Thames called &quot;Four Rivers&quot; above Osney Lock.

After below Isis Lock the Oxford Canal ends abruptly at Hythe Bridge Street near to the current Hythe Bridge over the Castle Mill Stream, a backwater of the River Thames that runs parallel to the Oxford Canal for its southernmost part. The canal used to continue through a bridge under Hythe Bridge Street to a turning basin and goods wharf south of Hythe Bridge Street. It then continued via a bridge under Worcester Street to end in a coal wharf beside New Road. In 1951 the basin and wharves were filled in and Nuffield College has taken part of the site.

The locks on the canal are as follows.

The canal rises from Hawkesbury Junction to Hilmorton Top Lock, there is then a pound to Braunston Junction, where it joins the Grand Union canal. From Napton Junction the Oxford canal rises again though the Napton Locks. After Napton Top Lock there is a pound to Claydon Top Lock, from where the canal falls towards Oxford. 

==History==
===Construction===

The Oxford Canal was constructed in several stages over a period of more than twenty years.
In 1769 the (9 Geo. 3. c. 70) authorising the Oxford Canal was passed, having been promoted in Parliament by Sir Roger Newdigate MP, who chaired the canal company. The intention was to link the industrial English Midlands to London via the River Thames. Construction began shortly after near Coventry. The principal motivation for the canal was the transport of coal from the Midlands to Oxford and London.

Surveying of the route and initial construction were originally supervised by the celebrated engineer James Brindley, assisted by Samuel Simcock who was also Brindley&#x27;s brother-in-law. Brindley died in 1772, when the canal had only reached Brinklow, and Simcock took over. By 1774 the canal had reached Napton, but the company was already running out of money.


A second act, the (15 Geo. 3. c. 9) was passed allowing the company to raise more funds. Construction soon started again and by 1778 the canal had reached Banbury. Financial problems meant that work on the final stretch from Banbury to Oxford did not begin until 1786, and when it did, James Barnes was appointed as the engineer. As funds were limited, the Banbury-Oxford stretch was built more cheaply, and to lower standards than the rest of the canal, and many cost saving measures were used whenever possible: Wooden lift or swing bridges were built, instead of more expensive fixed brick bridges. Deep locks were used wherever possible, with single gates at both ends instead of double gates. A stretch of the River Cherwell at Shipton-on-Cherwell was incorporated into the canal. This reduced construction costs, but the behaviour of the river makes the canal more difficult to use.

The Oxford Canal reached the outskirts of Oxford in 1789, when a coal wharf was opened at Heyfield Hutt, now the site of Hayfield Road. The final section into central Oxford was ceremonially opened on 1 January 1790.

The Duke&#x27;s Cut, a short link from the Oxford Canal to the River Thames, just north of Oxford, was built in 1789 by the Duke of Marlborough.

The River Swift (a tributary of the River Avon) connected to the original route of the Oxford Canal near Cosford and was used as a water feeder to the canal. In 1785 there was a proposal to make the river navigable from the Oxford Canal at Cosford to the town of Lutterworth in Leicestershire. This proposal however never came to fruition. The River Swift, however is still an important feeder to the northern Oxford Canal, via the now unnavigable Brownsover Arm; a part of the canal which was bypassed when the canal was straightened.

===Commercial use===
====Heyday====
For the next 15 years the Oxford Canal became one of the most important and profitable transport links in Britain, with most commercial traffic between London and the Midlands using the route. Its principal traffic was coal from Warwickshire. It also carried stone, agricultural products and other goods.

A much more direct route between London and the Midlands, the Grand Junction Canal, was completed in 1805, connecting Braunston to London in much less distance. Much of the London-bound traffic switched to this faster route, as it avoided the passage of the River Thames which still had many flash locks. This greatly reduced Oxford Canal traffic south of Napton. However, the short section between Braunston and Napton became the link between the Warwick and Napton Canal and the Grand Junction Canal, making it part of the busy direct route between Birmingham and London. Despite these developments, the Oxford Canal remained highly profitable during this period; from 1824 to 1826, the company paid dividends of up to 55% to its shareholders.

The Grand Junction and Oxford canal companies were bitter rivals. When Parliament considered the Act of Parliament for the building of the Grand Junction, the Oxford Canal successfully petitioned to make the Grand Junction pay &quot;bar tolls&quot; to the Oxford Canal to compensate for the loss of traffic south of Napton.

Traffic from Birmingham had to use of the Oxford Canal to get from Braunston to join the Grand Junction at Napton. The Oxford Canal exploited this by charging high tolls for Grand Junction traffic on this short section.

====Straightening====
The Oxford Canal was originally built as a contour canal, meaning that it twisted around hills to minimise vertical deviations from a level contour. This meant however that the canal followed a very winding and circuitous route: Although the distance between Coventry and Napton was only as the crow flies, the distance by the original route of the canal was . This mattered little when the Oxford Canal had no competition, however, with increased canal competition, and one eye on the developing railway network, the company decided to straighten the route. 

In 1827 Marc Isambard Brunel (father of Isambard Kingdom Brunel) re-surveyed the northern section of the canal between Braunston and Hawkesbury Junction to straighten it out and reduce navigation time. The following year another survey was carried out by Charles Vignoles. The work to straighten the canal was carried out between 1831 and 1834, the majority of the work being in the Rugby area, and this reduced the distance by . The original tunnel at Newbold-on-Avon was abandoned when the canal was straightened, and replaced by a new one on a different alignment. The south portal of the old tunnel can still be seen next to the churchyard. The old line of the canal was either abandoned, or remained in use as arms serving various village wharves. The section south of Napton was never straightened.

====Slow decline====
The straightening of the canal coincided with the beginning of the railway age, and the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838, signalled the end of the dominance of the canals. However, despite the railway competition, the total tonnages of cargo carried on the canal did not decline immediately, and in fact continued to rise for some time, however, the company was forced to slash its tolls in order to remain competitive, and this put an end to the large profits which had previously been made, although ironically the railways provided a new source of income to the canal, who paid them to provide water for their locomotives at Rugby. Traffic on the canal remained such that the three locks at Hillmorton, the first on the canal after the stop lock at Hawkesbury Junction, became severely congested. The solution to the congestion was to duplicate or twin the existing locks at Hillmorton, creating three pairs of two parallel narrow locks, which allowed twice the traffic to pass the lock at any time. The work to double the locks was completed in August 1840. In 1842, nearly 21,000 boats passed through the locks.

In 1833 a section of the new line of canal in Barby Fields near Dunchurch was used as a test site for a new wrought iron boat, &quot;Swallow&quot;, built by Graham and Houston. Drawn by two horses, the boat completed a distance of 1.5 mile in 7 minutes 35 seconds, a speed of almost 12 miles per hour.

Traffic on the Oxford Canal held up reasonably well in the face of railway competition compared to many other navigations, but did see a gradual decline; in 1838, 520,000 tons were carried, which declined to 482,000 tons in 1868. However, income declined much more sharply due to the company slashing its tolls; takings which had gone from £18,478 in 1791/3, and then risen to a maximum of £90,446 in 1827/29, then fell to £26,312 in 1855. Nevertheless, the company was still profitable, and was able to pay dividends. 

The northern section of the Oxford Canal between Coventry, Braunston and Napton remained an important trunk route, and remained extremely busy with freight traffic until the 1960s. The staple traffic was coal from the Warwickshire and Leicestershire coalfields to London via the Grand Union Canal. However, the southern section from Napton to Oxford became something of a backwater, and carried mostly local traffic.

====20th century====
In 1934, the Braunston-Napton stretch of the canal was taken over by the recently formed Grand Union Canal company, and widened as part of that company&#x27;s London to Birmingham main-line.

In a bid to raise funds to overcome an arrears of maintenance, in 1936, the Oxford Canal Company decided to sell off their terminal basin at Oxford. In 1937 Baron Nuffield (Later Viscount Nuffield) bought the canal basin at Oxford for £133,373 (). In 1951 he filled it in and built Nuffield College on part of the former coal wharf. Coal traffic was relocated to a canal wharf in Juxon Street, in Jericho, Oxford. The goods wharf and the remainder of the coal wharf are now under a public car park that Nuffield College lets to Oxford City Council. For this reason, the canal today ends abruptly in central Oxford.

Many Oxford Canal boatmen and women favoured horse traction long after those on other canals had changed their narrowboats to diesel power. In the 1930s, only around one in thirty of the boats trading on the canal&#x27;s southern section was mechanically powered. One narrowboat carrying coal on the Oxford Canal was drawn by a mule until 1959 and was the last horse-drawn freight narrowboat in Great Britain. This boat, &quot;Friendship&quot;, is preserved at the National Waterways Museum, Ellesmere Port.

The Oxford Canal remained independent until it was nationalised in 1948 and became part of the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, later the British Waterways Board. The Oxford Canal remained profitable until the mid-1950s, paying a dividend right up until nationalisation. As with most of Britain&#x27;s narrow canal system, the Oxford Canal suffered from a rapid decline in freight traffic after the Second World War. By the mid-1950s very few narrowboats traded south of Napton and the southern section was at one point being threatened with closure, although the northern section (Napton to Coventry) remained well-used by commercial traffic until the 1960s.

===Revival===

During the 1960s pleasure boating began to grow in popularity and replace the old trading boats, After a fact-finding cruise on the canal, Barbara Castle (Minister for Transport) rejected a proposal for closure. The canal was designated as a cruiseway under the Transport Act 1968, which defined at as being a waterway to be maintained for leisure use.

The canal is now thriving. In the summer it is one of the most crowded canals on the network.

==Oxford Canal Walk==

The towpath of the canal, with a extension from Hawkesbury Junction to Coventry on the towpath of the Coventry Canal, forms the Oxford Canal Walk. The stretch from Oxford to Kirtlington, where the Oxfordshire Way meets the canal, is also part of European walking route E2. The Canal Walk is popular with geocachers with many Geocache sites located alongside the canal.

<text>Forward-looking infrared (FLIR) cameras, typically used on military and civilian aircraft, use a thermographic camera that senses infrared radiation.

The sensors installed in forward-looking infrared cameras, as well as those of other thermal imaging cameras, use detection of infrared radiation, typically emitted from a heat source (thermal radiation), to create an image assembled for video output.

They can be used to help pilots and drivers steer their vehicles at night and in fog, or to detect warm objects against a cooler background. The wavelength of infrared that thermal imaging cameras detect is 3 to 12 μm and differs significantly from that of night vision, which operates in the visible light and near-infrared ranges (0.4 to 1.0  μm).

== Design ==
Infrared light falls into two basic ranges: &quot;long-wave&quot; and &quot;medium-wave&quot;. Long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras, sometimes called &quot;far-infrared&quot;, operate at 8 to 12 μm and can see heat sources, such as hot engine parts or human body heat, several kilometers away. Longer-distance viewing is made more difficult with LWIR because the infrared light is absorbed, scattered, and refracted by air and by water vapor.

Some long-wave cameras require their detector to be cryogenically cooled, typically for several minutes before use, although some moderately sensitive infrared cameras do not require this. Many thermal imagers, including some forward-looking infrared cameras (such as some LWIR enhanced vision systems (EVS)) are also uncooled.

&quot;Medium-wave&quot; (MWIR) cameras operate in the 3–5 μm range. These can see almost as well, since those frequencies are less affected by water-vapor absorption, but generally require a more expensive sensor array, along with cryogenic cooling.

Many camera systems use digital image processing to improve the image quality. Infrared imaging sensor arrays often have wildly inconsistent sensitivities from pixel to pixel, due to limitations in the manufacturing process. To remedy this, the response of each pixel is measured at the factory, and a transform, most often linear, maps the measured input signal to an output level.

Some companies offer advanced &quot;fusion&quot; technologies that blend a visible-spectrum image with an infrared-spectrum image to produce better results than a single-spectrum image alone.

==Properties==
Thermal imaging cameras such as the Raytheon AN/AAQ-26 are used in a variety of applications, including naval vessels, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, armored fighting vehicles, and military-grade smartphones.

In warfare, they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies:
# The imager itself is nearly impossible to detect for the enemy, as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target, as with radar or sonar.
# It sees radiation in the infrared spectrum, which is difficult to camouflage.
# These camera systems can see through smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants better than a visible light camera can.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;forward-looking&quot; is used to distinguish fixed forward-looking thermal imaging systems from sideways-tracking infrared systems, also known as &quot;push broom&quot; imagers, and other thermal imaging systems such as gimbal-mounted imaging systems, handheld imaging systems, and the like. Pushbroom systems typically have been used on aircraft and satellites.

Sideways-tracking imagers normally involve a one-dimensional (1D) array of pixels, which uses the motion of the aircraft or satellite to move the view of the 1D array across the ground to build up a 2D image over time. Such systems cannot be used for real-time imaging and must look perpendicular to the direction of travel.

==History==
In 1956, Texas Instruments began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and, with the addition of a second scan mirror, the invention of the first forward-looking infrared camera occurred in 1963, with production beginning in 1966. In 1972, TI introduced the Common Module concept, which greatly reduced costs and allowed for the reuse of common components.

== Uses==
*Traffic video detection and monitoring 
*Surveillance and/or capture of mammals
**Detection of illegal immigrants hidden in lorries/trucks
**Warning drivers about sudden road obstructions caused by deer
**Location through smoke and/or haze
*Search and rescue operations for missing persons especially in wooded areas or water
*Target acquisition and tracking by military or civil aircraft
*Drainage basin temperature monitoring and monitoring wild game habitats
*Detection of energy loss or consumption, or insulation defects
**Mapping insulation levels (pipes, walls, joints etc.) in order to reduce HVAC energy consumption
**Quality control for especially electrical installations (a picture can reveal if loads are higher than expected, or show bad and potentially failing joints)
**Search for drug labs and/or indoor cannabis producers (especially at night)
*Piloting of aircraft in low visibility (IMC) conditions
*Pinpoint sources of ignition during firefighting operations
*Monitoring active volcanoes
*Detecting faulty or overheating electrical joints, connections, and components
*Night driving
*Identification or visual acquirement of hostile ground vehicles or personnel

== Cost ==

The cost of thermal imaging equipment in general has fallen dramatically after inexpensive portable and fixed infrared detectors and systems based on microelectromechanical technology were designed and manufactured for commercial, industrial, and military application. Also, older camera designs used rotating mirrors to scan the image to a small sensor. More modern cameras no longer use this method; the simplification helps reduce cost. Uncooled technology available in many Enhanced Flight Vision System (EFVS or EVS) products have reduced the costs to fractions of the price of older cooled technology, with similar performance.

EVS is rapidly becoming mainstream on many fixed wing and rotary wing operators from Cirrus and Cessna aircraft to large business jets.

== Police actions ==
In 2001, the United States Supreme Court decided in &quot;Kyllo v. United States&quot; that performing surveillance of private property (ostensibly to detect high emission grow lights used in clandestine cannabis farming) using thermal imaging cameras without a search warrant by law enforcement violates the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.

In the 2004 &quot;R. v. Tessling&quot; judgment, the Supreme Court of Canada determined that the use of airborne FLIR in surveillance by police was permitted without requiring a search warrant. The Court determined that the general nature of the data gathered by FLIR did not reveal personal information of the occupants and therefore was not in violation of Tessling&#x27;s Section 8 rights afforded under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982). Ian Binnie distinguished the Canadian law with respect to the Kyllo judgment, by agreeing with the Kyllo minority that public officials should not have to avert their senses or their equipment from detecting emissions in the public domain such as excessive heat, traces of smoke, suspicious odors, odorless gases, airborne particulates, or radioactive emissions, any of which could identify hazards to the community.

In June 2014, the Canadian National Aerial Surveillance Program DHC-8M-100 aircraft mounted with infrared sensors was instrumental in the search for Justin Bourque, a fugitive who had killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police members in Moncton. The plane&#x27;s crew used its advanced heat-sensing camera to discover Bourque&#x27;s heat signature in the deep brushwoods at midnight.

During 2015 Baltimore protests, the FBI conducted 10 aerial surveillance missions between April 29 and May 3, which included &quot;infrared and day color, full-motion FLIR video evidence&quot; collection, according to FBI spokesman Christopher Allen. A FLIR Talon multi-sensor camera system equipped with an infrared laser pointer (which is invisible to casual observers) for illumination purposes was used to gather data at night. The American Civil Liberties Union raised concerns over the fact that new surveillance technology is implemented without judicial guidance and public discussion. According to Nathan Wessler, an ACLU attorney, &quot;this is a dynamic we see again and again when it comes to advances in surveillance. By the time details leak out, programs are firmly entrenched, and it&#x27;s all but impossible to roll them back – and very hard to put in place restrictions and oversight.&quot;

<doc id="181392" wikidata="Q676576" url="?curid=181392" title="Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport">
<text>Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is a public airport in Arlington County, Virginia, United States, from Washington, D.C. The closest airport to the nation&#x27;s capital, it is owned by the federal government and is one of two 
operated by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) that serve the Washington metropolitan area; the other is Dulles International Airport, located about to the west in Fairfax and Loudoun counties.

The airport opened in 1941 and was originally named Washington National Airport. Part of the original terminal is still in use as Terminal 1. A larger second terminal, now known as Terminal 2, opened in 1997. In 1998, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed a bill renaming the airport in honor of the 40th president of the United States, Ronald Reagan, who was in office from 1981 to 1989.

Reagan National serves 98 nonstop destinations . It is a hub for American Airlines. It hosts international flights, but the airport has no immigration and customs facilities, restricting routes to those with U.S. Customs and Border Protection preclearance facilities, including major airports in Canada and the Caribbean. Reagan National is also home to Coast Guard Air Station Washington.

The 24th-busiest airport in the nation, the busiest airport in the Washington metropolitan area, and the second busiest in the Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area, the airport served over 25.4 million passengers in 2023. The airport&#x27;s main runway is the busiest in the nation.

In 2024, DCA set an all-time record serving 26.29 passengers, breaking the record set in 2023, an increase of 3.3%.

==History==
===20th century===
The first airport in the area was Arlington&#x27;s Hoover Field, which opened in 1926. Near the present site of the Pentagon, its single runway was crossed by a street; guards had to stop automobile traffic during takeoffs and landings. The following year, in 1927, Washington Airport, another privately operated field, began service next door. In 1930, the Great Depression led the two terminals to merge to form Washington-Hoover Airport. Bordered on the east by U.S. Route 1, with its accompanying high-tension electrical wires, and obstructed by a high smokestack on one approach and a dump nearby, the field was inadequate.


The need for a better airport was acknowledged in 37 studies conducted between 1926 and 1938, but a statute prohibited federal development of airports. When Congress lifted the prohibition in 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a recess appropriation of $15 million to build National Airport by reallocating funds from other purposes. Construction of Washington National Airport began in 1940–1941 by a company led by John McShain. Congress challenged the legality of FDR&#x27;s recess appropriation, but construction of the new airport continued.

The airport is located southwest of Washington, D.C., in the Crystal City section of Arlington County, Virginia, adjacent to National Landing. The western part of the airport was once within a large Virginia plantation, a remnant of which is now inside a historic site near the airport&#x27;s Metrorail station. The eastern part of the airport was built in the District of Columbia on and near mudflats in the tidal Potomac River near Gravelly Point, about from the United States Capitol, using landfill dredged from the Potomac River.

The airport opened June 16, 1941, just before U.S. entry into World War II. The public was entertained by displays of wartime equipment including a captured Japanese Zero war prize flown in with U.S. Navy colors. In 1945 Congress passed a law that established the airport was legally within Virginia, mainly for liquor sales taxation purposes, but under the jurisdiction of the federal government. On July 1 of that year the airport&#x27;s weather station became the official point for D.C. weather observations and records by the National Weather Service, in Washington, D.C.

Until 1946, nonstop airline flights did not reach beyond New York City, Detroit, Cincinnati, Memphis, Atlanta, and Jacksonville. In 1946, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, and Miami were added; nonstops reached Denver in 1951 and Los Angeles in 1954. The April 1957 &quot;Official Airline Guide&quot; shows 316 weekday departures: 95 Eastern (plus six per week to/from South America), 77 American, 61 Capital, 23 National, 17 TWA, 10 United, 10 Delta, 6 Allegheny, 6 Braniff, 5 Piedmont, 3 Northeast and 3 Northwest. Jet flights began in April 1966 (727-200s were not allowed until 1970). In 1974 the airport&#x27;s key carriers were Eastern (20 destinations), United (14 destinations after subsuming Capital) and Allegheny (11 destinations).

The grooving of runway 18–36 to improve traction when wet, in March 1967, was the first at a civil airport in the United States.

Service to the airport&#x27;s Metro station began in 1977.

The Washington National Airport Terminal and South Hangar Line were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

===Expansion and restrictions===
The runway layout has changed little since the 1956 closure of the east–west runway at the south end of the field. Changes to the terminal complex over the years include:
* Extension of the original Main Terminal (today&#x27;s Terminal 1) to the south in 1950
* The construction of a North Terminal supplemented the original terminal in 1958; construction connected the two terminals in 1961.
* A United Airlines holdroom complex was built in 1965, a facility for American Airlines was completed in 1968, and a facility for Northwest Airlines and TWA (still in use today as the Terminal A concourse), along with a commuter terminal in 1970.
* The Metrorail station serving the Airport opened in 1977.
* A major terminal expansion including a new air traffic control tower, officially called Terminals B/C, opened in 1997 giving the terminal its current configuration.
* Runways 18/36 and 03/21 were renumbered as 01/19 and 04/22 in 1999 as Earth&#x27;s magnetic field drifted.
* In March 2012 the main 01/19 runway was lengthened to add Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) compliant runway safety runoff areas.

Despite the expansions, efforts have been made to restrict the growth of the airport. The advent of jets and traffic growth led Congress to pass the Washington Airport Act of 1950, which led to the opening of Dulles International Airport in 1962. To reduce congestion and drive traffic to alternative airports, the FAA imposed perimeter restrictions on National when jets arrived in 1966, and landing slots at DCA and four other high-density airports in 1969.

The airport originally had no perimeter rule; from 1954 to 1960, piston-engine airliners flew nonstop to California. Scheduled jet airliners were not allowed until April 1966, and concerns about aviation noise led to noise restrictions even before jet service began in 1966.

The perimeter rule was implemented in January 1966 as a voluntary agreement by airlines, to get permission to use short-haul jets at National. Dulles was to continue to serve the long haul markets, limiting traffic and noise at National; the FAA assumed that ground level noise would be reduced because planes would take off light on fuel and be up and away quickly. The agreement limited jet flights to , with 7 grandfathered exceptions under . The spirit of the agreement was regularly violated as flights left National to an airport within the perimeter and then immediately took off for a destination beyond it. Within a year there was a proposal to reduce the perimeter to , but it was widely opposed and never implemented. Overcrowding at National was later managed by the 1969 High Density Rule, thereby removing one of the justifications for the perimeter agreement.

In the 1960s and 1970s, several attempts were made to codify the perimeter rule, but it was not until Dulles was endangered that it actually become a strict rule. In 1970 the FAA lifted the ban at National of the stretched Boeing 727-200, which resulted in a lawsuit by Virginians for Dulles who argued that the airport&#x27;s jet traffic was a nuisance. That suit resulted in a Court of Appeals order to create an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In addition to the court order, there were economic problems at Dulles. Following the extension of Metrorail to National in 1977, and airline deregulation in 1978, traffic at Dulles began to plummet while it increased at National. As part of a slate of efforts to protect Dulles, including removing landing fees and mobile lounge user charges, the FAA proposed regulations as part of the EIS to limit traffic at National and maintain Dulles&#x27;s role as the area&#x27;s airport for long-haul destinations. In 1980, the FAA proposed codifying the perimeter rule as part of a larger rulemaking effort. When the rule was announced, airlines challenged it in court; the Metropolitan Washington Airports Policy of 1981 codified the perimeter rule on an interim basis &quot;to maintain the long-haul nonstop service at Dulles and BWI which otherwise would preempt shorter haul service at National.&quot; At the same time, the perimeter was extended to miles to remove the unfairness of having seven grandfathered cities. The perimeter rule was upheld by the Court of Appeals in 1982. In 1986, as part of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act, which handed control of National over to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, the perimeter was extended to to allow nonstop flights to Houston with Dallas also being permitted to be served nonstop.

Slots at the airport have been traded in several instances. In 2011 US Airways acquired a number of Delta&#x27;s slots at Reagan National in exchange for Delta receiving a number of US Airways slots at LaGuardia Airport in New York. JetBlue paid $40 million to acquire eight slot pairs at auction in the same year. JetBlue and Southwest acquired 12 and 27 US Airways slot pairs, respectively, in 2014 as part of a government-mandated divestiture following the merger of US Airways and American.

The airport has three intersecting runways - 01/19 (), 15/33 () and 04/22 (). All aircraft typically use Runway 01/19, although Commuter and General Aviation aircraft sometimes use Runway 15/33, when requested by ATC due to traffic volume or when winds favor that runway. Runway 04 is sometimes used for departures.

===Transfer of control and renaming===

In 1984, the Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole appointed a commission to study transferring National and Dulles Airports from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to a local entity, which could use airport revenues to finance improvements. The commission recommended that one multi-state agency administer both Dulles and National, over the alternative of having Virginia control Dulles and the District of Columbia control National. In 1987 Congress, through legislation, transferred control of the airport from the FAA to the new Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority with the Authority&#x27;s decisions being subject to a Congressional review panel. The constitutionality of the review panel was later challenged in the Supreme Court and the Court has twice declared the oversight panel unconstitutional. Even after this decision, however, Congress has continued to intervene in the management of the airports.

On February 6, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed legislation changing the airport&#x27;s name from Washington National Airport to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, to honor the former president on his 87th birthday. The legislation was drafted against the wishes of MWAA officials and political leaders in Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. Opponents of the renaming argued that a large federal office building had already been named for Reagan, the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, and that the airport was already named for George Washington, the first United States president.

The bill stated that it did not require the expenditure of any funds to accomplish the name change; however, state, regional, and federal authorities were later required to change highway and transit signs at their own additional expense as new signs were made.

===21st century===
In 2015, &quot;The Express&quot; conducted an online survey asking people what they call &quot;the airport in Northern Virginia that&#x27;s not Dulles&quot;. The results found that only 31% of people referred to the airport as &quot;Reagan&quot; and only 12% as &quot;Reagan National&quot;, compared to 57% dropping the former president from the name. Political preference was shown to have a direct correlation with how people called the airport, with 72% of Republicans referring to the airport using &quot;Reagan,&quot; while 64% of Democrats call it &quot;National&quot; or &quot;DCA.&quot;

====Concerns about air traffic risks====
On March 23, 2011, the air traffic control supervisor on duty reportedly fell asleep during the night shift. Two aircraft on approach to the airport were unable to contact anyone in the control tower and landed unassisted.

On January 31, 2025, the FAA announced they would restrict helicopter flights from the airport following a mid-air collision two days prior. This had taken place over the Potomac River and involved American Eagle Flight No. 5342, which had arrived from Wichita, Kansas and was set to land at the airport, and a Sikorsky H-60 U.S. Army helicopter undergoing a training exercise, which had previously taken off from Reagan National Airport. The incident was the first major U.S. commercial airliner crash since the 2009 crash near Buffalo, New York. Following the collision, it was noted the airport was also facing scrutiny related to other incidents causing concern over air traffic safety risks, including a May 29, 2024 incident which had involved two planes nearly colliding on the airport&#x27;s runway, and an incident on January 28, 2025 which involved a jet being forced to abort its first landing attempt at the airport.

===Construction of current terminal buildings===

With the addition of more flights and limited space in the aging main terminal, the airport began an extensive renovation and expansion in the 1990s. Hangar 11 on the northern end of the airport was converted into The USAir Interim Terminal, designed by Joseph C. Giuliani, FAIA. Soon after an addition for Delta Air Lines was added in 1989 and was later converted to Authority offices. These projects allowed for the relocation of several gates in the main terminal until the new $450 million terminal complex became operational. On July 27, 1997, the new terminal complex, Terminal 2, and two parking garages, opened. Argentine architect César Pelli designed the new terminals of the airport. The Interim Terminal closed immediately after its opening and was converted back into a hangar. One pier of the main terminal (now widely known as Terminal A), which mainly housed American Airlines and Pan Am, was demolished; the other pier, originally designed by Giuliani Associates Architects for Northwest and TWA remains operational today as gates A1–A9.

MWAA began construction of a new concourse north of Terminal 2 in February 2018 to accommodate 14 new regional jet gates with jetways, bringing the total number of gates at DCA to 60. This replaced &quot;Gate 35X,&quot; a bus gate formerly used to bring passengers to and from American Eagle flights that used parking spots on the ramp. Officially called Project Journey, construction was completed on April 20, 2021. In addition, the individual security checkpoints for the four concourses in Terminal 2 were replaced with higher-capacity security checkpoints in two new buildings to the west of National Hall, located next to the two Metro station pedestrian bridges, and in between the two existing arrivals and departures roadways, placing all of National Hall within the secured area of the airport and allowing passengers to walk between concourses without re-clearing security. The new checkpoints were opened on November 9, 2021.

A land bridge is planned which would connect the airport with National Landing directly to Amazon HQ2.

==Operations==
===Perimeter restrictions===
Washington National Airport is subject to a federally mandated perimeter limitation to keep it a short-haul airport and to keep most long-haul air traffic to Dulles International Airport. The rule was implemented in 1966 and originally limited nonstop service to , with some exceptions for previously existing service. Congress extended the limit in the 1980s to and then again to . Congress and the United States Department of Transportation have created many &quot;beyond-perimeter&quot; exceptions that have weakened the rule.

Members of Congress repeatedly have sought to extend the limit and permit exceptions in order to allow nonstop service from National Airport to their home states and districts. In 1999, Senator John McCain of Arizona introduced legislation to remove the restriction. In the end the restriction was not lifted, but in 2000 the FAA was permitted to add 24 exemptions, which went to Alaska Airlines for flights to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. America West later obtained exemptions for non-stop flights to Phoenix in 2004. In May 2012, the DOT granted new exemptions for Alaska to serve Portland, JetBlue to serve San Juan, Southwest to serve Austin and Virgin America to serve San Francisco. American, Delta, United and US Airways were also each allowed to exchange a pair of in-perimeter slots for an equal number of beyond-perimeter slots.

In 2023, members of Congress from Texas, including Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, along with Representatives Chip Roy and Greg Casar, proposed softening the perimeter rules in an FAA reauthorization bill. The efforts were opposed by senators from Virginia and Maryland, along with American Airlines (which has a hub at Reagan) and United Airlines (which has a hub at Dulles), citing an FAA memo and statistics showing that Reagan has a high rate of delays and that additional flights may exceed its capacity. Controversy over the proposal held up the bill for a year. In 2024, a deal was reached to add five additional perimeter-exempt roundtrip slots to Reagan to the FAA authorization bill, which ultimately passed Congress and was signed by President Joe Biden. After the bill was signed, airlines began applying for the new slots. The U.S. Department of Transportation issued permits for new daily roundtrip destinations to Alaska Airlines for San Diego, which was previously served by US Airways; American Airlines for San Antonio, the second-largest market without an existing non-stop flight; Delta Air Lines for Seattle, as the second carrier on the route; Southwest for Las Vegas, as the second carrier on the route; and United Airlines for San Francisco, for an additional roundtrip to the city which it was already serving from Reagan. Applications for the new slots from Frontier Airlines, JetBlue Airlines, and Spirit Airlines were rejected.

===Approach patterns===
Reagan National Airport has some of the strictest noise restrictions in the country. In addition, due to security concerns, the areas surrounding the National Mall and U.S. Naval Observatory in central Washington are prohibited airspace up to . Due to these restrictions, pilots approaching from the north are generally required to follow the path of the Potomac River and turn just before landing. This approach is known as the &quot;River Visual&quot;. Similarly, flights taking off to the north are required to climb quickly and turn left.

The River Visual airport approach is only possible with a ceiling of at least and visibility of or more. There are lights on the Key Bridge, Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, Arlington Memorial Bridge and the George Mason Memorial Bridge to aid pilots following the river. Aircraft using the approach can be observed from various parks on the river&#x27;s west bank. Passengers on the left side of an airplane can see the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the World War II Memorial, Georgetown University, the National Mall, portions of Downtown Washington, D.C. (including the roof of Capital One Arena), and the White House. Passengers on the right side can see Central Intelligence Agency headquarters, Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon, eastern Arlington, including portions of Rosslyn, Clarendon, Ballston, Crystal City, and the United States Air Force Memorial.

When the River Visual is not available due to visibility or winds, aircraft may fly an offset localizer or GPS approach to Runway 19 along a similar course (flying a direct approach course on instruments as far as Rosslyn, and then turning to align with the runway visually moments before touchdown). Most airliners are also capable of performing a VOR or GPS approach to the shorter Runway 15/33. Northbound visual and ILS approaches to Runway 1 are also sometimes used; these approaches follow the Potomac River from the south and overfly the Woodrow Wilson Bridge.

===Special security measures===
In 1938, Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 7910, creating the first restricted airspace around the District of Columbia. This would be superseded by a number of executive orders clarifying the boundaries of the airspace until 1966, when it was codified into Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, part 73. Title 14 created Prohibited Airspace 56 A and B (P-56A and P-56B). P-56A restricted flight around the National Mall, White House, and United States Capitol Building, while P-56B restricted flight in a half-mile radius from the center of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Only aircraft supporting the United States Secret Service, Office of the President, or some government agencies are permitted within the prohibited airspace.

In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, a Flight-Restricted Zone (FRZ) was put into effect. Extending approximately 15 nautical miles (or roughly 17 miles) around the airport, only scheduled commercial flights and governmental flights are allowed into the zone without a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration. Charter flights for the U.S. government are permitted to land at the airport and Joint Base Andrews under certain conditions.

After the September 11 attacks, the airport was closed for several weeks, and security was tightened when it reopened. Increased security measures included:
* A ban on aircraft with more than 156 seats (lifted on April27, 2002)
* A ban on the &quot;River Visual&quot; approach (lifted on April27, 2002)
* A requirement that, 30 minutes prior to landing or following takeoff, passengers were required to remain seated; if anyone stood up, the aircraft was to be diverted to Washington Dulles International Airport under military escort and the person standing would be detained and questioned by federal law enforcement officials (lifted in July 2005)
* A ban on general aviation (lifted in October 2005, subject to the restrictions below)
On October 18, 2005, National Airport was reopened to general aviation on a limited basis (48 operations per day) and under restrictions: passenger and crew manifests must be submitted to the Transportation Security Administration 24 hours in advance, and all planes must pass through one of roughly 70 &quot;gateway airports&quot; where re-inspections of aircraft, passengers, and baggage take place. An armed security officer must be on board before departing a gateway airport. 

==Terminals and facilities==

DCA has 59 gates with jetways: 9 gates in Terminal 1 and 50 gates in Terminal 2 (13 gates in Concourse B, 12 in Concourse C, 11 in Concourse D, and 14 in Concourse E). The two terminals are not connected to each other post-security.
A new terminal and gate numbering scheme was implemented in 2022. Previously Terminal 1 was Terminal A, and Terminal 2 was Terminal B/C as it is one building. All gates also now have a letter, A through E for each of the five concourses. Therefore, Gate 33 became Gate C33. Other changes include B Parking and C Parking, becoming Parking 2 South and Parking 2 North.

===Terminal 1===

Designed by architect Charles M. Goodman, terminal 1 opened in 1941 and was expanded in 1955 to accommodate more passengers and airlines. The exterior of this terminal has had its original architecture restored, with the airside façade restored in 2004 and the landside façade restored in 2008. The terminal underwent a $37 million renovation that modernized the airport&#x27;s look by bringing in brighter lighting, more windows, and new flooring. The project was completed in 2014 along with a new expanded TSA security checkpoint. In 2014, additional renovations were announced including new upgraded concessions and further structural improvements, the project was completed in 2015. 

Terminal 1 contains gates A1–A9. It houses operations from Air Canada Express, Frontier, and Southwest, with Southwest having the largest presence in Terminal 1.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 is the airport&#x27;s newer and larger terminal; the terminal opened in 1997 and replaced a collection of airline-specific terminals built during the 1960s. The new terminal (Concourses B-D) was designed by architect Cesar Pelli and houses 35 gates. The terminal is directly connected to the WMATA airport station via indoor pedestrian bridges. Concourse E, which expanded Terminal 2, opened in 2021 as a replacement for Gate 35X, which was a bus gate.

Terminal 2 has four concourses. Concourse B (Gates B10–B22) houses Alaska Airlines, Delta, and United. Concourse C (Gates C23–C34) houses American and JetBlue. Concourse D (Gates D35–D45) is exclusive to American for their hub at DCA along with Concourse E (Gates E46–E59) that houses American Eagle and American. The corridor/hall connecting the four concourses of Terminal 2 is known as National Hall. 

===Lounges===
There are several airport lounges at the airport. There are three American Airlines Admirals Clubs in Terminal 2: one near gate C24 in Concourse C, one in Concourse D near gate D36, and one in Concourse E near gate E47. In Terminal 2, Concourse B, there is a Delta Sky Club near gate B15 and a United Club near gate B10. In Terminal 1, there is a USO lounge for retired and active military members pre-security. Originally scheduled for 2022, an American Express Centurion Lounge is in National Hall by the B Gates, which opened on July 17, 2024. The Capital One Landing lounge, a collaboration with chef José Andrés, opened in November 2024 in Terminal 2, Concourse D.

===Ground transportation===

The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport station on the Washington Metro, served by the Yellow and Blue lines, is located on an elevated outdoor platform station adjacent to Terminal 2. Two elevated pedestrian walkways connect the station directly to the concourse levels of Terminal 2. An underground pedestrian walkway and shuttle services provide access to Terminal 1.

Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is located on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, and connected to U.S. Route 1 by the Airport Viaduct (State Route 233). Interstate 395 is just north of the airport, and is also accessible by the G.W. Parkway and U.S. Route 1. Airport-operated parking garage facilities as well as economy lots are available adjacent to or near the various airport terminals.

The airport is accessible by bicycle and foot from the Mount Vernon Trail, as well as the sidewalk along the Airport Viaduct (State Route 233), which connects the airport grounds to U.S. Route 1. A total of 48 bike parking spots are available across six separate bike racks. The airport has a Capital Bikeshare station, making this the first major airport in the United States to have a dock-based bikeshare station.

==Abingdon plantation historical site==
A part of the airport is located on the former site of the 18th and 19th century Abingdon plantation, which was associated with the prominent Alexander, Custis, Stuart, and Hunter families. In 1998, MWAA opened a historical display around the restored remnants of two Abingdon buildings and placed artifacts collected from the site in an exhibit hall in Terminal A. The Abingdon site is located on a knoll between parking Garage A and Garage B/C, near the south end of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Metrorail station.

==Accidents and incidents==
===Page Airways===
On April 27, 1945, a Page Airways Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar on a charter flight crashed into a deep ditch at the end of runway 33 after aborting a takeoff due to engine failure. There were strong gusts and ground turbulence at the time. Out of the 13 passengers and crew on board, six passengers were killed. Although a contemporary newspaper report indicated that the flight&#x27;s intended destination had been Rochester, New York, the Civil Aeronautics Board&#x27;s accident investigation report stated that the destination had been New York, N.Y.

===TWA Flight 955===

On March 29, 1946, a TWA Lockheed L-049 Constellation struck a concrete transformer house after going off the runway. The plane landed fast and with the flaps still extending. All 12 passengers and crew survived, but the aircraft was destroyed and written off. 

===Eastern Air Lines Flight 537===
On November 1, 1949, a mid-air collision between an Eastern Air Lines passenger aircraft and a P-38 Lightning military plane took the lives of 55 passengers. The sole survivor was the Bolivian pilot of the fighter plane, Erick Rios Bridoux.

Bridoux&#x27;s plane had taken off from National just 10 minutes earlier and was in contact with the tower during a brief test flight. The Eastern Air Lines DC-4 was on approach from the south when the nimble and much faster P-38 banked and plunged right into the passenger plane. Both aircraft dropped into the Potomac River.

===Capital Airlines Flight 500===
On December 12, 1949, Capital Airlines Flight 500, a Douglas DC-3, stalled and crashed into the Potomac River while on approach to Washington National. Six of the 23 passengers and crew on board were killed.

===Air Florida Flight 90===
On the afternoon of January 13, 1982, following a period of exceptionally cold weather and a morning of blizzard conditions, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed after waiting 49 minutes on a taxiway and taking off with ice and snow on the wings. The Boeing 737 aircraft failed to gain altitude. Less than from the end of the runway, the airplane struck the 14th Street Bridge complex, shearing the tops off vehicles stuck in traffic before plunging through the ice covering the Potomac River. Rescue responses were greatly hampered by the weather and traffic. Due to action on the part of motorists, a United States Park Service police helicopter crew, and one of the plane&#x27;s passengers who later died, five occupants of the downed plane survived. The other 74 people who were aboard and four occupants of vehicles on the bridge were killed. President Ronald Reagan praised motorist Lenny Skutnik in his State of the Union Address a few weeks later.

===American Eagle Flight 5342===
On 29 January 2025, American Eagle Flight 5342 carrying 64 people collided with a Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter while approaching Reagan Airport, causing both aircraft to crash into the Potomac River. All 67 passengers and crew on both aircraft were killed (64 on the CRJ700 and three on the Black Hawk).

<text>The patricians (from ) were originally a group of ruling class families in ancient Rome. The distinction was highly significant in the Roman Kingdom and the early Republic, but its relevance waned after the Conflict of the Orders (494 BC to 287 BC). By the time of the late Republic and Empire, membership in the patriciate was of only nominal significance. The social structure of ancient Rome revolved around the distinction between the patricians and the plebeians. The status of patricians gave them more political power than the plebeians, but the relationship between the groups eventually caused the Conflict of the Orders. This time period resulted in changing of the social structure of ancient Rome.

After the Western Empire fell, the term &quot;patrician&quot; continued as a high honorary title in the Eastern Empire. In many medieval Italian republics, especially in Venice and Genoa, medieval patrician classes were once again formally defined groups of leading families. In the Holy Roman Empire, the Grand Burgher families had a similar meaning. Subsequently, &quot;patrician&quot; became a vague term used to refer to aristocrats and the higher bourgeoisie in many countries.

==Origin==
According to Livy, the first hundred men appointed senators by Romulus were referred to as &quot;fathers&quot; (Latin &quot;patres&quot;), and the descendants of those men became the patrician class. This account is also described by Cicero. The appointment of these one hundred men into the Senate gave them a noble status. That status is what separated the patricians from the plebeians. Some accounts detail that the one hundred men were chosen because of their wisdom. This would coincide with the idea that ancient Rome was founded on a merit-based ideal. According to other opinions, the patricians () were those who could point to fathers, i.e., those who were members of the clans () whose members originally comprised the whole citizen body.

Other noble families that came to Rome during the time of the kings were also admitted to the patriciate, including several who emigrated from Alba Longa, after that city was destroyed by Tullus Hostilius. The last-known instance of a gens being admitted to the patriciate prior to the first century BC was when the Claudii were added to the ranks of the patricians after coming to Rome in 504 BC, five years after the establishment of the Republic. 

The criteria applied by Romulus to choose certain men for this class remain contested by academics and historians, but the importance of the patrician/plebeian distinction is accounted by all as paramount to ancient Roman society. The distinction between the noble class, the patricians, and the Roman populace, the plebeians, existed from the beginning of ancient Rome. This distinction became increasingly important in the society until the period of the late republic. 

The patricians were given noble status when named to the Senate, giving them wider political influence than the plebeians, at least in the times of the early Republic. The patricians in ancient Rome were of the same status as aristocrats in Greek society. Being of the noble class meant that patricians were able to participate in government and politics, while the plebeians could not. This privilege was important in ancient Roman history and eventually caused a large divide between the two classes. 

During the middle and late Republic, as this influence gradually eroded, plebeians were granted equal rights in most areas, and even greater in some. For example, only plebeians could serve as the tribune of the plebs. There were quotas for official offices. One of the two consulships was reserved for plebeians. Although being a patrician remained prestigious, it was of minimal practical importance. With the exception of some religious offices which were devoid of political power, plebeians were able to stand for all of the offices that were open to patricians. Plebeians of the senatorial class were no less wealthy than patricians at the height of the republic. Originally patrician, Publius Clodius Pulcher willingly arranged to be adopted by a plebeian family in order to qualify to be appointed as the tribune of the plebs.

== Roman Republic and Empire ==

===Status===
Patricians historically had more privileges and rights than plebeians. This status difference was marked at the beginning of the Republic: patricians were better represented in the Roman assemblies, and only patricians could hold high political offices, such as dictator, consul, and censor, and all priesthoods (such as pontifex maximus) were closed to non-patricians. There was a belief that patricians communicated better with the Roman gods, so they alone could perform the sacred rites and take the auspices.

Additionally, not only were the patricians of higher status in political offices but they also had the best land in ancient Rome. Having the best land allowed the patrician class to have more opportunities, such as being able to produce better agriculture. This view had political consequences, since in the beginning of the year or before a military campaign, Roman magistrates used to consult the gods. Livy reports that the first admission of plebeians into a priestly college happened in 300 BC with the passage of the Lex Ogulnia when the College of Augurs raised their number from four to nine. After that, plebeians were accepted into the other religious colleges. By the end of the Republic, only priesthoods with limited political importance, such as the Salii, the Flamines, and the Rex Sacrorum, were filled exclusively by patricians.

While it was not illegal for a plebeian to run for political office, a plebeian would not have had the backing needed to win a seat. Since society was organized in this way, the patrician class was essentially in control of ancient Rome&#x27;s government. In Cassius&#x27; accounts of ancient Rome, he details how important and advantaged the patrician class was over the plebeian class. He indicates the status difference between patricians and plebeians by detailing the specific shoes the patricians wore. Cassius states, &quot;For the shoes worn by the patricians in the city were ornamented with laced straps and the design of the letter, to signify that they were descended from the original hundred men that had been senators.&quot; It is clear through Cassius&#x27; account that these details mattered and represented the differentiation between classes.

Few plebeian names appear in lists of Roman magistrates during the early Republic. Two laws passed during the fourth century BC began the gradual opening of magistrates to the plebeians: the Lex Licinia Sextia of 367 BC, which established the right of plebeians to hold the consulship; and the Genucian Law of 342 BC, which required that at least one of the consuls be a plebeian (although this law was frequently violated for several decades).

Many of the ancient patrician gentes whose members appear in the founding legends of Rome disappeared as Rome acquired its empire, and new plebeian families rose to prominence. A number of patrician families such as the Horatii, Lucretii, Verginii and Menenii rarely appear in positions of importance during the later republic. Many old families had patrician and plebeian branches, of which the patrician lines frequently faded into obscurity, and were eclipsed by their plebeian namesakes.

The decline accelerated toward the end of the Republic, principally because of the civil wars, from the Social War to the proscriptions of the Triumvirs, which took a heavy toll on them. As a result, several illustrious patrician houses were on the verge of extinction during the first century BC, sometimes only surviving through adoptions, such as:

* Julii Caesares
* Manlii Torquatii
* Cornelii Scipiones
* Papirii Masones
* Postumii Albini
* Servilii Caepiones

However, large gentes with multiple seem to have coped better; the Aemilii, Claudii, Cornelii, Fabii, Sulpicii, and Valerii all continued to thrive under the Principate.

=== Patricians vs. plebeians ===
The distinction between patricians and plebeians in ancient Rome was based purely on birth. Although modern writers often portray patricians as rich and powerful families who managed to secure power over the less-fortunate plebeian families, plebeians and patricians among the senatorial class were equally wealthy. As civil rights for plebeians increased during the middle and late Roman Republic, many plebeian families had attained wealth and power while some traditionally patrician families had fallen into poverty and obscurity. However, no amount of wealth could change one&#x27;s class.

=== Marriage ===
A marriage between a patrician and a plebeian was the only way to legally integrate the two classes. However, when the Twelve Tables were written down, the marriage between the two classes was prohibited. 
This was repealed in 445 BC with the Lex Canuleia. If a marriage was to occur between a patrician and a plebeian, the children of that marriage would then be given patrician status. This law was created to prevent the classes from mixing. In ancient Rome women did not have power in the household. However, according to Mathisen, having a recognized marriage, so not illegally marrying into the other class, was important. Having a legally recognized marriage ensured that the children born from the marriage were given Roman citizenship and any property they might inherit.

=== Conflict of the Orders ===
Eventually, the plebeians became unsatisfied with being the lower class and not having the same rights and privileges as the patricians. This time in Roman history is called the Conflict of the Orders, which took place between 500 and 287 BC. Due to the patricians having the political status, the plebeian class had no representation in the government to advocate for their interests. By not having anyone advocating for their interests, this also meant that the plebeians did not always know the laws by which they had to abide. Since the patricians were of high social status, they did not want to lose this status; they were not in agreement with changing the structure of society by giving plebeians more status. Eventually, the plebeian class created their own governing body, the Council of the Plebs. 

Another advancement that came from the Conflict of the Orders was the Twelve Tables. At this time in ancient Rome, the monarchy had been overthrown. The plebeians wanted to know the laws, which resulted in the written form of laws: the Twelve Tables. Even once these laws were written down, and the new Centuriate Assembly was created, the patrician class remained in power. The assembly separated citizens into classes, however, the top two classes, Equites and Patricians, controlled the majority of the vote. This meant, that while the plebeians were able to vote, if the patrician classes voted together, they could control the vote. Ancient Rome, according to Ralph Mathisen, author of &quot;Ancient Roman Civilization: History and Sources,&quot; made political reforms, such as the introduction of the Council of the Plebs and the tribunes of the plebs. These two political bodies were created to give the plebeians a voice. After the Conflict of the Orders, according to Mathisen, Plebeians were able to rise in politics and become members of the Senate, which previously had been exclusively for patricians.

=== Fading of distinction ===
A series of laws diminished the distinction between the two classes, including &quot;Lex Canuleia&quot; (445 BC; which allowed the marriage—&quot;ius connubii&quot;—between patricians and plebeians), &quot;Leges Liciniae Sextiae&quot; (367 BC; which made restrictions on possession of public lands—&quot;ager publicus&quot;—and also made sure that one of the consuls was plebeian), &quot;Lex Ogulnia&quot; (300 BC; plebeians received access to priest posts), and &quot;Lex Hortensia&quot; (287 BC; verdicts of plebeian assemblies—&quot;plebiscita&quot;—now bind all people). Gradually, by the late Republic, most distinctions between patricians and plebeians had faded away.

By Julius Caesar&#x27;s time so few of the patriciate were left that a special law was made, the &quot;Lex Cassia&quot;, for the enrollment of new patricians. This was followed by Augustus under the &quot;Lex Saenia&quot;, and continued by later emperors such as Claudius. The last patrician families of the Republic went extinct in the Imperial period, and the latest known members of the &quot;original&quot; patrician houses are Servius Cornelius Dolabella Metilianus Pompeius Marcellus or possibly the Cornelii Scipiones Salvidieni Orfiti.

=== Modern day ===
&quot;Patrician&quot; and &quot;plebeian&quot; are still used today to refer to groups of people of high and lower classes.

===Patrician families===
The following were regarded as patrician, although they may have had plebeian members or branches.

* Aebutia
* Aemilia
* Aquillia
* Aternia
* Atilia

* Junia
* Marcia

====Gentes maiores et minores====
Among the patricians, certain families were known as the , the greatest or perhaps the most noble houses. The other patrician families were called the . Whether this distinction had any legal significance is not known, but it has been suggested that the , or Speaker of the Senate, was traditionally chosen from the .

No list of the gentes maiores has been discovered, and even their number is unknown. It has been suggested that the Aemilii, Claudii, Cornelii, Fabii, Manlii, and Valerii were amongst them. The &quot;Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&quot; suggests that the gentes maiores consisted of families that settled at Rome in the time of Romulus, or at least before the destruction of Alba Longa. The noble Alban families that settled in Rome in the time of Tullus Hostilius then formed the nucleus of the gentes minores. These included the Julii, Tulii, Servilii, Quinctii, Geganii, Curtii, and Cloelii.

However, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Dictionary of Classical Antiquities&quot; suggests that the Alban families were also included among the gentes maiores, and that the gentes minores consisted of the families admitted to the patriciate under the Tarquins and in the early years of the Republic. In any case, the distinction cannot have been based entirely on priority, because the Claudii did not arrive at Rome until after the expulsion of the kings.

==Late Roman and Byzantine period==
Patrician status still carried a degree of prestige at the time of the early Roman Empire, and Roman emperors routinely elevated their supporters to the patrician caste &quot;en masse&quot;. This prestige gradually declined further, and by the end of the Crisis of the Third Century patrician status, as it had been known in the Republic, ceased to have meaning in everyday life. The emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) reintroduced the term as the empire&#x27;s senior honorific title, not tied to any specific administrative position, and from the first limited to a very small number of holders. The historian Zosimus states that in Constantine&#x27;s time, the holders of the title ranked even above the praetorian prefects.

In the late Western Roman Empire, the title was sparingly used and retained its high prestige, being awarded, especially in the fifth century, to the powerful who dominated the state, such as Stilicho, Constantius III, Flavius Aetius, Comes Bonifacius, and Ricimer. The patrician title was occasionally used in Western Europe after the end of the Roman Empire; for instance, Pope Stephen II granted the title &quot;Patricius of the Romans&quot; to the Frankish ruler Pepin the Short. The revival of patrician classes in medieval Italian city-states, and also north of the Alps, is covered in patricianship.

The eastern emperor Zeno (r. 474–491) granted it to Odoacer to legitimize the latter&#x27;s rule in Italy after his overthrow of the rebellious Orestes and his son Romulus Augustulus in 476. In the Eastern Empire, Theodosius II (r. 408–450) barred eunuchs from holding it, although this restriction had been overturned by the sixth century. Under Justinian I (r. 527–565), the title proliferated and was consequently somewhat devalued, as the emperor opened it to all those above rank, i.e. the majority of the Senate.

In the eighth century, in the Eastern Roman Empire, the title was further lowered in the court order of precedence, coming after the and the . However it remained one of the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the eleventh century, being awarded to the most important (provincial governors and generals, allies) of the Empire. In the court hierarchy, the eunuch enjoyed higher precedence, coming before even the . The title was also granted to important allied foreign rulers, as the early Bulgarian ruler Kubrat, whose ring A was inscribed in Greek XOBPATOY and ring C was inscribed XOBPATOY ПATPIKIOY, indicating the dignity of &quot;Patrikios&quot; (Patrician) that he had achieved in the Byzantine world.

According to the late ninth-century , the insignia of the dignity were ivory inscribed tablets. During the eleventh century, the dignity of followed the fate of other titles: extensively awarded, it lost in status, and disappeared during the Komnenian period in the early twelfth century. The title of (, &quot;first patrician&quot;) is also evidenced in the East from 367 to 711, possibly referring to the senior-most holder of the office and leader of the patrician order (). The feminine variant () denoted the spouses of ; it is not to be confused with the title of (&quot;girded &quot;), which was a unique dignity conferred on the ladies-in-waiting of the empress.

<text>Minden-Lübbecke is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the northeastern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring districts are Diepholz, Nienburg, Schaumburg, Lippe, Herford, Osnabrück.

==Geography==
This is the northernmost district of North Rhine-Westphalia. It protrudes into Lower Saxon territory. The Weser River enters the district in the southeast and leaves to the north. In the south of the district the river runs through a narrow gorge, which is formed by two mountain chains, the Wiehen Hills in the west and the Wesergebirge in the east. This gorge is called Porta Westfalica, since it marks the ancient border of Westphalia.

==History==
Minden-Lübbecke is roughly identical with the medieval Bishopric of Minden. At its biggest extent in the 13th century, it later lost territory until it came finally to be around the size of today&#x27;s district. In the 17th century the principality came into the possession of Brandenburg and thus Prussia. Lost for a time to Napoleonic France, it came back to Prussia in 1813, and was then part of the Province of Westphalia. In 1816 the districts of Minden and Rahden were created, but in 1832 the Rahden district was merged with parts of the abolished Bünde district, and the administrative seat of the new district was Lübbecke. The district within today&#x27;s borders was created in 1973 when the two districts of Minden and Lübbecke were merged.

==Miscellaneous==
The district is also known as &quot;Mühlenkreis&quot;, as it has many reconstructed historic mills, many linked by the Westphalian Mill Route.

==Coat of arms==
In the right half of the coat of arms are the chevrons from the arms of the counts of Ravensberg, who owned part of the district&#x27;s land. The keys are the sign of the Prince-Bishops of Minden after their patron Saint Peter. After the district was merged with Lübbecke a second key was added, to symbolize the two historic parts. This new arms were granted in 1973.

==Towns and municipalities==


==Nature reserves==
There are over 60 nature reserves in Minden-Lübbecke district, covering a total of around 7,100 ha, i.e. 6.2% of the district&#x27;s area. The largest are:
* Bastau meadows with 1,778 ha
* Weseraue with 774 ha
* Mindener Wald with 515 ha
* Großes Torfmoor with 511 ha
* Heisterholz with 402 ha
* Staustufe Schlüsselburg with 268 ha
* Am Oppenweher Moor with 255 ha
* Oppenweher Moor with 215 ha

<text>Moira is a former mining village about south-west of Ashby-de-la-Zouch in North West Leicestershire, England. The village is about south of Swadlincote and is close to the boundary with Derbyshire. The population is included in the civil parish of Ashby Woulds.

For centuries North West Leicestershire has been quarried and mined for coal, limestone, granite and brick clay, and its environmental damage was one of the reasons that it was chosen in the 1990s as the site for the National Forest, which is part of a Government-funded programme to create more woodland. Proximate villages include Donisthorpe, Overseal, Oakthorpe and Spring Cottage.

==Etymology==
Moira&#x27;s toponym is derived from the Irish earldom of Moira, one of the titles of the Hastings family, which held Ashby de la Zouch Castle. The former local coal pit, Rawdon Colliery, also bore a Hastings family name.

In 2022, residents were amused when a road sign spelled the name &#x27;Moria&#x27;, suggesting a link with Tolkien&#x27;s fictional Middle-earth.

==History==
The Midland Railway opened its Leicester to Burton upon Trent Line through Moira in 1845. Moira station served the village until British Railways closed it in 1964. The building survives and the line remains open as a freight route.

Rawdon Colliery was worked for about 150 years. Its seams extended from the shaft, and some had been worked twice, recovering lower grade coal. The pit survived Britain&#x27;s pit closure programme in the mid-1980s that followed the miners&#x27; strike, but ran out of viable coal seams. Gases were rarely a hazard, but spontaneous combustion of coal dust was a potential problem.

==Amenities==
The National Forest Millennium Discovery Centre, now called &#x27;Conkers&#x27;, is on the site of Rawdon Colliery. Its visitor centre features a borehole-based heating and cooling system. Moira Junction Local Nature Reserve occupies of former railway sidings nearby.

Moira Furnace is a restored 19th-century blast furnace. A section of the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal adjacent to the furnace has also been restored and rewatered, although it lacks a navigable link to the rest of the system due to the A42 road having been built across its line. The furnace site also has craft workshops and a small nature reserve.

Both the Youth Hostels Association&#x27;s National Forest youth hostel and the Camping and Caravanning Club&#x27;s National Forest campsite are in Moira and opened in 2008.

There is a Co-Operative supermarket on Shortheath Road, which was given a new frontage in 2016.

The Hicks Lodge nature reserve lies approximately 1 mile east of the village.

<text>Daphne Blake Oram (31 December 1925 – 5 January 2003) was a British composer and electronic musician. She was one of the first British composers to produce electronic sound, and was an early practitioner of &quot;musique concrète&quot; in the UK. As a co-founder of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, she was central to the development of British electronic music. Her uncredited scoring work on the 1961 film &quot;The Innocents&quot; helped to pioneer the electronic soundtrack.

Oram was the creator of the Oramics technique for graphical sound. She was the first woman to independently direct and set up a personal electronic music studio, and the first woman to design and construct an electronic musical instrument. In her book &quot;An Individual Note of Music, Sound and Electronics&quot; (1971) she explored philosophical themes related to acoustics and electronic composition.

== Early life and education ==
Oram was born to James and Ida Oram on 31 December 1925 in Devizes, Wiltshire, England. Her childhood home was within 10 miles of the stone circles of Avebury and 20 miles from Stonehenge. Her father was the President of the Wiltshire Archeological Society in the 1950s. Educated at Sherborne School for Girls in Dorset, she was taught piano, organ and musical composition from an early age. 

== Career ==
=== Work at the BBC ===
In 1942, Oram was offered a place at the Royal College of Music, but instead took up a position as a Junior Studio Engineer and &quot;music balancer&quot; at the BBC. One of her job responsibilities was &quot;shadowing&quot; live concerts with a pre-recorded version so the broadcast would go on if interrupted by &quot;enemy action&quot;. Other job duties included creating sound effects for radio shows and mixing broadcast levels. During this period she became aware of developments in electronic sound and began experimenting with tape recorders, often staying after hours to work late into the night. She recorded sounds on to tape, and then cut, spliced and looped, slowed them down, sped up, and played them backwards.

Oram also dedicated time in the 1940s to composing music, including an electroacoustic work entitled &quot;Still Point&quot;. This was an innovative piece for turntables, &quot;double orchestra&quot; and five microphones. Many consider &quot;Still Point&quot; the first composition that combined acoustic orchestration with live electronic manipulation. Rejected by the BBC and never performed during Oram&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;Still Point&quot; remained unheard for 70 years; on 24 June 2016 composer Shiva Feshareki and the London Contemporary Orchestra performed it for the first time. Following the discovery of the finalised score, the premiere of the revised version of &quot;Still Point&quot; was performed at the BBC Proms in London on 23 July 2018 by Feshareki and James Bulley with the LCO.

In the 1950s, Oram was promoted to a music studio manager at the BBC. Following a trip to the RTF studios in Paris, she began to campaign for the BBC to provide electronic music facilities, utilizing electronic music and &quot;musique concrète&quot; techniques, for use in its programming. In 1957 she was commissioned to compose music for a production of the play &quot;Amphitryon 38.&quot; She created this piece using a sine wave oscillator, a tape recorder and self-designed filters, thereby producing the first wholly electronic score in BBC history. Along with fellow electronic musician and BBC colleague Desmond Briscoe, she began to receive commissions for many other works, including a production of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;All That Fall&quot; (1957). As demand grew for these electronic sounds, the BBC gave Oram and Briscoe a budget to establish the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in early 1958, where she was the first Studio Manager. The workshop was focused on creating sound effects and theme music for all of the BBC&#x27;s output, including the science fiction TV serial &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; (1958–59) and the sounds of &quot;Major Bloodnok&#x27;s Stomach&quot; for the radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot;.

In October 1958, Oram was sent by the BBC to the &quot;Journées Internationales de Musique Expérimentale&quot; at Expo 58 in Brussels, where Edgard Varèse presented his electroacoustic work &quot;Poème électronique&quot; in the Philips Pavilion (alongside Pavilion architect Iannis Xenakis&#x27; piece &quot;Concret PH&quot;). After hearing some of the work produced by her contemporaries, and unhappy with the BBC&#x27;s continued refusal to push electronic composition into the foreground of their activities, she decided to resign from the Radiophonic Workshop less than one year after it had opened, hoping to develop her techniques further on her own.

In 1965, Oram produced the piece &quot;Pulse Persephone&quot; for the &quot;Treasures of the Commonwealth&quot; exhibition at the Royal Academy of the Arts.
=== Film ===
Oram provided the prominent electronic sounds for the soundtrack of &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) from her six-minute work &quot;Atoms in Space&quot;, but she was not credited in the film. These sounds were also used in the following two James Bond films. Oram also manipulated Johnny Hawksworth&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Snow&quot; (1963), a short documentary by Geoffrey Jones; after the success of &quot;Snow&quot;, she worked with Jones again on &quot;Rail&quot; (1967).

=== Oramics ===

Immediately after leaving the BBC in 1959, Oram established the Oramics Studios for Electronic Composition in Tower Folly, a converted oast house at Fairseat, Kent, near Wrotham.

Oramics, which Oram devised along with engineer Graham Wrench, is a graphical sound technique that involves drawing directly onto 35mm film. Shapes and designs for various parameters of sound etched into the film strips are read by photo-electric cells and transformed into sounds. According to Oram, &quot;Every nuance, every subtlety of phrasing, every tone gradation or pitch inflection must be possible just by a change in the written form.&quot;

Financial pressures meant it was necessary to maintain her work as a commercial composer, and her work covered a wider range than the Radiophonic Workshop. She produced music for not only radio and television but also theatre, short commercial films, sound installations and exhibitions, including electronic sounds for Jack Clayton&#x27;s horror film &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961), concert works such as &quot;Four Aspects&quot; (1960), and collaborations with composers Thea Musgrave and Ivor Walsworth.
In February 1962, Oram was awarded a grant of £3,550 () from the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation to support the development of the Oramics system; a second Gulbenkian grant of £1,000 was awarded in 1965. Oram&#x27;s first composition using the Oramics machine, entitled &quot;Contrasts Essonic&quot;, was recorded in 1963. As the Oramics project evolved, Oram&#x27;s focus turned to the subtle nuances and interactions between sonic parameters, and she applied her research to the nonlinear behavior of the human ear and to perception of the brain&#x27;s apprehension of the world. She used Oramics to study vibrational phenomena, divided into &quot;commercial Oramics&quot; and &quot;mystical Oramics&quot;, and the Oramics machine became used more for research than composition. In her notes, Oram defined Oramics as &quot;the study of sound and its relationship to life.&quot;

In the mid-1980s Oram worked on a software version of Oramics for the Acorn Archimedes computer using grant money received from the Ralph Vaughan Williams Trust. She wished to continue her &quot;mystical Oramics&quot; research, but a lack of funding prevented this project from being fully realized.

== Written works ==
Throughout her career, Oram lectured on electronic music and studio techniques. Her book &quot;An Individual Note of Music, Sound and Electronics&quot; (1971) investigates acoustics and the history and techniques of electronic music in a philosophical manner. A new edition of the book was published by Anomie Publishing in December 2016. In the book, Oram characterised her one of her musical machines as a control system that computed the resulting feedback, reflecting the influence of cybernetics, although Oram’s commitment to the composer&#x27;s authorial control set her at odds with the canon of self-generating computer music.

In the late 1970s Oram began a second book, which survives in manuscript, titled &quot;The Sound of the Past - A Resonating Speculation&quot;. In this manuscript she speculates on archaeological acoustics, and presents a theory suggesting that Neolithic chambered cairns and ancient sites such as Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid of Giza were used as acoustic resonators. She said that her research suggested that the people of these eras may have possessed acute knowledge about the properties of sound in long-distance communication.

== Death ==
In the 1990s Oram suffered two strokes and was forced to stop working, later moving to a nursing home. She died in Maidstone, Kent on 5 January 2003, aged 77.

== Archive ==
After Oram&#x27;s death a large archive relating to her life&#x27;s work passed to composer Hugh Davies. When Davies died two years later, this material passed to the Sonic Arts Network, and in 2008 the archive went to Goldsmiths, University of London. It is now held within Goldsmiths Special Collections &amp; Archives, where it is open for public access and ongoing research. The launch of the archive was celebrated with a symposium and a series of concerts at the Southbank Centre. This included a concert of newly reworked versions of material from the collection by People Like Us.

In 2007, a two-CD compilation of her music, entitled &quot;Oramics&quot;, was released.

In 2008, a BBC Radio 3 documentary on Oram&#x27;s life was broadcast as part of the &quot;Sunday Feature&quot; strand, entitled &quot;Wee Have Also Sound-Houses&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Oram&#x27;s work at the Radiophonic Workshop also helped pave the way for Delia Derbyshire, who arrived at the BBC in 1960 and co-composed the original &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme music in 1963.

Oram furthered music philosophy in her writings, and dedicated time to considering the human element in connection to acoustics. In her unfinished manuscript, &quot;The Sound of the Past, a Resonating Speculation&quot;, she postulated that ancient civilizations might have done this to a highly evolved degree. In a letter to Sir George Trevelyan, Oram expressed hope that her work on Oramics would plant seeds that would mature in the 21st century.

The Daphne Oram Creative Arts Building at Canterbury Christ Church University was opened in 2019.

===&quot;Click&quot; tribute===

In its first show of 2012, the BBC television technology programme &quot;Click&quot; featured a piece about Daphne Oram, mainly prompted by the three-part Oramics Machine being on display at the Science Museum, London during a year-long exhibition on the history of electronic music. The programme showed the machine being installed in a large display cabinet, and described how it was no longer possible to play due to its fragile state. However, an interactive, virtual version of the machine has been created, which allows visitors to create their own compositions. The programme showed archive footage of Oram describing the process of what became Oramics, also showing her &#x27;drawing&#x27; the music, then playing her machine. The piece described Oram as an &#x27;unsung hero&#x27; of electronic music.

=== &quot;Daphne Oram&#x27;s Wonderful World of Sound&quot; ===
&quot;Daphne Oram&#x27;s Wonderful World of Sound&quot; is a play that detailed Oram&#x27;s life and career. It was presented by Blood of the Young and Tron Theatre. The play premiered in Glasgow on 9 May 2017 and toured around Scotland from May 2017 to June 2017. The play was written by Isobel McArthur and directed by Paul Brotherston. It was live-scored by Anneke Kampman, a Scottish electronic sound artist.

=== The Oram Awards ===
The annual Oram Awards was launched by the PRS Foundation and the New BBC Radiophonic Workshop to celebrate &quot;emerging artists in the fields of music, sound and related technologies in honour of Daphne Oram, and other pioneering women in music and sound.&quot; The inaugural Oram Awards took place on 3 July 2017 at the Turner Contemporary in Margate, as a part of the Oscillate Festival of Experimental Music and Sound. Two female innovators received a prize of £1,000, while six others received £500.

<text>Steinfurt (; ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Steinfurt. From –1806, it was the capital of the County of Steinfurt.

==Geography==
Steinfurt is situated north-west of Münster, North Rhine-Westphalia. Its name, roughly meaning “stony ford”, came into being in 1975 when the two hitherto independent towns Borghorst and Burgsteinfurt amalgamated. Borghorst became a prosperous city due to its flourishing textile industry, whereas Burgsteinfurt has always rather been characterized by culture and administration. Tourists of the 19th century passing Burgsteinfurt praised the city as the &quot;Paradise of Westphalia&quot; and &quot;Royal Diamond&quot; (&quot;Königsdiamant&quot;) because of its 75 monumental buildings and moated castle.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
Steinfurt borders Ochtrup, Wettringen, Neuenkirchen, Emsdetten, Nordwalde, Altenberge, Laer, Horstmar and Metelen.

===City division===
Steinfurt consists of &quot;Borghorst&quot; and &quot;Burgsteinfurt&quot;, each with three attached farming communities:

* Burgsteinfurt
** Hollich
** Sellen
** Veltrup
* Borghorst
** Dumte
** Wilmsberg
** Ostendorf

==History==

Burgsteinfurt is among the most remarkable places in Münsterland. Predominantly influenced by Protestants, it is home to one of the oldest academies of continuing education in Westphalia. It harbours buildings of all ages and one of the most beautifully moated castles in the entire region. These landmarks distinguish &quot;Stemmert&quot; – as it is often called by its inhabitants – from the neighbouring countryside. Additionally a delightful landscape can be found in Burgsteinfurt, especially the Bagno, a forested amusement park which dates back to the 18th century with one of the oldest free-standing European concert halls.

The origins of Burgsteinfurt are unknown. It is assumed different circumstances led to its foundation, in particular farming, the river Aa and the Order of Saint John.

The Koch Family is an important and substantial part of the community.



The farming communities Hollich, Sellen and Veltrup are significantly older than Burgsteinfurt. The centre of Burgsteinfurt developed around the main farm of &quot;Veltrup,&quot; which already existed in 890 as &quot;villa veliun.&quot; Probably &quot;villa veliun&quot; was the main homestead of a small settlement, which was located on the territory of today&#x27;s inner castle ward. Back then there was a market square at the current castle&#x27;s entrance, which later developed into the &quot;Old Town&quot; of today.

Another settlement not dated back precisely yet was found in the course of archeological excavations in the area of the contemporary &quot;Steintorfeldmark.&quot; All three farming communities had their own sanctuaries in pre-Christian time. After the era of Christianization they built a church in honour of Irish missionaries, which was the predecessor of today&#x27;s Great Protestant Church. The farming communities celebrate their own feasts and customs with their own special atmosphere up to now although they were incorporated into the city in 1939.

Steinfurt&#x27;s name originates from an old stone passage (or &quot;ford&quot;) across the river &quot;Aa.&quot; This passage was probably located at today&#x27;s crossways of &quot;Wasserstraße&quot; and &quot;Europaring.&quot; Being a part of a military formation connecting east and west, it offered one of only few possibilities to cross the river with coaches. The authority controlling the &quot;ford&quot; was powerful, authorised to charge tolls, and fords were also places of commerce. In a document from 1129 there is the first reference to two noblemen &quot;de Steinvorde&quot; (of Steinfurt). They probably had a moated castle built in the place of the main farm of Veltrup near the &quot;ford&quot; in order to control it.

The first rival was the Ascheberg clan living in a castle near today&#x27;s road to Emsdetten, the old road of army and commerce to Münster and other eastern Germanic areas. There was a permanent war between the House of Ascheberg and the House of Steinfurt. In 1164 the Ascheberg clan is said to have destroyed the castle of the Steinfurt clan while the latter were on a trip to Cologne. After their return to Steinfurt they satisfied their desire for revenge and destroyed the castle of Ascheberg.

The noblemen of Steinfurt put forward a liberal settlement policy offering tradesmen, craftsmen and other citizens favourably situated houses near the &quot;ford.&quot; In return they had to provide currency, wax or poultry and the old farming community &quot;Villa Veliun&quot; turned into a market square. In a document from 1338 the settlement is named &quot;unse Stat to Stenvorde&quot; (our city of Stenvorde). From 1816 up to the administrational reform in 1975 the city was called &quot;Burgsteinfurt&quot; and now there is just the city of &quot;Steinfurt&quot; uniting the two parts – Burgsteinfurt and Borghorst.

The Knights of St. John of Jerusalem was a religious and military order of striking importance for Steinfurt, which came to Burgsteinfurt sometime in the 13th century. The knights were given several manors around Steinfurt. Next to the major church the &quot;Knights&quot; founded their settlement called &quot;Kommende&quot; in 1244 of which most of the old buildings have survived until today.

From the 12th century on there was another settlement developed in the neighbourhood of the &quot;Kommende,&quot; which is now the district of Burgsteinfurt called &quot;Friedhof&quot; (free area).

The wealth of the Order of St. John grew continuously. The noblemen gave them authority to supervise the major church, including the prerogative to appoint clergymen and to manage its funds. Additionally they accepted donations of several rich farms as well as possessions in the surrounding area. The settlement of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem in Steinfurt, which was the first settlement of the order in Westphalia, became the biggest one in the region. In Münster they also founded a branch settlement. The Knights of St. John and the &quot;Friedhof&quot; (cemetery)-district formed an important unity. The &quot;Friedhof&quot; (free zone)-district was an independent area outside Steinfurt with its own civil rights. The name &quot;Friedhof&quot; doesn&#x27;t refer to a cemetery, but reminds the reader of a pre-Christian sanctuary, which was located in the place of today&#x27;s &quot;Great Church.&quot; A person reaching this holy place was free; even criminals could not be punished here. In 1347 Steinfurt was granted town privileges. A hundred years later the County of Steinfurt was integrated into the community of counties immediate to the Empire, so that Steinfurt was only subordinate to the Emperor of Germany. Nevertheless, the ambitions of Münster kept growing. The self-government of Steinfurt had always annoyed the bishop of Münster.

But Steinfurt prepared itself. The citizens built walls, ramparts, ditches and so on at their own expense. A complete wall around the city was put up. This fortification consisted of the city wall, the inner moat, the rampart, the outer moat and a forward wall. The course of this fortification can be traced in today&#x27;s cityscape. It develops around the old city centre from the &quot;Schüttenwall&quot; via the &quot;Wilhelmsplatz,&quot; the &quot;Kalkwall,&quot; the &quot;Stampenwall&quot; and the &quot;Neuen Wall.&quot; The small lanes &quot;Türkei,&quot; &quot;Löffelstraße,&quot; &quot;An der Stadtmauer,&quot; &quot;Drepsenhoek&quot; and &quot;Viefhoek&quot; run parallel to the old city wall.

Additionally four city gates were built: &quot;Kirchpforte,&quot; &quot;Rottpforte,&quot; &quot;Steinpforte,&quot; and &quot;Wasserpforte.&quot; There was only a small gate for pedestrians southward to the castle in the &quot;Burgstraße.&quot; The road to Borghorst was built in the 19th century, when the ancient fortification had almost vanished. The &quot;Friedhof&quot;-district had its own fortification – secluded by its own city gate &quot;Blocktor.&quot; The old guarding plans of Steinfurt showed the names of citizens who had to &quot;tho wake und to yse,&quot; i.e., to guard the fortification and keep them clean and to de-ice them. In winter, when the moat was frozen, they had to break up the ice to guarantee the security of the city. Therefore, the citizenship was divided into three boroughs – the so-called &quot;Eise&quot; (Kirchsträßner Eis, Steinsträßner Eis, Wassersträßner Eis).

Simultaneously the city became more prosperous. In 1421 Eberwin I von Götterswick, who ruled Bentheim and Steinfurt since Steinfurt&#x27;s dynasty was extinct, donated the town hall with market stalls of butchers and with a set of scales to the city. All citizens became more and more self-confident. As the Great Church was located outside the fortified city, they built a new Small Church from 1471–1475, on the foundation walls of the poorhouse of the Holy Spirit; until 1807 the annual election of the council took place there on 7 January. Later the Counts of Steinfurt conferred the right to build, and the right to put taxes on routes and beer to the city authorities. In 1561 the citizens proudly built their new town hall, resembling the town hall in Münster, on the foundation walls of the old market hall. This town hall was located at the crossroads of the three main streets from Münster (Wasserstraße), from Coesfeld (Kirchstraße) and from Schüttorf (Steinstraße).

During the aftermath of the Reformation Count Arnold II converted for his wife&#x27;s sake to Lutheranism. This caused tensions with the order of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, which resulted in the assault on the Great Church on 25 January 1564 (Steinfurt Reformation Day). While the count was asleep, the Great Church was taken. From this time on, only Lutheran church services were held in the Great Church and even today the date is known as the &quot;Robber-Feast.&quot; The noble family converted collectively to the Calvinistic Church and stayed alert. From 1591 to 1593 Count Arnold founded a special type of university known as &quot;Hohe Schule,&quot; which was a Protestant institution opposing the Catholic Münster.

Unlike universities recognised by the German Emperor or the Pope the &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; mustn&#x27;t award doctorates. Still this oldest of all Westphalian universities attracted students and scientists from all over Europe; the city became wealthy and famous throughout Germany and the neighbouring countries. Especially Protestant Dutch students appreciated the Hohe Schule. Professor Conrad Vorstius taught there from 1596 until 1605 before he was chosen to become successor of Jacobus Arminius at the Leiden University. Some professors built renaissance-style houses, two of which can still be viewed at the old market square. The Count of Steinfurt even provided cover to Calvinists and Mennonites, who usually came from wealthy families and, therefore, brought many economic resources and also education to Steinfurt. Thus Steinfurt became and remained a Calvinistic-Mennonite island in the centre of Catholic Münsterland for a long time.

But all the prosperity vanished in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The Black Death as well as mercenaries from all over Europe looting the city frightened off many citizens who emigrated in particular to the Netherlands. At the end of the war a great deal of houses was destroyed. Only a minority of citizens still lived in town. Yet even in the post-war period Burgsteinfurt remained lively. In 1660, Prince-Bishop Bernhard von Galen of Münster occupied the town and even ignored judicial orders by the Reichskammergericht, the highest court of the Holy Roman Empire at that time. He even enforced the right of Catholics to perform the mass in the Great Church. The occupation stopped in 1716 because an agreement was reached. Shortly after that a Catholic baroque church was built in Burgsteinfurt. Furthermore, the county of Steinfurt proved to be liberal towards Jews. In 1662 the Count of Steinfurt licensed one of them to live and work in Steinfurt in accordance with his religion. Even though the citizens originally objected to the settlement of Jews, the Jewish community grew successively.

A more peaceful period of time began. Moats and walls were flattened and the resulting new land was given to the citizens for cultivation. Count Charles Paul Ernest planned increasing the economic power of the city. Inspired by several journeys to foreign countries he decided to build an amusement park east of the castle – the &quot;Bagno&quot; (Italian: il bagno = bath, spa) – based on French blueprints.

His heir Louis William Geldricus Ernest of Bentheim and Steinfurt expanded the originally little lake and reconstructed the garden in English style. In the time to follow many exotic buildings were put up, among these a so-called Chinese palace, an Arion ship, a Gothic house and the artificial ruin of a castle. Today there are only the concert hall, the island with the ruin and the New Guardhouse (&quot;Neue Wache&quot;) left, but the &quot;Bagno&quot; has become established as an attraction for tourists.

At the same time the conflict between Count and city came to a climax. Following a legal dispute the Count of Steinfurt deposed the city council, arrested the mayor and deployed 150 French soldiers. He banned the town guards and, consequently, the town guard festivals called &quot;Schützenfest.&quot; Later peace was restored through a settlement and a new council was elected. In 1806 the French allocated Steinfurt to the grand duchy &quot;Berg.&quot; Steinfurt was now the head of the &quot;arrondissement&quot; and therefore its administrational centre. Thus, a decision had been made which is still valid today. Steinfurt is still the seat of the local government, the local district court and the financial authorities. The French also closed the &quot;Kommende.&quot;

The decision of the French to choose Burgsteinfurt as an administrational centre was simultaneously the start of the industrial era. Due to poor harvests and subsequent common impoverishment many citizens left for the United States. Especially in Ohio and Missouri old &quot;Stemmerter&quot; (= citizens of Steinfurt) left their traces at that time. Meanwhile, Steinfurt was linked to the existing road networks. Old city gates were torn down to establish new housing estates beyond the old city boundaries. In 1851 the first house was built outside the ancient urban area. Railroad connections were established from Steinfurt to Münster, Enschede, Rheine, Oberhausen and Borken. Textile industry, tobacco factories and the brewery &quot;Rolinck&quot; gained recognition. The predominantly Protestant population grew significantly. An almost forgotten fact is that a first line of telegraphs existed between Burgsteinfurt and Borghorst. Christoph Ludwig von Hoffmann, MD, scientist and personal physician of the Count, installed the optical telegraph.

At the end of World War II, the town was in the British Zone of Occupation. The townsfolk were noted in the British press for their silent but palpable resentment of the British occupation. On 29 May 1945 the people of the town were ordered to watch an Allied documentary film detailing Nazi mass murder.

==Historical monuments==
The Old Town Hall built in 1561 indicates by its Renaissance gable the self-confidence of the economically successful citizens of Burgsteinfurt. The swinging contours of the gable lead to seven peaked pyramids and the crest of the city. The turret of the town hall is supported by one big beam, called &quot;Kaiserstiel&quot; (i.e., emperor&#x27;s beam). The Gothic hall below on the first floor contained the city guard and the prison for a very long time. On the second floor there is the big assembly hall of the city council and the chamber with the fireplace.

At the beginning of the Hahnen street is the &quot;Huck-Beifang-Haus.&quot; Eberhard Huck, the Count&#x27;s financial administrator, had built this house as an annex to his wife&#x27;s home in &quot;Bütkamp 3.&quot; The proud owner noted on the bay in Latin: &quot;Sunt hae structae aedes Eberhardie sumptibus Hucki. Ex his as superas sperat abire domos,&quot; which would be in English something like: &quot;This house was built at the expense of Eberhard Huck. From here he hopes he will come into heaven one day.&quot; The bay is marked with the crest of the Huck family (Huck = hook) and Beifang family and the year 1607. The building, which in the meantime harboured the public library, serves now occasionally as an art gallery and a function hall for public lectures.

From here a narrow medieval lane, the &quot;Kalkarstiege,&quot; leads to &quot;Bütkamp.&quot; There are several classic buildings all at once: first the Haus Bütkamp 3 on the left side and the house called Ackerbürgerhaus, a building inhabited by a citizen who was a farmer as well as a citizen of the town and who had his land outside the city walls. On the right side is a very graceful half-timbered house with two storeys located. It dates from the beginning of the 17th century and is called Kornschreiberhaus (&quot;Bütkamp 14&quot;). The second floor and the third floor extend into the street. Thus the house offered more space. Michael Oeglein from Southern Germany&#x27;s Swabia is considered the architect and initial owner of this house. He was in charge of collecting the duties and taxes the farmers owed to the Count. They delivered food grain (&quot;Korn&quot;) and he had to keep records. Since &quot;keeping records&quot; is in colloquial German &quot;(auf-)schreiben&quot;, his house was eventually known as &quot;Kornschreiberhaus.&quot;

The tall building housing the &quot;Stadtbücherei&quot; (municipal public library) is known as &quot;Weinhaus&quot; (wine-house). It is the oldest building at the market square. Built around 1450 by the Count, it served as accommodation for his guests and later on for selling wine. Moreover, it demonstrated how the Count held sway over the town and its market square which symbolized the wealth and power of the citizens. Due to certain defects concerning the building&#x27;s construction the roof had to be restored in 1490 already. The wall close to &quot;Kirchstrasse&quot; had to be rebuilt after the Thirty Years&#x27; War. And the stucco façade, a mix of Baroque elements and Art Nouveau dates back to 1912. Nowadays the house lodges a fireplace which was relocated from house &quot;Markt 16.&quot; It shows Adam and Eve while Eve passes on the apple to Adam.

Close to the Wine-House there are two houses in Renaissance style. The house &quot;Markt 18&quot; was owned by the judge and law professor at the &quot;Hohe Schule,&quot; Johannes Goddaeus, who had the house built on the foundations of a wine-shop. The house &quot;Markt 16&quot; was constructed by the Count&#x27;s administrator Dr. Caspar Kestering and his wife Adelheid Huberts immediately after the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648. Their initials are eligible in the crest of the two lions in front of the door. In the past there was a tavern, the cellar of which still exists. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the house was destroyed, but Kestering had a new house put up on the foundation of the old one in the style of the Dutch Renaissance.

Opposite to this house there is the House Pieter van der Swaagh, which was built in 1784 by judge Friedrich Houth in classicistic style. The flowerpots on the house with the artificial agaves probably derive from the Bagno.

The tour leads on to &quot;Burgstrasse.&quot; The Count&#x27;s the former &quot;Kunsthaus&quot; (House of Arts) deserves attention because more than a hundred years ago it was a unique museum of artwork, stuffed crocodiles and odd scientific instruments. At the end of &quot;Burgstrasse&quot; there is the &quot;Schlossmühle&quot; (castle mill) on the left and the castle itself on the right. There was a mill on this site already in the Middle Ages, today there is a café and a restaurant.

The Castle is one of Burgsteinfurt&#x27;s most important buildings. Registered sightseeing tours are offered, but only a limited area is open for tourists because the castle is still inhabited by the noble family. A fortified castle was erected on a hill already dug up in the 10th century, but was destroyed in 1164 in a conflict with Ascheberg&#x27;s nobility. The new facility contained an outer wall, the &quot;Buddenturm,&quot; a tall tower for defence demolished in the 18th century, and the tower used for living with the Great hall. A rare construction are the two chapels built on top of each other and used as two-storeyed chapel. The auxiliary building (&quot;Vorburg&quot;) of today in front of the main residence or &quot;Hauptburg&quot; comprises flats, garages, stables and farm buildings. In the middle there is a little Baroque &quot;house&quot; for a well, built by stonemason Johann Schrader.

From the castle and the market the former university building &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; can be seen. In order to oppose the activities of the Jesuits in Münster and &quot;Münsterland,&quot; Count Arnold IV (1554–1606) founded a Calvinistic university, once the oldest university in Westphalia. Starting in 1591 the &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; offered courses in law, theology, medicine/physics, philosophy, history and rhetoric. Doctors’ degrees, however, were not awarded in Burgsteinfurt. The &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; was built in the Renaissance style and is crowned by two weather vanes that are marked with the crest of Count Arnold IV and his wife. Around the big tower runs a gallery, where people could make astronomical computations. At the beginning of the 19th century the &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; was closed. It was used then by French troops under Napoleonic rule, later on as the seat of a law court and as a prison.

From the &quot;Hohe Schule&quot; an alley branches off, the so-called Kautenstege, actually Kortenstege or &quot;short way.&quot; At the beginning the old Geisthaus (House of the Holy Spirit) can be seen, the only surviving poorhouse of the city from the 15th century. In &quot;Kautenstege&quot; a memorial stone reminds the visitor of the Synagogue that once stood here and the Jewish citizens who were deported. The Synagogue was destroyed in November 1938. At the end of &quot;Kautenstege&quot; there is the Steinstrasse (&quot;cobblestone street,&quot; in former times the only paved street in Burgsteinfurt); on the right side there is the old town hall, the starting point of the tour.

==Education==
Steinfurt and all its 34,000 citizens (14,000 of them living in Burgsteinfurt) profits from its location in the centre of the charming landscape of &quot;Münsterland.&quot; Steinfurt is also the home of numerous medium-sized enterprises, especially the brewery, spinning mills and transportation companies. In Steinfurt there are a variety of schools and colleges, including of course the traditional academic high school &quot;Arnoldinum,&quot; a descendant of the &quot;Hohe Schule.&quot; The polytechnic institute of Münster keeps several world-famous departments in Burgsteinfurt, particularly for electronic technology and bio-chemistry. The city possesses two public pools, two secondary schools and in the &quot;Bagno&quot; there is one of the most beautiful golf courses in Westphalia (nine holes).

The engineering faculties of the University of Applied Sciences Münster (Fachhochschule Münster) are based in Steinfurt.

<doc id="181407" wikidata="Q889491" url="?curid=181407" title="Groundcover">
<text>Groundcover or ground cover is any plant that grows low over an area of ground, which protects the topsoil from erosion and drought. In a terrestrial ecosystem, the ground cover forms the layer of vegetation below the shrub layer known as the herbaceous layer, and provides habitats and concealments for (especially fossorial) terrestrial fauna. The most widespread ground covers are grasses of various types.

In ecology, groundcover is a difficult subject to address because it is known by several different names and is classified in several different ways. The term &quot;groundcover&quot; could also be referring to &quot;the herbaceous layer&quot;, &quot;regenerative layer&quot;, &quot;ground flora&quot; or even &quot;step over&quot;.

In agriculture, ground cover refers to anything that lies on top of the soil and protects it from erosion and inhibits weeds. It can be anything from a low layer of grasses to a plastic material. The term &quot;ground cover&quot; can also specifically refer to landscaping fabric, a breathable tarp that allows water and gas exchange.

In gardening jargon, however, the term &quot;groundcover&quot; refers to plants that are used in place of weeds and improves appearance by concealing bare earth.

== Contributions to the environment ==

The herbaceous layer is often overlooked in most ecological analyses because it is so common and contributes the smallest amount of the environment&#x27;s overall biomass. However, groundcover is crucial to the survival of many environments. The groundcover layer of a forest can contribute up to 90% of the ecosystem&#x27;s plant diversity. Additionally, the herbaceous layer ratio of biomass to contribution to plant productivity is disproportionate in many ecosystems. The herbaceous layer can constitute up to 4% of the overall net primary productivity (NPP) of an ecosystem, four times its average biomass.

===Reproduction===
Groundcover typically reproduces one of five ways:
* Lateral growth 
* Side growth: Branches on the side of the plant extend outwards upon contact with the soil.
* Base growth: New plants produced from the base of the origin plant.
* Under/Above-ground growth: Produced from rhizomes and stolons
* Roots
Like most foliage, groundcover reacts to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. These responses can be classified as legacy or active responses. Legacy responses occur during long-term changes to an environment, such as the conversion of a forest to agricultural land and back into forest. Active responses occur with sudden disturbances to the environment, such as tornadoes and forest fires.

Groundcover has also been known to influence the placement and growth of tree seedlings. All tree seedlings must first fall from their origin trees and then permeate the layer created by groundcover in order to reach the soil and germinate. The groundcover filters out a large amount of seeds, but lets a smaller portion of seeds pass through and grow. This filtration provides ample amount of space between the seeds for future growth. In some areas, the groundcover can become so dense that no seeds can permeate the surface, and the forest is instead converted to shrubbery. Groundcover also inhibits the amount of light which reaches the floor of an ecosystem. An experiment conducted with the &quot;rhododendron maximum&quot; canopy in the southern Appalachian region concluded that 4–8% of total sunlight makes it to the herbaceous layer, whereas only about 1–2% reaches the ground.

===Variation===
Two common variations of groundcover are residency and transient species. Residency species typically reach a maximum of in height, and are therefore permanently classified as herbaceous. Transient species are capable of growing past this height, and are therefore only temporarily considered herbaceous. These height differences make ideal environments for a variety of animals, such as the reed warbler, the harvest mouse and the wren.

Groundcover can also be classified in terms of its foliage. Groundcover that keeps its foliage for the entire year is known as evergreen, whereas groundcover that loses its foliage in the winter months is known as deciduous.

== In gardening ==
 
Five general types of plants are commonly used as groundcovers in gardening:
* Vines, which are woody plants with slender, spreading stems
* Herbaceous plants, or non-woody plants
* Shrubs of low-growing, spreading species
* Moss of larger, coarser species
* Ornamental grasses, especially low-growing varieties

Of these types, some of the most common groundcovers include:

* Alfalfa (&quot;Medicago sativa&quot;)
* Clover (&quot;Trifolium&quot;)
* Dichondra
* Bacopa (&quot;Bacopa&quot;)
* Carpobrotus
* Delairea
* Ivy (&quot;Hedera&quot;)
* Gazania (&quot;Gazania rigens&quot;)
* Ground-elder (&quot;Aegopodium podagraria&quot;)
* Ice plant
* Japanese honeysuckle (&quot;Lonicera japonica&quot;)
* Juniperus horizontalis
* Creeping lantana
* Lilyturf (&quot;Liriope muscari&quot; and &quot;Liriope spicata&quot;)
* Mint (&quot;Mentha&quot;)
* Mesembryanthemum cordifolium
* Nasturtium (&quot;Tropaeolum majus&quot;)
* Pachysandra
* Pearlwort (&quot;Sagina subulata&quot;)
* Sphagneticola trilobata
* Periwinkle (&quot;Vinca&quot;)
* Shasta daisy (&quot;Leucanthemum&quot;)
* Soleirolia (&quot;Soleirolia soleirolii&quot;)
* Spider plant (&quot;Chlorophytum comosum&quot;)

=== In roof gardens ===
Groundcover is a popular solution for difficult gardening issues because it is low maintenance, aesthetically pleasing and fast growing, minimizing the spread of weeds. For this reason, ground cover is also a common choice for roof gardens. Roofs take on the brunt of incoming weather, meaning any plants on a roof must be resistant to long-term exposure to sun, overwatering from rain and harsh winds. Groundcover plants are able to sustain themselves in such conditions while also providing lush vegetation to what would otherwise be unused space.

Ishikawa Prefecture borders Toyama Prefecture to the east, Gifu Prefecture to the southeast, and Fukui Prefecture to the south.

Kanazawa is the capital and largest city of Ishikawa Prefecture, with other major cities including Hakusan, Komatsu, and Kaga. Ishikawa is located on the Sea of Japan coast and features most of the Noto Peninsula which forms Toyama Bay, one of the largest bays in Japan. Ishikawa Prefecture is part of the historic Hokuriku region and formerly an important populated center that contained some of the wealthiest &quot;han&quot; (domains) of the Japanese feudal era. Ishikawa Prefecture is home to Kanazawa Castle, Kenroku-en one of the Three Great Gardens of Japan, Nyotaimori (&quot;body sushi&quot;), and Kutani ware.

== History ==
Ishikawa was formed in 1872 from the merger of Kaga Province and the smaller Noto Province, with the seat of the government being located in Mikawa. The political center of Ishikawa was moved to Kanazawa in 1873.

=== The Kioizaka Incident ===
The newly formed Ishikawa Prefecture came to be regarded with caution by the national government following the in 1878, in which 6 , dissatisfied by the Meiji government&#x27;s &quot;maladministration, suppression of civil rights, and misuse of government property&quot;, assassinated Japanese statesman Ōkubo Toshimichi. Concerned about the possibility of a Hokuriku bloc forming in support of the Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement, and thus wanting to weaken the influence of the former Kaga lords, the national government made the decision to divide the prefecture. This took place in two stages, beginning in 1881, when Fukui Prefecture was formed, and ending in 1883 with the formation of Toyama Prefecture.

=== 2024 earthquake ===
On the 1 January 2024, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck Ishikawa Prefecture, specifically the Noto Peninsula. In Ishikawa, a total of 508 people were killed and 2 people are currently reported missing as a result of the earthquake. Overall it is estimated that 1,200 people were injured across different prefectures.

In September 2024, severe rainfall in the prefecture led to deadly floods and landslides, causing at least six deaths and widespread damage. Thousands were evacuated as rivers overflowed, while recovery from a prior earthquake complicated relief efforts. Emergency warnings remain in place.

<text>Rheine () is a city in the district of Steinfurt in Westphalia, Germany. It is the largest city in the district and the location of Rheine Air Base.

==Geography==

Rheine is on the river Ems, about north of Münster, west of Osnabrück and east of Hengelo (Netherlands).

==History==
===Early history===
Although the region around the city has been populated since prehistoric times, Rheine was first mentioned in a document signed by Louis the Pious in 838. On 15 August 1327, it received its town charter from Louis II, Bishop of Münster.

The settlement was near to the crossing of two old merchant roads and a ford over the river Ems. Frankish soldiers initially secured this strategic point with a barrack yard. Later a church and more buildings were added to this outpost.

===17th-19th centuries===
At the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the city was burned down almost completely. Swedish and Hessian troops besieged imperial soldiers who had entrenched themselves in Rheine. On 20/21 September and 19 October 1647 glowing cannonballs set fire to the city and 365 houses were destroyed. In 1803 the city became the capital of the Sovereign Principality of Rheina-Wolbeck (556 square kilometers) of the House of Looz-Corswarem, later annexed by the Grand Duchy of Berg and the Kingdom of Prussia.

During the Industrial Revolution the textile industry prospered. It remained an important economic factor until the second half of the 20th century. Today engineering industries and services form the largest part of economy in Rheine.

===20th and 21st centuries===
On 1 April 1927 about 10,000 inhabitants of the Office Rheine (Bentlage, Wadelheim, Dutum, etc.) were incorporated into the city, the population increased to 29,598, the city area was thus tripled.

During Nazi rule of Germany, Jewish citizens were deported from Rheine, as elsewhere in Germany. In the Second World War, Allied forces bombarded the city repeatedly, especially the railway line and the Dortmund-Ems Canal, which represented tactical goals. Large-scale bombing raids occurred on 5 October 1944 and 21 March 1945, each leaving more than 200 dead and causing extensive damage to the city area. The conquest of Rheine took place on 2 April 1945 after some fierce fighting by units of the 157th British Infantry Brigade (5th Battalion of the King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers Regiment, 7th Battalion of the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) Regiment).

After 1945, Rheine was in the British occupation zone and 1946 was politically assigned to the newly founded &quot;Land&quot; (state) of North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1949 it joined with the other states in the Western Zone to form the Federal Republic of Germany.

On 10 February 1946 Rheine was affected by the highest ever Emshochwasser. Large parts of the city were flooded.

On 15 August 2002 the city celebrated the 675th anniversary of the granting of municipal law.

<text>Moss Fotballklubb is a Norwegian football club, founded on 28 August 1906. They play in the 1. divisjon, the second highest division in the Norwegian football league system. They played in the Norwegian top flight between 1937–1939, 1953–54, 1977–1985 (9 seasons), 1987–1990 (4 seasons), 1996 and 1998–2002. The club came close to earning promotion to the top flight in 2005, but lost the play-off against Molde.

==Stadium==
Moss play their home games at Melløs stadion, which has a capacity of around 10,000. Because of national rules of professional license for top clubs in Norway, the stadium has only been certified for 3200 spectators. Built in 1939, it has remained the club&#x27;s home ground ever since. The record attendance is 10,085, set in 2003 against rivals Fredrikstad. A higher attendance may have been achieved in 1976 in a match against Odd, but no precise figure exists for this match because the gates broke down after around 9500 spectators had shown up.

<text>The jian ( , , , ) is a double-edged straight sword used during the last 2,500 years in China. The first Chinese sources that mention the &quot;jian&quot; date to the 7th century BCE, during the Spring and Autumn period, one of the earliest specimens being the Sword of Goujian. Historical one-handed versions have blades varying from in length. The weight of an average sword of blade-length would be approximately 700 to 900 grams (1.5 to 2 pounds). There are also larger two-handed versions used for training by many styles of Chinese martial arts.

Professional &quot;jian&quot; practitioners are referred to as jianke ( or &quot;swordsmen&quot;; a term dating from the Han dynasty).

In Chinese folklore, the &quot;jian&quot; is known as &quot;The Gentleman of Weapons&quot; and is considered one of the four major weapons, along with the &quot;gun&quot; (staff), &quot;qiang&quot; (spear), and the &quot;dao&quot; (sabre). These swords are also sometimes referred to as &quot;taijijian&quot; or &quot;tai chi swords&quot;, reflecting their current use as training weapons for tai chi practitioners, though there were no historical jian types created specifically for tai chi.

==Parts of the &quot;jian&quot;==

A guard or hilt protects the hand from an opposing blade. Guard shapes varied, but often had short wings or lobes pointing either forward or backward, the latter sometimes having an &quot;ace of spades&quot; appearance. Early &quot;jian&quot; often had very small, simple guards. From the Song and Ming periods onward, guards could feature zoomorphic shapes, or have crossbars and quillons. A minority of &quot;jian&quot; featured the disc-shaped guards associated with &quot;dao&quot;.

The jian&#x27;s hilt can accommodate the grip of both hands or one hand plus two or three fingers of the other hand. Two-handed &quot;jiàn&quot; of up to in length, known as &quot;shuangshou jian&quot;, existed but were not as common as the one-handed version. The longer two-handed handle could be used as a lever to lock an opponent&#x27;s arm if necessary. Grips are usually of fluted wood or covered in rayskin, with a minority being wrapped with cord.

The end of the handle was finished with a pommel for balance, to prevent the handle from sliding through the hand should the hand&#x27;s grip be loosened, and for striking or trapping the opponent as opportunity required—such as in &quot;withdrawing&quot; techniques. The pommel was historically peened onto the tang of the blade, thereby holding together as one solid unit the blade, guard, handle, and pommel. Most &quot;jian&quot; of the last century or so are assembled with a threaded tang onto which the pommel or pommel-nut is screwed.

Sometimes a tassel is attached to the hilt. During the Ming Dynasty these were usually passed through an openwork pommel, and in the Qing through a hole in the grip itself; modern swords usually attach the tassel to the end of the pommel. Historically these were likely used as lanyards, allowing the wielder to retain the sword in combat. There are some sword forms which utilize the tassel as an integral part of their swordsmanship style (sometimes offensively), while other schools dispense with sword tassels entirely. The movement of the tassel may have served to distract opponents, and some schools further claim that metal wires or thin silk cords were once worked into the tassels for impairing vision and causing bleeding when swept across the face. The tassel&#x27;s use now is primarily decorative.

The blade itself is customarily divided into three sections for leverage in different offensive and defensive techniques. The tip of the blade is the &quot;jiànfeng&quot;, meant for stabbing, slashing, and quick percussive cuts. The &quot;jiànfeng&quot; typically curves smoothly to a point, though in the Ming period sharply angled points were common. Some antiques have rounded points, though these are likely the result of wear. The middle section is the &quot;zhongren&quot; or middle edge, and is used for a variety of offensive and defensive actions: cleaving cuts, draw cuts, and deflections. The section of blade closest to the guard is called the &quot;jiàngen&quot; or root, and is mainly used for defensive actions; on some late period jian, the base of the blade was made into a ricasso. These sections are not necessarily of the same length, with the &quot;jiànfeng&quot; being only three or four inches long.

Jian blades generally feature subtle profile taper (decreasing width), but often have considerable distal taper (decreasing thickness), with blade thickness near the tip being only half the thickness of the root&#x27;s base. Jiàn may also feature differential sharpening, where the blade is made progressively sharper towards the tip, usually corresponding to the three sections of the blade. The cross-section of the blade is typically lenticular (eye-shaped) or a flattened diamond, with a visible central ridge; ancient bronze jian sometimes have a hexagonal cross-section.

==Materials==

Jian were originally made from bronze, then steel as metal technology advanced. There are some, perhaps ceremonial, jian which are carved from a single solid piece of jade.

Traditional jian blades are usually of &quot;sanmei&quot; (three plate) construction, which involved sandwiching a core of hard steel between two plates of softer steel. The central plate protrudes slightly from its surrounding pieces, allowing for a sharp edge, while the softer spine protects the brittle core. Some blades had &quot;wumei&quot; or five plate construction, with two more soft plates being used at the central ridge. Bronze jian were often made in a somewhat similar manner: in this case an alloy with a high copper content would be used to make a resilient core and spine, while the edge would be made from a high-tin-content alloy for sharpness and welded onto the rest of the blade.

The sword smiths of China are often credited with the forging technologies that traveled to Vietnam, Japan and Korea to allow sword smiths there to create such weapons as the katana. These technologies include folding, inserted alloys, and differential hardening of the edge. While the Japanese would be more influenced by the Chinese dāo (single-edged swords of various forms), the early Japanese swords known as &quot;ken&quot; are often based on jian. The Korean version of the jian is known as the &quot;geom&quot; or &quot;gum&quot;, and these swords often preserve features found in Ming-era jian, such as openwork pommels and sharply angled tips.

In martial art schools wooden swords are used for training, so most martial arts students&#x27; first experience with a jian in modern times is with one of those weapons. Before schools were a formal way of passing on sword knowledge, students may have begun with a simple wooden stick when training with their teacher. In some religious Taoist sects, those wooden practice swords have come to have an esoteric ritual purpose. Some claim that these wooden swords metaphorically represent the discipline of an accomplished student.

Contemporary jian are often forged (shaped with heat and hammer) and assembled by mostly traditional methods for training of practitioners of Chinese martial arts around the world. These jian vary greatly in quality and historical accuracy.

Contemporary jian are also sometimes forgeries (artificially aged and misrepresented as antiques) for sale to tourists and collectors who cannot distinguish them from true antiques.

==Historical use==

Originally similar to bronze double-edged daggers in varying lengths, jian reached modern lengths by roughly 500 BC. Though there is significant variation in length, balance, and weight of the jian from different periods, within any given period the general purpose of the jian is to be a multipurpose cut and thrust weapon capable of stabbing as well as making both precise cuts and slashes, as opposed to specializing in one form of use. Although the many forms and schools of swordsmanship with the jian vary, the general purpose and use is still not lost.

During the Qin and Han dynasties, the first two dynasties which united China, jian from the by then defunct Chu dynasty were very highly regarded. Chu became particularly famous for its swords after conquering the state of Yue, who had previously been famous for their swords, and who credited their sword techniques to a southern woman of unknown ancestry referred to as Yuenü.

Among the Terracotta warriors in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, figures representing officers were originally armed with jian made from an alloy of copper, tin, and other elements including nickel, magnesium, and cobalt. Several double-edged bronze swords have been recovered by modern archaeologists, but most were stolen centuries ago along with the polearms and bows of the enlisted men.

Historical &quot;jian&quot; wielders would engage in test cutting called &quot;shizhan&quot;, practicing their skills on targets known as &quot;caoren&quot;, or &quot;grass men&quot;. Such targets were made from bamboo, rice straw, or saplings. Though similar to the Japanese art of tameshigiri, &quot;shizhan&quot; was never formalized to the extent that the latter art was.

Today many Chinese martial arts such as tai chi and their martial artists still train extensively with &quot;jian&quot;, and expertise in its techniques is said by many of them to be the highest physical expression of their kung fu. Famous &quot;jian&quot; forms include &quot;Sancai Jian&quot; (), &quot;Kunwu Jian&quot; (), &quot;Wudang Xuanmen Jian&quot; (), and &quot;taijijian&quot; (). Most &quot;jian&quot; today are flexible tai chi or wushu &quot;jian&quot; used mainly for ceremonial or performance purposes and not for actual combat. These swords have extremely thin blades or a high degree of flexibility compared to historical battlefield quality &quot;jian&quot;, properties intended to add auditory and visual appeal to a wushu performance. These same properties render them unsuitable for historically accurate combat.

==Military use==
Since 2008, officers in the Chinese navy are issued with ceremonial swords resembling the traditional &quot;jian&quot;. Each sword has the owner&#x27;s name engraved on the blade after graduation from the military academy.

== &quot;Taijijian&quot; and sword drill ==
At present, the &quot;taijijian&quot; forms are normally practiced for exercise like tai chi. The trainings are less on the physical form of the weapon and more on gaining greater balance and coordination through performing the slow movements. Therefore, the tai chi swords for everyday exercises are normally different from the swords mentioned above. Generally speaking, they are not dangerous, round edged without sharp blades, and retractable for convenience.

== Mythology and legacy ==

There are several Taoist immortals who are associated with the &quot;jian&quot;. One example is Lü Dongbin. The bodhisattva Mañjuśrī (Ch: &quot;Wénshū&quot;) is often depicted holding a &quot;jian&quot;, which is then referred to as the &quot;sword of wisdom&quot;.

&quot;Jian&quot; frequently appear in wuxia fiction and films. The swords or the techniques used to wield them may be effectively or explicitly supernatural, and the quest for such swords or techniques may be a major plot element.

<doc id="181415" wikidata="Q411240" url="?curid=181415" title="Mifepristone">
<text>Mifepristone, and also known by its developmental code name RU-486, is a drug typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about a medical abortion during pregnancy. This combination is 97% effective during the first 63 days (9 weeks) of pregnancy, yet effective in the second trimester as well. It is also used on its own to treat Cushing&#x27;s Syndrome or for use as a low-dose emergency contraceptive.
The most common adverse effects include abdominal pain, feeling tired, and vaginal bleeding. Serious side effects may include heavy vaginal bleeding, bacterial infection, and, if pregnant, birth defects. When used, appropriate follow-up care needs to be available. Mifepristone is primarily an antiprogestogen. It works by blocking the effects of progesterone, making both the cervix and uterine vessels dilate and causing uterine contraction. Mifepristone also works, to a less extent, as an antiglucocorticoid and diminishes the effects of hypercortisolism.
Mifepristone was developed in 1980 and came into use in France in 1987. It became available in the United States in 2000, for medication abortion, and in 2010, for Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Mifepristone was approved in Canada in January 2017.

==Medical uses==

===Abortion===
Mifepristone followed by a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) is used for medical abortion. Medical organizations have found this combination to be safe and effective. Guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists describe medication abortion using mifepristone and misoprostol as effective and appropriate at any gestational age. The World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend mifepristone followed by misoprostol for first- and second-trimester medical abortion. Mifepristone alone is less effective, resulting in abortion within 1–2 weeks in anywhere from 54% to 92% of pregnancies, according to review of 13 studies.

===Cushing&#x27;s syndrome===
Mifepristone is used for the medical treatment of high blood sugar caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in adults with endogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome who also have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or cannot have surgery. In a Phase III trial, it improved glycemic control, increased insulin sensitivity, and reduced body weight regardless of the cause of CS.

=== Medical management of early pregnancy loss ===
Mifepristone combined with misoprostol is the preferred medication regimen for management of early pregnancy loss. While misoprostol alone can be used, the addition of a dose of mifepristone twenty-four hours before misoprostol administration improves treatment efficacy.

=== Other uses ===
Mifepristone at low doses has been used for emergency contraception. Mifepristone has also been used to treat symptomatic leiomyoma (uterine fibroids) and endometriosis. As elevated cortisol levels have been implicated in psychotic depression, mifepristone has been used as a treatment.

==Side effects==
Serious complications with mifepristone are rare with about 0.04%–0.09% requiring hospitalization and 0.05% requiring blood transfusion.

Nearly all women using the mifepristone/misoprostol regimen experienced abdominal pain, uterine cramping, and vaginal bleeding or spotting for an average of 9–16 days. For most women, the most severe cramps after use of misoprostol last for less than 6 hours and can generally be managed with ibuprofen. Up to 8% of women experienced some type of bleeding for 30 days or more. Other less common side effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, fatigue, and fever. Pelvic inflammatory disease is a very rare but serious complication. Excessive bleeding and incomplete termination of a pregnancy require further intervention by a doctor (such as a repeat dose of misoprostol or a vacuum aspiration). Mifepristone is contraindicated in the presence of adrenal failure, long-term oral corticosteroid therapy (although inhaled and topical steroids are not contraindications), hemorrhagic disorders, inherited porphyria, and hemophilia or anticoagulant use. Women with an intrauterine device in their uterus should remove the IUD prior to medication abortion to avoid unnecessary cramping. Mifepristone is not effective in treating ectopic pregnancy.

A postmarketing summary found, of about 1.52 million women who had received mifepristone until April 2011 in the United States, 14 were reported to have died after application. Eight of these cases were associated with sepsis; the other six had various causes such as drug abuse and suspected murder. Other incidents reported to the FDA included 612 nonlethal hospitalizations, 339 blood transfusions, 48 severe infections, and 2,207 (0.15%) adverse events altogether.

No long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mifepristone have been performed. This is in accord with ICH guidelines, which do not require carcinogenicity testing in nongenotoxic drugs intended for administration for less than six months.

===Pregnancy===
Mifepristone alone results in abortion within 1–2 weeks in 54% to 92% of pregnancies. The effectiveness increases to greater than 90% if misoprostol is given after the mifepristone. There is no evidence that the effects of mifepristone can be reversed, although some anti-abortion groups claim that it can be reversed by giving progesterone. Researchers in the United States initiated a trial of the so-called &quot;reversal&quot; regimen in 2019, but stopped prematurely due to serious safety concerns about using mifepristone without follow-up misoprostol. Giving progesterone has not been shown to halt medication abortion, and not completing the combination regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol may cause serious bleeding.

In those who continue pregnancy after use of mifepristone together with misoprostol for termination, birth defects may occur. Exposure to a single large dose of mifepristone in newborn rats was not associated with any reproductive problems, although chronic low-dose exposure of newborn rats to mifepristone was associated with structural and functional reproductive abnormalities. Studies in mice, rats, and rabbits revealed developmental abnormalities for rabbits, but not rats or mice.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Mifepristone is a steroidal antiprogestogen (IC50 = 0.025 nM for the PR), as well as an antiglucocorticoid (IC50 = 2.2 nM for the GR) and antiandrogen (IC50 = 10 nM for the AR) to a much lesser extent. It antagonizes cortisol action competitively at the receptor level.

In the presence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a competitive progesterone receptor antagonist (in the absence of progesterone, mifepristone acts as a partial agonist). Mifepristone is a 19-nor steroid with a bulky &quot;p&quot;-(dimethylamino) phenyl substituent above the plane of the molecule at the 11β-position responsible for inducing or stabilizing an inactive receptor conformation and a hydrophobic 1-propynyl substituent below the plane of the molecule at the 17α-position that increases its progesterone receptor binding affinity.

In addition to being an antiprogestogen, mifepristone is also an antiglucocorticoid and a weak antiandrogen. Mifepristone&#x27;s relative binding affinity at the progesterone receptor is more than twice that of progesterone, its relative binding affinity at the glucocorticoid receptor is more than three times that of dexamethasone and more than ten times that of cortisol. Its relative binding affinity at the androgen receptor is less than one-third that of testosterone, and it does not bind to the estrogen receptor or the mineralocorticoid receptor.

Mifepristone as a regular contraceptive at 2 mg daily prevents ovulation (1 mg daily does not). A single preovulatory 10-mg dose of mifepristone delays ovulation by three to four days and is as effective an emergency contraceptive as a single 1.5-mg dose of the progestin levonorgestrel.

In women, mifepristone at doses greater or equal to 1 mg/kg antagonizes the endometrial and myometrial effects of progesterone. In humans, an antiglucocorticoid effect of mifepristone is manifested at doses greater or equal to 4.5 mg/kg by a compensatory increase in ACTH and cortisol. In animals, a weak antiandrogenic effect is seen with prolonged administration of very high doses of 10 to 100 mg/kg.

In medication abortion regimens, mifepristone blockade of progesterone receptors directly causes endometrial decidual degeneration, cervical softening and dilatation, release of endogenous prostaglandins, and an increase in the sensitivity of the myometrium to the contractile effects of prostaglandins. Mifepristone-induced decidual breakdown indirectly leads to trophoblast detachment, resulting in decreased syncytiotrophoblast production of hCG, which in turn causes decreased production of progesterone by the corpus luteum (pregnancy is dependent on progesterone production by the corpus luteum through the first nine weeks of gestation—until placental progesterone production has increased enough to take the place of corpus luteum progesterone production). When followed sequentially by a prostaglandin, mifepristone 200 mg is (100 mg may be, but 50 mg is not) as effective as 600 mg in producing a medical abortion.

&#x27;Contragestion&#x27; is a term promoted by Étienne-Émile Baulieu in the context of his advocacy of mifepristone, defining it as inclusive of some hypothesized mechanisms of action of some contraceptives and those of mifepristone to induce abortion. Baulieu&#x27;s definition of a &#x27;contragestive&#x27; included any birth control method that could possibly act after fertilization and before nine-weeks gestational age.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The elimination half-life is complex; according to the label: &quot;After a distribution phase, elimination is at first slow, the concentration decreasing by a half between about 12 and 72 hours, and then more rapid, giving an elimination half-life of 18 hours. With radio receptor assay techniques, the terminal half-life is of up to 90 hours, including all metabolites of mifepristone able to bind to progesterone receptors.&quot; Metapristone is the major metabolite of mifepristone.

==Chemistry==
Mifepristone, also known as 11β-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-17α-(1-propynyl)estra-4,9-dien-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of steroid hormones like progesterone, cortisol, and testosterone. It has substitutions at the C11β and C17α positions and double bonds at the C4(5) and C9(10) positions.

==History==
===1980–1987===
In April 1980, as part of a formal research project at the French pharmaceutical company Roussel-Uclaf for the development of glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, endocrinologist Étienne-Émile Baulieu and chemist Georges Teutsch synthesized mifepristone (RU-38486, the 38,486th compound synthesized by Roussel-Uclaf from 1949 to 1980; shortened to RU-486), which was discovered to also be a progesterone receptor antagonist. In October 1981, Étienne-Émile Baulieu, a consultant to Roussel-Uclaf, arranged tests of its use for medical abortion in 11 women in Switzerland by gynecologist Walter Herrmann at the University of Geneva&#x27;s Cantonal Hospital, with successful results announced on 19 April 1982. On 9 October 1987, following worldwide clinical trials in 20,000 women of mifepristone with a prostaglandin analogue (initially sulprostone or gemeprost, later misoprostol) for medical abortion, Roussel-Uclaf sought approval in France for their use for medical abortion, with approval announced on 23 September 1988.

===1988–1990===
On 21 October 1988, in response to antiabortion protests and concerns of majority (54.5%) owner Hoechst AG of Germany, Roussel-Uclaf&#x27;s executives and board of directors voted 16 to 4 to stop distribution of mifepristone, which they announced on 26 October 1988. Two days later, the French government ordered Roussel-Uclaf to distribute mifepristone in the interests of public health. French Health Minister Claude Évin explained: &quot;I could not permit the abortion debate to deprive women of a product that represents medical progress. From the moment Government approval for the drug was granted, RU-486 became the moral property of women, not just the property of a drug company.&quot; Following use by 34,000 women in France from April 1988 to February 1990 of mifepristone distributed free of charge, Roussel-Uclaf began selling Mifegyne (mifepristone) to hospitals in France in February 1990 at a price (negotiated with the French government) of per 600-mg dose.

===1991–1996===
Mifegyne was subsequently approved in Great Britain in July 1991, and in Sweden in September 1992, but until his retirement in April 1994, Hoechst AG chairman Wolfgang Hilger, a devout Roman Catholic, blocked any further expansion in availability. Soon after becoming U.S. President in 1993, Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. Health and Human Services Department to investigate mifepristone&#x27;s potential as an abortion medication, and also pressured Hoeschst to make the RU-486 medication available in the United States. On 16 May 1994, Roussel-Uclaf announced it was donating without remuneration all rights for medical uses of mifepristone in the United States to the Population Council, which would then sponsor clinical trials for mifepristone between September 1994 and September 1995. In September 1995, The Population Council licensed mifpristone to Danco Laboratories, which was a new, single-product company that was intended to be resistant to antiabortion boycotts. Danco entered into a manufacturing agreement with Hungarian drug manufacturer Gedeon Richter. In 1996, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conditionally licensed RU-486 for early trimester abortion, pending a resolution on some remaining technical and manufacturing issues.

===1997–1999===
On 8 April 1997, after buying the remaining 43.5% of Roussel-Uclaf stock in early 1997, Hoechst AG ( billion annual revenue) announced the end of its manufacture and sale of Mifegyne ( million annual revenue) and the transfer of all rights for medical uses of mifepristone outside of the United States to Exelgyn, a new single-product company immune to antiabortion boycotts, whose CEO was former Roussel-Uclaf CEO Édouard Sakiz. In 1997, Gideon Richter would withdraw from efforts to manufacture mifepristone in the United States following opposition from pro-life groups, which led to Danco filing a breach of contract lawsuit. In 1999, Exelgyn won approval of Mifegyne in 11 additional countries, and in 28 more countries over the following decade.

===2000–present===
In September 2000 Danco Laboratories, a sub-licencee of the Population Council, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell mifepristone under the brand name Mifeprex.

In 2019, the first generic form of mifepristone in the United States became available, manufactured by GenBioPro.

==Society and culture==
Mifepristone is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Since 2005, it has been included on the core list, with misoprostol, with a special note &quot;where permitted under national law and where culturally acceptable&quot;.

=== Economics ===
Cost and availability limit access in many parts of the world.

===Frequency of use===

====United States====
Medication abortions voluntarily reported by 33 US states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have increased as a percentage of total abortions every year since the approval of mifepristone: 1.0% in 2000, 2.9% in 2001, 5.2% in 2002, 7.9% in 2003, 9.3% in 2004, 9.9% in 2005, 10.6% in 2006, and 13.1% in 2007 (20.3% of those at less than 9 weeks gestation).

A Guttmacher Institute survey of abortion providers estimated that medication abortions accounted for 17% of all abortions and slightly over 25% of abortions before 9 weeks gestation in the United States in 2008 (94% of nonhospital medication abortions used mifepristone and misoprostol, 6% used methotrexate and misoprostol). Medication abortions accounted for 32% of first trimester abortions at Planned Parenthood clinics in the United States in 2008. Considering abortions performed in non-hospital facilities, medication abortions accounted for 24% in 2011 and 31% in 2014. In 2014, facilities that provided a relatively small number of abortions (fewer than 400 procedures per year) were more likely to perform them with medication. Medication abortions accounted for 39% of all US abortions in 2017, and 54% in 2020.

====Europe====
In France, the percentage of medication abortions of all abortions continues to increase: 38% in 2003, 42% in 2004, 44% in 2005, 46% in 2006, 49% in 2007 (vs. 18% in 1996). In England and Wales, 52% of early abortions (less than 9 weeks gestation) in 2009 were medication-based; the percentage of all abortions that are medication-based has increased every year for the past 14 years (from 5% in 1995 to 40% in 2009) and has more than doubled in the last five years. In Scotland, 81.2% of early abortions in 2009 were medication-based (up from 55.8% in 1992 when medication abortion was introduced); the percentage of all abortions that are medication-based has increased every year for the past 17 years (from 16.4% in 1992 to 69.9% in 2009). In Sweden, 85.6% of early abortions and 73.2% of abortions before the end of the 12th week of gestation in 2009 were medication-based; 68.2% of all abortions in 2009 were medication-based. In Great Britain and Sweden, mifepristone is licensed for use with vaginal gemeprost or oral misoprostol. As of 2000, more than 620,000 women in Europe had had medication abortions using a mifepristone regimen. In Denmark, mifepristone was used in between 3,000 and 4,000 of just over 15,000 abortions in 2005.

===Legal status===

====In the United States====
Mifepristone was approved for abortion in the United States by the FDA in September 2000. , it was legal and available in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico. It is a prescription drug, but was not initially available to the public through pharmacies; its distribution is primarily restricted to specially qualified licensed physicians, sold by Danco Laboratories under the brand name Mifeprex. As of September 2021, in 32 states, the drug could only be provided by a licensed physician, and in 19 states, the prescribing clinician was required to be physically in the room with the patient while they are taking the drug.

Roussel Uclaf did not seek US approval, so in the United States legal availability was not initially possible. The United States banned importation of mifepristone for personal use in 1989, a decision supported by Roussel Uclaf. In 1994, Roussel Uclaf gave the U.S. drug rights to the Population Council in exchange for immunity from any product liability claims. The Population Council sponsored clinical trials in the United States. The drug went on approvable status from 1996. Production was intended to begin through the Danco Group in 1996, but they withdrew briefly in 1997 due to a corrupt business partner, delaying availability again.

In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved mifepristone, to end a pregnancy through 70 days gestation (70 days or less since the first day of a woman&#x27;s last menstrual period). The approved dosing regimen is 200 mg of mifepristone taken by mouth (swallowed).  24 to 48 hours after taking mifepristone, 800 mcg (micrograms) of misoprostol is taken buccally (in the cheek pouch), at a location appropriate for the patient.

Mifepristone tablets have a marketing authorization in the United States for the treatment of high blood sugar caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in adults with endogenous Cushing&#x27;s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or cannot have surgery.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, safe access to mifepristone was a concern, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists among other groups filed a lawsuit to relax the FDA&#x27;s rule as to allow mifepristone to be acquired from mail-order and retail pharmacies. While the Fourth Circuit had granted a preliminary injunction to allow this distribution, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a stay order in January 2021 to retain the FDA&#x27;s rule pending the results of the ongoing litigation.

On 16 December 2021, the FDA voluntarily adopted a new rule permanently relaxing the requirement that the pill be obtained in person, allowing it to be sent through the mail. A prescription is still required, so that a doctor can screen for risk factors that would make taking the pill unsafe for the mother. In January 2023, the FDA further relaxed rules, allowing any retail pharmacy to become certified to fill mifepristone prescriptions.

After regulations on abortion early in pregnancy were ruled constitutional by the 2022 decision &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, some states enacted restrictions on abortions and abortion pills. In January 2023, the United States Department of Justice issued an interpretation of the Comstock Act that it was legal for United States Postal Service employees to deliver the pills in any state, because they could not know whether the pills would be used for an abortion or other purposes.

In January 2023, GenBioPro filed suit to overturn state laws that prohibit sale of mifepristone, claiming that such laws are invalid because it is a federally approved drug.

The argument that state laws seeking to ban or restrict the use of mifepristone are preempted by the FDA&#x27;s decision to make the drug available is supported by a number of Supreme Court decisions, including opinions by the traditionally more conservative Justices.

In March 2023, Wyoming became the first US state to ban the pill.

In April 2023, in a lawsuit brought by 17 US states and the District of Columbia, federal district judge Thomas O. Rice issued a temporary injunction that the FDA should not reduce access to mifepristone in these states and the district.

In May 2024, the state of Louisiana classified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances, with penalties for possession without a prescription. The move follows concerns over coerced abortion and has drawn criticism from over 240 doctors in the state.

====FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine====

In April 2023, in the FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine lawsuit, federal district judge Matthew J. Kacsmaryk issued a preliminary injunction suspending the 2000 approval of mifepristone, which would take effect a week later. The Fifth Circuit reversed parts of Kacsmaryk&#x27;s injunction, but placed a temporary injunction on the 2016 REMS change to mifepristone. On appeal to the Supreme Court, the Court stayed both injunctions on 21 April 2023, with only Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas stating their dissent. The stay allowed mifepristone to remain legally available while the lower courts consider the merits of the case.

In June 2024, the US Supreme Court unanimously overturned judge Kacsmaryk&#x27;s Fifth Circuit decision on the grounds that the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine had no standing to challenge the FDA&#x27;s regulations of mifepristone. The Supreme Court ruled that Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine did not demonstrate that they would suffer harm to warrant standing. The Court did not rule on the substance of mifepristone, abortion, or the FDA&#x27;s procedures.

====Subsection H====
Some drugs are approved by the FDA under subsection H, which has two subparts. The first sets forth ways to rush experimental drugs, such as aggressive HIV and cancer treatments, to market when speedy approval is deemed vital to the health of potential patients. The second part of subsection H applies to drugs that not only must meet restrictions for use due to safety requirements, but also are required to meet postmarketing surveillance to establish that the safety results shown in clinical trials are seconded by use in a much wider population. Until December 2021, Mifepristone was approved under the second part of subsection H. The result is that women could not pick the drug up at a pharmacy, but were required to receive it directly from a doctor. Due to the possibility of adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, which may require a blood transfusion, and incomplete abortion, which may require surgical intervention, the drug was only considered safe if a physician who is capable of administering a blood transfusion or a surgical abortion is available to the patient in the event of such emergencies. The approval of mifepristone under subsection H included a black box warning.

====European Union====
Outside the United States, mifepristone is marketed and distributed by Exelgyn Laboratories under the brand name Mifegyne. It was approved for use in France in 1988 (initial marketing in 1989), the United Kingdom in 1991, Sweden in 1992, then Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland in 1999. In 2000, it was approved in Norway, Russia and Ukraine. Serbia and Montenegro approved it in 2001, Belarus and Latvia in 2002, Estonia in 2003, Moldova in 2004, Albania and Hungary in 2005, Portugal in 2007, Romania in 2008, Bulgaria, Czech Republic and Slovenia in 2013. In Italy, clinical trials have been constrained by protocols requiring women be hospitalized for three days, but the drug was finally approved on 30 July 2009 (officialized later in the year), despite strong opposition from the Vatican. In Italy, the pill must be prescribed and used in a clinical structure and is not sold at chemists. It was approved in Hungary in 2005, but as of 2005 had not been released on the market yet, and was the target of protests. Mifepristone is licensed in Ireland for use of abortions up to 12 weeks since it was legalised in 2018. Mifepristone is not available in Poland, where abortion is highly restricted.

Mifepristone 200 mg tablets (Mifegyne, Mifepristone Linepharma, Medabon) have marketing authorizations in the European Economic Area from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for:
* Early first trimester medication abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog (misoprostol or gemeprost) through 63 days gestational age
* Second trimester medication abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog
* Cervical softening and dilation prior to first trimester surgical abortion
* Induction of labor after fetal death in utero when prostaglandin analogs and oxytocin are contraindicated

====Other countries====
Mifepristone was banned in Australia in 1996. In 2005, a private member&#x27;s bill was introduced to the Australian Senate to lift the ban and transfer the power of approval to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The move caused much debate in the Australian media and among politicians. The bill passed the Senate in February 2006, and mifepristone is legal in Australia. It is provided regularly at several specialized abortion clinics per state. Mifepristone 200 mg tablets have marketing authorizations in Australia from the TGA for early first trimester medication abortion when followed by the prostaglandin analog misoprostol through 63 days gestational age and second trimester medication abortion when followed by a prostaglandin analog.

In New Zealand, pro-abortion rights doctors established an import company, Istar, and submitted a request for approval to Medsafe, the New Zealand pharmaceutical regulatory agency. After a court case brought by Right to Life New Zealand failed, use of mifepristone was permitted.

Mifepristone was approved in Israel in 1999.

Clinical trials of mifepristone in China began in 1985. In October 1988, China became the first country in the world to approve mifepristone. Chinese organizations tried to purchase mifepristone from Roussel Uclaf, which refused to sell it to them, so in 1992 China began its own domestic production of mifepristone. In 2000, the cost of medication abortion with mifepristone was higher than surgical abortion and the percentage of medication abortions varied greatly, ranging from 30% to 70% in cities to being almost nonexistent in rural areas.
A report from the United States Embassy in Beijing in 2000 said mifepristone had been widely used in Chinese cities for about two years, and that according to press reports, a black market had developed with many women starting to buy it illegally (without a prescription) from private clinics and drugstores for about , causing Chinese authorities to worry about medical complications from use without physician supervision.

In 2001, mifepristone was approved in Taiwan. Vietnam included mifepristone in the National Reproductive Health program in 2002.

Mifepristone is approved in only one sub-Saharan African country—South Africa, where it was approved in 2001. It is also approved in one north African country—Tunisia, also in 2001.

Mifepristone was approved for use in India in 2002, where medication abortion is referred to as &quot;medical termination of pregnancy&quot;. It is only available under medical supervision, not by prescription, due to adverse reactions such as excessive bleeding, and criminal penalties are given for buying or selling it on the black market or over-the-counter at pharmacies.

Medication induced abortion used to be available in Canada but on a limited basis using methotrexate and misoprostol. Clinical trials were done in 2000 in various Canadian cities comparing methotrexate to mifepristone, after approbation by the federal government. While both drugs had overall similar results, mifepristone was found to act faster. Health Canada gave approval to mifepristone in July 2015. Initially, its use was limited to seven weeks into a pregnancy, but this was changed to nine weeks in 2017. The previous requirement of written consent from the woman was also ended at the same time. It can be dispensed directly to a patient by a pharmacist or a prescribing health professional. Women are required to have an ultrasound to ensure the pregnancy is not ectopic.

Mifepristone was registered for use in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Uzbekistan in 2002, in Guyana and Moldova in 2004, in Mongolia in 2005, and in Armenia in 2007.

Low dose mifepristone tablets for emergency contraception are available directly from a pharmacist without a prescription and with a prescription in China.

Low dose mifepristone tablets for emergency contraception are available by prescription in Armenia (Gynepriston), Russia (Agesta, Gynepriston, Mifepristone 72, Negele), Ukraine (Gynepriston), and Vietnam (Mifestad 10, Ciel EC).

===Controversy===
Many anti-abortion groups in the United States actively campaigned against the approval of mifepristone and continue to actively campaign for its withdrawal. They cite either ethical issues with abortion or safety concerns regarding the drug and the adverse reactions associated with it.

Religious and anti-abortion groups outside the United States have also protested mifepristone, especially in Germany and Australia.

A court case that originated in Texas in 2023 argued that mifepristone was unsafe and women should no longer be able to order it by mail. This case was won in Texas but was appealed, and in June 2024, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously on that case to keep mifepristone available on grounds that those who originally filed the lawsuit did not have standing to file.

==Research==
The original target for the research group was the discovery and development of compounds with antiglucocorticoid properties.

Use of mifepristone as a cervical ripening agent has been described. The medication has been studied as an antiandrogen in the treatment of prostate cancer. Mifepristone showed no detectable anti-HIV activity in clinical trials.

Mifepristone showed initial promise in psychotic major depression, a difficult-to-treat form of depression, but a phase-III clinical trial was terminated early due to lack of efficacy. It has been studied in bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, and anorexia nervosa.

<text>In the mathematical areas of order and lattice theory, the Knaster–Tarski theorem, named after Bronisław Knaster and Alfred Tarski, states the following:

:&quot;Let&quot; (&quot;L&quot;, ≤) &quot;be a complete lattice and let f : L → L be an order-preserving (monotonic) function w.r.t. ≤&amp;hairsp;. Then the set of fixed points of f in L forms a complete lattice under ≤&amp;hairsp;.&quot;

It was Tarski who stated the result in its most general form, and so the theorem is often known as Tarski&#x27;s fixed-point theorem. Some time earlier, Knaster and Tarski established the result for the special case where &quot;L&quot; is the lattice of subsets of a set, the power set lattice.

The theorem has important applications in formal semantics of programming languages and abstract interpretation, as well as in game theory.

A kind of converse of this theorem was proved by Anne C. Davis: If every order-preserving function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;L&quot; on a lattice &quot;L&quot; has a fixed point, then &quot;L&quot; is a complete lattice.

==Consequences: least and greatest fixed points==
Since complete lattices cannot be empty (they must contain a supremum and infimum of the empty set), the theorem in particular guarantees the existence of at least one fixed point of &quot;f&quot;, and even the existence of a &quot;least&quot; fixed point (or &quot;greatest&quot; fixed point). In many practical cases, this is the most important implication of the theorem.

The least fixpoint of &quot;f&quot; is the least element &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;, or, equivalently, such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;x&quot;; the dual holds for the greatest fixpoint, the greatest element &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;.

If &quot;f&quot;(lim &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = lim &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) for all ascending sequences &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then the least fixpoint of &quot;f&quot; is lim &quot;f&quot; &quot;n&quot;(0) where 0 is the least element of &quot;L&quot;, thus giving a more &quot;constructive&quot; version of the theorem. (See: Kleene fixed-point theorem.) More generally, if &quot;f&quot; is monotonic, then the least fixpoint of &quot;f&quot; is the stationary limit of &quot;f&quot; α(0), taking α over the ordinals, where &quot;f&quot; α is defined by transfinite induction: &quot;f&quot; α+1 = &quot;f&quot; (&quot;f&quot; α) and &quot;f&quot; γ for a limit ordinal γ is the least upper bound of the &quot;f&quot; β for all β ordinals less than γ. The dual theorem holds for the greatest fixpoint.

For example, in theoretical computer science, least fixed points of monotonic functions are used to define program semantics, see &quot;&quot; for an example. Often a more specialized version of the theorem is used, where &quot;L&quot; is assumed to be the lattice of all subsets of a certain set ordered by subset inclusion. This reflects the fact that in many applications only such lattices are considered. One then usually is looking for the smallest set that has the property of being a fixed point of the function &quot;f&quot;. Abstract interpretation makes ample use of the Knaster–Tarski theorem and the formulas giving the least and greatest fixpoints.

The Knaster–Tarski theorem can be used to give a simple proof of the Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem and it is also used in establishing the Banach–Tarski paradox.

==Weaker versions of the theorem==
Weaker versions of the Knaster–Tarski theorem can be formulated for ordered sets, but involve more complicated assumptions. For example:

:&quot;Let L be a partially ordered set with a least element (bottom) and let f&quot; : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;L be an monotonic function. Further, suppose there exists u in L such that f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) ≤ &quot;u and that any chain in the subset formula_1 has a supremum. Then f admits a least fixed point.&quot;

This can be applied to obtain various theorems on invariant sets, e.g. the Ok&#x27;s theorem:

:&quot;For the monotone map F&quot; : &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;) → &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;) &quot;on the family of (closed) nonempty subsets of X, the following are equivalent: (o) F admits A in P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;) &quot;s.t. formula_2, (i) F admits invariant set A in P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;) &quot;i.e. formula_3, (ii) F admits maximal invariant set A, (iii) F admits the greatest invariant set A.&quot;

In particular, using the Knaster-Tarski principle one can develop the theory of global attractors for noncontractive discontinuous (multivalued) iterated function systems. For weakly contractive iterated function systems the Kantorovich theorem (known also as Tarski-Kantorovich fixpoint principle) suffices.

Other applications of fixed-point principles for ordered sets come from the theory of differential, integral and operator equations.

==Proof==
Let us restate the theorem.

For a complete lattice formula_4 and a monotone function formula_5 on &quot;L&quot;, the set of all fixpoints of &quot;f&quot; is also a complete lattice formula_6, with:
* formula_7 as the greatest fixpoint of &quot;f&quot;
* formula_8 as the least fixpoint of &quot;f&quot;.

&quot;Proof.&quot; We begin by showing that &quot;P&quot; has both a least element and a greatest element. Let and (we know that at least 0&quot;L&quot; belongs to &quot;D&quot;). Then because &quot;f&quot; is monotone we have , that is .

Now let formula_9 (&quot;u&quot; exists because and &quot;L&quot; is a complete lattice). Then for all it is true that and , so . Therefore, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) is an upper bound of &quot;D&quot;, but &quot;u&quot; is the least upper bound, so , i.e. . Then (because and so from which follows &quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) = &quot;u&quot;. Because every fixpoint is in &quot;D&quot; we have that &quot;u&quot; is the greatest fixpoint of &quot;f&quot;.

The function &quot;f&quot; is monotone on the dual (complete) lattice formula_10. As we have just proved, its greatest fixpoint exists. It is the least fixpoint of &quot;L&quot;, so &quot;P&quot; has least and greatest elements, that is more generally, every monotone function on a complete lattice has a least fixpoint and a greatest fixpoint.

For &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;L&quot; we write [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] for the closed interval with bounds &quot;a&quot; and . If &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, then is a complete lattice.

It remains to be proven that &quot;P&quot; is a complete lattice. Let formula_11, and formula_12. We show that . Indeed, for every we have &quot;x&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and since &quot;w&quot; is the least upper bound of &quot;W&quot;, . In particular . Then from follows that , giving or simply . This allows us to look at &quot;f&quot; as a function on the complete lattice [&quot;w&quot;, 1&quot;L&quot;]. Then it has a least fixpoint there, giving us the least upper bound of &quot;W&quot;. We&#x27;ve shown that an arbitrary subset of &quot;P&quot; has a supremum, that is, &quot;P&quot; is a complete lattice.

== Computing a Tarski fixed-point ==
Chang, Lyuu and Ti present an algorithm for finding a Tarski fixed-point in a totally-ordered lattice, when the order-preserving function is given by a value oracle. Their algorithm requires formula_13 queries, where &quot;L&quot; is the number of elements in the lattice. In contrast, for a general lattice (given as an oracle), they prove a lower bound of formula_14 queries.

Deng, Qi and Ye present several algorithms for finding a Tarski fixed-point. They consider two kinds of lattices: componentwise ordering and lexicographic ordering. They consider two kinds of input for the function &quot;f&quot;: value oracle, or a polynomial function. Their algorithms have the following runtime complexity (where &quot;d&quot; is the number of dimensions, and &quot;Ni&quot; is the number of elements in dimension &quot;i&quot;): 

The algorithms are based on binary search. On the other hand, determining whether a given fixed point is &quot;unique&quot; is computationally hard:

For &quot;d&quot;=2, for componentwise lattice and a value-oracle, the complexity of formula_15 is optimal. But for &quot;d&quot;&gt;2, there are faster algorithms:

* Fearnley, Palvolgyi and Savani presented an algorithm using only formula_16 queries. In particular, for &quot;d&quot;=3, only formula_15 queries are needed.
* Chen and Li presented an algorithm using only formula_18 queries.

== Application in game theory ==
Tarski&#x27;s fixed-point theorem has applications to supermodular games. A &quot;supermodular game&quot; (also called a &quot;game of strategic complements&quot;) is a game in which the utility function of each player has increasing differences, so the best response of a player is a weakly-increasing function of other players&#x27; strategies. For example, consider a game of competition between two firms. Each firm has to decide how much money to spend on research. In general, if one firm spends more on research, the other firm&#x27;s best response is to spend more on research too. Some common games can be modeled as supermodular games, for example Cournot competition, Bertrand competition and Investment Games.

Because the best-response functions are monotone, Tarski&#x27;s fixed-point theorem can be used to prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE) in a supermodular game. Moreover, Topkis showed that the set of PNE of a supermodular game is a complete lattice, so the game has a &quot;smallest&quot; PNE and a &quot;largest&quot; PNE.

Echenique presents an algorithm for finding all PNE in a supermodular game. His algorithm first uses best-response sequences to find the smallest and largest PNE; then, he removes some strategies and repeats, until all PNE are found. His algorithm is exponential in the worst case, but runs fast in practice. Deng, Qi and Ye show that a PNE can be computed efficiently by finding a Tarski fixed-point of an order-preserving mapping associated with the game.

<text>Peter William Postlethwaite, (7 February 1946 – 2 January 2011) was an English actor best known for his work as a character actor.

After minor television appearances including &quot;The Professionals&quot;, Postlethwaite&#x27;s first major success arose through the British autobiographical film &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot; (1988). He had a breakthrough in Hollywood when he portrayed David in &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992) and his international reputation was further solidified when he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;. Following this role, he portrayed the mysterious lawyer Mr. Kobayashi in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and went on to appear in a wide variety of films.

On television, Postlethwaite played Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill in &quot;Sharpe&quot; (1994) and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for performances in &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (1994), &quot;Lost for Words&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Sins&quot; (2000). Director Steven Spielberg called him &quot;the best actor in the world&quot;. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2004 New Year Honours list. Less than one month after his death, he was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as Fergie Colm in &quot;The Town&quot; (2010).

==Early life==
Peter William Postlethwaite was born into a working-class Catholic family at 101 Norris Street in Warrington on 7 February 1946, the son of Mary Geraldine (née Lawless; 1913–2000) and cooper, wood machinist, and school caretaker William Postlethwaite (1913–1988). He had an older brother named Michael (1944–2006) and two older sisters named Patricia and Anne. He would later portray Irish characters on multiple occasions, leading some to mistakenly believe that he was of Irish descent.

Postlethwaite attended St Benedict&#x27;s RC Junior School and a seminary, then joined West Park Grammar School in St Helens, where he enjoyed sports including rugby union. He spent an extra year re-sitting some of his O-levels, and then took four A-levels in English, history, geography, and French. Before his acting career, he trained as a teacher at St Mary&#x27;s College, Strawberry Hill where his chosen subjects were physical education and drama (where he became the first male drama teacher), before training as an actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

He initially trained to be a Catholic priest, but later settled on a career in acting. He trained as an actor at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 1970.

He was a veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company and other acting companies. On 13 January 1981, he took the leading role in a BBC TV black comedy by Alan Bleasdale, &quot;The Muscle Market&quot;, which was a spin-off from &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;; it was part of the &quot;Play for Today&quot; series.

After other early appearances in small parts for television programmes such as &quot;The Professionals&quot;, Postlethwaite&#x27;s first film success came with the film &quot;Distant Voices, Still Lives&quot; in 1988. He received an Academy Award nomination for his role in &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; in 1993. He is well known for his role as mysterious lawyer Mr. Kobayashi in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;. He made appearances in several other successful films, including &quot;Alien 3&quot;, &quot;Amistad&quot;, &quot;Brassed Off&quot;, &quot;The Shipping News&quot;, &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, &quot;Inception&quot;, &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot; and as Friar Lawrence in Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;. 

==Career==
Early in his career, Postlethwaite was advised to adopt a new surname for his acting work by his first agent and by peers who quipped that his name &quot;would never be put up in lights outside theatres because they couldn&#x27;t afford the electricity&quot;. He rejected the advice. He started his career at the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool, where his colleagues included Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce, Antony Sher, Matthew Kelly, and Julie Walters, having an intimate relationship with the last during the mid-to-late 1970s.

In 2003, he toured Australia and New Zealand in a 90-minute one-man play, &quot;Scaramouche Jones&quot;, in which he played a clown trying to find out who he is before he dies at midnight, receiving a nomination for the TMA Award for Best Actor and winning the Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Award for Best Solo Performance. This was directed by Rupert Goold, who would also direct his Lear in 2008, in which Postlethwaite played every character. As well as Australia, the play toured Canada, New Zealand and the UK to great acclaim.

In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot; (2004), Terry Pratchett wrote that he had always imagined Sam Vimes as &quot;a younger, slightly bulkier version of Pete Postlethwaite&quot;.

Steven Spielberg, who directed Postlethwaite in 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;, called him &quot;the best actor in the world&quot;. Postlethwaite quipped: &quot;I&#x27;m sure what Spielberg actually said was, &#x27;The thing about Pete is that he thinks he&#x27;s the best actor in the world. Postlethwaite next starred in a Liverpool stage production of &quot;King Lear&quot; in 2008 at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool, and at the Young Vic, London. He appeared in the climate change-themed film &quot;The Age of Stupid&quot;, which premiered in March 2009.

One of his more notable roles was Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswill in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sharpe&quot; series. The actor said this was one of his favourite roles and that he and fellow actor Sean Bean played well off each other because of their mutual love and respect. Bernard Cornwell, the author and creator of the &quot;Sharpe&quot; series, specifically wrote Hakeswill&#x27;s character in later novels to reflect Postlethwaite&#x27;s performance as the character in the TV series. Postlethwaite co-starred with Bean in &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot;. 

Terminally ill, Postlethwaite made a return to Hollywood in three 2010 films, first as Spyros in &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;. He next appeared in the blockbuster hit &quot;Inception&quot; as Maurice Fischer, an industrialist who is slowly dying. Lastly, his performance in &quot;The Town&quot; as florist and crime boss Fergus &quot;Fergie&quot; Colm was well received by critics, which would earn him a posthumous nomination for BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and making several publications&#x27; lists of Oscar predictions for Best Supporting Actor. His final appearance on screen was in Nick Hamm&#x27;s film &quot;Killing Bono&quot;, based on the memoir of Neil McCormick. The role was written specially for Postlethwaite to accommodate his illness. The film was released on 1 April 2011. He was scheduled to be in the BBC series &quot;Exile&quot;, but had to pull out because of ill health and was replaced by Jim Broadbent.

==Activism==
Postlethwaite appeared as a taxi driver in a political broadcast for the Labour Party during the 1997 general election, and marched in London against the Iraq War in 2003.

In his later years, Postlethwaite was vocal in calling for action on climate change, and installed a wind turbine in his garden; he wrote in &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The stakes [of climate change] are very, very high. They&#x27;re through the roof. How could we willingly know that we&#x27;re going into extinction ... and let it happen?&quot; At the UK premiere of &quot;The Age of Stupid&quot; in 2009, he told then-Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Miliband that he would return his OBE and vote for any party other than Labour if the Kingsnorth coal-fired power station was given the go-ahead by the Labour government.

==Personal life==
Postlethwaite lived in West Itchenor before moving near Bishop&#x27;s Castle. He was a lifelong supporter of Liverpool FC. He began a relationship with former BBC producer Jacqueline Morrish in 1987, and they were married in 2003 at St Nicholas&#x27; Church in West Itchenor. They had a son, actor Billy Postlethwaite (born 1989), and a daughter, Lily Postlethwaite (born 1996).

==Health issues and death==
Postlethwaite was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1990, and had his right testicle removed. A life-long smoker since he was 10, he said during a 2009 interview with &quot;Scotland on Sunday&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to hope the next generation will do things differently. I&#x27;m sure that in 20 years&#x27; time the kids will say: &#x27;Can you believe that people actually used to smoke – put these funny little things in their mouths, lit them and sucked all that crap into their lungs?&quot;

Postlethwaite was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March 2009, and continued acting for the next year and a half, showing clear signs of weight loss during his last performances. On 2 January 2011, at the age of 64, he died at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in Shrewsbury. In his final two years, he worked on his memoir &quot;A Spectacle of Dust&quot; with writer Andy Richardson, which was published in June 2011.

==Awards==

Postlethwaite was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2004 New Year Honours list and received an Honorary Fellowship in recognition of outstanding contribution to the dramatic arts by Liverpool John Moores University in 2005 and an honorary degree from the University of Liverpool in 2006. He received an Academy Award nomination for his role &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; and was posthumously nominated for a BAFTA Award for his performance in &quot;The Town&quot;.

<text>Guillaume de Machaut (, ; also Machau and Machault; – April 1377) was a French composer and poet who was the central figure of the style in late medieval music. His dominance of the genre is such that modern musicologists use his death to separate the from the subsequent movement. Regarded as the most significant French composer and poet of the 14th century, he is often seen as the century&#x27;s leading European composer.

Machaut, one of the earliest European composers on whom considerable biographical information is available, has an unprecedented amount of surviving music, in part due to his own involvement in his manuscripts&#x27; creation and preservation. Machaut embodies the culmination of the poet-composer tradition stretching back to the traditions of troubadour and &quot;trouvère.&quot; His poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer and Eustache Deschamps, well into the 15th century.

Machaut composed in a wide range of styles and forms and was crucial in developing the motet and secular song forms (particularly the lai and the &quot;formes fixes&quot;: rondeau, virelai and ballade). Among his only surviving sacred works, &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot;, is the earliest known complete setting of the Ordinary of the Mass attributable to a single composer. Other notable works include the rondeaux &quot;Ma fin est mon commencement&quot; and &quot;Rose, liz, printemps, verdure&quot; as well as the virelai &quot;Douce Dame Jolie&quot;.

==Life==
Guillaume de Machaut was born around 1300, one of seven children, and educated in the region around Reims. His surname most likely derives from the nearby town of Machault, 30 km northeast of Reims in the Ardennes region.
He was employed as secretary to John I, Count of Luxembourg and King of Bohemia from 1323 to 1346, and also became a canon (1337). He often accompanied King John on his various trips, many of them military expeditions around Europe (including Prague). He was named the canon of Verdun in 1330, Arras in 1332, and Reims in 1337. In 1346, King John was killed fighting at the Battle of Crécy, and Machaut, who was famous and much in demand, entered the service of various other aristocrats and rulers, including King John&#x27;s daughter Bonne (who died of the Black Death in 1349), her sons Jean de Berry and Charles (later Charles V, Duke of Normandy), and others such as Charles II of Navarre.

Machaut survived the Black Death that devastated Europe, and spent his later years living in Reims composing and supervising the creation of his complete-works manuscripts. His poem &quot;Le voir dit&quot; (probably 1361–1365) purports to recount a late love affair with a 19-year-old girl, Péronne d&#x27;Armentières, although the accuracy of the work as autobiography is contested. He died in 1377.

==Music==
Machaut&#x27;s music comprises a wide variety, from complex masses to short songs, and despite the differences of genre, most still contain &quot;typical Machaut motifs&quot;. He lived after the flowering of both the secular troubadour and &quot;trouvère&quot; song movements and the &quot;ars antiqua&quot; church style. The musicologist Gilbert Reaney notes that &quot;before [Machaut], composers either wrote songs or church music. Machaut did both, though it could be said that he neglected the area of liturgical church music.&quot; Besides his mass, Hoquetus &quot;David&quot; and a few Latin motets, Machaut&#x27;s surviving output is exclusively secular. Regardless, Reaney notes that his unique mastery of both secular and sacred Western music is only precedented by the work of Adam de la Halle.

===Secular music===
The lyrics of Machaut&#x27;s works almost always dealt with courtly love. A few works exist to commemorate a particular event, such as M18, &quot;Bone Pastor/Bone Pastor/Bone Pastor.&quot; Machaut mostly composed in five genres: the lai, the virelai, the motet, the ballade, and the rondeau. In these genres, Machaut retained the basic &quot;formes fixes&quot;, but often utilized creative text setting and cadences. For example, most rondeau phrases end with a long melisma on the penultimate syllable. However, a few of Machaut&#x27;s rondeaux, such as R18 &quot;Puis qu&#x27;en oubli&quot;, are mostly syllabic in treatment.

Machaut&#x27;s motets often contain sacred texts in the tenor, such as in M12 &quot;Corde mesto cantando/Helas! pour quoy virent/Libera me&quot;. The top two voices in these three-part compositions, in contrast, sing secular French texts, creating interesting concordances between the sacred and secular. In his other genres, though, he does not utilize sacred texts.

===Sacred music===
Machaut&#x27;s cyclic setting of the Mass, identified in one source as the &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; (&quot;Mass of Our Lady&quot;), was composed in the early 1360s probably for Rheims Cathedral. While not the first cyclic mass – the Tournai Mass is earlier – it was the first by a single composer and conceived as a unit. Machaut was probably familiar with the Tournai Mass since Machaut&#x27;s Mass shares many stylistic features with it, including textless interludes.

Whether or not Machaut&#x27;s mass is indeed cyclic is contested; after lengthy debate, musicologists are still deeply divided. However, there is a consensus that this mass is at best a forerunner to the later 15th-century cyclic masses by the likes of Josquin des Prez. Machaut&#x27;s mass differs from these in the following ways: (1) he does not hold a tonal centre throughout the entire work, as the mass uses two distinct modes (one for the Kyrie, Gloria, and Credo, another for Sanctus, Agnus and Ite missa est); (2) there is no extended melodic theme that clearly runs through all the movements, and the mass does not use the parody technique; (3) there is considerable evidence that this mass was not composed in one creative act. The fact that the movements were placed together does not mean they were conceived as such.

Nevertheless, the mass can be said to be stylistically consistent, and certainly the chosen chants are all celebrations of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Also adding weight to the claim that the mass is cyclic is the possibility that the piece was written or assembled for performance at a specific celebration. The possibility that it was for the coronation of Charles V, which was once widely accepted, is thought unlikely in modern scholarship. The composer&#x27;s intention that the piece be performed as one entire mass setting makes the &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; generally considered a cyclic composition.

==Poetry==
Guillaume de Machaut&#x27;s lyric output comprises around 400 poems, including 235 ballades, 76 rondeaux, 39 virelais, 24 lais, 10 &quot;complaintes&quot;, and 7 &quot;chansons royales&quot;, and Machaut did much to perfect and codify these fixed forms. Some of his lyric output is embedded in his narrative poems or &quot;dits&quot;, such as (&quot;The Cure of Ill Fortune&quot;) which includes one of each genre of lyric poetry, and &quot;Le voir dit&quot; (&quot;A True Story&quot;), but most are included in a separate, unordered section entitled . That the majority of his lyrics are not set to music (in manuscripts, music and non-music sections are separate) suggests that he normally wrote the text before setting some to music.

Other than his Latin motets of a religious nature and some poems invoking the horrors of war and captivity, the vast majority of Machaut&#x27;s lyric poems reflect the conventions of courtly love, and involve statements of service to a lady and the poet&#x27;s pleasure and pains. In technical terms, Machaut was a master of elaborate rhyme schemes, and this concern makes him a precursor to the Grands Rhétoriqueurs of the 15th century.

Guillaume de Machaut&#x27;s narrative output is dominated by the &quot;dit&quot; (literally &quot;spoken&quot;, i.e. a poem not meant to be sung). These first-person narrative poems (all but one are written in octosyllabic rhymed couplets, like the romance, or &quot;roman&quot; of the same period) follow many of the conventions of the &quot;Roman de la rose&quot;, including the use of allegorical dreams (&quot;songes&quot;), allegorical characters, and the situation of the narrator-lover attempting to return toward or satisfy his lady.

Machaut is also the author of a poetic chronicle of the chivalric deeds of Peter I of Cyprus, (the &quot;Prise d&#x27;Alexandrie&quot;), and of poetic works of consolation and moral philosophy. His unusual self-reflective usage of himself (as his lyrical persona) as the narrator of his dits yields some personal philosophical insights as well.

At the end of his life, Machaut wrote a poetic treatise on his craft (his &quot;Prologue&quot;). This reflects on his conception of the organization of poetry into set genres and rhyme schemes, and the ordering of these genres into distinct sections of manuscripts. This preoccupation with ordering his &quot;oeuvre&quot; is reflected in an index to MS A entitled &quot;Vesci l&#x27;ordonance que G. de Machaut veut qu&#x27;il ait en son livre&quot; (&quot;Here is the order that G. de Machaut wants his book to have&quot;).

The poem below, &quot;Puis qu&#x27;en oubli&quot;, is his 18th rondeau.
===Principal works===
* &quot;Le remède de fortune&quot; (&quot;The Cure of Ill Fortune&quot;) (c. 1340s, before 1357) – The narrator is asked by his lady whether the poem she has found is by him; the narrator flees from her and comes to a garden where &quot;Hope&quot; consoles him and teaches him how to be a good lover; he returns to his lady.
* &quot;Jugement du roy de Behaigne&quot; (&quot;Judgement of the King of Bohemia&quot;) (before 1346) – The narrator hears a debate between a lady (whose lover is dead) and a knight (betrayed by his lady); in order to proclaim one or the other the most unhappy, the narrator seeks out the advice of the King of Bohemia who consults allegories, and the unhappy knight is declared the winner.
* &quot;Dit du Lyon&quot; (&quot;Story of the Lion&quot;) (1342) – The narrator comes to a magical island and a lion guides him to a beautiful lady; an old knight comes to the narrator and reveals the meaning of what he sees and gives him advice for being a better lover.
* &quot;Dit de l&#x27;Alérion&quot; aka &quot;Dit des quatre oiseaux&quot; (&quot;Story of the 4 Birds&quot;) (before 1349) – A symbolic tale of love: the narrator raises four different birds, but each one flees him; one day the second (and preferred) bird comes back to him.
* &quot;Jugement du roy de Navarre&quot; (&quot;Judgement of the King of Navarre&quot;) (1349) – Following up on the &quot;Jugement du roy de Behainge&quot;, a lady blames the narrator for awarding the prize to the knight: the King of Navarre is consulted and condemns the poet.
* &quot;Confort d&#x27;ami&quot; (1357) – Dedicated to Charles II of Navarre (who was a prisoner in France), this poetic consolation gives biblical and classical examples (exempla) of fortitude.
* &quot;Dit de la fontaine amoureuse&quot; aka &quot;Livre de Morpheus&quot; (&quot;Story of the Amorous Fountain&quot;) (1361) – The narrator meets a hopeless lover who must separate from his lady; the two men come to a magical fountain and fall asleep, and in a dream the lady consoles her lover.
* &quot;Le voir dit&quot; (&quot;A True Story&quot;) (c. 1362–65) – Often seen as Machaut&#x27;s masterpiece, this poem is an early example of meta-fiction, and tells of the sadness and separation of the narrator from his lady, and of the false rumors that are spread about him. The narrative is stuffed with prose letters and lyric poems that the narrator claims were in truth exchanged by the unhappy lovers and put in the book at the behest of his lady. The work is, however, highly satirical, and mocks the conventional paradigm of medieval courtly literature by presenting himself as an old, ill, impotent poet who becomes the lover of a young and beautiful maiden, who falls in love with him from his reputation as a poet alone. Though the work is called a &quot;voir dit&quot; or true story, Machaut includes many inconsistencies which force the reader to question the truthfulness of his story.
* &quot;Prologue&quot; (c. 1372) – written at the end of his life as a preface to his collected works, this allegory describes Machaut&#x27;s principles of poetry, music and rhetoric, as imparted to him by Nature and Love.
* &quot;Prise d&#x27;Alexandrie&quot; (&quot;The Capture of Alexandria&quot;) (after 1369) – poetic retelling of the exploits of Peter of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem and of Cyprus.

==Legacy==
When he died in 1377, other composers such as F. Andrieu wrote elegies lamenting his death.

Machaut&#x27;s poetry had a direct effect on the works of Eustache Deschamps, Jean Froissart, Christine de Pizan, René d&#x27;Anjou and Geoffrey Chaucer, among many others. There exists the hypothetical (though improbable) possibility that Chaucer and Machaut could have met when Chaucer was taken prisoner near Reims in 1359, or in Calais in 1360, with both poets on official business for the ratification of the Treaty of Brétigny (Machaut with his patron Jean de Berry, who was departing for England, and Chaucer as a messenger to Prince Lionel).

According to food historian William Woys Weaver, fourteenth century nobles at the French-speaking Lusignan court in Nicosia, Cyprus, often listened to narrations of Machaut&#x27;s &quot;Prise d’Alexandrie&quot; for entertainment during royal banquets. Tales like Machaut&#x27;s, about heroic Crusader figures, reinforced the self-image that Lusignan courtiers cultivated as long-distance claimants to Jerusalem.

<text>Oramics is a drawn sound technique designed in 1957 by musician Daphne Oram. The machine was further developed in 1962 after receiving a grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation. The technique involves drawing on 35mm film strips to control the sound produced. Oramics was also the name used by Oram to refer to her studio and business interests generally.

Oram&#x27;s composition machine consisted of a large rectangular metal frame, providing a table-like surface traversed by ten synchronised strips of clear, sprocketed 35mm film. The musician drew shapes on the film to create a mask, which modulated the light received by photocells. Although the output from the machine was monophonic, the sounds could be added to multitrack tapes to provide more texture and create polyphony.

The original machine was exhibited at the Science Museum in London between 2011 and 2015.

== Related techniques ==
The Oramics machine, which creates music from graphic elements uses similar principles to the various methods of Graphical sound production appearing in the 1930s, e.g. Yevgeny Sholpo&#x27;s &quot;Variophone&quot;, which produces sound by reading shapes cut into and drawings on cardboard. Canadian filmmakers Norman McLaren and Evelyn Lambart have made films that feature sounds created by drawing or printing various patterns, such as triangles and circles, along the optical soundtrack area of the film.

In 2016 Tom Richards, a PhD Student at Goldsmiths, University of London, re-imagined and built a working Mini-Oramics machine.

<doc id="181426" wikidata="Q13645132" url="?curid=181426" title="Lord Mayor of Dublin">
<text>The Lord Mayor of Dublin () is the honorary title of the chairperson ( ) of Dublin City Council which is the local government body for the city of Dublin, the capital of Ireland. The incumbent, since December 2024, is Fine Gael councillor Emma Blain who was elected to the position following James Geoghegan&#x27;s election to Dáil Éireann at the 2024 Irish general election. The office holder is elected annually by the members of the council.

==Background==
The office of Mayor of Dublin was created in June 1229 by Henry III. The office of &quot;Mayor&quot; was elevated to &quot;Lord Mayor&quot; in 1665 by Charles II, and as part of this process received the honorific &quot;the Right Honourable&quot; (&quot;the Rt Hon.&quot;). Lord mayors were members of the Privy Council of Ireland, which also entitled them to be addressed as &quot;the Right Honourable&quot;. Though the Privy Council was abolished in 1922, the Lord Mayor continued to be entitled to be addressed as The Right Honourable as a result of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, which granted the title in law. The Local Government Act 2001 finally removed the title as a consequence of the repeal of the 1840 act.

==Functions==
The office is largely symbolic and its responsibilities consist of chairing meetings of the city council and representing the city at public events. Apart from a few reserved functions, which are exercised by the city council as a whole, executive power is exercised by the chief executive, a council official appointed by the Public Appointments Service (formerly by the Local Appointments Commission). Except on a handful of occasions where the city government has been suspended for not striking a rate (a level of local tax), Dublin has had a mayor for nearly eight hundred years.

The Lord Mayor resides in the eighteenth-century Mansion House on Dawson Street.

A privilege enjoyed by the Lord Mayor is to receive the first car registration number in Dublin for each new year. Since 2018, each new Lord Mayor is presented with an official bicycle by the Dublin Cycling Campaign. Nial Ring was the first recipient.

==City regalia==
===Chain of office===

The chain is the outward sign of the office of the Lord Mayor and is worn within the city when performing official civic functions, important ceremonial occasions and also as appropriate at other times, such as opening conferences, new businesses, etc. It is also worn, at the Lord Mayor&#x27;s discretion, when paying visits to such places as schools, churches and the emergency services.

The Lord Mayor of Dublin&#x27;s gold chain of office was presented by King William III to the City of Dublin in 1698. The chain is composed of decorative links including the Tudor rose, a harp, a trefoil-shaped knot and the letter S (thought to stand for Seneschal or Steward). A circular gold medal with the bust of William III hangs from the chain. The previous chain was not returned by Michael Creagh, the Protestant Jacobite Lord Mayor in 1688–1689.

===Dublin city seal===
The city seal dates from 1229/1230 when it was used by the Dublin City Assembly to issue a deed to the Town Clerk. One side shows three watchtowers above one of the city gates being defended by archers, while the reverse side shows a merchant ship at sea.

===Great Dublin civic sword===
The civic sword dates from the 1390s and was made for Henry IV of England in 1399. He gave it to the City of Dublin in 1409/1410.

===Great mace of Dublin===
The Great mace dates from 1717/1718 and incorporates parts of an earlier mace made in 1665 for the first Lord Mayor of Dublin, Sir Daniel Bellingham.

The city sword and Great mace are still used at major civic events such as the Honorary Freedom of the City conferring. All of the above are on display in City Hall, Dublin.

==Lord Mayor&#x27;s coach==

The Lord Mayor&#x27;s coach was built in 1789 by William Whitton, of Dominick Street, and made its first appearance on the streets of Dublin on 4 November 1791 in an annual event to mark the birthday of William III. The elaborately decorated coach far exceeded its original budget and was completed for a total cost of £2,690 13s 5d. The coach was used for ceremonial occasions up until 1932 when, due to its poor condition, it was placed in storage. Following expert restoration, the coach returned to public life in 1976 and is a feature of Dublin&#x27;s annual Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parade.

<text>Delia Ann Derbyshire (5 May 1937 – 3 July 2001) was an English musician and composer of electronic music. She carried out notable work with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop during the 1960s, including her electronic arrangement of the theme music to the British science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She has been referred to as &quot;the unsung heroine of British electronic music&quot;, having influenced musicians including Aphex Twin, the Chemical Brothers and Paul Hartnoll of Orbital.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Derbyshire was born in Coventry, daughter of Emma ( Dawson) and Edward Derbyshire. of Cedars Avenue, Coundon, Coventry. Her father was a sheet-metal worker. She had one sibling, a sister, who died young. Her father died in 1965 and her mother in 1994.

During the Second World War, immediately after the Coventry Blitz in 1940, she was moved to Preston, Lancashire for safety. Her parents were from the town and most of her surviving relatives still live in the area. She was very bright and, by the age of four, was teaching others in her class to read and write in primary school, but said &quot;The radio was my education&quot;. Her parents bought her a piano when she was eight years old. Educated at Barr&#x27;s Hill Grammar School from 1948 to 1956, she was accepted at both Oxford and Cambridge, &quot;quite something for a working class girl in the &#x27;fifties, where only one in 10 [students] were female&quot;, winning a scholarship to study mathematics at Girton College, Cambridge but, apart from some success in the mathematical theory of electricity, she claims she did badly. After one year at Cambridge she switched to music, graduating in 1959 with a BA in mathematics and music, having specialised in medieval and modern music history. Her other principal qualification was LRAM in pianoforte.

She approached the careers office at the university and told them she was interested in &quot;sound, music and acoustics, to which they recommended a career in either deaf aids or depth sounding&quot;. Then she applied for a position at Decca Records, only to be told that the company did not employ women in their recording studios. Instead, she took positions at the United Nations in Geneva, from June to September, teaching piano to the children of the British Consul-General and mathematics to the children of Canadian and South American diplomats. Then from September to December, she worked as an assistant to Gerald G. Gross, Head of Plenipotentiary and General Administrative Radio Conferences at the International Telecommunication Union. She returned to Coventry and from January to April 1960 taught general subjects in a primary school there. Then she went to London, where from May to October she was an assistant in the promotion department of music publishers Boosey &amp; Hawkes.

===BBC Radiophonic Workshop===
In November 1960, she joined the BBC as a trainee assistant studio manager and worked on &quot;Record Review&quot;, a magazine programme where critics reviewed classical music recordings. She said: &quot;Some people thought I had a kind of second sight. One of the music critics would say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t know where it is, but it&#x27;s where the trombones come in&#x27;, and I&#x27;d hold it up to the light and see the trombones and put the needle down exactly where it was. And they thought it was magic.&quot; She then heard about the Radiophonic Workshop and decided that was where she wanted to work. This news was received with some puzzlement by the heads in Central Programme Operation because people were usually &quot;assigned&quot; to the Radiophonic Workshop. But in April 1962, she was assigned there in Maida Vale, where for eleven years she would create music and sound for almost 200 radio and television programmes.

In August 1962, she assisted composer Luciano Berio at a two-week summer school at Dartington Hall, for which she borrowed several dozen items of BBC equipment. One of her first works, and most widely known, was her 1963 electronic realisation of a score by Ron Grainer for the theme of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series, one of the first television themes to be created and produced entirely with electronics.

When Grainer heard it, he was so amazed by her arrangement of his theme that he asked: &quot;Did I really write this?&quot;, to which Derbyshire replied: &quot;Most of it&quot;. Grainer attempted to credit her as co-composer, but was prevented by the BBC bureaucracy because they preferred that members of the workshop remain anonymous. She was not credited on-screen for her work until &quot;Doctor Who&quot;&#x27;s 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;. Derbyshire&#x27;s original arrangement served as the Doctor Who main theme for its first seventeen series, from 1963 to 1980. The theme was reworked over the years, to her horror, because the only version that had her approval was the original. Delia also composed music for other BBC programmes, including &quot;Blue Veils and Golden Sands&quot; and &quot;The Delian Mode&quot;. The Doctor Who story Inferno reused some of Derbyshire&#x27;s music originally composed for other productions.

In 1964–65, she collaborated with the British artist and playwright Barry Bermange for the BBC&#x27;s Third Programme to produce four &quot;Inventions for Radio&quot;, a series of collages of people describing their thoughts on dreams, belief in God, the possibility of life after death, and the experience of old age, voiced over an electronic soundscape. 
In 1966, working with composer George Newson, she collaborated on the BBC experimental radio drama, &quot;The Man Who Collected Sounds&quot; with producer Douglas Cleverdon.

===Unit Delta Plus===
In 1966 while working at the BBC, Derbyshire, fellow Radiophonic Workshop member Brian Hodgson and EMS founder Peter Zinovieff set up Unit Delta Plus, an organisation which they intended to use to create and promote electronic music. Based in a studio in Zinovieff&#x27;s townhouse in Putney, they exhibited their music at experimental and electronic music festivals, including the 1966 &quot;The Million Volt Light and Sound Rave&quot;, at which The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Carnival of Light&quot; had its only public performance.

In 1966, she recorded a demo with Anthony Newley entitled &quot;Moogies Bloogies&quot;, but Newley moved to the United States and the song was left unreleased until 2014. After a troubled performance at the Royal College of Art, in 1967, the unit disbanded.

===Kaleidophon and Electrophon years===
In the late 1960s she again partnered with Hodgson to set up the Kaleidophon studio in Camden Town with fellow electronic musician David Vorhaus. The studio produced electronic music for London theatre productions, and in 1968 the three produced their first album there as the band White Noise. Their debut, &quot;An Electric Storm&quot;, is considered an influential album in the development of electronic music. Derbyshire and Hodgson subsequently left the group, and future White Noise albums were solo Vorhaus projects.

The trio, under pseudonyms, contributed to the Standard Music Library. Many of these recordings, including compositions by Derbyshire using the name &quot;Li De la Russe&quot; (from an anagram of the letters in &quot;Delia&quot; and a reference to her auburn hair) were used on the 1970s ITV science fiction rivals to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot; and &quot;Timeslip&quot;.

In 1967, Derbyshire provided sound design alongside Guy Woolfenden&#x27;s score for Peter Hall&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; with the Royal Shakespeare Company. The two composers also contributed the music to Hall&#x27;s film &quot;Work Is a Four-Letter Word&quot; (1968). Her other work during this period included taking part in a performance of electronic music at The Roundhouse, which also featured work by Paul McCartney, the score for an ICI-sponsored student fashion show and the sounds for Anthony Roland&#x27;s award-winning film of Pamela Bone&#x27;s photography, entitled &quot;Circle of Light&quot;. She composed a score for Yoko Ono&#x27;s short film &quot;Wrapping Event&quot;, but no copy of the film with the soundtrack is known to exist.

In 1973, Derbyshire left the BBC and worked briefly at Hodgson&#x27;s Electrophon studio, where she contributed to the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Legend of Hell House&quot;.

In 1975, she stopped producing music. Her final works included two soundtracks for video artists Madelon Hooykaas and Elsa Stansfield on their short films &#x27; (&quot;One of These Days&quot;) in 1973 and &#x27; (&quot;About Bridges&quot;) in 1975.

===Later years===
Following her music career, Derbyshire worked as a radio operator for a British Gas pipelaying project, in an art gallery, and in a bookshop. In late 1974 she married David Hunter. The relationship was brief, although the couple never divorced. She also frequented the LYC Museum and Art Gallery established by Chinese artist Li Yuan-chia at his stone farmhouse in Cumbria and worked there as his assistant. In 1978, she returned to London and met Clive Blackburn. In January 1980 she bought a house in Northampton, where four months later Blackburn joined her. He remained her partner for the rest of her life.

In 2001, she returned to music, providing sounds used as source material by Peter Kember on &quot;Sychrondipity Machine (Taken from an Unfinished Dream)&quot;, a 55-second track for the compilation &quot;Grain: A Compilation of 99 Short Tracks&quot;, released by Dot Dot Dot Music in 2001. In the liner notes, she is credited with &quot;liquid paper sounds generated using Fourier synthesis of sound based on photo/pixel info (B2wav – bitmap to sound programme)&quot;. The track was released posthumously and dedicated to her.

Derbyshire&#x27;s later life was chaotic due to struggles with alcoholism. She died of renal failure brought on by cancer, aged 64, in July 2001.

==Archive==
After Derbyshire&#x27;s death, 267 reel-to-reel tapes and a box of a thousand papers were found in her attic. These were entrusted to the composer Mark Ayres, who had salvaged the tape archive of the Radiophonic Workshop, and in 2007 were given on permanent loan to the University of Manchester for preservation. The tapes consist primarily of material from Derbyshire&#x27;s freelance projects (e.g. works for theatre productions, films and festivals), some of her BBC work (the majority of Derbyshire&#x27;s BBC work, including the original version of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme, is housed in the BBC Archive Centre at Perivale), off-air recordings of interviews with Derbyshire and recordings of music by other composers and musicians, including Karlheinz Stockhausen, Krzysztof Penderecki and Can. Almost all the tapes were digitised in 2007 by Louis Niebur and David Butler, but none of the music has been published owing to copyright complications. In 2010, the university acquired Derbyshire&#x27;s childhood collection of papers and artefacts from Andi Wolf. Subsequent donations to the archive have included items and recordings from Brian Hodgson, Madelon Hooykaas, Jo Hutton and Elisabeth Kozmian. These collections of material, including Derbyshire&#x27;s working papers and digitised transfers of the tapes, are accessible at the John Rylands Library in Manchester. Material from the archive was used in the Radiophonic Workshop&#x27;s score for the 2018 film &quot;Possum&quot; and provided a source of inspiration for Cosey Fanni Tutti in her soundtrack to the film &quot;Delia Derbyshire: The Myths And The Legendary Tapes&quot; (2020).

==Dramatic and documentary portrayals==
In her 1968 novel &quot;The Bloater&quot;, Rosemary Tonks describes a BBC experimental sound studio based on the Radiophonic Workshop. Tonks had previously collaborated with Derbyshire at the Workshop on a sound poem, &quot;Sono Montage&quot; (1966). Min, the narrator of the novel, resembles Tonks herself, while her friend Jenny was partly based on Derbyshire.

In 2002, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio play entitled &quot;Blue Veils and Golden Sands&quot; as part of its &quot;Afternoon Play&quot; strand, telling the story of Derbyshire and her notable musical work. The play starred Sophie Thompson as Derbyshire and was written by Martyn Wade.

In October 2004, the Tron Theatre in Glasgow hosted &quot;Standing Wave&quot;, a play written by Nicola McCartney focusing on the life of Derbyshire. This was produced by Reeling and Writhing, directed by Katherine Morley, score by Pippa Murphy.

In 2009, Canadian filmmaker Kara Blake released &quot;The Delian Mode&quot;, a short documentary film about Derbyshire. The film won the Genie Award for Best Short Documentary Film in 2010.

In 2013, the BBC showed a television drama depicting the creation and early days of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1963, called &quot;An Adventure in Space and Time&quot;, as part of the celebrations for the programme&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Derbyshire appeared as a character in it, portrayed by Sarah Winter.

Episode 5 &quot;Derbyshire&quot; of the BBC children&#x27;s science TV programme &quot;Absolute Genius with Dick &amp; Dom&quot; is an exploration of Derbyshire&#x27;s creation of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme recording using her techniques on equipment archived from the Radiophonic Workshop.

Coventry-based theatre company Noctium Theatre produced a play named Hymns for Robots about Derbyshire&#x27;s working life, which played at the 2018 Edinburgh Fringe festival.

In 2017, a short film by Caroline Catz, &quot;Delia Derbyshire: The Myths And The Legendary Tapes&quot; (2017) was screened at the BFI London Film Festival. It has been expanded into a feature-length movie that debuted in October 2020.

The 2020 documentary &quot;Sisters with Transistors&quot; touches on Delia Derbyshire&#x27;s work in electronic music and the composing of the Doctor Who soundtrack.

Derbyshire was also featured in episode 4 of Mark Ronson&#x27;s &quot;Watch the Sound&quot; 2021 documentary series on Apple TV+. The episode deals with synthesizers and hails Derbyshire&#x27;s contributions.

==Honours==

Her hometown Coventry named a street after her in November 2016, the &quot;Derbyshire Way&quot;.

A blue plaque was unveiled at Derbyshire&#x27;s former home of 104 Cedars Avenue, Coventry, on 15 June 2017 as part of a BBC initiative celebrating important musicians and venues. The ceremony was performed by former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant along with BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire presenter Vic Minett.

On 20 November 2017, Derbyshire was awarded a posthumous honorary doctorate for her notable contributions to electronic music, by Coventry University, who also erected a plaque honoring Derbyshire, on their Ellen Terry Building. Adjacent to it is a mural depicting Derbyshire. There is a permanent display dedicated to Delia at &quot;Coventry Music Museum.&quot;

In 2022, Coventry University announced that it would name its new flagship Faculty of Arts and Humanities building after Derbyshire. The Delia Derbyshire building was officially opened in May 2024.

<doc id="181435" wikidata="Q3565256" url="?curid=181435" title="Biculturalism">
<text>Biculturalism in sociology describes the co-existence, to varying degrees, of two originally distinct cultures.

Official policy recognizing, fostering, or encouraging biculturalism typically emerges in countries that have emerged from a history of national or ethnic conflict in which neither side has gained complete victory. This condition usually arises from colonial settlement. Resulting conflicts may take place either between the colonisers and indigenous peoples (as in Fiji) and/or between rival groups of colonisers (as in, for example, South Africa). A deliberate policy of biculturalism influences the structures and decisions of governments to ensure that they allocate political and economic power and influence equitably between people and/or groups identified with each side of the cultural divide. 

Examples include the conflicts between Anglophone and Francophone Canadians, between Anglophone White South Africans and Boers, and between the indigenous Māori people and European settlers in New Zealand. The term biculturalism was originally adopted in Canada, most notably by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism (1963–1969), which recommended that Canada become officially bilingual.

Because the term biculturalism suggests, more or less explicitly, that only two cultures merit formal recognition, advocates of multiculturalism (for which biculturalism formed a precedent) may regard bicultural outlooks as an inadequate descriptor by comparison. This was the case in Canada where Ukrainian Canadians activists such as Jaroslav Rudnyckyj, Paul Yuzyk and other &quot;third force&quot; successfully pressured the Canadian government to adopt multiculturalism as official policy in 1971.

In the context of relations between the cultures of deafness and non-deafness, people find the word &quot;biculturalism&quot; less controversial because the distinction between spoken language and sign language commonly seems like a genuine binary distinction—transcending the distinctions between various spoken languages.

In the context of the United States of America, bicultural distinctions have traditionally existed between the US and Mexico, and between the White and the African-American population of the US.

Regions which formally recognize biculturalism include:

* Belgium, divided basically between speakers of French and of Dutch
* Vanuatu, formerly a condominium with both French and British politico-administrative traditions
* the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, retrospectively termed &quot;The Commonwealth of Both Peoples&quot;
* Switzerland, overwhelmingly German and French in language (though with recognition of Italian and Romansch)
* Paraguay, with a population 90% of which speaks Guaraní and 99% of which speaks Spanish
* New Zealand, where the Treaty of Waitangi forms the basis of a relationship between the Crown and Māori iwi (tribes) through which te reo Māori is recognised as an official language, and Māori have protected representation in Parliament through the Māori electorates
*Hong Kong, where both Chinese and English are official languages

Biculturalism can also refer to individuals (see bicultural identity).

<doc id="181436" wikidata="Q7707302" url="?curid=181436" title="Texaco Star Theater">
<text>Texaco Star Theater is an American comedy-variety show, broadcast on radio from 1938 to 1949 and telecast from 1948 to 1956. It was one of the first successful examples of American television broadcasting, remembered as the show that gave Milton Berle the nickname &quot;Mr. Television&quot;.

The classic 1940–1944 version of the program, hosted by radio&#x27;s Fred Allen, was followed by a radio series on ABC (the former NBC Blue) in the spring of 1948. When Texaco (now Chevron Corporation) first took it to television on NBC on June 8, 1948, the show had a huge cultural impact. Once Texaco ended its sponsorship in 1953, the show became known as The Buick-Berle Show under new sponsor Buick, changing to The Milton Berle Show for its final season.

==Radio==
The roots of &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; were in a 1930s radio hit, &quot;Ed Wynn, the Fire Chief&quot;, featuring the manic &quot;Perfect Fool&quot; in a half-hour of vaudevillian routines interspersed with music. Wynn&#x27;s ratings began to slide and the comedian lapsed amidst personal and professional crises, and the show ended in June 1935. Texaco sponsored &quot;The Jumbo Fire Chief Program&quot; in 1935–36 and &quot;The Fire Chief Concert&quot; in 1936.

Comedian Eddie Cantor was the star of a show called &quot;Texaco Town&quot; from 1936 to 1938. The show&#x27;s cast featured young singers Bobby Breen and Deanna Durbin, announcer Jimmy Wallington, who read the commercials for Fire Chief gasoline, Harry Park, and bandleader Jacques Renard. The show was a combination of comedy and music. Cantor frequently sang a tune about the &quot;mayor of Texaco Town&quot;.

&quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; (spelled Theatre for most of the radio show&#x27;s run) was first broadcast on October 5, 1938, and it continued on the air until June 26, 1940. Initial host Adolphe Menjou was succeeded by John Barrymore, who was replaced by Ken Murray. During the almost two-year span, Una Merkel, Irene Noblette, Charlie Ruggles, and Ned Sparks appeared as comedians. Kenny Baker, Jane Froman, and Frances Langford sang, with David Broekman leading the orchestra. Jimmy Wallington was the announcer. The show began as a variety show with dramatizations and songs by guest stars. In 1940, the show became a star vehicle for Allen, with the show re-titled &quot;Texaco Star Theater with Fred Allen&quot; and the program airing on October 2, 1940.

Allen&#x27;s previous sponsor, Bristol-Myers&#x27; Ipana toothpaste and Sal Hepatica laxative, decided to cease their tandem sponsorship of Allen&#x27;s successful hour, first known as &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; and then, for its final season, &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;. He presided over &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; from 1940 to 1942 as an hour-long show on Wednesday and then Sunday nights, and from 1942 to 1944 as a half-hour show, until he withdrew from work for over a year on his doctor&#x27;s advice. It was during the half-hour version of the show that the more cerebral (if barbed) Allen premiered the continuing comic sketch for which many remember him best: the ensemble, topical takeoffs of &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot;. Guests included some of the best comedic actors of the time, including Sam Levene, the legendary Broadway actor and Hollywood film character actor.

Though some believe the title &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; was retired temporarily, in favor of &quot;Texaco Time&quot;, after Allen scaled the show back to a half-hour, the show retained the &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; title officially, the confusion likely stemming from the announcers&#x27; first words of introduction: &quot;It&#x27;s Texaco time starring Fred Allen.&quot; They customarily continued the introduction, as the opening music continued, by referring to &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;. Jimmy Wallington became the show&#x27;s announcer for most of its life with Allen as the feature (he succeeded George Burns and Gracie Allen sidekick Harry Von Zell), though for a brief spell during its third season the announcer was budding radio personality and future television legend Arthur Godfrey. Kenny Baker also remained for the first two seasons, his previous role with Allen&#x27;s &quot;rival&quot; Jack Benny serving for a number of situations, although his role was greatly reduced by 1942, partly because Baker had become difficult to manage, particularly after a controversial performance of &quot;Ave Maria&quot; sung in German weeks after the United States officially entered World War II.

Allen was forced to leave the show in 1944 due to hypertension; he returned with a different sponsor on NBC, while staying with and further refining his half-hour format a year later. &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;&#x27;s next hosts included James Melton (1944–1947), Tony Martin (1947–1948), Gordon MacRae (1948), Jack Carter (1948), and Milton Berle (1948–1949). In 1945 Annamary Dickey was signed to a three-year contract co-hosting the radio program with James Melton through 1947.

==Television==
On television, continuing a practice long established in radio, Texaco included its brand name in the show title. When the television version launched on June 8, 1948, Texaco also made sure its employees were featured prominently throughout the hour, usually appearing as smiling &quot;guardian angels&quot; performing good deeds of one or another kind, and a quartet of Texaco singers opened each week&#x27;s show with the theme song.

They did not settle on Berle—who hosted a freshly revived radio version in spring 1948—as the permanent host right away; he hosted the first television &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; in June 1948 but was originally part of a rotation of hosts (Berle himself had only a four-week contract). Comedian Jack Carter was host for August. Berle was named the permanent host that fall.

He was a smash once the new full season began, &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; hitting ratings as high as 80 and owning Tuesday night for NBC from 8 to 9 p.m. ET. And, as the show landed a pair of Emmy Awards in that first year (the show itself, for Best Kinescope Show; and, Berle as Most Outstanding Kinescoped Personality), Uncle Miltie (he first called himself by that name ad-libbing at the end of a 1949 broadcast) joked, preened, pratfell, danced, costumed, and clowned his way to stardom, with Americans discovering television as a technological marvel and entertainment medium seeming to bring the country to a dead stop every Tuesday night, just to see what the madcap Berle might pull next.

With Berle at the helm, &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; was largely credited with driving American television set sales heavily; the number of TV sets sold during Berle&#x27;s run on the show was said to have grown from 500,000, his first year on the tube, to over 30 million when the show ended in 1956. &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; was also the highest rated television show of the 1950–1951 television season, the first season in which the Nielsen ratings were used.

Uncle Miltie was far from alone in keeping the show alive and kicking. His support players included Fatso Marco (1948–1952), Ruth Gilbert as &quot;Maxine&quot;, Milton&#x27;s love-starved secretary (1952–1955), Bobby Sherwood (1952–1953), Arnold Stang (1953–1955), Jack Collins (1953–1955), and Milton Frome (1953–1955). The show&#x27;s music was provided by Alan Roth (1948–1955) and Victor Young (1955–1956).

As phenomenally popular as &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; was, it was hardly an undisturbed appeal. &quot;Berle presented himself as one part buffoon and one part consummate, professional entertainer—a kind of veteran of the Borscht Belt trenches,&quot; the Museum of Broadcast Communications would observe decades after the show left the air. &quot;Yet even within his shows&#x27; sanctioned exhibitionism, some of Berle&#x27;s behavior could cross the line from affability to effrontery. At its worst, the underlying tone of the Berle programs can appear to be one of contempt should the audience not respond approvingly. In some cases, this led to a surprising degree of self-consciousness about TV itself—Texaco&#x27;s original commercial spokesman, Sid Stone, would sometimes hawk his products until driven from the stage by a cop. But the uneven balance of excess and decorum proved wildly successful.&quot;

Based on episodes that appear on the Internet Archive, it appears the series typically ran 48–50 minutes excluding commercials.

==Title changes==
Texaco dropped its sponsorship of the show and Buick became the new sponsor in 1953, prompting the show&#x27;s name change to &quot;The Buick-Berle Show&quot;. Two years later, it became, simply, &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;, its title until its run ended at last in June 1956. By then, Berle and his audience had probably burned out on each other, and Buick had even dropped sponsorship of the show at the beginning of the 1955–1956 season (opting to sponsor Jackie Gleason&#x27;s half-hour filmed edition of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;), after ratings fell dramatically during the 1954–1955 as well (the higher ratings of his 1955–56 competition, &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; on CBS, did not help Berle either); though Berle would remain one of the nation&#x27;s beloved entertainers, overall, the show that made him a superstar was clearly spent for steam and fresh ideas, and two subsequent attempts at television comebacks hosting his own show lasted barely a year each. (Berle did, however, contribute his part to the making of a rock and roll legend: in his final season, he opened his stage to Elvis Presley amid the beginning of the hip-swiveling singer&#x27;s international popularity.)

Part of the problem was variety shows becoming costlier to produce, compared to the Texaco days when, among other factors, name guest stars did not mind the low appearance fees they got for appearing, because they could bank the exposure they got from even one appearance on the Berle show; or with Fred Allen and Ed Wynn in its earlier radio incarnations.

But part of the problem was Berle himself: with competition (Jack Benny, George Burns, Bob Hope, Perry Como, etc.) crowding him more and more as the years went on, as more television performers and creators found their on-camera legs, and brought new or at least more polished ideas to the air, Berle tried refining his camera persona and evolving from the freewheeling, manic style he cultivated so successfully in the Texaco years. The net result: the balance between excess and decorum now weighted more toward decorum, which wasn&#x27;t exactly what Berle represented at the height of his popularity. He began losing many of his former fans, who preferred when he kept things more unpredictable, and it would be years before his kind of manic balance would find a television home again.

<doc id="181438" wikidata="Q468842" url="?curid=181438" title="Eadbald of Kent">
<text>Eadbald () was King of Kent from 616 until his death in 640. He was the son of King Æthelberht and his wife Bertha, a daughter of the Merovingian king Charibert. Æthelberht made Kent the dominant force in England during his reign and became the first Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity from Anglo-Saxon paganism. Eadbald&#x27;s accession was a significant setback for the growth of the church, since he retained his people&#x27;s paganism and did not convert to Christianity for at least a year, and perhaps for as many as eight years. He was ultimately converted by either Laurentius or Justus, and separated from his first wife, who had been his stepmother, at the insistence of the church. Eadbald&#x27;s second wife was Emma, who may have been a Frankish princess. They had two sons, Eormenred and Eorcenberht, and a daughter, Eanswith.

Eadbald&#x27;s influence was less than his father&#x27;s, but Kent was powerful enough to be omitted from the list of kingdoms dominated by Edwin of Northumbria. Edwin&#x27;s marriage to Eadbald&#x27;s sister, Æthelburg, established a good relationship between Kent and Northumbria which appears to have continued into Oswald&#x27;s reign. When Æthelburg fled to Kent on Edwin&#x27;s death in about 633, she sent her children to Francia for safety, fearing the intrigues of both Eadbald and Oswald. The Kentish royal line made several strong diplomatic marriages over the succeeding years, including the marriage of Eanflæd, Eadbald&#x27;s niece, to Oswiu, and of Eorcenberht to Seaxburh, daughter of King Anna of East Anglia.

Eadbald died in 640 and was buried in the Church of St Mary, which he had built in the precincts of the monastery of St Peter and St Paul in Canterbury (a church later incorporated within the Norman edifice of St Augustine&#x27;s). At that time, his relics were translated for reburial in the south transept ca. A.D. 1087.

He was succeeded by Eorcenberht. Eormenred may have been his oldest son, but if he reigned at all it was only as a junior king.

Settlement of Kent by continental peoples, primarily Jutes, was complete by the end of the sixth century. Eadbald&#x27;s father, Æthelberht, probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590, though the chronology of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately. Æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler Bede as having overlordship, or &quot;imperium,&quot; over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute, and Kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of Æthelberht&#x27;s death in 616, with trade well-established with the European mainland.

Roman Britain had become fully Christianized, but the Anglo-Saxons retained their native faith. In 597 Augustine was sent by Pope Gregory I to England to convert them to Christianity. Augustine landed in eastern Kent, and soon managed to convert Æthelberht, who gave Augustine land in Canterbury. Two other rulers, Sæberht, king of Essex, and Rædwald, king of East Anglia, were converted through Æthelberht&#x27;s influence.

An important source for this period in Kentish history is &quot;The Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, written in 731 by Bede, a Benedictine monk from Northumbria. Bede was primarily interested in the Christianization of England, but he also provides substantial information about secular history, including the reigns of Æthelberht and Eadbald. One of Bede&#x27;s correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine&#x27;s) in Canterbury. A series of related texts known as the Legend of St Mildrith provides additional information about events in the lives of Eadbald&#x27;s children and throws some light on Eadbald himself. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a collection of annals assembled in about 890 in the kingdom of Wessex, also provides information. Other sources include papal letters, regnal lists of the kings of Kent, and early charters. Charters were documents drawn up to record grants of land by kings to their followers or to the church, and they provide some of the earliest documentary sources in England. None survive in original form from Eadbald&#x27;s reign, but some later copies exist.

==Ancestry and immediate family==
The ancestry of Æthelberht, Eadbald&#x27;s father, is given by Bede, who states that he was descended from the legendary founder of Kent, Hengist. However, historians believe that Hengist and his brother Horsa were probably mythical figures. It is known that Æthelberht married twice as Eadbald married his step-mother after his father&#x27;s death, to the consternation of the church.

Eadbald had a sister, Æthelburg, who was probably also the child of Bertha. Æthelburg married Edwin, King of Northumbria, one of the dominant Anglo-Saxon kings of the seventh century. It is possible that there was another brother, named Æthelwald: the evidence for this is a papal letter to Justus, archbishop of Canterbury from 619 to 625, in which a king named Aduluald is referred to, and who is apparently different from Audubald, which refers to Eadbald. There is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this: &quot;Aduluald&quot; might be intended as a representation of &quot;Æthelwald&quot;, and hence this may be an indication of another king, perhaps a subking of west Kent; or it may be merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to Eadbald.

Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury persuaded Eadbald to accept Christianity and give up his wife. He then remarried, and his second wife, according to Kentish tradition recorded in the &#x27;Kentish Royal Legend&#x27;, was a woman named Ymme of Frankish royal blood, though recently it has been suggested that she may have instead been the daughter of Erchinoald, mayor of the palace in Neustria, the western part of Francia.

==East and West Kent==
The surviving regnal lists show only one king reigning at a time in Kent, but subkingdoms were common among the Anglo-Saxons and from the reign of Hlothhere, in the late seventh century, there is evidence that Kent was usually ruled by two kings, though often one is clearly dominant. It is less clear that this is the case before Hlothhere. Forged charters preserve a tradition of Eadbald ruling during his father&#x27;s reign, presumably as a subking over west Kent. The papal letter that has been interpreted as indicating the existence of Æthelwald, a brother of Eadbald&#x27;s, refers to Æthelwald as a king; if he existed, he would presumably have been a junior king to Eadbald.

The two kingdoms within Kent were east and west Kent. Western Kent has fewer archaeological finds from the earliest periods than east Kent, and the eastern finds are somewhat distinct in character, showing Jutish and Frankish influence. The archaeological evidence, combined with the known political division into two kingdoms, makes it likely that the origin of the subkingdoms was the conquest of the western half by the eastern, which would have been the first area settled by the invaders.

==Accession and pagan reaction==

Eadbald came to the throne on the death of his father on 24 February 616, or possibly 618. Although Æthelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian, Eadbald was a pagan. Bertha died some time before Eadbald&#x27;s accession, and Æthelberht remarried. The name of Æthelberht&#x27;s second wife is not recorded, but it seems likely that she was a pagan, since on his death she married Eadbald, her stepson: a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church.

Bede records that Eadbald&#x27;s repudiation of Christianity was a &quot;severe setback&quot; to the growth of the church. Sæberht, the king of Essex, had become a Christian under Æthelberht&#x27;s influence, but on Sæberht&#x27;s death, at about the same time, his sons expelled Mellitus, the bishop of London. According to Bede, Eadbald was punished for his faithlessness by &quot;frequent fits of insanity&quot;, and possession by an &quot;evil spirit&quot; (perhaps referring to epileptic fits), but was eventually persuaded to abandon paganism and give up his wife. Eadbald&#x27;s second wife, Ymme, was a Frank, and it is possible that Kent&#x27;s strong connections with Francia were a factor in the King&#x27;s conversion. The missionaries in Canterbury seem to have had Frankish support. In the 620s, Eadbald&#x27;s sister Æthelburg came to Kent, but sent her children to the court of King Dagobert I in Francia; in addition to the diplomatic connections, trade with the Franks was important to Kent. It is thought likely that Frankish pressure had been influential in persuading Æthelberht to become Christian, and Eadbald&#x27;s conversion and marriage to Ymme are likely to have been closely connected diplomatic decisions.

Two graves from a well-preserved sixth and seventh-century Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Finglesham have yielded a bronze pendant and a gilt buckle with designs that are related to each other and may be symbolic of religious activity involving the Germanic deity Woden. These objects probably date from the period of the pagan reaction.

===Bede&#x27;s account===
Bede&#x27;s account of Eadbald&#x27;s rejection of the church and subsequent conversion is quite detailed but not without some internal inconsistency. Bede&#x27;s version of events is laid out as follows:

*24 February 616: Æthelberht dies and Eadbald succeeds.
*616: Eadbald leads a pagan reaction to Christianity. He marries his stepmother, contrary to church law, and refuses baptism. At about this time Mellitus, bishop of London, is expelled by the sons of Sæberht in Essex and goes to Kent.
*616: Mellitus and Justus, bishop of Rochester, leave Kent for Francia.
*616/617: Some time after Mellitus and Justus depart, Laurence, the archbishop of Canterbury, plans to leave for Francia but has a vision in which St Peter scourges him. In the morning he shows the scars to Eadbald who is converted to Christianity as a result.
*617: Justus and Mellitus both return from Francia &quot;the year after they left&quot;. Justus is restored to Rochester.
*c. 619: Laurence dies, and Mellitus becomes archbishop of Canterbury.
*619–624: Eadbald builds a church which is consecrated by Archbishop Mellitus.
*24 April 624: Mellitus dies and Justus succeeds him as archbishop of Canterbury.
*624: After Justus&#x27;s succession, Pope Boniface writes to him to say that he has heard in letters from King Aduluald (possibly a scribal error for Eadbald) of the king&#x27;s conversion to Christianity. Boniface sends the pallium with this letter, adding that it is only to be worn when celebrating &quot;the Holy Mysteries&quot;.
*By 625 Edwin of Deira, king of Northumbria, asks for the hand in marriage of Æthelburg, Eadbald&#x27;s sister. Edwin is told he must allow her to practice Christianity and must consider baptism himself.
*21 July 625: Justus consecrates Paulinus bishop of York.
*July or later in 625: Edwin agrees to the terms and Æthelburg travels to Northumbria, accompanied by Paulinus.
*Easter 626: Æthelburg gives birth to a daughter, Eanflæd.
*626: Edwin completes a military campaign against the West Saxons. At &quot;about this time&quot; Boniface writes to both Edwin and Æthelburg. The letter to Edwin urges him to accept Christianity and refers to the conversion of Eadbald. The letter to Æthelburg mentions that the pope has recently heard the news of Eadbald&#x27;s conversion and encourages her to work for the conversion of her husband, Edwin.

===Alternative chronology===
Although Bede&#x27;s narrative is widely accepted, an alternative chronology has been proposed by D.P. Kirby. Kirby points out that Boniface&#x27;s letter to Æthelburg makes it clear that the news of Eadbald&#x27;s conversion is recent, and that it is unthinkable that Boniface would not have been kept up to date on the status of Eadbald&#x27;s conversion. Hence Eadbald must have been converted by Justus, as is implied by Boniface&#x27;s letter to Justus. The pallium accompanying that letter indicates Justus was archbishop by that time, and the duration of Mellitus&#x27;s archiepiscopate means that even if Bede&#x27;s dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars, Eadbald was converted no earlier than 621, and no later than April 624, since Mellitus consecrated a church for Eadbald before his death in that month. The account of Laurence&#x27;s miraculous scourging by St Peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of the monastery of St Augustine.

As mentioned above, it has been suggested that King &quot;Aduluald&quot; in the letter to Justus is a real king Æthelwald, perhaps a junior king of west Kent. In that case it would appear that Laurence converted Eadbald, and Justus converted Æthelwald. It has also been suggested that the pallium did not indicate Justus was archbishop, since Justus is told the limited circumstances in which he may wear it; however, the same phrasing occurs in the letter conveying the pallium to Archbishop Augustine, also quoted in Bede. Another possibility is that the letter was originally two letters. In this view, Bede has conflated the letter conveying the pallium with the letter congratulating Justus on the conversion, which according to Bede&#x27;s account was seven or so years earlier; however, the grammatical details on which this suggestion is based are not unique to this letter, and as a result it is usually considered to be a single composition.

The letter to Æthelburg makes it clear that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald&#x27;s conversion reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald&#x27;s acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede&#x27;s defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface&#x27;s letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband&#x27;s side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than before, as Bede has it; Boniface&#x27;s letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.

The story of Æthelburg&#x27;s marriage being dependent on Edwin allowing her to practice her faith has been questioned, since revising the chronology makes it likely, though not certain, that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald&#x27;s conversion. In this view, it would have been the church that objected to the marriage, and Æthelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald&#x27;s conversion. The story of Paulinus&#x27;s consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which is after the latest possible date for Æthelburg&#x27;s marriage. However, it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.

A revised chronology of some of these events follows, taking the above considerations into account.
*616: Eadbald leads a pagan reaction to Christianity.
*616: Mellitus and Justus, bishop of Rochester, leave Kent for Francia.
*c. 619: Laurence dies, and Mellitus becomes archbishop of Canterbury.
*Early 624?: Justus converts Eadbald. Messengers go to Rome. Also at about this time Æthelburg&#x27;s marriage to Edwin is arranged, perhaps before the conversion. Eadbald builds a church, and Mellitus consecrates it.
*24 April 624: Mellitus dies and Justus succeeds him as archbishop of Canterbury.
*Mid 624: Edwin agrees to the marriage terms and Æthelburg travels to Northumbria, accompanied by Paulinus.
*Later 624: the pope receives news of Eadbald&#x27;s conversion and writes to Æthelburg and Edwin.
*Still later 624: the pope hears from Eadbald of his conversion, and also hears of Mellitus&#x27;s death. He writes to Justus to send him the pallium.
*21 July 625 or 626: Justus consecrates Paulinus bishop of York.

This timeline extends the duration of the pagan reaction from less than a year, in Bede&#x27;s narrative, to about eight years. This represents a more serious setback for the church.

==Relations with other English kingdoms and church affairs==
Eadbald&#x27;s influence over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms was less than Æthelberht&#x27;s. Eadbald&#x27;s reduced power is apparent in his inability to restore Mellitus to the see of London: in Bede&#x27;s words, his authority in Essex &quot;was not so effective as that of his father&quot;. However, Kentish power was still sufficient to make alliance with Eadbald&#x27;s relatives attractive to other kingdoms. Edwin&#x27;s marriage to Eadbald&#x27;s sister, Æthelburg, was probably also motivated by a desire to gain better access to communications with the continent. The relationship would have been valuable to Eadbald, too; it may have been as a result of this alliance that Edwin&#x27;s overlordship of Britain did not include Kent. Another factor in Edwin&#x27;s treatment of Kent may have been the location of the archbishopric in Canterbury: Edwin was well aware of the importance of Canterbury&#x27;s metropolitan status, and at one time planned to make York an archbishopric too, with Paulinus as the planned first incumbent. Paulinus eventually returned to Kent, where at Eadbald&#x27;s and Archbishop Honorius&#x27;s request he became bishop of Rochester, and York was not made an archbishopric for another century. Within a year of Edwin&#x27;s death in 633 or 634, Oswald took the throne of Northumbria, and it seems likely that his relations with Eadbald were modelled on Edwin&#x27;s. Oswald&#x27;s successor, Oswiu, married Eanflæd, who was Edwin&#x27;s daughter and Eadbald&#x27;s niece, thereby gaining both Deiran and Kentish connections.

Eadbald and Ymme had a daughter, Eanswith (who founded the very first nunnery on English soil at Folkestone, 15 miles from Canterbury), and two sons, Eorcenberht and Eormenred. Eormenred was the older of the two, and may have held the title of &quot;regulus&quot;, perhaps implying that he held the junior kingship of Kent. He appears to have died before his father, leaving Eorcenberht to inherit the throne. An additional son, Ecgfrith, is mentioned in a charter of Eadbald&#x27;s, but the charter is a forgery, probably dating from the eleventh century.

Several of Eadbald&#x27;s near relatives were involved in diplomatic marriages. King Anna of East Anglia married his daughter, Seaxburh, to Eorcenberht, and their daughter Eormenhild married Wulfhere of Mercia, one of the most powerful kings of his day. Eanflæd, Eadbald&#x27;s niece, married Oswiu, king of Northumbria and the last of the northern Angles Bede listed as holding &quot;imperium&quot; over southern England. Eadbald&#x27;s granddaughter Eafe married Merewalh, king of the Magonsæte.

==Trade and connections to the Franks==
There is little documentary evidence about the nature of trade in Eadbald&#x27;s reign. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade in the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence that suggests that the royal influence predates any of the written sources, and it may have been Eadbald&#x27;s father, Æthelberht, who took control of trade away from the aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods, which was an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself. Kent traded locally made glass and jewelry to the Franks; Kentish goods have been found as far south as the mouth of the Loire, south of Brittany. There was probably also a flourishing slave trade. The wealth this commerce brought to Kent may have been the basis of the continuing, though diminished, importance of Kent in Eadbald&#x27;s reign.

Coins were probably first minted in Kent in Æthelberht&#x27;s reign, though none bear his name. These early golden coins were probably the shillings () that are mentioned in Æthelberht&#x27;s laws. The coins are also known to numismatists as &quot;thrymsas&quot;. Thrymsas are known from Eadbald&#x27;s reign, but few are known that carry his name: one such was minted at London and inscribed &quot;AVDVARLD&quot;. It has been suggested that kings did not have a monopoly on the production of coinage at that time.

Connections with Francia went beyond trade and the royal marriages Æthelberht and Eadbald made with Frankish princesses. Eadbald&#x27;s granddaughter, Eorcengota, became a nun at Faremoutiers, and his great-granddaughter, Mildrith, was a nun at Chelles. When Edwin was killed in about 632, Æthelburg, escorted by Paulinus, fled by sea to Eadbald&#x27;s court in Kent, but in a further sign of her family&#x27;s ties across the channel she sent her children to the court of King Dagobert I of the Franks, to keep them safe from the intrigues of Eadbald and Oswald of Northumbria.

==Succession==
Eadbald died in 640, and according to most versions of the Kentish Royal Legend was succeeded solely by his son Eorcenberht. However, an early text (Caligula A.xiv) refers to Eormenred as &#x27;king&#x27;, suggesting either he was a junior king under Eorcenberht, or had a shared kingship. One suggestion is that the other version of events in the &#x27;legend&#x27;, which gives him no title, may have been an attempt to discredit royal claimants from Eormenred&#x27;s line.

<doc id="181443" wikidata="Q619107" url="?curid=181443" title="Apollo Computer">
<text>Apollo Computer Inc. was an American technology corporation headquartered and founded in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1980 by William Poduska (a founder of Prime Computer) and others. Apollo Computer developed and produced Apollo/Domain workstations in the 1980s. Along with Symbolics and Sun Microsystems, Apollo was one of the first vendors of graphical workstations. Like other computer companies at the time, Apollo produced much of its own hardware and software.

Apollo was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 1989 for US$476 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and gradually closed down over the period of 1990–1997. The brand (as &quot;HP Apollo&quot;) was resurrected in 2014 as part of HP&#x27;s high-performance computing portfolio.

==History==

Apollo was started in 1980, two years before rival Sun Microsystems. In addition to Poduska, the founders included Dave Nelson (engineering), Mike Greata (engineering), Charlie Spector (COO), Bob Antonuccio (manufacturing), Gerry Stanley (sales and marketing), and Dave Lubrano (finance). The founding engineering team included Mike Sporer, Bernie Stumpf, Russ Barbour, Paul Leach, and Andy Marcuvitz.

Apollo was the first to release a standalone workstation. In 1981, the company unveiled the DN100 workstation, which used the Motorola 68000 microprocessor. Apollo workstations ran Aegis (later replaced by Domain/OS), a proprietary operating system with a Unix alternative shell. Apollo&#x27;s networking was particularly elegant, among the first to allow demand paging over the network, and allowing a degree of network transparency and low sysadmin-to-machine ratio.

From 1980 to 1987, Apollo was the largest manufacturer of network workstations. Its quarterly sales exceeded $100 million for the first time in late 1986, and by the end of that year, it had the largest worldwide share of the engineering workstations market, at twice the market share of the number two, Sun Microsystems. At the end of 1987, it was third in market share after Digital Equipment Corporation and Sun, but ahead of Hewlett-Packard and IBM. Apollo&#x27;s largest customers were Mentor Graphics (electronic design), General Motors, Ford, Chrysler, Chicago Research and Trading (Options and Futures) and Boeing.

Apollo was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 1989 for US$476 million, and gradually closed down over the period 1990-1997. But after acquiring Apollo Computer in 1989, HP integrated a lot of Apollo technology into their own HP 9000 series of workstations and servers. The Apollo engineering center took over PA-RISC workstation development and Apollo became an HP workstation brand name (&quot;HP Apollo 9000&quot;) for a while. Apollo also invented the revision control system &quot;DSEE&quot; (Domain Software Engineering Environment) which inspired IBM IBM DevOps Code ClearCase. DSEE was pronounced &quot;dizzy&quot;.

Apollo machines used a proprietary operating system, Aegis, because of the excessive cost of single-CPU Unix licenses at the time of system definition. Aegis, like Unix, was based on concepts from the Multics time-sharing operating system. It used the concepts of shell programming (à la Stephen Bourne), single-level store, and object-oriented design. Aegis was written in a proprietary version of Pascal.

The dual 68000 processor configuration was designed to provide automatic page fault switching, with the main processor executing the OS and program instructions, and the &quot;fixer&quot; processor satisfying the page faults. When a page fault was raised, the main CPU was halted in mid (memory) cycle while the fixer CPU would bring the page into memory and then allow the main CPU to continue, unaware of the page fault. Later improvements in the Motorola 68010 processor obviated the need for the dual-processor design.

Certain efficiencies were gained by careful design; for example, the memory page size, network packet, and disk sector were all 1K byte in size. With this arrangement, a page fault could take place across the network as well as on the individual computer and Aegis file system was a single system of memory mapped files across the entire network. The namespace of the network was self discovering as new nodes (workstations) were added.

Domain/OS (Distributed On-line Multi-access Interactive Network/Operating System) was initially a layer over Aegis and was not built on a Unix kernel. Release 10 incorporated large parts of Unix but the burden of backwards compatibility with previous releases led to a system that was larger and significantly slower than the previous ones. In the end, Hewlett Packard shut down the Domain/OS line. Release 10 came out as competitors were gaining ground in the area of graphics and windowing systems, particularly with the trend to open systems and the X Window System.

Another feature was its proprietary token ring network, which was originally designed to support relatively small networks of, at most, dozens of computers in an office environment. It was a superb design, allowing direct memory access page faulting from any hard drive on the network, but it did not inter-operate with any other existing network hardware or software. The industry widely adopted Ethernet and TCP/IP, a more universal, albeit much slower network. Apollo later added support for these industry standards while continuing to support its own Domain networking using both Ethernet and token ring. The Domain network routing was modeled after Xerox Network Systems.

The company moved from a proprietary data bus architecture in favor of IBM&#x27;s AT-bus, as used in the second generation of IBM PCs, and was simultaneously embracing RISC technology moving towards high-end processors, eventually producing the PRISM line.

The workstation industry in general experienced hard times in the second half of the 1980s, as IBM Personal Computers and IBM PC compatibles began making inroads on their customer base.

Thomas Vanderslice was hired as President and CEO in 1984,
and founder William Poduska left the company in 1985 to found Stellar.

The company incurred large losses in 1987 in currency speculation due to the trading activities of one individual,
and in 1988 from declining demand for its products.
In 1989, Apollo was acquired by Hewlett-Packard for US$476 million (equivalent to $ million in ). HP support for Apollo products was fragmented for the first few years, but was reorganized in late 1992, at which point there were still some 100,000 users of Apollo products and the user group InterWorks had some 4,500 members. Earlier that year, Sun had already offered discounts on its systems for customers trading in their Apollo machines; HP responded the next winter with a trade-in program of its own, that also allowed trading in hardware from Sun and other vendors in return for a discount on HP workstations.

Apollo was gradually closed down over the period of 1990–1997.
