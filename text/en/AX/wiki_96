<text>Rugrats is an American animated television series created by Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó, and Paul Germain for Nickelodeon. The series focuses on a group of toddlers, most prominently Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, and Lil, and their day-to-day lives, usually involving life experiences that become much greater adventures in the imaginations of the main characters.

The series premiered on August 11, 1991. It is the second of the original three Nickelodeon animated series known as &quot;Nicktoons&quot;, after &quot;Doug&quot; and before &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. The series initially lasted for 65 episodes spanning three seasons. Production was then halted in 1993 and Germain left the series, with the last episode airing on November 12, 1994. In 1995 and 1996, two Jewish-themed specials premiered, &quot;A Rugrats Passover&quot; and &quot;A Rugrats Chanukah&quot;, respectively, both of which received critical acclaim. During this time, after the end of the series production run, &quot;Rugrats&quot; began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity due to constant reruns on Nickelodeon.

In 1996, Klasky Csupo Inc. began producing new episodes with a new writing staff, and the series&#x27; fourth season began airing in 1997. As a result of its popularity, a series of theatrical films were released over the next five years: &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, which introduced Tommy&#x27;s younger brother Dil, was released in 1998, &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, which introduced Chuckie&#x27;s stepmother Kira, his stepsister Kimi, and a poodle named Fifi, was released in 2000, and &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, a crossover film with another Klasky Csupo series, &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;, was released in 2003. The final episode aired on August 1, 2004, bringing the series to a total of 172 episodes over nine seasons. The 13-year run ties &quot;Rugrats&quot; with &quot;King of the Hill&quot; as the eighth-longest-running American animated television series. &quot;Rugrats&quot; is Nickelodeon&#x27;s third longest-running animated series, behind &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, and one of the longest-running animated series of all time.

On July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the TV special &quot;All Growed Up&quot; to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the series. The special was a pilot for the &quot;Rugrats&quot; sequel series &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, which aired from 2003 to 2008. It chronicles the lives of the characters after they age 10 years. A spin-off series, &quot;Rugrats Pre-School Daze&quot;, aired four episodes in 2008. Two direct-to-video specials were released in 2005 and 2006 under the title &quot;Rugrats: Tales from the Crib&quot;. Tie-in media for the series include video games, comics, toys, and various other merchandise.

&quot;Rugrats&quot; gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including four Daytime Emmy Awards, six Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, and its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The series became a hit, garnering high ratings, and anchored Nickelodeon as the network&#x27;s top-rated series from 1995 to 2001. Until &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; aired its 173rd episode in 2012, &quot;Rugrats&quot; was Nickelodeon&#x27;s longest-running cartoon.

A reboot of the series executive-produced by the original creative team of Klasky, Csupó, and Germain premiered on Paramount+ on May 27, 2021.

==Premise==
===Setting===

Many of the adventures in which the babies find themselves take place at Tommy&#x27;s house; the parents usually rely on Didi, Stu, or Grandpa Lou (Stu’s father) to babysit the kids while they run errands. Their address is revealed on an invoice in the season one episode &quot;Tommy&#x27;s First Birthday&quot; as 1258 N. Highland, the original address of Klasky Csupo in Los Angeles. However, an unnamed specific city or state is never mentioned in the series. Several indicators, such as a state flag at a post office, license plate designs on the vehicles, and various trips to the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, and the beach, place the characters somewhere in southern California.

The location is also hinted at during the season one episode &quot;Little Dude&quot; when Didi, who is a teacher, takes Tommy to her class at Eucaipah High School, referencing the city of Yucaipa, California. It has been implied that this ambiguity was done intentionally to help give the impression of seeing the world through the eyes of the babies, who would not understand the concept of location. The DeVilles live next door to the Pickles and, midway through the second season, the Carmichaels move in across the street.

===Characters===
The series focuses on the experiences of a courageous, adventurous one-year-old baby named Tommy Pickles and his group of playmates – several other infants and toddlers, some of whom debuted later in the series. His playmates include Chuckie, Tommy&#x27;s bespectacled, red-headed, insecure, cowardly two-year-old best friend, the twins Phil and Lil, noted for their revolting eccentricities, Tommy&#x27;s baby brother Dil, who was born in &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, Angelica, Tommy and Dil&#x27;s outrageously spoiled and selfish three-year-old cousin who is a &quot;rival&quot; of his friends, Kimi, Chuckie&#x27;s adventurous, playful stepsister (later his adopted sister in the seventh-season episode &quot;Finsterella&quot;) who is introduced in &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, and Susie, a good-hearted neighbor of the Pickles family, who protects the babies from Angelica, with whom she often butt heads.

The other characters depicted in &quot;Rugrats&quot; include the babies&#x27; parents, grandparents, and pets. Parental figures include Didi and Stu Pickles, Tommy and Dil&#x27;s mother and father, Chas Finster, Chuckie&#x27;s mild-mannered father, Kira, Chuckie&#x27;s sweet-natured, kind and understanding stepmother (later his adopted mother) whom Chas marries in &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, Drew Pickles, Angelica&#x27;s indulgent and doting father, Charlotte Pickles, Angelica&#x27;s workaholic mother, Betty DeVille, Phil and Lil&#x27;s kind and boisterous feminist mother, and Howard DeVille, the twins&#x27; mild-mannered and soft-spoken father. Grandparents include Lou Pickles, Drew and Stu&#x27;s father and Tommy, Angelica, and Dil&#x27;s grandfather, Lulu, Lou&#x27;s second elderly wife that appeared in later seasons of the series, and Didi&#x27;s parents, Boris and Minka, who are Jewish immigrants. The Pickles family also own a dog named Spike and a cat belonging to Angelica named Fluffy.

In the series, babies talk to each other whenever adults are either not around, or are not paying attention. The babies have a limited understanding of the world. Toddlers Angelica and Susie talk to the babies as well but can also communicate with adults, as they act as a bridge between the two worlds.

==Episodes==

During the first six seasons of &quot;Rugrats&quot;, episodes were primarily divided into two eleven-minute segments. After the second movie, during season seven, &quot;Rugrats&quot; aired with a format of three seven-minute segments per episode, though it returned to its original format in the final two seasons.
==Production==
Episodes took up to a year in advance to produce. After the episode&#x27;s story was written and approved, the next phase consisted of voice recording, storyboarding, pre-eliminating animation, overseas production, overseas delivery, followed by editing and polishing.

===Development===

&quot;Rugrats&quot; was formed by the then-husband-and-wife duo of Gábor Csupó and Arlene Klasky, along with Paul Germain in the summer of 1989. Klasky Csupo had a major animation firm at the time which also provided services for commercials and music videos. Klasky, Csupó, and Germain were also animating &quot;The Simpsons&quot; for Matt Groening at the time, which they would continue to do until 1992 when the series&#x27; producer James L. Brooks and his company Gracie Films switched domestic production to Film Roman. The trio decided to create their own series in reaction to a proclamation by the children&#x27;s cable network Nickelodeon that they were to launch their own line of animated series, which would be later called &quot;Nicktoons&quot;. The network&#x27;s Vice President of Animation Vanessa Coffey approached them to create a pilot for their new series. With the comedic stimulation branching from the antics of Klasky and Csupó&#x27;s infant children and pulling inspiration from The Beatles, the 6–minute pilot episode, &quot;Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing&quot; (which never aired), was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment in 2001.

Peter Chung, along with Klasky and Csupó, co-designed the characters and directed the series pilot, as well as the opening sequence. In a &quot;Decider&quot; article, Chung said, &quot;He [Gábor] wanted the babies to be &#x27;strange&#x27; instead of &#x27;cute.&#x27;&quot; The production was completed in 1990, and they submitted it to Nickelodeon, who tested it with an audience of children. The feedback for the pilot episode was primarily positive. With that, Coffey and then-network president Geraldine Laybourne approved of and bought the series and sent it into production. Chuckie and Angelica were added as characters. Following the success of its first season, Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second season in November 1991.

Germain, who felt that the series needed a bully, based Angelica on a girl bully from his childhood and decided the character would be a spoiled brat. Klasky initially disliked Angelica and also protested her actions in episodes like &quot;Barbecue Story&quot;, where she throws Tommy&#x27;s ball over the fence. In a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article, Klasky said, &quot;I think she&#x27;s a bully. I never liked Angelica.&quot; Klasky disdained Angelica and never fully approved of her character development. Angelica became problematic for some &quot;Rugrats&quot; staff. When her voice actress, Cheryl Chase, had problems portraying a mean Angelica, Steve Viksten, one of the writers, would mention that Angelica was the series&#x27; J. R. Ewing. After seeing Angelica in &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, Klasky commented, &quot;I think she&#x27;s great for the show; I love Angelica.&quot;

=== Writing ===
According to Germain, when the series was first conceived, the rule was that babies can really talk, but keep it a secret from adults. Such as the unaired pilot in which the babies wait for adults to leave the room before speaking to each other. However, the rules quickly began to evolve, and the babies became a metaphor for children of all ages. During production of the first season in June 1991, Germain and his fellow writers would argue among themselves over whether the adults could not understand the babies&#x27; talking, or whether the babies only spoke to each other when adults were not around. During the first season, they tried a little of both, although later in the season, the writers would have the babies talk to each other while adults were in the same room, as long as there was a lot of space between them. By the end of the season, the writers allowed the babies to talk to each other while in their strollers as long as adults were not in the same shot.

===Voice actors===
Through its full run, &quot;Rugrats&quot; had a steady array of main voice actors. E. G. Daily voices Tommy Pickles, except in the unaired pilot where Tami Holbrook provides the voice; Christine Cavanaugh originally voiced Chuckie Finster, but Cavanaugh left the series for personal reasons and was subsequently replaced by Nancy Cartwright in 2002. The fraternal twins, Phil and Lil, and their mother, Betty, are voiced by Kath Soucie; Dil Pickles and Timmy McNulty are voiced by Tara Strong. Cheryl Chase, who initially auditioned for the role of Tommy, was brought on board to be cast as the voice of Angelica Pickles. Dionne Quan voices Kimi Finster. Susie is voiced by Cree Summer except for two episodes when Summer was unavailable, and Daily filled in for her instead. Other regular voice actors include Jack Riley as Stu Pickles, Melanie Chartoff as Didi Pickles and Grandma Minka Kropotkin, Michael Bell as Drew Pickles, Chas Finster and Grandpa Boris Kropotkin, Tress MacNeille as Charlotte Pickles, Phil Proctor as Howard DeVille, Julia Kato as Kira Finster, Hattie Winston as Dr. Lucy Carmichael, Ron Glass as Randy Carmichael and David Doyle as Grandpa Lou Pickles until his death in 1997, after which Joe Alaskey took over until the series&#x27; end. In 2000, Debbie Reynolds joined the cast as Lulu Pickles, Lou&#x27;s second wife, and remained until the series&#x27; end.

=== Animation ===
Overseas animation for the series was done at Wang Film Productions for the pilot and its first-season, and Anivision and Sunwoo Entertainment for the rest of the series. It was followed by editing and polishing before its master tapes were sent to Nickelodeon.

=== Music ===
The theme song for &quot;Rugrats&quot; is composed by Mark Mothersbaugh, who also composed the main music for the series, along with Denis M. Hannigan, Rusty Andrews, and his brother Bob Mothersbaugh.

==Themes==
&quot;Rugrats&quot; visualizes ordinary, everyday activities through the eyes of a group of toddlers. Using their imaginations, the babies transform routine tasks into surprising adventures. The babies, having a limited understanding of the world, constantly mispronounce words and use improper grammar. Challenges often emerge because the babies misinterpret the adults, usually caused by Angelica&#x27;s deceptive translations. The grown-ups of &quot;Rugrats&quot; are simultaneously quirky, over-cautious, and oblivious. The series portrays adults as mysterious eccentrics. Episodes usually center on a moral lesson that the babies learn during their imaginative explorations.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
&quot;Rugrats&quot; was Nickelodeon&#x27;s second Nicktoon, debuting on the same day as &quot;Doug&quot; (which premiered before it) and &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; (which debuted after). After the first run of the series, which was produced from 1990 to 1993, production went on a hiatus, co-creator/co-writer Paul Germain left the series, and episodes that had not yet aired continued to be released through 1994. In 1995 and 1996, two Jewish-themed specials premiered; &quot;A Rugrats Passover&quot; and &quot;A Rugrats Chanukah&quot;, respectively, and the rest of the series aired in reruns. Production on new episodes restarted in 1996 with a new writing staff, and the series aired in Nickelodeon&#x27;s SNICK block from 1997 to 2001. From 1994 until 2012, &quot;Rugrats&quot; was the longest-running Nickelodeon animated series, with 172 episodes produced across its 13-year run.

On July 21, 2001, in celebration of its 10th anniversary, Nickelodeon aired the television special &quot;All Growed Up&quot;, which featured the characters ten years older. After the special, the network aired a retrospective titled &quot;Rugrats: Still Babies After All These Years&quot;, narrated by Amanda Bynes. Because of the special&#x27;s ratings and popularity, Nickelodeon commissioned &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, a series about the older characters, which ran from 2003 to 2008. &quot;Rugrats&quot; ended on August 1, 2004.

===Home media===
Nickelodeon and Amazon.com struck a deal to produce DVDs of new and old Nickelodeon shows, through the CreateSpace service. Using a concept similar to print on demand, Amazon made the discs, cover art, and disc art itself.

===Critical reception and legacy===
Since its debut in 1991, &quot;Rugrats&quot; has received critical acclaim. In a 1995 interview, Steven Spielberg referred to the series as one of several shows that were the best children&#x27;s programming at the time. Spielberg described &quot;Rugrats&quot; as &quot;sort of a TV &quot;Peanuts&quot; of our time&quot;. &quot;Rugrats&quot; was also considered a strong point in Nickelodeon&#x27;s rise in the 1990s. In a press release celebrating the series&#x27; 10th anniversary, Cyma Zarghami stated, &quot;During the past decade, &quot;Rugrats&quot; has evolved from a ratings powerhouse, being the number one children&#x27;s show on TV, to pop icon status. It has secured a place in the hearts of both kids and adults, who see it from their own point of view&quot;. According to Nickelodeon producers, this series made them the number-one cable channel in the 1990s. Jeff Jarvis reviewed &quot;Rugrats&quot; and stated, &quot;When &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was a segment on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;, it was just a belch joke with hip pretensions. As a series, it grew flesh and guts. It was my favorite cartoon. Until I discovered Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Rugrats&quot;, a sardonic, sly, kid&#x27;s-eye view of the world that skewers thirty-something parents and Cosby kids.&quot;

===Controversy===
&quot;Rugrats&quot; was noteworthy among contemporary children&#x27;s television for depicting observant, identifiable Jewish families. Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religious groups gave the series high praises for their special holiday episodes. Nonetheless, at one point the Anti-Defamation League and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editorial page castigated the series for its depiction of Tommy Pickles&#x27; maternal grandparents, accusing their character designs of resembling Nazi-era depictions of Jews.

In 1998, &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; was released, which introduced Dil, Tommy&#x27;s little brother, to the series. Its worldwide gross was $140.9 million against a $24 million budget, though it received mixed reviews from critics. In 2000, a sequel, &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, was released, with three new characters introduced, Kimi, Kira, and Fifi. Kimi would become Chuckie&#x27;s sister and Kira would become his new mother, after marrying his father. Fifi would become Spike&#x27;s new mate and Chuckie&#x27;s new dog.

It was a crossover between the &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. It was the least successful &quot;Rugrats&quot; film both critically and commercially. The &quot;Rugrats&quot; film trilogy has grossed $299.6 million. In July 2018, Paramount announced that Rugrats would release a live-action movie on January 29, 2021. However, in November 2019, Paramount decided to pull the movie from its schedule with no explanation given. In October 2024, it was announced that a new live-action hybrid film was in the works from Paramount and Jason Moore.

=== Live action film ===
On July 16, 2018, It was announced that Paramount Pictures had greenlit a live-action/CGI hybrid feature film which was last set for a January 29, 2021 release date. Originally, it had been set for a November 13, 2020 release, and then was pushed back, with &quot;Clifford the Big Red Dog&quot; taking its old slot. But on November 12, 2019, the live-action/CGI hybrid film was removed from Paramount&#x27;s release schedule. In October 2024, it was announced that the film was back on track at Paramount with Jason Moore on board to direct with Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell setting to pen the script.

===Spin-offs and reboot===

&quot;Rugrats Pre-School Daze&quot;, also known as &quot;Angelica and Susie&#x27;s School Daze&quot;, is a spin-off that follows Angelica Pickles and Susie Carmichael as preschool students. Arlene Klasky and Gábor Csupó were its creators and executive producers. It was announced in 2001 as the first spin-off for &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and initially received a 13-episode order. Though it was reportedly a &quot;highly-anticipated&quot; part of the March 2002 upfront presentation, the series was reduced to four television specials. This decision was reached after Nickelodeon shifted its focus to the &quot;All Grown Up!&quot; spin-off following the rating success of &quot;All Growed Up&quot;. &quot;Rugrats Pre-School Daze&quot; was first shown in the United States between November 2008 and December 2008. The series carried a TV-Y parental rating, meaning that it was judged as &quot;designed to be appropriate for all children&quot;.

In 2005, Paramount Home Entertainment released all four episodes of &quot;Rugrats Pre-School Daze&quot; on the DVDs for the &quot;Rugrats: Tales from the Crib&quot; movies. The first two were released on the &quot;Snow White&quot; DVD, while the last two were on the one for &quot;Three Jacks and a Beanstalk&quot;. The series was once available on the iTunes Store and Amazon Instant Video, but the episodes were later removed from both platforms. All episodes are available on Hulu. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Brian Steinberg felt that the series&#x27; concept could be retooled as part of a &quot;Rugrats&quot; reboot, where the baby protagonists would be shown in preschool and Angelica in kindergarten. On May 14, 2020, it was announced that the reboot was delayed until 2021. it was announced that Nickelodeon had given a series order to a 26-episode revival of the series, executive produced by Klasky, Csupó, and Germain.

The second show, &quot;Rugrats Magic Adventure!&quot;, premiered on June 9, 2000. It ran exclusively at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. It closed in 2001, and was replaced by &quot;Shrek 4-D&quot; in 2003.

====Merchandise====
Merchandise that was based on &quot;Rugrats&quot; varied from video games, toothpaste, Kellogg&#x27;s cereal, slippers, puzzles, pajamas, jewelry, wrapping paper, Fruit Snacks, Inflatable balls, watches, pencils, markers, cookie jars, key rings, action figures, My First Uno games, and bubblegum. The series also managed to spawn a popular merchandise line at Walmart, Kmart, Target, eBay, Hot Topic, J. C. Penney, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, Mattel, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Basic Fun. By March 1999, the franchise had generated an estimated in merchandise sales.

The &quot;Rugrats&quot; had their own cereal made by Post called Reptar Crunch Cereal. The Rugrats and Reptar were predominantly featured on the front, there&#x27;s a board game on the back and a special $3 rebate for Runaway Reptar on the side. This cereal was released for a limited time only, sold at US supermarkets 8/1/99 to 9/15/99 only, and not all supermarkets carried the cereal. To memorialize the movie, Rugrats in Paris, another Rugrats-based cereal came out in October 2000. Simply called the Rugrats in Paris Cereal, it has a similar appearance to Trix; it&#x27;s a sweetened, multi-grain cereal with small-round bits in plain, red, purple and green. Small Eiffel Towers could also be seen. In 2017, entertainment retail store chain FYE began selling Reptar Cereal, as well as Reptar Bars, both based on fictional products within the series. Reptar Cereal is very similar to Froot Loops, and Reptar Bars are chocolate bars filled with green frosting, a reference to the series in which the bars would turn the tongues of whoever ate it green.

&quot;Rugrats&quot; made fast-food appearances as well, with the most appearances being on Burger King. In 1994, the Hardee&#x27;s fast-food chain offered a collection of Nicktoons toys as premiums that were included with kids&#x27; meals at their restaurants. All 4 Nicktoons at that time were featured — &quot;Doug&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;, and &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. Other food items that feature &quot;Rugrats&quot; were Fruit Snacks, Macaroni and Cheese, Bubble Gum and Campbell&#x27;s Rugrats Pasta with Chicken and Broth.

In their first tie-in with Burger King, 5 &quot;Rugrats&quot; toys were offered with their Kids Club meals, a different one with each meal. Each toy came with a 12-page (including covers) miniature version of Nickelodeon Magazine, which featured the toy&#x27;s instructions, word search, picture puzzle, &quot;Say What?&quot;, a scrambled word puzzle, a coupon for Oral-B Rugrats toothpaste and toothbrush, and entry blanks to subscribe to Rugrats Comic Adventures, Nick Magazine, and the Kids Club. From 1998 until 2004, &quot;Rugrats&quot; based-products included watches and various toys.

<doc id="186304" wikidata="Q7740021" url="?curid=186304" title="The Holy Books of Thelema">
<text>The Holy Books of Thelema is a collection of 15 works by Aleister Crowley, the founder of Thelema, originally published in 1909 by Crowley under the title &quot;&quot;, and later republished in 1983, together with a number of additional texts, under the new title, &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot;, by Ordo Templi Orientis under the direction of Hymenaeus Alpha.

== Content ==
&quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot; consists of the wholly class A libri of Aleister Crowley, which indicates that they that are not to be changed, even to the letter. According to Crowley, they were not so much written &quot;by&quot; him as &quot;through&quot; him, and are therefore referred to as inspired works. Additionally, &quot;Liber LXI&quot;, a class D text, is included as an introduction after a preface by Hymenaeus Alpha and synopsis compiled from Crowley&#x27;s writings. &quot;Liber LXI&quot; was originally class A, then changed to class B, indicating works of scholarship, then changed to class D, indicating official rituals and instructions. &quot;Liber I&quot; was originally a Class B document but was reclassified as class A in 1913, and so it is included in &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot;. The majority of these texts were written between the years 1907 and 1911. They are listed in numerical order, following their designation in Roman numerals, with the exception of &quot;Liber XXXI&quot; which immediately follows &quot;Liber CCXX&quot;.

=== &quot;The Book of the Law&quot; ===
&quot;Liber AL vel Legis&quot;, also known as &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;, is the foundational text for Thelema. It is included in both &quot;Liber CCXX&quot; and &quot;Liber XXXI&quot;. The latter is the handwritten original, while &quot;Liber CCXX&quot; was transcribed from the original and was given the number 220 because it is composed of 220 verses. It is the only &quot;Holy Book&quot; that Aleister Crowley claimed to have had no part in the authorship of. Its primacy is indicated in chapter 3, verse 47: 

&quot;The Comment&quot; is sometimes considered to be part of the &quot;Book of the Law&quot;; at other times, it is considered to be a different document. In either instance, it has been understood by some to mean that no discussion of any of the &quot;Holy Books&quot; may take place, despite the fact that &quot;the Comment&quot;, which was written after all of the &quot;Holy Books&quot; were written, only applies to the &quot;Book of the Law&quot;. According to this interpretation, the purpose of &quot;the Comment&quot; is to allow others to interpret the &quot;Book of the Law&quot; for themselves; in other words, no one is to preach its contents or tell you their understanding of it is the one true understanding. However, &quot;the Comment&quot; also prohibits the study of the &quot;Book of the Law&quot;. The stated punishment for violating &quot;the Comment&quot; is anathema (shunning).

=== Original contents of &quot;Θελημα&quot; ===
* Volume I
** &quot;Liber LXI vel Causæ&quot;
**: Briefly explains the history and origin of Thelema and the A∴A∴. This text, being in Class D, is not technically a &quot;holy book&quot;, but was included in &quot;&quot; as an introduction, and is thus listed here.

** &quot;Liber DCCCXIII vel Ararita sub figurâ DLXX&quot;

== Other holy books of Thelema ==
Three libri &quot;containing&quot; class A material (but which are not wholly class A) are excluded from the collection, namely: &quot;Liber CDXV — Opus Lutetianum&quot; (commonly called &quot;the Paris Working&quot;); &quot;Liber XXX vel Sæculi sub figurâ CDXVIII&quot; (commonly called &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;); and &quot;Liber sub figurâ DCCCCLXIII&quot; (commonly called &quot;the Treasurehouse of Images&quot;).

=== Stele of Revealing ===
Despite its significance to Thelema, the Stele of Revealing is not listed as one of &quot;The Holy Books of Thelema&quot;; however, its English translation is included in &quot;Appendix A&quot; alongside supplementary materials. Crowley purports to have authored the text in a past incarnation as the ancient Egyptian priest Ankh-ef-en-Khonsu i.

<doc id="186313" wikidata="Q4194" url="?curid=186313" title="Sauerland">
<text>The Sauerland () is a rural, hilly area spreading across most of the south-eastern part of the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, in parts heavily forested and, apart from the major valleys, sparsely inhabited. 

The Sauerland is the largest tourist region in North Rhine-Westphalia, in particular for mountain biking and cycling, water sports and scenic recreation. The town and Skiliftkarussell of Winterberg in the Hochsauerlandkreis is a major winter sport resort.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Sauerland&quot; is first mentioned as &quot;Suderland&quot; in an official document from 1266. After 1400 the letter &#x27;d&#x27; started to disappear. Therefore, Sauerland = &quot;southern country&quot; is the most convincing meaning, opposed to the theory that Sauer is from the German word &quot;sauer&quot; meaning &quot;sour&quot; (poor &quot;sour&quot; soil). Linguistically, &quot;suder-“ is similar to the Old Saxon &quot;sûðar&quot; (southbound).

== History ==
Before 1800 the western part of the Sauerland was part of the County of the Mark based in Altena; the eastern part adhered to the County of Arnsberg, later became known as the Duchy of Westphalia and was owned by the Archbishops and Electorate of Cologne. The Duchy of Limburg covered a very small area in the lower Lenne river valley. After the Napoleonic Wars the area became part of Prussia and was integrated into the new province of Westphalia. After World War II, Westphalia was merged with the new federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Today, the Sauerland consists of the districts Märkischer Kreis, Olpe and Hochsauerland. The western part of the Hessian district Waldeck-Frankenberg is also attributed to the Sauerland because of its geomorphological, as well as its sociocultural similarity, and the stark contrast to the rest of the adjoining Hessian landscape.

== Geography ==

To the west the hills continue into the Bergisches Land, to the south into the Siegerland, and to the north-east into the Teutoburg Forest. The major rivers of the Sauerland are the Ruhr and the Lenne. Several artificial lakes were created on the smaller rivers by building dams to store water for the nearby Ruhr area, the biggest reservoirs being the Möhne and Bigge. Although the highest elevation of the Sauerland is the &quot;Langenberg&quot; (843 m) near Olsberg, the much more renowned summit, which is well known for the nearby skiing facilities, its weather station and observation tower, is the slightly lower &quot;Kahler Asten&quot; (842 m) near Winterberg. Both Langenberg and Kahler Asten are peaks in the Rothaargebirge mountains.

=== Dams and reservoirs (lakes) ===
The Sauerland has six reservoir lakes.

*Sorpesee
*Biggesee
*Hennesee
*Listersee
*Diemelsee
*Möhnesee

=== Geology ===
The Sauerland is part of the &quot;Rhine Massif&quot; (&quot;Rheinisches Schiefergebirge&quot;) including &#x27;Bergisches Land&#x27;, Westerwald, Siegerland, and, separated by the Rhine valley, the Eifel, Hohes Venn and Hunsrück. The Rheinisches Schiefergebirge was subjected to folding and faulting in the Variscan orogeny in Carboniferous times and eroded to a peneplain in the Permian. The tectonic uplift to the present-day low mountain range began approximately 500,000 years ago and is still going on.

Most of the bedrock underneath the Sauerland originates from a Middle and Upper Devonian period, when it was under a marginal and shallow sea. This has meant that slates, sandstones and greywackes are the most abundant rock types in the Sauerland. In some areas limestones from an ancient reef fringe prevail and are karstified. The Sauerland has several caves, especially in the northern part, the biggest caves being in Attendorn and Balve. In some areas of the Sauerland the occurrence of lead-zinc-silver-ores lead to the development of a considerable mining industry, the center of which was the town of Meggen. Mining in this area lasted until the late second half of the 20th century, today there is no active mining in the Sauerland. The sandstones, greywackes and quartzites of the Sauerland as well as, to a minor extent, the limestones are still exploited in numerous quarries. Some of these caves are now becoming modest attractions to tourists.

== Fauna and Flora ==
Several areas of the Sauerland have the status of biological reserves. 

The biodiversity of the Sauerland is significant. It is the main habitat of many species within Germany, for example for the wisent, the black stork, the Eurasian eagle-owl, the great grey shrike, the red-backed shrike and the whinchat. There have been reports of free-roaming wolves, which had been wiped out in Germany until a few specimens returned to the country in 2000. 

In 2007, Cyclone Kyrill caused severe damage to the coniferous forests. In addition, massive outbreaks of bark beetles have been killing up to 60 % by area of forest in some regions of the Sauerland.

== Towns and municipalities ==


The largest town of the Sauerland is Iserlohn; other larger towns are Lüdenscheid and Arnsberg. Meschede is the home of an abbey. Another abbey is placed at Bestwig.

== Economy ==
Parts of the Sauerland, especially the major valleys in the northwest, represent an old industrial region. The availability of iron ore and the abundance of wood and water allowed iron production long before the Ruhr area industrialisation and the mining of its coal took place. Today there are only a few remains of this early heavy industry; wire production is still important in Altena and a number of small factories still occupy the old industrial areas. Warsteiner is Germany&#x27;s largest privately owned brewery.

=== Tourism ===

Sauerland has become a popular tourist area, attracting many visitors from the Ruhr Area and relatively close Netherlands. The forests and picturesque small towns are attractive for hikers and outdoor sports. There are more than of tagged hiking trails in Sauerland region maintained by Sauerland hiking association (SGV). Some of the towns have the title &quot;Bad&quot; (&quot;Spa&quot;) because of their good air quality and stimulating climate. Winter sports are popular in the Sauerland. The bob sleigh track in Winterberg is widely known in Germany, as well as the ski jumping in Willingen. Sauerland also has a successful theme park called Fort Fun.

Balve Cave is one of the biggest prehistorical caves of Europe and is situated in Balve. The largest accessible limestone cave outside the Alps is the Atta Cave in Attendorn.

=== Transport ===
The Sauerland can be reached by car or train. The drive either via the BAB 4 from Cologne or via the BAB 45 and BAB 46 from Dortmund, takes about one hour; from Kassel or Frankfurt-Rhine-Main (via the Sauerlandlinie) the journey takes about two hours. The closest commercial airport is Dortmund Airport.

* Bundesautobahn 4
* Bundesautobahn 44
* Bundesautobahn 45 (&quot;Sauerlandlinie&quot;)
* Bundesautobahn 46

In the region, railways were once the most important means of transportation, but between 1950 and 1990 many smaller branch lines were closed and rail travel is now only present in the major valleys.

The most important lines are:
* Ruhr-Sieg-Strecke: Hagen – Iserlohn-Letmathe – Werdohl – Finnentrop – Lennestadt – Siegen (2 trains per hour, Abellio Rail NRW)
* Ruhrtalbahn: Hagen – Arnsberg – Bestwig – Brilon – Meschede – Warburg (1-2 trains per hour, DB Regio NRW)
* Volmetalbahn: Hagen – Lüdenscheid-Brügge – Meinerzhagen – Overath – Köln (one train per hour, DB Regio NRW)

<text>Cologne is one of the five governmental districts of the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia. It is located in the south-west of that state and covers the hills of the Eifel as well as the Bergisches Land.

It was created on 30 April 1815, as district of the province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg, when Prussia reorganised its internal administration. In 1972 the Regierungsbezirk Aachen was incorporated.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 190.8 billion € in 2018, accounting for 5.7% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 39,300 € or 130% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 110% of the EU average.

<doc id="186319" wikidata="Q1117835" url="?curid=186319" title="Boricua Popular Army">
<text>The &#x27; (&quot;Boricua Popular/People&#x27;s Army&quot;), also known as &#x27; (&quot;The Machete Wielders&quot;), is a clandestine militant and insurgent organization based in Puerto Rico, with cells in the broader US and other nations. It campaigns for, and supports, the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States.

During their first decade of existence, they had an average of two actions per year. The group claimed responsibility for the 1978 bombing of a small power station in the San Juan area, the 1979 retaliation attacks against the United States armed forces personnel, the 1981 Muñiz Air National Guard Base attack, and a 1983 Wells Fargo bank robbery.

Boricua Popular Army was led primarily by former FBI fugitive Filiberto Ojeda Ríos until he was killed by the FBI in 2005. Ojeda Rios&#x27; killing was termed &quot;an illegal killing&quot; by the Government of Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;Comisión de Derechos Civiles&quot; (Civil Rights Commission) after a seven-year investigation and a 227-page report issued on 22 September 2011.

== Ideology and operation ==

=== Political stance ===
The name &quot;Machetero&quot; was symbolically adopted from an impromptu band of Puerto Ricans who assembled to defend the island of Puerto Rico from the invading forces of the United States Army during the Spanish–American War, between July 26 and August 12, 1898. &quot;Macheteros de Puerto Rico&quot; were dispatched throughout the island, working in cooperation with other voluntary groups including the &quot;Guardias de la Paz&quot; in Yauco and &quot;Tiradores de Altura&quot; in San Juan. These voluntary units were involved in most of the battles in the Puerto Rican Campaign. Their last involvement was in the &quot;Battle of Asomante&quot;, where along with units led by Captain Hernaíz, defended Aibonito Pass from invading units. The allied offensive was effective, prompting a retreat order from the American side. However, the following morning the initial peace accords between the U.S. and Spain were made public. Subsequently, both Spanish and Puerto Rican soldiers and volunteers disengaged and Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States.

=== Hierarchy ===
As established in the EPB&#x27;s &quot;Organization of the EPB&quot;, the organization operates in a systemic and hierarchic structure. The entire organization is overseen by a central committee, which is generally focused on politics and policies. Beneath it lies a military commission, which in turn is divided by sub commissions specialized in finances, intelligence, transportation, provisions and general services and others as needed. Each commando receives additional salary, with specific exemptions being given to marriages, unemployed individuals and those with dependents. In December 1981, the EPB included benefits similar to those in the American military. The organization agreed to medical services and college education pending commission approval. New recruits may be covertly trained in rural farms or in foreign countries (Cuba being an example) and inconspicuous businesses may be used to provide cover to certain individuals. Training includes skills such as lock picking, handling firearms and explosives, forging documents, scuba diving, photography, concealment using makeup and forging license plates. An exercise regime is expected from commandoes afterwards. Meetings are kept to a minimum and only held when relevant.

=== Structure ===
The basic units are the &quot;combat units&quot;, composed of five foot soldiers that are led by a leader with ties to the political branch. Their weapons and munitions are arbitrarily divided by type, such as short weapons and semi-automatic weapons. Rifles and shotguns are present in each unit to ensure balance. A car was also provided and used both for meetings and in incursions without attracting attention. Units in turn subscribe to specific 17-men cells, with three of the unit leaders forming the hierarchy along a pair of political and military leaders. These cells generally aim to have equipment that is comparable to the American military or law enforcement agencies. Additional support cells include trained medical personnel and are mostly in charge of logistics, maintenance, vehicles, equipment and media. Cells form 73-men formations in charge of a political member, which are assigned to specific districts and are generally independent of each other. The EPB usually plans in advance and establishes networks in places of interest, such as those in New York, Boston, Illinois, Texas and Connecticut used in the Wells Fargo heist of 1983.

=== Composition ===
For the most part, individuals affiliated with the EPB are expected to merge into general society and be as inconspicuous as possible, usually holding civilian jobs or studying, some receiving training within the United States military. A newspaper article by stated that Michael González Cruz, a professor who published had estimated that in 1999, there may have been 5,700 members and that in 2005, there may have been 1,100 members (excluding sympathizers).

=== Tactics ===
The group intentionally avoids any area where crime rates could result in frequent law enforcement interventions and commandos are instructed to be polite and are warned to stay away from illegal activities; association or deals with criminal organizations are prohibited. In keeping a discipline code, the organization also discourages the use of alcohol and prohibits the use of drugs. The EPB attempts to stay away from areas where other nationalist groups are based in order to avoid attention. They also settle away from military or police stations. Meetings are generally held in places with good reputation and in buildings that offer several access points, with heavy precautions being taken to reach their locations untailed. If different units are meeting, commandos are instructed to place hoods or masks and use codenames in order to protect their identities, both to accomplish plausible denial and to root out any law enforcement plant. Information is segregated between groups and only shared in limited detail, when necessary. Incriminating or detailed documents or any other evidence is to be destroyed once the potential of a law enforcement intervention is apparent. While involved in a particular mission, the EPB commandoes regularly assume a faux name, but they usually use this to acquire legitimate documents and select a nondescript address in which to receive mail in a fashion that prevents surveillance, such a P.O. Box or a decoy address where mail is delivered to the community in general. Even ammunitions were given codes such as for firearms or for explosives to conceal their nature. Armories were specifically retrofitted to preserve the condition and to prepare new ammunition as needed. Funds are managed strictly and reports are constant in order to keep a balanced budget.

== History ==

=== Early actions ===

The EPB was founded by Filiberto Ojeda Ríos, Juan Enrique Segarra-Palmer and Orlando González Claudio on July 26, 1976, with the date being symbolically used as a reminder of the United States invasion during the Spanish–American War.

Their first communiqué was published on August 25, 1978, following an attack on two policemen that concluded with officer Julio Rodríguez Rivera dead in retaliation for the Cerro Maravilla murders. The federal government claimed the incident was an attempt to steal his police car. On October 2, 1978, the EPB and Volunteers infiltrated an armory and took 500 pounds of ammonium nitrate, dynamite cartridges, 988 blasting caps and 17,500 feet of primacord. In September 1979, the EPB revealed that it was working in conjunction with the Volunteers, FARP and FALN.

On October 17, 1979, the groups executed eight bombings against federal buildings.

On December 3, 1979, a bus carrying 18 American Navy sailors to Naval Security Group Activity Sabana Seca, was forced to stop by a delivery truck. Shortly afterwards, four men appeared from within another vehicle and opened fire, killing CTO1 John R. Ball and RM3 Emil E. White, as well as wounding nine others. On March 13, 1980, the EPB took responsibility for attacking an ROTC vehicle that was moving three soldiers to the UPR.

=== &quot;Pitirre II&quot; ===

In the morning of January 12, 1981, a group of eleven commandos, seven guards and four explosive specialists, set explosives at Muñiz Air National Guard Base, located on the northeastern corner of the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan. The ensuing explosion destroyed nine aircraft (several operational A-7 Corsair II light attack aircraft and a single F-104 Starfighter supersonic fighter-interceptor aircraft being retained for a static display) and two trucks and damaged two ships on loan from the U.S. Air Force, with the authors leaving a machete behind. The destruction of the military equipment ascended to $45–50 million USD.

The FBI responded by receiving permission for a full investigation, which allowed them to employ otherwise forbidden practices to track the group. The EPB in turn expressed pride that the attack represented the most damaging to take place in American soil since Pearl Harbor and expressed satisfaction that it would attract attention to their cause, with some members even considering it a parallel to the Gaspee Affair. The group also sent a video to the media where they explained the composition of the cell in charge of the attack without revealing any identities. The security at the base was criticized in media pieces. The attack later served as the basis for upgrading base security, emphasizing flight line security, at all Air National Guard installations on civilian airports in the United States to the same level as active duty U.S. Air Force installations.

On April 21, 1981, four EPB commandos were able to extract $348,000 from a Wells Fargo armored car, with the group later noting that it would be spent in their cause. In November 1981, the EPB detonated explosives in AEE substations in Santurce, a district of San Juan. When 350 families that occupied a makeshift village in Carolina, Puerto Rico, were removed by the police, the EPB warned the governor that they would retaliate. Afterwards, they made an offensive against the police that resulted in twelve injured and one dead policeman.

On May 16, 1982, EPB members fired rifles at four sailors of the U.S.S. &quot;Pensacola&quot;, killing one of them. The group later took responsibility for the attack and expressed that it was retaliation for a large-scale amphibious attack training named &quot;Ocean Venture &#x27;82&quot; held at Vieques and other military facilities in Puerto Rico. Four days later, On May 20, 1982, the FBI held the EPB responsible for the placement of four defective bombs at the Caribe Hilton Hotel, with the organization denying responsibility. On September 1, 1982, a group of commandos presumed by the FBI to be Macheteros and outfitted with suppressed weapons and wearing military gear and masks, intercepted a Wells Fargo truck in a route between San Juan and Naranjito, but were unable to acquire the cargo. On November 16, 1982, four commandos feigned a heist in a supermarket to redirect those present to its warehouse until their main target, a Wells Fargo truck, arrived.Supported by more armed commandos that arrived in a van, those inside the building gained control of the armored car keys and took $300,000 from it.

=== &quot;Águila Blanca&quot; ===
On September 12, 1983, in an operation entitled (&quot;White Eagle&quot;, the nickname of José Maldonado Román) an EPB agent part of the &quot;Los Taínos&quot; cell named Víctor Manuel Gerena took over the Wells Fargo depot located in West Hartford, Connecticut, stealing a total of seven million dollars.

In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez was convicted on bank fraud charges and became an FBI informant in exchange for a lower sentence. However, due to the EPB&#x27;s policies of anonymity, most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.

Strategically, the group experienced internal divisions between a faction that argued for more offensive and another that wanted to tread lightly in order to avoid justifying the classification of terrorism. While the pacifist faction carried damage control and held two toy giveaways for Three Kings Day in Puerto Rico, Ojeda was removed from the political branch on June 4, 1985, due to these conflicts, being only left in charge of his unit. Besides the boldness of the action, the EPB strategists were also unsatisfied when Ramírez failed to account for food expenses in his report.

Following the indictments against 19 members for the 1983 Wells Fargo heist, the EPB continued operations and on October 28, 1986, joined the FARP and the Volunteers in planting two explosives in a Navy recruit center and a National Guard Building as a warning not to use Puerto Rico as a training center for the Contras of Nicaragua and plans to introduce a logging industry at El Yunque.

=== Killing of Ojeda Ríos ===
On September 23, 2005, the anniversary of (&quot;The Cry of Lares&quot;) members of the FBI San Juan field office surrounded a modest home in the outskirts of the town of Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, where Ojeda Ríos was believed to be living in. The FBI claims that it was performing surveillance of the area because of reports that Ojeda Ríos had been seen in the home. In their press release, the FBI stated their surveillance team was detected, and proceeded to serve an arrest warrant against Ojeda Ríos. The FBI claims that as the agents approached the home, shots were fired from inside and outside the house wounding an FBI agent. The FBI alleges it then returned fire fatally wounding Ojeda Ríos.

A subsequent autopsy of Ojeda&#x27;s body determined that he bled to death over the course of 15 to 30 minutes. The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Civil Rights Commission started an investigation of the incident shortly after Ojeda Rios&#x27; death that lasted 7 years. The 227-page report issued on 22 September 2011 stated that Ojeda Rios&#x27;s killing was &quot;an illegal killing&quot; by the FBI.

=== Change in guard; Comandante Guasábara ===
Following the confrontation that concluded in the death of its former leader, the command of the Boricua Popular Army was inherited by an anonymous figure known as &quot;Comandante Guasábara&quot;, named after the Taíno word for &quot;war&quot;. Under his leadership, the group appears to have shifted its focus towards intelligence. For example, the group has not recorded a single military action. Instead, Guasábara has generally used the media to publish classified information. Under Guasábara, the &quot;Macheteros&quot; took an emphasis on publishing pieces regarding the use of Culebra and Vieques as bombing targets for the U.S. Navy; what they perceive as a disproportionate number of military bases on the island (compared to states in the Union); the proportion of deaths within the ranks of the Independence and Nationalist leadership, including the alleged experimentation with radiation on Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos while he was incarcerated; the secret testing of Agent Orange on Puerto Rican soil; and cancer &quot;experiments&quot; administered by Cornelius P. Rhoads, in which he claimed to have killed Puerto Rican patients and injected cancer cells to others, while working as part of a medical investigation conducted in San Juan&#x27;s Presbyterian Hospital for the Rockefeller Institute.

=== Opposition to the Fortuño administration (2009–2012) ===
The Boricua Popular Army took credit for denouncing what was called &quot;paramilitary training&quot; that private corporation Triangle Experience Group was carrying on in the mountains of the municipality of Utuado. The media later revealed that these exercises were being done illegally, in covert fashion and lacking the required permits.

===Opposition to the García administration (2013–2017)===
On March 9, 2015, Commander Guasábara issued a press release where it attacked the Value Added Tax proposal (better known by its Spanish acronyms &quot;IVA&quot;) supported by the Garcia Padilla administration as part of its response to the Puerto Rican debt crisis.

Later that month, the EPB issued a statement where they expressed the belief that a joint drill organized by Garcia Padilla&#x27;s administration in collaboration with the federal government was in fact a military exercise that was organized to advance the Obama administration&#x27;s campaign against the socialist government of Venezuela. Known as Operación Respuesta Borinqueña (literally &quot;Operation Puerto Rican Response&quot;) and held March 16–21, the training was officially described as a first response practice in an emergency involving tsunamis or a chemical attack. However, Commander Guasábara expressed that a reunion held in the Dominican Republic with the official purpose of coordinating the drill was in fact a reunion between military officials of that nation, Puerto Rico and the United States, which was planned the year before with the collaboration of Venezuelan opposition leaders Carlos M. Tamayo and Carlos Fernandez (collectively known as &quot;Los Carlos&quot;). The Macheteros claims that the representatives of the Puerto Rico national guard protested when the topic was discussed, but the training went ahead unchanged with the supervision of several American generals, including the heads of the USNORTHCOM and USSOUTHCOM. The statement concludes by noting that the EBP&#x27;s Intelligence Division had been monitoring military exercises carried out by the United States armed forces in the municipalities of Utuado and Lares, also being aware of the presence of a military helicopter in the region.

On July 11, 2015, the EPB issued another statement, this time warning that &quot;they will do what is necessary&quot; according to the moment&#x27;s circumstances and that &quot;the people should not pay a debt that does not belong to the people&quot;. Thorough its spokesman, the group anticipated that &quot;[in its] ineptitude and impotency&quot; the government would exploit the crisis to privatize profits and socialize losses, citing the privatization of the turnpike system, Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company and the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge as previous examples of this tendency. The EBP expressed dissatisfaction in what they perceived as &quot;an environment of indifference&quot; within sectors of local society that &quot;still expect magic solutions&quot; from those responsible for the crisis, which serves as a hindrance to the militant action that they pursue. Commander Guasábara then offers an alliance that oversees previous differences. In asking the rhetoric question &quot;What would you do for yourself, your children and your country?&quot; the Macheteros urged the public to hold an investigation and &quot;judge those responsible&quot; for what they consider an &quot;irresponsible and unnecessary debt [caused by] the corrupt administrations that we have tolerated for 50 years&quot;. The EPB concluded this press release by urging the public to &quot;take the streets and manifest their anger in the way that they prefer&quot;, but not before stating that the time for marches was gone and that it is &quot;time to take action&quot;.

== Classification ==

=== Local arguments ===
Supporters of independence for Puerto Rico argue that the U.S. favored the establishment of the present Commonwealth status to create a perpetual consumer base for U.S. and foreign products and services. Foreign products and services are redirected to Puerto Rico and other &quot;unincorporated&quot; lands of the United States to satisfy a portion of foreign trade agreements, while allowing domestic products and services a greater &quot;home&quot; market share. Another argument by the independence movement is that the &quot;Macheteros&quot; are continuing the historical rebellion that Puerto Ricans such as Pedro Albizu Campos and the Nationalist Party have waged, against U.S. domination of the island. It is known, for example, that Los Macheteros deliberately chose September 12 for their &quot;Águila&quot; Blanca assault on the Wells Fargo depot, because September 12 was the birthday of Puerto Rican Nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. Beginning in the 1960s, the FBI infiltrated Puerto Rico&#x27;s free press and political circles in order to monitor and disrupt efforts related to independence movements like Los Macheteros. This operation was part of COINTELPRO. The EPB&#x27;s rebuttal to being classified as a terrorist organization is that per the definition adopted in the 1979 Conference on International Terrorism that posits &quot;deliberate, systematic murder, maiming and menacing of the innocent to inspire fear in order to earn political gains&quot;, they do not qualify as such since their targets are strictly the American military or law enforcement and that they have never targeted civilians.

=== Federal stance ===
The FBI classifies the EPB as a terrorist organization based on their definition of the term, &quot;[the use of] force or violence [...] in furtherance of political or social objectives&quot;, without specification on the target. In 1982, the Senate Subcommittee on the Administration of Internal Security Act compiled a paper titled &quot;The Cuban Connection to Puerto Rican Terrorism&quot; where it claimed that Ojeda was an agent of the Cuban government and in which the FBI knowing where he operated. After the application of the Levi guidelines, only eight groups were classified as requiring full investigation. Of them, five were based in Puerto Rico and besides the EPB also included the FARP, FALN, COR and MLN. In 2001, then-FBI Director Louis J. Freeh reaffirmed the agency&#x27;s historical stance that the group committed acts of terrorism. 

=== Other assessments ===
In his book &quot;Los Macheteros: The Wells Fargo Robbery and the Violent Struggle for Puerto Rican Independence&quot;, Spanish-American author Ronald Fernández argued that based on the descriptions of terrorism and revolutionary violence in books like Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s &quot;Terrorism: How the West can Win&quot; or Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;The Rebel&quot;, the EPB would not be classified as a terrorist organization, since that would require them to target &quot;anyone except soldiers&quot; and the use of fear as a tactic. Whereas, the organization&#x27;s target selection, namely the US military/federal government and the avoidance of civilians fits into the classification of a guerrilla or revolutionary group. The author does not condone violence, but uses Camus&#x27; argument on &quot;necessary&quot; rebel violence as inexcusable but still &quot;historically necessary&quot;. To this end, Fernández identifies that from the EPB&#x27;s point of view, the deaths at Sabana Seca were &quot;terrible but necessary&quot; despite personally disagreeing, while considering the destruction of military vehicles at Sabana Seca justified from a rebel&#x27;s standpoint. Ultimately, the author concludes that such labeling could be of political convenience to the federal government, serving to &quot;shift the blame for any attacks on U.S. policy or personnel from us to them&quot;.

== Cultural impact ==

=== In art and film ===
An 80-minute fictional film about a Puerto Rican from New York City who declares himself a self styled machetero, titled &quot;MACHETERO&quot;, was released in 2008. Starring Not4Prophet (Ricanstruction, X-Vandals, Abrazos Army), as Pedro Taíno, and Isaach De Bankolé (&quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Ghostdog, Black Panther), as French journalist Jean Dumont, the film takes place in both New York City and Puerto Rico. Other actors include Kelvin Fernández (first starring role) and professed former political prisoner, Dylcia Pagán. The film was the winner of the 2008 South Africa International Film Festival, 2009 Swansea Film Festival, 2009 Heart of England Film Festival, 2009 International Film Festival Thailand, and the 2009 International Film Festival Ireland.

The first single published by band Calle 13 was &quot;Querido FBI&quot;, which was extra-officially released before their debut album, a response to the events of September 23, 2005. It is a protest song, directly addressing the circumstances surrounding the death of Ojeda Ríos. A song was also released by the Hip Hop group, X-Vandals (Not4Prophet and DJ Johnny Juice) entitled Todos Somos Machetero in 2007.

Likewise, the event led to the creation of murals. Some were painted by student movements such as one at UPR Río Piedras, whereas others were painted by urban artists.

=== Other depictions ===
The polarizing nature of the organization have also been exploited in the local professional wrestling industry by wrestlers such as Israel &quot;Joseph RPM&quot; Rodríguez, who integrated the moniker of &quot;El Machetero Mayor&quot; (Spanish for &quot;The Grandest Machetero&quot;) into his ring name and performed as such throughout Puerto Rico as a member of several independent promotions and the World Wrestling League.

<text>USS &quot;Thompson&quot; (DD-305), a of the U.S. Navy named in honor of Secretary of the Navy Richard W. Thompson (1809–1900), never saw action against an enemy. She was the first Navy ship of that name; the second, , named for Robert M. Thompson, served during World War II and the Korean War.

==History==

The keel of the first &quot;Thompson&quot; was laid down on 25 September 1918, at San Francisco, by the Bethlehem Steel Corporation. She was launched on 15 January 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Herbert H. Harris, and was commissioned at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California, on 16 August 1920.

On 4 September, &quot;Thompson&quot; departed San Francisco for a shakedown training cruise which took her as far southward as Magdalena Bay in Baja California Sur. She returned to San Diego, on 29 September, to operate with the Battle Fleet as part of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 32, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 11. After initial fleet operations off the west coast, &quot;Thompson&quot; departed from San Diego on 7 January 1921, to take part in fleet maneuvers off Panama and later off the Chilean coast, south of Valparaíso.

Departing from Valparaíso on 4 February, she steamed with DesDiv 32 to Balboa, Canal Zone, and thence to La Unión, El Salvador. Departing that port on 27 February, she proceeded north and soon resumed operations out of San Diego. Her cruises ranged as far north as Seattle, Washington.

Following her return from exercises to the northward on 21 June she operated off the California coast. On 10 December she departed San Diego and steamed to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, for regular overhaul.

Upon completion of the refit, &quot;Thompson&quot; headed for San Diego on 8 February 1922, for resumption of operations with the Battle Fleet. In the following years, she worked out of San Diego and took part in winter and spring maneuvers off Panama, on occasion transiting the Panama Canal for fleet exercises in the Caribbean Sea.

On 15 April 1926, &quot;Thompson&quot; steamed with the Fleet from San Francisco for fleet problems in Hawaiian waters. Upon completion of this training on 1 July she departed Pearl Harbor with the Fleet, bound for a goodwill cruise to Australia and New Zealand. After calling at Pago Pago, Samoa, on 10 and 11 July, she arrived in Melbourne on 23 July. In company with sister ships , , and , &quot;Thompson&quot; left Melbourne on 6 August and made port at Dunedin, New Zealand, four days later.

Putting out to sea after a 10-day visit there, &quot;Thompson&quot; visited Wellington from 22 to 24 August. She then proceeded home across the Pacific, via Pago Pago and Pearl Harbor, and reached San Diego on 26 September.

For the remainder of her career, &quot;Thompson&quot; continued her operations with DesDiv 32, DesRon 11. Early the next year, she made a brief visit to the east coast, calling at Norfolk, Virginia, Newport, Rhode Island, and New York City, before returning to San Diego and serving out the rest of her days in operations along the west coast.

Under the terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty limiting naval tonnage and armaments, &quot;Thompson&quot; was decommissioned on 4 April 1930, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 22 June 1930; and sold for scrap on 10 June.

==Fate==
Following her sale, she served as a floating restaurant in lower San Francisco Bay during the depression years of the 1930s. In February 1944, the Navy repurchased the ship and partly sank her in the mud flats of San Francisco Bay, south of the San Mateo Bridge, where Army and Navy aircraft carried out bombing runs with dummy bombs.

Portions of the wreck remain above the waterline to this day. She is commonly referred to as the &quot;South Bay Wreck&quot; and many tide tables reference her as a calculation point.

<text>USS &quot;Thompson&quot; (DD-627) (later DMS-38) was first a , then became an &quot;Ellyson&quot;-class destroyer minesweeper. She was the second Navy ship named &quot;Thompson&quot;, and the first named in honor of Robert M. Thompson.

==World War II==

The keel of the second &quot;Thompson&quot; was laid down on 22 September 1941, at Seattle, Washington, by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation. She was launched on 15 July 1942, sponsored by Miss Sara Thompson Ross, and commissioned on 10 July 1943.

Following operations along the west coast, &quot;Thompson&quot; departed San Diego, on 19 August, bound for the east coast. She arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 1 September, prior to departing the next day for the coast of Maine and arriving at Casco Bay on 3 September. The destroyer then headed south to the Boston Navy Yard where she underwent repairs. She next engaged in exercises off the Massachusetts coast before returning to Casco Bay on 23 September for training.

On 5 October, she escorted into New York and joined the screen for for nine days of exercises in shore bombardment and other drills before joining convoy UGS-21 which sailed from Norfolk, bound for North Africa. &quot;Thompson&quot; served as an escort, keeping ships in the channel as they plodded out to sea and prodding them to close up and keep in formation, while her echo-ranging gear was alert for prowling submarines off Chesapeake Bay. One day out, 16 October, (UGS.21 sailed from Hampton Roads on 5 November, and therefore I believe this to be 6 November) the wind and sea rose, presaging a heavy storm which served to scatter parts of the convoy and cause &quot;Thompson&quot; to note in her log numerous times, &quot;telling stragglers to close up.&quot; After the transatlantic voyage, &quot;Thompson&quot; was released from escort duty on 31 October, to proceed to Casablanca, French Morocco.

One week later, the destroyer, attached to DesDiv 36, was homeward-bound with Convoy GUS-20. On 24 November, &quot;Thompson&quot; entered New York harbor with the convoy and then proceeded independently to the New York Navy Yard for voyage repairs. She sailed for Casco Bay on 5 December, and conducted refresher training en route.

On 7 December, &quot;Thompson&quot; and screened as the battleship conducted high-speed runs and turning trials. Later that day, the three ships engaged in night illumination and spotting practice before carrying out the same program on 8 December.

After returning to Casco Bay, &quot;Thompson&quot; again put to sea, bound for Norfolk. During the night of 10 December, the winds increased to 70 knots (130 km/h) with high seas and a low barometer. By 07:35, it became necessary to rig in her already battered whaleboats and reduce speed to 12 knots (22 km/h).

&quot;Thompson&quot; put into Norfolk on 12 December. Two days later she joined Convoy UGS-27, bound for North Africa. On 27 December, she made a depth charge run on what her log termed &quot;a questionable target&quot;.

Entering Casablanca harbor on 3 January 1944, &quot;Thompson&quot; and her fellow escorts were soon assigned to Convoy GUS-27, bound for Norfolk, where they arrived on 24 January. After alternating between New York, Boston, and Casco Bay, she departed Norfolk on 18 March, bound for Trinidad.

=== Invasion of Normandy, April–July 1944 ===

Returning to Norfolk six days later, &quot;Thompson&quot; operated along the east coast until mid-April when she joined the build-up of forces for the invasion of western Europe. On 18 April, she rendezvoused with &quot;Baldwin&quot;, &quot;Arkansas&quot;, ,
, and the rest of Destroyer Squadron 18 (DesRon18) – to which &quot;Thompson&quot; was attached – and sailed for England. This force arrived at Plymouth, England, on 28 April, and prepared for duties during the forthcoming invasion.

On 4 May 1944, &quot;Thompson&quot; participated in landing exercise &quot;Fabius&quot;, one of the many preliminaries to the landing on Normandy. On 9 May, she conducted shore bombardment practice at Slapton Sands, England; on 13 May, she fired antiaircraft practice off Ailsa Craig, Scotland, and, on 16 May, she engaged in division tactics and further bombardment exercises off the Irish coast.

On 15 April, she anchored at Belfast Lough, Northern Ireland. The following day, 16 April, &quot;Nevada&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;, and Destroyer Division 36 (DesDiv 36) departed for exercises off the Irish coast before returning to Belfast Lough. Three days later, on 19 April, General Dwight D. Eisenhower inspected the ship. Underway on 20 April, she conducted anti-E-boat exercises through 22 April. In these operations, she fired star shells and practiced illumination tactics for dealing with the foreseen danger of &quot;Schnellbooten&quot;. After more shore bombardment practice, in which her five-inch and Bofors gunners exercised at their battle stations and sharpened up their gunnery, she put out of Belfast Lough for Plymouth and thence proceeded to the Isle of Portland, where she arrived on 27 April.

The next day, German Heinkel He 111s bombed and mined the harbor, causing no small amount of work for harried minesweeper crews. But, with this danger soon swept away, the Allied forces could resume the nearly complete preparations for the upcoming Normandy invasion.

On 5 June, she joined Task Group 124.7 (TG124.7), Convoy O-1, bound for Omaha Beach. She and her charges arrived off the Normandy beaches after an uneventful, but storm-tossed, evening. &quot;Thompson&quot; then received her fire support orders to take station off Pointe de la Percée as a unit of TG124.9. &quot;En route&quot;, she stood to action stations, her guns trained out and ready for any eventuality as the drama of history&#x27;s greatest landing operation unfolded around her.

She arrived off Pointe du Hoc as Army rangers were struggling to gain a foothold on the rocky promontory. &quot;Thompson&quot; spotters could not see much at that moment, as Army aerial bombardments had obscured the area with smoke and dust. But when the haze cleared away, the destroyer&#x27;s main battery opened fire with a vengeance, tongues of flame flashing from her gun muzzles as her salvos screamed shoreward. One by one, her targets of opportunity disappeared as her salvos struck &quot;on target.&quot; She then lay-to awaiting remaining enemy guns to reveal themselves with tell-tale flashes.

Later in the day, she cruised closer inshore and located three giant German Würzburg radar antennas. Once again, her spotting was deadly accurate, and one of the radar &quot;dishes&quot; toppled over, shattered by &quot;Thompson&quot; shells. Soon after, the wreckage of the two other antennas joined the first one in the dust.

&quot;Thompson&quot; smaller guns also got into the fray. Her 40 mm batteries shredded concealments of shore batteries and sniper nests, working in close conjunction with shore spotting teams who ferreted out the hidden enemy. Among her other targets was a fortified house. Solidly constructed, it had withstood numerous coastal storms. But on 6 June 1944, its solid Norman masonry could not hold up to a few rounds of five-inch (127 mm) high explosives; and down it tumbled, into a pile of rubble.

The following day, 7 June, &quot;Thompson&quot; gunners were at it again – this time, in support of the Rangers at Point du Hoc. Once more, her 40 mm and five-inch (127 mm) batteries shot the enemy out of his sniper nests and gun positions before setting course for Portland, to anchor in Weymouth Bay to replenish her depleted fuel and ammunition stocks.

On 8 June, &quot;Thompson&quot; and her companion &quot;Satterlee&quot; (DD-626) steamed back to Omaha beach. On the evening of 9 June, the Germans struck back in a stealthy E-boat attack. &quot;Thompson&quot;, screening as part of the Allied naval craft gathered there, joined in commencing fire on the intruders who were successfully driven off, retiring to the northward at high speed. On 10 June, her 20 mm and 40 mm gunners splashed a low-flying German &quot;snooper&quot; airplane.

At 01:00 on 11 June, another E-boat attack developed from the northward. Here, as before, the long hours spent in night illumination and spotting practice exercises paid off handsome dividends. &quot;Thompson&quot; fired star shells, which revealed the shadowy E-boats. British steam gun boats &quot;Grey Wolf&quot; (SGB-8) and &quot;Grey Goose&quot; (SGB-9) then darted in to ward off the intruders under the watchful eye of the destroyermen.

On 12 June, &quot;Thompson&quot; embarked a party (which included Admiral Ernest J. King and Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, and Henry H. Arnold) and transported them across the channel to the invasion beaches at Omaha and then returned to Plymouth with Admiral King and his party embarked. A motor launch with the officers mentioned above was launched to bring them in. An unknown ship was ahead of the motor launch and struck a mine.

&quot;Thompson&quot; continued to operate off Normandy beaches throughout the remainder of June 1944, steaming often between the Baie de la Seine, and Plymouth, England. On one occasion, she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, Naval Commander, Western Task Forces, for a quick visit to Cherbourg; on another, she once more served as a transport for General Eisenhower.

On 24 July 1944, &quot;Thompson&quot; steamed for North Africa, transiting the Straits of Gibraltar and arriving at Bizerte four days later. Underway in company with the rest of Destroyer Division 36 (DesDiv36) on the 29th, she left Bizerte bound for Oran, Algeria, arriving on 30 July. &quot;Thompson&quot; reached Naples on 6 August and joined the Allied expeditionary forces amassing for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. Underway with Convoy SF-1, bound for the assault area, &quot;Thompson&quot; served in the screen and patrolled offshore throughout the operation from 15 to 21 August.

After a brief tender availability from 28 August to 1 September, she returned to the southern France beachheads to continue patrols through 18 September before steaming to Mers-El-Kebir, Morocco, where she arrived four days later, on 22 September. On 23 September she departed Mers-El-Kebir and headed for the United States. Arriving at Bermuda on 1 October, she commenced Navy Yard availability on 3 October, which lasted through 27 October of that month. For the remainder of 1944, &quot;Thompson&quot; operated off the east coast of the United States.

On 3 January 1945, the destroyer joined Convoy UGS-86, bound for North African ports. Entering Mers-El-Kebir on 20 January, she remained in North African waters until 1 February, when she joined the screen of Convoy GUS-68, en route to the United States. Arriving off New York on 13 February, the New York section of the convoy was detached. &quot;Thompson&quot; continued on with the Boston section, where she commenced a 10-day availability at the Boston Navy Yard on 15 February.

Following these repairs, she steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, conducting gunnery exercises en route. On 1 March, she sortied with Convoy UGF-21, bound for North Africa, and arrived in North African waters on 12 March. The following month, after returning to the United States, she again escorted a North African convoy, this time UGS-85, commencing on 7 April.

On 30 May, &quot;Thompson&quot; was reclassified as a fast minesweeper and given hull classification symbol DMS-38. She spent the month of June undergoing conversion for her new mission, commencing on 5 June. She completed her yard work on 29 June. During a post-conversion period, she conducted her first minesweeping exercises, with magnetic sweep equipment, in Chesapeake Bay. She also calibrated her radar, conducted antiaircraft exercises, and practiced laying mines. On 1 August, she departed the Virginia Capes and steamed toward the Panama Canal Zone, where she arrived on 7 August. While underway on 14 August, she received the news Japan had surrendered. On 18 August, she arrived at San Diego.

==Post World War II==

During September, &quot;Thompson&quot; moved westward, stopping at Pearl Harbor on 8 September and Eniwetok on 21 September. Arriving at Buckner Bay on 28 September, she put in just in time to take on fuel and head out to sea as a typhoon swirled north. Shortly after the ship returned to Buckner Bay, yet another typhoon warning scrambled the Fleet and set it seaward into the East China Sea once more. On 9 October, the center of Typhoon Louise smashed through Okinawa, but &quot;Thompson&quot; was well-clear and suffered no damage. She and her sister-ships in Mine Division 61 (MineDiv 61), formed a scouting line four miles (6 km) apart on 10 October, keeping careful lookout while returning to Buckner Bay, searching for life rafts, derelicts, or men in the water.

On 16 October, &quot;Thompson&quot;, in company with MineDiv61, headed to sea from Buckner Bay to commence sweeping operations in area &quot;Rickshaw&quot; in the Yellow Sea. En route the following day, &quot;Thompson&quot; sighted several floating mines and destroyed them by gunfire.

On 19 October, the force arrived at &quot;Rickshaw,&quot; joined by &quot;PGM-29&quot;, &quot;PGM-30&quot;, and &quot;PGM-31&quot;. &quot;Thompson&quot; began her initial actual minesweeping at the northeast end of known mine lanes. The following day, &quot;Thompson&quot; swept her first mine – the first one swept by the task group. By 17 November, &quot;Rickshaw&quot; had been swept clean of Japanese mines, with &quot;Thompson&quot; scoring high with 64 mines located and destroyed.

After a short tender availability at Sasebo, Japan, the base of operations for MineDiv 61, &quot;Thompson&quot; steamed to Nagoya, Japan, to become flagship of the task group sweeping nearby waters. Completing this operation by mid-December, the minesweeper steamed back via Wakayama to Sasebo. During the last week in 1945, she assisted in the unsuccessful search for survivors of &quot;Minivet&quot; (AM-371), sunk by a mine explosion off Tsushima, northwest of Kyūshū, Japan.

The ship spent January and February 1946 in Japanese home waters, and then steamed for Bikini Atoll to assist in sweeping operations to prepare the area for Operation Crossroads tests of atomic bombs to be conducted there in July. Before the tests took place, &quot;Thompson&quot; headed back to the United States. She remained at San Francisco, through July and then spent two months in overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California. From Mare Island, she returned to San Francisco to operate out of that port until late in the year. After six months of operation at San Francisco, she sailed for China on 10 February 1947, and proceeded via Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Kwajalein to Tsingtao.

Following six months duty with American occupation forces in Chinese waters, &quot;Thompson&quot; returned to the United States in early September 1947 and arrived at San Diego, California, on 2 October. Transferred to the operational command of Destroyers, Pacific Fleet, with the abolition of the Pacific Fleet Minecraft command, &quot;Thompson&quot; operated out of San Diego as a destroyer until 29 April 1948, when she returned again to Mare Island for a two-month overhaul. In July, she returned to San Diego and underwent training operations off the west coast, activities in which she was engaged for the remainder of 1948.

In January 1949, &quot;Thompson&quot; again set course for China in company with Destroyer Division 52. En route, however, the ships received orders to put about for the west coast after spending a few days in Hawaii, arriving at San Diego on 4 February 1949.

&quot;Thompson&quot; and three of her sister fast-minesweepers then became Mine Squadron One (MineRon 1) and were assigned to the General Line School at Monterey, California. They alternated in these operations between Monterey and San Diego for the remainder of 1949. After spending the first three months of 1950 in routine exercises and cruises out of San Diego, &quot;Thompson&quot; steamed for Pearl Harbor on 6 April 1950, for a three-month overhaul.

==Korean War==

While in the yard, she received news that North Korean armed forces had invaded South Korea crossing the 38th parallel. Completing her overhaul ahead of schedule, &quot;Thompson&quot; returned to San Diego on 20 July and began an accelerated and rigorous underway training period which lasted through August and part of September 1950.

On 4 October 1950, &quot;Thompson&quot; and sister ship departed San Diego, and arrived at Pearl Harbor five days later. The next day, they got underway for Midway Atoll. Twenty-four hours from their destination, orders directed them to patrol off Wake Island during the meeting of General Douglas MacArthur and President Harry Truman. &quot;Thompson&quot; remained there overnight, refueling at sea from before proceeding to Japan, arriving at Sasebo on 21 October.

While &quot;Thompson&quot; and &quot;Carmick&quot; had steamed across the Pacific, United Nations forces had been rallying after the initial heavy losses and retreats at the hands of the communist armies. Accordingly, the American Eighth Army put heavy pressure on North Korean troops, pushing them towards P&#x27;yŏngyang, on the west coast of Korea. This thrust was stretching the Army&#x27;s supply lanes. To remedy this problem, an operation was mounted to open up the mined port of Chinnampo, some 50 km southwest of P&#x27;yŏngyang, at the mouth of the Taedong River.

This required ingenuity and resourcefulness, not least because of a lack of minesweeping craft at the start of operations. &quot;Thompson&quot; and &quot;Carmick&quot;, newly arrived in the &quot;Land of the Morning Calm&quot;, were detailed to join the makeshift minesweeping organization recently established under Commander Stephen M. Archer.
Consisting of , , , , , and , Japanese LST &quot;Q-007&quot;,
four Republic of Korea minesweepers, and a helicopter from , this task group performed a nearly impossible feat in slightly over two weeks. Before too long, American ships were bringing in supplies to the advancing Eighth Army. After a week of patrol duties off the newly swept port escorting logistics ships now able to utilize the channel, &quot;Thompson&quot; left the bitterly cold region behind for a week of repairs and resupply at Sasebo.

In early November, however, the entry of Chinese communist forces into the war vastly altered the strategic picture. In the face of heavy onslaughts, United Nations troops retreated. One port which served as an evacuation point was Chinnampo, familiar to &quot;Thompson&quot; men as a result of the minesweeping operation conducted a scant month before.

While United Nations warships conducted bombardments of advancing communist troops, &quot;Thompson&quot; escorted troopships out of the harbor in dense fog and through treacherous tidal currents to assist in the evacuation. For her part in this action, &quot;Thompson&quot; received the Navy Unit Commendation.

After replenishment, she served as harbor control vessel at Incheon, Korea. Two days after Christmas, she suddenly received orders to head for Sasebo, where MineRon 1 was to be regrouped. Arriving at the Japanese port on 27 December, she departed on 30 December 1950, in company with and for minesweeping assignments on the east coast of Korea. There, she spent close to three weeks engaged in clearance sweeps so that support ships could take fire-support stations to assist ground forces ashore.

In late January 1951, after a month in the arduous and cold conditions of that region, &quot;Thompson&quot; returned to Sasebo for repairs. These included drydocking for work on the hull, and, as a result of the docking period, the availability was extended another three weeks, before she departed for minesweeping operations again in mid-February.

Using Wonsan as a base, she operated to the northward, eventually sweeping Kyoto Wan deep, south of the Manchurian border. While sweeping off the key railway nexus of Sŏngjin, &quot;Thompson&quot; ran across a new minefield and cut seven mines as she passed through on her sweep. Later, she operated in the screen for and , while they operated in that area on shore bombardment duties.

At Chuuron Jang, she herself destroyed two railroad bridges with her pinpoint gunnery. Also during this period, she took part in &quot;junk-busting&quot; operations up and down the coast, being on the lookout for suspicious junks used by communist forces for infiltration and minelaying operations. On one occasion, while underway north of Sŏngjin, she sighted six North Korean junks in a cove. Once again, as at the Normandy &quot;D-day&quot; landings, &quot;Thompson&quot; gunners opened fire with a vengeance and sank all six communist boats.

After a month of such operations, she returned to Sasebo for upkeep. From 1 April 1951 to 3 November, &quot;Thompson&quot; returned to shell communist defense positions, supply lines, and troop concentrations. On 14 June, however, it was the enemy&#x27;s turn to hit back. &quot;Thompson&quot; gunners had just completed the destruction of a railroad bridge near Sŏngjin when communist shore batteries opened fire, soon straddling the ship. One shell struck the bridge and knocked out the ship&#x27;s fire control gear. In retaliation, &quot;Thompson&quot; gunners destroyed one enemy battery and damaged another. With three dead and three wounded, &quot;Thompson&quot; retired.

On 3 November 1951, &quot;Thompson&quot; departed from Korean waters, homeward bound. She steamed into San Diego Bay on 20 November and thence proceeded to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul. After post-repair trials, she conducted operations on the west coast and underwent a restricted availability at Long Beach, California. &quot;Thompson&quot; spent the remainder of 1951 and the first part of 1952 in continental United States waters before departing San Diego on 23 June 1952.

Arriving at Pearl Harbor six days later, she continued on to Yokosuka, where she arrived on 18 July. After a short availability alongside destroyer tender , &quot;Thompson&quot; proceeded to Sŏngjin, arriving off that port on 11 August 1952.

In contrast to her earlier Korean tours, when her minesweeping duties were intermingled with destroyer-type operations, &quot;Thompson&quot; was now free to operate as a destroyer for coast patrol and gunfire support duties. Sweeping was now done by AMs and AMSs and was all done at night.

The communists, too, had changed tactics. More guns were brought in to defend the coasts, while enemy accuracy had improved as well. On 20 August 1952, once more off Sŏngjin, &quot;Thompson&quot; was taken under fire by a Chinese battery. A shell hit the flying bridge, killing four and wounding nine. &quot;Thompson&quot; attempted to return the fire, but the excellently concealed shore guns made the return shelling&#x27;s accuracy difficult and ineffective. Retiring from the scene, the stricken &quot;Thompson&quot; transferred her casualties to , then operating 16 miles (30 km) south of Sŏngjin.

Five days later, the minesweeper arrived at Sasebo on 26 August for tender availability, repairing her engines and battle damage, before she headed north to Sŏngjin. She remained off this unlucky port from 13 September to 12 October 1952, occasionally patrolling to the northernmost extremity of the United Nations blockade before again returning to Sasebo.

From 3 November to 1 December 1952, &quot;Thompson&quot; operated in Wonsan harbor, as part of the United Nations blockade forces there. As such, she was in range of communist guns on many occasions. The object of enemy fire at least four times, &quot;Thompson&quot; received damage for the third time when straddled on 20 November 1952, while acting as gunfire support ship for which was conducting a sweep of the inner harbor. From three widely spaced points enemy guns took the minesweepers under fire, catching &quot;Thompson&quot; amidships on the starboard side as she was laying clouds of oily black smoke between &quot;Kite&quot; and the shoreline.

Returning to Yokosuka for repairs to the battle damage, &quot;Thompson&quot; spent Christmas in that Japanese naval port. New Year&#x27;s, however, once again found the fast minesweeper at Sŏngjin. After two more tours there, into February 1953, &quot;Thompson&quot; headed back to the United States in company with &quot;Carmick&quot;. With refueling stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, she finally arrived at San Diego on 14 March 1953.

==Post Korean War==

Operating with MineDiv 11, &quot;Thompson&quot; was based on the west coast for the remainder of the year. Beginning on 8 June 1953, she played the title role in Columbia Pictures&#x27;s &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot;, the 1954 film adaptation of the Herman Wouk novel of the same name. Operating out of San Francisco for one week, &quot;Thompson&quot; became the &quot;Caine&quot;, while serving as the model for many of the Columbia sets used in the filming of the on-board scenes.

After taking part in two exercises in late September 1953, she operated out of San Diego until 1 December 1953, when she reported to the Pacific Reserve Fleet to prepare for inactivation. On 18 May 1954, &quot;Thompson&quot; commission pennant was hauled down and the ship placed in reserve. On 16 July 1956, she was reclassified as a destroyer and redesignated DD-627.

She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1971, and sold to the American Ship Dismantlers of Portland, Oregon, on 7 August 1972, for scrapping.

<text>Bobbie Gentry (born Roberta Lee Streeter; July 27, 1942) is an American retired singer-songwriter. She was one of the first female artists in America to compose and produce her own material.

Gentry rose to international fame in 1967 with her Southern Gothic narrative &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;. The track spent four weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and was third in the Billboard year-end chart of 1967, earning Gentry Grammy awards for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance in 1968.

Gentry charted 11 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and four singles on the United Kingdom Top 40. Her album &quot;Fancy&quot; brought her a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. After her first albums, she had a successful run of variety shows on the Las Vegas Strip. In the late 1970s, Gentry lost interest in performing, and retired from the music industry. News reports conflict on the subject of where she lives.

== Early life ==
Gentry was born Roberta Lee Streeter on July 27, 1942, near Woodland in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, to Ruby Lee (née Shipman; November 28, 1920 – April 2, 1989) and Robert Harrison Streeter. When her parents divorced shortly after her birth, her mother moved to California, leaving Gentry to be raised on a farm by her paternal grandparents. She grew up without electricity or plumbing. Her grandmother traded one of the family&#x27;s milk cows for a neighbor&#x27;s piano, and, at age seven, Gentry composed her first song, &quot;My Dog Sergeant Is a Good Dog&quot;. Gentry lived in Greenwood, Mississippi, with her father for a few years and learned to play the guitar and banjo.

At age 13, Gentry moved to Palm Springs, California, to live with her then-remarried mother. They performed as a duo, Ruby and Bobbie Meyers, for a short time. Gentry took her stage name from the 1952 film &quot;Ruby Gentry,&quot; which she had seen on television. In the film, Ruby (played by Jennifer Jones) was a poor but beautiful girl from the backwoods, who ended up marrying the town tycoon.

After graduating from high school, Gentry moved to Los Angeles to enter UCLA as a philosophy major. She supported herself with clerical jobs, occasionally performing at nightclubs and country clubs, and when she appeared in a revue at Les Folies Bergeres nightclub in Las Vegas, Bob Hope encouraged her to keep performing. She worked as a fashion model, and on June 29, 1962, United Press International circulated a wire photo of Gentry that included Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana Turner. Gentry transferred to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music, where she took classes in composition, music theory and arranging. While attending a Jody Reynolds concert at a club in Palm Springs in 1966, Gentry asked if she could sit in on one of Reynolds&#x27; recording sessions. This led to an invitation to sing on two duets with Reynolds: &quot;Stranger in the Mirror&quot; and &quot;Requiem for Love&quot;. The two songs were released in September 1966 by Titan Records, but failed to chart.

==Career==
===1967: Debut===
Gentry recorded a demo at Whitney Recording Studio in Glendale, California, in February and March 1967. Her sole ambition originally was to write songs to sell to other artists, telling &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that she only sang on the recording of &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; that she took to Capitol because it was cheaper than hiring someone to sing it.

Gentry signed with Capitol Records on June 23, 1967, where staff producer Kelly Gordon would produce &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; as his first full-length album for the label. But it was &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot;, intended as the A-side of her first single, that initially got Gentry signed. Her original demo of &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot; was the version issued, but &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; acquired a string arrangement by Jimmie Haskell, dubbed onto the original recording at Capitol. The day after the string session, Capitol&#x27;s A&amp;R team decided to make &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; the A-side. The single was released on July 10, 1967. It would spend four weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and, on the year-end chart, place number three. The single reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Singles chart and number 13 on the UK Top 40. It sold more than 3,000,000 copies worldwide. In 2001, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine listed &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; among &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

Following the single&#x27;s success, the producers quickly assembled the rest of the album from the 12 demos Gentry had recorded, completing overdubs in a matter of days. The result was a unique combination of blues, folk, and jazz elements that rounded out Gentry&#x27;s recollections of her home, coming across more as a concept album than a hastily assembled collection of songs. Capitol pre-ordered 500,000 copies—the largest pressing of a debut album in the label&#x27;s prior history. The album hit stores within a month of pressing, on August 21. &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; replaced the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Black Albums chart. Gentry won three Grammy Awards in 1967, including &quot;Best New Artist&quot; and &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&quot;. She was also named the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s Most Promising Female Vocalist.

===1968: &quot;The Delta Sweete&quot;, &quot;Local Gentry&quot; and Glen Campbell===
In February 1968, Gentry took part in the Italian Song Festival in Sanremo competition, as one of two performers of &quot;La Siepe&quot; by Vito Pallavicini and Massara. Capitol released the song concurrently as a single, backed by another Italian tune also recorded by Gentry, &quot;La Città è Grande&quot; by Pallavicini and De Ponti.
Gentry&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Delta Sweete&quot;, was released in February 1968. In its musical ambition, the album represented a decisive step beyond her debut. This concept album drew inspiration from Gentry&#x27;s Mississippi Delta roots. Most of its sound comes from Gentry, who played almost every instrument on its tracks, including piano, guitar, banjo, bass, and vibes. Nonetheless, Capitol&#x27;s Kelly Gordon, producer of Gentry&#x27;s first work for the label, also received the entire producing credit for &quot;The Delta Sweete.&quot; The album earned Gentry two more entries on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Okolona River Bottom Band&quot; peaked at number 54, while her cover of &quot;Louisiana Man&quot; made it to number 100. Although the album failed to match the success of its predecessor, only reaching number 132 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, critics have called it one of the unacclaimed masterpieces of the 1960s.

Following &quot;The Delta Sweete&quot;, Capitol released Gentry&#x27;s third album, &quot;Local Gentry&quot;, in August 1968. It failed to appear on any of the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, but did peak at number 83 on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; Top 100 Albums chart.

In September, one month after the release of &quot;Local Gentry,&quot; the artist&#x27;s third album of 1968 came out. &quot;Bobbie Gentry and Glen Campbell&quot; features duets with label mate Glen Campbell. Their chemistry made the partnership a great success. The album peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LP&#x27;s chart and number one on the Top Country LP&#x27;s chart. It was also certified Gold by the RIAA and earned Gentry and Campbell the Academy of Country Music award for Album of the Year. Gentry was also nominated for Top Female Vocalist.

===&quot;Bobbie Gentry&quot; (TV series)===
In 1968, Gentry was invited to host her own variety show on BBC Two in the UK, making her the first female songwriter to front a series on the channel. The initial six episodes of &quot;Bobbie Gentry&quot; were broadcast weekly from July 13 to August 17, 1968. It featured musicians from the Mississippi countryside, as well as guests such as Donovan, the Hollies, Glen Campbell, James Taylor, Randy Newman, Elton John, Alan Price, Billy Preston, and Pan&#x27;s People. Two further, six-episode series were broadcast from June 18 to July 23, 1969; and February 1 to March 15, 1971.

The series was produced and directed by Stanley Dorfman, who was engaged to be married to Gentry in 1970, and credited Gentry as his co-director. Dorfman told author Tara Murtha, &quot;After a few episodes, she was pretty much co-directing the show because she had such great ideas. [But] the BBC wouldn&#x27;t have it, wouldn&#x27;t have an artist credited as a director or producer, so the credit went to me as producer and director. But she definitely contributed as much as I did creatively to the show. She was just full of ideas.&quot; John Cameron, the Music Arranger for her BBC shows noted, &quot;She was pretty much the alpha female in the group – [producer] Stanley Dorfman&#x27;s assistant Kate and choreographer Flick Colby were the only other prominent females in the crew. She certainly didn&#x27;t have a support group like Dusty [Springfield]. &quot;The series garnered widespread recognition and was syndicated globally.

All but five of the 18 episodes were wiped by the BBC and those surviving were rebroadcast for the first time in November 2023 on BBC Four.

From 1968 to 1971, while in the UK recording her own series, Gentry also made numerous guest appearances on other BBC shows. These included a one-hour special for the &quot;In Concert&quot; series, broadcast on October 30, 1970; and Glen Campbell&#x27;s own BBC Two special, broadcast May 6, 1970.

===1969: &quot;Touch &#x27;Em with Love&quot;===
Gentry&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Touch &#x27;Em with Love&quot;, came out in July 1969. It marked a transition in her career: In an attempt to re-brand Gentry as a blue-eyed soul singer, it featured fewer self-penned regional songs and more systematically chosen cover songs. Recorded in Nashville and produced by Kelso Herston, the album&#x27;s 10 tracks included only two originals. The title track was released as the first single, but it failed to go above number 113 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart and only reached number 164 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Gentry&#x27;s cover of &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot; was released as the second single in the UK, where it became a number one hit on the UK Singles Chart. The album reached number 21 on the UK Albums Chart.

In 1969, Gentry taped four television specials for Canadian television station CFTO-TV Toronto for North American syndication.

===1970: &quot;Fancy&quot;===
April 1970 saw the release of &quot;Fancy&quot;, Gentry&#x27;s sixth album in three years. Like 1969&#x27;s &quot;Touch &#x27;Em with Love&quot;, it contains only covers, except for the artist&#x27;s self-penned title track. Most of the album was recorded at Fame Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, with producer Rick Hall. &quot;Fancy&quot;, released as the album&#x27;s first single, became Gentry&#x27;s biggest hit since &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;, peaking within the top 40 in the US, Canada, and Australia. Of the song Gentry herself said, &quot;Fancy is my strongest statement for women&#x27;s lib, if you really listen to it. I agree wholeheartedly with that movement and all the serious issues that [it stands] for—equality, equal pay, day care centers, and abortion rights,&quot; she explained to &quot;After Dark&quot; magazine in 1974.

The album&#x27;s first European single, a cover of &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head&quot;, peaked at number 40. The album&#x27;s second North American single, &quot;He Made a Woman Out of Me&quot;, did not reach the same heights as &quot;Fancy&quot;, reaching only number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Gentry would be nominated for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Female at the 13th Annual Grammy Awards.

===1971–1974: &quot;Patchwork&quot; and departure from Capitol===
Gentry released &quot;Patchwork&quot; in April 1971. It has been described as a collection of short stories in song, ranging from country and pop to blues, stitched together with cinematic interludes to form a cohesive whole. &quot;Patchwork&quot; was Gentry&#x27;s first entirely self-written and -produced album. Its first single: &quot;But I Can&#x27;t Get Back&quot;, was a small hit, peaking at number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Easy Listening chart and number 93 in Canada. Gentry would release one more single for Capitol in August 1972, &quot;The Girl from Cincinnati&quot;.

Around the time &quot;Patchwork&quot; was released, the entire executive board that had been at Capitol throughout Gentry&#x27;s career was fired. A major restructuring at Capitol took place as parent company EMI tried to seize back control and rekindle the label&#x27;s dwindling profits. This saw the artist roster slashed from 247 to 81 alongside extensive cuts to production and marketing budgets. With none of the executive board left that had known and worked with her, negotiations stalled over the renewal terms of Gentry&#x27;s contract, and this failure to reach an agreement with Capitol created a stalemate. Since Gentry was unwilling to release an album with Capitol on the terms offered, she found herself unable to release an album on another label, meaning she was left with no choice but to wait out the remaining option period of her contract.

In 1974, she hosted a summer replacement variety show on CBS called &quot;The Bobbie Gentry Happiness Hour&quot;. The show, which was her version of Glen Campbell&#x27;s hit series &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, was not renewed for a full season.

===1975–1977: Post-Capitol recordings===
In 1975, Gentry wrote and performed &quot;Another Place, Another Time&quot; for writer-director Max Baer, Jr.&#x27;s film &quot;Macon County Line&quot;. Following the film&#x27;s success the song was released on a promotional 7-inch single. In 1976, Baer directed the feature film &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot;, based on Gentry&#x27;s hit song and starring Robby Benson and Glynnis O&#x27;Connor. In the movie, the mystery of the title character&#x27;s suicide is revealed as a part of the conflict between his love for Bobbie Lee Hartley and a drunken homosexual experience. Warner Bros. Records released a soundtrack of the score by Michel Legrand, including a re-recorded version of &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;, re-titled &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot; to match the film&#x27;s title, with Gentry stating that the original spelling was an error. Warner Bros. released the new version as a single and Capitol re-released the original version, which gave Gentry two concurrent chart placings with the same song. The re-recording would go on to be Gentry&#x27;s last single to chart, meaning that her first and last chart entries are the same song.

In 1977 Gentry reunited with producer Rick Hall in Muscle Shoals to record an album for the Curb Records division of Warner Bros. Records (unlike Gentry&#x27;s 1969 &quot;Fancy&quot; album, Gentry&#x27;s 1977 recording sessions with Hall were not at his FAME Studios but at the nearby Music Mill Studio). After an advance single: &quot;Steal Away&quot;, had an unsuccessful February 1978 release, the album was shelved. &quot;Steal Away&quot; - a remake of the 1964 Jimmy Hughes hit which had inaugurated FAME Studios&#x27; hit streak - had as its B-side: the Patti Dahlstrom composition &quot;He Did Me Wrong, But He Did It Right&quot;: these tracks plus three additional tracks from Gentry&#x27;s 1977 recording sessions: &quot;Slow Cookin&#x27;&quot; (written by Abby Marable), &quot;Sweet Country&quot; (written by Gentry), and &quot;Thunder in the Afternoon&quot; (written by Mac Davis, Rita Grimm and Yvonne Norman), would be released on the 1992 European compilation album &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot;.

===1978–1982: Final projects before retirement===
Gentry appeared as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on Christmas Day 1978. She attended the Best of Vegas Awards on March 21, 1980.

On May 10, 1981, Gentry was one of many celebrity guests to take part in &quot;An All-Star Salute to Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;. During the television special she performed &quot;Mama, a Rainbow&quot; from the musical &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Boys&quot; for her mother who was seated in the audience. This would prove to be Gentry&#x27;s final public performance.

The last time Gentry appeared in public was when she attended the Academy of Country Music Awards on April 30, 1982. Since that time, she has not recorded, performed or been interviewed. One 2016 news report stated that Gentry lived in a gated community near Memphis, Tennessee. According to another report the same year, Gentry lived in a gated community in Los Angeles.

<doc id="186330" wikidata="Q760113" url="?curid=186330" title="Sumptuary law">
<text>Sumptuary laws (from Latin ) are laws that try to regulate consumption. &quot;Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary&quot; defines them as &quot;Laws made for the purpose of restraining luxury or extravagance, particularly against inordinate expenditures for apparel, food, furniture, or shoes, etc.&quot; Historically, they were intended to regulate and reinforce social hierarchies and morals through restrictions on clothing, food, and luxury expenditures, often depending on a person&#x27;s social rank.

Societies have used sumptuary laws for a variety of purposes. They were used to try to regulate the balance of trade by limiting the market for expensive imported goods. They made it easy to identify social rank and privilege, and as such could be used for social discrimination and to stabilize social hierarchies. They could also be used to prevent, or at least reduce opportunities for political bribery and corruption.

The laws often prevented commoners from imitating the appearance of aristocrats, and could be used to stigmatize disfavoured groups. In Late Medieval cities, sumptuary laws were instituted as a way for the nobility to limit the conspicuous consumption of the prosperous bourgeoisie. Bourgeois subjects appearing to be as wealthy as or wealthier than the ruling nobility could undermine the nobility&#x27;s presentation of themselves as powerful, legitimate rulers. This could call into question their ability to control and defend their fief, thus inspiring traitors and rebels. Such laws continued to be used for these purposes well into the 17th century.

According to historian Lorraine Daston, sumptuary laws &quot;furnish the historian of rules with an extreme case of rule failure,&quot; as such laws frequently failed to reduce excess and may even have exacerbated excess. Sumptuary laws were often revisable regulations rather than stable laws, as governing authorities sought to prohibit the latest rebellious or extravagant fashions.

==Classical world==
===Ancient Greece===
The seventh-century BC law-text of Locrians by Zaleucus, the first written &#x27;law code&#x27; in ancient Greece, stipulated:

It also banned the drinking of undiluted wine except for medical purposes.

===Ancient Rome===
The of ancient Rome were various laws passed to prevent inordinate expense (Latin ) in banquets and dress, such as the use of expensive Tyrian purple dye. Roman senators and senior magistrates were entitled to wear a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga and tunic. In the early years of the Roman Empire, men were forbidden to wear silk, which was deemed an effeminate and morally suspect material. During the height of the Empire, expenditure on silk imported from China was so high that imperial advisers warned that Roman silver reserves were becoming exhausted.

The Roman censors had a duty to put a check upon morals and extravagance in personal and political expenditure. The censors published details of offences in the , which listed the names of everyone found guilty of a luxurious mode of living; a great many instances of this kind are recorded. Towards the end of the Roman Republic, laws were passed against political corruption of Roman magistrates, forbidding their attendance at banquets given by candidates or their agents. During the period of transition from Republic to Empire, such antisumptuary laws, which may have still existed were virtually ignored by most. In the period of profligate luxury goods that characterized the height of the Roman Empire, the laws regarding the wearing of Tyrian purple were rigorously enforced. Infringement of this prohibition was treasonous, so punishable by death.

Roman sumptuary laws applied to both the living and the dead. Rome&#x27;s most ancient laws, the laws of the Twelve Tables, forbade extravagant expenses at funerals. This included the pouring of wine over the ashes at cremations (which seems nevertheless to have been an invariable practise), the use of smoothed timbers in funeral pyres, and &quot;excessive&quot; mourning.

==East Asia==
===China===
Sumptuary laws existed in China in one form or another from the Qin dynasty onward (221 BC). The Confucian virtue of restraint was embodied in the scholarly system central to China&#x27;s bureaucracy and became encoded in its laws.

Some laws concerned the size and decoration of graves and mausoleums. The Hongwu Emperor, founder of the Ming dynasty, issued such regulations in the first year of his rule (1368) and tightened them in 1396, allowing only the highest nobility and officials of the top three ranks a memorial stele installed on top of a stone tortoise; the steles of lower-level mandarins were perched on rectangular pedestals, while commoners had to be satisfied with a simple gravestone. The location of graves and the number of attendant statues depended on rank.

After , sumptuary law in China was reformed. It had long been ineffective. The consumption of luxuries had risen over the previous several centuries, and at the time of the Industrial Revolution in Europe, Chinese consumption of luxuries such as tea, sugar, fine silk, tobacco, and eating utensils was on a par with the core regions of Europe.

===Japan===

According to &quot;Britannica Online&quot;, &quot;In feudal Japan, sumptuary laws were passed with a frequency and minuteness of scope that had no parallel in the history of the Western world.&quot; During the Edo period (1603–1868), people of every class were subject to strict sumptuary laws, including regulation of the types of clothing that could be worn. In the second half of that period (the 18th and 19th centuries), the merchant class had grown far wealthier than the aristocratic samurai, and these laws sought to maintain the superiority of the samurai class despite the merchants being able to afford far more luxurious clothing and other items. The shogunate eventually gave in and allowed certain concessions, including allowing merchants of a certain prestige to wear a single sword at their belt; samurai were required to wear a matched pair when on official duty.

==Islamic world==
Islamic sumptuary laws are based upon teachings found in the Quran and Hadith. Males are exhorted not to wear silk clothes, nor have jewelry made of gold. Likewise, wearing clothes or robes that drag on the ground, seen as a sign of vanity and excessive pride, is also forbidden. These rules do not apply to women, who are allowed all this, but also need to cover their bodies and hair.

Prohibition of depictions of human and animal figures in general are similar to those of the Quranic prohibition on graven images. Hadiths do allow the depiction of animals on clothing items.

==Medieval and Renaissance Europe==
Sumptuary laws issued by secular authorities, aimed at keeping the main population dressed according to their &quot;station&quot;, do not begin until the later 13th century. These laws were addressed to the entire social body, but the brunt of regulations was directed at women and the middle classes. Their curbing of display was ordinarily couched in religious and moralizing vocabulary, yet was affected by social and economic considerations aimed at preventing ruinous expense among the wealthy classes and the drain of capital reserves to foreign suppliers.

===Courtesans===
Special forms of dress for prostitutes and courtesans were introduced during the 13th century – in Marseille, a striped cloak, in England a striped hood, and so on. Over time, these tended to be reduced to distinctive bands of fabric attached to the arm or shoulder, or tassels on the arm. Later restrictions specified various forms of finery that were forbidden, although there was also sometimes a recognition that finery represented working equipment (and capital) for a prostitute, and they could be exempted from laws applying to other non-noble women. By the 15th century, no compulsory clothing seems to have been imposed on prostitutes in Florence, Venice, or Paris.

===England===
As early as the 12th century, certain articles of clothing were prohibited to crusaders and pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land under the Saladin Tithe of 1188, but scant evidence exists in the historical record of legal regulations on dress in Britain until the reign of Edward III, during which prohibitions were enacted on the import of textiles from lands outside Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales and the exportation of domestically produced wool was likewise banned. The statute contained further restrictions on clothing based on social class; the earliest example of class-based restriction was that of fur, prohibited for anyone below the rank of lady or knight. The restriction on fur was expanded in subsequent decades in London to restrict prostitutes from wearing any furs, including &quot;budge&quot; (low-quality wool) or lambswool.

In England, which in this respect was typical of Europe, from the reign of Edward III in the Middle Ages until well into the 17th century, sumptuary laws dictated what colour and type of clothing, furs, fabrics, and trims were allowed to persons of various ranks or incomes. In the case of clothing, this was intended, amongst other reasons, to reduce spending on foreign textiles and to ensure that people did not dress &quot;above their station&quot;:

The first major sumptuary act was passed in April 1463 during the reign of Edward IV. Earlier statutes had sought to control the expense of household liveries, but the April 1463 statute marked the first attempt at a comprehensive sumptuary legislation. Scholars have interpreted the act as part of a set of protectionist economic measures that included regulations of the textile industry and trade in cloths. This statute is the first known English legislation restricting the use of &quot;royal purple&quot; – a term which, during the Middle Ages, referred not only to the Tyrian purple of Antiquity, but also to crimson, dark reds and royal blue. The language of the act uses technical terminology to restrict certain features of garments that are decorative in function, intended to enhance the silhouette.

A second &quot;Act of Apparel&quot; followed in January 1483 restricting cloth-of-gold, sable, ermine, velvet on velvet and satin brocade to knights and lords. Damask and satin were allowed for yeoman of the Crown and esquires and other members of the gentry, only if they had a yearly income of £40. Bustian, fustian, scarlet-dyed cloths and any leathers or animal hides other than lambskins were also restricted.

An act of Parliament, the Caps Act 1571 (13 Eliz. 1. c. 19) to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade decreed that on Sundays and holidays, all males over six years of age, except for the nobility and persons of degree, were to wear woolen caps on pain of a fine of three farthings ( penny) per day. This law instituted the flat cap as part of English wear. The 1571 act was repealed in 1597 by the Continuance, etc. of Laws Act 1597 (39 Eliz. 1. c. 18).

An extremely long list of items, specifying colour, materials, and sometimes place of manufacture (imported goods being much more tightly restricted) followed for each sex, with equally specific exceptions by rank of nobility or position held. For the most part, these laws seem to have had little effect, though the Parliament of England made repeated amendments to the laws, and several monarchs, most notably the Tudors, continually called for stricter enforcement, especially at Court &quot;to the intent there may be a difference of estates known by their apparel after the commendable custom in times past.&quot;

The laws were justified by the reasoning that the price of certain goods increased to levels where &quot;the treasure of the land is destroyed, to the great damage of the lords and the commonality&quot; when &quot;various people or various conditions wear various apparel not appropriate to their estate&quot;.

Adam Smith was against the necessity or convenience of sumptuary laws, he wrote: &quot;of It is the highest impertinence and presumption... in kings and ministers, to pretend to watch over the economy of private people, and to restrain their expense... They are themselves always, and without any exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society. Let them look well after their own expense, and they may safely trust private people with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the state, that of their subjects never will.&quot;

===Italy===
During the medieval and Renaissance eras in Italy, various towns passed sumptuary laws () often in response to particular events or movements. For example, Bernardino of Siena, in his public sermons in Siena, thundered against the vanity of luxurious dress; this, however, was counterbalanced by the economic benefit Siena derived as a manufacturer of items, including clothes, of luxury. One source describes these types of laws as constantly published, and generally ignored. These laws, mostly aimed at female apparel, sometimes became a source of revenue for the state: the Florentine laws of 1415 restricted the luxury that could be worn by women, but exempted those willing to pay 50 florins a year. The laws were often quite specific. Low necklines were prohibited in Genoa, Milan, and Rome in the early 16th century, and laws restricting zibellini (sable furs carried as fashion accessories) with heads and feet of precious metals and jewels were
issued in Bologna in 1545 and Milan in 1565.

===France===
Montaigne&#x27;s brief essay &quot;On sumptuary laws&quot; criticized 16th-century French laws, beginning: 

He also cites Plato and Zaleucus.

===Scotland===

One of the earliest known Scottish sumptuary regulations was passed in 1429 during the reign of James I of Scotland. The text, written in Old Scots, preserves some medieval legal terminology related to textiles, limiting silk, some types of furs (pine martens, beech martens) and other items to men of certain social ranks like knight, lord, burgess, and their families. As with the laws of Henry V of England in 1420, silver plating was reserved for the spurs of knights and the apparel of barons or higher ranking persons. Metalsmiths caught violating these laws would be punished by death and all their lands and goods forfeit. Embroidery and pearls were also restricted. Yeomen and commoners could not wear colored clothes longer than the knee. The poke sleeve that narrowed at the wrist were allowed for sentinel yeomen who lived in their lord&#x27;s house and rode with the gentlemen. Commoners&#x27; wives could not wear long-tail hoods or side-necked hoods, poked sleeves, or caps made from rich textiles like Lawn cloth or Rheims (fine linen).

The Dress Act 1746, which formed part of the Act of Proscription issued under George II following the Jacobite rising of 1745, made the wearing of Highland dress, including tartan and kilts, illegal in Scotland (an exemption was made for soldiers and veterans). The act, which was poorly enforced, was eventually repealed in 1782, and during the Regency and Victorian eras Highland dress gained widespread popularity in part thanks to the visit of George IV to Scotland in 1822, which was organised by Scottish writer Walter Scott.

==Early modern era==
Sumptuary laws were repealed in the early 17th century, but new protectionist laws were passed prohibiting the purchase of foreign silks and laces. Prohibitions were tied to rank and income and continued to be widely ignored.

===Ireland===

During the late 16th century, John Perrot, the Lord Deputy of Ireland under Elizabeth I, banned the wearing of traditional woollen mantles, &quot;open smocks&quot; with &quot;great sleeves&quot;, and native headdresses, requiring the people to dress in &quot;civil garments&quot; in the English style.

===France===
In 1629 and 1633, Louis XIII of France issued edicts regulating &quot;Superfluity of Dress&quot; that prohibited anyone but princes and the nobility from wearing gold embroidery or caps, shirts, collars, and cuffs embroidered with metallic threads or lace, and puffs, slashes, and bunches of ribbon were severely restricted. As with other such laws, these were widely disregarded and enforced in a lax manner. A series of popular engravings by Abraham Bosse depicts the supposed effects of this law.

===Colonial America===

In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a 1634 prohibition deemed that only people with a personal fortune of at least two hundred pounds could wear lace, silver or gold thread or buttons, cutwork, embroidery, hatbands, belts, ruffles, capes, and other articles. After a few decades, the law was being widely defied. By 1651, flouting of the rules caused leadership to issue a new strongly worded regulation to the populace again. In the Province of South Carolina, the 1712 slave code forbade slaves in the colony to wear clothes finer than &quot;Negro cloth&quot;.

==Modern era==
While rarely do restrictions exist on the type or quality of clothing, beyond maintenance of public decency, wearing certain types of clothing is restricted to specific occupations, specifically the uniforms of organisations like the police and military.

In some jurisdictions, clothing or other visible signs of religious or political opinion (e.g. Nazi imagery in Germany) are forbidden in certain public places.

Many American states in the 20th century prohibited the wearing of Ku Klux Klan hoods, masks, masquerade, or drag; gay men in New York City seized on the exemption for masquerade balls in the 1920s to 1930s to go in drag.

In Bhutan, the wearing of traditional dress (which also has an ethnic connotation) in certain places, such as when visiting government offices, was made compulsory in 1989 under the &quot;driglam namzha&quot; laws. Part of the traditional dress includes the kabney, a long scarf whose coloring is regulated. Only the King of Bhutan and Chief Abbot may don the saffron scarf, with various other colors reserved for government and religious officers, and white available for common people.

==Pejorative uses of term==
The term &quot;sumptuary law&quot; has been used as a pejorative term to describe any governmental control of consumption based on moral, religious, health, or public safety, or other concerns. American Judge Thomas M. Cooley generally described their modern form as laws that &quot;substitute the legislative judgment for that of the proprietor, regarding the manner in which he should use and employ his property.&quot; Policies to which the term has been critically applied include alcohol prohibition, drug prohibition, smoking bans, and restrictions on dog fighting.

===Alcohol prohibition===

As early as 1860, Anthony Trollope, writing about his experiences in Maine under the state&#x27;s prohibition law, stated, &quot;This law (prohibition), like all sumptuary laws, must fail.&quot; In 1918, William Howard Taft decried prohibition in the United States as a bad sumptuary law, stating that one of his reasons for opposing prohibition was his belief that &quot;sumptuary laws are matters for parochial adjustment.&quot; Taft later repeated this concern. The Indiana Supreme Court also discussed alcohol prohibition as a sumptuary law in its 1855 decision &quot;Herman v. State&quot;. During state conventions on the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1933, numerous delegates throughout the United States decried prohibition as having been an improper sumptuary law that never should have been included in the Constitution of the United States.

In 1971, a United States federal study stated that federal laws on alcohol include &quot;sumptuary laws which are directed at the purchaser&quot;, including, &quot;Sales are not permitted to minors or intoxicated persons. Credit is often prohibited on liquor sales, as well. Criminal penalties may be imposed for driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as for drunken behavior.&quot;

===Drug prohibition===

When the U.S. state of Washington considered cannabis decriminalization in two initiatives, 229 and 248, the initiatives&#x27; language stated, &quot;Cannabis prohibition is a sumptuary law of a nature repugnant to our Constitution&#x27;s framers.&quot;

<text>Heinsberg is a Kreis (district) in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany with the town of Heinsberg as its capital. Neighbouring districts are Viersen, Neuss, Düren and Aachen, the city of Mönchengladbach and the Dutch province Limburg.

==Geography==
Heinsberg is the most westerly district of Germany, reaching 5°52&#x27;E in Selfkant municipality.

Geographically it covers the lowlands of the Lower Rhine Bay.

===Rivers===
*Rur is the main river, crossing the district from southeast to northwest.
*Wurm flows into river Rur, in Heinsberg.
*Schwalm originates near Erkelenz.
*Niers rises near Kuckum.

===Towns and municipalities===

==History==
===Development of the district===
The area fell to Prussia in 1815, which in 1816 created the three districts Heinsberg, Erkelenz and Geilenkirchen. In 1932 the districts Heinsberg and Geilenkirchen were merged, and in 1972 Erkelenz district was merged as well. In 1975 the district reached its present size when the municipality Niederkrüchten was moved to the district Viersen.

===Prominent role in the Covid-19 pandemic===
The district became a center of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The Robert Koch Institute listed Heinsberg as an especially affected area (). Since the first cases were discovered in this area, the district was around two weeks &quot;ahead&quot; of the rest of Germany. A research group of the University of Bonn started to use the affected area as a testing site to study the novel coronavirus and to search for ways to handle the situation in the best possible way.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms show two lions in the top part, in the left the silver lion of the city and the dukes of Heinsberg, in the right the black lion on yellow ground of the duchy of Jülich. The bottom part derives from the coat of arms of the former district Erkelenz, the fleur-de-lis from the city of Erkelenz represent the Maria-abbey in Aachen, and the blue flax flower in the middle remembers the old tradition of flax and linen trading in Erkelenz.

<text>The National Railway Museum (NRM) is a museum in York, England, forming part of the Science Museum Group. The museum tells the story of rail transport in Britain and its impact on society. It is the home of the national collection of historically significant railway vehicles such as Mallard, Stirling Single, Duchess of Hamilton and a Japanese bullet train. In addition, the National Railway Museum holds a diverse collection of other objects, from a household recipe book used in George Stephenson&#x27;s house to film showing a &quot;never-stop railway&quot; developed for the British Empire Exhibition. It has won many awards, including the European Museum of the Year Award in 2001.

Starting in 2019, a major site development was underway. As part of the York Central redevelopment which will divert Leeman Road, the National Railway Museum will be building a new entrance building to connect the two separate parts of the museum together. At the same time, the space around the museum was to be landscaped to provide public spaces.

In 2020, architectural practice Feilden Fowles won an international competition to create the museum&#x27;s new £16.5 million Central Hall building—a key element of the museum&#x27;s Vision 2025 masterplan. In January 2023, the museum&#x27;s Station Hall (a Grade II listed &quot;former goods station built between 1875–77&quot;) was closed for an estimated 18 months for &quot;urgent structural repair&quot; which was to include the installation of a new roof over that area. 

==Overview==
The National Railway Museum has over 6,000 objects on display of which around 100 are locomotives or rolling stock which tell the stories for Britain&#x27;s railway innovation. The collection also includes fine jewellery worn by railway queens, models of planes, boats and hovercraft, and experimental technologies such as Louis Brennan&#x27;s Gyroscopic Mono-rail car.

It is the largest museum of its type in Britain, attracting 782,000 visitors during the 2018/19 financial year (the largest in the world in terms of floor area of exhibition buildings is Cité du Train in the French town of Mulhouse, although this attracts far fewer visitors than the National Railway Museum).

The National Railway Museum was established on its present site, the former York North locomotive depot, in 1975, when it took over the former British Railways collection located in Clapham and the York Railway Museum located off Queen Street, immediately to the southeast of the railway station; since then, the collection has continued to grow.

The museum is accessible on foot from York railway station. A &quot;roadtrain&quot; runs from the city centre (near York Minster) to the museum on Leeman Road during half-term, holidays and summer. York Park and Ride also serve the museum from the car park entrance, on Line 2 (Rawcliffe Bar-York). Admission to the museum has been free since 2001. It is open daily from 10 am to 5 pm during February half-term holiday, then Wednesday to Sunday only from 10 am to 5 pm. Since 3 January 2023, the Station Hall is closed for re-roofing, repair work and redecoration, with some of the exhibits displayed there closed. Due to reopen late 2024.

Locomotion – the National Railway Museum in Shildon, County Durham was opened in October 2004 and is operated by the NRM in conjunction with Durham County Council. It houses more of the National Collection in a new building and a historic site around the former workshop of Timothy Hackworth and in the most recent full year for which figures have been published (2011–2012), it attracted more than 210,000 visitors.

==National Collection==

There are approximately 280 rail vehicles in the National Collection, with around 100 being at York at any one time and the remainder divided between Locomotion at Shildon and other museums and heritage railways. The earliest are wagonway vehicles of about 1815. The permanent display includes &quot;Palaces on Wheels&quot;, a collection of Royal Train saloons from Queen Victoria&#x27;s early trains through to those used by Queen Elizabeth II up to the 1970s, among them some of the first rail vehicles to be set aside for preservation.
Other key exhibits normally to be seen at York include the 1846 Furness Railway No. 3 &quot;Coppernob&quot; locomotive, and the more modern express passenger steam locomotives London and North Eastern Railway Class A3 No. 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; (added to the collection in 2004),
its streamlined sister Class A4 No. 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; and London, Midland and Scottish Railway Princess Coronation Class No. 6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot;. &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; is among the exhibits intended for operation on the National Rail network from time to time.

The museum has imported several major vehicles for display: the Chinese Class KF7 4-8-4 locomotive donated in 1981 was built in Britain and the &quot;Wagons-Lits&quot; sleeping car donated in 1980 had been used on the Paris-London &quot;Night Ferry&quot; service. The single exception to the rule of exhibits associated with Britain is the Japanese 0 Series Shinkansen leading vehicle which was donated to the museum by the West Japan Railway Company in 2001 and which now forms part of an award-winning display, and is one of only two Shinkansen vehicles on exhibit outside Japan.

Rail vehicles on display are exchanged from time to time with other organisations, and examples of new-build stock from the current industry sometimes visit the museum for short periods.

Other physically large exhibits are the Stockton and Darlington Railway Gaunless Bridge and several stationary winding engines used on railway inclines.

The many other two and three-dimensional elements of the collection include signalling equipment, road vehicles, ship models, posters, drawings and other artwork,
tickets, nameplates, staff uniforms, clocks, watches, furniture and equipment from railway companies&#x27; hotels, refreshment rooms and offices (including company seals) and a wide range of models, some of which are operated on the museum&#x27;s O scale model railway (originated in 1982).

===Search Engine===
The National Railway Museum holds a large open library and archive of railway related material. This includes an internationally significant collection of locomotive and rolling stock engineering drawings from railway works and independent manufacturing companies. Copies of many of these engineering drawings are sold to the heritage railway movement to assist with their new build locomotive and restoration projects. They are also sold to modellers who can use the drawing to produce accurate scale models. The library holds more than 20,000 books and 800 journals of which around 300 are active. The archive also holds a large collection of technical and test records, as well as timetables including a large number of Bradshaw timetables. The archives also hold some 1.75 million photographs covering the earliest era of photography to the modern day. These include official collections from railway companies and collections from enthusiasts like Eric Treacy and H. Gordon Tidey.

In 1999/2000 the Museum began to collect recordings of former railway staff for a National Archive of Railway Oral History. It also holds the archive of steam train recordings by Peter Handford. In 2009 The Forsythe Collection of travel and transport ephemera was acquired for the collection. Many of the museum&#x27;s artworks and posters can also be viewed through Search Engine although these are now displayed in a series of temporary exhibitions in the museum&#x27;s new art gallery which opened in 2011.

The Search Engine facility opened in late 2007 and is open from 10:00 to 17:30 Wednesday to Saturday. The archive and library collections can be viewed by anyone without an appointment although the website recommends pre-booking archive materials at least 24 hours in advance. The majority of its collections have been listed on its website for people to view what materials are available prior to their visit. For those people that cannot visit the museum itself there is a research service offered by the museum called Inreach.

==Origins==

Although there had been amateur attempts to establish a national railway museum from the late 19th century, the National Collection today results from the fusion of two long-running official initiatives. One was led by the State museums sector, evidencing pioneering technology, and the other by the railway industry, in which the key contribution came from the North Eastern Railway as successors to the historic Stockton and Darlington Railway.

What became the Science Museum collection was begun in the 1860s by the Patent Office, whose museum included such early relics as &quot;Puffing Billy&quot;, Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; and &quot;Agenoria&quot; (sister locomotive to &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot;), which was outhoused to York at an early date.

Preservation of redundant equipment by the railway companies themselves was a matter of chance. Sometimes relics were stored in company workshops and offices and some were destroyed as circumstances changed. Some were put on public display, usually at railway stations, displayed in a glass case or mounted on a plinth. &quot;Coppernob&quot; at Barrow-in-Furness, &quot;Derwent&quot; and &quot;Locomotion&quot; at Darlington and &quot;Tiny&quot; at Newton Abbot were long-lived examples of this form of display.

The first railway museums were opened at Hamar in Norway (1896) and Nuremberg in Germany (1899). These inspired talk of doing the same in Britain, both in the 1890s and again in 1908, but this came to nothing at that time. Indeed, two of the Great Western Railway&#x27;s earliest broad-gauge locomotives, &quot;North Star&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Isles&quot;, which had been set aside at Swindon Works, were cut up in 1906 for lack of space and several other relics were similarly lost in subsequent years.
From 1880, J. B. Harper of the North Eastern had been collecting material much of which was exhibited on the occasion of the S.&amp; D.R. centenary in 1925; and which then formed the basis of a museum opened at York by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1928 under the curatorship of E. M. Bywell.

The smaller exhibits were housed in the old station buildings and the rolling stock and other large exhibits in the former locomotive erecting and repair shops of the old York and North Midland Railway (demolished after the museum closed). Despite this however, the locomotives were displayed on short lengths of track acting as plinths, very much in traditional museum style. It was only when the NRM was formed that Britain acquired a rail-served railway museum where large exhibits could come and go with ease.

The collection was dominated by items from the North Eastern Railway, together with Great Northern Railway items. The other three &#x27;Big Four&#x27; railway companies showed little interest in contributing to the LNER&#x27;s initiative, though eventually one locomotive representative of each did find its way there: the Great Western&#x27;s &quot;City of Truro&quot;, London and North Western Railway &quot;Columbine&quot; and London, Brighton and South Coast Railway B1 Class &quot;Gladstone&quot;.

The GWR assembled a valuable collection of small objects, mounted privately in a long corridor at Paddington station, and in 1925 it built a replica of &quot;North Star&quot;. It preserved &quot;City of Truro&quot; and &quot;Tiny&quot; in 1931 and purchased &quot;Shannon&quot; for preservation in 1946.

The LMS had its own collection of small objects at . It also began to build up a collection of historic locomotives, which included Caledonian 123, &quot;Columbine&quot;, &quot;Cornwall&quot;, &quot;Hardwicke&quot;, Highland 103, Midland 118 and &quot;Pet&quot;. Three others, set aside for preservation at Crewe Works, were scrapped in a change of policy in 1932. The LMS set aside one further locomotive (Midland 158A) before it was overtaken by nationalisation. It also succeeded in preserving a collection of historic royal saloons at Wolverton and built a replica &quot;Rocket&quot;, with six replica carriages, for the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway centenary in 1930, and a replica Grand Junction Railway Travelling Post Office.

The Southern Railway inherited three preserved carriages of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway, long displayed at York and at Waterloo station, but otherwise had no policy of preserving redundant equipment. &quot;Ryde&quot; was preserved from 1934 until cut up in 1940; the only other locomotive preserved by the Southern was &quot;Boxhill&quot; in 1947. (&quot;Gladstone&quot; was preserved by the Stephenson Locomotive Society as a private initiative and much later (in 1959) donated to the British Transport Commission.)
The nationalisation of British Railways in 1948 gave the opportunity for a more consolidated approach and a report was produced by the British Transport Commission in 1951.

Amongst other things this recommended a curator be appointed for the commission&#x27;s holdings (John M. Scholes), retention of the York museum, creation of other regional museums (not carried out in the way proposed), a small relics display in the old Great Hall at Euston railway station (done on a temporary basis) and a large museum of collections elsewhere in London. For the latter, the former station at Nine Elms was originally favoured as a site, but what was eventually opened in 1961 was the Museum of British Transport in a former bus garage in Clapham.
An official list of locomotives for preservation was compiled,
and many were stored in sheds and works throughout the country, others being placed on loan to local authority museums. The &#x27;Steam&#x27; Museum at Swindon still displays a large number of items from the National Collection, while the Glasgow Museum of Transport was also indebted to it, although many of the Scottish relics (including NBR K &#x27;Glen&#x27; Class 4-4-0 No. 256 &quot;Glen Douglas&quot; currently at the successor to the Glasgow Museum of Transport, the Riverside Museum, along with the previously mentioned locomotives) no longer form part of the National Collection.

The Beeching Report recommended that British Rail should stop running museums, and a campaign was led by transport historian L. T. C. Rolt and others such as the historian Jack Simmons to create a new museum.
Agreement was reached under terms in the Transport Act 1968 for B.R. to provide premises to be occupied by a National Railway Museum which would be a branch of the National Museum of Science and Industry then under Dame Margaret Weston and the first English national museum outside London – a move which was at the time criticised by Londoners.

The building provided was the former locomotive roundhouse at York North (rebuilt in the 1950s), alongside the East Coast Main Line. The old museum and that at Clapham were closed in 1973. A Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket now stands on the Clapham site. Some items were retained in the capital and formed the basis of the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden. Some from York were re-located to the Head of Steam museum in Darlington. Exhibits from the previous museums at York and Clapham moved to the new site were supplemented by vehicles taken from storage at Preston Park in Brighton and elsewhere and restored. Creation of the York museum was largely in the hands of its first keeper, John Coiley,
his deputy Peter Semmens,
John Van Riemsdijk of the Science Museum and David Jenkinson.

==Growth 1975–2000==

The museum was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1975. The opening coincided with the 150th anniversary celebrations of the opening of the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway, for which several working exhibits were provided. By comparison with the museum&#x27;s predecessors coverage of ordinary passenger coaches and non-steam motive power was enhanced, but a popular new exhibit was ex-Southern Railway Merchant Navy Class No. 35029 &quot;Ellerman Lines&quot; sectioned to show the workings of a steam locomotive. The new museum received over a million visitors in its first year and was favourably received by critics.

Significant events of 1979 were the restoration of a train of appropriate vehicles to mark the centenary of on-train catering and an exhibition to mark the centenary of railway electric traction which drew attention to the museum&#x27;s important collections in this area.

Also in 1979 the museum commissioned a working replica of Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot; for the following year&#x27;s Liverpool and Manchester Railway 150th anniversary. This has since represented the museum at events around the world.

Another working replica was added to the collection for the 150th anniversary of establishment of the Great Western Railway in 1985: that of the broad gauge locomotive &quot;Iron Duke&quot;.

In 1990, The Rev. W. Awdry&#x27;s &quot;Railway Series&quot; Thomas the Tank Engine books were assured a permanent place in the NRM&#x27;s collection of historical railway books, due to their role in maintaining children&#x27;s interests in railways. In 1991, Christopher Awdry chose to fictionalise this event in &quot;Thomas and the Great Railway Show&quot;, where Thomas (the most iconic of Awdry&#x27;s characters) was made an honorary member of the NRM collection by Sir Topham Hatt and the Director of the NRM.

Concerns about the condition of the concrete roof structure on the main building brought forward major changes to the museum in 1990. To maintain a presence at York, the former York goods depot across Leeman Road, already in use as a museum store (the Peter Allen Building), was configured to display trains as if in a passenger station, and this together with the adjacent South Yard was marketed as &quot;The Great Railway Show&quot;. A further selection of exhibits formed the &quot;National Railway Museum on Tour&quot; on display for a season in the former Swindon Works.

Meanwhile, the main building was completely re-roofed and reconstructed retaining only one of the two original 1954 turntables.
It was reopened on 16 April 1992 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent as the Great Hall giving enhanced opportunities to display large artifacts such as railway signals, a footbridge from Percy Main station and a segment from the Channel Tunnel. The former goods shed display was retained as the Station Hall.

In 1995 the museum joined forces with the University of York to create an academic research base, the Institute of Railway Studies (and Transport History). It has also since partnered with York College to create the Yorkshire Rail Academy to teach vocational skills. The museum has also provided engineering apprenticeships and participates in partnerships aimed at delivering heritage skills training.

In 1996 the Museum Garden was created incorporating a gauge ridable miniature railway. A playground was also added.

Continued concern over the condition of the remaining 1950s buildings on the site led to their replacement by &quot;The Works&quot; in 1999. This gave several functional areas: the &quot;Workshop&quot;, for maintenance of rolling stock; the &quot;Workshop Gallery&quot;, from which the public can look down on this work; a &quot;Working Railway Gallery&quot;, giving an insight into current and recent operation including a balcony overlooking York railway station hosting a set of monitors showing live feeds from the monitors at York IECC; and the &quot;Warehouse&quot; which provides an innovative open storage area, which has proved popular with both public and museum professionals.

==Developments in the 21st century==

In order to provide step-free access from the main hall to the Workshop Gallery, the Museum Inclinator was constructed. Besides its primary function, this also served to demonstrate the workings of a funicular railway. To that end its workings were exposed in the style of a larger open air funicular railway, rather than being concealed in the fabric of the building as is more normal for intramural lifts. It ceased working due to lack of spare parts, and with no plans for repair it was removed by August 2013.

2004 saw several major developments at the museum. Several railway anniversaries were celebrated by a major &quot;Railfest&quot;.

Another took place from 25 to 30 May 2008 with a Sixties theme. The Locomotion museum was opened at Shildon, County Durham providing undercover collection care facilities for more rail vehicles (particularly freight wagons) from the museum&#x27;s collection. In addition, the museum had a high-profile campaign, supported by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, to purchase &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; which arrived at the Museum as the climax of Railfest.

The first stage of a new centre providing easy access to the museum&#x27;s Library and Archives, called &quot;Search Engine&quot;, opened at the end of 2007.

From 18 July to 23 August 2008, a popular new venture was the staging by York Theatre Royal at the Museum of the play of E. Nesbit&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Children&quot;, awarded five stars in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Following this success, it was repeated in 2009, from 23 July to 3 September, and the museum provided locomotives for subsequent performances at Waterloo International station and in Toronto.

Major plans under the name &quot;NRM+&quot; were made for refurbishing the Great Hall display, for which a preliminary Heritage Lottery Fund contribution was announced in 2009, and seeking potential partners for a further outhousing project.

There are other partnerships for development of the museum estate and the land around it (much owned by Network Rail) as &quot;York Central&quot; but the economic situation during 2009 put these particular plans in abeyance although a similar York Central project was launched by the city council at the beginning of 2016. The NRM+ project was cancelled in April 2011 due to lack of success in assembling the funding package. However, major changes to the displays in the Station Hall began later in 2011.

In 2012, the NRM decided to repatriate temporarily the two LNER A4 class steam locomotives, numbers 60008 &quot;Dwight D Eisenhower&quot; and 60010 &quot;Dominion of Canada&quot; from their respective North American homes at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin and Exporail in Montreal, as part of the &quot;&#x27;Mallard&quot; 75&#x27; event in 2013. The two locomotives would be on loan for up to two years, during which time the locomotives would be cosmetically restored, 60008 in BR Brunswick Green (as it appeared in 1963 on withdrawal) and 60010 as LNER 4489 in Garter Blue with its original Canadian Pacific Railway bell (as it appeared in 1939).

The same year, the NRM created an iPhone App in association with East Coast that allowed people travelling between London and Edinburgh on the East Coast Main Line through York to view objects from the collection in connection with locations on the route. It has since been removed from the App Store, and the page removed from the official NRM website.

On 8 December 2012 it was announced that an annex to the National Railway Museum would be built close to Leicester North station on the Great Central Railway.

===Funding crisis point===
In June 2013, the &quot;York Press&quot; reported that NRM was facing a funding crisis due to a potential 10% annual cut to the Science Museum Group&#x27;s funding, an estimated real-terms 25% cut following lay-offs and disbandment of projects. The museum was considering scaling down its functions, re-introducing admissions charges or facing complete closure. However, following a campaign by local residents the Chancellor George Osborne announced a 5% cut in the museum&#x27;s budget. This prompted Science Museum Group director Ian Blatchford to announce two weeks later that the museum had been doubly saved — he added that had the 10% cut taken place the Group would have chosen to close the National Media Museum in Bradford.

==Policies==

Criticisms of the museum which have been raised include claims that it has devoted insufficient attention to modern traction; that it was neglecting scholarship in favour of commercialism; or that its photographic collections constitute a &quot;black hole&quot;. The museum&#x27;s response is that these criticisms do not always take into account the financial constraints under which the museum operates: its Grant in Aid from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport amounts to £6.50 per visitor which delivers less overall income than for comparable London museums. For some of its funding the museum depends on money-making events such as the Yorkshire Wheel, which operated at the museum from 2006 to 2008 and visits from Thomas the Tank Engine as chronicled in &quot;Thomas and the Great Railway Show&quot;. The museum has also suffered a few thefts of objects.

The museum can be allocated material from the railway industry by the Railway Heritage Committee. Because of the diversity of material falling potentially within the museum&#x27;s collection policy and the problems of caring for it, decisions on acquisition of new items for the collection can be difficult. Previously the museum has treated rolling stock as if it were effectively still in railway service and capable of undergoing repeated heavy repairs and restoration. Since being preserved many of the museum&#x27;s locomotives have operated on the main line, heritage railways or at the museum. More recently, there have been moves to less interventionist forms of conservation in some cases leading to some exhibits becoming non-operational.

The Museum&#x27;s management of the protracted overhaul of LNER Class A3 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; was heavily criticised in an internally commissioned report in 2012.

Since 1977, the Friends of the National Railway Museum have been in existence as a group to give financial and other support to the museum, such as financing the original restoration to steam of &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot;.

The 1990 &quot;Great Railway Show&quot; won the Museum of the Year award and in 2001 the museum gained the European Museum of the Year Award. It has also won White Rose awards from the Yorkshire Tourist Board, and in recognition of the several major developments in 2004 was given the Heritage Railway Association&#x27;s Peter Manisty Award.

==Online presence==
The National Railway Museum website offers a facility for visitors to plan their visit to the museum in advance. The museum also has a policy of improving access to its collections via its website. It has uploaded some of the recordings from the National Archive of Railway History to its website. The museum&#x27;s archives and library service Search Engine is increasingly making its collection accessible online by providing catalogues and lists for researchers to search before visiting and adding low resolution copies of its drawing online. The library collection can be searched through the University of York library catalogue. All of the museum&#x27;s rolling stock and a large amount of other material has also been added to the website.

The National Railway Museum also has a presence on a number of other websites. Copies of many of its posters, photographs and artworks can be ordered through the Science and Society Picture Library. The National Railway Museum has a presence on the National Preservation forums. Members and Readers are able to talk and comment directly to members of the staff. Providing both feedback and constructive criticism, a valuable source of information for the museum. Members of staff can usually answer questions when they are not busy and are part of the National Railway Museum group. National Railway Museum staff also publish a blog via WordPress.com where staff write stories about events behind the scenes in the museum such as conservation work or preparation for major events.

==Locomotives==

These are a few of the Museum&#x27;s locomotives (listed by operational state, and then by date the design was introduced).
;Operational steam locomotives
* SR Schools class 4-4-0 No. 925 &quot;Cheltenham&quot;. Currently working on the Mid Hants Railway. Boiler certification expires in 2022.
* LNER Class A3 4-6-2 60103 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;. Overhaul started in 2006 by the NRM. After an external review the restoration was taken over by Riley and Son and completed in 2016. Withdrawn from traffic in early 2022, it was overhauled and brought back into steam in time for its 100th birthday in 2023.

;Steam locomotives under overhaul/stored
* SR Lord Nelson Class 4-6-0 No. 850 &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;. Currently working on the Mid Hants Railway. Boiler certification expired in 2016.
* SR N15 Class 4-6-0 No. 30777 &quot;Sir Lamiel&quot;. Currently undergoing overhaul at the Great Central Railway. Withdrawn from service in 2017 after boiler ticket expired and undergoing mainline standard overhaul.
* Great Central Railway O4 Class 2-8-0 No. 63601. Currently on the Great Central Railway. Withdrawn in 2012 for overhaul.
* British Railways Standard Class 7 &quot;Britannia&quot; 4-6-2 70013 &quot;Oliver Cromwell&quot;. Overhauled at the Great Central Railway (Loughborough) between 2004 and 2008. Boiler certificate expired in December 2018. Currently based at Loughborough undergoing mainline standard overhaul.

;Steam locomotives on static display
* Stephenson&#x27;s 0-2-2 &quot;Rocket&quot;. Two replicas are also in the York collection, one built for operation (rebuilt 2019) and one sectioned. The original was with the parent body, the Science Museum in London, until 2018.
* NER No. 66 &quot;Aerolite&quot;. On static display in York since 1934.
* GWR 4000 Class 4-6-0 4003 &quot;Lode Star&quot;. Returned to the NRM in November 2015 from the Museum of the Great Western Railway, Swindon as part of an exchange of locomotives in preparation for Swindon 175 in 2016.
* LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 5000. On static display.
* LNWR Class G2 (&quot;Super D&quot;) 0-8-0 No. 49395. Currently at Locomotion, Shildon on static display.
* LNER Class A4 4-6-2 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot;. Restored to steam for a time from 1986; now on static display. Unlikely to run again due to exhibit popularity, the internals of the locomotive being in considerable disrepair, and the fact that all the other A4s in the UK have been restored to working order.
* SR Class Q1 0-6-0 No. C1. On static display. However it is possible it will return to the Bluebell Railway, where it was based for many years, to be returned to service.
* BR Standard Class 9F 2-10-0 92220 &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the last steam locomotive built for British Railways. On static display and not expected to return to working order due to class being barred from running on the national network. Returned to York in 2010 after a two-year loan to the Museum of the Great Western Railway, Swindon.
* LMS Princess Coronation Class 4-6-2 6229 &quot;Duchess of Hamilton&quot;. Returned to the NRM in 2009 after being re-streamlined, it was at first displayed in an exhibit, &quot;Streamlined: Styling an era&quot;.

;Steam locomotives located away from York
* GWR 3700 Class 4-4-0 3440 &quot;City of Truro&quot;. Loaned to the Museum of the Great Western Railway in November 2015 as part of an exchange of locomotives in preparation for Swindon 175 in 2016.
* GWR 6000 Class 4-6-0 6000 &quot;King George V&quot;. Loaned to the Museum of the Great Western Railway in November 2015 as part of an exchange of locomotives in preparation for Swindon 175 in 2016.

<doc id="186342" wikidata="Q24773045" url="?curid=186342" title="Glutathione peroxidase">
<text>Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) () is the general name of an enzyme family with peroxidase activity whose main biological role is to protect the organism from oxidative damage. The biochemical function of glutathione peroxidase is to reduce lipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and to reduce free hydrogen peroxide to water.

== Isozymes ==
Several isozymes are encoded by different genes, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. Glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) is the most abundant version, found in the cytoplasm of nearly all mammalian tissues, whose preferred substrate is hydrogen peroxide. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides; it is expressed in nearly every mammalian cell, though at much lower levels. Glutathione peroxidase 2 is an intestinal and extracellular enzyme, while glutathione peroxidase 3 is extracellular, especially abundant in plasma. So far, eight different isoforms of glutathione peroxidase (GPx1-8) have been identified in humans.

== Reaction ==
The main reaction that glutathione peroxidase catalyzes is:
: 2GSH + H2O2 → GS–SG + 2H2O
where GSH represents reduced monomeric glutathione, and GS–SG represents glutathione disulfide. The mechanism involves oxidation of the selenol of a selenocysteine residue by hydrogen peroxide. This process gives the derivative with a selenenic acid (RSeOH) group. The selenenic acid is then converted back to the selenol by a two step process that begins with reaction with GSH to form the GS-SeR and water. A second GSH molecule reduces the GS-SeR intermediate back to the selenol, releasing GS-SG as the by-product. A simplified representation is shown below:
: RSeH + H2O2 → RSeOH + H2O
: RSeOH + GSH → GS-SeR + H2O
: GS-SeR + GSH → GS-SG + RSeH

Glutathione reductase then reduces the oxidized glutathione to complete the cycle:
: GS–SG + NADPH + H+ → 2 GSH + NADP+.

== Structure ==
Mammalian GPx1, GPx2, GPx3, and GPx4 have been shown to be selenium-containing enzymes, whereas GPx6 is a selenoprotein in humans with cysteine-containing homologues in rodents. GPx1, GPx2, and GPx3 are homotetrameric proteins, whereas GPx4 has a monomeric structure. As the integrity of the cellular and subcellular membranes depends heavily on glutathione peroxidase, its antioxidative protective system itself depends heavily on the presence of selenium.

== Animal models ==

Mice genetically engineered to lack glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1−/− mice) are grossly phenotypically normal and have normal lifespans, indicating this enzyme is not critical for life. However, Gpx1−/− mice develop cataracts at an early age and exhibit defects in muscle satellite cell proliferation. Gpx1 −/− mice showed up to 16 dB higher auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds than control mice. After 110 dB noise exposure for one hour, Gpx1 −/− mice had up to 15 dB greater noise-induced hearing loss compared with control mice.&quot;

Mice with knockouts for GPX3 (GPX3−/−) or GPX2 (GPX2−/−) also develop normally 

However, glutathione peroxidase 4 knockout mice die during early embryonic development. Some evidence, though, indicates reduced levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 can increase life expectancy in mice.

The &quot;bovine&quot; erythrocyte enzyme has a molecular weight of 84 kDa.

== Discovery ==

Glutathione peroxidase was discovered in 1957 by Gordon C. Mills.

== Methods for determining glutathione peroxidase activity ==
Activity of glutathione peroxidase is measured spectrophotometrically using several methods. A direct assay by linking the peroxidase reaction with glutathione reductase with measurement of the conversion of NADPH to NADP is widely used. The other approach is measuring residual GSH in the reaction with Ellman&#x27;s reagent. Based on this, several procedures for measuring glutathione peroxidase activity were developed using various hydroperoxides as substrates for reduction, e.g. cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide.

The other methods include the use of CUPRAC reagent with spectrophotometric detection of the reaction product or &quot;o&quot;-phtalaldehyde as a fluorescent reagent.

== Clinical significance ==

It has been shown that low levels of glutathione peroxidase as measured in the serum may be a contributing factor to vitiligo. Lower plasma glutathione peroxide levels were also observed in patients with type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria and this was correlated to the stage of diabetic nephropathy. In one study, the activity of glutathione peroxidase along with other antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase was not associated with coronary heart disease risk in women. Glutathione peroxidase activity was found to be much lower in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. One study has suggested that glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase polymorphisms play a role in the development of celiac disease.

The activity of this enzyme has been reported to be decreased in case of copper deficiency in the liver and plasma.

<text>&quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation () is the process of protecting an endangered species, variety, or breed of plant or animal outside its natural habitat. For example, by removing part of the population from a threatened habitat and placing it in a new location, an artificial environment which is similar to the natural habitat of the respective animal and within the care of humans, such as a zoological park or wildlife sanctuary. The degree to which humans control or modify the natural dynamics of the managed population varies widely, and this may include alteration of living environments, reproductive patterns, access to resources, and protection from predation and mortality.

&quot;Ex situ&quot; management can occur within or outside a species&#x27; natural geographic range. Individuals maintained &quot;ex situ&quot; exist outside an ecological niche. This means that they are not under the same selection pressures as wild populations, and they may undergo artificial selection if maintained &quot;ex situ&quot; for multiple generations.

Agricultural biodiversity is also conserved in &quot;ex situ&quot; collections. This is primarily in the form of gene banks where samples are stored in order to conserve the genetic resources of major crop plants and their wild relatives.

==Facilities==
=== Botanical gardens, zoos, and aquariums ===

Botanical gardens, zoos, and aquariums are the most conventional sites for &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation, housing whole, protected specimens for breeding and reintroduction into the wild. These facilities provide not only housing and care for specimens of endangered species, but also have an educational value. They inform the public of the threatened status of endangered species and of those factors which cause the threat, with the hope of creating public interest in stopping and reversing those factors which jeopardize a species&#x27; survival in the first place. They are the most publicly visited &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation sites, with the WZCS (World Zoo Conservation Strategy) estimating that the 1,100 organized zoos in the world receive more than 600 million visitors annually. Globally there is an estimated total of 2,107 aquaria and zoos in 125 countries. Additionally many private collectors or other not-for-profit groups hold animals and they engage in conservation or reintroduction efforts. Similarly there are approximately 2,000 botanical gardens in 148 counties cultivating or storing an estimated 80,000 taxa of plants.

==Techniques for plants==
===Cryopreservation===
Plant cryopreservation consist of the storage of seeds, pollen, tissue, or embryos in liquid nitrogen. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation. Cryopreservation is also used for the conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation of animal genetic resources. Technical limitations prevent the cryopreservation of many species, but cryobiology is a field of active research, and many studies concerning plants are underway .

===Seed banking===
The storage of seeds in a temperature and moisture controlled environment. This technique is used for taxa with orthodox seeds that tolerate desiccation. Seed bank facilities vary from sealed boxes to climate controlled walk-in freezers or vaults. Taxa with recalcitrant seeds that do not tolerate desiccation are typically not held in seed banks for extended periods of time.

===Field gene banking===
An extensive open-air planting used maintain genetic diversity of wild, agricultural, or forestry species. Typically species that are either difficult or impossible to conserve in seed banks are conserved in field gene banks. Field gene banks may also be used grow and select progeny of species stored by other &quot;ex situ&quot; techniques.

===Cultivation collections===
Plants under horticultural care in a constructed landscape, typically a botanic garden or arboreta. This technique is similar to a field gene bank in that plants are maintained in the ambient environment, but the collections are typically not as genetically diverse or extensive. These collections are susceptible to hybridization, artificial selection, genetic drift, and disease transmission. Species that cannot be conserved by other &quot;ex situ&quot; techniques are often included in cultivated collections.

===Inter situ===
Plants are under horticulture care, but the environment is managed to near natural conditions. This occurs with either restored or semi-natural environments. This technique is primarily used for taxa that are rare or in areas where habitat has been severely degraded.

=== Tissue culture (storage and propagation) ===
Somatic tissue can be stored &quot;in vitro&quot; for short periods of time. This is done in a light and temperature controlled environment that regulates the growth of cells. As an &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation technique tissue culture is primary used for clonal propagation of vegetative tissue or immature seeds. This allows for the proliferation of clonal plants from a relatively small amount of parent tissue.

==Techniques for animals==
Endangered animal species and breeds are preserved using similar techniques. Animal species can be preserved in genebanks, which consist of cryogenic facilities used to store living sperm, eggs, or embryos. For example, the Zoological Society of San Diego has established a &quot;frozen zoo&quot; to store such samples using cryopreservation techniques from more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.

A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is interspecific pregnancy, implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term. It has been carried out for the Spanish ibex.

==Genetic management of captive populations==
Captive populations are subject to problems such as inbreeding depression, loss of genetic diversity and adaptations to captivity. It is important to manage captive populations in a way that minimizes these issues so that the individuals to be introduced will resemble the original founders as closely as possible, which will increase the chances of successful reintroductions. During the initial growth phase, the population size is rapidly expanded until a target population size is reached. The target population size is the number of individuals that are required to maintain appropriate levels of genetic diversity, which is generally considered to be 90% of the current genetic diversity after 100 years. The number of individuals required to meet this goal varies based on potential growth rate, effective size, current genetic diversity, and generation time. Once the target population size is reached, the focus shifts to maintaining the population and avoiding genetic issues within the captive population.

===Minimizing mean kinship===
Managing populations based on minimizing mean kinship values is often an effective way to increase genetic diversity and to avoid inbreeding within captive populations. Kinship is the probability that two alleles will be identical by descent when one allele is taken randomly from each mating individual. The mean kinship value is the average kinship value between a given individual and every other member of the population. Mean kinship values can help determine which individuals should be mated. In choosing individuals for breeding, it is important to choose individuals with the lowest mean kinship values because these individuals are least related to the rest of the population and have the least common alleles. This ensures that rarer alleles are passed on, which helps to increase genetic diversity. It is also important to avoid mating two individuals with very different mean kinship values because such pairings propagate both the rare alleles that are present in the individual with the low mean kinship value as well as the common alleles that are present in the individual with the high mean kinship value. This genetic management technique requires that ancestry is known, so in circumstances where ancestry is unknown, it might be necessary to use molecular genetics such as microsatellite data to help resolve unknowns.

===Avoiding loss of genetic diversity===
Genetic diversity is often lost within captive populations due to the founder effect and subsequent small population sizes. Minimizing the loss of genetic diversity within the captive population is an important component of &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation and is critical for successful reintroductions and the long term success of the species, since more diverse populations have higher adaptive potential. The loss of genetic diversity due to the founder effect can be minimized by ensuring that the founder population is large enough and genetically representative of the wild population. This is often difficult because removing large numbers of individuals from the wild populations may further reduce the genetic diversity of a species that is already of conservation concern. An alternative to this is collecting sperm from wild individuals and using this via artificial insemination to bring in fresh genetic material. Maximizing the captive population size and the effective population size can decrease the loss of genetic diversity by minimizing the random loss of alleles due to genetic drift. Minimizing the number of generations in captivity is another effective method for reducing the loss of genetic diversity in captive populations.

===Avoiding adaptations to captivity===
Selection favors different traits in captive populations than it does in wild populations, so this may result in adaptations that are beneficial in captivity but are deleterious in the wild. This reduces the success of re-introductions, so it is important to manage captive populations in order to reduce adaptations to captivity. Adaptations to captivity can be reduced by minimizing the number of generations in captivity and by maximizing the number of migrants from wild populations. Minimizing selection on captive populations by creating an environment that is similar to their natural environment is another method of reducing adaptations to captivity, but it is important to find a balance between an environment that minimizes adaptation to captivity and an environment that permits adequate reproduction. Adaptations to captivity can also be reduced by managing the captive population as a series of population fragments. In this management strategy, the captive population is split into several sub-populations or fragments which are maintained separately. Smaller populations have lower adaptive potentials, so the population fragments are less likely to accumulate adaptations associated with captivity. The fragments are maintained separately until inbreeding becomes a concern. Immigrants are then exchanged between the fragments to reduce inbreeding, and then the fragments are managed separately again.

===Managing genetic disorders===
Genetic disorders are often an issue within captive populations due to the fact that the populations are usually established from a small number of founders. In large, outbreeding populations, the frequencies of most deleterious alleles are relatively low, but when a population undergoes a bottleneck during the founding of a captive population, previously rare alleles may survive and increase in number. Further inbreeding within the captive population may also increase the likelihood that deleterious alleles will be expressed due to increasing homozygosity within the population. The high occurrence of genetic disorders within a captive population can threaten both the survival of the captive population and its eventual reintroduction back into the wild. If the genetic disorder is dominant, it may be possible to eliminate the disease completely in a single generation by avoiding breeding of the affected individuals. However, if the genetic disorder is recessive, it may not be possible to completely eliminate the allele due to its presence in unaffected heterozygotes. In this case, the best option is to attempt to minimize the frequency of the allele by selectively choosing mating pairs. In the process of eliminating genetic disorders, it is important to consider that when certain individuals are prevented from breeding, alleles and therefore genetic diversity are removed from the population; if these alleles are not present in other individuals, they may be lost completely. Preventing certain individuals from the breeding also reduces the effective population size, which is associated with problems such as the loss of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding.

==Examples==
Showy Indian clover, &quot;Trifolium amoenum&quot;, is an example of a species that was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered in 1993 in the form of a single plant at a site in western Sonoma County. Seeds were harvested and the species grown in &quot;ex situ&quot; facilities.

The Wollemi pine is another example of a plant that is being preserved via &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation, as they are being grown in nurseries to be sold to the general public.

The Orange-bellied parrot, with a wild population of 14 birds as of early February 2017, are being bred in a captive breeding program. The captive population consists of around 300 birds.

==Drawbacks==

&quot;Ex situ&quot; conservation, while helpful in humankind&#x27;s efforts to sustain and protect our environment, is rarely enough to save a species from extinction. It is to be used as a last resort, or as a supplement to &quot;in situ&quot; conservation because it cannot recreate the habitat as a whole: the entire genetic variation of a species, its symbiotic counterparts, or those elements which, over time, might help a species adapt to its changing surroundings. Instead, &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation removes the species from its natural ecological contexts, preserving it under semi-isolated conditions whereby natural evolution and adaptation processes are either temporarily halted or altered by introducing the specimen to an unnatural habitat. In the case of cryogenic storage methods, the preserved specimen&#x27;s adaptation processes are (quite literally) frozen altogether. The downside to this is that, when re-released, the species may lack the genetic adaptations and mutations which would allow it to thrive in its ever-changing natural habitat.

Furthermore, &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation techniques are often costly, with cryogenic storage being economically infeasible in most cases since species stored in this manner cannot provide a profit but instead slowly drain the financial resources of the government or organization determined to operate them. Seedbanks are ineffective for certain plant genera with recalcitrant seeds that do not remain fertile for long periods of time. Diseases and pests foreign to the species, to which the species has no natural defense, may also cripple crops of protected plants in &quot;ex situ&quot; plantations and in animals living in &quot;ex situ&quot; breeding grounds. These factors, combined with the specific environmental needs of many species, some of which are nearly impossible to recreate by man, make &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation impossible for a great number of the world&#x27;s endangered flora and fauna.

<doc id="186347" wikidata="Q1639322" url="?curid=186347" title="Our American Cousin">
<text>Our American Cousin is a three-act play by English playwright Tom Taylor. It is a farce featuring awkward, boorish American Asa Trenchard, who is introduced to his aristocratic English relatives when he goes to England to claim the family estate. The play premiered with great success at Laura Keene&#x27;s Theatre in New York City in 1858, with Laura Keene in the cast, the title character played by Joseph Jefferson, and Edward Askew Sothern playing Lord Dundreary. The play&#x27;s long-running London production in 1861 was also successful.

The play quickly rose to great renown during its first few years and remained very popular throughout the second half of the 19th century. Despite achieving critical and audience acclaim throughout its production history, &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; is best known as the play that U.S. president Abraham Lincoln was attending in Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C. when he was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer who attempted to time the sound of his gunshot with the audience&#x27;s laughter on a particularly famous line.

==Theatrical acclaim and &quot;Lord Dundreary&quot;==

Among &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;&#x27;s cast was British actor Edward Askew Sothern, playing Lord Dundreary, a good natured but brainless English aristocrat. Sothern had already achieved fame on the New York stage in the play &quot;Camille&quot; in 1856, and had been reluctant to take on the role because he felt that it was too small and unimportant.

&quot;Our American Cousin&quot; premiered in New York on October 15, 1858. After several weeks of performances, Sothern began portraying the role more broadly, as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to nonsensical references to sayings of his &quot;bwother&quot; Sam. His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and mockery in both the United States and England. Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time.

Sothern made his London debut when the play opened at the Haymarket Theatre on 11 November 1861. Reviews were mixed. &quot;The Morning Post&quot; praised Sothern, but said that the play could scarcely be said to be worthy of his talents; &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; found the piece humorous and outrageous, and Sothern&#x27;s performance &quot;certainly the &quot;funniest&quot; thing in the world ... a vile caricature of an inane nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent&quot;; &quot;The Era&quot; thought the play &quot;a hasty work, manufactured to suit the American market ... a sort of dramatic curiosity&quot;. The play closed on 21 December 1861 after 36 performances; after this inauspicious start it was revived at the same theatre on 27 January 1862 and ran uninterruptedly until 23 December for 314 successive performances. Sothern successfully revived the play many times, making Dundreary by far his most famous role.

&quot;Dundrearyisms&quot;, twisted aphorisms in the style of Lord Dundreary (e.g. &quot;birds of a feather gather no moss&quot;), enjoyed a brief vogue. And the character&#x27;s style of beard – long, bushy sideburns – gave the English language the word &quot;&quot;. In his autobiography, writer George Robert Sims recalled that &quot;we went Dundreary mad in &#x27;61. The shop windows were filled with Dundreary scarves, and Brother Sam scarves, and there were Dundreary collars and Dundreary shirts, and Dundrearyisms were on every lip.&quot;

It was not long before the success of this play inspired an imitation, Charles Gayler&#x27;s &quot;Our Female American Cousin&quot;, which opened in New York City in January 1859. None of the characters from the original play appeared in this comedy. A number of sequel plays to &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; were written, all featuring several characters from the original, and focusing on the Lord Dundreary character. The first was Gayler&#x27;s &quot;Our American Cousin at Home, or, Lord Dundreary Abroad&quot;, which premiered in Buffalo, New York, in November 1860, and had its New York City debut the following May. Later sequels included Henry James Byron&#x27;s &quot;Dundreary Married and Done For&quot;, and John Oxenford&#x27;s &quot;Brother Sam&quot; (1862; revived in 1865), a play about Dundreary&#x27;s brother.

==Synopsis==
===Act I===

In the drawing room at Trenchard Manor, the servants remark on their employer&#x27;s poor financial circumstances. Florence Trenchard, an aristocratic young beauty, loves Lieutenant Harry Vernon of the Royal Navy, but she is unable to marry him until he progresses to a higher rank. She receives a letter from her brother Ned, who is currently in the United States. Ned has met some rustic cousins from a branch of the family that had immigrated to America two centuries earlier. They relay to Ned that great-uncle Mark Trenchard had, after angrily disinheriting his children and leaving England years ago, found these cousins in Brattleboro, Vermont. He had moved in with them and eventually made Asa, one of the sons, heir to his property in England. Asa is now sailing to England to claim the estate.

Asa is noisy, coarse, and vulgar, but honestly forthright and colourful. The English Trenchards are alternately amused and appalled by this Vermont cousin. Richard Coyle, agent of the estate, meets with Sir Edward Trenchard (Florence&#x27;s father) and tells the baronet that the family faces bankruptcy unless they can repay a debt to Coyle. Coyle is concealing the evidence that the loan had been repaid long ago by Sir Edward&#x27;s late father. Coyle suggests that the loan would be satisfied if he may marry Florence, who detests him. Meanwhile, Asa and the butler, Binny, try to understand each other&#x27;s unfamiliar ways, as Asa tries to understand what the purpose of a shower might be, dousing himself while fully clothed.

===Act II===

Mrs. Mountchessington is staying at Trenchard Manor. She advises Augusta, her daughter, to be attentive to the presumably wealthy Vermont &quot;savage&quot;. Meanwhile, her other daughter Georgina is courting an imbecilic nobleman named Dundreary by pretending to be ill. Florence&#x27;s old tutor, the unhappy alcoholic Abel Murcott, warns her that Coyle intends to marry her. Asa overhears this and offers Florence his help. Murcott is Coyle&#x27;s clerk and has found proof that Florence&#x27;s late grandfather paid off the loan to Coyle.

Florence and Asa visit her cousin, Mary Meredith. Mary is the granddaughter of old Mark Trenchard, who left his estate to Asa. Mary is very poor and has been raised as a humble dairy maid. Asa does not care about her social status and is attracted to her. Florence has not been able to bring herself to tell Mary that her grandfather&#x27;s fortune had been left to Asa. Florence tells Asa that she loves Harry, who needs a good assignment to a ship. Asa uses his country wile to persuade Dundreary to help Harry get a ship. Meanwhile, Coyle has been up to no good, and the bailiffs arrive at Trenchard Manor.

===Act III===
At her dairy farm, Asa tells Mary about her grandfather in America, but he fibs about the end of the tale: He says that old Mark Trenchard changed his mind about disinheriting his English children and burned his will. Asa promptly burns the will himself, under the pretext of lighting a cigar. Florence discovers this and points it out to Mary, saying: &quot;It means that he is a true hero, and he loves you, you little rogue.&quot; Meanwhile, Mrs. Mountchessington still hopes that Asa will propose to Augusta. When Asa tells them that Mark Trenchard had left Mary his fortune, Augusta and Mrs. Mountchessington are quite rude, but Asa stands up for himself.

Asa proposes to Mary and is happily accepted. He then sneaks into Coyle&#x27;s office with Murcott and retrieves the paper that shows that the debt was paid. Asa confronts Coyle and insists that Coyle must pay off Sir Edward&#x27;s other debts, with his doubtless ill-gotten gains, and also apologize to Florence for trying to force her into marriage. He also demands Coyle&#x27;s resignation as the steward of Trenchard Manor, making Murcott steward instead. Murcott is so pleased that he vows to stop drinking. Coyle has no choice but to do all this. Florence marries Harry, Dundreary marries Georgina, and Augusta marries an old beau. Even the servants marry.

==Lincoln assassination==


The play&#x27;s April 14, 1865, performance at Ford&#x27;s Theatre in Washington, D.C., became the most infamous in the play&#x27;s history as the site of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s murder by John Wilkes Booth. The cast modified a line of the play in honor of the president: when the heroine asked for a seat protected from the draft, the replya pun on draft evasion scripted as, &quot;Well, you&#x27;re not the only one that wants to escape the draft&quot;was delivered instead as, &quot;The draft has already been stopped by order of the President!&quot; Halfway through Act III, Scene 2, the character of Asa Trenchard, played that night by Harry Hawk, utters this line, considered one of the play&#x27;s funniest, to Mrs. Mountchessington:


During the ensuing laughter, Booth, a famous actor and Confederate sympathizer who was not part of the play&#x27;s cast, entered Lincoln&#x27;s box and fatally shot him in the back of the head. Familiar with the play, Booth had chosen that moment so that the audience&#x27;s laughter would mask the sound of his gunshot. Booth then leapt from Lincoln&#x27;s box onto the stage and made his escape through the back of the theater to a horse he had left waiting in the alley. That night, the remainder of the play was suspended. Another performance eight days later, for the benefit of the investigation into the killing, was the last performance of any play at Ford&#x27;s Theatre for 103 years. Since reopening, the theatre has not restaged &quot;Our American Cousin&quot;, and has said that it never will.

==Adaptations==
In 1862 Charles Kingsley wrote a parody, the &quot;Great Hippocampus Question&quot;, in the style of Lord Dundreary, and incorporated parts of this in &quot;The Water-Babies&quot; published in 1863.

&quot;Our American Cousin&quot; was adapted for the radio anthology program &quot;On Stage&quot; in 1953. In a move that earned him a rebuke from CBS management, director, producer, and actor Elliott Lewis aired it in the same hour as his show &quot;Crime Classics&quot;&#x27; episode &quot;The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln&quot;.

Eric W. Sawyer&#x27;s 2008 opera &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; presents a fictionalized version of the night of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination from the point of view of the actors in the cast of Taylor&#x27;s play.

<text>The Science Museum Group (SMG) consists of five British museums:

* The Science Museum in South Kensington, London
* The Science and Industry Museum in Manchester
* The Railway Museum in York
* The Locomotion Museum (formerly the National Railway Museum Shildon) in County Durham
* The Science and Media Museum (formerly the National Media Museum and the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television) in Bradford

Items in the SMG collection that are not on display are usually stored at the National Collections Centre in Swindon, Wiltshire.

==History==
The origins of SMG lie in the internationalisation and optimism of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which enabled the foundation of the South Kensington Museum in 1857.

The term &quot;National Museum of Science and Industry&quot; had been in use as the Science Museum&#x27;s subtitle since the early 1920s. Prior to 1 April 2012 the group was known as the National Museum of Science and Industry (NMSI).

The National Science and Media Museum, formerly the National Media Museum, was established by the Science Museum in 1983. The Science Museum was run directly by HM Government until 1984, when the Board of Trustees was established and NMSI was then adopted as a corporate title for the entire organisation. At this point NMSI became a non-departmental public body under the auspices of the sponsoring government department, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

From January 2012 the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester became part of the Science Museum Group.

From 2017 Locomotion, The National Railway Museum at Shildon, became part of the Science Museum Group.

In 2010 the Science Museum, London opened its climate science gallery Atmosphere which, as at April 2021, has been visited by over 5 million people. In 2021 the Science Museum, London also opened a temporary exhibition &#x27;Our Future Planet&#x27; which explores the science of carbon capture. Environmental campaigners criticized the decision of SMG to appoint Shell as a major sponsor of this exhibition.

Throughout 2021 SMG is hosting Climate Talks which are a series of online talks, Q&amp;As and events exploring problems arising from climate change. In October 2021, the SMG announced that a new climate change gallery to be opened in 2023 at the Science Museum would be sponsored by an arm of coal producer Adani Group.

SMG continues to work to reduce carbon emissions from operations, recruitment and supply chain, and by using resources efficiently. On 15 April 2021 SMG announced that it expects to achieve overall Net Zero/Carbon Neutrality by 2033.

==Collection==
The collection includes:
* Alan Turing&#x27;s Pilot ACE computer
* &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;
* Charles Babbage&#x27;s drawing and models

Over 380,000 of the items in the Science Museum Group&#x27;s collections are available to view online at its Search Our Collection web page.

==Chairman and Directors==
The chairman of the group is Sir Tim Laurence who was appointed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on 1st January 2024, succeeding Dame Mary Archer who had served from 2015. 

The following have been directors of the National Museum of Science and Industry, the Science Museum and the Science Museum Group:

<doc id="186350" wikidata="Q57201" url="?curid=186350" title="Michael Wittmann">
<text>Michael Wittmann (22 April 19148 August 1944) was a German Waffen-SS tank commander during the Second World War. He is known for his ambush of elements of the British 7th Armoured Division during the Battle of Villers-Bocage on 13 June 1944. While in command of a Tiger I tank, Wittmann destroyed up to 14 tanks, 15 personnel carriers and two anti-tank guns within 15 minutes before the loss of his own tank.

Wittmann became a cult figure after the war thanks to his accomplishments as a &quot;panzer ace&quot; (a highly decorated tank commander), part of the portrayal of the Waffen-SS in popular culture. Historians have mixed opinions about his tactical performance in battle. Some praised his actions at Villers-Bocage, while many others found his abilities lacking, and the praise for his tank kills overstated.

Although the number is disputed, he is credited with destroying 135 to 138 enemy tanks. German tank kills were recorded as a unit. When he was presented with the &quot;Oak leaves to his Knights Cross&quot; by Hitler on 2 February 1944 his total was 117 tanks.

==Early life and World War II==

Michael Wittmann was born in the village of Vogelthal, near Dietfurt in Bavaria&#x27;s Upper Palatinate, on 22 April 1914. He enlisted in the German Army (&quot;Heer&quot;) in 1934 after the Nazi seizure of power. Wittmann joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) in October 1936 and was assigned to the regiment, later division, Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH) on 5 April 1937. A year later, he participated in the annexation of Austria, the occupation of Sudetenland, and joined the Nazi Party.

===Eastern Front===
Wittmann&#x27;s unit was transferred to the Eastern Front in the spring of 1941 for Operation Barbarossa, the planned invasion of the Soviet Union. He was assigned to SS Panzer Regiment 1, a tank unit, where he commanded a StuG III assault gun/tank destroyer as well as a Panzer III medium tank. By 1943, he commanded a Tiger I tank, and had become a platoon leader in the heavy company by the time Operation Citadel and the Battle of Kursk took place. Attached to the LSSAH, Wittmann&#x27;s platoon of four Tigers reinforced the division&#x27;s reconnaissance battalion to screen the division&#x27;s left flank. On their first day in battle at Kursk, Wittmann and his crew were credited with eight tanks and seven anti-tank guns destroyed. At one point, his tank survived a collision with a burning T-34.

In November 1943, Wittmann, still serving in Leibstandarte’s heavy company, was involved in armored counterattacks against the Russians around Zhitomir. On their first day in action against the Soviets, Wittman’s crew claimed the destruction of ten T-34s and five anti-tank guns. “By early January 1944 his combined total of destroyed tanks would rise to sixty-six.”

On 14 January 1944, Wittmann was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross. The presentation was made by his divisional commander, SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Theodor Wisch, who nominated him for the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves. Wittmann was awarded the Oak Leaves on 30 January for the claimed destruction of 117 tanks, making him the 380th member of the German armed forces to receive it. He received the award from Adolf Hitler, who presented it to him at the Wolf&#x27;s Lair, his headquarters in Rastenburg, on 2 February 1944.

===Normandy===

In April 1944, the LSSAH&#x27;s Tiger Company was transferred to SS Heavy Panzer Battalion 101. This battalion was assigned to the I SS Panzer Corps as a corps asset, and was never permanently attached to any division or regiment. Wittmann was appointed commander of the battalion&#x27;s second company, and held the rank of SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot;. On 7 June, the day after the Allied Invasion of Normandy began, the battalion was ordered to move from Beauvais to Normandy. The move, covering 165 km (105 miles), took five days to complete.

Due to the Anglo-American advance south from Gold and Omaha Beaches, the German 352nd Infantry Division began to buckle. As the division withdrew south, it opened a 12 km (a 7.5-mile) gap in the front line near Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé. Sepp Dietrich, commander of 1st SS Panzer Corps, ordered Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, his only reserve, to position itself behind the Panzer Lehr Division and SS Division Hitlerjugend. From this position, the battalion could protect the developing open left flank. Anticipating the importance the British would assign to the high ground near Villers-Bocage, Wittmann&#x27;s company was positioned near the town. It arrived late on 12 June. Nominally composed of 12 tanks, his company was 50 per cent understrength with only six tanks due to losses and mechanical failures on the hundred-mile road march from the assembly area at Beauvais.
The next morning, lead elements of the British 7th Armoured Division entered Villers-Bocage. Their objective was to exploit the gap in the front line, seize Villers-Bocage, and capture the nearby ridge (Point 213) in an attempt to force a German withdrawal. Wittman had not expected them to arrive so soon and had no time to assemble his company. &quot;Instead I had to act quickly, as I had to assume that the enemy had already spotted me and would destroy me where I stood.&quot; Having ordered the rest of the company to hold its ground, he set off with one tank.
At approximately 09:00, Wittmann&#x27;s Tiger emerged from cover onto the main road, Route Nationale 175, and engaged the rearmost British tanks positioned on Point 213, destroying them. Wittmann then moved towards Villers-Bocage, shooting several unarmed transport vehicles parked along the roadside; the carriers burst into flames as their fuel tanks were ruptured by machine gun and high explosive fire. Moving into the eastern end of the town, he engaged several light tanks, followed by medium tanks. Alerted to Wittmann&#x27;s actions, light tanks in the middle of the town quickly got off the road, while medium tanks were brought forward. Wittmann, meanwhile, had destroyed another British tank and two artillery observation post (OP) tanks, followed by a scout car and a half-track.

Accounts differ slightly as to what happened next. Historians record that, after destroying the OP tanks, Wittmann duelled briefly without success with a Sherman Firefly before withdrawing. His Tiger is then reported to have continued eastwards to the outskirts of the town before being disabled by an anti-tank gun. However, Wittmann said his tank was disabled by an anti-tank gun in the town centre.

In less than 15 minutes, 13 or 14 tanks, two anti-tank guns, and 13 to 15 transport vehicles had been destroyed by Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, the majority or all attributed to Wittmann. He played no further role in the Battle of Villers-Bocage. For his actions during the battle, Wittmann was promoted to SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot;, and awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.

The German propaganda machine swiftly credited Wittmann, by then a household name in Germany, with all the British tanks destroyed at Villers-Bocage. He recorded a radio message on the evening of 13 June, describing the battle and claiming that later counter-attacks had destroyed a British armoured regiment and an infantry battalion. Doctored images were produced; three joined-together photographs, published in the German army magazine &quot;Signal&quot;, gave a false impression of the scale of destruction in the town. The propaganda campaign was given credence in Germany and abroad, leaving the British convinced that the Battle of Villers-Bocage had been a disaster. In fact, its results were less clear-cut. The Waffen-SS may have fought with distinction during the Battle of Kursk but could not match the army&#x27;s success, hence Sepp Dietrich&#x27;s attempts to manufacture a hero out of Wittmann.

===Death===
On 8 August 1944, Anglo-Canadian forces launched Operation Totalize. Under the cover of darkness, British and Canadian tanks and troops seized the tactically important high ground near the town of Saint-Aignan-de-Cramesnil. Here they paused, awaiting an aerial bombardment that would signal the next phase of the attack. Unaware of the reason the Allied forces had halted, SS Hitlerjugend Division Commander Kurt Meyer ordered a counterattack to recapture the high ground.

Wittmann led a group of seven Tiger tanks from Heavy SS-Panzer Battalion 101, supported by additional tanks and infantry. His group of Tigers crossed open terrain towards the high ground. They were ambushed by Allied tanks from two sides. On the right or northeast, British tanks from &quot;A&quot; Squadron 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry and &quot;B&quot; Squadron 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps were positioned in woods. To the left or west, &quot;A&quot; Squadron Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment was located at a chateau courtyard broadside to the attack, where they had knocked firing positions through the stone walls. The attack collapsed as the Canadian tanks destroyed two Tiger tanks, two Panzer IVs and two self-propelled guns in Wittman&#x27;s force, while British tank fire destroyed three other Tigers. During the ambush, anti-tank shells fired from Canadian tanks penetrated the upper hull of Wittmann&#x27;s tank, igniting the ammunition. The resulting fire engulfed the tank and blew off the turret. The destroyed tank&#x27;s dead crew members were buried in an unmarked grave. In 1983, the German war graves commission located the burial site. Wittmann and his crew were reinterred together at the La Cambe German war cemetery in France.

In 2008 a documentary in the &quot;Battlefield Mysteries&quot; series examined the final battle. A historian, Norm Christie, interviewed participants; Rad Walters, Joe Ekins and Ken Tout, and from their testimony and the two German accounts pieced the final battle together. The Tigers left the cover of a hedge near Cintheaux at 12:30 in two prongs; one in the middle of the field with the other—including Wittman—moving more slowly on the right. The British 75mm armed tanks engaged the lead Tiger (Iriohn) hitting it in the transmission, bogies or track and it started going in circles trying to withdraw. Joe Ekins&#x27; tank hit the second Tiger on the right side and knocked it out. As the crew escaped and brought out their wounded, they watched another Tiger north of them go up in flames (Kisters). Iriohn partly withdrew but could not get away and was hit by Ekins—&quot;the one that was mulling around.&quot; Wittmann signalled &quot;Pull back!&quot; He did not realize that a group of the Sherbrookes were immediately to his right, and in a volley they knocked out the two Tigers beside the road. The commander of the second Tiger recalled the position of Wittmann&#x27;s tank and specifically the skewed turret. The tank blew up shortly afterwards. Hans Hoflinger in a following Tiger was also attacked by enfilading fire from Sherman Fireflies with powerful 17-pound guns, and had to abandon his tank. He saw the fire and explosion in Wittmann&#x27;s tank, and that the turret was displaced to the right and tilted down to the front somewhat. None of his crew had gotten out. Survivors from Dollinger&#x27;s tank passed by the wreck of Wittmann&#x27;s tank shortly afterwards. 
In more recent years the 2008 Battlefield Mysteries documentary has been criticized on grounds of inaccuracy and standard of proof. It is largely based on the postulations put forward by Canadian writer Brian Reid&#x27;s unsubstantiated claims made in 2005. Much of the show is based on speculation and is at odds with the first Investigation conducted by &quot;After the Battle&quot; military magazine published in 1985. It was &quot;After The Battle&quot; that were the first to investigate Wittmann&#x27;s death and had documentary evidence from the War Diary of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry. This only mentions 3 Tigers in the field, numbers 312, 007 and 314 and it does not mention the Sherbrooke Fusiliers who were supposed to be across the field. In a battle this would have been reported.

====Speculation surrounding death====
For such a junior officer, an unusual amount of speculation has surrounded Wittmann&#x27;s death, both as to its cause and the party responsible. Agte states that „the English” could have possibly placed a bounty on him. This is contradicted by Allied records and the testimony of Allied troops involved that he was not singled out during the battle.

After the war, claims were made by or for the following units as being responsible for Wittmann&#x27;s death: the 1st Polish Armoured Division, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the 144th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, and the RAF Second Tactical Air Force.

Nazi propaganda reported that Allied aircraft struck Wittmann&#x27;s tank, stating that he had fallen in combat to the „dreaded fighter-bombers”. In a post-war account, French civilian Serge Varin, who took the only known photograph of the destroyed tank, claimed that he found an unexploded rocket nearby and that he saw no other penetration holes in the tank. Historian Brian Reid dismisses this contention as relevant RAF logs make no claim of engaging tanks in the area at that time. This position is supported by the men of Wittmann&#x27;s unit who stated they did not come under air attack, and by British and Canadian tank crews who also dismissed any involvement by aircraft.

Prompted by the discovery of Wittmann&#x27;s remains in 1983 interest in his death was back in the news. In a 1985 issue of &quot;After the Battle Magazine&quot;, Les Taylor, a wartime member of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry, claimed that fellow yeoman Joe Ekins was responsible for the destruction of Wittmann&#x27;s tank. Veteran and historian Ken Tout, a member of the same unit, published a similar account crediting Ekins. This became the widely accepted version of events. According to Hart, Ekins&#x27;s unit was positioned in a wood on the right flank of the advancing Tiger tanks. At approximately 12:47, they engaged them, halting the attack, and killing Wittmann. The turret numbers of the three Tigers were recorded after the battle in the unit War Diary: 312, 007 and 314. Wittman&#x27;s tank was 007. Pictures of these tanks and their positions were confirmed in photographs taken by French locals and made available to the investigation. These were taken after the war before the tanks were removed for scrap. Brian Reid&#x27;s account is based on the 1985 &quot;ATB&quot; investigation but with changes, 5 Tigers instead of 3, the position of Tiger 007 and the position of the Sherbrook Fusiliers. There is no documentation to support any of Reid&#x27;s claims.

Reid postulated the possibility that A Squadron of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade, positioned on the left flank of the advancing German tanks, was responsible instead. Commanded by Sydney Valpy Radley-Walters, the squadron&#x27;s six 75 mm Shermans and two 17-pounder Sherman Fireflies were situated on the grounds of a chateau at Gaumesnil. The unit had created firing holes in the property&#x27;s walls and, based on verbal testimony, engaged the advancing German tanks, including Tigers. The British tanks were between and away from the German line of advance, whereas the Canadian squadron was less than 150 m (500 feet) away behind a stone wall. Reid argues that due to the Canadians&#x27; proximity to the Germans, and the firing angle which precisely coincides with the tank round&#x27;s entry hole in the Tiger, their troops more than likely destroyed Wittmann&#x27;s tank. Reid supports this with H. Holfinger&#x27;s account of the engagement. Holfinger was in a Tiger approximately behind Wittmann and he said Wittmann&#x27;s Tiger was destroyed at 12:55. Ekins&#x27;s crew was credited with the destruction of 3 Tigers at 12:40, 12:47 and 12:52, Wittmann&#x27;s tank being allegedly the one destroyed at 12:47. Considering Holfinger&#x27;s account, Reid concludes that the Tiger destroyed at 12:47 could not be that of Wittmann; he also notes that the circumstances surrounding the fate of the Tiger destroyed at 12:52 exclude the possibility that it could have been Wittmann&#x27;s. Reid&#x27;s account of the battle has also come under scrutiny as being speculation, offering no actual proof of the events. He does accept that the documented claims of the 1st Northamptonshire Yeomanry are correct. Though there are discrepancies with the 1985 investigation with regard to other other details such as the position of Wittmanns tank.

===Assessment as a tank commander===

Some historians and authors of the late twentieth-century found Wittmann&#x27;s actions at Villers-Bocage impressive, describing his attack as &quot;one of the most amazing engagements in the history of armoured warfare&quot; (Hastings), &quot;one of the most devastating single-handed actions of the war&quot; (D&#x27;Este), and &quot;one of the most devastating ambushes in British military history&quot; (Beevor). Historian Stephen Badsey has stated that the ambush Wittmann launched has cast a shadow over the period between D-Day and 13 June in historical accounts.

With an unverified record of 130 tanks destroyed, Wittmann has been credited as being the top tank ace of the war. Others have noted Wittmann may have been Germany&#x27;s top tank ace, although Kurt Knispel might have surpassed his tally.

Jim Storr, writing in &quot;The Human Face of War&quot;, notes that Wittman&#x27;s attack on the British regiment at Bocage went beyond just a bad day of tanks losses for the British. He claims that the shock of losses to the British regiment had operational and strategic effect for the operation. Trigg says that in twenty or so minutes, Wittmann and his Tiger basically ended Operation Perch.

With his action in particular at Villers Bocage, A.D. Harvey, writing in &quot;Military History&quot;, compared him to Sergeant Alvin York, the famed American soldier of the First World War; both single-handedly destroyed large amounts of the enemy. Harvey noted that with a total of 138 tanks and 132 armoured vehicles destroyed, this tally made him the most successful tank commander in military history.

German tank commander and historian is not as impressed. In analyzing Wittmann&#x27;s actions at Villers-Bocage, he called into question his tactical ability. Schneider states: &quot;a competent tank company commander does not accumulate so many serious mistakes&quot;. He highlights how Wittmann gathered his forces in a sunken lane with a broken-down tank at the head of the column, thereby hampering his unit&#x27;s mobility. The solitary advance into Villers-Bocage was heavily criticized as it breached &quot;all the rules&quot;. No intelligence was obtained, and there was no &quot;centre of gravity&quot; or &quot;concentration of forces&quot; in the attack. Schneider argues that due to Wittmann&#x27;s rash actions: &quot;the bulk of the 2nd Company and Mobius 1st Company came up against an enemy who had gone onto the defensive&quot;. He calls Wittmann&#x27;s &quot;carefree&quot; advance into British-occupied positions &quot;pure folly&quot;, and says &quot;such over hastiness was uncalled for.&quot; He concludes that had a properly prepared assault been launched involving the rest of his company, and the 1st Company, far greater results could have been achieved. Finally, Schneider opines that: &quot;thoughtlessness of this kind was to cost [Wittmann] his life ... during an attack casually launched in open country with an exposed flank.&quot;

Historian Sönke Neitzel describes Wittmann as the &quot;supposedly successful&quot; tank commander of World War II and attests to &quot;hero worshipping&quot; around Wittmann. According to Neitzel, numbers of successes, by highly decorated tank commanders, should be read with caution as it is rarely possible to determine reliably, in the heat of battle, how many tanks were destroyed by whom.

Historian Steven Zaloga credits Wittmann with around 135 tank kills and points out that he achieved 120 of these in 1943, operating a Tiger I tank on the Eastern Front. Having advantages both in firepower and in armor, the Tiger I was &quot;nearly invulnerable in a frontal engagement&quot; against any of the Soviet tanks of that time, and Wittmann thus could destroy opposing tanks from a safe distance. Zaloga concludes that &quot;Most of the &#x27;tank aces&#x27; of World War II were simply lucky enough to have an invulnerable tank with a powerful gun.&quot; German documents from 1944 state that Allied technology had caught up with the Tiger I and &quot;no longer can it prance around, oblivious to the laws of tank tactics&quot;. Zaloga believes that Wittmann&#x27;s fate reflected that new reality: after his transfer to France, his crew only lasted two months, and was destroyed either by a British medium tank, the up-gunned Sherman Firefly, or a standard 75mm-equipped Sherman. The 75mm&#x27;s armour piercing round was more than enough to have penetrated his Tiger&#x27;s thin rear upper deck armour from less than 150 m (500 feet) and all of the Sherbrooke-Fusilier&#x27;s records were lost shortly after the battle when an American aircraft negligently bombed the vehicle that contained these documents. There is therefore there is no documented record for the claims of the Sherbrooke Fusiliers and so must be treated with caution.

Writing in 2013, British historian John Buckley criticised the accounts which many historians continue to provide of the fighting around Villers-Bocage. Buckley argued that by wrongly attributing the entire German success to Wittmann, &quot;many historians through to today continue to repackage unquestioningly Nazi propaganda&quot;. The British lost 22 Cromwell and Stuart tanks at the battle of Villers Bocage. But a British counter attack later in the day ended with the destruction of five Tiger I tanks and up to eight Panzer IV tanks.

==In popular culture==
Wittmann is often featured in books on the battles in Normandy. Several websites are dedicated to him, along with books by authors such as Patrick Agte and Franz Kurowski. The former is an author and publisher affiliated with the pro-Waffen-SS revisionist history group HIAG, while the latter is a prolific author who lauded decorated Waffen-SS men.

===Cult status===
Wittmann became a cult figure after the war thanks to his accomplishments as a &quot;panzer ace&quot; (a highly decorated tank commander) in the portrayal of the Waffen-SS in popular culture. Historian Stephen Hart said that &quot;the Wittmann legend [has] become well-established&quot; and &quot;continues to stimulate huge public interest&quot;. Military historian Steven Zaloga refers to Wittmann as &quot;the hero of all Nazi fanboys&quot;. He discusses the popular perception of a tank-versus-tank engagement as an &quot;armoured joust&quot;—two opponents facing each other—with the &quot;more valiant or better-armed the eventual victor&quot;. Zaloga contends that the perception is nothing but &quot;romantic nonsense&quot;. According to him, most successful tank commanders were &quot;bushwhackers&quot;, having a battlefield advantage rather than a technical one: a tank crew that could engage its opponent before the latter spotted it often came out on top.

Wittmann is featured by Kurowski in his 1992 book &quot;Panzer Aces&quot;, an ahistorical and hagiographic account of the combat careers of highly decorated Nazi tank commanders. Smelser and Davies describe Kurowski&#x27;s version of the war on the Eastern Front as &quot;well-nigh chivalrous&quot;, with German troops &quot;showing concerns for the Russian wounded, despite the many atrocities&quot; of the Soviets against the Germans. In one of Kurowski&#x27;s accounts, Wittmann takes out eighteen tanks in a single engagement, for which Sepp Dietrich, the commanding officer, presents him with an Iron Cross and inquires whether Wittmann has a request. Without hesitation, Wittmann asks for assistance for a wounded Russian soldier he has spotted. Many similar acts of &quot;humanity&quot; are present in the book, amounting to a distorted image of the German fighting men.

<doc id="186351" wikidata="Q2994473" url="?curid=186351" title="In-situ conservation">
<text>In-situ conservation is the on-site conservation or the conservation of genetic resources in natural populations of plant or animal species, such as forest genetic resources in natural populations of tree species. This process protects the inhabitants and ensures the sustainability of the environment and ecosystem.

Its converse is ex situ conservation, where threatened species are moved to another location. These can include places like seed libraries, gene banks and more where they are protected through human intervention.

==Methods==
===Nature reserves===

Nature reserves (or biosphere reserves) cover very large areas, often more than 5000 km2. They are used to protect species for a long time. There are 3 different classifications for these reserves: 

* Strict Natural Areas
* Managed Natural Areas
* Wilderness Areas

Strict natural areas are creates to protect the state of nature in a given region. It is not made for the purpose of protecting any species within its limits. managed natural areas alternatively are made specifically for the purpose of protecting a certain species or community that is at the point it may be at risk being in a strict natural area. This is a more controlled environment that is created to be the most optimal habitat for the species concerned to thrive. Finally, a wilderness area serves a dual purpose of providing a protection for the natural region as well as providing recreational opportunities for patrons (excluding motorized transport) 

===National parks===
A national park is an area dedicated for the conservation of wildlife along with its environment. A national park is an area which is used to conserve scenery, natural and historical objects. It is usually a small reserve covering an area of about 100 to 500 square kilometers. Within biosphere reserves, one or more national parks may also exist. 

===Wildlife sanctuaries===
Wildlife sanctuaries can provide a higher quality of life for animals who are moved there. These animals are placed in specialized habitats that allows for more species-specific behaviors to take place. Wildlife sanctuaries are often used for animals that have been in zoos, circuses, laboratories and more for a long time, and then live the rest of their lives with greater autonomy in these habitats. 

===Biodiversity hotspots===

Several international organizations focus their conservation work on areas designated as biodiversity hotspots. 

According to Conservation International, to qualify as a biodiversity hotspot a region must meet two strict criteria:
* it must contain at least 1,500 species of vascular plants (∆ 0.5% of the world&#x27;s total) as endemics,
* it has to have lost at least 70% of its original habitat.
Biodiversity hotspots make up 1.4% of the earth&#x27;s land area, yet they contain more than half of our planets species.

===Gene sanctuary===
A gene sanctuary is an area where plants are conserved. It includes both biosphere reserves as well as national parks. Biosphere reserves are developed to be both a place for biodiversity conservation as well as sustainable development. The concept was first developed in the 1970s and include a core, buffer and transition zones. These zones act together to harmonize the conservation and development aspects of the biosphere. 

Since 2004, and 30 years following the invention of the biosphere reserve concept, there have been about 459 conservation areas developed in 97 countries.

==Benefits==
One benefit of &quot;in situ&quot; conservation is that it maintains recovering populations in the environment where they have developed their distinctive properties. Another benefit is that this strategy helps ensure the ongoing processes of evolution and adaptation within their environments. As a last resort, &quot;ex situ&quot; conservation may be used on some or all of the population, when &quot;in situ&quot; conservation is too difficult, or impossible. The species gets adjusted to the natural disasters like drought, floods, forest fires and this method is very cheap and convenient.

==Reserves==
Wildlife and livestock conservation involves the protection of wildlife habitats. Sufficiently large reserves must be maintained to enable the target species to exist in large numbers. The population size must be sufficient to enable the necessary genetic diversity to survive, so that it has a good chance of continuing to adapt and evolve over time. This reserve size can be calculated for target species by examining the population density in naturally occurring situations. The reserves must then be protected from intrusion or destruction by man, and against other catastrophes.

==Agriculture==
In agriculture, &quot;in situ&quot; conservation techniques are an effective way to improve, maintain, and use traditional or native varieties of agricultural crops. Such methodologies link the positive output of scientific research with farmers&#x27; experience and field work.

First, the accessions of a variety stored at a germplasm bank and those of the same variety multiplied by farmers are jointly tested in the producers field and in the laboratory, under different situations and stresses. Thus, the scientific knowledge about the production characteristics of the native varieties is enhanced. Later, the best tested accessions are crossed, mixed, and multiplied under replicable situations. At last, these improved accessions are supplied to the producers. Thus, farmers are enabled to crop improved selections of their own varieties, instead of being lured to substitute their own varieties with commercial ones or to abandon their crop. This technique of conservation of agricultural biodiversity is more successful in marginal areas, where commercial varieties are not expedient, due to climate and soil fertility constraints, or where the taste and cooking characteristics of traditional varieties compensate for their lower yields.

==In India==
About 4% of the total geographical area of India is used for &quot;in situ&quot; conservation.

There are 18 biosphere reserves in India, including Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand, Nokrek in Meghalaya, Manas National Park in Assam and Sundarban in West Bengal.

There are 106 national parks in India, including The Kaziranga National Park which conserves The one-horned rhino, Periyar National Park conserving the tiger and elephant, and Ranthambore National Park conserving the tiger.

There are 551 wildlife sanctuaries in India.

Biodiversity hotspots include the Himalayas, the Western Ghats, the Indo-Burma region and the Sundaland.

India has set up its first gene sanctuary in the Garo Hills of Meghalaya for wild relatives of citrus. Efforts are also being made to set up gene sanctuaries for banana, sugarcane, rice and mango.

Community reserves were established as a type of protected area in India in the Wildlife Protection Amendment Act 2002, to provide legal support to community or privately owned reserves which cannot be designated as national park or wildlife sanctuary.

Sacred groves are tracts of forest set aside where all the trees and wildlife within are venerated and given total protection.

== In China ==
China has up to 2538 nature reserves covering 15% of the country.

The majority of &quot;in situ&quot; conservation areas are concentrated in the regions of Tibet, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. These provinces, all in western China, account for about 56% of the country&#x27;s nature reserves.

Eastern and southern China contain 90% of the country&#x27;s population, and there are few nature reserves in these areas. In these regions, nature reserves actively compete with human development projects to support a growing demand for infrastructure. One consequence of this competing development has been the movement of the South China tiger out of its natural habitat.

In eastern and southern China, many undeveloped natural landscapes are fragmented; however, nature reserves may provide crucial refuge for key species and ecosystem services.

<doc id="186352" wikidata="Q320281" url="?curid=186352" title="Kerry Wendell Thornley">
<text>Kerry Wendell Thornley (April 17, 1938 – November 28, 1998) was an American author. He is known as the co-founder (along with childhood friend Greg Hill) of Discordianism, in which context he is usually known as Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst or simply Lord Omar. He and Hill authored the religion&#x27;s text &quot;Principia Discordia, Or, How I Found Goddess, and What I Did to Her When I Found Her.&quot; Thornley also was known for his 1962 manuscript &quot;The Idle Warriors&quot;, which was inspired by the activities of his acquaintance Lee Harvey Oswald before the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy.

Thornley was highly active in the countercultural publishing scene, writing for a number of underground magazines and newspapers, and self-publishing many one-page (or &quot;broadsheet&quot;) newsletters of his own. One such newsletter called &quot;Zenarchy&quot; was published in the 1960s under the pen name Ho Chi Zen. Zenarchy is described in the introduction of the collected volume as &quot;the social order which springs from meditation&quot;, and &quot;A noncombative, nonparticipatory, no-politics approach to anarchy intended to get the serious student thinking.&quot;

Raised Mormon, in adulthood Kerry shifted his ideological focus frequently, in rivalry with any serious countercultural figure of the 1960s. Among the subjects he closely scrutinized throughout his life were atheism, anarchism, Objectivism, autarchism (he attended Robert LeFevre&#x27;s Freedom School), neo-paganism, Kerista, Buddhism, and the memetic inheritor of Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius.

==Personal life==
Kerry Wendell Thornley was born on April 17, 1938, in Los Angeles to Kenneth and Helen Thornley. He had two younger brothers, Dick and Tom.

Thornley attended California High School in Whittier, California.

On Saturday, December 11, 1965, Kerry married Cara Leach at Wayfarers Chapel in Palos Verdes, California. They had one son, Kreg Thornley, born in 1969. They later divorced. Kreg was a photographer, painter, musician and film maker.

==Military life==
Having already been a reservist in the U.S. Marine Corps for about two years, Thornley had been summoned to active duty in 1958 at age 20, soon after completing his freshman year at the University of Southern California. According to &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, it was around this time that he and Greg Hill—alias Malaclypse the Younger or Mal-2—shared their first Eristic vision in a bowling alley in their hometown of Whittier, California.

In early 1959, Thornley served for a short time in the same radar operator unit as Lee Harvey Oswald at MCAS El Toro in Santa Ana, California. Both men had shared a common interest in society, culture, literature and politics, and whenever duty placed them together, had discussed such topics as George Orwell&#x27;s famous novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and the philosophy of Marxism, particularly Oswald&#x27;s interest in the latter.

While aboard a troopship returning to the United States from duty in Japan (some time after the two men parted ways as a result of routine reassignment), Thornley read of Oswald&#x27;s autumn 1959 defection to the Soviet Union in the U.S. military newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot;.

==1960s==

In February 1962, Thornley completed &quot;The Idle Warriors,&quot; which has the historical distinction of being the only book written about Lee Harvey Oswald &quot;before&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s assassination in 1963. Due to the serendipitous nature of Thornley&#x27;s choice of literary subject matter, he was called to testify before the Warren Commission in Washington, D.C., on May 18, 1964. The Commission subpoenaed a copy of the manuscript and stored it in the National Archives, and the book remained unpublished until 1991. In 1965, Thornley published another book titled &quot;Oswald&quot;, generally defending the &quot;Oswald-as-lone-assassin&quot; conclusion of the Warren Commission.

In January 1968, New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison, certain there had been a New Orleans–based conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, subpoenaed Thornley to appear before a grand jury, questioning him about his relationship with Oswald and his knowledge of other figures Garrison believed to be connected to the assassination. Thornley sought a cancellation of this subpoena on which he had to appear before the Circuit Court. Garrison charged Thornley with perjury after Thornley denied that he had been in contact with Oswald in any manner since 1959. The perjury charge was eventually dropped by Garrison&#x27;s successor Harry Connick Sr.

Thornley claimed that, during his initial two-year sojourn in New Orleans, he had numerous meetings with two mysterious middle-aged men named &quot;Gary Kirstein&quot; and &quot;Slim Brooks&quot;. According to his account, they had detailed discussions on numerous subjects ranging from the mundane to the exotic, and bordering sometimes on bizarre. Among these was the subject of how one might assassinate President Kennedy, whose beliefs and policies the aspiring novelist deeply disliked at the time. Later, the former Marine came to believe that &quot;Gary Kirstein&quot; had in reality been senior CIA officer and future Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt, and &quot;Slim Brooks&quot; to have been Jerry Milton Brooks, a member of the 1960s right-wing activist group The Minutemen. Guy Banister, another Minutemen member in New Orleans, had been accused by Garrison of involvement in the assassination and was allegedly connected to Lee Harvey Oswald through the Fair Play for Cuba Committee leaflet. Thornley also claimed that &quot;Kirstein&quot; and Brooks had accurately predicted Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s accession to the presidency six years before it happened, as well as anticipating the rise of the 1960s counterculture and the subsequent emergence of Charles Manson and what became his cult following. This led Thornley to believe that the US government had somehow been involved, directly or indirectly, in creating and/or supporting these events, personages and phenomena.

After Shaw was acquitted, Thornley said he wanted Garrison to bring him to trial in order to clear his name.

==Later life and death==
For the next 30 years, Thornley traveled and lived all over the United States and was involved in a variety of activities, ranging from editing underground newspapers to attending graduate school. He spent most of the remainder of his life in the Little Five Points neighborhood of Atlanta. During this time, he maintained a free series of fliers titled &quot;Out of Order.&quot; This single page, double sided Xeroxed periodical was distributed in the Little Five Points area. 
Thornley became increasingly paranoid and distrustful in the wake of his experiences during the 1960s, both by his own accounts and those of personal acquaintances. For a time, Thornley wrote a regular column in the zine &quot;Factsheet Five&quot; until editor Mike Gunderloy stopped publishing the magazine. Struggling with illness in his final days, Kerry Thornley died of cardiac arrest in Atlanta on November 28, 1998, at the age of 60. The following morning, 23 people attended a Buddhist memorial service in his honor. His body had been cremated, and the ashes scattered over the Pacific Ocean. Shortly before his death, Thornley reportedly said he&#x27;d felt &quot;like a tired child home from a very wild circus&quot;, a reference to a passage by Greg Hill from &quot;Principia Discordia:&quot;

<doc id="186353" wikidata="Q1410055" url="?curid=186353" title="Yazoo (band)">
<text>Yazoo (known as Yaz in North America) were an English synth-pop duo from Basildon, Essex, consisting of former Depeche Mode member Vince Clarke (keyboards) and Alison Moyet (vocals). The duo formed in late 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement Moyet placed in a British music magazine.

Over the next 18 months the duo released two albums, &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;You and Me Both&quot;, which received critical acclaim for their production, particularly the blending of Clarke&#x27;s synthesizer melodies with Moyet&#x27;s blues- and soul-influenced vocals. 

Yazoo enjoyed worldwide success, but were particularly popular in their home country, where three of their four singles reached the top three of the UK Singles Chart and both their albums made the top two of the UK Albums Chart. In North America, they are known for the song &quot;Situation&quot;, which, though originally only a B-side in the United Kingdom, was a club and airplay success in the United States and Canada before being released as the band&#x27;s debut single in North America.

Despite their success, the duo split acrimoniously in May 1983 as a result of a combination of Clarke&#x27;s reluctance to make more records under the Yazoo name, a clash of personalities, and a lack of communication between the pair. 

Clarke went on to form Erasure, another successful and longer-lasting synth-pop duo, while Moyet embarked on a highly successful solo career. Although their musical career was short, Yazoo&#x27;s combination of electronic instrumentation and soulful female vocals has been cited as an influence on the house music scene that emerged in the mid-1980s, as well as on bands such as LCD Soundsystem (who name-checked the duo on their debut single &quot;Losing My Edge&quot;), Hercules and Love Affair (whose leader Andy Butler has said that &quot;Situation&quot; was his biggest musical inspiration as a child), La Roux, Shiny Toy Guns and Blaqk Audio.

In 2008, 25 years after splitting, Clarke and Moyet reconciled and reformed Yazoo to play a successful tour of the UK, Europe and North America in support of the reissue of Yazoo&#x27;s two studio albums and a box set of their material titled &quot;In Your Room&quot;. The pair briefly reunited in May 2011 to play three Yazoo songs at a music festival organised by their record label.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; (1982)===
Clarke and Moyet grew up in Basildon and attended the same Saturday music school when they were eleven years old. Clarke was inspired to make electronic music after hearing Wirral synth-pop group Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD): he became co-founder and original bandleader of Depeche Mode, who in 1981 released an album and three Clarke-penned singles through Mute Records. Moyet spent her teens singing in various punk and blues bands in her home town. She placed an advert in the UK weekly music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in late 1981 asking for musicians to form a &quot;rootsy&quot; blues band after her most recent group, the Screamin&#x27; Ab Dabs, had broken up.

Moyet was surprised when the only reply she received was from Clarke, who had recently stunned the music press by quitting Depeche Mode. Despite growing up nearby, Moyet and Clarke did not know each other. Moyet had been in the same class at school as Clarke&#x27;s future Depeche Mode bandmates Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher but had no contact with Clarke himself, remembering him as an outsider who, with his brothers, would wear t-shirts proclaiming their Christianity. Clarke had seen Moyet sing live a few times, as his best friend had been in her punk band.

Clarke wanted to maintain his relationship with Mute, saying in a 2008 interview, &quot;When I left Depeche I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d still have a record deal and was keen to play the label something of my own, so I wrote the song &#x27;Only You&#x27; but needed someone to demo it with. Alison happened to be advertising in a local paper so I called her.&quot; With Moyet now on board, Clarke opted for a &quot;duo&quot; configuration inspired by the likes of OMD and Soft Cell.

The pair came to the project with different tastes in music. In an early interview, Moyet stated that &quot;I&#x27;m a traditionalist, I can&#x27;t accept the fact of blues with synthesizers at all,&quot; while Clarke admitted to tolerating modern R&amp;B outfits like Dr. Feelgood but disliked traditional blues artists such as Muddy Waters. Clarke took the &quot;Only You&quot; demo to Mute label boss Daniel Miller but recalled that at first Miller appeared to be uninterested: &quot;I tried to give it to Daniel and he didn&#x27;t show much interest ... I brought it in and put it on, and the whole time it was playing, Daniel was messing around with a synthesizer. He said he liked it, but carried on doing what he was doing—and that was it. Only when the publishers took an interest did he brighten up.&quot; Mute asked the duo to record the song as a single and to make an album together. By this point Clarke had already written &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, but both he and Moyet felt it was too good to be the B-side of &quot;Only You&quot;, so they quickly wrote the song &quot;Situation&quot; together for the single&#x27;s B-side.

According to Moyet, the name Yazoo was taken from the specialist blues record label Yazoo Records. 
This decision led to a £3.5 million lawsuit threat by the label over the band&#x27;s name and, coupled with the fact that the name Yazoo was already in use by a lesser known American rock band, the group was renamed Yaz for the North American market.

&quot;Only You&quot; was released in the UK in March 1982 and rose to number two on the UK singles chart. The duo recorded their debut album at Blackwing Studios in southeast London, where Clarke had recorded Depeche Mode&#x27;s album &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; the previous year. As the studio had already been booked during the day by fellow Mute artist Fad Gadget, Yazoo recorded most of the album during the early mornings. Clarke had expected that Miller would produce the album, but discovered that Miller was already otherwise occupied, so Blackwing studio owner Eric Radcliffe carried out production duties with Clarke and Moyet. The album was named &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; in recognition of Radcliffe&#x27;s input.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot; was released in July 1982 as the second single in the UK and also reached the top three of the UK charts. In North America, &quot;Situation&quot; had been a hit in the clubs in a version remixed by New York City-based DJ François Kevorkian, and against the band&#x27;s wishes, it was released as Yazoo&#x27;s debut single in the US and Canada, where it reached number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Only You&quot; was released as Yazoo&#x27;s second single in North America and reached number 67.

&quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; was released in the UK in August 1982, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart and going on to sell more than 300,000 copies and achieving platinum status. In the US, initial success was more modest and the album peaked at number 92 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, but by 1989, seven years after its release, word of mouth had helped to push the album to platinum status for sales of over one million copies. The duo played 24 dates in support of the album across Europe and North America.

===&quot;You and Me Both&quot; and disbandment (1983)===
After releasing &quot;The Other Side of Love&quot; in the UK in November 1982, a non-album stopgap single that reached number 13 in the UK singles chart, the duo went back to Blackwing to record their second album. However, by now there was growing tension between the pair. Clarke had always seen &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; as a one-off project and had to be persuaded to make another Yazoo record by his publishers, who felt it would not go down well if he was seen to walk out of a second band within a year of the first. Compounding this were issues of self-esteem for Moyet. At only 21 years of age, she was struggling to come to terms with being in the spotlight and the pressures of sudden fame, and she resented the fact that Clarke was leaving her to carry out all the promotional work for the records by herself. Unlike their first record, the second album was made over a longer period of four months and with Clarke and Moyet rarely in the studio together at the same time; Clarke would record instrumental tracks in the morning and Moyet would come in during the evening and record her vocals.

A single, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Diary&quot;, was released in May 1983 ahead of the album and reached number three in the UK chart, but within days of the single&#x27;s release, Yazoo announced that they were splitting up. The album, ironically titled &quot;You and Me Both&quot;, was released in the UK in July 1983 and topped the UK album charts, a feat it would also achieve in New Zealand. However, with no further singles or live appearances to promote it, it did not sell as well as &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot;, although it still achieved gold status in the UK for sales of 100,000 copies. In the US, &quot;You and Me Both&quot; peaked at number 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Reflecting in 2008 on the group&#x27;s split, both Moyet and Clarke agreed that a lack of communication between the pair had been a major reason for the breakdown of the partnership. Moyet recalled that Clarke &quot;was creatively very encouraging, very open to hearing my ideas for songs. The thing I found difficult was the lack of warmth. I wanted to feel more likeable, and you can&#x27;t feel likeable if someone doesn&#x27;t want to interact with you.&quot; Clarke admitted that &quot;I lacked the life-skills of communication in a relationship. I felt confident in the studio, but starting a chat with somebody ...&quot; He put it down to the fact that because the duo became popular so rapidly, there had never been any time to build up a personal relationship between them: &quot;It all happened very fast and because we hadn&#x27;t been in a band for years, playing in clubs, it was very much just a working relationship—we never had the chance to bond. We never really knew each other. Not really ... The fact that we never talked, never socialised together, meant that when problems came up we didn&#x27;t know how to communicate and sort things out.&quot; Moyet added that their differing personalities had not helped matters, saying, &quot;He was, I think, sad at the time after leaving Depeche and remote, a bit angry, but it was all internalised. Whereas I was this disaffected, slightly aggressive ex-punk rocker where nothing was internalised. I was probably quite difficult to be around.&quot;

===Legacy===
Following Yazoo&#x27;s split, Clarke formed the Assembly with Eric Radcliffe. Intending to record a series of one-off singles featuring different vocalists, in the end the Assembly produced just one single, &quot;Never Never&quot; with Feargal Sharkey, before also splitting up. Around this time, Clarke also produced the album &quot;The Peter Pan Effect&quot; for singer Robert Marlow, an old friend of both his and Moyet&#x27;s. Clarke then teamed up with singer Andy Bell to form the successful synth-pop duo Erasure. Moyet spent several months out of the limelight before signing a deal with CBS Records and embarking on a successful solo career.

&quot;Situation&quot; was finally released as a single in the UK in 1990 in another remixed form, which was moderately successful, reaching number 14 on the UK singles chart. A compilation entitled &quot;Only Yazoo: The Best of&quot; was released in 1999 and was preceded by a re-release of Yazoo&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Only You&quot;, featuring a new remix of the title track and several more of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. The band&#x27;s output was book-ended with yet another release of &quot;Situation&quot;, accompanied by many remixes. Clarke was chosen to remix Moyet&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Whispering Your Name&quot; and, with Erasure, Clarke and Moyet tried to record her single &quot;This House&quot; as a duet, but the project never happened because Sony Music would not permit it.

The band&#x27;s songs have appeared in a number of films and television shows. In 1988, &quot;In My Room&quot;, &quot;Ode to Boy&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot; were used in the film &quot;The Chocolate War&quot; (an adaption of the book of the same title). &quot;Only You&quot; was used in the film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;, the BBC television series &quot;The Office&quot;, the film &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait&quot;, the &quot;Fringe&quot; episode &quot;Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot; episode &quot;Dimebag&quot; and several episodes of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; [Season 5]. A cover version of &quot;Only You&quot; by Joshua Radin was used in 2007 in a J. C. Penney commercial. Another cover of &quot;Only You&quot; was recorded by Selena Gomez for the 2017 Netflix television show &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot; appeared in the BBC series &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; and was used in the film &quot;Tango and Cash&quot;. The song &quot;Situation&quot; was used in the 1990 TV movie &quot;Exile&quot; and was also used in a Nintendo commercial highlighting the classic edition of the Game Boy Advance SP and the NES games ported to it. In 2007, &quot;Bring Your Love Down (Didn&#x27;t I)&quot; was used in &quot;The Sarah Silverman Program&quot; episode &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;.

Anohni, lead vocalist of Antony &amp; the Johnsons, talked with Terry Gross in February 2009 about recording the debut self-titled Hercules and Love Affair album. She said she had been asked by New York-based DJ Andy Butler to join the project and that the objective was (or became) &quot;Let&#x27;s sound as much like Yazoo as we can ... We loved Yazoo.&quot;

===2008 reunion and &#x27;Reconnected&#x27; tour===

Despite the long estrangement, Moyet had always harboured plans to perform the songs from &quot;You and Me Both&quot; live on stage, something that had never occurred, as the duo had split before the album was released. Toward the end of 2007, she had finished promoting her album &quot;The Turn&quot; and had no immediate plans for more solo work, and aware that Mute were planning to issue remastered versions of Yazoo&#x27;s albums, she e-mailed Clarke to see if he was interested in the idea of a reunion. 

Clarke welcomed her message, but replied that he was now committed to his current band Erasure and felt it would be disloyal to his musical partner Andy Bell if he returned to work with Moyet. However, shortly afterwards Bell told Clarke that he wanted to take a break from Erasure, causing Clarke to reconsider Moyet&#x27;s proposal, and with a message sent via Mute label head Daniel Miller, he indicated that he was open to reuniting for live performances. Clarke disclosed that he had felt obliged to ask Bell if he had any objections to Clarke performing with Yazoo again: Bell&#x27;s response had simply been to ask Clarke for tickets for the reunion shows.

The first public indication that Yazoo was being revived was on 11 December 2007 when Erasure&#x27;s website announced that an official Yazoo website and Myspace page were being set up. On 13 December, the Planet Sound music magazine pages on the UK&#x27;s Teletext service on Channel 4 exclusively revealed that both Yazoo albums were to be reissued and that the duo were planning to reform and play a gig in support of the albums&#x27; release. 

On 20 January 2008, the new official Yazoo website confirmed that Clarke and Moyet would be reuniting to play five concerts across the UK in June 2008, preceded by a four-disc box set entitled &quot;In Your Room&quot;, which would feature remastered stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes of the albums &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;You and Me Both&quot;, a disc of B-sides and remixes and a DVD including new interviews with Clarke and Moyet and the videos for their five UK and US singles, along with video footage of television performances from 1982 and 1983. Two EPs available on vinyl and as digital downloads were released to coincide with the box set, the &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Diary EP&quot; released on 12 May 2008 featuring various remixes of the song (including one by Erasure&#x27;s Andy Bell) and the &quot;Reconnected&quot; EP released on 9 June 2008, which featured various Yazoo tracks remixed by different artists.

Having re-established contact, Clarke and Moyet met on 8 April 2008 in a private members&#x27; club in London&#x27;s Covent Garden, with the occasion filmed by the press: it was the first time they had met since a mutual friend&#x27;s wedding in the early 1990s. The promotion for the tour received moderate television coverage, including a performance on the prime-time BBC chat show &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, broadcast in the UK on 16 May 2008. The tour was rapidly expanded to include concerts in Europe and in the US, as well as extra dates in the UK. The &#x27;Reconnected&#x27; tour, as it became known, began in Copenhagen on 26 May 2008, the same day as &quot;In Your Room&quot; was released. The concert of 10 July 2008 at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles was recorded to be re-aired on Richard Blade&#x27;s Sirius Radio show. Yazoo wrapped up the final two dates of the US tour by returning to New York City for the first time since October 1982.

In an interview in May 2008 with the online magazine &quot;Side-Line&quot;, Clarke said that there were plans to record the two London shows on the tour for a possible live album in the future. A double album titled &quot;Reconnected Live&quot;, featuring tracks recorded on the &quot;Reconnected&quot; tour, was eventually released in September 2010.

On 14 May 2011, Moyet appeared as a guest on stage before Erasure&#x27;s set on the second day of Mute Records&#x27; Short Circuit music festival at the Roundhouse in London. She performed three Yazoo songs with Clarke, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;Ode to Boy&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;. In an interview prior to the concert, Moyet said she was &quot;99.9% sure it&#x27;s the last time&quot; that she and Clarke would perform together as Yazoo, adding, &quot;It was really good that Vince and I had come through the whole circle of being really angry with each other, forgetting what we&#x27;d been angry about, and forgetting that there was ever any displeasure.&quot;

<text>The National Science and Media Museum (formerly The National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television, 1983–2006 and then the National Media Museum, 2006–2017), located in Bradford, West Yorkshire, is part of the national Science Museum Group in the UK. The museum has seven floors of galleries with permanent exhibitions focusing on photography, television, animation, videogaming, the Internet and the scientific principles behind light and colour. It also hosts temporary exhibitions and maintains a collection of 3.5 million pieces in its research facility.

The venue has three cinemas, including Europe&#x27;s first opened IMAX screen, finished in April 1983. It hosts festivals dedicated to widescreen film, video games and science. It has hosted popular film festivals, including the Bradford International Film Festival, until 2014.

In September 2011 the museum was voted the best indoor attraction in Yorkshire by the public, and it is one of the most visited museums in the north of England. the museum, in response to revenue shortfalls, has controversially adopted a policy of focusing on &quot;the science and culture of light and sound&quot;—to the exclusion of what are seen as &quot;unsustainable&quot; aspects of creativity and culture, such as past film festivals.

In March 2016 a £7.5 million five year investment plan in the museum was revealed by the Science Museum Group. In March 2017 its name was changed from National Media Museum to National Science and Media Museum.

In July 2023, the museum closed temporarily until 2025 as part of a project to construct two new galleries which will open in summer 2025 as of 16 January 2025 the museum has since reopened to visitors.

== Building and admission ==
Entrance is free, with the exception of cinema screens. The museum is open 10 am until 6 pm every day. The museum underwent a £16 million refurbishment in 1998, developing a new digital technology gallery. This new development created a new glass-fronted atrium, which houses a new café and shop.

===Galleries===
There are six permanent exhibitions:

* &quot;Kodak Gallery&quot; – The Kodak Gallery takes the viewer on a journey through the history of popular photography, from the world&#x27;s first photographs to the digital snapshots of today. Most of the items on display in the gallery are taken from the museum collection of 35,000 objects and images donated by Kodak.
* &quot;Wonderlab&quot; – Explores light and sound through interactive exhibits and live experiments. Opened in 2016, replacing the Experience TV gallery.
* &quot;BFI Mediatheque&quot; – Allows visitors to access the British Film Institute collection of film and television programmes in the BFI National Archive, including a dedicated selection titled &quot;TV Heaven&quot; from the former iteration of the gallery. 

* &quot;Games Lounge&quot; – Playable classic games in their original arcade or console formats; the history of video gaming; the story behind this global phenomenon.
* &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; – new galleries scheduled to open 2025

===Cinemas===

The museum incorporates the first permanent UK installation of an IMAX cinema (with a second screen opening in the UK 15 years later). Opened in 1983 as part of the Bradford Film Festival with the projector visible from a darkened booth of the 4th floor. Films included IMAX prints of &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; and &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. In 1999, IMAX upgraded the system and began releasing IMAX 3D presentations. In 2015 it was changed to digital projection instead of film. As a result, the IMAX projection booth is no longer visible.

The museum also incorporates the Pictureville Cinema – opened in 1992 and described by David Puttnam as &#x27;the best cinema in the world&#x27;, Pictureville Cinema screens everything from 70 mm to video; from Hollywood to Bollywood; from silents to digital sound, with certifications in presentation including THX in sound and picture and the Dolby EX system. In 2008, the cinema presented the only true recorded public screening of Danny Boyle&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;Alien Love Triangle&quot;.

Pictureville Cinema is one of only three public cinemas in the world permanently equipped to display original 3-strip 35mm Cinerama prints, and is the only public Cinerama venue in the UK. Cinerama films are screened at the annual Widescreen Weekend film festival.

The Cubby Broccoli Cinema (in memory of the producer of James Bond films), contains 106 seats and is used for a variety of film shows. In 2012, it was one of three venues in the UK to screen the Olympic Opening Ceremony in Super Hi-Vision.
===Insight===
&quot;Insight&quot; is a facility where members of the public can (by prior booking) view parts of the collections which are not on general display.

==Collection==

The museum&#x27;s collection contains 3.5 million items of historical, cultural and social value. Notable objects and archives include:

*The first photographic negative
*The earliest television footage
*The world&#x27;s first colour moving pictures
*Louis Le Prince&#x27;s 1888 films &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot; and &quot;Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge&quot;
*A collection of 35,000 objects and images donated by Kodak Ltd.
*A collection of around 1,000 historical objects from the BBC
*The photographic archive of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, comprising millions of images
*The photographic archive of Tony Ray-Jones
*Original toys from the BBC series &quot;Play School&quot; – the first programme on BBC2
*Objects and designs used in the making of Hammer horror films

The collections are accessible to the public through the museum&#x27;s Insight study centre.

The collection of the Royal Photographic Society was transferred to the Museum on behalf of the nation in 2003. , most of the collection is moving to the Victoria and Albert museum in London. The National Science and Media Museum &quot;will retain collections that help explore the development of photographic processes, such as the Kodak collection; the cultural impact of photography, such as the Daily Herald archive; and archives that have a direct relevance to Bradford.&quot;

== History ==
===National Museum of Photography, Film and Television===
The museum (throughout its name changes and to the present) occupies a site originally proposed for a theatre in central Bradford, for which work had been begun in the 1960s but which remained unfinished. Discussions and a decision between Dame Margaret Weston of the Science Museum, London, and Bradford&#x27;s city councillors led to the establishment of the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, as it was then called, which was opened on 16 June 1983.

Local funding for architectural work complemented the Science Museum&#x27;s funding to convert the building to its new use, with the bars and dressing rooms of the original theatre layout being converted to galleries, and with the conflicting demands of a theatre building occupying multiple storeys and a museum that would ideally reside on a single level needing to be accommodated. The museum&#x27;s centrepiece was its auditorium with IMAX cinema, and its opening launched &quot;the largest cinema screen in Britain&quot;: the IMAX screen was five storeys high with six-channel sound. During this period the museum specialised in the art and science of images and image-making. Colin Ford, its first director, believed that understanding how images are made led to better appreciation of the ideas expressed, the intentions and skills of the image-makers.

In 1986, to mark the 50th anniversary of the first public television service, two interactive television galleries were developed. These allowed visitors to directly operate cameras on a studio set with programmed sound and lighting, use vision mixers, read news items from an autocue and discover how chroma keying works. In 1989, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of photography, the museum launched the Kodak Gallery, a display of the history of photography from its invention to the present. This was followed by the installation of a standard television studio, first used by TV-am for outside broadcasts and, later, Nickelodeon. These studios were the first live broadcasting studios in a museum.

While continuing to run the Pictureville Cinema and exhibitions in a temporary venue on the other side of the city, the museum closed its main site on 31 August 1997 to allow for a 19-month, £16 million redevelopment, making the museum 25% bigger. The IMAX cinema was also developed to show 3D films. The new museum was opened on 16 June 1999 by Pierce Brosnan.

===National Media Museum===

On 1 December 2006, the museum was renamed the National Media Museum, and two new £3 million interactive galleries were opened: Experience TV, now replaced by Wonderlab, and TV Heaven, now the BFI Mediatheque. The interactive galleries were intended to represent the past, present and future of television and displayed scientific exhibits, such as television inventor John Logie Baird&#x27;s original apparatus, and television ephemera such as one of the only surviving Wallace and Gromit film sets and Play School toys. TV Heaven was a unique viewing facility where visitors could access an archive of more than 1000 programmes covering sixty years of British television history. TV Heaven closed in 2013, but 50 titles are still available via the BFI Mediatheque.

In 2009 the museum partnered with other bodies from the Bradford district in a successful bid to become the world&#x27;s first UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation) City of Film.

In February 2010, the museum unveiled a major revamp of the foyer. The remodeling included a brand new Games Lounge, a new gallery that drew on the National Videogame Archive established in 2008 in partnership with Nottingham Trent University. It was originally intended to be temporary, but one in five visitors to the Games Lounge named it as their favourite part of the museum, resulting in the creation of a permanent version in another part of the museum.

In March 2012 the museum opened Life Online, the world&#x27;s first gallery dedicated to exploring the social, technological and cultural impact of the Internet. The permanent gallery was initially accompanied by a temporary exhibition, &quot;[open source]: Is the internet you know under threat?&quot; The exhibition was an exploration of the open source nature of the Internet, and the current threats to both net neutrality and the general continuation of the open source culture.

In October 2014 the museum entered into a partnership with Picturehouse Cinemas, with the national chain taking over the running of the three cinema screens in a bid to boost audience figures and revenue. The partnership was designated &quot;Picturehouse at the National Media Museum&quot;. Despite sustained growth in ticket sales, the museum cancelled its participation in the 2015 Bradford International Film Festival and followed up by totally withdrawing from the festival the following year. This move, together with the 2016 transfer of a major photographic collection to London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum was very controversial.

In August 2016, the museum confirmed plans to permanently close their Experience TV gallery, after ten years, on 30 August 2016. A new gallery would open in the spring of 2017, called Wonderlab, which allows visitors to explore the sciences of light and sound in interactive exhibits. The television collection previously on display in Experience TV were made available for viewing through the Insight Centre at the museum.

===National Science and Media Museum===

In March 2017, the museum opened its £1.8 million interactive gallery Wonderlab. It also announced the second change of its name, to the National Science and Media Museum. Wonderlab is based on the principles of light and sound; attractions include a mirror maze, a 15-metre echo tube and a musical laser tunnel, as well as the world&#x27;s first permanent 3D-printed zoetrope.

On 7 August 2017, The Magic Factory, a permanent interactive exhibition that lets visitors &quot;get hands-on with light, lenses and mirror trickery to discover the science behind how we see the world around us&quot; closed. According to the museum, its space on Level 4 was refurbished as its new activity and picnic area, Makespace. Amongst the exhibits were a camera obscura, and pinhole camera providing views over Bradford city centre.

In September 2017, Soyuz TMA-19M – the space capsule that brought British astronaut Tim Peake back to Earth after his months-long stint on the International Space Station – was displayed at the museum. This was the first time the capsule had been displayed outside London.

In April 2018 the museum reported 505,000 visits in the 2017/18 financial year, a 25% increase on the previous year and the highest number since 2009.

In September 2019 the museum announced the end of its partnership with Picturehouse Cinemas and its return to an independent cinema operation. The operation was officially launched on 1 November 2019 under the name Pictureville.

On 5 June 2023, the museum temporarily closed for a major refurbishment. Life Online was closed for improvements to access and an enhanced foyer. The TV Gallery and Animation Gallery were closed for redevelopment as the new Sound and Vision Galleries. The museum is scheduled to reopen in 2025.

== Discontinued film festivals ==
The museum organised and held four major film events every year: Bradford International Film Festival, Bradford Animation Festival, Bite the Mango and Fantastic Films Weekend. These attracted international speakers and new and classic works from around the world. All four festivals were eventually cancelled by the museum.

=== Bradford International Film Festival ===
From its inception in 1995, Bradford International Film Festival (BIFF) presented new and classic films from around the world. The Festival presented films in their original formats wherever possible, and existed to develop understanding of the art and science of the moving image by hosting innovators in many fields of filmmaking.

BIFF included the Shine Awards – which highlighting the work of new European directors, a Filmmakers Weekend designed to offer guidance and support to filmmakers in the north of England, and the Widescreen Weekend, which discussed film formats including Cinerama, VistaVision, 70 mm and IMAX.

=== Bradford Animation Festival ===
The animation and video games festival was the UK&#x27;s leading event of its kind; host to discussions, workshops and special events. The annual BAF Awards honoured new animation from around the world.

Past guests include representatives from studios such as Pixar, Aardman, Wētā Workshop and Sony Interactive plus animators Ray Harryhausen, Richard Williams, Bob Godfrey, Caroline Leaf, Michael Dudok de Wit and Bill Plympton.

After the museum ended the festival following its 20th edition in 2014, former museum staff successfully revived the event in Manchester in November 2015 as Manchester Animation Festival.

=== Fantastic Films Weekend ===
This festival began in 2002 as a weekend event focusing on classic ghost stories and the supernatural. It developed into an annual celebration of horror, fantasy and sci-fi cinema and television. In February 2013 it was announced that the Fantastic Films Weekend would not continue.

=== The Co-operative Film Festival ===
The Co-operative Film Festival (formerly known as the Co-operative Young Film-Makers festival) started in 1966 and ended in 2013. It was a non-competitive and not-for-profit film festival designed to encourage young people to be creative. The museum was the host venue and associate of the festival from the year 1999 until 2013.

<doc id="186364" wikidata="Q190513" url="?curid=186364" title="Khanate of Sibir">
<text>The Khanate of Sibir (; ) was a state in western Siberia. It was founded at the end of the 15th century, following the break-up of the Golden Horde. Throughout its history, members of the Shaybanid and Taibugid dynasties often contested the rulership over the Khanate between each other; both of these competing tribes were direct patrilineal descendants of Genghis Khan through his eldest son Jochi and Jochi&#x27;s fifth son Shayban (Shiban) (died 1266). The area of the Khanate had once formed an integral part of the Mongol Empire, and later came under the control of the White Horde and the Golden Horde of 1242–1502.

The Khanate of Sibir had an ethnically diverse population of Turkic peoples – Siberian Tatars and various Uralic peoples – including the Khanty, the Mansi, and the Selkup. The Sibir Khanate was the northernmost Muslim state in recorded history. 
Its defeat by Yermak Timofeyevich in 1582 marked the beginning of the Russian conquest of Siberia.

==Aristocracy==
The Sibir Khanate was administered by mirzas (which is a noble title) who originated from various indigenous Siberian tribes. These mirzas organized loosely knit dominions, which were all under the nominal authority of the &quot;khan&quot; of Tyumen and Sibir. Mirzas also led the warriors of the Khanate of Sibir into battle and owed nominal allegiance to the &quot;khan&quot; of Tyumen and Sibir.

==Culture==
Islam was the professed religion of the Sibir Khanate; it was the religion of the ruling &quot;Khan&quot; of Tyumen and Sibir. Grand mosques, palaces and fortified walls were constructed by the ruling class in both Tyumen and Sibir.

Islam was professed by not only the Khan but also the Mirzas, who were often educated in famous Islamic centers in Central Asia like Bukhara and Samarkand. However, shamanism and other traditional beliefs were practiced by much of the masses. Some groups practiced a form of Islam that incorporated elements of shamanism.

The leading Imams and Muftis of the Sibir Khanate are known to have had some influence in Kazan and Samarkand. The Khanate of Sibir was the northernmost Muslim state in recorded history.

The Khanate of Sibir had extensive trading connections with Central Asia and the Khanate of Kazan.

==History==

The area was originally inhabited by mainly Samoyedic and Ugric peoples. In the 11th century, Kipchaks began inhabiting the region which led to the Turkification of the population. In the 13th century, the Mongols conquered the region and it was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde. Some of the Tatars who arrived with Batu Khan during the conquests settled in the area.

The original capital of the Khans was Chimgi-Tura, founded by the first Khan Taibuga, who was a member of the Borjigin. He was succeeded by his son Khoja or Hoca. The Khanate of Sibir as an independent polity was established in the fifteenth century, at a time when the Mongols of the house of Jochi were generally in a state of decline.

The Taibugids&#x27; control of the region between the Tobol and middle Irtysh was not uncontested. The Shaybanids, descendants of Jochi, frequently claimed the area as their own. Ibak Khan, a member of a junior branch of the Shaybanid house, killed Mar and seized Chimgi-Tura. A Taibugid restoration occurred when Mar&#x27;s grandson Muhammad fled to the eastern territories around the Irtysh and killed Ibak in battle in c. 1493. Muhammad decided not to remain at Chimgi-Tura, but chose a new capital named Iskar (or Sibir or Qashliq) located on the Irtysh.
The Russian conquest of Kazan in 1552 prompted the Taibugid Khan of Sibir, Yadigar, to seek friendly relations with Moscow. Yadigar, however, was challenged by a Shaybanid, Ibak&#x27;s grandson Kuchum. Several years of fighting (1556–1563) ended with Yadigar&#x27;s death and Kuchum becoming Khan.

===Conquest of Sibir===
Kuchum attempted to convert the Siberian Tatars, who were mostly shamanists, to Islam. His decision to conduct a raid on the Stroganov trading posts resulted in an expedition led by the Cossack Yermak against the Khanate of Sibir. Kuchum&#x27;s forces were defeated by Yermak at the Battle of Chuvash Cape in 1582 and the Cossacks entered Iskar later that year. Kuchum reorganized his forces, killed Yermak in battle in 1584, and reasserted his authority over Sibir.
Over the next fourteen years, however, the Russians slowly conquered the Khanate. In 1598 Kuchum was defeated on the banks of the Ob and was forced to flee to the territories of the Nogai, bringing an end to his rule.

==Taibugids and Shaybanids==
The Khanate of Sibir and the town of Tyumen were founded by Taibuga some time in the 13th century. He was probably of Keraite origin. However, some scholars also attempt to link the Taibugids to the Kipchak elites and others. Control alternated between the descendants of Taibuga and the Shaybanids who had descended from Genghis Khan. There are hints that the Shaybanids were more connected to the steppe nomads and that the Taibugids were more connected with the forest peoples to the north and east.

Taibuga&#x27;s father was called On (On-Son, Onsom and other variants). Grousset says that they were &#x27;the issue of Taibugha-bäki&#x27; without explanation (&#x27;bäki&#x27; (bek) was a princely suffix and Taibuqa was a Naiman chief at the time of Genghis Khan.) A few sources identify him with Bek Ondi Oglan, the great-great-great-grandson of Shayban, and thus a Shaybanid. The Stroganov chronicle says that On was killed by a chief called Chingi who spared Taibuga, sent him to fight the Ostyaks and granted him his own principality. Taibuga founded Tyumen and named it Chingi-tura in honor of his benefactor. Another source makes On a Nogai whose &#x27;Hoflager&#x27; (German for &#x27;court-camp&#x27;) was Kasyl-Tura at the mouth of the Ishim River about east of Tobolsk. Another source says that when Tokhtamysh was defeated he fled to the &#x27;land of Sibir&#x27; (the first mention of &#x27;Sibir&#x27; in Russian chronicles). Here he was protected by On until both were killed by Edigu about 1405.
There is no more information about Taibuga except that some say he drove the Novgoroders from his lands.
In 1428 a 17-year old Shaybanid called Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan was chosen Khan on the Tura River (possibly at Tyumen). This implies that the Taibugids had been pushed aside. When he led his followers south for better things the remaining Shaybanids gathered around Ibak Khan, who was from a junior branch of the house. The Taibugids must have been restored because some time between 1464 and 1480 Ibak killed the Taibugid Mar and made himself Khan. In 1483 Fyodor Kurbsky is said to have led an army to the Irtysh River, but this had no lasting effects. Ibak went to the Volga where he killed the last Khan of the Golden Horde. Returning, he was killed by Mar&#x27;s grandson called Mamuk or Makhmet or Mamet (about 1495). Makhmet moved the capital from Tyumen to Sibir and was briefly Khan of Kazan (1496). In 1552 the Taibugids Yediger and Bekbulat congratulated Ivan the Terrible on his conquest of Kazan. Later they paid limited tribute to Russia. In 1563 Ibak Khan&#x27;s grandson Kuchum seized the throne from Yediger and Bekbulat. In 1573, following the Russo-Crimean War (1571) he stopped paying tribute and raided the Perm lands. In 1582, he was driven out by Yermak and died some time after 1600.

<doc id="186367" wikidata="Q954625" url="?curid=186367" title="Myelodysplastic syndrome">
<text>A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is one of a group of cancers in which blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature, and as a result, do not develop into healthy blood cells. Early on, no symptoms typically are seen. Later, symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, bleeding disorders, anemia, or frequent infections. Some types may develop into acute myeloid leukemia.
Risk factors include previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, exposure to certain chemicals such as tobacco smoke, pesticides, and benzene, and exposure to heavy metals such as mercury or lead. Problems with blood cell formation result in some combination of low red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts. Some types of MDS cause an increase in the production of immature blood cells (called blasts), in the bone marrow or blood. The different types of MDS are identified based on the specific characteristics of the changes in the blood cells and bone marrow.
Treatments may include supportive care, drug therapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Supportive care may include blood transfusions, medications to increase the making of red blood cells, and antibiotics. Drug therapy may include the medications lenalidomide, antithymocyte globulin, and azacitidine. Some people can be cured by chemotherapy followed by a stem-cell transplant from a donor.
About seven per 100,000 people are affected by MDS; about four per 100,000 people newly acquire the condition each year. The typical age of onset is 70 years. The prognosis depends on the type of cells affected, the number of blasts in the bone marrow or blood, and the changes present in the chromosomes of the affected cells. The average survival time following diagnosis is 2.5 years. MDS was first recognized in the early 1900s; it came to be called myelodysplastic syndrome in 1976.
==Signs and symptoms==

Signs and symptoms are nonspecific and generally related to the blood cytopenias:
* Anemia (low RBC count or reduced hemoglobin) – chronic tiredness, shortness of breath, chilled sensation, sometimes chest pain
* Neutropenia (low neutrophil count) – increased susceptibility to infection
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) – increased susceptibility to bleeding and ecchymosis (bruising), as well as subcutaneous hemorrhaging resulting in purpura or petechiae

Many individuals are asymptomatic, and blood cytopenia or other problems are identified as a part of a routine blood count:
* Neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia
* Splenomegaly or rarely hepatomegaly
* Abnormal granules in cells, abnormal nuclear shape and size
* Chromosome abnormality, including chromosomal translocations and abnormal chromosome number

Patients with MDS have an overall risk of almost 30% for developing acute myelogenous leukemia.

Anemia dominates the early course. Most symptomatic patients complain of the gradual onset of fatigue and weakness, dyspnea, and pallor, but at least half the patients are asymptomatic and their MDS is discovered only incidentally on routine blood counts. Fever, weight loss and splenomegaly should point to a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) rather than pure myelodysplastic process.

==Cause==
Some people have a history of exposure to chemotherapy (especially alkylating agents such as melphalan, cyclophosphamide, busulfan, and chlorambucil) or radiation (therapeutic or accidental), or both (e.g., at the time of stem cell transplantation for another disease). Workers in some industries with heavy exposure to hydrocarbons such as the petroleum industry have a slightly higher risk of contracting the disease than the general population. Xylene and benzene exposures have been associated with myelodysplasia. Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange are at risk of developing MDS. A link may exist between the development of MDS &quot;in atomic-bomb survivors 40 to 60 years after radiation exposure&quot; (in this case, referring to people who were in close proximity to the dropping of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II). Children with Down syndrome are susceptible to MDS, and a family history may indicate a hereditary form of sideroblastic anemia or Fanconi anemia. GATA2 deficiency and SAMD9/9L syndromes each account for about 15% of MDS cases in children.

==Pathophysiology==
MDS most often develops without an identifiable cause. Risk factors include exposure to an agent known to cause DNA damage, such as radiation, benzene, and certain chemotherapies; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. Proving a connection between a suspected exposure and the development of MDS can be difficult, but the presence of genetic abnormalities may provide some supportive information. Secondary MDS can occur as a late toxicity of cancer therapy (therapy associated MDS, t-MDS). MDS after exposure to radiation or alkylating agents such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine, typically occurs 3–7 years after exposure and frequently demonstrates loss of chromosome 5 or 7. MDS after exposure to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors occurs after a shorter latency of only 1–3 years and can have a 11q23 translocation. Other pre-existing bone-marrow disorders such as acquired aplastic anemia following immunosuppressive treatment and Fanconi anemia can evolve into MDS.

MDS is thought to arise from mutations in the multipotent bone-marrow stem cell, but the specific defects responsible for these diseases remain poorly understood. Differentiation of blood precursor cells is impaired, and a significant increase in levels of apoptotic cell death occurs in bone-marrow cells. Clonal expansion of the abnormal cells results in the production of cells that have lost the ability to differentiate. If the overall percentage of bone-marrow myeloblasts rises over a particular cutoff (20% for WHO and 30% for FAB), then transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is said to have occurred. The progression of MDS to AML is a good example of the multistep theory of carcinogenesis in which a series of mutations occurs in an initially normal cell and transforms it into a cancer cell.

Although recognition of leukemic transformation was historically important (see History), a significant proportion of the morbidity and mortality attributable to MDS results not from transformation to AML, but rather from the cytopenias seen in all MDS patients. While anemia is the most common cytopenia in MDS patients, given the ready availability of blood transfusion, MDS patients rarely experience injury from severe anemia. The two most serious complications in MDS patients resulting from their cytopenias are bleeding (due to lack of platelets) or infection (due to lack of white blood cells). Long-term transfusion of packed red blood cells leads to iron overload.

===Genetics===
The recognition of epigenetic changes in DNA structure in MDS has explained the success of two (namely the hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine and decitabine) of three (the third is lenalidomide) commercially available medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat MDS. Proper DNA methylation is critical in the regulation of proliferation genes, and the loss of DNA methylation control can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cytopenias. The recently approved DNA methyltransferase inhibitors take advantage of this mechanism by creating a more orderly DNA methylation profile in the hematopoietic stem cell nucleus, thereby restoring normal blood counts and retarding the progression of MDS to acute leukemia.

Some authors have proposed that the loss of mitochondrial function over time leads to the accumulation of DNA mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, and this accounts for the increased incidence of MDS in older patients. Researchers point to the accumulation of mitochondrial iron deposits in the ringed sideroblast as evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in MDS.

===DNA damage===
Hematopoietic stem cell aging is thought to be associated with the accrual of multiple genetic and epigenetic aberrations leading to the suggestion that MDS is, in part, related to an inability to adequately cope with DNA damage. An emerging perspective is that the underlying mechanism of MDS could be a defect in one or more pathways that are involved in repairing damaged DNA. In MDS an increased frequency of chromosomal breaks indicates defects in DNA repair processes. Also elevated levels of 8-oxoguanine were found in the DNA of a significant proportion of MDS patients, indicating that the base excision repair pathway that is involved in handling oxidative DNA damages may be defective in these cases.

===5q- syndrome===
Since at least 1974, the deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5 has been known to be associated with dysplastic abnormalities of hematopoietic stem cells. By 2005, lenalidomide, a chemotherapy drug, was recognized to be effective in MDS patients with the 5q- syndrome, and in December 2005, the US FDA approved the drug for this indication. Patients with isolated 5q-, low IPSS risk, and transfusion dependence respond best to lenalidomide. Typically, prognosis for these patients is favorable, with a 63-month median survival. Lenalidomide has dual action, by lowering the malignant clone number in patients with 5q-, and by inducing better differentiation of healthy erythroid cells, as seen in patients without 5q deletion.

===Splicing factor mutations===

Mutations in splicing factors have been found in 40–80% of people with MDS, with a higher incidence of mutations detected in people who have more ring sideroblasts.

=== &quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2&quot; mutations ===
Mutations in the genes encoding for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (&quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2&quot;) occur in 10–20% of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and confer a worsened prognosis in low-risk MDS. Because the incidence of &quot;IDH1/2&quot; mutations increases as the disease malignancy increases, these findings together suggest that &quot;IDH1/2&quot; mutations are important drivers of progression of MDS to a more malignant disease state.

=== GATA2 deficiency ===
GATA2 deficiency is a group of disorders caused by a defect, familial, or sporadic inactivating mutations, in one of the two &quot;GATA2&quot; genes. These autosomal dominant mutations cause a reduction in the cellular levels of the gene&#x27;s product, GATA2. The GATA2 protein is a transcription factor critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lymph-forming, and other tissue-forming stem cells. In consequence of these mutations, cellular levels of GATA2 are low and individuals develop over time hematological, immunological, lymphatic, or other presentations. Prominent among these presentations is MDS that often progresses to acute myelocytic leukemia, or less commonly, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.

=== Transient myeloproliferative disease ===
Transient myeloproliferative disease, renamed Transient Abnormal Myelopoiesis (TAM), is the abnormal proliferation of a clone of noncancerous megakaryoblasts in the liver and bone marrow. The disease is restricted to individuals with Down syndrome or genetic changes similar to those in Down syndrome, develops during pregnancy or shortly after birth, and resolves within 3 months, or in about 10% of cases, progresses to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.

== Diagnosis ==
The elimination of other causes of cytopenias, along with a dysplastic bone marrow, is required to diagnose a myelodysplastic syndrome, so differentiating MDS from other causes of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia is important. MDS is diagnosed with any type of cytopenia (anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia) being present for at least 6 months, the presence of at least 10% dysplasia or blasts (immature cells) in 1 cell lineage, and MDS associated genetic changes, molecular markers or chromosomal abnormalities.

A typical diagnostic investigation includes:
* Full blood count and examination of blood film: The blood film morphology can provide clues about hemolytic anemia, clumping of the platelets leading to spurious thrombocytopenia, or leukemia.
* Blood tests to eliminate other common causes of cytopenias such as lupus, hepatitis, B12, folate, or other vitamin deficiencies, kidney failure or heart failure, HIV, hemolytic anemia, monoclonal gammopathy: Age-appropriate cancer screening should be considered for all anemic patients.
* Bone marrow examination by a hematopathologist: This is required to establish the diagnosis since all hematopathologists consider dysplastic marrow the key feature of myelodysplasia.
* Cytogenetics or chromosomal studies: This is ideally performed on the bone marrow aspirate. Conventional cytogenetics require a fresh specimen since live cells are induced to enter metaphase to allow chromosomes to be seen.
* Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization testing, usually ordered together with conventional cytogenetic testing, offers rapid detection of several chromosome abnormalities associated with MDS, including del 5q, −7, +8, and del 20q.
* Virtual karyotyping can be done for MDS, which uses computational tools to construct the karyogram from disrupted DNA. Virtual karyotyping does not require cell culture and has a dramatically higher resolution than conventional cytogenetics, but cannot detect balanced translocations.
* Flow cytometry is helpful to identify blasts, abnormal myeloid maturation, and establish the presence of any lymphoproliferative disorder in the marrow.
* Testing for copper deficiency should not be overlooked, as it can morphologically resemble MDS in bone-marrow biopsies. Risk factors for copper deficiency include bariatric surgery, zinc supplementation, and celiac disease.

The features generally used to define an MDS are blood cytopenias, ineffective hematopoiesis, dyserythropoiesis, dysgranulopoiesis, dysmegakaropoiesis, and increased myeloblasts.

Dysplasia can affect all three lineages seen in the bone marrow. The best way to diagnose dysplasia is by morphology and special stains
(PAS) used on the bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood smear. Dysplasia in the myeloid series is defined by:
* Granulocytic series:
*# Hypersegmented neutrophils (also seen in vit B12/folate deficiency)
*# Hyposegmented neutrophils (pseudo Pelger-Huet)
*# Hypogranular neutrophils or pseudo Chediak-Higashi (large azurophilic granules)
*# Auer rods – automatically RAEB II (if blast count &lt; 5% in the peripheral blood and &lt; 10% in the bone marrow aspirate); also note Auer rods may be seen in mature neutrophils in AML with translocation t(8;21)
*# Dimorphic granules (basophilic and eosinophilic granules) within eosinophils
* Erythroid series:
*# Binucleated erythroid precursors and karyorrhexis
*# Erythroid nuclear budding
*# Erythroid nuclear strings or internuclear bridging (also seen in congenital dyserythropoietic anemias)
*# Loss of e-cadherin in normoblasts is a sign of aberrancy.
*# PAS (globular in vacuoles or diffuse cytoplasmic staining) within erythroid precursors in the bone marrow aspirate (has no bearing on paraffin-fixed bone-marrow biopsy). Note: one can see PAS vacuolar positivity in L1 and L2 blasts (FAB classification; the L1 and L2 nomenclature is not used in the WHO classification)
*# Ringed sideroblasts (10 or more iron granules encircling one-third or more of the nucleus) seen on Perls&#x27; Prussian blue iron stain (&gt;15% ringed sideroblasts when counted among red cell precursors for refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts)
* Megakaryocytic series (can be the most subjective):
*# Hyposegmented nuclear features in platelet producing megakaryocytes (lack of lobation)
*# Hypersegmented (osteoclastic appearing) megakaryocytes
*# Ballooning of the platelets (seen with interference contrast microscopy)

On the bone-marrow biopsy, high-grade dysplasia (RAEB-I and RAEB-II) may show atypical localization of immature precursors, which are islands of immature precursors cells (myeloblasts and promyelocytes) localized to the center of the intertrabecular space rather than adjacent to the trabeculae or surrounding arterioles. This morphology can be difficult to differentiate from treated leukemia and recovering immature normal marrow elements. Also, topographic alteration of the nucleated erythroid cells can be seen in early myelodysplasia (RA and RARS), where normoblasts are seen next to bony trabeculae instead of forming normal interstitially placed erythroid islands.

=== Classification ===

====World Health Organization and International Consensus Classification====
In the late 1990s, a group of pathologists and clinicians working under the World Health Organization (WHO) modified this classification, introducing several new disease categories and eliminating others. In 2008, 2016, and 2022, the WHO developed new classification schemes that incorporated genetic findings (5q-) alongside morphology of the cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. As of 2024, the WHO 5th edition and International Consensus Classification (ICC) systems are both actively in use.

The list of dysplastic syndromes under the 2008 WHO system included the following:
==== MDS with single lineage dysplasia ====
MDS may present with isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia without anemia and with dysplastic changes confined to the single lineage. This is called MDS-Low Blasts in the WHO 5th ed.

==== MDS with increased blood counts ====
Patients with MDS occasionally present with leukocytosis or thrombocytosis instead of the usual cytopenia. This may represent overlap syndromes with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

==== MDS unclassifiable ====
Most cases of unclassifiable MDS from the 2008 WHO version would be considered Clonal Cytopenias of Undetermined Significance (CCUS) by the WHO 5th ed. CCUS is defined as:
* One or more somatic mutations otherwise found in patients with myeloid neoplasms detected in bone marrow or peripheral blood cells with an allele burden of ≥ 2%
* Persistent cytopenia (≥ 4 months) in one or more peripheral blood cell lineages
* Diagnostic criteria of myeloid neoplasm not fulfilled
* All other causes of cytopenia and molecular aberration excluded

====New categories in WHO 5th ed.====
Hypoplastic MDS, MDS with fibrosis, MDS with bi-allelic TP53 inactivation, and CCUS were added to the WHO 5th ed. Another subtype called Myeloid neoplasms with germ line predisposition and organ dysfunction includes CEBPA/DDX41/RUNX1 disorders, GATA2 deficiency and SAMD9/9L syndromes.

==Management==
The goals of therapy are to control symptoms, improve quality of life, improve overall survival, and decrease progression to AML.

The IPSS scoring system can help guide therapy for patients with MDS. In those with low risk MDS (designated by an IPSS score less than 3.5), no disease specific treatment has been found to be helpful and treatment is focused on supportive care by maintaining blood counts. Erythrostimulating agents such as darbepoetin alfa or erythropoietin may be used to raise the red blood cell count. The mean duration of response to erythrostimulating agents is 8-23 months, and the response rate is about 39% (with a response defined as a 1 mg/dL rise in the hemoglobin level or a person not requiring a transfusion).

Romiplostim and eltrombopag are thrombopoeitin receptor agonists which act on megakaryocytes (platelet precursor cells) to increase platelet production. They are used to increase platelet counts and have been shown to reduce the need for platelet transfusions. However, the two drugs increase the risk of progression to AML, so they are not used in MDS with excess blasts.

For those with high risk MDS (characterized by an IPSS score greater than 3.5), the hypomethylating agent azacitidine showed increased survival compared to standard care (supportive care, cytarabine or chemotherapy) and is considered the standard of care. Azacitidine had increased survival (24 months vs 15 months) and higher rates of partial or complete therapeutic response (29% vs 12%) as compared to conventional care. The hypomethylating agent decitabine has shown a similar survival benefit to azacitidine and has a response rate as high as 43%. Decitabine is available in combination with cedazuridine as Decitabine/cedazuridine (Inqovi) is a fixed-dosed combination medication for the treatment of adults with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).

Lenalidomide is effective in reducing red blood cell transfusion requirement in patients with the chromosome 5q deletion subtype (5q- syndrome) of MDS and the median duration of response is greater than 2 years.

Luspatercept is a TGFβ ligand that acts to decrease SMAD2 and SMAD3 signaling involved in erythropoeisis and may be used in MDS with anemia that is not responsive to erythrocyte stimulating agents or mild MDS with ring sideroblasts. Luspatercept was shown to decrease the need for transfusions and this effect lasted for a median of 30.6 weeks.

HLA-matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, particularly in younger (i.e. less than 40 years of age) and more severely affected patients, offers the potential for curative therapy. The success of bone marrow transplantation has been found to correlate with severity of MDS as determined by the IPSS score, with patients having a more favorable IPSS score tend to have a more favorable outcome with transplantation.

===Iron levels===
Iron overload may develop in MDS as a result of repeated RBC transfusions, which are a major part of the supportive care for anemic MDS patients. Although the specific therapies patients receive may obviate the need for RBC transfusion, many MDS patients may not respond to these treatments, thus may develop secondary hemochromatosis due to iron overload from repeated transfusions.
Patients with chronic iron overload can have iron deposits in their liver, heart, and endocrine glands.

For patients requiring many transfusions, serum ferritin levels, number of transfusions received, and associated organ dysfunction (heart, liver, and pancreas) should be monitored to determine iron levels. The goal is to maintain ferritin levels to . Currently, two iron chelators are available in the US, deferoxamine for intravenous use and deferasirox for oral use. A third chelating agent is available, deferiprone, but it has limited utility in MDS patients because of a major side effect of neutropenia.

Reversal of some of the consequences of iron overload in MDS by iron chelation therapy has been shown. Iron overload not only leads to organ damage, but also induces genomic instability and modifies the hematopoietic niche, favoring progression to acute leukemia. Chelation therapy should be considered to decrease iron overload in selected MDS patients. Although deferasirox is generally well tolerated (other than episodes of gastrointestinal distress and kidney dysfunction), it is associated with a rare risk of kidney failure or liver failure. Due to these risks, close monitoring is required.

==Prognosis==
The outlook in MDS is variable, with about 30% of patients progressing to refractory AML. Low risk MDS (which is associated with favorable genetic variants, decreased myeloblastic cells [less than 5% blasts], less severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia or lower International Prognostic Scoring System scores) is associated with a life expectancy of 3–10 years. Whereas high risk MDS is associated with a life expectancy of less than 3 years.

Stem-cell transplantation offers possible cure, with survival rates of 50% at 3 years, although older patients do poorly.

Indicators of a good prognosis:
Younger age; normal or moderately reduced neutrophil or platelet counts; low blast counts in the bone marrow (&lt; 20%) and no blasts in the blood; no Auer rods; ringed sideroblasts; normal or mixed karyotypes without complex chromosome abnormalities; and &quot;in vitro&quot; marrow culture with a nonleukemic growth pattern

Indicators of a poor prognosis:
Advanced age; severe neutropenia or thrombocytopenia; high blast count in the bone marrow (20–29%) or blasts in the blood;
Auer rods; absence of ringed sideroblasts; abnormal localization or immature granulocyte precursors in bone marrow section;
completely or mostly abnormal karyotypes, or complex marrow chromosome abnormalities and &quot;in vitro&quot; bone marrow culture with a leukemic growth pattern

Karyotype prognostic factors:
* Good: normal, -Y, del(5q), del(20q)
* Intermediate or variable: +8, other single or double anomalies
* Poor: complex (&gt;3 chromosomal aberrations); chromosome 7 anomalies

Cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected by conventional cytogenetics, a FISH panel for MDS, or virtual karyotype.

The best prognosis is seen with RA and RARS, where some nontransplant patients live more than a decade (typical is on the order of three to five years, although long-term remission is possible if a bone-marrow transplant is successful). The worst outlook is with RAEB-T, where the mean life expectancy is less than one year. About one-quarter of patients develop overt leukemia. The others die of complications of low blood count or unrelated diseases. The International Prognostic Scoring System is the most commonly used tool for determining the prognosis of MDS, first published in &quot;Blood&quot; in 1997, then revised to IPSS-R and IPSS-M. This system takes into account the percentage of blasts in the marrow, cytogenetics, and number of cytopenias, as well as molecular features in the case of IPSS-M. Other prognostic tools include the 2007 WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS), the MDA-LR (MD Anderson Lower-Risk MDS Prognostic Scoring System), EuroMDS, and Cleveland Clinic Foundation/Munich Leukemia Laboratory scoring systems.

=== Genetic markers ===
The IPSS-M incorporates 31 somatic genes in its risk stratification model. IPSS-M determined that multihit TP53 mutations, FLT3 mutations, and partial tandem duplication mutations of KMT2A (MLL) were strong predictors of adverse outcomes. Some SF3B1 mutations were associated with favorable outcomes, whereas certain genetic subsets of SF3B1 mutations were not. In low-risk MDS, &quot;IDH1&quot; and &quot;IDH2&quot; mutations are associated with worsened survival.

==Epidemiology==
The exact number of people with MDS is not known because it can go undiagnosed and no tracking of the syndrome is mandated. Some estimates are on the order of 10,000 to 20,000 new cases each year in the United States alone. The number of new cases each year is probably increasing as the average age of the population increases, and some authors propose that the number of new cases in those over 70 may be as high as 15 per 100,000 per year.

The typical age at diagnosis of MDS is between 60 and 75 years; a few people are younger than 50, and diagnoses are rare in children. Males are slightly more commonly affected than females.

==History==
Since the early 20th century, some people with acute myelogenous leukemia were begun to be recognized to have a preceding period of anemia and abnormal blood cell production. These conditions were lumped together with other diseases under the term &quot;refractory anemia&quot;. The first description of &quot;preleukemia&quot; as a specific entity was published in 1953 by Block &quot;et al.&quot; The early identification, characterization and classification of this disorder were problematical, and the syndrome went by many names until the 1976 FAB classification was published and popularized the term MDS.

=== French-American-British (FAB) classification ===
In 1974 and 1975, a group of pathologists from France, the US, and Britain produced the first widely used classification of these diseases. This French-American-British classification was published in 1976, and revised in 1982. It was used by pathologists and clinicians for almost 20 years. Cases were classified into five categories:

(A table comparing these is available from the Cleveland Clinic.)

<text>Tom Taylor (19 October 1817 – 12 July 1880) was an English dramatist, critic, biographer, public servant, and editor of &quot;Punch&quot; magazine. Taylor had a brief academic career, holding the professorship of English literature and language at University College, London in the 1840s, after which he practised law and became a civil servant. At the same time he became a journalist, most prominently as a contributor to, and eventually editor of, &quot;Punch&quot;, a humour magazine.

In addition to these vocations, Taylor began a theatre career and became best known as a playwright, with up to 100 plays staged during his career. Many were adaptations of French plays, but these and his original works cover a range from farce to melodrama. Most fell into neglect after Taylor&#x27;s death, but &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; (1858), which achieved great success in the 19th century, remains famous as the piece that was being performed in the presence of Abraham Lincoln when he was assassinated in 1865.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Taylor was born into a newly wealthy family at Bishopwearmouth, a suburb of Sunderland, in north-east England. He was the second son of Thomas Taylor (1769–1843) and his wife, Maria Josephina, &quot;née&quot; Arnold (1784–1858). His father had begun as a labourer on a small farm in Cumberland and had risen to become co-owner of a flourishing brewery in Durham. After attending the Grange School in Sunderland, and studying for two sessions at the University of Glasgow, Taylor became a student of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1837, was elected to a scholarship in 1838, and graduated with a BA in both classics and mathematics. He was elected a fellow of the college in 1842 and received his MA degree the following year.
Taylor left Cambridge in late 1844 and moved to London, where for the next two years he pursued three careers simultaneously. He was professor of English language and literature at University College, London, while at the same time studying to become a barrister, and beginning his life&#x27;s work as a writer. Taylor was called to the bar of the Middle Temple in November 1846. He resigned his university post, and practised on the northern legal circuit until he was appointed assistant secretary of the Board of Health in 1850. On the reconstruction of the board in 1854 he was made secretary, and on its abolition in 1858 his services were transferred to a department of the Home Office, retiring on a pension in 1876.

===Writer===
Taylor owed his fame and most of his income not to his academic, legal or government work, but to his writing. Soon after moving to London, he obtained remunerative work as a leader writer for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot;. He was also art critic for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Graphic&quot; for many years. He edited the &quot;Autobiography of B. R. Haydon&quot; (1853), the &quot;Autobiography and Correspondence of C. R. Leslie, R.A.&quot; (1860) and &quot;Pen Sketches from a Vanished Hand&quot;, selected from papers of Mortimer Collins, and wrote &quot;Life and Times of Sir Joshua Reynolds&quot; (1865). With his first contribution to &quot;Punch&quot;, on 19 October 1844, Taylor began a thirty-six year association with the weekly humour and satire magazine, which ended only with his death. During the 1840s he wrote on average three columns a month; in the 1850s and 1860s this output doubled. His biographer Craig Howes writes that Taylor&#x27;s articles were generally humorous commentary or comic verses on politics, civic news, and the manners of the day. In 1874 he succeeded Charles William Shirley Brooks as editor.

Taylor also established himself as a playwright and eventually produced about 100 plays. Between 1844 and 1846, the Lyceum Theatre staged at least seven of his plays, including extravanzas written with Albert Smith or Charles Kenney, and his first major success, the 1846 farce &quot;To Parents and Guardians&quot;. &quot;The Morning Post&quot; said of that piece, &quot;The writing is admirable throughout – neat, natural and epigrammatic&quot;. It was as a dramatist that Taylor made the most impression – his biographer in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (&quot;DNB&quot;) wrote that in writing plays Taylor found his true vocation. In thirty-five years he wrote more than seventy plays for the principal London theatres.
A substantial portion of Taylor&#x27;s prolific output consisted of adaptations from the French or collaborations with other playwrights, notably Charles Reade. Some of his plots were adapted from the novels of Charles Dickens or others. Many of Taylor&#x27;s plays were extremely popular, such as &quot;Masks and Faces&quot;, an extravaganza written in collaboration with Reade, produced at the Haymarket Theatre in November 1852. It was followed by the almost equally successful &quot;To Oblige Benson&quot; (Olympic Theatre, 1854), an adaptation from a French vaudeville. Others mentioned by the &quot;DNB&quot; are &quot;Plot and Passion&quot; (1853), &quot;Still Waters Run Deep&quot; (1855) and &quot;The Ticket-of-Leave Man&quot; (based on &quot;Le Retour de Melun&quot; by Édouard Brisebarre and Eugène Nus), a melodrama produced at the Olympic in 1863. Taylor also wrote a series of historical dramas (many in blank verse), including &quot;The Fool’s Revenge&quot; (1869), an adaption of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Le roi s&#x27;amuse&quot; (also adapted by Verdi as &quot;Rigoletto&quot;), &quot;&#x27;Twixt Axe and Crown&quot; (1870), &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;arc&quot; (1871), &quot;Lady Clancarty&quot; (1874) and &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; (1875). The last of these, produced at the Haymarket in 1875, was Taylor&#x27;s penultimate piece and only complete failure. In 1871 Taylor supplied the words to Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s dramatic cantata, &quot;On Shore and Sea&quot;.

Like his colleague W. S. Gilbert, Taylor believed that plays should be readable as well as actable; he followed Gilbert in having copies of his plays printed for public sale. Both authors did so at some risk, because it made matters easy for American pirates of their works in the days before international copyright protection. Taylor wrote, &quot;I have no wish to screen myself from literary criticism behind the plea that my plays were meant to be acted. It seems to me that every drama submitted to the judgment of audiences should be prepared to encounter that of readers&quot;.
Many of Taylor&#x27;s plays were extremely popular, and several survived into the 20th century, although most are largely forgotten today. His &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; (1858) is now remembered chiefly as the play Abraham Lincoln was attending when he was assassinated, but it was revived many times during the 19th century with great success. It became celebrated as a vehicle for the popular comic actor Edward Sothern, and after his death, his sons, Lytton and E. H. Sothern, took over the part in revivals.

===Personal life===
Howes records that Taylor was described as &quot;of middle height, bearded [with] a pugilistic jaw and eyes which glittered like steel&quot;. Known for his remarkable energy, he was a keen swimmer and rower, who rose daily at five or six and wrote for three hours before taking an hour&#x27;s brisk walk from his house in Wandsworth to his Whitehall office. 

Some, like Ellen Terry, praised Taylor&#x27;s kindness and generosity; others, including F. C. Burnand, found him obstinate and unforgiving. Terry wrote of Taylor in her memoirs:
Terry&#x27;s frequent stage partner, Henry Irving said that Taylor was an exception to the general rule that it was helpful, even though not essential, for a dramatist to be an actor to understand the techniques of stagecraft: &quot;There is no dramatic author who more thoroughly understands his business&quot;.

In 1855 Taylor married the composer, musician and artist Laura Wilson Barker (1819–1905). She contributed music to at least one of his plays, an overture and entr&#x27;acte to &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1871), and harmonisations to his translation &quot;Ballads and Songs of Brittany&quot; (1865). There were two children: the artist John Wycliffe Taylor (1859–1925) and Laura Lucy Arnold Taylor (1863–1940). Taylor and his family lived at 84 Lavender Sweep, Battersea, where they held Sunday musical soirees. Celebrities who attended included Lewis Carroll, Charles Dickens, Henry Irving, Charles Reade, Alfred Tennyson, Ellen Terry and William Makepeace Thackeray. 

Taylor died suddenly at his home in 1880 at the age of 62 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery. After his death, his widow retired to Coleshill, Buckinghamshire, where she died on 22 May 1905.

<text>Chengyu () are a type of traditional Chinese idiomatic expressions, most of which consist of four Chinese characters. &quot;Chengyu&quot; were widely used in Literary Chinese and are still common in written vernacular Chinese writing and in the spoken language today. According to the most stringent definition, there are about 5,000 &quot;chengyu&quot; in the Chinese language, though some dictionaries list over 20,000. &quot;Chengyu&quot; are considered the collected wisdom of the Chinese culture, and contain the experiences, moral concepts, and admonishments from previous generations of Chinese speakers. &quot;Chengyu&quot; still play an important role in Chinese conversation and education. Chinese idioms are one of four types of formulaic expressions (), which also include collocations (), two-part allegorical sayings called &quot;xiehouyu&quot;, and proverbs ().

While not the only idioms in Chinese, and not always four characters long, they are often referred to as Chinese idioms or four-character idioms.

==Origins, construction, and interpretation==
&quot;Chengyu&quot; are mostly derived from ancient literature, including the pre-Qin classics, poetry from all periods of Chinese history, and late imperial vernacular novels and short stories. A small number were constructed in the 19th and early 20th centuries from Western source materials. Among the early classical literature, the lyrical imagery from the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;, and the detailed stories recorded in the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot; and the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; serve as particularly rich source materials for chengyu. Since the &quot;Shijing&quot; poems consist of four-character lines, some &quot;chengyu&quot; are direct quotes from the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;. For example, &#x27;ten-thousand year lifespan without bound&#x27;, a traditional expression to wish someone a long life that often appears on bowls and tableware, quotes the poem &quot;Tian Bao&quot; (, poem #166) in the Lesser Court Hymns section of the &quot;Classic of Poetry&quot;. More commonly, however, &quot;chengyu&quot; are created by succinctly paraphrasing or summarizing the original text, usually by selecting the most salient characters from the passage in question and inserting any necessary classical grammatical particles.

As such, &quot;chengyu&quot; are fossilized expressions that use the vocabulary and follow the syntactic rules of Literary Chinese. Consequently, they convey information more compactly than normal vernacular speech or writing. They may contain subject and predicate and act as an independent clause (or even twin two-character independent clauses in parallel), or they may play the role of any part of speech in a sentence, acting syntactically as an adjective, adverb, verb, or noun phrase. In both speech and writing, they serve to succinctly convey a complex or multifaceted situation, scene, or concept, and used fittingly and elegantly, they also mark a speaker or writer&#x27;s erudition.

The meaning of a &quot;chengyu&quot; usually surpasses the sum of the meanings carried by the four characters, as &quot;chengyu&quot; are generally meant to convey the message or moral of the myth, story or historical event from which they were derived. Thus, even after translation into modern words and syntax, &quot;chengyu&quot; in isolation are often unintelligible without additional explanation. Since they often contain a classical allusion, known as a (), elementary and secondary school students in greater China learn &quot;chengyu&quot; as part of the classical curriculum in order to study the context from which the &quot;chengyu&quot; was born.

Often the four characters reflect the moral behind the story rather than the story itself. For example, the phrase &quot; (&quot;, lit: &quot;break the pots and sink the ships&quot;) is based on a historical account where the general Xiang Yu ordered his troops to destroy all cooking utensils and boats after crossing a river into the enemy&#x27;s territory. He won the battle because of this &quot;no-retreat&quot; strategy. Thus, the idiom is used as a verb phrase with the meaning &quot;to make an all-out effort to achieve success by the deliberate removal of recourse or backup.&quot; Similar phrases are known in the West, such as &quot;Burning one&#x27;s boats&quot;, &quot;burning one&#x27;s bridges&quot;, &quot;Point of no return&quot; or &quot;Crossing the Rubicon&quot;.

Another example is (&#x27; &#x27;melon field, beneath the plums&#x27;), whose meaning relates to the appearance of misconduct or impropriety. It is derived from an excerpt of a Han-era poem (, &quot;Yuèfǔ Shī&quot; &quot;Jūnzǐ Xíng&quot;). The poem includes the lines &#x27;don&#x27;t adjust your shoes in a melon field, and don&#x27;t tidy your hat under the plum trees&#x27; (, &#x27;), admonishing the reader to avoid situations where, however innocent, he might be suspected of doing wrong. The idiom is impossible to understand without the background knowledge of the origin of the phrase.

Some idioms have had their literal meanings overtake their original ones. For example, &#x27;wind from an empty cave&#x27; (, &quot;kōng xué lái fēng&quot;), despite now being used to describe rumors without source, originally referred to rumors with actual, solid sources or reasons. Likewise, &#x27;bare-faced facing the emperor&#x27; () is now used to describe beauty that does not require make-up, e.g., when entering court, while its original meaning was &quot;to be confident in one&#x27;s true look&quot;.

However, not all &quot;chengyu&quot; have stories to draw morals from. An example is &#x27;speaking, yet without trust&#x27;, referring to one who cannot be trusted despite what he says, an essentially deceitful person. It is generally acknowledged as a &quot;chengyu&quot; as it comes from the &quot;Analects&quot;. The idiom is succinct in its original meaning and would likely be intelligible to anyone learned in formal written Chinese, though () is no longer commonly used as a verb.

There are a few &quot;chengyu&quot; that are not four characters in length. An example is the seven-character &#x27;The Old Drunkard&#x27;s attention is not directed towards his wine&#x27;. This is a direct quote from Ouyang Xiu&#x27;s essay &quot;An Account of Old Drunkard&#x27;s Pavilion&quot; (), in which the author, as the Old Drunkard, expresses his true intention of enjoying the scenery of the mountains and rivers as he drinks. As an idiom, it expresses the situation where one does something with an ulterior though benign motive in mind.

Some &quot;chengyu&quot; have English equivalents. For example, &#x27;speak not from the bosom&#x27; and &#x27;to speak with one&#x27;s tongue in one&#x27;s cheek&#x27; share idiomatic meanings. The Chinese not having conducted maritime explorations of the North Atlantic during imperial times, the expression &#x27;one corner of an ice mountain&#x27; is a rare example of a &quot;chengyu&quot; that emerged in the early 20th century after contact with the West as a translation of the expression &quot;tip of the iceberg,&quot; thus sharing both their literal and idiomatic meanings. Another expression &#x27;extracting chestnuts from the fire&#x27;, originating from a La Fontaine fable, means &quot;to be duped into taking risks for someone else,&quot; used in much the same way as the expression &quot;cat&#x27;s paw&quot; in English is another example of an &quot;international&quot; &quot;chengyu&quot;. Though they are recent in origin, they are constructed using the vocabulary and syntax of Literary Chinese and fits within the four-character scheme, making them &quot;chengyu&quot;.

Chinese idioms can also serve as a guide through Chinese culture. &quot;Chengyu&quot; teach about motifs that were previously common in Chinese literature and culture. For example, idioms with nature motifse.g., mountains, water, and the Moonare numerous. Works considered masterpieces of Chinese literaturesuch as the Four Great Classical Novels – serve as the source for many idioms, which in turn condense and retell the story.

All Chinese people know idioms, though the total number known by any one individual will depend on their background. Idioms are such an important part of Chinese popular culture that there is a game called &#x27;connect the chengyu&#x27; that involves someone calling out an idiom, with someone else then being supposed to think of another idiom to link up with the first one, so that the last character of the first idiom is the same as the first character of the second idiom, and so forth.

==Chinese examples==
The following three examples show that the meaning of the idiom can be totally different by only changing one character.
* : &quot;One day, a thousand autumns.&quot;
** Meaning: implies rapid changes; one day equals a thousand years
* : &quot;One day, a thousand miles.&quot;
** Meaning: implies rapid progress; traveling a thousand miles in a day
* : &quot;One day, three autumns.&quot;
** Meaning: greatly missing someone; one day feels as long as three years

* &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;
* Seek truth from facts
* When two tigers fight
* Mirror Flower, Water Moon

==Japanese examples==

&quot;Yojijukugo&quot; is the similar format in Japanese. The term is autological. Many of these idioms were adopted from their Chinese counterparts and have the same or similar meaning as in Chinese. The term refers to an idiom that comes from a specific text as the source. As such, the overwhelming majority of &quot;koji seigo&quot; comes from accounts of history written in classical Chinese. Although a great many of the Japanese four-character idioms are derived from the Chinese, many others are purely Japanese in origin. Some examples:

* &quot;ka, chō, fū, getsu&quot; (&quot;Flower, Bird, Wind, Moon&quot;; beauties of nature)
* &quot;ichigo ichie&quot; (once-in-a-lifetime experience)
* &quot;okamehachimoku&quot; (a bystander&#x27;s vantage point)
* &quot;temaemiso&quot; (singing one&#x27;s own praises; tooting one&#x27;s own horn)
* &quot;futamatagōyaku&quot; (double-dealer; time-server)
* &quot;fū, rin, ka, zan&quot; (&quot;wind, woods, fire, mountain&quot;; military proverb coming from Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;Art of War&quot;; see also Fūrinkazan)

==Korean examples==
The Korean equivalent are &quot;sajaseongeo&quot; (). They have similar categorization to Japanese ones, such as &quot;gosaseongeo&quot; () for historical idioms.

== Vietnamese examples ==
Four word idioms or any idiom in Vietnamese are known as thành ngữ (chữ Hán: 成語, literally &quot;set phrase/speech&quot;). A large amount of idioms originating from Classical Chinese have been borrowed into the language, but there exists native counterparts to the Classical Chinese idioms. There are also many idioms that are Vietnamese in origin. Vietnamese idioms can be classified into Sino-Vietnamese idioms (Vietnamese: thành ngữ Hán Việt, chữ Hán Nôm: 成語漢越) and native Vietnamese idioms (Vietnamese: thành ngữ thuần Việt, chữ Hán Nôm: 成語純越) that were once written in chữ Nôm, are now written in the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet.


== In popular culture == 
The plot of the Taiwanese comedy-drama GG Precinct centres on people murdered for misquoting Chinese idioms.

<doc id="186376" wikidata="Q264730" url="?curid=186376" title="Gloria Vanderbilt">
<text>Gloria Laura Vanderbilt (February 20, 1924 – June 17, 2019) was an American artist, author, actress, fashion designer, heiress, and socialite. During the 1930s, she was the subject of a high-profile child custody trial in which her mother, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, and her paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, each sought custody of her and control over her trust fund. Called the &quot;trial of the century&quot; by the press, the court proceedings were the subject of wide and sensational press coverage, due to the wealth and prominence of the involved parties and the scandalous evidence presented to support Whitney&#x27;s claim that Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt was an unfit parent.

In the 1970s, Vanderbilt launched a line of fashions, perfumes, and household goods bearing her name. She was particularly noted as an early developer of designer blue jeans.

==Early life==
Vanderbilt was born on February 20, 1924, in Manhattan, New York City, the only child of railroad heir Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt family and his second wife, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt. When Vanderbilt was born, her father was heard to exclaim in delight, &quot;It is fantastic how Vanderbilt she looks! See the corners of her eyes, how they turn up?&quot; She was baptized in the Episcopal Church by Bishop Herbert Shipman as Gloria Laura Vanderbilt. After her father&#x27;s death, she was confirmed and raised in the Catholic Church, to which her mother belonged. From her father&#x27;s first marriage to Cathleen Neilson, she had one elder half-sister, Cathleen Vanderbilt.

Upon their father&#x27;s death from cirrhosis, when Vanderbilt was 18 months old, she and her half-sister became heiresses to a half share, each, in a $5 million trust fund, equivalent to $ million in value. The control of Vanderbilt&#x27;s share, while she was a minor, belonged to her mother, who, for years, traveled to and from Paris, taking her daughter with her. They were accompanied by a beloved nanny—Emma Sullivan Kieslich, whom young Gloria had named &quot;Dodo&quot;—who would play a tumultuous part in the child&#x27;s life, and her mother&#x27;s identical twin sister, Thelma, who was the lover of the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), during this time. As a result of her spending habits, her mother&#x27;s use of finances was scrutinized by the child&#x27;s paternal aunt, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. A sculptor and philanthropist, Whitney wanted custody of her niece, which resulted in a custody trial. The trial was so scandalous that at times, the judge would make everyone leave the room, so as to listen to what young Vanderbilt had to say without anyone influencing her. Some people heard weeping and wailing from inside the courtroom. Testimony was heard depicting Vanderbilt&#x27;s mother as an unfit parent, including an allegation from Marie Caillot, her discharged French maid, of a lesbian affair with the Marchioness of Milford Haven, a relative of the British royal family, which Lady Milford Haven would subsequently deny in her own testimony. Vanderbilt&#x27;s mother lost the battle, and Vanderbilt became the ward of her aunt Gertrude.

Litigation continued, however. Vanderbilt&#x27;s mother was forced to live on a drastically reduced portion of her daughter&#x27;s trust, which was worth more than $4 million, at the end of 1937, equivalent to $ million in value. Visitation was also closely watched, to ensure that Vanderbilt&#x27;s mother did not exert any undue influence upon her daughter with her supposedly &quot;raucous&quot; lifestyle. Vanderbilt was raised amidst luxury at her aunt Gertrude&#x27;s mansion in Old Westbury, Long Island, surrounded by cousins her age who lived in houses circling the vast estate and in New York City.

The story of the trial was told in the 1980 Barbara Goldsmith book, &quot;Little Gloria... Happy at Last,&quot; and a 1982 NBC miniseries based on it, which was nominated for six Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Actress Jennifer Dundas played Gloria.

Vanderbilt attended the Greenvale School on Long Island; Miss Porter&#x27;s School in Farmington, Connecticut; and then the Wheeler School in Providence, Rhode Island, as well as the Art Students League in New York City, developing the artistic talent for which she would become increasingly known during her career. When Vanderbilt came of age and took control of her trust fund, she cut her mother off entirely, though they later were reconciled. Her mother died in Los Angeles, in 1965.

==Career==

===Theater arts===
From 1954 to 1963, Vanderbilt applied herself to acting. She studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse, with teacher Sanford Meisner, and debuted in 1954, in &quot;The Swan,&quot; staged at Pocono Playhouse in Mountainhome, Pennsylvania. In 1955, she appeared on Broadway, as Elsie, in a revival of William Saroyan&#x27;s &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;. Vanderbilt also appeared in a number of live and filmed television dramas, including &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood,&quot; and &quot;The Dick Powell Show&quot;. She made an appearance in a two-part episode of &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; in 1981. Other TV programs on which she appeared include &quot;Person to Person,&quot; with Edward R. Murrow, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;Live! with Kelly and Michael&quot; and &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot;.

===Fashion ===
Vanderbilt began her career as a fashion model when she was 15 years old, appearing in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar.&quot;

During the 1970s, Vanderbilt ventured into the fashion business itself, first with Glentex, licensing her name and a collection of her paintings for a line of scarves. In 1976, Indian designer Mohan Murjani&#x27;s Murjani Corporation proposed launching a line of designer jeans carrying Vanderbilt&#x27;s signature embroidered on the back pocket, as well as her swan logo. Her jeans were more tightly fitted than other jeans of that time and were an immediate success with customers.

In 1978, Vanderbilt sold the rights to her name to the Murjani Group and re-launched her own company, GV Ltd, which she had founded in 1976. With her company, she launched dresses, blouses, sheets, shoes, leather goods, liqueurs, and accessories. In the period from 1982 to 2002, L&#x27;Oreal launched eight fragrances under the brand name &quot;Gloria Vanderbilt.&quot; Murjan sold rights to the name &quot;Gloria Vanderbilt&quot; to the owners of Gitano Group Inc. in 1988.

Jones Apparel Group acquired the rights to Gloria Vanderbilt jeans in 2002.

Gloria Vanderbult herself became an icon thanks to the numerous portrait shots.
Among the famous photographers were Cecil Beaton, Gordon Parks, Horst P. Horst, Gianni Penat, Jeff Riedel,
Paul Schutzer, Thomas Iannaccone, Ron Galella and Jack Robinson.

====Fraud trial====
In the 1980s, Vanderbilt accused her former partners in GV Ltd. and her lawyer of fraud. After a lengthy trial (during which time the lawyer died), Vanderbilt won and was awarded nearly $1.7 million, but the money was never recovered.
She was also awarded $300,000 by the New York City Bar Association. Vanderbilt also owed millions of dollars in back taxes, since the lawyer had never paid the IRS, and she was forced to sell her Southampton, New York, and Upper East Side homes.

===Art ===
Vanderbilt studied art at the Art Students League of New York. She became known for her artwork, with one-woman exhibitions held of her oil paintings, watercolors, and pastels. Her first exhibition was held in 1948. This artwork was adapted and licensed, starting about 1968, by Hallmark Cards and by Bloomcraft (a textile manufacturer), and Vanderbilt began designing specifically for linen, pottery, and glassware.

In 2001, Vanderbilt returned to art and opened her first art exhibition, &quot;Dream Boxes&quot;, at the Southern Vermont Arts Center in Manchester; it was a critical success. She launched another exhibition of 35 paintings at the Arts Center in 2007. Two years later, Vanderbilt returned to the Arts Center as a panelist at its Annual Fall Show Exhibition, signing copies of her latest novel, &quot;Obsession: An Erotic Tale&quot;.

When Vanderbilt celebrated her 90th birthday on February 20, 2014, a collection of her drawings, paintings and collages was placed on display in the 1stdibs Gallery at New York Design Center in New York City, in an exhibit called &quot;The Left Hand Is The Dreamer&quot;.

===Writings===
Vanderbilt wrote two books on art and home decor, four volumes of memoirs, three novels, and a singular collection of short stories, &quot;The Things We Fear Most&quot;. She was also a regular contributor to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;Elle&quot;. In November 2010, Vanderbilt was the subject of a new book chronicling her life, &quot;The World of Gloria Vanderbilt,&quot; written by Wendy Goodman, &quot;New York&quot; magazine&#x27;s design editor. The book, published by Abrams Books, featured many previously unreleased photographs.

In January 2017, HarperCollins Publishers released a book coauthored by Vanderbilt and her son Anderson Cooper, &quot;The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss&quot;. The book was described by its publisher as &quot;{a} touching and intimate correspondence between Anderson Cooper and his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, offering timeless wisdom and a revealing glimpse into their lives&quot;.

===&quot;Nothing Left Unsaid&quot; documentary===
On April 9, 2016, HBO premiered &quot;Nothing Left Unsaid: Gloria Vanderbilt &amp; Anderson Cooper&quot;, a two-hour documentary produced and directed by Liz Garbus. It features a series of conversations between the mother and son, covering her life and family history in the public eye.

==Personal life==
Vanderbilt was married four times, divorced three times, and gave birth to four sons, including American broadcast journalist and political commentator Anderson Cooper. She also had other relationships.

===Marriages===
In 1941, aged 17, Vanderbilt went to Hollywood, where she became the second wife of Pat DiCicco, an agent for actors and an alleged mobster. They divorced in 1945 and had no children together. She later alleged that DiCicco was an abusive husband who called her &quot;Fatsy Roo&quot; and beat her. &quot;He would take my head and bang it against the wall,&quot; Vanderbilt said, &quot;I had black eyes.&quot;

In April 1945, within weeks of divorcing DiCicco, Vanderbilt married conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was 42 years her senior. He had three daughters by his previous marriages to Olga Samaroff, an American concert pianist, and Evangeline Love Brewster Johnson, a Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress. She was his third and last wife. The marriage ended in divorce in October 1955 and produced two sons: Leopold Stanislaus &quot;Stan&quot; Stokowski (born August 22, 1950), and Christopher Stokowski (born January 31, 1952).

Vanderbilt&#x27;s third husband was the director Sidney Lumet. She was the second of his four wives. They were married on August 28, 1956, and divorced in August 1963. They had no children together.

Vanderbilt&#x27;s fourth marriage was to author Wyatt Emory Cooper, on December 24, 1963. The marriage, which lasted 15 years, ended with his death in 1978 while he was undergoing open-heart surgery. They had two sons: Carter Vanderbilt Cooper (January 27, 1965 – July 22, 1988), who died by suicide at age 23 by jumping to his death from the family&#x27;s 14th-floor apartment, and Anderson Hays Cooper (born June 3, 1967), a CNN news anchor.

===Relationships===
Vanderbilt maintained a romantic relationship with photographer and filmmaker Gordon Parks for many years until his death in 2006. Other relationships included Marlon Brando, Frank Sinatra, Howard Hughes and Roald Dahl.

Vanderbilt was very close friends with fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg. While appearing as a guest on her son Anderson Cooper&#x27;s television talk show, &quot;Anderson&quot; on September 19, 2011, Vanderbilt referred to comedian and actress Kathy Griffin as her &quot;fantasy daughter&quot;.

Truman Capote was speculated to have modeled the character of Holly Golightly in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; on Vanderbilt, but others say it was based on her friend Carol Grace.

===Religious beliefs===
Vanderbilt was baptized into the Episcopal Church as an infant, but was raised a Roman Catholic and received the Catholic Sacrament of Confirmation. She was particularly fascinated with St. Thérèse of Lisieux. Although religious in her youth, she was not a practicing Catholic in her later years.

===Death and burial===
Vanderbilt died at her home in Manhattan on June 17, 2019, aged 95, of stomach cancer. She is buried next to her son Carter and late husband Wyatt in the Cooper plot in the Vanderbilt Family Cemetery on Staten Island, New York.

Upon her death, Vanderbilt left her son, Anderson Cooper, $1.5 million of a total estate estimated to be worth $200 million.

<doc id="186383" wikidata="Q118551" url="?curid=186383" title="Clarithromycin">
<text>Clarithromycin, sold under the brand name Biaxin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. This includes strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection, and Lyme disease, among others. Clarithromycin can be taken by mouth as a tablet or liquid or can be infused intravenously.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and diarrhea. Severe allergic reactions are rare. Liver problems have been reported. It may cause harm if taken during pregnancy. It is in the macrolide class and works by slowing down bacterial protein synthesis. Clarithromycin resistance is already a major challenge to healthcare systems and such resistance is spreading, leading to recommendations to test the susceptibility of pathogenic organisms to the antibiotic before commencing clarithromycin therapy.
Clarithromycin was developed in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. It is made from erythromycin and is chemically known as 6-O-methylerythromycin.

==Medical uses==
===Antibiotic===
Clarithromycin is primarily used to treat a number of bacterial infections including pneumonia, &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, and as an alternative to penicillin in strep throat. Other uses include cat scratch disease and other infections due to Bartonella, cryptosporidiosis, as a second line agent in Lyme disease and toxoplasmosis. It may also be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in those who cannot take penicillin. It is effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and helicobacter pylori infections associated with duodenal ulcers.

==== Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility ====

Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;
Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria
* Haemophilus parainfluenzae 
* &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;
* &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;
Helicobacter
* Helicobacter pylori
Mycobacteria

Mycobacterium avium complex consisting of:
* Mycobacterium avium avium
* Mycobacterium intracellulare
Other bacteria
* &quot;Chlamydia pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;

Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in treating clinical infections due to the following bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials:

Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria
* Streptococcus agalactiae
* Streptococcus (Groups C, F, G)
* Viridans group streptococci
Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria
* Bordetella pertussis
* Legionella pneumophila
* Pasteurella multocida
Anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria
* Clostridium perfringens
* Peptococcus niger
* Cutibacterium acnes
Anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria
* Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus)

=== Idiopathic hypersomnia ===
Clarithromycin has been researched as a potential treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults, but the evidence is limited. A 2021 Cochrane study determined that the evidence is inadequate to definitively determine the efficacy of clarithromycin in the management of idiopathic hypersomnia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine&#x27;s 2021 clinical practice guidelines conditionally suggested its use, especially for those who don&#x27;t respond to other therapies.

== Contraindications ==
* Clarithromycin should not be taken by people who are allergic to other macrolides or inactive ingredients in the tablets, including microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, magnesium stearate, and povidone
* Clarithromycin should not be used by people with a history of cholestatic jaundice and/or liver dysfunction associated with prior clarithromycin use. 
* Clarithromycin should not be used in the setting of hypokalaemia (low blood potassium)
* Use of clarithromycin with the following medications: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, ticagrelor, ranolazine or dihydroergotamine is not recommended.
* It should not be used with colchicine in people with kidney or liver impairment.
* Concomitant use with cholesterol medications such as lovastatin or simvastatin.
* Hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any component of the product, erythromycin, or any macrolide antibiotics.
* QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes.

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhea (3%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting (6%). It also can cause headaches, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests. Allergic reactions include rashes and anaphylaxis. Less common side effects (&lt;1%) include extreme irritability, hallucinations (auditory and visual), dizziness/motion sickness, and alteration in senses of smell and taste, including a metallic taste. Dry mouth, panic attacks, and nightmares have also been reported, albeit less frequently.
===Cardiac===
In February 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication warning with respect to an increased risk for heart problems or death with the use of clarithromycin, and has recommended that alternative antibiotics be considered in those with heart disease.

Clarithromycin can lead to a prolonged QT interval. In patients with long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications, this can increase risk for life-threatening arrhythmias.

In one trial, the use of short-term clarithromycin treatment was correlated with an increased incidence of deaths classified as sudden cardiac deaths in stable coronary heart disease patients not using statins.

===Liver and kidney===
Clarithromycin has been known to cause jaundice, cirrhosis, and kidney problems, including kidney failure. Some case reports suspect it of causing liver disease.

===Central nervous system===
Common adverse effects of clarithromycin in the central nervous system include dizziness, headaches. Rarely, it can cause ototoxicity, delirium and mania.

===Infection===
A risk of oral candidiasis and vaginal candidiasis, due to the elimination of the yeast&#x27;s natural bacterial competitors by the antibiotic, has also been noted.

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===

Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in situations where no alternative therapy is appropriate. Clarithromycin can cause potential hazard to the fetus hence should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. For lactating mothers it is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk.

== Interactions ==
Clarithromycin inhibits a liver enzyme, CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism of many other commonly prescribed drugs. Taking clarithromycin with other medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may lead to unexpected increases or decreases in drug levels.

A few of the common interactions are listed below.

===Colchicine===
Clarithromycin has been observed to have a dangerous interaction with colchicine as the result of inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism and P-glycoprotein transport. Combining these two drugs may lead to fatal colchicine toxicity, particularly in people with chronic kidney disease.

===Statins===
Taking clarithromycin concurrently with certain statins (a class of drugs used to reduce blood serum cholesterol levels) increases the risk of side effects, such as muscle aches and muscle break down (rhabdomyolysis).

===Calcium channel blockers===
Concurrent therapy with calcium channel blocker may increase risk of low blood pressure, kidney failure, and death, compared to pairing calcium channel blockers with azithromycin, a drug similar to clarithromycin but without CYP3A4 inhibition. Administration of clarithromycin in combination with verapamil have been observed to cause low blood pressure, low heart rate, and lactic acidosis.

===Carbamazepine===
Clarithromycin may double the level of carbamazepine in the body by reducing its clearance, which may lead to toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as double vision, loss of voluntary body movement, and nausea, as well as hyponatremia.

===HIV medications===
Depending on the combination of medications, clarithromycin therapy could be contraindicated, require changing doses of some medications, or be acceptable without dose adjustments. For example, clarithromycin may lead to decreased zidovudine concentrations.

==Pharmacology==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Clarithromycin prevents bacteria from multiplying by acting as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to 23S rRNA, a component of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting the translation of peptides.

In addition to its antibiotic activity, clarithromycin has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. In relation to this action, it may have wakefulness-promoting effects in people with hypersomnia.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Unlike erythromycin, clarithromycin is acid-stable, so can be taken orally without having to be protected from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, clarithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of clarithromycin are released; its concentration in the tissues can be over 10 times higher than in plasma. Highest concentrations are found in liver, lung tissue, and stool.

==== Metabolism ====
Clarithromycin has a fairly rapid first-pass metabolism in the liver. Its major metabolites include an inactive metabolite, N-desmethylclarithromycin, and an active metabolite, . Compared to clarithromycin, is less potent against mycobacterial tuberculosis and the &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex. Clarithromycin (20%-40%) and its active metabolite (10%-15%) are excreted in urine. Of all the drugs in its class, clarithromycin has the best bioavailability at 50%, which makes it amenable to oral administration. 
Its elimination half-life is about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 h, but increased to 5 to 7 h with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 h. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days.

== History ==
Clarithromycin was invented by researchers at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in 1980. The product emerged through efforts to develop a version of the antibiotic erythromycin that did not experience acid instability in the digestive tract, causing side effects, such as nausea and stomachache. Taisho filed for patent protection for the drug around 1980 and subsequently introduced a branded version of its drug, called Clarith, to the Japanese market in 1991. In 1985, Taisho partnered with the American company Abbott Laboratories for the international rights, and Abbott also gained FDA approval for Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005.

==Society and culture==
=== Available forms ===
Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. In the United States, clarithromycin is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and granules for oral suspension.

=== Brand names ===
Clarithromycin is available under several brand names in many different countries, including Biaxin, Crixan, Claritron, Clarihexal, Clacid, Claritt, Clacee, Clarac, Clariwin, Claripen, Clarem, Claridar, Cloff, Fromilid, Infex, Kalixocin, Karicin, Klaricid, Klaridex, Klacid, Klaram, Klabax, Klerimed, MegaKlar, Monoclar, Resclar, Rithmo, Truclar, Vikrol and Zeclar.

=== Manufacturers ===
In the UK the drug product is manufactured in generic form by a number of manufacturers including Somex Pharma, Ranbaxy, Aptil and Sandoz.
== Research ==
=== Hypersomnolence ===
Clarithromycin has been studied in a phase 2 clinical trial in the treatment of central hypersomnolence (i.e., idiopathic hypersomnolence and narcolepsy without cataplexy). There was no apparent improvement on an objective measure of vigilance, but subjective sleepiness was reduced with the drug compared to placebo. It is thought to work for this use as a GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulator.

<text>251 Menlove Avenue is the childhood home of the Beatles&#x27; John Lennon. Located in the Woolton suburb of Liverpool, it was named Mendips after the Mendip Hills. The Grade II listed building is preserved by the National Trust.

==Residence of John Lennon==
The 1933-built semi-detached property, which belonged to John Lennon&#x27;s aunt Mimi and her husband George Smith, is in Woolton, south Liverpool. Lennon moved there in July 1946 at the age of five from 9 Newcastle Road in the nearby suburb of Wavertree. He lived at Mendips after his mother, who was living with her boyfriend, was persuaded that it would be better for his Aunt Mimi and George to take care of him. He remained at Mendips until mid-1963, when he was 22 years old. It was approximately 30 metres north west of this house that Lennon&#x27;s mother Julia was hit by a car and killed on the evening of 15 July 1958.

In 1965 Mimi sold the property, taking away some of the furnishings and giving away others.

==National Trust acquisition==

Despite having purchased 20 Forthlin Road, the childhood residence of Paul McCartney, the National Trust showed no interest in acquiring Mendips, claiming that, unlike McCartney&#x27;s home, no Beatles songs had been composed there. However, McCartney recalls at least one song, &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You&quot;, being written there. &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was also written there.

During the filming of the American TV film &quot;In His Life: The John Lennon Story&quot; in 2000, the then-owner of the house allowed the film crew inside, and also allowed them to knock down a downstairs wall to make room for the cameras. This resulted in 150 bricks being removed, which were later sold to Beatles fans.

On 7 December 2000, the day before the 20th anniversary of John Lennon&#x27;s death, 251 Menlove Avenue was adorned with an English Heritage blue plaque, carrying the text &quot;JOHN LENNON 1940–1980 Musician and Songwriter lived here 1945–1963&quot;.

Lennon&#x27;s widow Yoko Ono bought the house in March 2002, and donated it to the National Trust in order to save it from further demolition and property speculators. The house was then restored to its 1950s appearance. At a joint press conference with the National Trust in March 2003, when it was announced that the restoration work was finished and the house would be opened to the public, Yoko Ono said: &quot;When John&#x27;s house came up for sale I wanted to preserve it for the people of Liverpool and John Lennon and Beatles fans all over the world.&quot;

Every year on the anniversary of his death, the National Trust leave the bedroom light on in John Lennon&#x27;s childhood home, all night.

In February 2012, both this house and Paul McCartney&#x27;s childhood home at 20 Forthlin Road were Grade II listed by English Heritage.

==In popular culture==
* The house is featured on the sleeve of Oasis&#x27; single &quot;Live Forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME/Oasis&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;Menlove Ave.&quot; is a John Lennon album, posthumously released in 1986 under the supervision of Yoko Ono.

<text>The Durutti Column are an English rock band formed in 1978 in Manchester, England. The band is the project of guitarist and occasional pianist Vini Reilly who is often accompanied by Bruce Mitchell on drums and Keir Stewart on bass, keyboards and harmonica. They were among the first acts signed to Factory Records by label founder Tony Wilson.

==History==
===Early line-ups===
In 1978, Tony Wilson and Alan Erasmus, later partners in Factory Records, assembled a band around the remnants of local punk rock band Fast Breeder, specifically drummer Chris Joyce and guitarist Dave Rowbotham. The name was derived from a misspelling of the Durruti Column, an anarchist military unit in the Spanish Civil War, named after Buenaventura Durruti. The name was also taken from a four-page comic strip entitled &quot;Le Retour de la Colonne Durruti&quot; (&quot;The Return Of The Durruti Column&quot;) by André Bertrand, which was handed out amidst student protests in October 1966 at Strasbourg University.

On 25 January, Vini Reilly, former guitarist for local punk rock band Ed Banger and the Nosebleeds, joined, followed some weeks later by co-member vocalist Phil Rainford and, by the end of February, bassist Tony Bowers arrived from Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias. The line-up was short-lived as Rainford was sacked in July, and replaced by actor Colin Sharp, who also became one of the songwriters. Rainford went on to produce for Nico and Suns of Arqa.

The Durutti Column played at the Factory club (organised by their managers), and cut two numbers for the first Factory Records release &quot;A Factory Sample&quot;, a double 7&quot; compilation also featuring Joy Division, John Dowie and Cabaret Voltaire. On the eve of recording a debut album, the band broke up after a dispute about Wilson and Erasmus&#x27;s choice of producer, Martin Hannett. Rowbotham, Bowers and Joyce went on to form The Mothmen (the latter two becoming members of Simply Red some years later), Sharp went on to form The Roaring 80s, SF Jive, and Glow, and also dedicated himself to acting; only Reilly remained.

With everyone&#x27;s departure, The Durutti Column defaulted to Reilly&#x27;s solo project. Other musicians contributed to recordings and live performances as occasioned. Former Alberto Y Lost Trios Paranoias drummer Bruce Mitchell doubled as co-manager with Wilson throughout their career on Factory and for many years afterward.

===1979–1990: Factory Records===
The first album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;The Return of the Durutti Column&quot; (title inspired by a 1967 Situationist International poster that includes that phrase), was produced by Martin Hannett. Reilly: &quot;...he more or less got sounds for me that no one else could understand that I wanted. And he understood that I wanted to play the electric guitar but I didn&#x27;t want this horrible distorted, usual electric guitar sound and he managed to get that.&quot; The record featured a sandpaper sleeve (like the title of the record, inspired by a Situationist joke, a book – Guy Debord&#x27;s &quot;Mémoires&quot; – with a sandpaper cover to destroy other books on the shelf). &quot;I didn&#x27;t even know it was going to be an album. It was just the case of jumping at the chance of being in the studio. I actually didn&#x27;t get up in time, Martin had to physically get me out of bed to get me to the studio – that&#x27;s how little I believed it would happen. I was still doing late night petrol station shifts. I was even more amazed when Tony presented me with a white label. I was completely baffled. &#x27;What, this is really going to be an album? You must be insane! No-one&#x27;s going to buy this!&#x27; And then Tony got the idea from the Situationists about the sandpaper book, and decided to do some with a sandpaper sleeve. It was Joy Division that stuck the sandpaper onto the card. I was mortified.&quot;

The music was unlike anything else performed by post-punk acts at the time. Reilly rooted himself in &quot;new wave&quot; with &quot;...an attempt at experimental things&quot;; the record contained nine gentle guitar instrumentals (later releases occasionally feature Reilly&#x27;s soft and hesitant vocals) including elements from jazz, folk, classical music and rock. Reilly: &quot;...I had a lot of classical training when I was young, guitar and formal training, the scales I write with and the techniques I use are classical techniques and scales – a lot of minor melodic and minor harmonic scales, which generally aren&#x27;t used in pop music. Usually it&#x27;s pentatonic&quot;. Hannett&#x27;s production included adding electronic rhythm and other effects, including birdsong on &quot;Sketch for Summer&quot;. The album was accompanied by a flexidisc with two tracks by Hannett alone.

&quot;LC&quot; (&quot;Lotta Continua&quot;, Italian for &quot;continuous struggle&quot;), released in 1981, was recorded without Hannett, and introduced percussionist Bruce Mitchell, Reilly&#x27;s most frequent musical partner and occasional manager. It was recorded on a four-track cassette deck at home (while it was slightly padded in the studio, the tape hiss is intact); among the first crisp, professionally released recordings made cheaply at home. The EP &quot;Deux Triangles&quot;, released in 1982, contained three instrumentals, with piano emphasised over guitar. &quot;Another Setting&quot; (1983) was again Reilly and Mitchell; in 1984, the band was expanded to include Richard Henry (trombone), Maunagh Fleming (cor anglais and oboe), Blaine Reininger (of Tuxedomoon; violin and viola), Mervyn Fletcher (saxophone), Caroline Lavelle (cello), and Tim Kellett (trumpet). The album &quot;Without Mercy&quot;, arranged by John Metcalfe, was intended as an instrumental evocation of the poem &quot;La Belle Dame sans Merci&quot; by John Keats.

&quot;Say What You Mean&quot; was a departure from roots with the addition of deep electronic percussion. Kellett and Metcalfe remained (Metcalfe playing viola); they also appear alongside Reilly and Mitchell on &quot;Circuses and Bread&quot; (Factory Benelux in 1985) and &quot;Domo Arigato&quot;. The latter is a live album recorded in Tokyo and the first pop album released in the UK solely on the relatively new compact disc format (and also available on VHS and LaserDisc.)

Kellett left to join Simply Red, but guested on &quot;The Guitar and Other Machines&quot; (1987), the first new UK album to be released on Digital Audio Tape (as well as the usual media of LP, audio cassette and CD). &quot;The Guitar and Other Machines&quot; has a far more direct sound than earlier records, with guest vocals from Stanton Miranda and Reilly&#x27;s then partner, Pol, and the use of a sequencer and drum machine in addition to Mitchell&#x27;s drumming. The album was produced by Stephen Street, who also produced Morrissey&#x27;s solo album &quot;Viva Hate&quot; (1988), on which Reilly played guitar. Reilly has said he was neither properly credited nor compensated for composing most of the music on &quot;Viva Hate&quot;.

&quot;Vini Reilly&quot; (1989), also produced by Reilly and Street, features extensive use of sampling, with looped samples of vocalists (including Otis Redding, Tracy Chapman, Annie Lennox and Joan Sutherland) used as the basis for several tracks. Initial copies came with a 7&quot; or CD single, &quot;I Know Very Well How I Got My Note Wrong&quot;, credited to &quot;Vincent Gerard and Steven Patrick&quot;, in which a take of the Morrissey B-side &quot;I Know Very Well How I Got My Name&quot; dissolves into laughter after Reilly hits a wrong note.

On &quot;Obey the Time&quot; (1990), Mitchell played on only one track, the album being otherwise a solo recording by Reilly, heavily influenced by contemporary dance music. The album&#x27;s title is a phrase uttered by the titular character of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; toward his fiance, Desdemona in Act One, Scene Two: &quot;I have but an hour of love, of worldly matters and direction, To spend with thee: we must obey the time.&quot; An accompanying single, &quot;The Together Mix&quot;, featured two reworkings of album tracks by Together, Jonathon Donaghy and Suddi Raval (Donaghy was killed in a car crash in Ibiza before the single was released). This was to be the last Durutti Column record released by Factory, in early 1991.

===1990 onward: after Factory===

For the first few years after the demise of Factory, the only Durutti Column album releases were &quot;Lips That Would Kiss&quot; (a 1991 collection of early singles, compilation contributions and unreleased material on the separate label Factory Benelux), and &quot;Dry&quot; (1991) and &quot;Red Shoes&quot; (1992), Italian collections of alternate versions and unreleased outtakes.

Former member Dave Rowbotham was killed by an unknown assailant in 1991. He was later memorialised by the Happy Mondays in the song &quot;Cowboy Dave&quot;.

In 1993, Tony Wilson attempted to revive Factory Records, and &quot;Sex and Death&quot; was the first release on Factory Too (a subdivision of London Records). The album was once again produced by Stephen Street, with Mitchell and Metcalfe, and it included, on the track &quot;The Next Time&quot;, Peter Hook of New Order. &quot;Time Was Gigantic ... When We Were Kids&quot;, which followed in 1998, was produced by Keir Stewart, who also played on the album and has frequently worked with Reilly since. &quot;Fidelity&quot; was released between these albums in 1996 by Les Disques du Crépuscule and was produced by Laurie Laptop.

The eight albums recorded for Factory (&quot;The Return of the Durutti Column&quot;, &quot;LC&quot;, &quot;Another Setting&quot;, &quot;Without Mercy&quot;, &quot;Domo Arigato&quot;, &quot;The Guitar and Other Machines&quot;, &quot;Vini Reilly&quot; and &quot;Obey the Time&quot;) were re-released with additional material by Factory Too/London, under the banner Factory Once, between 1996 and 1998.

In 1998, Durutti Column contributed &quot;It&#x27;s Your Life Baby&quot; to the AIDS benefit compilation album &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Factory Too effectively ended in 1998, and subsequent Durutti Column albums have been on independent labels Artful Records (&quot;Rebellion&quot; [2001], &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Party&quot; [2003], &quot;Keep Breathing&quot; [2006], &quot;Idiot Savants&quot; [2007]) or Kookydisc (&quot;Tempus Fugit&quot; [2004], &quot;Sunlight to Blue . . . Blue to Blackness&quot; [2008]). Kookydisc has also released two further volumes of &quot;The Sporadic Recordings&quot; (along with a slightly edited re-release of the first volume from 1989), remastered versions of two very scarce LPs from the early 1980s (&quot;Live At The Venue&quot; [2004] and &quot;Amigos Em Portugal&quot; [2005]), and two subscription-club discs of rare and unreleased material. A download-only release, &quot;Heaven Sent (It Was Called Digital, It Was Heaven Sent)&quot;, first appeared in 2005 via Wilson&#x27;s project F4, which was marketed as the fourth version of Factory Records.

A short Jeff Noon play adapted for BBC Radio 3, Dead Code - Ghosts of the Digital Age (BBC Radio 3, 2005), was partially soundtracked by The Durutti Column.

On 7 September 2009, Colin Sharp died from a brain haemorrhage. Reilly suffered a stroke in 2011, following which he was left unable to play the guitar the way he did before.

==Phil Rainford==
Phil Rainford is a British former singer and music producer, who formed part of the Manchester music scene, in late 1970s and early 1980s. He was the original singer of post-punk band The Durutti Column who were signed to Factory Records, having joined the band in early 1978. 

He was sacked in July of that year, for not being a considered correct choice. He did not release any material with the band other than a couple of pieces on a Factory Records sample release. At the time he was also known as &quot;Phil Raincoat&quot;.

Phil Rainford later reappeared as producer for two albums for singer Nico: &quot;Live Heroes&quot; and &quot;Femme Fatale&quot;. He engineered and mixed another Nico&#x27;s live album, &quot;Do or Die: Diary 1982&quot;. Phil is one of the &quot;stars&quot;/driver in James Young&#x27;s book about Nico&#x27;s time in Manchester and touring Europe &quot;Songs they Never Play on the Radio&quot;. He also mixed the &quot;Musical Revue&quot; album for Suns of Arqa, also known as &quot;Live with Prince Far-I&quot;, although his surname is curiously misspelled &#x27;Qainford&#x27; on the credits.

<text>The Name of the Rose ( ) is the 1980 debut novel by Italian author Umberto Eco. It is a historical murder mystery set in an Italian monastery in the year 1327, and an intellectual mystery combining semiotics in fiction, biblical analysis, medieval studies, and literary theory. It was translated into English by William Weaver in 1983.

The novel has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling books ever published. It has received many international awards and accolades, such as the Strega Prize in 1981 and in 1982, and was ranked 14th on &#x27;s 100 Books of the Century list.

== Plot summary ==
In 1327, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville and his assistant Adso of Melk arrive at a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy to attend a theological disputation. The abbey is being used as neutral ground in a dispute between Pope John XXII and the Franciscans over the question of apostolic poverty. The monks of the abbey have recently been shaken by the suspicious death of one of their brothers, Adelmo of Otranto, and the abbot asks William (a former inquisitor) to investigate the incident. During his inquiries, William has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the permissibility of laughter, which Jorge regards as a threat to God&#x27;s established order.

The second day, another monk, Venantius of Salvemec, is found dead in a vat of pig&#x27;s blood. He has black stains on his tongue and fingers, suggesting poison. William learns that Adelmo was part of a homosexual love triangle that also involved the librarian, Malachi of Hildesheim, and Malachi&#x27;s assistant, Berengar of Arundel. The only other monks who knew about these indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius. In spite of Malachi&#x27;s ban, William and Adso enter the abbey&#x27;s labyrinthine library. They discover that the library contains a hidden room named the after the presumed edge of the world, but they are unable to locate it. In the scriptorium, they find a book on Venantius&#x27;s desk along with some cryptic notes. Someone snatches the book and they pursue to no avail.

The third day, the monks are surprised by the disappearance of Berengar and William learns that there are two former Dulcinians in the abbey (Remigio of Voragine, the abbey&#x27;s cellarer, and the deformed monk Salvatore). Adso returns to the library alone in the evening. While leaving the library through the kitchen, he is seduced by a peasant girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty.

The fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in the abbey&#x27;s bathhouse. His fingers and tongue bear stains similar to those found on Venantius. The pope&#x27;s legation now arrives, led by Grand Inquisitor Bernard Gui. Salvatore is discovered attempting to cast a primitive love spell on the peasant girl, and Bernard arrests them both for witchcraft and heresy.

The fifth day is the day of the disputation. Severinus, the abbey&#x27;s herbalist, tells William that he has found a &quot;strange book&quot; that demands the friar&#x27;s attention, but William is unable to investigate the discovery until the disputation has ended. When William and Adso arrive at Severinus&#x27;s laboratory, they find him dead, his skull crushed by a heavy armillary sphere. They search the room for the missing book but are unable to locate it. Remigio is discovered at the scene of the crime and taken into custody by Bernard, who accuses the &quot;heretic&quot; of committing all four homicides. Under threat of torture, Remigio confesses. Remigio, Salvatore, and the peasant girl are taken away and assumed to be doomed. In response to the recent tragedies in the abbey, Jorge gives an apocalyptic sermon about the coming of the Antichrist.

At matins the morning of the sixth day, Malachi drops dead, his fingers and tongue black. The abbot is distraught at William&#x27;s failure to solve the crimes and orders him to leave the abbey the following day. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more and enter the by solving Venantius&#x27;s riddle. They discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. William has by now arrived at a solution. Berengar revealed the existence of the to Adelmo in exchange for a sexual favour. Adelmo, stricken with guilt over this sinful bargain, then committed suicide. Venantius overheard the secret and used it to gain possession of a rare and valuable book that Jorge had hidden in the room. Unbeknownst to him, Jorge had laced its pages with poison, correctly assuming that a reader would have to lick his fingers in order to turn them. Venantius&#x27;s body was discovered by Berengar, who, fearing exposure, disposed of it in pig&#x27;s blood before claiming the book and succumbing to its poison. The book was next found by Severinus, but Jorge manipulated Malachi into killing him before he could pass it on to William. Malachi died after ignoring Jorge&#x27;s warning not to investigate the book&#x27;s contents. The book itself, now back in Jorge&#x27;s possession, is the lost second half of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, which discusses the virtues of laughter.

Jorge confirms William&#x27;s deductions and justifies himself by pointing to the fact that the deaths correspond to the seven trumpets described in the Book of Revelation, and therefore must form part of a divine plan. Two more deaths will complete the sequence: that of the abbot, whom Jorge has trapped in an airless passageway beneath the , and that of Jorge himself. He begins consuming the book&#x27;s poisoned pages and uses Adso&#x27;s lantern to start a fire in the library.

Adso summons the monks in a futile attempt to extinguish the fire. As the fire consumes the library and spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and salvages any remaining scraps and fragments, eventually creating a lesser library.

== Major themes ==
Eco was a professor of semiotics, and employed techniques of metanarrative, partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of Aristotle&#x27;s book on Comedy, which has been lost. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths – an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters. In this regard, the conclusion mimics a novel of ideas, with William representing rationality, investigation, logical deduction, empiricism and also the beauty of the human minds, against Jorge&#x27;s dogmatism, censoriousness, and pursuit of keeping, no matter the cost, the secrets of the library closed and hidden to the outside world, including the other monks of the abbey.

&quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; has been described as a work of postmodernism. The quote in the novel, &quot;books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told&quot;, refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his &quot;Postscript to the Name of the Rose&quot;, &quot;very little is discovered and the detective is defeated.&quot; After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there &quot;was no pattern.&quot; Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the nominal plot—that of a detective story—broken, the series of deaths following a chaotic pattern of multiple causes, accident, and arguably without inherent meaning.

== The &#x27;s labyrinth ==
The mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the . This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and refectory, the first floor a scriptorium, and the top floor is occupied by the library. The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where manuscripts are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.

The has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms. Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the Book of Revelation. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room. The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. Hibernia in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:

* , &#x27;The earthly paradise&#x27; contains Bibles and commentaries, East Tower
* , Greece, Northeast
* , Judea, East
* , Egypt, Southeast
* , &#x27;South&#x27; contains books from Africa, South Tower
* , Spain, Southwest outer
* , Italy, Southwest inner
* , Ireland, West Tower
* , France, Northwest
* , Germany, North
* , England, North Tower
Two rooms have no lettering – the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called , which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.

== Title ==
Much attention has been paid to the mystery of what the book&#x27;s title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a &quot;totally neutral title&quot;. In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title &quot;Adso of Melk&quot;, but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; &quot;came to me virtually by chance.&quot; In the &quot;Postscript to the Name of the Rose&quot;, Eco claims to have chosen the title &quot;because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left&quot;.

The book&#x27;s last line, &quot;&quot; translates as: &quot;the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names.&quot; The general sense, as Eco pointed out, was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost &quot;rose&quot; could be seen as Aristotle&#x27;s book on comedy (this part of his Poetics is now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.

This text has also been translated as &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names.&quot; This line is a verse by twelfth century monk Bernard of Cluny (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim, but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to Rome (), not to a rose (). The alternative text, with its context, runs: . This translates as &quot;Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names&quot;.

The title may also be an allusion to the nominalist position in the problem of universals, taken by William of Ockham. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only a bunch of particular flowers that we artificially singled out by naming them &quot;roses&quot;.

A further possible inspiration for the title may be a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695):
&lt;poem lang=es&gt;
Rosa que al prado, encarnada,
te ostentas presuntuosa
de grana y carmín bañada:
campa lozana y gustosa;
pero no, que siendo hermosa
también serás desdichada.
&lt;/poem&gt;

This poem appears in Eco&#x27;s &quot;Postscript to the Name of the Rose&quot;, and is translated into English in &quot;Note 1&quot; of that book as:

&lt;poem&gt;
Red rose growing in the meadow,
bravely you vaunt thyself
in crimson and carmine bathed:
displayed in rich and growing state.
But no: as precious as thou may seem,
Not happy soon thou shall be.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Allusions ==
=== To other works ===
The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (compare &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; – also, Adso&#x27;s description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson&#x27;s description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;) and to William of Ockham (see the next section). The name of the novice, Adso of Melk, refers to Melk Abbey, the site of a famous medieval library. Further, his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last letters).

The blind librarian Jorge of Burgos is a nod to Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of Argentina&#x27;s national library; his short story &quot;The Library of Babel&quot; is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco&#x27;s book. Another of Borges&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Secret Miracle&quot;, features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges&#x27;s works are used throughout &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;: labyrinths, mirrors, sects, and obscure manuscripts and books.

The ending also owes a debt to Borges&#x27;s short story &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;, in which a detective proposes a theory for the behaviour of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, the librarian Jorge uses William&#x27;s belief that the murders are based on the Revelation to John to misdirect William, though in Eco&#x27;s tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.

The &quot;poisoned page&quot; motif may have been inspired by Alexandre Dumas&#x27; novel (1845). It was also used in the film (1963) by Italian director Dino Risi. A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot;, translated as &quot;The Golden Lotus&quot; or &quot;The Plum in the Golden Vase&quot;.

Eco seems also to have been aware of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s short story &quot;The Eye of Allah&quot;, which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church&#x27;s attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.

Eco was also inspired by the 19th century Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni, citing &quot;The Betrothed&quot; as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.

Throughout the book, there are Latin quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of Aristotle and of a variety of millenarist heresies, especially those associated with the fraticelli. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including Wittgenstein.

=== To actual history and geography ===

The book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a Benedictine abbey during the controversy surrounding the doctrines about absolute poverty of Christ and apostolic poverty between branches of Franciscans and Dominicans; (see renewed controversy on the question of poverty). The setting was inspired by monumental Saint Michael&#x27;s Abbey in Susa Valley, Piedmont and visited by Umberto Eco.

The book highlights tensions that existed within Christianity during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects, such as the Dulcinians, began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV and Pope John XXII, with the Pope condemning the Spirituals and the Emperor supporting them as proxies in a larger power struggle at the time over authorities claimed by both the Church and Empire. The novel takes place during the Avignon Papacy and in his Prologue, Adso mentions the election of anti-king Frederick of Austria as a rival claimant to Emperor Louis thirteen years before the story begins. Adso&#x27;s &quot;Last Page&quot; epilogue describes the Emperor&#x27;s appointment of Nicholas V as anti-Pope in Rome shortly after Louis IV abandoned reconciliation with John XXII (a decision Adso connects with the disastrous events of the novel&#x27;s theological conference).

A number of the characters, such as Bernard Gui, Ubertino of Casale and the Franciscan Michael of Cesena, are historical figures, though Eco&#x27;s characterization of them is not always historically accurate. His portrayal of Bernard Gui in particular has been widely criticized by historians as a caricature; Edward Peters has stated that the character is &quot;rather more sinister and notorious ... than he ever was historically&quot;, and he and others have argued that the character is actually based on the grotesque portrayals of inquisitors and Catholic prelates more broadly in eighteenth and nineteenth-century Gothic literature, such as Matthew Gregory Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&quot; (1796). Additionally, part of the novel&#x27;s dialogue is derived from Gui&#x27;s inquisitor&#x27;s manual, the . In the inquisition scene, the character of Gui asks the cellarer Remigius, &quot;What do you believe?&quot;, to which Remigius replies, &quot;What do you believe, my Lord?&quot; Gui responds, &quot;I believe in all that the Creed teaches&quot;, and Remigius tells him, &quot;So I believe, my Lord.&quot; Bernard then points out that Remigius is not claiming to believe in the Creed, but to believe that he, &quot;Gui&quot;, believes in the Creed; this is a paraphrased example from Gui&#x27;s inquisitor&#x27;s manual, used to warn inquisitors of the manipulative tendencies of heretics.

Adso&#x27;s description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at Moissac, France. Dante Alighieri and his &quot;Comedy&quot; are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous &quot;Umberto of Bologna&quot; – Umberto Eco himself.

== Errors ==
Some historical errors present are most likely part of the literary artifice, whose contextualization is documented in the pages of the book preceding the Prologue, in which the author states that the manuscript on which the current Italian translation was later carried out contained interpolations due to different authors from the Middle Ages to the Modern Era. Eco also personally reported some errors and anachronisms present in various editions of the novel until the revision of 2011:

* The novel mentions bell peppers, first in a recipe (&quot;sheep meat with raw pepper sauce&quot;), then in a dream of Adso, but it is an &quot;impossible dish&quot;. These peppers were in fact imported from the Americas over a century and a half after the time in which the novel takes place. The same error is repeated later when Adso dreams of a reworking of the Coena Cypriani, in which among the different foods that guests bring to the table appear, in fact, also the peppers.
* During the seventh day-night, Jorge tells Guglielmo that Francis of Assisi &quot;imitated with a piece of wood the movements of the player violin&quot;, an instrument that did not exist before the 16th century.
* At one point in the novel Adso claims to have done something in &quot;a few seconds&quot; when that time measure was not yet used in the Middle Ages.

Moreover, still present in the Note before the Prologue, in which Eco tries to place the liturgical and canonical hours:

If it is assumed, as logical, that Eco referred to the local mean time, the estimate of the beginning of the hour before dawn and the beginning of Vespers (sunset), so those in the final lines (&quot;dawn and sunset around 7.30 and 4.40 in the afternoon&quot;), giving a duration from dawn to noon equal to or less than that from noon to dusk, is the opposite of what happens at the end of November (it is an incorrect application of the equation of time).

<text>Vaughan (also Vaughans or Vaughn) is an unincorporated community in Yazoo County, Mississippi.

The settlement is east of Yazoo City.

==History==
Vaughan was founded in 1830 and named for Henry Vaughan, who had established a plantation nearby. The town was established on an old stagecoach line and was for many years the main trading center of Yazoo County, including a large part of Madison County east of the Big Black River.

==Casey Jones&#x27; railroad accident==
The famous railroad accident that killed 37-year-old engineer Casey Jones happened near Vaughan in the early morning hours of April 30, 1900. On July 24, 1953, a ceremony was held at Vaughan, where more than 3,000 persons gathered to witness the unveiling of a bronze marker at the spot where Casey met his fate. In attendance were Sim Webb, Casey&#x27;s fireman, and Janie Jones, Casey&#x27;s widow. Beneath Casey&#x27;s name, the following legend appeared: &quot;A famous ballad, the folklore of American railroading, and a postage stamp commemorate the colorful and courageous engineer who was killed in a wreck here in 1900.&quot; The marker is now missing; however, the marker&#x27;s post remains and can be found at the following coordinates: . No plans by the State of Mississippi have been made to replace it.

The Casey Jones Railroad Museum State Park at Vaughan was designated a State Park on April 27, 1980. The museum began as a project of Massena Jones (no relation) in a building he owned across the road from the present site. The centerpiece of it was the damaged bell that was salvaged from the wreck site. In 2004 the museum closed, and years later, the depot was moved to West, Mississippi.

==Education==
Residents are a part of the Yazoo County School District, and are zoned to Linwood Elementary School (in Vaughan), Yazoo County Middle School and Yazoo County High School.

<doc id="186403" wikidata="Q7689542" url="?curid=186403" title="Taxation in Japan">
<text>Taxation in Japan is based primarily upon a national income tax () and a () based upon one&#x27;s area of residence. There are consumption taxes and excise taxes at the national level, an enterprise tax and a vehicle tax at the prefectural level and a property tax at the municipal level.

Taxes are administered by the National Tax Agency.

==Consumption tax==
The Liberal Democratic Party government of Masayoshi Ōhira had attempted to introduce a consumption tax in 1979. Ohira met a lot of opposition within his own party and gave up on his attempt after his party suffered badly in the 1979 election. Ten years later, Noboru Takeshita successfully negotiated with politicians, bureaucrats, business and labor unions to introduce a consumption tax, which was introduced at a rate of 3% consumption tax in 1989.

In April 1997, under the government of Ryutaro Hashimoto it was increased to 5%. The 5% is made up of a 4% national consumption tax and a 1% local consumption tax. Shortly after the tax was introduced, Japan fell into recession, which was blamed by some on the consumption tax increase, and by others on the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Prime Minister Jun&#x27;ichirō Koizumi said he had no intention of raising the tax during his government, but after his massive victory in the 2005 election he lifted a ban on discussing it. Over the following years a number of LDP politicians discussed raising it further, including prime ministers Shinzō Abe, Yasuo Fukuda, and Tarō Asō.

The Democratic Party of Japan came to power in the August 2009 elections with a promise not to raise the consumption tax for four years. The first DPJ prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama was opposed to a tax increase. Naoto Kan replaced him and called for the consumption tax to be raised. The following prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda &quot;staked his political life&quot; on raising the tax. Despite an internal battle that saw former DPJ leader and co-founder Ichirō Ozawa and many other DPJ diet members vote against the bill and then leave the party, on June 26, 2012, the lower house of the Japanese diet passed a bill to double the tax to 10%. The new bill increased the tax to 8% in April 2014 and 10% in October 2015.

Due to Japan&#x27;s economic situation, the Abe government delayed the tax increase to 10% twice; initially until April 2017 and then October 2019.
The Qualified Invoice is scheduled to implement on which the revised Consumption Tax Law comes into effect in October, 2023. 
A registered seller has a duty to issue a Qualified Invoice to a buyer when making a taxable transaction in selling goods or rendering services. Whereas the Qualified Invoice being recorded in bookkeeping and thereafter having been kept by a buyer, a consumption tax imposed on the taxable purchase may be eligible to deduct for his consumption tax return.

==Income tax==
===Controversial tax law===
There is a spouse deduction that some have argued discourages men and women from entering the workforce full-time. In Japan, the Wall of 1.03 million yen and 1.30 million yen (103万円・130万円の壁) is a controversial social phenomenon among Japanese spouses due to the government&#x27;s taxation policy. If a spouse&#x27;s income is in excess of 1.03 million yen, which constitutes a taxable income of 380,000 yen, the couple can take the . If a spouse&#x27;s income is in excess of 1.30 million yen, which constitutes a taxable income of 760,000 yen, a couple cannot take the . A couple is not eligible for the marital deduction if the main earner&#x27;s income is in excess of 10 million yen.

The Japanese income tax system has a progressive tax rate, that increases in stages as income increases.

The method of tax payment differs between those who work for a company and those who do business on their own.

The company you work for deducts income tax from your salary in advance and collectively pays the tax on your behalf, which is called &quot;源泉徴収(Gensen choshu)&quot;.

Calculating one&#x27;s own income and tax for the year and filing a tax return with the tax office is called &quot;確定申告(kakutei shinkoku)&quot;.

===Hometown tax===
Since 2008, Japanese taxpayers have been allowed to pay 2,000 yen to redirect a portion of their income tax to one of the regions, instead of central government. Despite the name, there is no obligation for this to be the taxpayer&#x27;s &quot;home town&quot;. As the regions compete to win these taxes by offering &quot;gifts&quot; of various products and services in exchange, the result is that many taxpayers end up using it to buy products at a lower price. For example, a donation of 2,000 yen can produce a &quot;gift&quot; of 60 kg of rice, equivalent to an adult&#x27;s annual consumption.

==Inheritance tax==
In Japan, inheritance tax is levied on individual heirs, not on the deceased&#x27;s estate as a whole. Inheritance tax must be filed within 10 months of death.

The tax is levied at a progressive rate (up to 55%) based on the fair market value of the estate or inherited assets minus funeral expenses and any debts, exemptions, or allowances related to the inherited assets.

Tax rates vary and depend on the amount of property or assets received.

There are several exemptions and tax credits associated with inheritance tax.

Excluding the basic exemptions, other possible tax exemptions available are:

* Donations of property to certain non-profit organizations or public institutions
* ¥5 million retirement allowance per legal heir
* Life insurance benefits of ¥5 million per legal heir

Eligible tax credits include:

* For heirs under 20 years of age: ¥100.000 x (age of heir)
* For disabled heirs: ¥100.000 x (age of heir)
* In the case of a special disabled heir: ¥200.000 x (heir&#x27;s age)
* Foreign tax credit is also available (to avoid double taxation)

==Corporation tax==

Taxes imposed in Japan on income derived from corporate activities include:

* Corporate tax (national tax)
* Local corporate tax (national tax)
* Inhabitant tax (local tax)
* Enterprise tax (local tax)
* Special local corporate tax (national tax) (However, declared and paid to the local government together with enterprise tax)

==Alcohol tax==
Japanese alcohol tax is the one on alcoholic beverages such as sake, beer, and whiskey. It applies to beverages with an alcohol content of 1 degree or more, and the amount of tax is determined in detail according to the type of alcohol and alcohol content of the alcoholic beverage. The tax is paid by the manufacturer or importer, but since it is included in the price, it is actually the consumer who pays the tax.

==Tobacco tax==
In Japan, the price of cigarettes includes four types of taxes: national tobacco tax, local tobacco tax, special tobacco tax, and consumption tax.
Although it varies by brand and other factors, for example, the tax burden on a typical paper cigarette can reach as high as 60%, making cigarettes one of the most heavily taxed products in Japan.

<doc id="186406" wikidata="Q1123218" url="?curid=186406" title="Youngest Toba eruption">
<text>The Toba eruption (also called the Toba supereruption and the Youngest Toba eruption) was a supervolcanic eruption that occurred around 74,000 years ago, during the Late Pleistocene, at the site of present-day Lake Toba, in Sumatra, Indonesia. It was the last in a series of at least four caldera-forming eruptions there, the earlier known caldera having formed about 1.2 million years ago. This, the last eruption, had an estimated volcanic explosivity index of 8, making it the largest known explosive volcanic eruption in the Quaternary, and one of the largest known explosive eruptions in the Earth&#x27;s history.

==Eruption==
===Chronology of the Toba eruption===

The exact date of the eruption is unknown, but the pattern of ash deposits suggests that it occurred during the northern summer because only the summer monsoon could have deposited Toba ashfall in the South China Sea. The eruption lasted perhaps 9 to 14 days. The most recent two high-precision argon–argon datings dated the eruption to 73,880 ± 320 and 73,700 ± 300 years ago. Five distinct magma bodies were activated within a few centuries before the eruption. The eruption commenced with small and limited air-fall and was directly followed by the main phase of ignimbrite flows. The ignimbrite phase is characterized by low eruption fountain, but co-ignimbrite column developed on top of pyroclastic flows reached a height of . Petrological constraints on sulfur emission yielded a wide range from to , depending on the existence of separate sulfur gas in the Toba magma chamber. The lower end of estimate is due to the low solubility of sulfur in the magma. Ice core records estimate the sulfur emission on the order of .

===Effects of the eruption===

Bill Rose and Craig Chesner of Michigan Technological University have estimated that the total amount of material released in the eruption was at least —about of ignimbrite that flowed over the ground, and approximately that fell as ash mostly to the west. However, as more outcrops become available, the most recent estimate of eruptive volume is dense-rock equivalent (DRE), of which was deposited as ash fall and as ignimbrite, making this eruption the largest during the Quaternary period. Previous volume estimates have ranged from to . Inside the caldera, the maximum thickness of pyroclastic flows is over . The outflow sheet originally covered an area of with thickness nearly , likely reaching into the Indian Ocean and the Straits of Malacca. The air-fall of this eruption blanketed the Indian subcontinent in a layer of ash, the Arabian Sea in , the South China Sea in , and Central Indian Ocean Basin in . Its horizon of ashfall covered an area of more than in or more thickness (~7.5% of the Earth&#x27;s surface). In Sub-Saharan Africa, microscopic glass shards from this eruption are also discovered on the south coast of South Africa, in the lowlands of northwest Ethiopia, in Lake Malawi, and in Lake Chala. In South China, Toba tephras is found in Huguangyan Maar Lake.

The subsequent collapse formed a caldera that filled with water, creating Lake Toba. The island in the center of the lake is formed by a resurgent dome.

=== Climatic effects ===

==== Climate at the time of the eruption ====
Greenland stadial 20 (GS20) is a millennium-long cold event in the north Atlantic ocean that started around the time of Toba eruption. The timing of the initiation of GS20 is dated to 74.0–74.2 kyr, and the entire event lasted about 1,500 years. It is the stadial part of Dansgaard–Oeschger event 20 (DO20), commonly explained by an abrupt reduction in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Weaker AMOC caused warming in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica, and this asynchrony is known as bipolar seesaw. The start of the GS20 cooling event corresponds to the start of the Antarctic Isotope Maxima 19 (AIM19) warming event. GS20 was associated with iceberg discharges into the North Atlantic, thus it was also named Heinrich stadial 7a. Heinrich events tend to be longer, colder and with weaker AMOC in the Atlantic ocean than other DO stadials.
From 74 to 58 kyr, Earth transitioned from interglacial marine isotope stage (MIS) 5 to glacial MIS 4, experiencing cooling and glacial expansion. This transition is a part of the Pleistocene interglacial-glacial cycle driven by variations in the Earth&#x27;s orbit. Ocean temperatures cooled by . Sea level fell . Northern Hemisphere ice sheets embarked on significant expansion and surpassed the extent of the Last Glacial Maximum in eastern Europe, Northeast Asia and the North American Cordillera. Southern Hemisphere glaciation grew to its maximum extent during MIS 4. Australasia, Africa and Europe were characterized by increasingly cold and arid environments.

==== Possible climate records of the eruption ====
While the Toba eruption occurred in the backdrop of the rapid climate transitions of GS20 and MIS 4, triggered by changes in ocean currents and insolation, whether the eruption played any role in accelerating these events is much more debated. South China Sea marine records of climate, sampled at every centennial interval, shows cooling above the Toba ash layer for a thousand years but the authors concede that it may just be GS20. Arabian Sea marine records confirm that Toba ash occurred after the onset of GS20 but also that GS20 is not colder than GS21 in the records, from which authors conclude that the eruption did not intensify GS20 cooling. Dense sampling of environmental records, at every 6–9 year interval, in Lake Malawi, show no cooling-induced change in lake ecology and in grassy woodlands after the deposition of Toba ash, but cooling-forced aridity killed high elevation afromontane forests. The Lake Malawi studies concluded that the environmental effects of the eruption were mild and limited to less than a decade in East Africa, but these studies are questioned due to sediment mixing which would have diminished the cooling signal. Environmental records from a Middle Stone Age site in Ethiopia, however, shows that a severe drought occurred concurrently with the Toba ash layer, which altered early human foraging behaviours.

Toba ash records have not been identified in ice core samples. However, four sulfate events in the ice strata are proposed to represent the deposition of aerosols from the Toba eruption. One sulfate event at 73.75–74.16 kyr, which has all the characteristics of the Toba eruption, is among the largest sulfate loadings that have ever been identified. In the ice core records, GS20 cooling was already underway by the time of sulfate deposition; however, a 110-year period of accelerated cooling followed this sulfate event. The authors interpret this acceleration as AMOC weakened by the Toba eruption.

==== Climate modeling ====
The modeled climate effects of the Toba eruption hinges on the mass of sulfurous gases and aerosol microphysical processes. Modeling on an emission of of sulfur, which is 100 times the 1991 Pinatubo sulphur, volcanic winter has a maximum global mean cooling of and returns gradually within the range of natural variability 5 years after the eruption. An initiation of a 1,000-year cold period or ice age is not supported by the model. Two other emission scenarios, and , were investigated using state-of-art simulations provided by the Community Earth System Model. Maximum global mean cooling was for the lower emission and for the higher emission scenarios. A strong decrease in precipitation occurs in the high emission scenario. Negative temperature anomalies return to less than within 3 and 6 years for each emission scenario after the eruption. But so far no model can simulate aerosol microphysical processes with sufficient accuracy, empirical constraints from historical eruptions suggest that aerosol size may substantially reduce the magnitude of cooling to less than , no matter how much sulfur is emitted.

== Toba catastrophe theory ==
The Toba catastrophe theory holds that the eruption caused a severe global volcanic winter of six to ten years and contributed to a 1,000-year-long cooling episode, resulting in a genetic bottleneck in humans. However, some physical evidence disputes the association with the millennium-long cold event and genetic bottleneck, and some consider the theory disproven.
=== History ===
In 1972, an analysis of human hemoglobins found very few variants, and to account for the low frequency of variation human population must have been as low as a few thousand until very recently. More genetic studies confirmed an effective population on the order of 10,000 for much of human history. Subsequent research on the differences in human mitochondrial DNA sequences dated a rapid growth from a small effective population size of 1,000 to 10,000, sometime between 35 and 65 kyr ago.

In 1993, science journalist Ann Gibbons posited that population growth was suppressed by the cold climate of the last Pleistocene Ice Age, possibly exacerbated by the Toba super-eruption which at the time was dated to between 73 and 75 kyr near the beginning of glacial period MIS 4. The subsequent explosive human expansion was believed to be the result of the end of the ice age. Geologist Michael R. Rampino of New York University and volcanologist Stephen Self of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa supported her theory. In 1998, anthropologist Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign hypothesized that the Toba eruption caused a human population crash to only a few thousand surviving individuals, and the subsequent recovery was suppressed by the global glacial condition of MIS 4 until the climate eventually transitioned to the warmer condition of MIS 3 about 60,000 years ago, during which rapid human population expansion occurred.

===Possible effects on &quot;Homo&quot;===
At least two other &quot;Homo&quot; lineages, &quot;H. neanderthalensis&quot; and Denisovans, survived the Toba eruption and subsequent MIS 4 ice age, as their latest presence is dated to ca. 40 kyr, and ca. 55 kyr. Other lineages, including &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;, &quot;H. luzonensis&quot;, and Penghu 1, may have also survived through the eruption. More recently, reconstructions of human demographic history using whole-genome sequencing and discoveries of archaeological cultures within the Toba ash layer add further light to how humans had fared during the eruption and the following GS20 and MIS 4 ice age.

==== Human demographic history ====
Recent analyses apply Markov models to the complete set of genetic material to infer human population history. In non-African populations, studies recover a long-term steep decline in numbers starting 200 kyr and reaching the lowest point around 40–60 kyr. During this bottleneck non-African populations experienced 5- to 15-fold reduction, with only 1,000–3,000 remaining individuals at 50 kyr, consistent with the earliest mtDNA studies. This severe non-African contraction is consistent with a founder effect caused by Out-of-Africa dispersal. As a small group with a size of a few thousand people migrated from the African continent into the Near East, the drastic reduction in numbers imprinted on non-African genomic diversity. Genetic analysis identified 56 selective sweeps related to cold adaptations in non-African populations, of which 31 sweeps occurred during 72–97 kyr. This event of closely timed selections is named the &quot;Arabian Standstill&quot; and may have been caused by the severe cold arid conditions from the onset of MIS 4 and exacerbated by the Toba super-eruption.

African populations experienced a slightly earlier, milder bottleneck and recovered earlier. The Luhya and Maasai people attained their lowest numbers around 70–80 kyr, while the Yoruba people reached a nadir around 50 kyr, though the long-term declining trend already started before 200 kyr. The estimated remaining effective population sizes are around 10,000 individuals, larger than the estimated non-African size during their bottleneck. Unlike the non-African populations, there is no consensus as to the cause of the African bottleneck. Proposed causes include climatic deterioration (from MIS 5, Toba eruption, GS20 and/or MIS 4), reduction in substructure across African populations, and founder effects from the dispersal within Africa.

Earlier genetic analysis of Alu sequences across the entire human genome has shown that the effective human population size was less than 26,000 at 1.2 million years ago; possible explanations for the low population size of human ancestors may include repeated population crashes or periodic replacement events from competing &quot;Homo&quot; subspecies. Whole-genome analysis similarly recovers very low African population sizes around 1 million years ago. This 1 million year old bottleneck is thought to have been caused by severe ice age MIS 22 which marked the mid-Pleistocene climate transition with widespread aridity across Africa.

==== Archaeological studies ====
Other research has cast doubt on an association between the Toba Caldera Complex and a genetic bottleneck. For example, ancient stone tools at the Jurreru Valley in southern India (Andhra Pradesh) were found above and below a thick layer of ash from the Toba eruption and were very similar across these layers, suggesting that the dust clouds from the eruption did not wipe out this local population. However, another site in India, the Middle Son Valley (in Madhya Pradesh), exhibits evidence of a major population decline and it has been suggested that the abundant springs of the Jurreru Valley may have offered its inhabitants unique protection. At the Jurreru Valley in southern India, Middle Paleolithic stone tools below the Toba ash layer are dated by OSL to , while the age of stone tools above the ash layer is constrained to be no older than 55 kyr. This age gap is suspected to be due to the removal of post-eruption sediments or decimation of the local population until re-occupation at 55 kyr. Additional archaeological evidence from southern and northern India also suggests a lack of evidence for effects of the eruption on local populations, causing the authors of the study to conclude, &quot;many forms of life survived the supereruption, contrary to other research which has suggested significant animal extinctions and genetic bottlenecks&quot;. However, some researchers have questioned the techniques utilized to date artifacts to the period subsequent to the Toba supervolcano. The Toba Catastrophe also coincides with the disappearance of the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins. Evidence from pollen analysis has suggested prolonged deforestation in South Asia, and some researchers have suggested that the Toba eruption may have forced humans to adopt new adaptive strategies, which may have permitted them to replace Neanderthals and &quot;other archaic human species&quot;.

=== Genetic bottlenecks in other mammals ===
Some evidence indicates population crashes of other animals after the Toba eruption. The populations of the Eastern African chimpanzee, Bornean orangutan, central Indian macaque, cheetah and tiger, all expanded from very small populations around 70,000–55,000 years ago.

<text>A population bottleneck or genetic bottleneck is a sharp reduction in the size of a population due to environmental events such as famines, earthquakes, floods, fires, disease, and droughts; or human activities such as genocide, speciocide, widespread violence or intentional culling. Such events can reduce the variation in the gene pool of a population; thereafter, a smaller population, with a smaller genetic diversity, remains to pass on genes to future generations of offspring. Genetic diversity remains lower, increasing only when gene flow from another population occurs or very slowly increasing with time as random mutations occur. This results in a reduction in the robustness of the population and in its ability to adapt to and survive selecting environmental changes, such as climate change or a shift in available resources. Alternatively, if survivors of the bottleneck are the individuals with the greatest genetic fitness, the frequency of the fitter genes within the gene pool is increased, while the pool itself is reduced.

The genetic drift caused by a population bottleneck can change the proportional random distribution of alleles and even lead to loss of alleles. The chances of inbreeding and genetic homogeneity can increase, possibly leading to inbreeding depression. Smaller population size can also cause deleterious mutations to accumulate.

Population bottlenecks play an important role in conservation biology (see minimum viable population size) and in the context of agriculture (biological and pest control).

==Minimum viable population size==

In conservation biology, minimum viable population (MVP) size helps to determine the effective population size when a population is at risk for extinction. The effects of a population bottleneck often depend on the number of individuals remaining after the bottleneck and how that compares to the minimum viable population size.

== Founder effects ==

A slightly different form of bottleneck can occur if a small group becomes reproductively (e.g., geographically) separated from the main population, such as through a founder event, e.g., if a few members of a species successfully colonize a new isolated island, or from small captive breeding programs such as animals at a zoo. Alternatively, invasive species can undergo population bottlenecks through founder events when introduced into their invaded range.

==Examples==

===Humans===

According to a 1999 model, a severe population bottleneck, or more specifically a full-fledged speciation, occurred among a group of Australopithecina as they transitioned into the species known as &quot;Homo erectus&quot; two million years ago. It is believed that additional bottlenecks must have occurred since &quot;Homo erectus&quot; started walking the Earth, but current archaeological, paleontological, and genetic data are inadequate to give much reliable information about such conjectured bottlenecks. Nonetheless, a 2023 genetic analysis discerned such a human ancestor population bottleneck of a possible 100,000 to 1000 individuals &quot;around 930,000 and 813,000 years ago [which] lasted for about 117,000 years and brought human ancestors close to extinction.&quot; 

A 2005 study from Rutgers University theorized that the pre-1492 native populations of the Americas are the descendants of only 70 individuals who crossed the land bridge between Asia and North America.

The &quot;Neolithic Y-chromosome bottleneck&quot; refers to a period around 5000 BC where the diversity in the male y-chromosome dropped precipitously, to a level equivalent to reproduction occurring with a ratio between men and women of 1:17. Discovered in 2015, the research suggests that the reason for the bottleneck was not a reduction in the number of males, but a drastic decrease in the percentage of males with reproductive success.

====Toba catastrophe theory====

The controversial Toba catastrophe theory, presented in the late 1990s to early 2000s, suggested that a bottleneck of the human population occurred approximately 75,000 years ago, proposing that the human population was reduced to perhaps 10,000–30,000 individuals when the Toba supervolcano in Indonesia erupted and triggered a major environmental change. Parallel bottlenecks were proposed to exist among chimpanzees, gorillas, rhesus macaques, orangutans and tigers. The hypothesis was based on geological evidence of sudden climate change and on coalescence evidence of some genes (including mitochondrial DNA, Y-chromosome DNA and some nuclear genes) and the relatively low level of genetic variation in humans.

However, subsequent research, especially in the 2010s, appeared to refute both the climate argument and the genetic argument. Recent research shows the extent of climate change was much smaller than believed by proponents of the theory. 

In 2000, a &quot;Molecular Biology and Evolution&quot; paper suggested a transplanting model or a &#x27;long bottleneck&#x27; to account for the limited genetic variation, rather than a catastrophic environmental change. This would be consistent with suggestions that in sub-Saharan Africa numbers could have dropped at times as low as 2,000, for perhaps as long as 100,000 years, before numbers began to expand again in the Late Stone Age.
===Other animals===
European bison, also called wisent &quot;(Bison bonasus),&quot; faced extinction in the early 20th century. The animals living today are all descended from 12 individuals and they have extremely low genetic variation, which may be beginning to affect the reproductive ability of bulls.

The population of American bison &quot;(Bison bison)&quot; fell due to overhunting, nearly leading to extinction around the year 1890, though it has since begun to recover (see table).

A classic example of a population bottleneck is that of the northern elephant seal, whose population fell to about 30 in the 1890s. Although it now numbers in the hundreds of thousands, the potential for bottlenecks within colonies remains. Dominant bulls are able to mate with the largest number of females—sometimes as many as 100. With so much of a colony&#x27;s offspring descended from just one dominant male, genetic diversity is limited, making the species more vulnerable to diseases and genetic mutations. 

The golden hamster is a similarly bottlenecked species, with the vast majority of domesticated hamsters descended from a single litter found in the Syrian desert around 1930, and very few wild golden hamsters remain.

An extreme example of a population bottleneck is the New Zealand black robin, of which every specimen today is a descendant of a single female, called Old Blue. The Black Robin population is still recovering from its low point of only five individuals in 1980.

The genome of the giant panda shows evidence of a severe bottleneck about 43,000 years ago. There is also evidence of at least one primate species, the golden snub-nosed monkey, that also suffered from a bottleneck around this time. An unknown environmental event is suspected to have caused the bottlenecks observed in both of these species. The bottlenecks likely caused the low genetic diversity observed in both species.

Other facts can sometimes be inferred from an observed population bottleneck. Among the Galápagos Islands giant tortoises—themselves a prime example of a bottleneck—the comparatively large population on the slopes of the Alcedo volcano is significantly less diverse than four other tortoise populations on the same island. DNA analyses date the bottleneck to around 88,000 years before present (YBP). About 100,000 YBP the volcano erupted violently, deeply burying much of the tortoise habitat in pumice and ash.

Another example can be seen in the greater prairie chickens, which were prevalent in North America until the 20th century. In Illinois alone, the number of greater prairie chickens plummeted from over 100 million in 1900 to about 46 in 1998. These declines in population were the result of hunting and habitat destruction, but the random consequences have also caused a great loss in species diversity. DNA analysis comparing the birds from 1990 and mid-century shows a steep genetic decline in recent decades. Management of the greater prairie chickens now includes genetic rescue efforts including the translocation prairie chickens between leks to increase each populations genetic diversity. 

Population bottlenecking poses a major threat to the stability of species populations as well. &quot;Papilio homerus&quot; is the largest butterfly in the Americas and is endangered according to the IUCN. The disappearance of a central population poses a major threat of population bottleneck. The remaining two populations are now geographically isolated and the populations face an unstable future with limited remaining opportunity for gene flow.

Genetic bottlenecks exist in cheetahs.

=== Selective breeding ===
Bottlenecks also exist among pure-bred animals (e.g., dogs and cats: pugs, Persian) because breeders limit their gene pools to a few (show-winning) individuals for their looks and behaviors. The extensive use of desirable individual animals at the exclusion of others can result in a popular sire effect.

Selective breeding for dog breeds caused constricting breed-specific bottlenecks. These bottlenecks have led to dogs having an average of 2–3% more genetic loading than gray wolves. The strict breeding programs and population bottlenecks have led to the prevalence of diseases such as heart disease, blindness, cancers, hip dysplasia, and cataracts.

Selective breeding to produce high-yielding crops has caused genetic bottlenecks in these crops and has led to genetic homogeneity. This reduced genetic diversity in many crops could lead to broader susceptibility to new diseases or pests, which threatens global food security.

===Plants===
Research showed that there is incredibly low, nearly undetectable amounts of genetic diversity in the genome of the Wollemi pine (&quot;Wollemia nobilis&quot;). The IUCN found a population count of 80 mature individuals and about 300 seedlings and juveniles in 2011, and previously, the Wollemi pine had fewer than 50 individuals in the wild. The low population size and low genetic diversity indicates that the Wollemi pine went through a severe population bottleneck.

A population bottleneck was created in the 1970s through the conservation efforts of the endangered Mauna Kea silversword (&quot;Argyroxiphium sandwicense&quot; ssp. &quot;sandwicense&quot;). The small natural population of silversword was augmented through the 1970s with outplanted individuals. All of the outplanted silversword plants were found to be first or subsequent generation offspring of just two maternal founders. The low amount of polymorphic loci in the outplanted individuals led to the population bottleneck, causing the loss of the marker allele at eight of the loci.

<doc id="186411" wikidata="Q8060070" url="?curid=186411" title="Yuanfen">
<text>Yuán () or Yuanfen (), &quot;fateful coincidence,&quot; is a concept in Chinese society describing good and bad chances and potential relationships. It can also be translated as &quot;destiny, luck as conditioned by one&#x27;s past&quot;, or &quot;natural affinity among friends.&quot; It is comparable to the concept of &quot;karma&quot; in Buddhism, but &quot;yuanfen&quot; is interactive rather than individual. The driving forces and causes behind &quot;yuánfèn&quot; are said to be actions done in previous incarnations.

Scholars Yang Kuo-shu and David Ho have analysed the psychological advantages of this belief: by assigning causality of negative events to &quot;yuanfen&quot; beyond personal control, people tend to maintain good relationships, avoid conflict, and promote social harmony; likewise, when positive events are seen as a result of &quot;yuanfen&quot;, personal credit is not directly assigned, which reduces pride on one side of the relationship and envy and resentment on the other.

==Role in society==
Yang Kuo-shu and David Ho trace the origins of the term to traditional Buddhism and observe that &quot;yuan &quot;or &quot;yuanfen&quot; are important concepts. Yang and Ho&#x27;s research found that these concepts are still very much alive in Chinese social life and culture among university students. The concepts of &quot;yuan &quot;and &quot;yuanfen &quot;and beliefs in predestination and fatalism have waned, and belief in yuan has waned as well, but continuity with past conceptions is still strong.

Marc Moscowitz, an anthropologist, finds that &quot;yuanfen&quot; appears frequently in contemporary popular music. Here &quot;yuanfen&quot; refers to a &quot;karmic relationship&quot; with someone who was known in a previous life and is used to explain the end of a relationship that was not destined to work out.

==Popular usage==

* The proverbial saying &quot;have fate without destiny&quot; (有緣無分) refers to couples who were fated to &quot;come&quot; together, but not destined to &quot;stay&quot; together, and as such is sometimes used as a break-up line.
* Upon meeting a person who is hard to find, one might aptly exclaim: &quot;It is &quot;yuánfèn&quot; that has brought us together!&quot;
* When one encounters another repeatedly in various locations such that it seems to be more than coincidence, one can refer to &quot;yuánfèn&quot;.
* As a counter-example, when two people know each other, e.g. as penpals, but never have the opportunity to meet face-to-face, it can be said that their &quot;yuánfèn&quot; is too superficial or thin (). Literally: It takes hundreds of rebirths to bring two persons to ride in the same boat; it takes a thousand eons to bring two persons to share the same pillow. This goes to show just how precious &quot;yuánfèn&quot; is.
* An alternative of this proverb is: (pinyin: shí nián xiū dé tóng chuán dù, bǎi nián xiū dé gòng zhěn mián), which means literally: ten years of meditation (or good deeds) bring two people to cross a river in the same ferry, and a hundred years of meditation (or good deeds) bring two people to rest their heads on the same pillow. It conveys the same message.
* It is important to note that although &quot;yuanfen &quot;is often used in the context of lovers&#x27; relationships, the concept itself is much broader and can refer to any relationship between people under any circumstance. For example, &quot;yuanfen &quot;can be thought of as the mechanism by which family members have been &quot;placed&quot; in each other&#x27;s lives. On the other hand, even two strangers sitting next to each other on a short-haul plane ride are also thought to have a certain amount of &quot;yuanfen&quot;. The line of reasoning follows roughly as such: out of the seven billion or so people living on this planet, the odds of two specific persons riding in an airplane together are astronomically small. Thus, two specific persons riding together on a plane have beaten out all odds to end up in those specific seats. If, in addition to their chance encounter, they happen to strike up an engaging conversation and find that they have common interests—perhaps in cinema, music, and/or photography—it makes their meeting all the more precious, and the depth of their yuanfen all the more noteworthy.

==Translations==

&quot;Affinity occasion&quot; could be a good translation of &quot;yuánfèn&quot;, as &quot;yuánfèn&quot; depends on the probability, or chance, of meeting (or seeing) someone in the real world at any given time and place, and involves both persons feeling as if they have already known each other for a very long time, even though in reality, they have not.

The concept of &quot;serendipity&quot; is a good English approximation of &quot;yuanfen&quot; in general situations not involving any elements of a romantic relationship. The French writer Émile Deschamps claims in his memoirs that in 1805, he was treated to some plum pudding by a stranger named Monsieur de Fontgibu. Ten years later, the writer encountered plum pudding on the menu of a Paris restaurant and wanted to order some, but the waiter told him that the last dish had already been served to another customer, who turned out to be de Fontgibu. Many years later, in 1832, Deschamps was at a dinner and once again ordered plum pudding. He recalled the earlier incident and told his friends that only de Fontgibu was missing to make the setting complete—and in the same instant, the now senile de Fontgibu entered the room.

Often &quot;yuánfèn&quot; is said to be the equivalent of &quot;fate&quot; (as in the title of a 1984 film, 緣分, given the Western name &quot;Behind the Yellow Line&quot;, also known as &quot;Fate&quot;, starring Leslie Cheung), or &quot;destiny&quot;. &quot;Fateful affinity&quot; is the term used to describe &quot;yuánfèn&quot; by a leading character in Hao Jingfang&#x27;s novel &quot;Jumpnauts&quot; in Ken Liu&#x27;s 2024 translation. However, these words do not have the element of the past playing a role in deciding the outcome of the uncertain future. The most common Chinese term for &quot;fate&quot; or &quot;destiny&quot; is &quot;mìngyùn&quot; (; , literally &quot;the turn of events in life&quot;).

&quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;predestination&quot; are not exact translations, because these words imply that things happen by the will of God or gods, whereas &quot;yuánfèn&quot; does not necessarily involve divine intervention.

===Mitsogho People===
The Mitsoghos are the people of the Massifs de Chaillu mountains in the Ngounié province of Gabon. Tsogho is their language, hence the name Mi-Tsoghos (where the prefix &quot;Mi&quot; means plural). They are a relatively small ethnic group who are revered and feared for their abilities in conjuring spirits from the afterworld.

They may represent the first non-Baka Gabonese of the entire area. This knowledge can be extrapolated from the widespread usage of Mitsogho words and customs, especially pertaining to the animistic religious practices of all Gabonese ethnic groups. For example, Bwiti, the dominant religious doctrine of the country is a Mitshogo name and the Bwiti is based on the magic powers of &quot;the sacred wood&quot; or ibogha (small shrub - Tabernanthe iboga) which is also a Mitsogho word meaning healing-ibo and wood-gha.

Nearly all healing ceremonies in Gabonese traditional culture involve the singing of Mitsogho songs. In fact, Mitsogho words are so well known throughout the entire country that at one point the government was considering making Mitsogho the national ethnic language.

The majority of modern Mitsoghos live in Libreville and Mouila; however, their roots can be traced back north–south into the tropical mountain forests just west of where the Ngounié river meets the Ogoué river to where the Ogoulou river meets the Ngounié river. The most prominent old village sites were located near the 70 mile-long Ikobé valley.

This small but fierce group of people were the last ethnic group to be defeated by the French colonists (around 1940). In long-lived Mitsogho lore, a warrior by the name of Mbombet A Gnaghé hid out in the Ikobé valley to stage guerrilla attacks against the French military. Mbombet supposedly had magical powers, but was finally betrayed by a woman.

The modern day offspring who can be traced directly back to Mbombet still hold special positions within the traditional Mitsogho tribal authority. They are usually celebrated magicians and healers.

<doc id="186415" wikidata="Q152869" url="?curid=186415" title="Mojibake">
<text>Mojibake (; , &#x27;character transformation&#x27;) is the garbled or gibberish text that is the result of text being decoded using an unintended character encoding. The result is a systematic replacement of symbols with completely unrelated ones, often from a different writing system.

This display may include the generic replacement character in places where the binary representation is considered invalid. A replacement can also involve multiple consecutive symbols, as viewed in one encoding, when the same binary code constitutes one symbol in the other encoding. This is either because of differing constant length encoding (as in Asian 16-bit encodings vs European 8-bit encodings), or the use of variable length encodings (notably UTF-8 and UTF-16).

Failed rendering of glyphs due to either missing fonts or missing glyphs in a font is a different issue that is not to be confused with mojibake. Symptoms of this failed rendering include blocks with the code point displayed in hexadecimal or using the generic replacement character. Importantly, these replacements are &quot;valid&quot; and are the result of correct error handling by the software.

==Causes==
To correctly reproduce the original text that was encoded, the correspondence between the encoded data and the notion of its encoding must be preserved (i.e. the source and target encoding standards must be the same). As mojibake is the instance of non-compliance between these, it can be achieved by manipulating the data itself, or just relabelling it.

Mojibake is often seen with text data that have been tagged with a wrong encoding; it may not even be tagged at all, but moved between computers with different default encodings. A major source of trouble are communication protocols that rely on settings on each computer rather than sending or storing metadata together with the data.

The differing default settings between computers are in part due to differing deployments of Unicode among operating system families, and partly the legacy encodings&#x27; specializations for different writing systems of human languages. Whereas Linux distributions mostly switched to UTF-8 in 2004, Microsoft Windows generally uses UTF-16, and sometimes uses 8-bit code pages for text files in different languages.

For some writing systems, such as Japanese, several encodings have historically been employed, causing users to see mojibake relatively often. As an example, the word &quot;mojibake&quot; itself (&quot;文字化け&quot;) stored as EUC-JP might be incorrectly displayed as , &quot;ﾊｸｻ嵂ｽ､ｱ&quot; (MS-932), or &quot;ﾊｸｻ郾ｽ､ｱ&quot; if interpreted as Shift-JIS, or as &quot;Ê¸»ú²½¤±&quot; in software that assumes text to be in the Windows-1252 or ISO 8859-1 encodings, usually labelled &quot;Western&quot; or &quot;Western European&quot;. This is further exacerbated if other locales are involved: the same text stored as UTF-8 appears as if interpreted as Shift-JIS, as &quot;æ–‡å­—åŒ–ã‘&quot; if interpreted as Western, or (for example) as &quot;鏂囧瓧鍖栥亼&quot; if interpreted as being in a GBK (Mainland China) locale.

===Underspecification===
If the encoding is not specified, it is up to the software to decide it by other means. Depending on the type of software, the typical solution is either configuration or charset detection heuristics, both of which are prone to mis-prediction.

The encoding of text files is affected by locale setting, which depends on the user&#x27;s language and brand of operating system, among other conditions. Therefore, the assumed encoding is systematically wrong for files that come from a computer with a different setting, or even from a differently localized piece of software within the same system. For Unicode, one solution is to use a byte order mark, but many parsers do not tolerate this for source code or other machine-readable text. Another solution is to store the encoding as metadata in the file system; file systems that support extended file attributes can store this as codice_1. This also requires support in software that wants to take advantage of it, but does not disturb other software.

While some encodings are easy to detect, such as UTF-8, there are many that are hard to distinguish (see charset detection). For example, a web browser may not be able to distinguish between a page coded in EUC-JP and another in Shift-JIS if the encoding is not assigned explicitly using HTTP headers sent along with the documents, or using the document&#x27;s meta tags that are used to substitute for missing HTTP headers if the server cannot be configured to send the proper HTTP headers; see character encodings in HTML.

===Mis-specification===
Mojibake also occurs when the encoding is incorrectly specified. This often happens between encodings that are similar. For example, the Eudora email client for Windows was known to send emails labelled as ISO 8859-1 that were in reality Windows-1252. Windows-1252 contains extra printable characters in the C1 range (the most frequently seen being curved quotation marks and extra dashes), that were not displayed properly in software complying with the ISO standard; this especially affected software running under other operating systems such as Unix.

====User oversight====
Of the encodings still in common use, many originated from taking ASCII and appending atop it; as a result, these encodings are partially compatible with each other. Examples of this include Windows-1252 and ISO 8859-1. People thus may mistake the expanded encoding set they are using with plain ASCII.

===Overspecification===
When there are layers of protocols, each trying to specify the encoding based on different information, the least certain information may be misleading to the recipient.
For example, consider a web server serving a static HTML file over HTTP. The character set may be communicated to the client in any number of 3 ways:
* in the HTTP header. This information can be based on server configuration (for instance, when serving a file off disk) or controlled by the application running on the server (for dynamic websites).
* in the file, as an HTML meta tag (codice_2 or codice_3) or the codice_4 attribute of an XML declaration. This is the encoding that the author meant to save the particular file in.
* in the file, as a byte order mark. This is the encoding that the author&#x27;s editor actually saved it in. Unless an accidental encoding conversion has happened (by opening it in one encoding and saving it in another), this will be correct. It is, however, only available in Unicode encodings such as UTF-8 or UTF-16.

===Lack of hardware or software support===
Much older hardware is typically designed to support only one character set and the character set typically cannot be altered. The character table contained within the display firmware will be localized to have characters for the country the device is to be sold in, and typically the table differs from country to country. As such, these systems will potentially display mojibake when loading text generated on a system from a different country. Likewise, many early operating systems do not support multiple encoding formats and thus will end up displaying mojibake if made to display non-standard text early versions of Microsoft Windows and Palm OS for example, are localized on a per-country basis and will only support encoding standards relevant to the country the localized version will be sold in, and thus will display mojibake if a file containing a text in a different encoding format from the version that the OS is designed to support is opened.

==Resolutions==
Applications using UTF-8 as a default encoding may achieve a greater degree of interoperability because of its widespread use and backward compatibility with US-ASCII. UTF-8 also has the ability to be directly recognised by a simple algorithm, so that well written software should be able to avoid mixing UTF-8 up with other encodings.

The difficulty of resolving an instance of mojibake varies depending on the application within which it occurs and the causes of it. Two of the most common applications in which mojibake may occur are web browsers and word processors. Modern browsers and word processors often support a wide array of character encodings. Browsers often allow a user to change their rendering engine&#x27;s encoding setting on the fly, while word processors allow the user to select the appropriate encoding when opening a file. It may take some trial and error for users to find the correct encoding.

The problem gets more complicated when it occurs in an application that normally does not support a wide range of character encoding, such as in a non-Unicode computer game. In this case, the user must change the operating system&#x27;s encoding settings to match that of the game. However, changing the system-wide encoding settings can also cause Mojibake in pre-existing applications. In Windows XP or later, a user also has the option to use Microsoft AppLocale, an application that allows the changing of per-application locale settings. Even so, changing the operating system encoding settings is not possible on earlier operating systems such as Windows 98; to resolve this issue on earlier operating systems, a user would have to use third party font rendering applications.

==Problems in different writing systems==
===English===
Mojibake in English texts generally occurs in punctuation, such as em dashes (—), en dashes (–), and curly quotes (“, ”, ‘, ’), but rarely in character text, since most encodings agree with ASCII on the encoding of the English alphabet. For example, the pound sign codice_5 will appear as codice_6 if it was encoded by the sender as UTF-8 but interpreted by the recipient as one of the Western European encodings (CP1252 or ISO 8859-1). If iterated using CP1252, this can lead to codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and so on.

Similarly, the right single quotation mark (’), when encoded in UTF-8 and decoded using Windows-1252, becomes codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, and so on.

In older eras, some computers had vendor-specific encodings which caused mismatch also for English text. Commodore brand 8-bit computers used PETSCII encoding, particularly notable for inverting the upper and lower case compared to standard ASCII. PETSCII printers worked fine on other computers of the era, but inverted the case of all letters. IBM mainframes use the EBCDIC encoding which does not match ASCII at all.

===Other Western European languages===
The alphabets of the North Germanic languages, Catalan, Romanian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish are all extensions of the Latin alphabet. The additional characters are typically the ones that become corrupted, making texts only mildly unreadable with mojibake:
*å, ä, ö in Finnish and Swedish (š and ž are present in some Finnish loanwords, é marginally in Swedish, mainly also in loanwords)
*à, ç, è, é, ï, í, ò, ó, ú, ü in Catalan
*æ, ø, å in Norwegian and Danish as well as optional acute accents on é etc for disambiguation
*á, é, ó, ĳ, è, ë, ï in Dutch
*ä, ö, ü, and ß in German
*á, ð, í, ó, ú, ý, æ, ø in Faroese
*á, ð, é, í, ó, ú, ý, þ, æ, ö in Icelandic
*à, â, ç, è, é, ë, ê, ï, î, ô, ù, û, ü, ÿ, æ, œ in French
*à, è, é, ì, ò, ù in Italian
*á, é, í, ñ, ó, ú, ü, ¡, ¿ in Spanish
*à, á, â, ã, ç, é, ê, í, ó, ô, õ, ú in Portuguese (ü no longer used)
*á, é, í, ó, ú in Irish
*à, è, ì, ò, ù in Scottish Gaelic
*ă, â, î, ș, ț in Romanian
*£ in British English (æ and œ are rarely used)
... and their uppercase counterparts, if applicable.

These are languages for which the ISO 8859-1 character set (also known as &quot;Latin 1&quot; or &quot;Western&quot;) has been in use. However, ISO 8859-1 has been obsoleted by two competing standards, the backward compatible Windows-1252, and the slightly altered ISO 8859-15. Both add the Euro sign € and the French œ, but otherwise any confusion of these three character sets does not create mojibake in these languages. Furthermore, it is always safe to interpret ISO 8859-1 as Windows-1252, and fairly safe to interpret it as ISO 8859-15, in particular with respect to the Euro sign, which replaces the rarely used currency sign (¤). However, with the advent of UTF-8, mojibake has become more common in certain scenarios, e.g. exchange of text files between UNIX and Windows computers, due to UTF-8&#x27;s incompatibility with Latin-1 and Windows-1252. But UTF-8 has the ability to be directly recognised by a simple algorithm, so that well written software should be able to avoid mixing UTF-8 up with other encodings, so this was most common when many had software not supporting UTF-8. Most of these languages were supported by MS-DOS default CP437 and other machine default encodings, except ASCII, so problems when buying an operating system version were less common. Windows and MS-DOS are not compatible, however.

In Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and German, vowels are rarely repeated, and it is usually obvious when one character gets corrupted, e.g. the second letter in the Swedish word &#x27; (&quot;love&quot;) when it is encoded in UTF-8 but decoded in Western, producing &quot;kÃ⁠¤rlek&quot;, or &quot;für&quot; in German, which becomes &quot;fÃ¼r&quot;. This way, even though the reader has to guess what the original letter is, almost all texts remain legible. Finnish, on the other hand, frequently uses repeating vowels in words like &#x27; (&quot;wedding night&quot;) which can make corrupted text very hard to read (e.g. &#x27; appears as &quot;hÃ⁠¤Ã⁠¤yÃ⁠¶&quot;). Icelandic has ten possibly confounding characters, and Faroese has eight, making many words almost completely unintelligible when corrupted (e.g. Icelandic &#x27;, &quot;outstanding hospitality&quot;, appears as &quot;Ã¾jÃ³Ã°lÃ¶Ã°&quot;).

In German, &#x27; (&quot;letter salad&quot;) is a common term for this phenomenon, in Spanish, &#x27; (literally &quot;deformation&quot;) is used, and in Portuguese, &quot;&quot; (literally &quot;deformatting&quot;) is used.

Some users transliterate their writing when using a computer, either by omitting the problematic diacritics, or by using digraph replacements (å → aa, ä/æ → ae, ö/ø → oe, ü → ue etc.). Thus, an author might write &quot;ueber&quot; instead of &quot;über&quot;, which is standard practice in German when umlauts are not available. The latter practice seems to be better tolerated in the German language sphere than in the Nordic countries. For example, in Norwegian, digraphs are associated with archaic Danish, and may be used jokingly. However, digraphs are useful in communication with other parts of the world. As an example, the Norwegian football player Ole Gunnar Solskjær had his last name spelled &quot;SOLSKJAER&quot; on his uniform when he played for Manchester United.

An artifact of UTF-8 misinterpreted as ISO 8859-1, &quot;&quot; being rendered as &quot;Ring meg nÃ¥&quot;, was seen in 2014 in an SMS scam targeting Norway.

The same problem occurs also in Romanian, see these examples:


===Central and Eastern European===
Users of Central and Eastern European languages can also be affected. Because most computers were not connected to any network during the mid- to late-1980s, there were different character encodings for every language with diacritical characters (see ISO/IEC 8859 and KOI-8), often also varying by operating system.

====Hungarian====
In Hungarian, the phenomenon is referred to as &quot;betűszemét&quot;, meaning &quot;letter garbage&quot;. Hungarian has been particularly susceptible as it contains the accented letters á, é, í, ó, ú, ö, ü (all present in the Latin-1 character set), plus the two characters ő and ű which are not in Latin-1. These two characters can be correctly encoded in Latin-2, Windows-1250, and Unicode. However, before Unicode became common in e-mail clients, e-mails containing Hungarian text often had the letters ő and ű corrupted, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It is common to respond to a corrupted e-mail with the nonsense phrase (literally &quot;Flood-resistant mirror-drilling machine&quot;) which contains all accented characters used in Hungarian.

=====Examples=====
====Polish====
Prior to the creation of ISO 8859-2 in 1987, users of various computing platforms used their own character encodings such as AmigaPL on Amiga, Atari Club on Atari ST and Masovia, IBM CP852, Mazovia and Windows CP1250 on IBM PCs. Polish companies selling early DOS computers created their own mutually-incompatible ways to encode Polish characters and simply reprogrammed the EPROMs of the video cards (typically CGA, EGA, or Hercules) to provide hardware code pages with the needed glyphs for Polish arbitrarily located with no reference whatsoever to where other computer sellers had placed them.

The situation began to improve when, after pressure from academic and user groups, ISO 8859-2 succeeded as the &quot;Internet standard&quot; with limited support of the dominant vendors&#x27; software (today largely replaced by Unicode). With the numerous problems caused by the variety of encodings, even today some users tend to refer to Polish diacritical characters as (, lit. &quot;little shrubs&quot;).

====Russian and other Cyrillic-based alphabets ====
Mojibake is colloquially called ( ) in Russian, which was and remains complicated by several systems for encoding Cyrillic. The Soviet Union and early Russian Federation developed KOI encodings (, , which translates to &quot;Code for Information Exchange&quot;). This began with Cyrillic-only 7-bit KOI7, based on ASCII but with Latin and some other characters replaced with Cyrillic letters. Then came 8-bit KOI8 encoding that is an ASCII extension which encodes Cyrillic letters only with high-bit set octets corresponding to 7-bit codes from KOI7. It is for this reason that KOI8 text, even Russian, remains partially readable after stripping the eighth bit, which was considered as a major advantage in the age of 8BITMIME-unaware email systems. For example, the words &quot;&quot; (), when encoded in KOI8 and passed through the high bit stripping process, end up being rendered as &quot;[KOLA RUSSKOGO qZYKA&quot;. Eventually, KOI8 gained different flavors for Russian and Bulgarian (KOI8-R), Ukrainian (KOI8-U), Belarusian (KOI8-RU), and even Tajik (KOI8-T).

Meanwhile, in the West, Code page 866 supported Ukrainian and Belarusian, as well as Russian and Bulgarian in MS-DOS. For Microsoft Windows, Code Page 1251 added support for Serbian and other Slavic variants of Cyrillic.

Most recently, the Unicode encoding includes code points for virtually all characters in all languages, including all Cyrillic characters.

Before Unicode, it was necessary to match text encoding with a font using the same encoding system; failure to do this produced unreadable gibberish whose specific appearance varied depending on the exact combination of text and font encoding. For example, attempting to view non-Unicode Cyrillic text using a font that is limited to the Latin alphabet, or using the default (&quot;Western&quot;) encoding, typically results in text that consists almost entirely of capitalized vowels with diacritical marks (e.g. KOI8 &quot;&quot; (, library) becomes &quot;âÉÂÌÉÏÔÅËÁ&quot;, while &quot;Школа русского языка&quot; (, Russian-language school) becomes &quot;ûËÏÌÁ ÒÕÓÓËÏÇÏ ÑÚÙËÁ&quot;). Using Code Page 1251 to view text in KOI8, or vice versa, results in garbled text that consists mostly of capital letters (KOI8 and Code Page 1251 share the same ASCII region, but KOI8 has uppercase letters in the region where Code Page 1251 has lowercase, and vice versa).

During the early years of the Russian sector of the World Wide Web, both KOI8 and Code Page 1251 were common. Nearly all websites now use Unicode, but an estimated 0.35% of all web pages worldwideall languages includedare still encoded in Code Page 1251, while less than 0.003% of sites are still encoded in KOI8-R. Though the HTML standard includes the ability to specify the encoding for any given web page in its source, this is sometimes neglected, forcing the user to switch encodings in the browser manually.

In Bulgarian, mojibake is often called (), meaning &quot;monkey&#x27;s [alphabet]&quot;. In Serbian, it is called (), meaning &quot;trash&quot;. Unlike the former USSR, South Slavs never used something like KOI8, and Code Page 1251 was the dominant Cyrillic encoding before Unicode; therefore, these languages experienced fewer encoding incompatibility troubles than Russian. In the 1980s, Bulgarian computers used their own MIK encoding, which is superficially similar to, albeit although incompatible with, CP866.

====Yugoslav languages====
Croatian, Bosnian, Serbian (the seceding varieties of Serbo-Croatian language) and Slovenian add to the basic Latin alphabet the letters š, đ, č, ć, ž, and their capital counterparts Š, Đ, Č, Ć, Ž (only č/Č, š/Š and ž/Ž are officially used in Slovenian, although others are used when needed, mostly in foreign names). All of these letters are defined in Latin-2 and Windows-1250, while only some (š, Š, ž, Ž, Đ) exist in the usual OS-default Windows-1252, and are there because of some other languages.

Although Mojibake can occur with any of these characters, the letters that are not included in Windows-1252 are much more prone to errors. Thus, even nowadays, &quot;šđčćž ŠĐČĆŽ&quot; is often displayed as &quot;šðèæž ŠÐÈÆŽ&quot;, although ð, È, and Æ are never used in Slavic languages.

When confined to basic ASCII (most user names, for example), common replacements are: š→s, đ→dj, č→c, ć→c, ž→z (capital forms analogously, with Đ→Dj or Đ→DJ depending on word case). All of these replacements introduce ambiguities, so reconstructing the original from such a form is usually done manually if required.

The Windows-1252 encoding is important because the English versions of the Windows operating system are most widespread, not localized ones. The reasons for this include a relatively small and fragmented market, increasing the price of high quality localization, a high degree of software piracy (in turn caused by high price of software compared to income), which discourages localization efforts, and people preferring English versions of Windows and other software.

The drive to differentiate Croatian from Serbian, Bosnian from Croatian and Serbian, and now even Montenegrin from the other three creates many problems. There are many different localizations, using different standards and of different quality. There are no common translations for the vast amount of computer terminology originating in English. In the end, people use English loanwords (&quot;kompjuter&quot; for &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;kompajlirati&quot; for &quot;compile,&quot; etc.), and if they are unaccustomed to the translated terms, they may not understand what some option in a menu is supposed to do based on the translated phrase. Therefore, people who understand English, as well as those who are accustomed to English terminology (who are most, because English terminology is also mostly taught in schools because of these problems) regularly choose the original English versions of non-specialist software.

When Cyrillic script is used (for Macedonian and partially Serbian), the problem is similar to other Cyrillic-based scripts.

Newer versions of English Windows allow the code page to be changed (older versions require special English versions with this support), but this setting can be and often was incorrectly set. For example, Windows 98 and Windows Me can be set to most non-right-to-left single-byte code pages including 1250, but only at install time.

===Asian encodings===
Another type of mojibake occurs when text encoded in a single-byte encoding is erroneously parsed in a multi-byte encoding, such as one of the encodings for East Asian languages. With this kind of mojibake more than one (typically two) characters are corrupted at once. For example, if the Swedish word is encoded in Windows-1252 but decoded using GBK, it will appear as &quot;k鋜lek&quot;, where &quot;&quot; is parsed as &quot;鋜&quot;. Compared to the above mojibake, this is harder to read, since letters unrelated to the problematic å, ä or ö are missing, and is especially problematic for short words starting with å, ä or ö (e.g. &quot;än&quot; becomes &quot;鋘&quot;). Since two letters are combined, the mojibake also seems more random (over 50 variants compared to the normal three, not counting the rarer capitals). In some rare cases, an entire text string which happens to include a pattern of particular word lengths, such as the sentence &quot;Bush hid the facts&quot;, may be misinterpreted.

====Vietnamese====

In Vietnamese, the phenomenon is called &quot;chữ ma&quot; (Hán–Nôm: 𡨸魔, &quot;ghost characters&quot;) or &quot;loạn mã&quot; (from Chinese 乱码, &quot;luànmǎ&quot;). It can occur when a computer tries to decode text encoded in UTF-8 as Windows-1258, TCVN3 or VNI. In Vietnam, &quot;chữ ma&quot; was commonly seen on computers that ran pre-Vista versions of Windows or cheap mobile phones.

====Japanese====

In Japan, mojibake is especially problematic as there are many different Japanese text encodings. Alongside Unicode encodings (UTF-8 and UTF-16), there are other standard encodings, such as Shift-JIS (Windows machines) and EUC-JP (UNIX systems). Even to this day, mojibake is often encountered by both Japanese and non-Japanese people when attempting to run software written for the Japanese market.

====Chinese====
In Chinese, the same phenomenon is called &quot;Luàn mǎ&quot; (Pinyin, Simplified Chinese , Traditional Chinese , meaning &#x27;chaotic code&#x27;), and can occur when computerised text is encoded in one Chinese character encoding but is displayed using the wrong encoding. When this occurs, it is often possible to fix the issue by switching the character encoding without loss of data. The situation is complicated because of the existence of several Chinese character encoding systems in use, the most common ones being: Unicode, Big5, and Guobiao (with several backward compatible versions), and the possibility of Chinese characters being encoded using Japanese encoding.

It is relatively easy to identify the original encoding when &quot;luànmǎ&quot; occurs in Guobiao encodings: 
An additional problem in Chinese occurs when rare or antiquated characters, many of which are still used in personal or place names, do not exist in some encodings. Examples of this are:

* The Big5 encoding&#x27;s lack of the &quot;煊&quot; (&quot;xuān&quot;) in the name of Taiwanese politician Wang Chien-shien (), the &quot;堃&quot; (&quot;kūn&quot;) in the name of Yu Shyi-kun (), and the &quot;喆&quot; (&quot;zhé&quot;) in the name of singer David Tao (),
* GB 2312&#x27;s lack of the &quot;镕&quot; (&quot;róng&quot;) in ex-PRC Premier Zhu Rongji (), and
* GBK&#x27;s lack of the copyright symbol &quot;©&quot;.

Newspapers have dealt with missing characters in various ways, including using image editing software to synthesize them by combining other radicals and characters; using a picture of the personalities (in the case of people&#x27;s names), or simply substituting homophones in the hope that readers would be able to make the correct inference.

====Indic text====
A similar effect can occur in Brahmic or Indic scripts of South Asia, used in such Indo-Aryan or Indic languages as Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi, and others, even if the character set employed is properly recognized by the application. This is because, in many Indic scripts, the rules by which individual letter symbols combine to create symbols for syllables may not be properly understood by a computer missing the appropriate software, even if the glyphs for the individual letter forms are available.

One example of this is the old Wikipedia logo, which attempts to show the character analogous to &quot;wi&quot; (the first syllable of &quot;Wikipedia&quot;) on each of many puzzle pieces. The puzzle piece meant to bear the Devanagari character for &quot;wi&quot; instead used to display the &quot;wa&quot; character followed by an unpaired &quot;i&quot; modifier vowel, easily recognizable as mojibake generated by a computer not configured to display Indic text. The logo as redesigned has fixed these errors.

The idea of Plain Text requires the operating system to provide a font to display Unicode codes. This font is different from OS to OS for Singhala and it makes orthographically incorrect glyphs for some letters (syllables) across all operating systems. For instance, the &#x27;reph&#x27;, the short form for &#x27;r&#x27; is a diacritic that normally goes on top of a plain letter. However, it is wrong to go on top of some letters like &#x27;ya&#x27; or &#x27;la&#x27; in specific contexts. For Sanskritic words or names inherited by modern languages, such as कार्य, IAST: &quot;kārya&quot;, or आर्या, IAST: &quot;āryā&quot;, it is apt to put it on top of these letters. By contrast, for similar sounds in modern languages which result from their specific rules, it is not put on top, such as the word करणाऱ्या, IAST: &quot;karaṇāryā&quot;, a stem form of the common word करणारा/री, IAST: &quot;karaṇārā/rī&quot;, in the Marathi language. But it happens in most operating systems. This appears to be a fault of internal programming of the fonts. In Mac OS and iOS, the muurdhaja l (dark l) and &#x27;u&#x27; combination and its long form both yield wrong shapes.

Some Indic and Indic-derived scripts, most notably Lao, were not officially supported by Windows XP until the release of Vista. However, various sites have made free-to-download fonts.

====Burmese====
Due to Western sanctions and the late arrival of Burmese language support in computers, much of the early Burmese localization was homegrown without international cooperation. The prevailing means of Burmese support is via the Zawgyi font, a font that was created as a Unicode font but was in fact only partially Unicode compliant. In the Zawgyi font, some codepoints for Burmese script were implemented as specified in Unicode, but others were not. The Unicode Consortium refers to this as &quot;ad hoc font encodings&quot;. With the advent of mobile phones, mobile vendors such as Samsung and Huawei simply replaced the Unicode compliant system fonts with Zawgyi versions.

Due to these &quot;ad hoc&quot; encodings, communications between users of Zawgyi and Unicode would render as garbled text. To get around this issue, content producers would make posts in both Zawgyi and Unicode. Myanmar government designated 1 October 2019 as &quot;U-Day&quot; to officially switch to Unicode. The full transition was estimated to take two years.

===African languages===
In certain writing systems of Africa, unencoded text is unreadable. Texts that may produce mojibake include those from the Horn of Africa such as the Ge&#x27;ez script in Ethiopia and Eritrea, used for Amharic, Tigre, and other languages, and the Somali language, which employs the Osmanya alphabet. In Southern Africa, the Mwangwego alphabet is used to write languages of Malawi and the Mandombe alphabet was created for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but these are not generally supported. Various other writing systems native to West Africa present similar problems, such as the N&#x27;Ko alphabet, used for Manding languages in Guinea, and the Vai syllabary, used in Liberia.

===Arabic===
Another affected language is Arabic (see below), in which text becomes completely unreadable when the encodings do not match.

====Examples====

The examples in this article do not have UTF-8 as browser setting, because UTF-8 is easily recognisable, so if a browser supports UTF-8 it should recognise it automatically, and not try to interpret something else as UTF-8.

* Newline – The conventions for representing the line break differ between Windows and Unix systems. Though most software supports both conventions (which is trivial), software that must preserve or display the difference (e.g. version control systems and data comparison tools) can get substantially more difficult to use if not adhering to one convention.
* Byte order mark – The most in-band way to store the encoding together with the data – prepend it. This is by intention invisible to humans using compliant software, but will by design be perceived as &quot;garbage characters&quot; to incompliant software (including many interpreters).
* HTML entities – An encoding of special characters in HTML, mostly optional, but required for certain characters to escape interpretation as markup. While failure to apply this transformation is a vulnerability (see cross-site scripting), applying it too many times results in garbling of these characters. For example, the quotation mark codice_14 becomes codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, and so on.

<doc id="186416" wikidata="Q6050779" url="?curid=186416" title="International Graphoanalysis Society">
<text>&quot;IGAS&quot; is the abbreviation for &quot;International Graphoanalysis Society&quot;. The organization is far more commonly referred to by its initials than the full name.

IGAS traces its beginnings back to 1929, when Milton N. Bunker formed &quot;The American Grapho Analysis Society&quot;. The company has seen an ownership change many times since it was founded. Around 1957, that organization was replaced by &quot;The International Graphoanalysis Society&quot;, which was run by V. Peter Ferrara. Upon V. Peter Ferrara&#x27;s death, ownership of the company fell to his daughter, Kathleen Kusta because her brother, Peter Ferrara, had recently argued with his father and thus was written out of the will. This left control of the company to Kusta. Peter Ferrara was assigned to oversee their publishing company, Nelson-Hall Publishers Both companies shared office space in Chicago. In June 2003, Kathleen Kusta sold most of the assets of IGAS by private auction to Greg Greco.

From the early seventies through the early eighties, the organization put energy into graphological research, the most important being Crumbaugh &amp; Stockholm (1977) and Stockholm (1980), (1983).

== Members ==

IGAS is a privately held corporation. As such, information about its finances, membership numbers, actual number of graduates, and related items can not be independently verified. The masthead of its publication &quot;The Journal of Graphoanalysis&quot; lists the organization&#x27;s current claimed statistical data.

IGAS has roughly 30 chapters, covering the United States, parts of Canada, the UK, and South Africa.

The highest reported membership number, which was issued to a student of Graphoanalysis was just over 50,000. There are no reliable figures on the number of students at any specific time. Both the number of dues paying members, and the number of students are believed to have peaked during the late seventies. This was just before IGASHQ started the wholesale purging of members and chapters.

== The Courses ==

&quot;Eight Basic Steps in Graphoanalysis&quot; is the beginning course that many members teach people interested in handwriting analysis.

&quot;The General Course of Graphoanalysis&quot; is the course taught by IGAS. Graduates of that course are awarded the designation &quot;Certified Graphoanalysts&quot;, more commonly referred to as &quot;CGA&quot;.

Graduates of &quot;The Advanced Course of Graphoanalysis&quot; are awarded the designation of &quot;Master Graphoanalyst&quot; or &quot;MGA&quot;.

Attendees of the annual Congress are awarded Three Year Study Certificates, or Six Year Study Certificates, upon attending the Congress the appropriate number of times.

&quot;The monthly study packet&quot; is a four-page lesson that challenges members to improve their ability to analyze handwriting. Beginning in the early-90s, the monthly study packet was incorporated into the IGAS&#x27;s monthly journal publication.

== The Dissenters ==

Because of the tight control that IGAS had on its members, the field of handwriting analysis is functionally divided into two groups—Graphoanalysts, and Graphologists.

A clause that was responsible for the expulsion of hundreds of members of IGAS between 1970 and 1990 was: &quot;Further, I will not affiliate with any group of handwriting analysts not sanctioned by the International Graphoanalysis Society, Inc.&quot;, the last clause of the 1980 Code of Ethics of IGAS.&#x27;

In 1957, Charlie Cole set up a series of graphology lectures, which evolved into &quot;The American Handwriting Analysis Foundation&quot;. The lectures were intended for graduates of the MGA program only. Klara G. Roman gave the first series of lectures. Later lectures were given by other Holistic Graphologers. As a result of that study, Charlie Cole, and most of the people that attended that lecture series, were expelled from IGAS.

&quot;Handwriting Analysts of Minnesota&quot; was another group that was started as a direct result of the entire chapter being expelled for the unethical conduct of having a Holistic Graphologer lecture at their quarterly meeting.

The list of people who were thus expelled goes on and on. The net result of this is that the majority of currently active organizations of handwriting analysts in the United States were formed due to this wall of separation that IGAS required its members to keep.

== Graphology journals ==

&quot;The Canadian Analyst&quot; published by Alex Sjoberg documented most of the history of both The American Grapho Analysis Society, and IGAS. Prior its demise, it was the longest running graphological periodical in North America. 

&quot;The Grapho Analyst&quot; was published by IGAS from 1940 to 1962. &quot;The Journal of Graphoanalysis&quot; was published by IGAS, from 1962 to 2003. Publication of the &quot;IGAS Journal&quot; has been published from 2004 to present.

<doc id="186417" wikidata="Q314471" url="?curid=186417" title="Erving Goffman">
<text>Erving Goffman (11 June 1922 – 19 November 1982) was a Canadian-born American sociologist, social psychologist, and writer, considered by some &quot;the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;The Times Higher Education Guide&quot; listed him as the sixth most-cited author of books in the humanities and social sciences.

Goffman was the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This took the form of dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&quot;. Goffman&#x27;s other major works include &quot;Asylums&quot; (1961), &quot;Stigma&quot; (1963), &quot;Interaction Ritual&quot; (1967), &quot;Frame Analysis&quot; (1974), and &quot;Forms of Talk&quot; (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) of experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.

==Life==
Goffman was born 11 June 1922, in Mannville, Alberta, Canada, to Max Goffman and Anne Goffman, née Averbach. He was from a family of Ukrainian Jews who had emigrated to Canada at the turn of the century. He had an older sister, Frances Bay, who became an actress. The family moved to Dauphin, Manitoba, where his father operated a successful tailoring business.

From 1937 Goffman attended St. John&#x27;s Technical High School in Winnipeg, where his family had moved that year. In 1939 he enrolled at the University of Manitoba, majoring in chemistry. He interrupted his studies and moved to Ottawa to work in the film industry for the National Film Board of Canada, established by John Grierson. Later he developed an interest in sociology. Also during this time, he met the renowned North American sociologist Dennis Wrong. Their meeting motivated Goffman to leave the University of Manitoba and enroll at the University of Toronto, where he studied under C. W. M. Hart and Ray Birdwhistell, graduating in 1945 with a BA in sociology and anthropology. Later he moved to the University of Chicago, where he received an MA (1949) and PhD (1953) in sociology. For his doctoral dissertation, from December 1949 to May 1951 he lived and collected ethnographic data on the island of Unst in the Shetland Islands. Goffman&#x27;s dissertation, entitled &quot;Communication Conduct in an Island Community&quot; (1953), was completed under the supervision of W. Lloyd Warner, Donald Horton, and Anselm Strauss.

In 1952 Goffman married Angelica Schuyler Choate (nicknamed Sky); in 1953, their son Thomas was born. Angelica experienced mental illness and died by suicide in 1964. Outside his academic career, Goffman was known for his interest, and relative success, in the stock market and gambling. At one point, in pursuit of his hobbies and ethnographic studies, he became a pit boss at a Las Vegas casino.

In 1981 Goffman married sociolinguist Gillian Sankoff. The following year, their daughter Alice was born. In 1982 Goffman died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 20 November, of stomach cancer. His daughter is also a sociologist.

== Career ==
The research Goffman did on Unst inspired him to write his first major work, &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&quot; (1956). After graduating from the University of Chicago, in 1954–57 he was an assistant to the athletic director at the National Institute for Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Participant observation done there led to his essays on mental illness and total institutions which came to form his second book, &quot;Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates&quot; (1961).

In 1958 Goffman became a faculty member in the sociology department at the University of California, Berkeley, first as a visiting professor, then from 1962 as a full professor. In 1968 he moved to the University of Pennsylvania, receiving the Benjamin Franklin Chair in Sociology and Anthropology, due largely to the efforts of Dell Hymes, a former colleague at Berkeley. In 1969 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1970 Goffman became a cofounder of the American Association for the Abolition of Involuntary Mental Hospitalization and coauthored its Platform Statement. In 1971 he published &quot;Relations in Public&quot;, in which he tied together many of his ideas about everyday life, seen from a sociological perspective. Another major book of his, &quot;Frame Analysis&quot;, came out in 1974. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1977–78. In 1979, Goffman received the Cooley-Mead Award for Distinguished Scholarship, from the Section on Social Psychology of the American Sociological Association. He was elected the 73rd president of the American Sociological Association, serving in 1981–82, but was unable to deliver the presidential address in person due to progressing illness.

Posthumously, in 1983, Goffman received the Mead Award from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction.

==Influence and legacy==
Goffman was influenced by Herbert Blumer, Émile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, Everett Hughes, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Schütz, Georg Simmel and W. Lloyd Warner. Hughes was the &quot;most influential of his teachers&quot; according to Tom Burns. Gary Alan Fine and Philip Manning have said that Goffman never engaged in serious dialogue with other theorists, but his work has influenced and been discussed by numerous contemporary sociologists, including Anthony Giddens, Jürgen Habermas and Pierre Bourdieu.

Though Goffman is often associated with the symbolic interaction school of sociological thought, he did not see himself as a representative of it, and so Fine and Manning conclude that he &quot;does not easily fit within a specific school of sociological thought&quot;. His ideas are also &quot;difficult to reduce to a number of key themes&quot;; his work can be broadly described as developing &quot;a comparative, qualitative sociology that aimed to produce generalizations about human behavior&quot;.

Goffman made substantial advances in the study of face-to-face interaction, elaborated the &quot;dramaturgical approach&quot; to human interaction, and developed numerous concepts that have had a massive influence, particularly in the field of the micro-sociology of everyday life. Much of his work was about the organization of everyday behavior, a concept he termed &quot;interaction order&quot;. He contributed to the sociological concept of framing (frame analysis), to game theory (the concept of strategic interaction), and to the study of interactions and linguistics. With regard to the latter, he argued that the activity of speaking must be seen as a social rather than a linguistic construct. From a methodological perspective, Goffman often employed qualitative approaches, specifically ethnography, most famously in his study of social aspects of mental illness, in particular the functioning of total institutions. Overall, his contributions are valued as an attempt to create a theory that bridges the agency-and-structure divide—for popularizing social constructionism, symbolic interaction, conversation analysis, ethnographic studies, and the study and importance of individual interactions. His influence extended far beyond sociology: for example, his work provided the assumptions of much current research in language and social interaction within the discipline of communication.

Goffman introduced the concept of nonperson treatment as a level of social interaction.

Goffman defined &quot;impression management&quot; as a person&#x27;s attempts to present an acceptable image to those around them, verbally or nonverbally. This definition is based on Goffman&#x27;s idea that people see themselves as others view them, so they attempt to see themselves as if they are outside looking in. Goffman was also dedicated to discovering the subtle ways humans present acceptable images by concealing information that may conflict with the images for a particular situation, such as concealing tattoos when applying for a job in which tattoos would be inappropriate, or hiding a bizarre obsession such as collecting/interacting with dolls, which society may see as abnormal.

Goffman broke from George Herbert Mead and Herbert Blumer in that while he did not reject the way people perceive themselves, he was more interested in the actual physical proximity or the &quot;interaction order&quot; that molds the self. In other words, Goffman believed that impression management can be achieved only if the audience is in sync with a person&#x27;s self-perception. If the audience disagrees with the image someone is presenting then their self-presentation is interrupted. People present images of themselves based on how society thinks they should act in a particular situation. This decision how to act is based on the concept of definition of the situation. Definitions are all predetermined and people choose how they will act by choosing the proper behavior for the situation they are in. Goffman also draws from William Thomas for this concept. Thomas believed that people are born into a particular social class and that the definitions of the situations they will encounter have already been defined for them. For instance. when an individual from an upper-class background goes to a black-tie affair, the definition of the situation is that they must mind their manners and act according to their class.

In 2007 by &quot;The Times Higher Education Guide&quot; listed Goffman as the sixth most-cited author in the humanities and social sciences, behind Michel Foucault, Pierre Bourdieu, and Anthony Giddens, and ahead of Jürgen Habermas. His popularity with the general public has been attributed to his writing style, described as &quot;sardonic, satiric, jokey&quot;, and as &quot;ironic and self-consciously literary&quot;, and to its being more accessible than that of most academics. His style has also been influential in academia, and is credited with popularizing a less formal style in academic publications. Interestingly, if he is rightly so credited, he may by this means have contributed to a remodelling of the norms of academic behaviour, particularly of communicative action, arguably liberating intellectuals from social restraints unnatural to some of them.

His students included Carol Brooks Gardner, Charles Goodwin, Marjorie Harness Goodwin, John Lofland, Gary T. Marx, Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff, David Sudnow and Eviatar Zerubavel.

Despite his influence, according to Fine and Manning there are &quot;remarkably few scholars who are continuing his work&quot;, nor has there been a &quot;Goffman school&quot;; thus his impact on social theory has been simultaneously &quot;great and modest&quot;. Fine and Manning attribute the lack of subsequent Goffman-style research and writing to the nature of his style, which they consider very difficult to duplicate (even &quot;mimic-proof&quot;), and also to his subjects&#x27; not being widely valued in the social sciences. Of his style, Fine and Manning remark that he tends to be seen either as a scholar whose style is difficult to reproduce, and therefore daunting to those who might wish to emulate it, or as a scholar whose work was transitional, bridging the work of the Chicago school and that of contemporary sociologists, and thus of less interest to sociologists than the classics of either of those groups. Of his subjects, Fine and Manning observe that the topic of behavior in public places is often stigmatized as trivial and unworthy of serious scholarly attention.

Nonetheless, Fine and Manning note that Goffman is &quot;the most influential American sociologist of the twentieth century&quot;. Elliott and Turner see him as &quot;a revered figure—an outlaw theorist who came to exemplify the best of the sociological imagination&quot;, and &quot;perhaps the first postmodern sociological theorist&quot;.

==Works==
=== Early works ===
Goffman&#x27;s early works consist of his graduate writings of 1949–53. His master&#x27;s thesis was a survey of audience responses to a radio soap opera, &quot;Big Sister&quot;. One of its most important elements was a critique of his research methodology—of experimental logic and of variable analysis. Other writings from the period include &quot;Symbols of Class Status&quot; (1951) and &quot;On Cooling the Mark Out&quot; (1952). His doctoral dissertation, &quot;Communication Conduct in an Island Community&quot; (1953), presented a model of communication strategies in face-to-face interaction, and focused on how everyday rituals affect public projections of self.

Goffman&#x27;s &quot;The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life&quot; was published in 1956, with a revised edition in 1959. He had developed the book&#x27;s core ideas from his doctoral dissertation. It was Goffman&#x27;s first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association&#x27;s 1961 MacIver Award.

Goffman describes the theatrical performances that occur in face-to-face interactions. He holds that when someone comes in contact with another person, he attempts to control or guide the impression the other person will form of him, by altering his own setting, appearance and manner. At the same time, the second person attempts to form an impression of, and obtain information about, the first person. Goffman also believes that participants in social interactions engage in certain practices to avoid embarrassing themselves or others. Society is not homogeneous; we must act differently in different settings. This recognition led Goffman to his dramaturgical analysis. He saw a connection between the kinds of &quot;acts&quot; that people put on in their daily lives and theatrical performances. In a social interaction, as in a theatrical performance, there is an onstage area where actors (people) appear before the audience; this is where positive self-concepts and desired impressions are offered. But there is also a backstage—a hidden, private area where people can be themselves and drop their societal roles and identities.

===&quot;Asylums&quot;===
Goffman is sometimes credited with having coined the term &quot;total institution&quot;, though Fine and Manning note that he had heard it in lectures by Everett Hughes in reference to any institution in which people are treated alike and in which behavior is regulated. Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term, he popularized it with his 1961 book &quot;Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates&quot;. The book has been described as &quot;ethnography of the concept of the total institution&quot;. It was one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major contribution to understanding of social aspects of mental illness.

The book comprises four essays: &quot;Characteristics of Total Institutions&quot; (1957); &quot;The Moral Career of the Mental Patient&quot; (1959); &quot;The Underlife of a Public Institution: A Study of Ways of Making Out in a Mental Hospital&quot;; and &quot;The Medical Model and Mental Hospitalization: Some Notes on the Vicissitudes of the Tinkering Trades&quot;. The first three focus on the experiences of patients; the last, on professional-client interactions. Goffman is mainly concerned with the details of psychiatric hospitalization and the nature and effects of the process he calls &quot;institutionalization&quot;. He describes how institutionalization socializes people into the role of a good patient, someone &quot;dull, harmless and inconspicuous&quot;—a condition that in turn reinforces notions of chronicity in severe mental illness. Total institutions greatly affect people&#x27;s interactions; yet even in such places, people find ways to redefine their roles and reclaim their identities.

&quot;Asylums&quot; has been credited with helping catalyze the reform of mental health systems in a number of countries, leading to reductions in the numbers of large mental hospitals and of the people locked up in them. It was also influential in the anti-psychiatry movement.

===&quot;Behavior in Public Places&quot;===
In &quot;Behavior in Public Places&quot; (1963), Goffman again focuses on everyday public interactions. He draws distinctions between several types of public gatherings (&quot;gatherings&quot;, &quot;situations&quot;, &quot;social occasions&quot;) and types of audiences (acquainted versus unacquainted).

===&quot;Stigma&quot;===
Goffman&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; (1963) examines how, to protect their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves, mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame a person may feel when he or she fails to meet other people&#x27;s standards, and to the fear of being discredited—which causes the person not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information for fear of judgment by whoever that person happens to encounter.

===&quot;Interaction Ritual&quot;===
Goffman&#x27;s &quot;Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior&quot; is a collection of six essays. The first four were originally published in the 1950s, the fifth in 1964, and the last was written for the collection. They include &quot;On Face-work&quot; (1955); &quot;The Nature of Deference and Demeanor&quot; (1956); &quot;Embarrassment and Social Organization&quot; (1956); &quot;Alienation from Interaction&quot; (1957); &quot;Mental Symptoms and Public Order&quot; (1964); and &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;.

The first essay, &quot;On Face-work&quot;, discusses the concept of face, which is the positive self-image a person holds when interacting with others. Goffman believes that face &quot;as a sociological construct of interaction is neither inherent in nor a permanent aspect of the person&quot;. Once someone offers a positive self-image of him- or herself to others, they feel a need to maintain and live up to that image. Inconsistency in how a person projects him- or herself in society risks embarrassment and discredit. So people remain guarded to ensure that they do not show themselves to others in an unfavorable light.

===&quot;Strategic Interaction&quot;===
Goffman&#x27;s book &quot;Strategic Interaction&quot; (1969) is his contribution to game theory. It discusses the compatibility of game theory with the legacy of the Chicago School of sociology and with the perspective of symbolic interactionism. It is one of his few works that clearly engage with that perspective. Goffman&#x27;s view on game theory was shaped by the works of Thomas Schelling. Goffman presents reality as a form of game, and discusses its rules and the various moves that players can make (the &quot;unwitting&quot;, the &quot;naive&quot;, the &quot;covering&quot;, the &quot;uncovering&quot;, and the &quot;counter-uncovering&quot;) while trying to get or hide an information.

===&quot;Frame Analysis&quot;===
Goffman credited Gregory Bateson for creating the idea of framing and psychological frames. &quot;Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience&quot; (1974) is Goffman&#x27;s attempt to explain how conceptual frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual&#x27;s perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame is a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.

The most basic frames are called primary frameworks. A primary framework takes an individual&#x27;s experience or an aspect of a scene that would originally be meaningless and makes it meaningful. One type of primary framework is a natural framework, which identifies situations in the natural world and is completely biophysical, with no human influences. The other type of framework is a social framework, which explains events and connects them to humans. An example of a natural framework is the weather, and an example of a social framework is a meteorologist who predicts the weather. Focusing on the social frameworks, Goffman seeks to &quot;construct a general statement regarding the structure, or form, of experiences individuals have at any moment of their social life&quot;.

Goffman saw this book as his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, but it was not as popular as his earlier works.

====&quot;The Frame Analyses of Talk&quot;====

In &quot;Frame Analysis&quot;, Erving Goffman provides a platform for understanding and interpreting the interaction between individuals engaging speech communication. In the chapter &quot;The Frame Analyses of Talk,&quot; the focus is put on how words are exchanged and what is being said, specifically in informal talk or conversation. The concept of framing is introduced through an exploration of why misunderstandings occur in these basic, everyday conversations. He argues that they are more errors in verbal framing than anything else. The types of frames Goffman is considering are discussed in previous sections of the book, &quot;fabrications, keyings, frame breaks, misframing, and, of course, frame disputes.&quot; That a frame can assume so many forms is the basis of his analyses, &quot;these framings are subject to a multitude of different
transformations − the warrant for a frame analysis in the first place.&quot;

Goffman&#x27;s key idea is that most conversation is simply a replaying of a strip – what he describes as a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker&#x27;s goal is often always the same, to provide &quot;evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation.&quot; Essentially, through interaction, we are only looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.

Goffman explains that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech. Key is probably best understood as the tone of the dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. Signaling a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, &quot;special brackets will have to be introduced should he want to say something in a relatively serious way: &quot;Kidding aside,&quot; &quot;Now, I&#x27;m really serious about this,&quot; and other such tags become necessary as a means of momentarily down keying the flow of words.&quot;

Folklorist Richard Bauman builds heavily on Goffman&#x27;s work, specifically on the idea of key, in his work pertaining to an analysis of the performance frame. Bauman details that a performance is dependent on it being properly keyed, without this, the display will not be successful. His work on performance analyses is deeply indebted to what Goffman establishes here in &quot;Frame Analyses.&quot;

Context is one other element to framing that is essential. &quot;The participants will be bound by norms of good manners: through frequency and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through circumspection in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly-through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due.&quot; Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another. An awareness of these social framings is critical, just as is an awareness of the audience. Depending on who you&#x27;re speaking with (a teacher, a child, a loved one, a friend, a pet, etc.) you will curve your speech to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting.

Goffman uses the metaphor of conversation being a stage play. A play&#x27;s tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; this is similar to how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they are often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.

Other similarities include engaging in the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside the knowledge that the performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains &quot;the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller&#x27;s suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.&quot; Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.

===&quot;Gender Advertisements&quot;===
In &quot;Gender Advertisements&quot;, Goffman analyzes how gender is represented in the advertising to which all individuals are commonly exposed.

In her 2001 work &quot;Measuring Up: How Advertising Affects Self-Image&quot;, Vickie Rutledge Shields stated that the work was &quot;unique at the time for employing a method now being labeled &#x27;semiotic content analysis&#x27;&quot; and that it &quot;[provided] the base for textual analyses ... such as poststructuralist and psychoanalytic approaches&quot;. She also noted that feminist scholars like Jean Kilbourne &quot;[built] their highly persuasive and widely circulated findings on the nature of gender in advertising on Goffman&#x27;s original categories&quot;.

===&quot;Forms of Talk&quot;===
Goffman&#x27;s book, &quot;Forms of Talk&quot; (1981), includes five essays: &quot;Replies and Responses&quot; (1976); &quot;Response Cries&quot; (1978); &quot;Footing&quot; (1979); &quot;The Lecture&quot; (1976); and &quot;Radio Talk&quot; (1981). Each essay addresses both verbal and non-verbal communication through a sociolinguistic model. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the study of talk. In the introduction, Goffman identifies three themes that recur throughout the text: &quot;ritualization, participation framework, and embedding&quot;.

The first essay, &quot;Replies and Responses&quot;, concerns &quot;conversational dialogue&quot; and the way people respond during a conversation, both verbally and non-verbally. The second essay, &quot;Response Cries&quot;, considers the use of utterances and their social implications in different social contexts. Specifically, Goffman discusses &quot;self-talk&quot; (talking to no one in particular) and its role in social situations. Next, in &quot;Footing&quot;, Goffman addresses the way that footing, or alignment, can shift during a conversation. The fourth essay, &quot;The Lecture&quot;, originally an oral presentation, describes different types and methods of lecture. Lastly, in &quot;Radio Talk&quot;, Goffman describes the types and forms of talk used in radio programming and the effect they have on listeners.

<doc id="186419" wikidata="Q3087616" url="?curid=186419" title="Friar Park">
<text>Friar Park is a Victorian neo-Gothic mansion in Henley-on-Thames, England, construction began in 1889 and was completed in 1895. It was built for lawyer Sir Frank Crisp, and purchased in January 1970 by English rock musician and former Beatle George Harrison. The site covers about 30 acres, and features caves, grottoes, underground passages, a multitude of garden gnomes, and an Alpine rock garden with a scale model of the Matterhorn.

==Overview==
The main house is listed Grade II on the National Heritage List, and the gardens of Friar Park are also listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In addition to the main house, the Lower Lodge, Middle Lodge, and Upper Lodge are all also individually listed Grade II. The entrance walls and piers of the Lower Lodge, and the railed wall piers and gates of the Middle Lodge are also listed Grade II.

Reports claiming that the building has 120 rooms were denied by current owner Olivia Harrison, while speaking to NPR &quot;Fresh Air&quot; in March 2004, at which time she said that, while she didn&#x27;t know how many rooms there are, 120 is an over-statement.

Since the early 1970s, the property has become synonymous with the former Beatle&#x27;s home studio, known as FPSHOT (i.e., &quot;Friar Park Studio, Henley-On-Thames&quot;). Harrison biographer Alan Clayson has described the Friar Park estate as being &quot;as synonymous with his name as the Queen&#x27;s with Windsor Castle&quot;.

The rumours and tabloid press reports claiming Harrison put the property up as collateral in order to fund the Monty Python comedy team&#x27;s movie &quot;Life of Brian&quot;, after their original backers, EMI, pulled out at the last minute, is unfounded. The budget for the feature film in 1979 was $4 million. At the same time, Friar Park was worth less than £200,000. The rumour was an &quot;inside joke&quot; that was turned into a marketing scheme stating that Harrison simply wanted to get to see the film, something that his friend Eric Idle described for promotional purposes as &quot;the most expensive cinema ticket in movie history&quot;.

==History==
The Friar Park estate was owned by Sir Frank Crisp from 1889 until his death in 1919. The property was then sold at an auction to Sir Percival David. Following their divorce, Lady David moved into the Coachman&#x27;s Cottage on the south-west corner of the property when the rest of the estate was donated for the use of nuns belonging to the Salesians of Don Bosco order. The nuns ran a local school in Henley, the Sacred Heart School, but, by the late 1960s, Friar Park was in a state of disrepair. The rumour that Friar Park was due to be demolished was unfounded and was little more than an &quot;off-the-cuff&quot; comment without any factual basis.

==George Harrison and FPSHOT==
In early 1972, Harrison installed a 16-track tape-based recording studio in a guest suite, which, at one point, was superior to the one at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios. By 1974, the facility had become the recording headquarters for his record label, Dark Horse Records. The album covers for projects Harrison recorded there usually mentioned &quot;F.P.S.H.O.T.&quot; – Friar Park Studio, Henley-on-Thames. These include the bulk of his own albums, from 1973&#x27;s &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; onwards; among them, &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot;, &quot;George Harrison&quot;, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and &quot;Brainwashed&quot;. 

In addition to Harrison&#x27;s solo albums, overdubs for the two Traveling Wilburys releases and the recording and filming of The Beatles&#x27; 1995 &quot;Anthology&quot; project were also recorded at Friar Park Studio Henley-on-Thames. In 1996, Harrison recorded and produced the album &quot;Chants of India&quot; for Ravi Shankar at FPSHOT. Interviews with family and friends for posthumous documentaries such as 2003&#x27;s &quot;Concert for George&quot;, the 2005 &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; DVD release, and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;George Harrison: Living in the Material World&quot; in 2011 were all conducted at FPSHOT or in the residential part of the house.

Besides the records by Harrison or artists he produced, the studio was also used by Shakespears Sister to record their 1992 album &quot;Hormonally Yours&quot;.

==The gardens==
In the foreword to Harrison&#x27;s 1980 memoir &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot;, Derek Taylor writes of Harrison&#x27;s purchase of Friar Park: &quot;It is a dream on a hill and it came, not by chance, to the right man at the right time.&quot;

Friar Park once had extensive gardens and water features that were designed by Henry Ernest Milner for Crisp, including a grotto, and stones just underneath the surface of the pond (providing a walking-on-water illusion). The majority of the gardens that once existed at Friar Park are long gone, having been on land that is no longer part of the estate, or on land that was overgrown with mature trees, or was repurposed. The Rockery to the northwest of the mansion includes a sandstone replica of the Matterhorn Reflecting Crisp&#x27;s sense of humour; among the statuary is a friar holding a frying pan with holes in it, and a plaque reading &quot;Two Holy Friars&quot;. The year Harrison and his first wife, Pattie Boyd, moved in, he was photographed among four garden gnomes located on the main lawn for the cover of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;, and again with his father Harry six years later, with the photo appearing inside the gatefold cover of &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot;.

Harrison immortalised the grand building and its surrounds in his 1976 song &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot;. Contrary to popular belief, George Harrison never referred to his estate as &quot;Crackerbox Palace.&quot; Instead, Crackerbox Palace was the nickname for the California home of comedian Lord Buckley which was the actual inspiration for the song and its title. This rumour began as a consequence of George Harrison filming a promotional film (Crackerbox Palace) at the estate for the sake of convenience. The &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; track &quot;Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)&quot; was inspired by Friar Park&#x27;s history, and the lyrics of later songs such as &quot;Ding Dong, Ding Dong&quot; and &quot;The Answer&#x27;s at the End&quot; directly quote from the many carvings around the property. His humorous video clips for the likes of &quot;Ding Dong, Ding Dong&quot;, &quot;True Love&quot;, and &quot;Crackerbox Palace&quot; were all shot within the gardens and grounds of Friar Park, as were the album covers for some of his FPSHOT-recorded Dark Horse acts − Splinter&#x27;s &quot;The Place I Love&quot; and the album &quot;Ravi Shankar&#x27;s Music Festival from India&quot; being the most obvious.

Harrison restored very few (not all, as is often incorrectly reported) of the remaining gardens, essentially limited mostly to the Alpine Garden, Topiary Garden, Dutch Knot Garden, Japanese Garden, as well as glass houses and lake system. Until his death in November 2001, he loved tending to them personally − an activity that a visiting &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist in 1987 deemed a &quot;decidedly un-rock-star-ish pastime&quot; − and among the groundskeepers were his older brothers Peter and Harry. Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani remembered: &quot;He&#x27;d garden at night-time until midnight. He&#x27;d be out there squinting because he could see, at midnight, the moonlight and shadows, and that was his way of not seeing the weeds or imperfections that would plague him during the day.&quot; Talking of the tranquility he felt at Friar Park, Harrison once said: &quot;Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m actually on the wrong planet, and it&#x27;s great when I&#x27;m in my garden. But the minute I go out the gate I think: &#x27;What the hell am I doing here?&#x27;&quot;

During Crisp&#x27;s time at Friar Park, the grounds were open to the public once a week during the spring and summer. Following the murder of John Lennon, Harrison&#x27;s Beatles bandmate, in December 1980, the gates were locked and security features such as fences and video cameras installed. Despite these measures, an intruder, Michael Abram, broke into the residence in the early hours of 30 December 1999, attacking Harrison and his wife Olivia, and leaving Harrison with five stab wounds and a punctured lung.

<text>Tommy McClennan (January 4, 1905 – May 9, 1961) was an American Delta blues singer and guitarist.

==Life and career==
McClennan was born in Durant, Mississippi, and grew up in the town. He played and sang blues in a rough, energetic style.

He made a series of recordings for Bluebird Records from 1939 through 1942. He regularly played with his friend Robert Petway. His voice is heard in the background on Petway&#x27;s recording of &quot;Boogie Woogie Woman&quot; (1942). McClennan&#x27;s singles in this period included &quot;Bottle It Up and Go&quot;, &quot;New Highway No. 51&quot;, &quot;Shake &#x27;Em on Down&quot;, and &quot;Whiskey Head Woman&quot;.

Several of his songs have been covered by other musicians, including &quot;Cross Cut Saw Blues&quot; (covered by Albert King) and &quot;My Baby&#x27;s Gone&quot; (Moon Mullican). McClennan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Guitar King&quot; was included in the 1959 collection &quot;The Country Blues&quot;, issued by Folkways Records.

McClennan died of bronchopneumonia in Chicago, Illinois, on May 9, 1961.

==Citation==
&quot;He had a different style of playing a guitar&quot;, Big Bill Broonzy said. &quot;You just make the chords and change when you feel like changing&quot;

John Fahey&#x27;s &quot;Screaming and Hollerin&#x27; the Blues&quot; contains an interview with Booker Miller, a contemporary of Charlie Patton&#x27;s, in which Miller mentioned someone who is most likely Tommy McClennan, though Miller did not know his name: &quot;... and I saw another fella he put some records out, they (him and Willie Brown) be together, but he be by himself when I see him, they called him &quot;Sugar&quot;... I ain&#x27;t never known him as nothing but Sugar, he put out a record called Bottle Up and Go... I sold him my guitar.&quot;

Bob Dylan covered Tommy McClennan&#x27;s track, &quot;Highway 51&quot; (which was written by Curtis Jones), on his self-titled debut album in 1962.

<doc id="186440" wikidata="Q1756711" url="?curid=186440" title="Video rental shop">
<text>A video rental shop/store is a physical retail business that rents home videos such as movies, prerecorded TV shows, video game cartridges/discs and other media content. Typically, a rental shop conducts business with customers under conditions and terms agreed upon in a rental agreement or contract, which may be implied, explicit, or written. Many video rental stores also sell previously viewed movies and/or new, unopened movies.

In the 1980s, video rental stores rented VHS and Betamax tapes of movies; however, most stores dropped Betamax tapes when VHS won the format war late in the decade. In the 2000s, video rental stores began renting DVDs, a digital format with higher resolution than VHS. In the late 2000s, stores began selling and renting Blu-ray discs, a format that supports high definition resolution.

Video rental stores have experienced a significant decline in the 21st century. Increasing accessibility of electronic medias in library circulation and widespread adoption of video on demand and video streaming services such as Netflix in the 2010s sharply reduced the revenues of most major rental chains, leading to the closure of most locations. Due to the precipitous drop in demand, few rental shops have survived into the present day. As of 2022, the small number of remaining stores tend to cater to film buffs seeking classic and historic films, art films, independent films, foreign language films, and cult films that are less available on streaming platforms.

==History==
===1970s===
The world&#x27;s oldest business renting out copies of movies for private use was a film reel rental shop opened by Eckhard Baum in Kassel, Germany in the summer of 1975. Baum collected movies on Super 8 film as a hobby and lent pieces of his collection to friends and acquaintances. Because they showed great interest in his films, he came up with the idea of renting out films as a sideline. Over the years, videotapes and optical discs were added to the range. As of April 2023, Baum still operates the business; the business was portrayed in the June 2006 documentary film &quot;Eckis Welt&quot; by Olaf Saumer.

The first professionally managed video rental store in the U.S., Video Station, was opened by George Atkinson in December 1977 at 12011 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. After 20th Century Fox had signed an agreement with Magnetic Video founder Andre Blay to license him 50 of their titles for sale directly to consumers, amongst them &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;The French Connection&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, Atkinson bought all the titles in both VHS and Beta formats, and offered them for rent. Such stores led to the creation of video rental chains such as West Coast Video, Blockbuster Video, and Rogers Video in the 1980s.

Sony released its first commercially available video recorders in the United States on June 7, 1975; the following year, on October 25, 1976, Universal and Disney filed a lawsuit against Sony in the case known as Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. The two studios tried to ban the sales of VCRs, and later the rental of movies, which would have destroyed the video rental business in the US. Justice Harry Blackmun sided with the studios, while Justice John Paul Stevens ruled in Sony&#x27;s favor. Eventually, on January 17, 1984, the Supreme Court overruled the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor changed her mind, leading to a 5-to-4 ruling.

===1980s===

Video games started being rented in video shops from 1982. Some of the earliest game cartridges available for rental included &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Frogger&quot; and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. However, not many stores made them available for rental at the time. In Japan, Nintendo Entertainment System games could be rented as early as 1983. However, in response to rental stores making pirated copies of game cartridges, video game companies, as well as the Recording Industry Association of Japan and trade associations, lobbied for an amendment to the Japanese Copyright Act that banned the rental of video games in Japan in 1984. Some video game companies intentionally made their games more difficult to prevent them from being beaten during the rental period, in the hopes players would purchase games instead of renting.

By mid-1985, the United States had 15,000 video rental stores; further, many record, grocery, and drug stores also rented videotapes. By May 1988, the number of specialty video stores was estimated to be 25,000, in addition to 45,000 other outlets that also offered video rentals. Grocery stores in the US rented tapes for as little as $0.49 as loss leaders. The press discussed the VCR &quot;and the viewing habits it has engendered — the Saturday night trip down to the tape rental store to pick out for a couple of bucks the movie you want to see when you want to see it&quot;. Video rental stores had customers of all ages and were part of a fast-growing business. By 1987, for example, Pennsylvania had 537 stores that primarily rented videotapes, with annual spending per resident of $10.50. By 1989, six years after its founding, Philadelphia&#x27;s West Coast Video operated over 700 stores in the US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. In 1987, home video market revenues for the year surpassed box office revenues.

In the 1980s, it was common for shops to rent equipment—typically VHS recorders—as well as tapes. Some video shops also had adults-only sections containing X-rated videos. Some video 
stores exclusively sold X-rated suggestive films, often along with related sex shop items. To cope with the videotape format war of the 1970s and 1980s, some stores initially stocked both VHS and Betamax cassettes, while others specialized in one format or the other. During the 1980s, most stores eventually phased out their Betamax section and became all-VHS, contributing to the eventual demise of Beta as a home video format (nevertheless, the Beta form factor remained in use as a professional video format in broadcasting as Betacam).

===1990s–2000s===

In the late 1990s, DVDs began appearing in video rental stores. The format was smaller than tapes, allowing stores to stock more movies. As well, the thin, lightweight discs could be mailed, which made mail DVD services feasible.
In the late 1990s, Netflix offered a per-rental model for each DVD but introduced a monthly subscription for DVDs concept in September 1999. The per-rental model was dropped by early 2000, allowing the company to focus on the business model of flat-fee unlimited rentals without due dates, late fees (a source of annoyance for bricks and mortar video store customers), shipping and handling fees, or per-title rental fees.

Rogers Video was the first chain to provide DVD rentals in Canada. Other chains and independent stores later transitioned to the newer format. Similarly, many video stores rented Blu-ray Disc movies after the high definition optical disc format war ended in the late 2000s.

Some firms rented DVDs from automatic kiosk machines such as Redbox. Customers selected a movie from a list using buttons, paid by credit card, and the movie popped out of a slot. While traditional brick and mortar video rental stores were closing at a high rate, Redbox moved into existing retail locations such as supermarkets, and placed kiosks within them or outside of them to gain access to that consumer base. As well, with Redbox, consumers could rent the movie at one kiosk (for example, one near their work) and return it to any Redbox kiosk (for example, one near their home), thus increasing convenience. Redbox surpassed Blockbuster in 2007 in the number of US locations, passed 100 million rentals in February 2008, and passed 1 billion rentals in September 2010.

Automatic DVD kiosks still required consumers to leave home twice, to rent the movie and return it. Widespread availability of video on demand (VOD) on cable TV systems and VHS-by-mail and DVD-by-mail services offered consumers a way of watching movies without having to leave home. Consumers preferred the convenience of choosing movies at home.

With the advent of the World Wide Web, Internet services which streamed content as Netflix became increasingly popular starting in the mid–2000s. All the new ways of watching movies greatly reduced demand for video rental shops, and many closed as a result. In 2000, there were 27,882 stores renting videos open in the US, by late 2015, the number was down to 4,445. Over 86% of the 15,300 U.S. stores (specializing in video rentals) open in 2007 were reported to have closed by 2017, bringing the total to approximately 2,140 remaining stores. The total income from brick and mortar rentals for 2017 was about $390 million.

In mid-June 2020, Malaysian video rental chain Speedy Video closed its 14 remaining shops in response to competition from satellite television and streaming platforms. In Asia, video rental stores faced the additional challenge of dealing with rampant video piracy.

On January 5, 2021, Glenview, Illinois-based Family Video announced it was closing all its remaining video rental stores. The company was the last remaining video rental chain in the United States; its closing marked the end of large video rental chains.

In the 2020s, some video stores facing the loss of their business model have adapted by becoming non-profit organizations that focus on preserving an archive of film heritage and educating people about cinema. Operating as a non-profit enables a video store to use volunteer personnel and apply for foundation grants, which can make it feasible to operate with less rental revenue.

Meanwhile, at the end of 2022, there are still more than 2,000 video rental stores in Japan, including Tsutaya and Geo. However, as is typical, the number is decreasing year by year. In addition, Redbox
has nearly 40,000 vending machine-type stores in the U.S. as of 2021.

In 2022, CBC News reported that Ottawa still has two DVD rental stores: Movies n&#x27; Stuff (12,000 titles for rent and 40,000 more in storage) and Glebe Video International (18,000 titles for rent).
Movies n&#x27; Stuff&#x27;s owner, Peter Thompson, attributes the continued interest in video rental stores to the rising cost of streaming subscription services and patrons&#x27; desire for the personalized film recommendations he provides. 
On April 23, 2024, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment, Redbox&#x27;s parent, announced a $636.6 million loss in 2023, and warned that without any options to generate additional financing, the company may be forced to liquidate or pause operations, and seek a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing. However, Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment did also report that Redbox&#x27;s sales increased last year, seeing a 66% increase in annual revenue to $112.7 million. On June 29, 2024, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after missing a week of paying its employees and failing to secure financing.

On July 10, 2024, a bankruptcy judge ordered to convert Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment&#x27;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation after accusing the company&#x27;s previous CEO of misusing the business and failing to pay employees or support healthcare. Over 1,000 employees were laid off and over 26,000 Redbox kiosks will shut down permanently, marking the end of major physical video rental services in the United States.

==Legacy and sociocultural impact==
According to Daniel Herbert, a film professor at the University of Michigan, video rental stores &quot;helped cement a local &#x27;movie culture&#x27; and contribute to the social fabric of a community in small but meaningful ways&quot;, in that customers sought advice from staff on what film to rent or chatted with other customers about &quot;what to watch and why.&quot;

Film critic Collin Souter states that video stores gave &quot;film lovers&quot; a place &quot;to congregate&quot; and make &quot;discoveries by browsing&quot; the racks of film shelves, with the store providing a &quot;film school, a social gathering, a place of cinematic discovery, date nights, and rites of passage.&quot; He underscores the impact that video stores had by noting that when film director Quentin Tarantino, a former video rental store employee, learned that Video Archives in Hermosa Beach California (the store he had worked at) was closing, he bought the entire &quot;inventory and recreated the store in his basement&quot;, as for him, &quot;that place [was] a lifesaver.&quot;

A 2018 article about video stores states that they are appealing because &quot;people crave being together to pick entertainment&quot; and the chance to &quot;chat with a staff member&quot; &quot;who can be relied upon for reviews and recommendations and who truly love what they do&quot;; at the same time, they are &quot;part of a &quot;community of like-minded individuals.&quot; One argument for video stores is the element of investment; if &quot;you&#x27;re taking time to walk into a physical place, grab something and take it home, you&#x27;ll be at least a little bit invested.&quot;

As well, there is the &quot;allure of browsing&quot; the physical copies on the shelves (an appeal likened to the resurgence of interest in vinyl records in the 2020s).

Such video rental stores as Toronto&#x27;s Bay St Video have a larger selection than a streaming platform&#x27;s movie list. The owner of Bay St Video states that they &quot;have movies that go back to the beginning of filmmaking, from the first silent films ever made to stuff that was just in theatres – and everything in between. We have the history of cinema.” He calls the store&#x27;s selection of films &quot;libraryesque – almost like an archive or a museum.” Benjamin Owens, the owner of Film is Truth, a non-profit video rental outlet, points out that video stores may carry a larger selection of films than streaming platforms; he notes that while the &quot;largest streaming provider, Netflix, has only 6,000 titles&quot;, Film is Truth has over 20,000 titles. An additional benefit that video stores provide to communities is that they give access to films to people with poor access to Internet and those who are not comfortably with adapting to online consumption.

In 2010, Daniel Hanna, the owner of Toronto&#x27;s Eyesore Cinema (an independent video shop) launched International Independent Video Store Day, which is held on the third Saturday of every October, to promote awareness of video rental stores and their unique contribution to film culture. 
Film professor Daniel Herbert says that the demise of the video store may affect independent film production. He states that studios lost a major channel for low-budget, feature-length indie movies when the large video store chains collapsed. Streaming services are less likely to produce this format, as they prefer binge-watching-oriented serials. Richard Brody argues that between 1985 and 1995, there was &quot;a generation of filmmakers that included Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh, whose first films, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot;, respectively, were financed&quot; by the home video market. Brody argues that for aspiring filmmakers, video stores they worked at became &quot;launching pads of true outsiders&quot;, and provided &quot;counter-programming&quot; to film school training by valorizing &quot;anti-academic values of disorder, spontaneity, and enthusiasm.&quot;

&quot;Friday Night at the Video Store&quot; is a National Film Board documentary directed by Cédric Chabuel and Alexandra Viau that aims to &quot;record and preserve a vestige of the brief existence&quot; of five video store owners who &quot;cling to their dream of keeping the video rental industry alive.&quot;

===In popular culture ===
The impact of video rental stores on popular culture is attested to by filmmakers&#x27; use of video stores as a setting for a number of films from the 1980s to the 2000s. Examples include &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot; (2008), in which Jack Black and Mos Def play rental store staff in a shop scheduled for demolition; &quot;Clerks&quot; (1994), which depicts a day in the life of two bored, annoyed clerks, one that works in a video store; &quot;Speaking Parts&quot; (1989), a film directed by Atom Egoyan about a video rental store customer whose obsession with a minor actor pushes her to rent every film he has a bit part in; &quot;Remote Control&quot; (1988), a science fiction film about alien brainwashing scheme that uses a message hidden in a VHS tape, in which Kevin Dillon plays the role of a video store clerk; &quot;Air Doll&quot; (2009) a Japanese film about a blow-up doll that comes to life and begins working in a video rental store; &quot;Bleeder&quot; (1999), a Nicolas Winding Refn film in which Mads Mikkelsen plays a lonely video store clerk; and &quot;Watching the Detectives&quot; (2007), a film in which Cillian Murphy plays a video store clerk who is a film buff who tries to get his customers interested in cinema.

The decline of chain video stores was later addressed by the documentary film &quot;The Last Blockbuster&quot; (2020) and the TV sitcom &quot;Blockbuster&quot; (2022), a fictionalized version of the same premise.

==Rental and copyright==
Renting books, optical discs, tapes, and movies is covered by copyright law. Copyright owners sometimes put warning notices on the packaging of products such as DVDs to deter copyright infringement such as copying of movies.

In Canada, movies are protected under the &quot;Canadian Copyright Act&quot;, so shifting from one format to another (e.g. &quot;ripping&quot; a digital copy of a rental DVD movie) is illegal. In 2012, public school teachers were granted some exemptions for the exhibition of films, when the Canadian Parliament passed the &quot;Copyright Modernization Act&quot;. Teachers can show &quot;copyrighted commercially available movies for educational purposes&quot;, so long as it is part of a &quot;classroom curriculum related context.&quot;

In the United States, Title 17 of the United States Code indicates that it is &quot;illegal to reproduce a copyrighted work&quot; such as a rented VHS tape or DVD movie.

In some cases, consumer rights in Europe and the US are significantly broader than those described in copyright warning labels. In the U.S., with narrow exceptions for religious and educational purpsoses, a person who shows a rental video outside of a home must pay for an exhibition license.

<text>Falsetto ( , ; Italian diminutive of , &quot;false&quot;) is the vocal register occupying the frequency range just above the modal voice register and overlapping with it by approximately one octave.

It is produced by the vibration of the ligamentous edges of the vocal cords, in whole or in part. Commonly cited in the context of singing, falsetto, a characteristic of phonation by both sexes, is also one of four main spoken vocal registers recognized by speech pathology.

The term &quot;falsetto&quot; is most often used in the context of singing to refer to a type of vocal phonation that enables the singer to sing notes beyond the vocal range of the normal or modal voice. The typical tone of falsetto register or M2, usually has a characteristic breathy and flute-like sound relatively free of overtones—which is more limited than its modal counterpart in both dynamic variation and tone quality. However, William Vennard points out that while most untrained people can sound comparatively &quot;breathy&quot; or &quot;hooty&quot; when using falsetto production, there are in rarer cases individuals who have developed a much stronger falsetto sound production, which has more &quot;ring&quot; to it.

==Anatomical process==
The modal voice, or modal register, and falsetto register differ primarily in the action of the vocal cords. Production of the normal voice involves vibration of the entire vocal cord, with the glottis opening first at the bottom and then at the top. Production of falsetto, on the other hand, vibrates only the ligamentous edges of the vocal folds while leaving each fold&#x27;s body relatively relaxed. Transition from modal voice to falsetto occurs when each vocal cord&#x27;s main body, or vocalis muscle, relaxes, enabling the cricothyroid muscles to stretch the vocal ligaments. William Vennard describes this process as follows:

In the modal register, the vocal folds (when viewed with a stroboscope) are seen to contact with each other completely during each vibration, closing the gap between them fully, if just for a very short time. This closure cuts off the escaping air. When the air pressure in the trachea rises as a result of this closure, the folds are blown apart, while the vocal processes of the arytenoid cartilages remain in apposition. This creates an oval gap between the folds and some air escapes, lowering the pressure inside the trachea. Rhythmic repetition of this movement creates the note.

In falsetto, however, the vocal folds are seen to be blown apart, and in untrained falsetto singers, a permanent oval orifice is left in the middle between the edges of the two folds through which a certain volume of air escapes continuously as long as the register is engaged (the singer is singing using the voice). In skilled countertenors, however, the mucous membrane of the vocal folds contact with each other completely during each vibration cycle. The arytenoid cartilages are held in firm apposition in this voice register also. The length or size of the oval orifice or separation between the folds can vary, but it is known to get bigger as the pressure of air pushed out is increased.

The folds are made up of elastic and fatty tissue. The folds are covered on the surface by laryngeal mucous membrane, which is supported deeper down underneath by the innermost fibres of the thyroarytenoid muscle. In falsetto, the extreme membranous edges (i.e., the edges furthest away from the middle of the gap between the folds) appear to be the only parts vibrating. The mass corresponding to the innermost part of the thyroarytenoid muscle remains still and motionless.

Some singers feel a sense of muscular relief when they change from the modal register to the falsetto register.

Research has revealed that not all speakers and singers produce falsetto in exactly the same way. Some speakers and singers leave the cartilaginous portion of the glottis open (sometimes called &#x27;mutational chink&#x27;), and only the front two-thirds of the vocal ligaments enter the vibration. The resulting sound, which is typical of many adolescents, may be pure and flutelike, but is usually soft and anemic in quality. In others, the full length of the glottis opens and closes in each cycle. In still others, a phenomenon known as damping appears, with the amount of glottal opening becoming less and less as the pitch rises, until only a tiny slit appears on the highest pitches. The mutational chink type of falsetto is considered inefficient and weak, but there is little information available about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the other two types.

==Female falsetto==
Both sexes are physically capable of phonating in the falsetto register. Prior to research done by scientists in the 1950s and 1960s, it was widely believed that only men were able to produce falsetto. One possible explanation for this failure to recognize the female falsetto sooner is that when men phonate in the falsetto register there is a much more pronounced change in timbre and dynamic level between the modal and falsetto registers than there is in female voices. This is due in part to the difference in the length and mass of the vocal folds and to the difference in frequency ranges. However, motion picture and video studies of laryngeal action prove that women can and do produce falsetto, and electromyographic studies by several leading speech pathologists and vocal pedagogists provide further confirmation.

While scientific evidence has proven that women have a falsetto register, the issue of &#x27;female falsetto&#x27; has been met with controversy among teachers of singing. This controversy does not exist within the sciences and arguments against the existence of female falsetto do not align with current physiological evidence. Some pioneers in vocal pedagogy, like Margaret Green and William Vennard, were quick to adopt current scientific research in the 1950s, and pursued capturing the biological process of female falsetto on film. They went further to incorporate their research into their pedagogical method of teaching female singers. Others refused to accept the idea, and opposition to the concept of female falsetto has continued among some teachers of singing long after scientific evidence had proven the existence of female falsetto. Celebrated opera singer and voice teacher Richard Miller pointed out in his 1997 publication &quot;National Schools of Singing: English, French, German, and Italian&quot; that while the German school of voice teachers had largely embraced the idea of a female falsetto into pedagogical practice, there is division within the French and English schools and a complete rejection of the idea of female falsetto in the Italian school of singing. In his 2004 book, &quot;Solutions for Singers: Tools For Performers and Teachers&quot;, Miller said, &quot;It is illogical to speak of a female falsetto, because the female is incapable of producing a timbre in the upper range that is radically different from its &quot;mezza voce&quot; or &quot;voce piena in testa&quot; qualities&quot;.

However, other writers of singing have warned about the dangers of failing to recognize that women have a falsetto register. McKinney, who expressed alarm that many books on the art of singing completely ignore or gloss over the issue of female falsetto or insist that women do not have falsetto, argues that many young female singers substitute falsetto for the upper portion of the modal voice. He believes that this failure to recognize the female falsetto voice has led to the misidentification of young contraltos and mezzo-sopranos as sopranos, as it is easier for these lower voice types to sing in the soprano &quot;tessitura&quot; using their falsetto register.

==Musical history==
Use of falsetto voice in western music is very old. Its origins are difficult to trace because of ambiguities in terminology. Possibly when 13th century writers distinguished between chest, throat and head registers (&quot;pectoris, guttoris, capitis&quot;) they meant capitis to refer to what would be later called falsetto. By the 16th century the term falsetto was common in Italy. The physician, Giovanni Camillo Maffei, in his book &quot;Discorso della voce e del modo d&#x27;apparare di cantar di garganta&quot; in 1562, explained that when a bass singer sang in the soprano range, the voice was called &quot;falsetto&quot;. In a book by GB Mancini, called &quot;Pensieri e riflessioni&quot; written in 1774, falsetto is equated with &quot;voce di testa&quot; (translated as &#x27;head voice&#x27;).

The falsetto register is used by male countertenors to sing in the alto and occasionally the soprano range and was the standard before women sang in choirs. Falsetto is occasionally used by early music specialists today and regularly in British cathedral choirs by men who sing the alto line.

There is a difference between the modern usage of the &quot;head voice&quot; term and its previous meaning in the renaissance as a type of falsetto, according to many singing professionals. These days, head voice is typically defined as a mix of chest and head voice, therefore created a stronger sound than falsetto. The falsetto can be coloured or changed to sound different. It can be given classical styling to sound as male classical countertenors make it sound, or be sung in more contemporary musical styles.

In opera, it is believed that the chest voice, middle voice and head voice occur in women. The head voice of a man is, according to David A. Clippinger generally equivalent to the middle voice of a woman. This may mean the head voice of a woman is a man&#x27;s falsetto equivalent. Although, in contemporary teaching, some teachers no longer talk of the middle voice, choosing to call it the head voice as with men. Falsetto is not generally counted by classical purists as a part of the vocal range of anyone except countertenors. There are exceptions, however, such as the baryton-Martin which uses falsetto (see baritone article).

==Use in singing==
Falsetto is more limited in dynamic variation and tone quality than the modal voice. Falsetto does not connect to modal voice except at very low volumes, leading to vocal breaks when transitioning from modal voice. In the absence of modern vocal training to hold back the volume of modal voice, in this overlapping area a given pitch in modal voice will be louder than the same pitch sung in falsetto. The type of vocal cord vibration that produces the falsetto voice precludes loud singing except in the highest tones of that register; it also limits the available tone colors because of the simplicity of its waveform. Modal voice is capable of producing much more complex waveforms and infinite varieties of tone color. Falsetto, however, does involve less physical effort by the singer than the modal voice and, when properly used, can make possible some desirable tonal effects.

==Use in speech==
The ability to speak within the falsetto register is possible for almost all men and women. The use of falsetto is considered uncommon in normal Western speech and is most often employed within the context of humor. However, the use of falsetto speech varies by culture and its use has been studied in African Americans and gay men in certain contexts. Its use has also been noted in the U.S. South. Pitch changes ranging to falsetto are also characteristic of British English.

Some people who speak frequently or entirely in the falsetto register are identified by speech pathologists as suffering from a functional dysphonia. Falsetto also describes the momentary, but often repeated, fluctuations in pitch emitted by both sexes while undergoing voice change during adolescence. These changes, however, are more apparent and occur with greater frequency in boys than they do in girls. Failure to undergo proper voice-change is called puberphonia.

<doc id="186447" wikidata="Q163967" url="?curid=186447" title="Peneplain">
<text>In geomorphology and geology, a peneplain is a low-relief plain formed by protracted erosion. This is the definition in the broadest of terms, albeit with frequency the usage of peneplain is meant to imply the representation of a near-final (or penultimate) stage of fluvial erosion during times of extended tectonic stability. Peneplains are sometimes associated with the cycle of erosion theory of William Morris Davis, but Davis and other workers have also used the term in a purely descriptive manner without any theory or particular genesis attached.

==Discussion==
The existence of some peneplains, and peneplanation as a process in nature, is not without controversy, due to a lack of contemporary examples and uncertainty in identifying relic examples. By some definitions, peneplains grade down to a base level represented by sea level, yet in other definitions such a condition is ignored. Geomorphologist Karna Lidmar-Bergström and co-workers consider the base level criterion crucial and above the precise mechanism of formation of peneplains, including this way some pediplains among peneplains.

While peneplains are usually assumed to form near sea level it has also been posited that peneplains can form at height if extensive sedimentation raises the local base level sufficiently or if river networks are continuously obstructed by tectonic deformation. The peneplains of the Pyrenees and Tibetan Plateau may exemplify these two cases respectively.

A common misconception about peneplains is that they ought to be so plain they are featureless. In fact, some peneplains may be hilly as they reflect irregular deep weathering, forming a plain grading to a base level only at a grand-scale.

At the grand-scale peneplains are characterized by appearing to be sculpted in rock with disregard of rock structure and lithology, but in detail, their shape is structurally controlled, for example, drainage divides in peneplain can follow more resistant rock. In the view of Davis large streams do became insensitive to lithology and structure, which they were not during the valley phase of erosion cycle. This may explain the existence of superimposed streams. 

==Types of peneplains==
There are various terms for landforms that are either alternatives to classical peneplains, a sub-set of peneplains or partially overlap with the term. The last is the case of planation surfaces that may be peneplains or not, while some peneplains are not planation surfaces.

In their 2013 work Green, Lidmar-Bergström and co-workers provide the following classification scheme for peneplains:
#Planation surfaces
##Pediplain
##Inselberg plain
##Etchplain
#Hilly relief
##Etched hilly relief

Rhodes Fairbridge and Charles Finkl argue that peneplains are often of mixed origin (polygenetic), as they may have been shaped by etchplanation during periods of humid climate and pediplanation during periods of arid and semi-arid climate. The long time spans under which some peneplains evolve ensures varied climatic influences. The same authors do also list marine abrasion and glacial erosion among processes that can contribute in shaping peneplains.

In addition, epigene peneplains can be distinguished from exhumed peneplains. Epigene peneplains are those that have never been buried or covered by sedimentary rock. Exhumed peneplains are those that are re-exposed after having been buried in sediments.

The oldest identifiable peneplain in a region is known as a primary peneplain. An example of a primary peneplain is the Sub-Cambrian peneplain in southern Sweden.

===Pediplains===
The peneplain concept is often juxtaposed to that of pediplain. However authors like Karna Lidmar-Bergström classify pediplains as a type of peneplain. On the contrary Lester Charles King held them as incompatible landforms arguing that peneplains do not exist. King wrote: 
:&quot;A peneplain in the Davisian sense, resulting from slope reduction and downwearing, does not exist in nature. It should be redefined as &quot;an imaginary landform.&quot;&quot; 
According to King the difference between pediplains and Davis’ peneplains is in the history and processes behind their formation, and less so in the final shape. A difference in form that may be present is that of residual hills, which in Davis’ peneplains are to have gentle slopes, while in pediplains they ought to have the same steepness as the slopes in the early stages of erosion leading to pediplanation. Given that the coalesced pediments of the pediplains form a series of very gentle concave slopes, a difference with Davis&#x27; understanding of peneplains may lie in the fact that his idealized peneplains had very gentle convex slopes instead. However, Davis&#x27; views on the subject are not fully clear. Contrary to this view Rhodes Fairbridge and Charles Finkl argue that the precise mechanism of formation (pediplanation, etc.) is irrelevant and that the term peneplain has been used and can be used in a purely descriptive manner. Further, alternation of processes with varying climate, relative sea level and biota make old surfaces unlikely to be of a single origin.

==Preservation and destruction of peneplains==

Peneplains that are detached from their base level are identified by either hosting an accumulation of sediments that buries it or by being in an uplifted position. Burial preserves the peneplain. Any exposed peneplain detached from its baselevel can be considered a paleosurface or paleoplain. Uplift of a peneplain commonly results in renewed erosion. As Davis put it in 1885:
:&quot;the decrepit surface must wait either until extinguished by submergence below the sea, or regenerated by elevation into a new cycle of life&quot;

Uplifted peneplains can be preserved as fossil landforms in conditions of extreme aridity or under non-eroding cold-based glacier ice. Erosion of peneplains by glaciers in shield regions is limited. In the Fennoscandian Shield average glacier erosion during the Quaternary amounts to tens of meters, albeit this was not evenly distributed. For glacier erosion to be effective in shields a long &quot;preparation period&quot; of weathering under non-glacial conditions may be a requirement.

Silicification of peneplain surfaces exposed to sub-tropical and tropical climate for long enough time can protect them from erosion.
