<text>Associated-Rediffusion, later Rediffusion London, was the British ITV franchise holder for London and parts of the surrounding counties, on weekdays between 22 September 1955 and 29 July 1968. It was the first ITA franchisee to go on air, and one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; companies that between them produced the majority of ITV networked programmes during this period.

Rediffusion lost its franchise in 1968 but merged with another franchisee to form Thames Television, which continued to hold the London weekday franchise for another 24 years.

==History==

===Formation===
Associated-Rediffusion Television was originally a partnership between British Electric Traction (BET), its subsidiary Broadcast Relay Services Ltd. (trading as Rediffusion), and Associated Newspapers, owner of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, which had been interested in commercial broadcasting as early as the 1920s. In the aftermath of the heavy financial losses made by the new ITV system in its initial years, Associated Newspapers sold the majority of its share to BET and Rediffusion, although the company did not drop the word &quot;Associated&quot; from its name until 1964. Associated Newspapers, later realising the potential of ITV, was a significant investor in the ITV franchise contractor for southern and south-east England, Southern Television and later on becoming a shareholder on Independent Television News.

Thomas Brownrigg, the general manager of Associated-Rediffusion from 1955, had a very clear idea of what his new commercial television station was to be like – the BBC Television Service, with advertisements. To this end, the station had a heraldic-style on-air clock, referred to as &quot;Mitch&quot; by staff (after chief station announcer Leslie Mitchell, who had not only made the first announcement when A-R went on the air in 1955, but had done the same when the BBC TV service started in 1936).

Associated-Rediffusion took over the former Wembley Film Studio at Wembley Park in Middlesex. Associated-Rediffusion officially began broadcasting on 22 September 1955 at 19:15, with actress Marjie Lawrence uttering the first words. That night the BBC, which had held the monopoly on broadcasting in the UK, aired a melodramatic episode of their popular radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; on the BBC Home Service in which core character Grace Archer was fatally injured in a fire. This was seen as a desperate, and rather underhand, ploy to lure as much of the potential audience as possible from tuning in to the new station&#x27;s opening night of broadcast entertainment. Britain&#x27;s first female newsreader Barbara Mandell appeared during the first full day of transmissions on 23 September 1955. The London weekend contractor ATV launched two days later.

This strategy was intended to allay fears that the new service would be aimed at the bottom of the market. Associated-Rediffusion sought to make ITV respectable. It did introduce popular game shows, but also provided quality programming across all genres gaining large audiences both in its own London area and, as the ITV network grew, for its programmes shown across the country.

Boris Ford became Associated-Rediffusion&#x27;s first head of schools broadcasting (1957–58), during which time he persuaded Benjamin Britten to compose his church opera &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; for a series of programmes. Ford was dismissed before the opera was produced, allegedly for administrative shortcomings and inexperience. However, A-R continued its association with Britten, producing a highly successful telecast of his opera &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; in 1959.

Associated-Rediffusion added new television studios at Wembley Park in 1960. Their size and unique design attracted worldwide attention. During the 1960s, the studios were home to some of the most popular programmes on the ITV network, including &quot;The Rat Catchers&quot;, &quot;Blackmail&quot;, &quot;At Last, The 1948 Show&quot; and &quot;The Frost Report&quot;. The Beatles appeared at the studios on more than one occasion.

===Rebranding and loss of franchise===
In 1964, the company simplified its name to Rediffusion Television and rebranded the station on screen as &quot;Rediffusion London&quot;, with a very hip 1960s style, the face of Swinging London in the shiny prosperous new Britain. However, the new Rediffusion did not survive for long – in October 1967 the Independent Television Authority announced to the company&#x27;s shock that there was no place for Rediffusion in the redrawn franchise pattern. Following changes to the ITV network structure, which resulted in the abandonment of the Midlands and North weekend franchises held by ABC Weekend TV, ABC lost all its franchises along with the rights to take over the Midlands, held by ATV, or the London weekend franchise, awarded to the London Television Consortium. To preserve the sizeable ABC, the ITA proposed ABC and Rediffusion should form a new company: Thames Television. This was not a merger or &quot;forced marriage&quot; as is commonly stated and is an urban myth. ABPC, the parent company of ABC, and BET, the parent company of Rediffusion, created Thames as a separate entity. Thames would use the resources and staff of ABC&#x27;s Teddington Studios and Rediffusion&#x27;s Television House. Rediffusion&#x27;s parent company, BET, took a 49% stake in Thames, and was under-represented in the management of the new company – a state of affairs to which Rediffusion strongly objected. The ITA replied that either Thames took the new contract, or ABC took over. Rediffusion chose the former and went off the air on 29 July 1968 at 12:26 am. Employees based at Wembley went to work for London Weekend Television whilst those at Television House were employed by Thames. Some managerial and presentation staff re-located to the new Yorkshire Television in Leeds.

Much of Rediffusion&#x27;s programme library was either lost or destroyed following the creation of Thames. Surviving titles from the Rediffusion archive are held by the BFI National Archive at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. Most titles are the intellectual property of Archbuild Limited, with the exception of some of Rediffusion&#x27;s musical output such as &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; which was for a long time owned by Dave Clark International, and latterly by BMG Rights Management. Some Rediffusion shows have been rediscovered in recent years. In the late 1980s, a series of five &quot;At Last the 1948 Show&quot; compilations was found in the archives of Swedish broadcaster, SVT. In 2020 The British Film Institute released the most complete box set possible of the restored series, including all ten surviving episodes, two almost completely reconstructed episodes, and the complete audio of a further episode with fragments of film.

===Revival===
In the 1990s, the name &quot;Associated-Rediffusion Television&quot; and the adastral trademark were acquired by British journalist Victor Lewis-Smith, and were used by his own production company. Productions included:

* &quot;TV Offal&quot;, a satirical series of TV archive clips presented by Lewis-Smith
* &quot;Ads Infinitum&quot;, a retrospective of vintage television advertising presented by Lewis-Smith over two series
* An &quot;Omnibus&quot; documentary covering Dudley Moore&#x27;s love for music and his struggle with progressive supranuclear palsy, titled &quot;Dudley Moore: After The Laughter&quot;. It turned out to be Moore&#x27;s final interview for television and won a BAFTA Television Award in 2001.
* A one-off revival of &quot;Dee Time&quot;
* A series of documentaries presented by actor Keith Allen
* &quot;21st Century Bach&quot;, a long-running series of programmes no more than ten minutes in length, each featuring short pieces of organ music by J.S. Bach and played by John Scott Whiteley
* &quot;Alchemists of Sound&quot;, a documentary about the BBC Radiophonic Workshop
* &quot;The Undiscovered Tony Hancock&quot;, a 2018 documentary for Sky Arts

===Reditune and Rediffusion Music===
Rediffusion Music, Reditune Rediffusion, Reditune Music and Rediffusion Thorsen (Germany) were sold to AEI Music Network of Seattle, WA in 1996. DMX Music, a smaller music provider, bought AEI Music in 2000. Mood Media bought DMX Music in 2005. The current owner remains Mood Media; however, it trades under the &quot;MOOD:&quot; brand today.
Mood Media Corporation own the previous trading names of Rediffusion Reditune, Rediffusion Music, AEI Rediffusion Music, AEI Music and DMX Music.

==Studios==
The company&#x27;s administrative headquarters and transmission facilities were at Television House in Kingsway, London. Most programmes were produced at Wembley Studios in Wembley Park, north-west London. However, a small basement studio at Television House, Studio 9, was occasionally used for current affairs programmes and was home to &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; during its first few years.

Television House had been known as Adastral House when it was the headquarters of the Air Ministry. This gave its name to A-R&#x27;s logo, the 16-point Adastral Star, which appeared not only at the start and end of each commercial break but also between each advertisement. (The motto of the Royal Air Force is &quot;per ardua, ad astra&quot; - &quot;through adversity to the stars&quot;.) The station&#x27;s archives were also kept at these properties, with the original programme library situated on the roof of Television House with some storage in the film vaults at Wembley Studios.

Following Rediffusion&#x27;s loss of franchise and the creation of Thames Television, the Wembley studios were leased to the newly formed London Weekend Television by order of the ITA, and the company officially took control of the premises on Monday 6 May 1968 for a contractual minimum term of three years. London Weekend Television subsequently vacated the studios in the late summer of 1972.

Somewhat confusingly, this Wembley studios site is the very same studio buildings site that would later be sold-off, renamed, re-purposed as film studios, then back to television studios, at various stages when used by later owners; London Weekend Television (Wembley), Lee International Studios (Wembley), Limehouse Television (Wembley), Fountain Television, before closing in 2018, and becoming a theatre space, prior to the site&#x27;s planned redevelopment from 2019.

Television House was used as Thames&#x27; headquarters until their Euston Road studios were built in 1970 and was subsequently sold off.

==Presentation==
When Rediffusion originally launched, as Associated-Rediffusion, presentation consisted of a simple animated ident, featuring the station name, and a spinning star called the Adastral. This first ident was accompanied by a five note electronic fanfare, achieved by tapping out the morse code for &#x27;A-R&#x27;. To accompany the ident, a timepiece was created based on a heraldic coat of arms and nicknamed &#x27;Mitch&#x27; after Head of Presentation Leslie Mitchell.

In 1964, Associated-Rediffusion rebranded itself on screen as Rediffusion London, using a black and grey ident featuring the same spinning star as previous, but with the new name now in a stripe and in a sans serif font. A new seven note strident theme was adopted to replace the original fanfare, and a new and simpler clock was designed featuring a 24-hour display at the bottom of the face and an adastral at the centre. The original timepiece &#x27;Mitch&#x27; was given to the Science Museum, where it became the first ITV exhibit, and now resides in the National Media Museum, Bradford.

Rediffusion used a number of continuity announcers throughout its 13 years on air, with Redvers Kyle and Muriel Young being the most recognised.

==Programmes==
Programmes produced by or for Associated-Rediffusion and Rediffusion include:
Most of the surviving archive is now held by Archbuild and it has never been officially confirmed exactly how large the surviving archive actually is.

<doc id="181145" wikidata="Q75216" url="?curid=181145" title="August Dillmann">
<text>Christian Friedrich August Dillmann (25 April 18237 July 1894) was a German orientalist and biblical scholar.

==Life==
The son of a Württemberg schoolmaster, he was born at Illingen. He was educated at the University of Tübingen, where he became a pupil and friend of Heinrich Ewald, and studied under Ferdinand Christian Baur, though he did not join the new Tübingen school. For a short time, he worked as pastor at Sersheim, near his native place, but he soon came to feel that his studies demanded his whole time.

He devoted himself to the study of Ethiopic manuscripts in the libraries of Paris, London and Oxford, and this work caused a revival of Ethiopic study in the 19th century. In 1847 and 1848, he prepared catalogues of the Ethiopic manuscripts in the British Museum (now the British Library) and the Bodleian Library at Oxford. He then set to work upon an edition of the Ethiopic Bible.

Returning to Tübingen in 1848, in 1853, he was appointed professor extraordinarius. Subsequently, he became professor of philosophy at the University of Kiel (1854), and of theology in Giessen (1864) and Berlin (1869), where he succeeded Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg.

==Works==
In 1851, he had published the &quot;Book of Enoch&quot; in Ethiopian (German, 1853; English, 1893), and at Kiel, he completed the first part of the Ethiopic bible, &quot;Octateuchus Aethiopicus&quot; (1853–55). In 1857 appeared his &quot;Grammatik der äthiopischen Sprache&quot; (2nd edition by Carl Bezold, 1899); in 1859 the &quot;Book of Jubilees&quot;; in 1861 and 1871 another part of the Ethiopic bible, &quot;Libri Regum&quot;; in 1865 his great &quot;Lexicon linguæ aethiopicæ&quot;; in 1866 his &quot;Chrestomathia aethiopica&quot;. In 1853, Dillmann published an article comparing Ethiopian king lists.

Always a theologian at heart, he returned to theology in 1864. His Giessen lectures were published under the titles, &quot;Ursprung der alttestamentlichen Religion&quot; (1865) and &quot;Die Propheten des alten Bundes nach ihrer politischen Wirksamkeit&quot; (1868). In 1869 appeared his commentary on &quot;Hiob&quot;, (4th edition 1891) which stamped him as one of the foremost Old Testament exegetes.

His renown as a theologian was mainly founded on the series of commentaries, based on those of August Wilhelm Knobel&#x27;s &quot;Die Genesis&quot; (Leipzig, 1875); &quot;Die Bücher Exodus und Leviticus&quot;, 1880; &quot;Die Bücher Numeri, Deuteronomium und Josua&quot;, with a dissertation on the origin of the Hexateuch, 1886; &quot;Der Prophet Jesaja&quot;, 1890. In 1877 he published the &quot;Ascension of Isaiah&quot; in Ethiopian and Latin. He was also a contributor to Daniel Schenkel&#x27;s &quot;Bibellexikon&quot;, Brockhaus&#x27;s &quot;Conversationslexikon&quot;, and Johann Jakob Herzog&#x27;s &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;. His book on Old Testament theology, &quot;Handbuch der alttestamentlichen Theologie&quot;, was published by Rudolf Kittel in 1895.

<text>An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft.

Fighter aircraft often carry out the attack role, although they would not be considered attack aircraft &quot;per se&quot;; fighter-bomber conversions of those same aircraft would be considered part of the class. Strike fighters, which have effectively replaced the fighter-bomber and light bomber concepts, also differ little from the broad concept of an attack aircraft.

The dedicated attack aircraft as a separate class existed primarily during and after World War II. The precise implementation varied from country to country, and was handled by a wide variety of designs. In the United States and Britain, attack aircraft were generally light bombers or medium bombers, sometimes carrying heavier forward-firing weapons like the North American B-25G Mitchell and de Havilland Mosquito Tsetse. In Germany and the USSR, where they were known as &quot;Schlachtflugzeug&quot; (&quot;battle aircraft&quot;) or &quot;sturmovik&quot; (&quot;storm trooper&quot;) respectively, this role was carried out by purpose-designed and heavily armored aircraft such as the Henschel Hs 129 and Ilyushin Il-2. The Germans and Soviets also used light bombers in this role: cannon-armed versions of the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka greatly outnumbered the Hs 129, while the Petlyakov Pe-2 was used for this role in spite of not being specifically designed for it.

In the latter part of World War II, the fighter-bomber began to take over many attack roles, a transition that continued in the post-war era. Jet-powered examples were relatively rare but not unknown, such as the Blackburn Buccaneer. The U.S. Navy continued to introduce new aircraft in their A-series, but these were mostly similar to light and medium bombers. The need for a separate attack aircraft category was greatly diminished by the introduction of precision-guided munitions which allowed almost any aircraft to carry out this role while remaining safe at high altitude. Attack helicopters also have overtaken many remaining roles that could only be carried out at lower altitudes.

Since the 1960s, only two dedicated attack aircraft designs have been widely introduced, the American Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the Soviet/Russian Sukhoi Su-25 Frogfoot.

A variety of light attack aircraft has also been introduced in the post-World War II era, usually based on adapted trainers or other light fixed-wing aircraft. These have been used in counter-insurgency operations.

== Definition and designations ==

=== United States definition and designations ===

U.S. attack aircraft are currently identified by the prefix A-, as in &quot;A-6 Intruder&quot; and &quot;A-10 Thunderbolt II&quot;. However, until the end of World War II the &quot;A-&quot; designation was shared between attack planes and light bombers for USAAF aircraft (as opposed to &quot;B-&quot; prefix for medium or heavy bombers). The US Navy used a separate designation system and at the time preferred to call similar aircraft scout bombers (SB) or torpedo bombers (TB or BT). For example, Douglas SBD Dauntless scout bomber was designated A-24 when used by the USAAF. It was not until 1946, when the US Navy and US Marine Corps started using the &quot;attack&quot; (A) designation, when it renamed BT2D Skyraider and BTM Mauler to, respectively, AD Skyraider and AM Mauler.

As with many aircraft classifications, the definition of &quot;attack aircraft&quot; is somewhat vague and has tended to change over time. Current U.S. military doctrine defines it as an aircraft which most likely performs an &quot;attack mission&quot;, more than any other kind of mission. &quot;Attack mission&quot; means, in turn, specifically tactical air-to-ground action—in other words, neither air-to-air action nor strategic bombing is considered an &quot;attack mission&quot;. In United States Navy vocabulary, the alternative designation for the same activity is a &quot;strike mission&quot;. Attack missions are principally divided into two categories: air interdiction and close air support. In the last several decades, the rise of the ubiquitous multi-role fighter has created some confusion about the difference between attack and fighter aircraft. According to the current U.S. designation system, an attack aircraft (&quot;A&quot;) is designed primarily for air-to-surface (Attack: Aircraft designed to find, attack, and destroy land or sea targets) missions (also known as &quot;attack missions&quot;), while a fighter category &quot;F&quot; incorporates not only aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat, but additionally multipurpose aircraft designed also for ground-attack missions. &quot;F&quot; - Fighter Aircraft were designed to intercept and destroy other aircraft or missiles. This includes multipurpose aircraft also designed for ground support missions such as interdiction and close air support. Just to mention one example amongst many, the F-111 &quot;Aardvark&quot; was designated &quot;F&quot; despite having only minimal air-to-air capabilities. Only a single aircraft in the USAF&#x27;s current inventory bears a simple, unmixed &quot;A&quot; designation: the A-10 Thunderbolt II.

=== Other designations ===

British designations have included FB for fighter-bomber and more recently &quot;G&quot; for &quot;Ground-attack&quot; as in Harrier GR1 (meaning &quot;Ground-attack/Reconnaissance, Mark 1&quot;).

Imperial Japanese Navy designation use &quot;B&quot; to designate carrier attack bomber such as the Nakajima B5N Type-97 bomber although these aircraft are mostly used for torpedo attack and level bombing. They also use &quot;D&quot; to specifically designate carrier dive bomber like the Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot;&quot;.&quot; However by the end of the world war II, the IJN introduced the Aichi B7A &quot;Ryusei&quot; which could performed both torpedo bombing and dive bombing rendering the &quot;D&quot; designation redundant.

The NATO reporting names for Soviet/Russian ground-attack aircraft at first started with &quot;B&quot; categorizing them as bombers, as in case of Il-10 &#x27;Beast&#x27;. But later they were usually classified as fighters (&quot;F&quot;)—possibly because (since Sukhoi Su-7) they were similar in size and visual appearance to Soviet fighters, or were simply derivatives of such.

In the PLAAF, ground-attack aircraft are given the designation &quot;Q&quot;. So far this has only been given to the Nanchang Q-5.

== History ==
=== World War I ===

The attack aircraft as a role was defined by its use during World War I, in support of ground forces on battlefields. Battlefield support is generally divided into close air support and battlefield air interdiction, the first requiring strict and the latter only general cooperation with friendly surface forces. Such aircraft also attacked targets in rear areas. Such missions required flying where light anti-aircraft fire was expected and operating at low altitudes to precisely identify targets. Other roles, including those of light bombers, medium bombers, dive bombers, reconnaissance, fighters, fighter-bombers, could and did perform air strikes on battlefields. All these types could significantly damage ground targets from a low level flight, either by bombing, machine guns, or both.

Attack aircraft came to diverge from bombers and fighters. While bombers could be used on a battlefield, their slower speeds made them extremely vulnerable to ground fire, as did the lighter construction of fighters. The survivability of attack aircraft was guaranteed by their speed/power, protection (i.e. armor panels) and strength of construction;

Germany was the first country to produce dedicated ground-attack aircraft (designated CL-class and J-class). They were put into use in autumn 1917, during World War I. Most notable was the Junkers J.I, which pioneered the idea of an armored &quot;bathtub&quot;, that was both fuselage structure and protection for engine and crew. The British experimented with the Sopwith TF series (termed &quot;trench fighters&quot;), although these did not see combat.

The last battles of 1918 on the Western Front demonstrated that ground-attacking aircraft were a valuable component of all-arms tactics. Close support ground strafing (machine-gunning) and tactical bombing of infantry (especially when moving between trenches and along roads), machine gun posts, artillery, and supply formations was a part of the Allied armies&#x27; strength in holding German attacks and supporting Allied counter-attacks and offensives. Admittedly, the cost to the Allies was high, with the Royal Flying Corps sustaining a loss rate approaching 30% among ground-attack aircraft.

=== 1919–1939 ===


After World War I, it was widely believed that using aircraft against tactical targets was of little use other than in harassing and undermining enemy morale; attacking combatants was generally much more dangerous to aircrews than their targets, a problem that was continually becoming more acute with the ongoing refinement of anti-aircraft weapons. Within the range of types serving attack roles, dive bombers were increasingly being seen as more effective than aircraft designed for strafing with machine guns or cannons.

Nevertheless, during the 1920s, the US military, in particular, procured specialized &quot;Attack&quot; aircraft and formed dedicated units, that were trained primarily for that role. The US Army Engineering Division became involved in designing ground attack aircraft. The 1920 Boeing GA-1 was an armored twin-engine triplane for ground strafing with eight machine guns and about a ton of armor plate, and the 1922 Aeromarine PG-1 was a combined pursuit (fighter) and ground attack design with a 37mm gun. The United States Marine Corps Aviation applied close air support tactics in the Banana Wars. While they did not pioneer dive bombing tactics, Marine aviators were the first to include it in their doctrine during the United States occupation of Haiti and Nicaragua. The United States Army Air Corps was notable for its creation of a separate &quot;A-&quot; designation for attack types, distinct from and alongside &quot;B-&quot; for bomber types and &quot;P-&quot; for pursuit (later replaced by &quot;F-&quot; for fighter) aircraft. The first designated attack type to be operational with the USAAC was the Curtiss A-2 Falcon. Nevertheless, such aircraft, including the A-2&#x27;s replacement, the Curtiss A-12 Shrike, were unarmored and highly vulnerable to AA fire.

The British Royal Air Force focused primarily on strategic bombing, rather than ground attack. However, like most air arms of the period it did operate attack aircraft, named Army Cooperation in RAF parlance, which included the Hawker Hector, Westland Lysander and others.
Aviation played a role in the Brazilian Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, although both sides had few aircraft. The federal government had approximately 58 aircraft divided between the Navy and the Army, as the Air Force at this time did not constitute an independent branch. In contrast, the rebels had only two Potez 25 planes and two Waco CSO, plus a small number of private aircraft.

During the 1930s, Nazi Germany had begun to field a class of &quot;Schlacht&quot; (&quot;battle&quot;) aircraft, such as the Henschel Hs 123. Moreover, the experiences of German Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War, against an enemy with few fighter aircraft, changed ideas about ground attack. Though equipped with generally unsuitable designs such as the Henschel Hs 123 and cannon-armed versions of the Heinkel He 112, their armament and pilots proved that aircraft were a very effective weapon, even without bombs. This led to some support within the Luftwaffe for the creation of an aircraft dedicated to this role, resulting in tenders for a new &quot;attack aircraft&quot;. This led to the introduction (in 1942) of a unique single-seat, twin-engine attack aircraft, the slow-moving but heavily armored and formidably armed Henschel Hs 129 &quot;Panzerknacker&quot; (&quot;Safecracker&quot; /&quot;Tank Cracker&quot;).

In Japan, the Imperial Japanese Navy had developed the Aichi D3A dive bomber (based on the Heinkel He 70) and the Mitsubishi B5M light attack bomber. Both, like their US counterparts, were lightly armored types, and were critically reliant on surprise attacks and the absence of significant fighter or AA opposition.

During the Winter War, the Soviet Air Forces used the Polikarpov R-5SSS, and Polikarpov R-ZSh, as attack aircraft.

Perhaps the most notable attack type to emerge during the late 1930s was the Soviet Ilyushin Il-2 &quot;Sturmovik&quot;, which became the most-produced military aircraft type in history.

As World War II approached, the concept of an attack aircraft was not well defined, and various air services used many different names for widely differing types, all performing similar roles (sometimes in tandem with non-attack roles of bombers, fighters, reconnaissance and other roles.

; Army co-operation

The British concept of a light aircraft mixing all the roles that required extensive communication with land forces: reconnaissance, liaison, artillery spotting, aerial supply, and, last but not least, occasional strikes on the battlefield. The concept was similar to front-line aircraft used in the World War I, which was called the CL class in the German Empire. Eventually the RAF&#x27;s experience showed types such as Westland Lysander to be unacceptably vulnerable and it was replaced by faster fighter types for photo-reconnaissance, and light aircraft for artillery spotting.

; Light bomber

During the inter-war period, the British flew the Fairey Battle, a light bomber which originated in a 1932 specification. Designs in 1938 for a replacement were adapted as a target tug. The last British specification issued for a light bomber was B.20/40 described as a &quot;Close Army Support Bomber&quot; capable of dive bombing and photo-reconnaissance. However, the specification was dropped before an aircraft went into production.

; Dive bomber

In some air services, dive bombers did not equip ground-attack units, but were treated as a separate class. In Nazi Germany, the Luftwaffe distinguished between the &quot;Stuka&quot; (&quot;Sturzkampf-&quot;, &quot;dive bombing&quot;) units, equipped with Junkers Ju 87 from &quot;Schlacht&quot; (&quot;battle&quot;) units, using strafing/low-level bombing types such as the Henschel Hs 123).

; Fighter-bomber

Although not a synonymous class with ground-attack aircraft, fighter-bombers were usually used for the role, and proved to excel at it, even when they were only lightly armored. The Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces relegated obsolescent fighters to this role, while cutting-edge fighters would serve as interceptors and establish air superiority.

The United States Navy, in distinction to the USAAF, preferred the older term &quot;Scout-Bomber&quot;, under a &quot;SB-&quot; designation, such as the Curtiss SB2C Helldiver.

=== World War II ===

The Junkers Ju 87s of the German Luftwaffe became virtually synonymous with close air support during the early months of World War II. The British Commonwealth&#x27;s Desert Air Force, led by Arthur Tedder, became the first Allied tactical formation to emphasize the attack role, usually in the form of single-engine Hawker Hurricane and Curtiss P-40 fighter-bombers or specialized &quot;tank-busters&quot;, such as the Hurricane Mk IID, armed with two 40 mm Vickers S guns (notably No. 6 Squadron RAF).
At around the same time, a massive invasion by Axis forces had forced the Soviet air forces to quickly expand their army support capacity, such as the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik. The women pilots known as the &quot;Night Witches&quot; utilised an obsolescent, wooden light trainer biplane type, the Polikarpov Po-2 and small anti-personnel bombs in &quot;harassment bombing&quot; attacks that proved difficult to counter.

Wartime experience showed that poorly armored and/or lightly built, pre-war types were unacceptably vulnerable, especially to fighters. Nevertheless, skilled crews could be highly successful in those types, such as the leading &quot;Stuka&quot; ace, Hans-Ulrich Rudel, who claimed 500 tanks, a battleship, a cruiser, and two destroyers in 2,300 combat missions.

The Bristol Beaufighter, based on an obsolescent RAF bomber, became a versatile twin-engine attack aircraft and served in almost every theatre of the war, in the maritime strike and ground attack roles as well as that of night fighter.

Conversely, some mid-war attack types emerged as adaptations of fighters, including several versions of the German Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the British Hawker Typhoon and the US Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. The Typhoon, which was disappointing as a fighter, due to poor high altitude performance, was very fast at low altitudes and thus became the RAF&#x27;s premier ground attack fighter. It was armed with four 20mm cannon, augmented first with bombs, then rockets. Likewise the P-47 was designed and intended for use as a high altitude bomber escort, but gradually found that role filled by the North American P-51 Mustang (because of its much longer range and greater maneuverability). The P-47 was also heavier and more robust than the P-51 and regarded therefore, as an &quot;energy fighter&quot;: ideal for high-speed dive-and-climb tactics, including strafing attacks. Its armament of eight 0.50 caliber machine guns was effective against Axis infantry and light vehicles in both Europe and the Pacific.

While machine guns and cannon were initially sufficient, the evolution of well-armored tanks required heavier weapons. To augment bombs, high explosive rockets were introduced, although these unguided projectiles were still &quot;barely adequate&quot; because of their inaccuracy. For the British RP3, one hit per sortie was considered acceptable. However, even a near miss with rockets could cause damage or injuries to &quot;soft targets,&quot; and patrols by Allied rocket-armed aircraft over Normandy disrupted or even completely paralyzed German road traffic. They also affected morale, because even the prospect of a rocket attack was unnerving.

The ultimate development of the cannon-armed light attack aircraft was the small production run in 1944 of the Henschel Hs 129B-3, armed with a modified PAK 40 75 mm anti-tank gun. This weapon, the &quot;Bordkanone BK 7,5&quot;, was the most powerful forward-firing weapon fitted to a production military aircraft during World War II. The only other aircraft to be factory-equipped with similar guns were the 1,420 maritime strike variants of the North American B-25 MitchellG/H, which mounted either a M4 cannon, or light-weight T13E1 or M5 versions of the same gun. These weapons, however, were hand-loaded, had shorter barrels and/or a lower muzzle velocity than the BK 7,5 and, therefore, poorer armor penetration, accuracy and rate of fire. (Except for versions of the Piaggio P.108 armed with a 102mm anti-ship cannon, The BK 7,5 was unsurpassed as an aircraft-fitted gun until 1971, when the four-engine Lockheed AC-130E Spectre; equipped with a 105 mm M102 howitzer, entered service with the US Air Force.)

=== Post-World War II ===
In the immediate post war era the piston-engined ground-attack aircraft remained useful since all of the early jets lacked endurance due to the fuel consumption rates of the jet engines. The higher powered piston engine types that had been too late for World War II were still capable of holding their own against the jets as they were able to both out accelerate and out maneuver the jets. The Royal Navy Hawker Sea Fury fighters and the U.S. Vought F4U Corsair and Douglas A-1 Skyraider were operated during the Korean War while the latter continued to be used throughout the Vietnam War.

Many post-World War II era air forces have been reluctant to adopt fixed-wing jet aircraft developed specifically for ground attack. Although close air support and interdiction remain crucial to the modern battlefield, attack aircraft are less glamorous than fighters, while air force pilots and military planners have a certain well-cultivated contempt for &quot;mud-movers&quot;. More practically, the cost of operating a specialized ground-attack aircraft is harder to justify when compared with multirole combat aircraft. Jet attack aircraft were designed and employed during the Cold War era, such as the carrier-based nuclear strike Douglas A-3 Skywarrior and North American A-5 Vigilante, while the Grumman A-6 Intruder, F-105 Thunderchief, F-111, F-117 Nighthawk, LTV A-7 Corsair II, Sukhoi Su-25, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Panavia Tornado, AMX, Dassault Étendard, Super Étendard and others were designed specifically for ground-attack, strike, close support and anti-armor work, with little or no air-to-air capability.

Ground attack has increasingly become a task of converted trainers, like the BAE Systems Hawk or Aero L-39 Albatros, and many trainers are built with this task in mind, like the CASA C-101 or the Aermacchi MB-339. Such counter-insurgency aircraft are popular with air forces which cannot afford to purchase more expensive multirole aircraft, or do not wish to risk the few such aircraft they have on light ground attack missions. A proliferation of low intensity conflicts in the post-World War II era has also expanded need for these types of aircraft to conduct counter-insurgency and light ground attack operations.

A primary distinction of post-World War II aviation between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Air Force was that latter had generally been allocated all fixed-wing aircraft, while helicopters were under control of the former; this was governed by the 1948 Key West Agreement. The Army, wishing to have its own resources to support its troops in combat and faced with a lack of Air Force enthusiasm for the ground-attack role, developed the dedicated attack helicopter.

=== Recent history ===

On 17 January 1991, Task Force Normandy began its attack on two Iraqi anti-aircraft missile sites. TF Normandy, under the command of LTC Richard A. &quot;Dick&quot; Cody, consisted of nine AH-64 Apaches, one UH-60 Black Hawk and four Air Force MH-53J Pave Low helicopters. The purpose of this mission was to create a safe corridor through the Iraqi air defense system. The attack was a huge success and cleared the way for the beginning of the Allied bombing campaign of Operation Desert Storm.

One concern involving the Apache arose when a unit of these helicopters was very slow to deploy during U.S. military involvement in Kosovo. According to the &quot;Army Times&quot;, the Army is shifting its doctrine to favor ground-attack aircraft over attack helicopters for deep strike attack missions because ground-attack helicopters have proved to be highly vulnerable to small-arms fire; the U.S. Marine Corps has noted similar problems.

In the late 1960s the United States Air Force requested a dedicated close air support (CAS) plane that became the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The A-10 was originally conceived as an anti-armor weapon (the A-X program requirements specifically called for an aircraft mounting a large rotary cannon to destroy massed Warsaw Pact armored forces) with limited secondary capability in the interdiction and tactical bombing roles. Today it remains the only dedicated fixed-wing ground-attack aircraft in any U.S. military service. Overall U.S. experience in the Gulf War, Kosovo War, Afghanistan War, and Iraq War has resulted in renewed interest in such aircraft. The U.S. Air Force is currently researching a replacement for the A-10 and started the OA-X program to procure a light attack aircraft.
The Soviets&#x27; similar Sukhoi Su-25 (&quot;Frogfoot&quot;) found success in the &quot;flying artillery&quot; role with many air forces.
The UK has completely retired the BAE Harrier II in 2011, and the Panavia Tornado dedicated attack-reconnaissance aircraft in 2019. It obtained the F-35 in 2018 and it retains its fleet of Eurofighter Typhoon multirole fighters.

<text>Theodor Nöldeke (; born 2 March 1836 – 25 December 1930) was a German orientalist and scholar, originally a student of Heinrich Ewald. He is one of the founders of the field of Quranic studies, especially through his foundational work titled the &quot;Geschichte des Qorāns&quot; (&quot;History of the Quran&quot;)&quot;.&quot; His research interests also ranged over Old Testament studies, and his command of Semitic languages ranging across Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, Syriac, and Ethiopic allowed him to write hundreds of studies across a wide range of Oriental topics, including a number of translations, grammars, and works on literatures found in various languages.

Among the projects Nöldeke collaborated on was Michael Jan de Goeje’s published edition of al-Tabari&#x27;s &quot;Tarikh&quot; (&quot;Universal History&quot;), for which he translated the Sassanid-era section. This translation remains of great value, particularly for the extensive supplementary commentary.
His numerous students included Charles Cutler Torrey, Louis Ginzberg and Friedrich Zacharias Schwally. He entrusted Schwally with the continuation of his standard work &quot;The History of the Qur’ān&quot;.

==Biography==
Nöldeke was born in Harburg, (Hamburg today). In 1853 he graduated from the Gymnasium Georgianum Lingen, Emsland, and went on to study at the University of Göttingen under Heinrich Ewald, and later at the University of Vienna, the University of Leiden and the Humboldt University of Berlin.

In 1864 he became a professor at the University of Kiel and from 1872 at the University of Strasbourg until he retired aged 70. Many of his students became prominent researchers in their own right, including Eduard Sachau, Carl Brockelmann, Christiaan Snouck-Hurgronje, Edward Denison Ross, and Charles Cutler Torrey.

Nöldeke had ten children, six of whom predeceased him. His son Arnold Nöldeke became a judge and was a Hamburg senator during the Weimar period.

He died in Karlsruhe in 1930.

== Research ==

=== &quot;Geschichte des Qorâns&quot; ===
Noldeke&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte&quot; emerged out of the dissertation that he had begun writing during his university studies, which was completed in 1856 and titled &quot;De origine et compositione surarum qoranicarum ipsiusque Qorani&quot;. Compared to earlier works studying the Quran by Western writers, Nöldeke uncoupled the study of the text from inquiries into the life of Muhammad and, unlike predecessors of his such as William Muir, did not have a missionary zeal. Instead, Nöldeke studied the Quran for its own sake. One of the most important aspects of Nöldeke&#x27;s argument was his periodisation of the Quranic surahs into a tripartite Meccan phase followed by a Medinan phase (an idea already conceived by his predecessor, Gustav Weil). In this, Nöldeke, though he did not follow the traditional chronological division of surahs exactly, did follow it in some detail. At the same time, Nöldeke also considered his division to be malleable and tentative to a degree as opposed to absolute and deciding.

Though Nöldeke&#x27;s work has been followed closely by some and rejected by others, it has been so influential that at least one scholar has referred to his work as &quot;the rock of our church&quot;. In 2013, a complete translation of the volume into English was published.

=== Chronology of the Quran ===
The Nöldeke Chronology is a &quot;canonical ordering&quot; of the 114 surahs of the Qur&#x27;an according to the sequence of revelation. Intended to aid theological, literary, and historical scholarship of Qur&#x27;anic exegesis by enhancing structural coherence. The Nöldeke Chronology has been adopted for general guidance by some schools of current scholarship. Nöldeke considered the surahs from the perspective of content and stylistic development and linguistic origination to rearrange them in historical sequence of revelation. According to his system Sura 21: “The Prophets,” – 21st of 114 surahs in the Qur&#x27;an – is renumbered &#x27;65&#x27;. His chronology further divided the surahs into two periods: The Meccan (in three phases), and the Medina.

The Nöldeke Chronology of the Qur&#x27;an: Four groups of the 114 Surahs:
*Group 1. First Meccan Period (48 Surahs): Surahs 96; 74; 111; 106; 108; 104; 107; 102; 105; 92; 90; 94; 93; 97; 86; 91; 80; 68; 87; 95; 103; 85; 73; 101; 99; 82; 81; 53; 84; 100; 79; 77; 78; 88; 89; 75; 83; 69; 51; 52; 56; 70; 55; 112; 109; 113; 114; 1
*Group 2. Second Meccan Period (21 Surahs): 54; 37; 71; 76; 44; 50; 20; 26; 15; 19; 38; 36; 43; 72; 67; 23; 21; 25; 17; 27; 18
*Group 3. Third Meccan Period (21 Surahs): 32; 41; 45; 16; 30; 11; 14; 12; 40; 28; 39; 29; 31; 42; 10; 34; 35; 7; 46; 6; 13
*Group 4. Medinan Period (24 Surahs): 2; 98; 64; 62; 8; 47; 3; 61; 57; 4; 65; 59; 33; 63; 24; 58; 22; 48; 66; 60; 110; 49; 9; 5

=== Mandaeism ===
In 1875, near the very beginning of the academic study of the religion of Mandaeism, Nöldeke published the &quot;Mandäische grammatik&quot;, a monumental work of Mandaean grammar that was of such philological depth that it remains the standard work on the subject to this day. It was also the basis of the subsequent &quot;Mandaic Dictionary&quot; by E. S. Drower.

=== Alexander the Great ===
In 1890, Nöldeke initiated the study of Alexander legends in the Arabic tradition with the publication of his &quot;Beiträge zur geschichte des Alexanderromans&quot;.

<text>The New Model Army or New Modelled Army was a standing army formed in 1645 by the Parliamentarians during the First English Civil War, then disbanded after the Stuart Restoration in 1660. It differed from other armies employed in the 1639 to 1653 Wars of the Three Kingdoms in that members were liable for service anywhere in the country, rather than being limited to a single area or garrison. To establish a professional officer corps, the army&#x27;s leaders were prohibited from having seats in either the House of Lords or House of Commons. This was to encourage their separation from the political or religious factions among the Parliamentarians.

The New Model Army was raised partly from among veteran soldiers who already had deeply held Puritan religious beliefs, and partly from conscripts who brought with them many commonly held beliefs about religion or society. Many of its common soldiers therefore held dissenting or radical views unique among English armies. Although the Army&#x27;s senior officers did not share many of their soldiers&#x27; political opinions, their independence from Parliament led to the Army&#x27;s willingness to contribute to both Parliament&#x27;s authority and to overthrow the Crown, and to establish a Commonwealth of England from 1649 to 1660, which included a period of direct military rule.

==Foundation==
The forces raised in 1642 by both Royalists and Parliamentarians were based on part-time militia known as Trained bands. Founded in 1572, these were organised by county, controlled by Lord-lieutenants appointed by the king, and constituted the only permanent military force in the country. The muster roll of February 1638 shows wide variations in size, equipment and training; the largest and best trained were based in London with 8,000, later increased to 20,000. When the First English Civil War began in August 1642, many of the largest militia were based in Parliamentarian areas like London, while Royalist counties like Shropshire or Glamorgan had fewer than 500 men.

The weakness of this system was the reluctance of locally raised troops to serve outside their &quot;home&quot; areas, a problem for both sides during the war. On 19 November 1644, the Parliamentarian Eastern Association announced that they could no longer meet the cost of maintaining their forces, which then comprised about half the field force available to Parliament. In response, the Committee of Both Kingdoms conducted a wide-ranging review of further military needs and recommended the establishment of a centralised, professional force. On 30 January 1645, committeemen of the Eastern Association discussed their concerns at the Bury Conference at Bury St Edmunds. On 17 February 1645, the New Model Army Ordinance became law, with Sir Thomas Fairfax being appointed Captain General, or commander in chief, and Philip Skippon being appointed Major General of the Foot.

The review coincided with increasing dissatisfaction as to the conduct of certain senior commanders; in July 1644, a Parliamentarian force under Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell secured control of Northern England by victory at Marston Moor. However, this was offset first by defeat at Lostwithiel in September, then lack of decisiveness at the Second Battle of Newbury in October. The two commanders involved, Essex and Manchester, were accused by many in Parliament of lacking commitment, a group that included moderates like Sir William Waller as well as radicals like Cromwell.

In December 1644, Sir Henry Vane introduced the Self-denying Ordinance, requiring those holding military commissions to resign from Parliament. As members of the House of Lords, Manchester and Essex were automatically removed, since unlike MPs they could not resign their titles, although they could be re-appointed, &#x27;if Parliament approved.&#x27; Although delayed by the Lords, the Ordinance came into force on 3 April 1645. Since Cromwell was MP for Cambridge, command of the cavalry was initially given to Colonel Bartholomew Vermuyden, a former officer in the Eastern Association who was of Dutch origin and wanted to return home. Fairfax asked that Cromwell be appointed Lieutenant General of the Horse in place of Vermuyden, making him one of two original exceptions to the Self-denying Ordinance, the other being Sir William Brereton, commander in Cheshire. They were allowed to serve under a series of three-month temporary commissions that were continually extended.

Other Parliamentarian forces were consolidated into two regional armies, the &quot;Northern Association&quot; under Sydnam Poyntz and &quot;Western Association&quot; under Edward Massey.

===Establishment and character===
Parliament authorised an Army of 22,000 soldiers, most of whom came from three existing Parliamentarian armies; that commanded by the Earl of Essex, Waller&#x27;s Southern Association and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester. It comprised 6,600 cavalry, divided into eleven units of 600 men, 14,400 foot, comprising twelve regiments of 1,200 men, and 1,000 dragoons. Originally each regiment of cavalry had a company of dragoons attached, but at the urging of Fairfax on 1 March they were formed into a separate unit commanded by Colonel John Okey. Although the cavalry regiments were already up to strength, the infantry was severely understrength and in May 1645 was still 4,000 men below the approved level.

By creating fewer but larger regiments, the re-organisation greatly reduced the requirement for officers and senior NCOs. Fairfax had more than double the number of officers available for his 200 vacancies and those deemed surplus to requirements were either discharged or persuaded to re-enlist at a lower rank. Essex and Manchester raised objections to around 30% of those on the list, for reasons that are still debated, but ultimately only five changes were approved. In addition, several Scots officers refused to take up their appointments, including John Middleton, originally colonel of the Second Regiment of Horse.

The standard daily pay was 8 pence for infantry and 2 shillings for cavalry, who also had to supply their own horses, while the administration of the Army was more centralised, with improved provision of adequate food, clothing and other supplies. At the same time, recruits were also supposed to be motivated by religious fervour, as demonstrated in the &quot;Soldier&#x27;s catechism&quot;, written by Robert Ram. On 9 June 1645, Sir Samuel Luke, one of the officers discharged, wrote the Army was &quot;the bravest for bodies of men, horse and arms so far as the common soldiers as ever I saw in my life&quot;. However, he later complained many soldiers were drunk and their officers were often indistinguishable from enlisted men.

The extent to which the Army can be seen as a hotbed of religious and political radicalism is disputed, particularly since many of those now viewed as radicals, like Thomas Horton or Thomas Pride, were not considered such at the time. It is generally agreed that Fairfax, himself a moderate Presbyterian, sought to achieve a balance, while Essex and Manchester tried to remove those they viewed as unsuitable. What is debated is whether they did so for military reasons, favouring the retention of established officer cadres, or to eliminate personal enemies and those considered too radical. Ultimately they failed and Fairfax successfully achieved his objective.

===Name===
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; dated the earliest use of the phrase &quot;New Model Army&quot; to the works of the Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle in 1845, and the exact term does not appear in 17th- or 18th-century documents. Records from February 1646 refer to the &quot;New Modelled Army&quot;—the idiom of the time being to refer to an army that was &quot;new-modelled&quot; rather than appending the word &quot;army&quot; to &quot;new model&quot;.

===Original order of battle===
The order of battle was as follows:


==Dress, equipment and tactics==

===Horse===

The New Model Army&#x27;s elite troops were its Regiments of Horse. They were armed and equipped in the style known at the time as harquebusiers, rather than as heavily armoured cuirassiers. They wore a back-and-front breastplate over a buff leather coat, which itself gave some protection against sword cuts, and normally a lobster-tailed pot helmet with a movable three-barred visor.

Regiments were organised into six troops, of one hundred troopers plus officers, non-commissioned officers and specialists (drummers, farriers etc.). Each troop had its own standard, square. On the battlefield, a regiment was normally formed as two &quot;divisions&quot; of three troops, one commanded by the regiment&#x27;s colonel (or the major, if the colonel was not present), the other by the lieutenant colonel.

Their discipline was markedly superior to that of their Royalist counterparts. Cromwell specifically forbade his men to gallop after a fleeing enemy, but demanded they hold the battlefield. This meant that the New Model cavalry could charge, break an enemy force, regroup and charge again at another objective. On the other hand, when required to pursue, they did so relentlessly, not breaking ranks to loot abandoned enemy baggage as Royalist horse often did.

===Dragoons===
The New Model Army contained one regiment of dragoons of twelve companies, each of one hundred men, under Colonel John Okey. Dragoons were mounted infantry, and wore much the same uniform as musketeers although they probably wore stout cloth gaiters to protect the legs while they rode. They were armed with flintlock &quot;snaphaunces&quot;.

On the battlefield, their major function was to clear enemy musketeers from in front of their main position. At the Battle of Naseby, they were used to outflank enemy cavalry.

In 1650, Okey&#x27;s dragoons were converted into a regiment of horse. It appears that after that date, unregimented companies of dragoons raised from the Militia and other sources were attached to the regiments of horse and foot as required. This was the case at the Battle of Dunbar on 3 September 1650.

===Foot===

The Regiments of Foot consisted of ten companies, in which musketeers and pikemen were mixed, at least on the march. Seven companies consisted of one hundred soldiers, plus officers, specialists and so on, and were commanded by captains. The other three companies were nominally commanded by the regiment&#x27;s colonel, lieutenant colonel and major, and were stronger (200, 160 and 140 ordinary soldiers respectively).

The regiments of foot were provided with red coats. Red was chosen because uniforms were purchased competitively from the lowest bidder, and Venetian red was the least expensive dye. Those used by the various regiments were distinguished by differently coloured linings, which showed at the collar and ends of the sleeves, and generally matched the colours of the regimental and company standards. In time, they became the official &quot;Facing colour&quot;. On some occasions, regiments were referred to, for example, as the &quot;blue&quot; regiment or the &quot;white&quot; regiment from these colours, though in formal correspondence they were referred to by the name of their colonel. Each company had its own standard, square. The colonel&#x27;s company&#x27;s standard was plain, the lieutenant colonel&#x27;s had a cross of Saint George in the upper corner nearest the staff, the major&#x27;s had a &quot;flame&quot; issuing from the cross, and the captains&#x27; standards had increasing numbers of heraldic decorations, such as roundels or crosses to indicate their seniority.

The New Model Army always had two musketeers for each pikeman, though depictions of battles show them present in equal numbers.

Pikemen, when fully equipped, wore a pot helmet, back- and breastplates over a buff coat, and often also armoured tassets to protect the upper legs. They carried a sixteen-foot pike, and a sword. The heavily burdened pikeman usually dictated the speed of the Army&#x27;s movement. They were frequently ordered to discard the tassets, and individual soldiers were disciplined for sawing a foot or two from the butts of their pikes, although senior officers were recommended to make the men accustomed to marching with heavy loads by regular route marches. In irregular fighting in Ireland, the New Model temporarily gave up the pike. In battle, the pikemen were supposed to project a solid front of spearheads, to protect the musketeers from cavalry while they reloaded. They also led the infantry advance against enemy foot units, when things came to push of pike.

The musketeers wore no armour, at least by the end of the Civil War, although it is not certain that none had iron helmets at the beginning. They wore a bandolier from which were suspended twelve wooden containers, each with a ball and measured charge of powder for their matchlock muskets. These containers are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Twelve Apostles&quot;. According to one source, they carried 1 lb of fine powder, for priming, to 2 lbs of lead and 2 lbs of ordinary powder, the actual charging powder, for 3 lbs of lead. They were normally deployed six ranks deep, and were supposed to keep up a constant fire by means of the &quot;countermarch&quot;—either by introduction whereby the rear rank filed to the front to fire a volley, or by &quot;retroduction&quot; where the front rank fired a volley then filed to the rear. By the time that they reached the front rank again, they should have reloaded and been prepared to fire. At close quarters, there was often no time for musketeers to reload, and they used their musket butts as clubs. They carried swords, but these were often of inferior quality, and ruined by use for cutting firewood.

===Artillery===

The establishment of the New Model Army&#x27;s artillery varied over time, and the artillery was administered separately from the Horse and Foot. At the Army&#x27;s formation, Thomas Hammond (brother of Colonel Robert Hammond who commanded a Regiment of Foot) was appointed Lieutenant General of the Ordnance.

The establishment of the New Model also included at least two companies of &quot;firelocks&quot; or fusiliers, who wore &quot;tawny coats&quot; instead of red, commanded initially by Major John Desborough.

The artillery was used to most effect in sieges, where its role was to blast breaches in fortifications for the infantry to assault. Cromwell and the other commanders of the Army were not trained in siege warfare and generally tried to take fortified towns by storm rather than go through the complex and time-consuming process of building earthworks and trenches around it so that batteries of cannon could be brought close to the walls to pound it into surrender. The Army generally performed well when storming fortifications, for example at the siege of Drogheda, but paid a heavy price at Clonmel when Cromwell ordered them to attack a well-defended breach.

===Logistics===
The New Model did not use tents, instead being quartered in whatever buildings (houses, barns etc.) were available, until they began to serve in the less populated areas of the countries of Ireland and Scotland. In 1650, their tents were each for six men, a file, who carried the tents in parts. In campaigns in Scotland, the troops carried with them seven days&#x27; rations, consisting exclusively of biscuit and cheese.

==Civil War campaigns==

The Army took the field in late April or May, 1645. After an attempt to raise the siege of Taunton was abandoned, the Army began a siege of Oxford, sending a detachment of one regiment of cavalry and four of infantry to reinforce the defenders of Taunton. After the Royalists captured Leicester, Fairfax was ordered to leave Oxford and march north to confront the King&#x27;s army. On 14 June, the New Model destroyed King Charles&#x27; smaller but veteran army at the Battle of Naseby. Leaving the Scots and locally raised forces to contain the King, Fairfax marched into the West Country, where they destroyed the remaining Royalist field army at Langport on 10 July. Thereafter, they reduced the Royalist fortresses in the west and south of England. The last fortress in the west surrendered in early 1646, shortly before Charles surrendered himself to a Scottish army and hostilities ended.

===Revolutionary politics and the &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;===
Having won the First Civil War, the soldiers became discontented with the Long Parliament, for several reasons. Firstly, they had not been paid regularly – pay was weeks in arrears – and on the end of hostilities, the conservative MPs in Parliament wanted to either disband the Army or send them to fight in Ireland without addressing the issue of back pay. Secondly, the Long Parliament refused to grant the soldiers amnesty from prosecution for any criminal acts they had been ordered to commit in the Civil War. The soldiers demanded indemnity as several soldiers were hanged after the war for crimes such as stealing horses for use by the cavalry regiments. Thirdly, seeing that most Parliamentarians wanted to restore the King without major democratic reforms or religious freedom.

Two representatives, called Agitators, were elected from each regiment. The Agitators, with two officers from each regiment and the Generals, formed a new body called the Army Council. At a meeting (&quot;rendezvous&quot;) held near Newmarket, Suffolk on 4 June 1647 this council issued &quot;A Solemne Engagement of the Army, under the Command of his Excellency Sir Thomas Fairfax&quot; to Parliament on 8 June making their concerns known.
Having come into contact with ideas from the radical movement called the Levellers, the troops of the Army proposed a revolutionary new constitution named the Agreement of the People, which called for almost universal male suffrage, electoral boundary reform, power to rest with a Parliament elected by the people every two years, religious freedom, and an end to imprisonment for debt.

Increasingly concerned at the failure to pay their wages and by political manoeuvrings by King Charles I and by some in Parliament, the army marched slowly towards London over the next few months. In late October and early November at the Putney Debates, the Army debated two different proposals. The first was the &quot;Agreement of the People&quot;; the other was the &quot;Heads of Proposals&quot;, put forward by Henry Ireton for the Army Council.

===Second English Civil War===

The army remained under control and intact, so it was able to take the field when the Second English Civil War broke out in July 1648. The New Model Army routed English royalist insurrections in Surrey and Kent, and in Wales, before crushing a Scottish invasion force at the Battle of Preston in August.

Many of the Army&#x27;s radicals now called for the execution of the King, whom they called &quot;Charles Stuart, that man of blood&quot;. The majority of the Grandees realised that they could neither negotiate a settlement with Charles I, nor trust him to refrain from raising another army to attack them, so they came reluctantly to the same conclusion as the radicals: they would have to execute him. After the Long Parliament rejected the Army&#x27;s &quot;Remonstrance&quot; by 125 to 58, the Grandees decided to reconstitute Parliament so that it would agree with the Army&#x27;s position. On 6 December 1648, Colonel Thomas Pride instituted Pride&#x27;s Purge and forcibly removed from the House of Commons all those who were not supporters of the religious independents and the Grandees in the Army. The much-reduced Rump Parliament passed the necessary legislation to try Charles I. He was found guilty of high treason by the 59 Commissioners and beheaded on 30 January 1649.

During 1649, there were three mutinies over pay and political demands. The first involved 300 infantrymen of Colonel John Hewson&#x27;s regiment, who declared that they would not serve in Ireland until the Levellers&#x27; programme had been realised. They were cashiered without arrears of pay, which was the threat that had been used to quell the mutiny at the Corkbush Field rendezvous.

In the Bishopsgate mutiny, soldiers of the regiment of Colonel Edward Whalley stationed in Bishopsgate, in London, made demands similar to those of Hewson&#x27;s regiment. They were ordered out of London.

Less than two weeks later, there was a larger mutiny involving several regiments over pay and political demands. After the resolution of the pay issue, the Banbury mutineers, consisting of 400 soldiers with Leveller sympathies under the command of Captain William Thompson, continued to negotiate for their political demands. They set out for Salisbury in the hope of rallying support from the regiments billeted there. Cromwell launched a night attack on 13 May, in which several mutineers perished, but Captain Thompson escaped, only to be killed in another skirmish near the Diggers community at Wellingborough. The rest were imprisoned in Burford Church until three were shot in the Churchyard on 17 May.

====Regiments added before or during the Second Civil War====
===Ireland===

Later that year, on 15 August 1649, the New Model Army landed in Ireland to start the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. At Kilkenny, in March 1650, the town&#x27;s defenders skilfully beat back numerous Parliamentarian assaults before being forced to surrender. Shortly afterwards, about 2,000 soldiers of the New Model died in abortive assaults against a breach defended by veteran Ulstermen in the siege of Clonmel. These bloody scenes were repeated during the siege of Charlemont Fort later that year.

The Army was also constantly at risk of attack by Irish guerrillas called &quot;tóraithe&quot; (&quot;tories&quot; in English), literally meaning &quot;pursuer&quot;.

Overall, around 43,000 English soldiers, fought in the Parliamentarian army in Ireland between 1649 and 1653. In addition, some 9,000 Irish Protestants also served.

The Army generally performed well when storming fortifications, for example at the siege of Drogheda, but paid a heavy price at Clonmel when Cromwell ordered them to attack a well-defended breach.

===Scotland===

In 1650, while the campaign in Ireland was still continuing, part of the New Model Army was transferred to Scotland to fight Scottish Covenanters at the start of the Third English Civil War. The Covenanters, who had been allied to the Parliament in the First English Civil War, had now crowned Charles II as King. Despite being outnumbered, Cromwell led the Army to crushing victories over the Scots at the battles of Dunbar and Inverkeithing. Following the Scottish invasion of England led by Charles II, the New Model Army and local militia forces soundly defeated the Royalists at the Battle of Worcester, the last pitched battle of the English Civil Wars.

==Interregnum==
In England, the New Model Army was involved in numerous skirmishes with a range of opponents, but these were little more than policing actions. The largest rebellion of the Protectorate took place when the Sealed Knot instigated an insurrection in 1655.

The major foreign entanglement of this period was the Anglo-Spanish War. In 1654, the English Commonwealth declared war on Spain, and regiments of the New Model Army were sent to conquer the Spanish colony of Hispaniola in the Caribbean. They failed in the conflict and sustained heavy casualties from tropical disease. They took over the lightly defended island of Jamaica. The English troops performed better in the European theatre of the war in Flanders. During the Battle of the Dunes (1658), as part of Turenne&#x27;s army, the red-coats of the New Model Army under the leadership of Sir William Lockhart, Cromwell&#x27;s ambassador at Paris, astonished both their French allies and Spanish enemies by the stubborn fierceness with which they advanced against a strongly defended sandhill high.

After Cromwell died, the Protectorate died a slow death, as did the New Model Army. For a time, in 1659, it appeared that factions of the New Model army forces loyal to different generals might wage war on each other. Regiments garrisoned in Scotland under the command of General Monck were marched to London to ensure the security of the capital prior to the Restoration, without significant opposition from the regiments under other generals, particularly those led by Charles Fleetwood and John Lambert. Following the riots led by Thomas Venner in 1661, which were quelled with the aid of soldiers from Monck&#x27;s Regiment of Foot and the Regiment of Cuirassiers, the New Model Army was ordered disbanded, with the large arrears of pay financed by a poll tax. Monck&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, upon the end of the New Model Army, was incorporated into the army of Charles II as the Coldstream Guards.

Some of the demobilized soldiers and officers of the New Model Army were sent to Portugal, to support the Portuguese Restoration War and help Portugal regain its independence after many decades of Spanish rule. The British brigade, which numbered 3,000, arrived in Portugal in August 1662 and proved a decisive factor in winning back Portugal&#x27;s independence, defeating the Spanish in a major engagement at Ameixial on 8 June 1663, and this forced John of Austria to abandon Évora and retreat across the border with heavy losses.

He studied theology at Heidelberg under H.E.G. Paulus, at Halle under Wilhelm Gesenius and at Göttingen under Ewald. Returning to Heidelberg he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in theology in 1829, and in 1831 published his &quot;Begriff der Kritik am Alten Testamente praktisch erörtert&quot;, a study of Old Testament criticism in which he explained the critical principles of the grammatico-historical school, and his &quot;Des Propheten Jonas Orakel über Moab&quot;, an exposition of the 5th and 16th chapters of the Book of Isaiah attributed by him to the prophet Jonah mentioned in &quot;2 Kings&quot; xiv. 25.

In 1833 he was called to the University of Zürich as professor ordinarius of theology. His next work was a commentary on Isaiah with a translation (&quot;Übersetzung und Auslegung des Propheten Jesaias&quot;), which he dedicated to Heinrich Ewald, and which Hermann Hupfeld (1796–1866), well known as a commentator on the Psalms (1855–1861), pronounced to be his best exegetical work. At Zürich he laboured for a period of twenty-eight years, during which, besides commentaries on &quot;The Psalms&quot; (1835–1836; 2nd ed., 1863–1865), &quot;The Minor Prophets&quot; (1838; 3rd ed., 1863), &quot;Jeremiah&quot; (1841; 2nd ed., 1866), &quot;Ezekiel&quot; (1847), &quot;Daniel&quot; (1850), &quot;Ecclesiastes&quot; (1847), &quot;Canticles&quot; (1855), and &quot;Proverbs&quot; (1858), he published a monograph, &quot;Über Johannes Markus und seine Schriften&quot; (1843), in which he maintained the chronological priority of the second gospel. He wrote works of archaeological interest, of which the most important are &quot;Die Erfindung des Alphabets&quot; (1840), &quot;Urgeschichte und Mythologie der Philister&quot; (1845), and &quot;Die Grabschrift des Eschmunezar&quot; (1855).

After the death in 1860 of Friedrich Umbreit, one of the founders of the well-known &quot;Studien und Kritiken&quot;, Hitzig was called to succeed him as professor of theology at Heidelberg. Here he wrote his &quot;Geschichte des Volkes Israel&quot; (1869–1870), in two parts, extending respectively to the end of the Persian domination and to the fall of Masada, 72 AD, as well as a work on the Pauline epistles, &quot;Zur Kritik Paulinischer Briefe&quot; (1870), on the Moabite Stone, &quot;Die Inschrift des Mescha&quot; (1870), and on Assyrian, &quot;Sprache und Sprachen Assyriens&quot; (1871), besides revising the commentary on Job by Ludwig Hirzel, first published in 1839.

He was also a contributor to the &quot;Monatsschrift des wissenschaftlichen Vereins&quot; in Zürich, the &quot;Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft&quot;, the &quot;Theologische Studien und Kritiken&quot;, Eduard Zeller&#x27;s &quot;Theologische Jahrbücher&quot;, and Adolf Hilgenfeld&#x27;s &quot;Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Theologie&quot;. Hitzig died at Heidelberg.

His lectures on biblical theology (&quot;Vorlesungen über biblische Theologie und messianische Weissagungen&quot;) were published in 1880 after his death, along with a portrait and biographical sketch by his pupil, J. J. Kneucker (b. 1840), professor of theology at Heidelberg.

== Belshazzar and his historicity ==
It has been charged that certain &quot;fundamentalists&quot; were wrong in citing Hitzig as an example of those who denied the historicity of Belshazzar. But Hitzig really did hold the erroneous position ascribed to him by conservative scholars, as shown by what he wrote in his commentary on the Book of Daniel.Selbst den Fall gesetzt, dass der fragliche Koenig Mediens existiert habe, wurde der Name, unter welchen er bei Daniel auftritt, zu beanstanden sein. Jene zweiheit in Nabonned = Baltasar wiederholt sich in Cyaxares = Darius, und wieder zu Daniels nachteil.
Translation:
Even supposing that the king of the Medes in question [i.e., Darius; Dan 5:31] had existed, the objection is the name under which he is referenced in Daniel. Each of the two were standardized in Nabonidus = Belshazzar which is repeated in Cyaxares = Darius, to Daniel’s discredit.
Hitzig thought that, historically, there was no such person as Belshazzar, or alternately, that the deluded author of the book of Daniel made two mistakes: he gave Nabonidus the name Belshazzar and Cyraxares the name Darius. Hitzig&#x27;s position logically followed from his presupposition that the book of Daniel was a fraud perpetrated by a nameless author in Maccabean times. Such a deceiver could not have known a genuine name of Belshazzar from the sixth century BC, because at the time Hitzig wrote, all resources available to him outside of the Bible and texts derived from the Bible named Nabonidus as the last king of Babylon, without any mention of Belshazzar. This conclusion was therefore a natural consequence of the starting assumptions, which were the presuppositions accepted by the radical criticism of the day. As the Jewish Encyclopedia explains: The name &quot;Belshazzar&quot; was previously held to have been invented by the author of the Book of Daniel, which has long been recognized as a Maccabean production (see DANIEL). Since the discovery and decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, however, &quot;Belshazzar&quot; is now generally admitted to be the Hebrew-Aramaic equivalent of the Babylonian form ‘Belsharuṣur’ (Bel preserve the king), which has been found in the cuneiform documents as the name of the eldest son of Nabonidus (Nabuna&#x27;id), the last native king of Babylon (555-538 B.C.).
A modern evaluation of Hitzig&#x27;s scholarship should take into consideration not only his starting presuppositions, but also how the deductions from those presuppositions have led to numerous errors in judgment that have later proved to be unsustainable.

<doc id="181151" wikidata="Q922247" url="?curid=181151" title="Mallow, County Cork">
<text>Mallow (; ) is a town in County Cork, Ireland, approximately thirty-five kilometres north of Cork. Mallow is in a townland and civil parish of the same name, in the barony of Fermoy.

It is the administrative centre of north County Cork, and the Northern Divisional Offices of Cork County Council are located in the town. Mallow is part of the Cork North-Central Dáil constituency after being moved from the Cork East Dáil Constituency in 2023.

==Name==
The earliest form of the name is &quot;Magh nAla&quot;, meaning &quot;plain of the stone&quot;. In the anglicisation &quot;Mallow&quot;, &quot;-ow&quot; originally represented a reduced schwa sound (), which is now however pronounced as a full vowel . In 1975, &quot;Mala&quot;—a shortening of &quot;Magh nAla&quot;—was among the first Irish placenames adopted by statute, on the advice of the Placenames branch of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.

In the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;, compiled in the 1630s, &quot;Magh nAla&quot; is misrepresented as &quot;Magh Eala&quot;, the County Donegal-based authors being insufficiently familiar with County Cork places. P.W. Joyce in 1869 surmised that in &quot;Magh Eala&quot; , &quot;Ealla&quot; referred to the river Blackwater, and connected the name to the nearby barony of Duhallow. Professor T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly in 1938 interpreted &quot;Magh Eala&quot; as &quot;plain of the swans&quot;. This false etymology remains widely cited and has caused resentment by some of the official &quot;Mala&quot; as being a gratuitous simplification of &quot;Magh Eala&quot;. However, the name &quot;Mala&quot; has been used in Irish for more than 300 years.

==History==
Evidence of pre-historic settlement is found in Beenalaght (13.6 km/8.5 miles south-west of Mallow), where an alignment of six standing stones lie on a hill to the west of the Mallow-Coachford Road. (grid ref: 485 873, Latitude: 52.035818N Longitude: 8.751181W).

The first Mallow Castle was first built in 1185 on the orders of King John.

===Williamite War in Ireland (1690)===
On 16 September 1690, shortly after the failed Siege of Limerick but before the Siege of Cork, Colonel Moritz Melchior von Donop, commanding of the second regiment of Danish cavalry, reconnoitred Mallow and destroyed the bridge. He reported encountering a group of Jacobite raparees in Mallow, perhaps 3000 strong. Following his return Major General Ernst von Tettau and Major General Scravenmore devised a ruse whereby a small force of 100 cavalry and 50 dragoons was detached from the overall force of 1200 Horse, 300 Dragoons, and 2 Companies of Danish Foot. These acted as bait and successfully lured out the Jacobites commanded by Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan and routing them, with 300 raparees dead. Some accounts claim that only Sarsfield and five companions escaped the battle.

===Irish War of Independence===
During the Irish War of Independence, the town served as the headquarters of the North Cork Militia (also known as North Cork Rifles), a unit in the Irish Republican Army (IRA). On 27 September, IRA commanders Ernie O&#x27;Malley and Liam Lynch led the Cork No. 2 Brigade in an attack against the military barracks in Mallow, which was garrisoned by elements of the 17th Lancers. The successful attack saw the IRA capture large quantities of firearms and ammunition, partially burning the barracks in the process. In reprisal, angered soldiers from Buttevant and Fermoy went on a rampage in Mallow, burning several main street premises, including the town hall and creamery, on the next day.

In February 1921, the IRA killed the wife of RIC Captain W. H. King during a botched assassination attempt on her husband near the Mallow railway station. In retaliation, a detachment of the Black and Tans briefly occupied the station, arresting and killing three of its occupants- Patrick Devitt, Daniel Mullane and Denis Bennett, all of whom were railway workers. The killings prompted an industrial action by the National Railworkers Union in Britain and Ireland.

==Geography==
Mallow lies on the River Blackwater, and developed as a defensive settlement protecting an important fort on the river.
Mallow, as with other parts of North Cork, is in an area &quot;likely to have high radon levels&quot;. A 2007 reading, at one building in the town, was one of the highest levels of the gas ever found in Ireland, being more than 60 times above the acceptable limit.

==Demography==
As of the 2016 census, the town had a population of 12,459. In the same census the population was reportedly made up of 76% white Irish, 1% white Irish travellers, 12% other white ethnicities, 4% black, 2% Asian, 2% other, with 3% not stating their ethnicity.

==Economy==
Irish statesmen such as Thomas Davis and William O&#x27;Brien were both born in Mallow in the 19th century. The main street in Mallow is called Davis Street (although commonly referred to as Main Street), and joins with William O&#x27;Brien Street outside Mallow Town Hall. At the point where Davis Street meets O&#x27;Brien Street there is a monument to J.J. Fitzgerald, a little-known local politician who was involved in establishing both Mallow Urban District Council and Cork County Council.

The town developed an industrial base in the early 20th century, based largely on its agricultural capability, with dairy produce and sugar beet supplying a sugar factory, operated by Greencore.

==Transport and communications==

===Road===
Mallow lies at the convergence of several important routes: National Primary Route 20 (N20) north-south road between Cork (35 km) and Limerick (70 km), National Secondary Route 72 (N72) east-west between Dungarvan (51.5 km) and Killarney (41.5 km), National Secondary Route 73 (N73) northeast to Mitchelstown and the M8 motorway (21 km).
===Bus===
Mallow is a stop on the Bus Éireann 51 bus service from Cork to Galway and 243 bus service from Cork to Newmarket service. Mallow is also serviced by the TFI Local Link buses, connecting the town with Fermoy, Mitchelstown and Charleville via three separate routes, with stops in intermediary villages.

===Rail===
The Mallow railway viaduct which straddles the Blackwater, commonly known as the &quot;Ten Arch Bridge&quot;, was bombed and destroyed during the Irish Civil War. It was rapidly rebuilt in girder form due to its importance in connecting the Cork, Tralee and Dublin lines. An additional line east through Fermoy and Lismore to the Waterford South station closed in 1967. Mallow railway station was opened on 17 March 1849 by the Great Southern and Western Railway. It is served by trains to via Limerick Junction to Dublin Heuston, Cork and Killarney, Farranfore and Tralee.

Onward connecting trains link Mallow via Limerick Junction to Limerick, Ennis, Athenry and Galway as well as Carrick-on-Suir and Waterford.

===Air===
The nearest airports are Cork Airport (42.5 km), Kerry Airport (70 km) and Shannon Airport (84 km). Kerry Airport is accessible by train from Farranfore railway station.

There is a flying club at nearby Rathcoole Aerodrome, and a helicopter charter company in nearby Dromahane.

Mallow Racecourse, now known as Cork Racecourse, became an emergency airfield on 18 April 1983, when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet piloted by Captain Reuben Ocaña made a precautionary landing. A temporary tarmacadam runway of 910 m (3,000 ft) in length which was paid for by the plane&#x27;s insurers was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later. In the meantime, Captain Ocaña became a local celebrity. On 23 May 1983 just before the plane departed, the captain said his farewell to the people of Ireland in the Irish language. The runway was subsequently used for parking during race meets and for learner driving. Light aircraft have occasionally landed at the racecourse on the grass area. The F3A World Model Aircraft Aerobatic Championship was held there in 2001. The 1983 incident formed the basis of the 2010 film &quot;&quot;.

==Sport==
Founded in 1882, Mallow Rugby Club is one of the oldest rugby clubs in the country. Former players include Munster Second Row Ian Nagle, who played juvenile rugby for Mallow and Ulster Prop Jerry Cronin, who played juvenile and Junior Rugby for the club.

The town&#x27;s association football club, Mallow United Football Club, was founded in 1926 and fields senior, junior, schoolboy, and schoolgirl football teams in the Munster Leagues.

The local racecourse, Cork Racecourse, now renamed &quot;Cork Racecourse Mallow&quot;, plays host to large horse racing events.

Mallow GAA is the town&#x27;s GAA club, and fields teams in hurling and Gaelic football. The club won the 2017 Cork Premier Intermediate Football Championship.

Mallow Golf Club, founded in 1947, is located just outside Mallow and has 18 holes. Mallow AC is a local running club.

==Amenities==
Mallow is home to a branch of the Gate Cinema as well as a county library with an exhibition space. Other community amenities include a youth centre and a public swimming pool. The town also has several gyms and pubs. A farmers&#x27; market is held in the grounds of St James&#x27; Church on Friday mornings. Mallow Castle also hosts seasonal events.

<text>Friedrich Carl von Savigny (21 February 1779 – 25 October 1861) was a German jurist and historian.

==Early life and education==
Savigny was born at Frankfurt am Main, of a family recorded in the history of Lorraine, deriving its name from the castle of Savigny near Charmes in the valley of the Moselle. Left as orphan at the age of 13, Savigny was brought up by a guardian. In 1795, he entered the University of Marburg, where, though in poor health, he studied under Professors and , the former a pioneer in the reform of the German criminal law, the latter distinguished for his knowledge of medieval jurisprudence. After the fashion of German students, Savigny visited several universities, notably Jena, Leipzig and Halle; and returning to Marburg, took his doctorate in 1800. At Marburg he lectured as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; on criminal law and the Pandects.

==Work==
In 1803 Savigny published &quot;Das Recht des Besitzes&quot; (The Law of Possession). Anton Thibaut hailed it as a masterpiece which brought the old uncritical study of Roman law to an end. It quickly obtained a European reputation, and remains a prominent landmark in the history of jurisprudence. In 1804 he married Kunigunde Brentano, sister of Bettina von Arnim and Clemens Brentano the poet. The same year he embarked on an extensive tour through France and south Germany in search of fresh sources of Roman law.

In 1808 Savigny was appointed full professor of Roman law at Landshut. He remained in this position for a year and a half. In 1810 he was appointed to the chair of Roman law at the new University of Berlin, chiefly at the insistence of Wilhelm von Humboldt. Here, in connection with the faculty of law, he created a &quot;Spruch-Collegium&quot;, an extraordinary tribunal competent to deliver opinions on cases remitted to it by the ordinary courts; and he took an active part in its labours. This was the busiest time of his life. He was engaged in lecturing, in government of the university (of which he was the third rector), and as tutor to the crown prince in Roman, criminal and Prussian law. During his time in Berlin, Savigny befriended Barthold Georg Niebuhr and Karl Friedrich Eichhorn.

In 1814 Savigny wrote the pamphlet &#x27; (Of the Vocation of our Age for Legislation and Legal Science). In an earlier pamphlet Thibaut had argued for the creation of a unified legal code for Germany, independent of the influence of foreign legal systems. Savigny argued that such a codification of the law would have an adverse effect. In his view, the damage that had been caused by the neglect of former generations of jurists could not be quickly repaired, and more time was required to set the house in order. Moreover, a unified legal code would almost certainly be influenced by natural law, with its &quot;infinite arrogance&quot; and its &quot;shallow philosophy&quot;. It was Savigny&#x27;s opinion that legal science should be saved from the &quot;hollow abstractions&quot; of such a work as Christian Wolff&#x27;s &#x27;. Savigny opposed this conception of legal science to the &quot;historical study of positive law&quot;, which according to him is &quot;a condition precedent to right understanding of the science of all law&quot;. Savigny did not oppose the introduction of new laws or of a new system of laws, but considered that the laws of any nation should reflect the &quot;national spirit (&quot;Volksgeist&quot;)&quot;.

In 1815 Savigny, together with Eichhorn and , founded the &quot;&quot; (Journal for Historical Legal Science), the organ of the new historical school. In this periodical (vol. iii. p. 129 seq.) Savigny made known to the world the discovery by Niebuhr in Verona of the lost &quot;Institutes&quot; of Gaius. Savigny pronounced it to be the work of Gaius himself and not, as Niebuhr had suggested, of Ulpian.

The same year, 1815, Savigny published the first volume of his &quot;&quot; (History of Roman Law in the Middle Ages), the sixth and final volume of which did not appear until 1831. He had been prompted to write this work by his early instructor Weiss. Savigny intended it to be a literary history of Roman law from Irnerius to the present time. His design was in some respects narrowed; in others it was widened. He did not continue the narrative beyond the 16th century, when the separation of nationalities disturbed the foundations of the science of law. In the first volume, Savigny treated the history of Roman law from the breaking up of the empire until the beginning of the 12th century. According to Savigny, Roman law, although considered dead, lived on in local customs, in towns, in ecclesiastical doctrines and school teachings, until it once again reappeared in Bologna and other Italian cities.

In 1817 Savigny was appointed a member of the commission for organizing the Prussian provincial estates, and also a member of the department of justice in the &#x27; (State Council). In 1819 he became a member of the supreme court of appeal for the Rhine Provinces. In 1820 he was made a member of the commission for revising the Prussian code. In 1822 he was afflicted with nervous illness, which compelled him to seek relief in travel. In 1835 Savigny began his elaborate work on contemporary Roman law, &#x27; (8 vols., 1840–1849). His activity as professor ceased in March 1842, when he was appointed &quot;&quot; (High Chancellor), the head of the Prussian legal system. In this position he carried out several important law reforms in regard to bills of exchange and divorce. He held the office until 1848, when he resigned.

In 1850, on the occasion of the jubilee of obtaining his doctor&#x27;s degree, appeared in five volumes his &quot;Vermischte Schriften&quot; (Miscellaneous Writings), consisting of a collection of minor works published between 1800 and 1844. Savigny was hailed throughout Germany as &quot;the great master&quot; and founder of modern jurisprudence. In 1851 and 1853 he published the two volumes of his treatise on the law of obligations, &quot;&quot;, mostly on what English-speaking lawyers consider as contract law. It was a supplement to his work on modern Roman law, in which he again argued for the necessity of the historical treatment of law.

Savigny died in Berlin. His son, Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1814–1875), was Prussian minister of foreign affairs in 1849. He represented Prussia in important diplomatic transactions, especially in 1866.

==Ideas and influence==
Savigny belongs to the German historical school of jurists, founded by Gustav Hugo, and served a role in its consolidation. The works for which Savigny is best known are the &quot;Recht des Besitzes&quot; and the &quot;Beruf unserer Zeit für Gesetzgebung&quot;. According to Jhering &quot;with the &quot;Recht des Besitzes&quot; the juridical method of the Romans was regained, and modern jurisprudence born.&quot; It was seen as a great advance both in results and method, and rendered obsolete a large body of literature. Savigny argued that in Roman law possession had always reference to &quot;usucapion&quot; or to &quot;interdicts&quot;. It did not include a right to continuance in possession but only to immunity from interference as possession is based on the consciousness of unlimited power. These and other propositions were derived by the interpretation and harmonization of the Roman jurists. However, many of Savigny&#x27;s conclusions did not meet with universal acclaim. They were opposed by, among others, Jhering, Gans, and Bruns.

Savigny argued in the &quot;Beruf unserer Zeit&quot; that law is part and parcel of national life. He opposed the idea, common to French 18th century jurists and Bentham, that law can be arbitrarily imposed on a country irrespective of its state of civilization and history. Another important idea of Savigny is that the practice and theory of jurisprudence cannot be divorced without injury to both.

<text>Heroldo de Esperanto () is a magazine published in Esperanto. It was founded in 1920 by Teo Jung in Cologne under the name of &quot;Esperanto Triumfonta&quot; and was edited by Jung from 1920 to 1961.

In the years before the Second World War it appeared on a weekly basis. It survived until 1936, when it was closed down by the German Nazi Party authorities and its presses were confiscated.

Jung and his wife left Germany for the Netherlands, where he began publishing again. After a break during the war, the paper again appeared, but this time was published fortnightly.

The editorship was held by Ada Fighiera Sikorska from 1962 until 1996. In 1966 the paper was sold to LF-koop in Switzerland and the editorship was undertaken by Perla Martinelli until the publication of issue no. 2000. Stano Marček then edited it for 2 years.

Under the ownership of LF-koop it has become independent of the traditional Esperanto movement. At present it is edited by a multinational editorial committee and appears on a three-weekly basis. The content is overwhelmingly concerned with the activities of the Esperanto movement.

In June 2016 the paper was sold to Lexus publishing house in Brazil, whose editorship will begin in January 2017; but only one number was published after December 2016.

In January 2018 the paper was sold to Kultura Centro Esperantista (Esperanto Cultural Centre), whose monthly newsletter it is, but also discussing wider issue of the Esperanto-speaking community, is published regularly in Switzerland.

<doc id="181158" wikidata="Q9285" url="?curid=181158" title="Coma Berenices">
<text>Coma Berenices is an ancient asterism in the northern sky, which has been defined as one of the 88 modern constellations. It is in the direction of the fourth galactic quadrant, between Leo and Boötes, and it is visible in both hemispheres. Its name means &quot;Berenice&#x27;s Hair&quot; in Latin and refers to Queen Berenice II of Egypt, who sacrificed her long hair as a votive offering. It was introduced to Western astronomy during the third century BC by Conon of Samos and was further corroborated as a constellation by Gerardus Mercator and Tycho Brahe. It is the only modern constellation named after a historic person.

The constellation&#x27;s major stars are Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Comae Berenices. They form a half square, along the diagonal of which run Berenice&#x27;s imaginary tresses, formed by the Coma Star Cluster. The constellation&#x27;s brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, a 4.2-magnitude main sequence star similar to the Sun. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole and one of the richest-known galaxy clusters, the Coma Cluster, part of the Coma Supercluster. Galaxy Malin 1, in the constellation, is the first-known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy. Supernova SN 1940B was the first scientifically observed (underway) type II supernova. FK Comae Berenices is the prototype of an eponymous class of variable stars. The constellation is the radiant of one meteor shower, Coma Berenicids, which has one of the fastest meteor speeds, up to .

== History ==

Coma Berenices has been recognized as an asterism since the Hellenistic period (or much earlier, according to some authors), and is the only modern constellation named for an historic figure. It was introduced to Western astronomy during the third century BC by Conon of Samos, the court astronomer of Egyptian ruler Ptolemy III Euergetes, to honour Ptolemy&#x27;s consort, Berenice II. Berenice vowed to sacrifice her long hair as a votive offering if Ptolemy returned safely from battle during the Third Syrian War. Modern scholars are uncertain if Berenice made the sacrifice before or after Ptolemy&#x27;s return; it was suggested that it happened after Ptolemy&#x27;s return (around March–June or May 245 BC), when Conon presented the asterism jointly with scholar and poet Callimachus during a public evening ceremony. In Callimachus&#x27; poem, &quot;Aetia&quot; (composed around that time), Berenice dedicated her tresses &quot;to all the gods&quot;. In Poem 66, the Latin translation by the Roman poet Catullus, and in Hyginus&#x27; &quot;De Astronomica&quot;, she dedicated her tresses to Aphrodite and placed them in the temple of Arsinoe II (identified after Berenice&#x27;s death with Aphrodite) at Zephyrium. According to &quot;De astronomica&quot;, by the next morning the tresses had disappeared. Conon proposed that Aphrodite had placed the tresses in the sky as an acknowledgement of Berenice&#x27;s sacrifice. Callimachus called the asterism &quot;plokamos Berenikēs&quot; or &quot;bostrukhon Berenikēs&quot; in Greek, translated into Latin as &quot;Coma Berenices&quot; by Catullus. Hipparchus and Geminus also recognized it as a distinct constellation. Eratosthenes called it &quot;Berenice&#x27;s Hair&quot; and &quot;Ariadne&#x27;s Hair&quot;, considering it part of the constellation Leo. Similarly, Ptolemy did not include it among his 48 constellations in the &quot;Almagest&quot;; considering it part of Leo and calling it &quot;Plokamos&quot;.
Coma Berenices became popular during the 16th century. In 1515, a set of gores by Johannes Schöner labelled the asterism &quot;Trica&quot;, &quot;hair&quot;. In 1536 it appeared on a celestial globe by Caspar Vopel, who is credited with the asterism&#x27;s designation as a constellation. That year, it also appeared on a celestial map by Petrus Apianus as &quot;Crines Berenices&quot;. In 1551, Coma Berenices appeared on a celestial globe by Gerardus Mercator with five Latin and Greek names: Cincinnus, &quot;caesaries&quot;, &quot;πλόκαμος&quot;, &quot;Berenicis crinis&quot; and Trica. Mercator&#x27;s reputation as a cartographer ensured the constellation&#x27;s inclusion on Dutch sky globes beginning in 1589.

Tycho Brahe, also credited with Coma&#x27;s designation as a constellation, included it in his 1602 star catalogue. Brahe recorded fourteen stars in the constellation; Johannes Hevelius increased its number to twenty-one, and John Flamsteed to forty-three. Coma Berenices also appeared in Johann Bayer&#x27;s 1603 &quot;Uranometria&quot;, and a few other 17th-century celestial maps followed suit. Coma Berenices and the now-obsolete Antinous are considered the first post-Ptolemaic constellations depicted on a celestial globe. With Antinous, Coma Berenices exemplified a trend in astronomy in which globe- and map-makers continued to rely on the ancients for data. This trend ended at the turn of the 16th century with observations of the southern sky and the work of Tycho Brahe.

Before the 18th century Coma Berenices was known in English by several names, including &quot;Berenice&#x27;s Bush&quot; and &quot;Berenice&#x27;s periwig&quot;. The earliest-known English name, &quot;Berenices haire&quot;, dates to 1601. By 1702 the constellation was known as Coma Berenices, and appears as such in the 1731 &quot;Universal Etymological English Dictionary&quot;.

===Non-Western astronomy===
Coma Berenices was known to the Akkadians as Ḫegala. In Babylonian astronomy a star, known as ḪÉ.GÁL-&quot;a&quot;-&quot;a&quot; (translated as &quot;which is before it&quot;) or MÚL.ḪÉ.GÁL-&quot;a&quot;-&quot;a&quot;, is tentatively considered part of Coma Berenices. It was also argued that Coma Berenices appears in Egyptian Ramesside star clocks as &quot;sb3w ꜥš3w&quot;, meaning &quot;many stars&quot;.

In Arabic astronomy Coma Berenices was known as &quot;Al-Dafira الضفيرة (&quot;braid&quot;),&quot; &quot;Al-Hulba&quot; &quot;الهلبة&quot; and &quot;Al-Thu&#x27;aba الذؤابة&quot; (both meaning &quot;tuft&quot;), the latter two are translations of the Ptolemaic &quot;Plokamos&quot;, forming the tuft of the constellation Leo and including most of the Flamsteed-designated stars (particularly 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18 and 21 Comae Berenices). Al-Sufi included it in Leo. Ulugh Beg, however, regarded &quot;Al-Dafira&quot; as consisting of two stars, 7 and 23 Comae Berenices.

The North American Pawnee people depicted Coma Berenices as ten faint stars on a tanned elk-skin star map dated to at least the 17th century. In the South American Kalina mythology, the constellation was known as &quot;ombatapo&quot; (face).

The constellation was also recognized by several Polynesian peoples. The people of Tonga had four names for Coma Berenices: &quot;Fatana-lua&quot;, &quot;Fata-olunga&quot;, &quot;Fata-lalo&quot; and &quot;Kapakau-o-Tafahi&quot;. The Boorong people called the constellation &quot;Tourt-chinboiong-gherra&quot;, and saw it as a small flock of birds drinking rainwater from a puddle in the of a tree. The people of the Pukapuka atoll may have called it &quot;Te Yiku-o-te-kiole&quot;, although sometimes this name is associated with Ursa Major.

==Characteristics==
Coma Berenices is bordered by Boötes to the east, Canes Venatici to the north, Leo to the west and Virgo to the south. Covering 386.5 square degrees and 0.937% of the night sky, it ranks 42nd of the 88 constellations by area. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Com&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 12 segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , and the declination coordinates are between +13.30° and +33.31°. Coma Berenices is wholly visible to observers north of latitude 56°S. and the constellation&#x27;s midnight culmination occurs on 2 April.

== Features ==

Although it is not large, Coma Berenices contains one galactic supercluster, two galactic clusters, one star cluster and eight Messier objects (including several globular clusters). These objects can be seen with minimal obscuration by dust because the constellation is not in the direction of the galactic plane. Because of that, there are few open clusters (except for the Coma Berenices Cluster, which dominates the northern part of the constellation), diffuse nebulae or planetary nebulae. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole at right ascension and declination (epoch J2000.0).

=== Stars ===
==== Brightest stars ====

Coma Berenices is not particularly bright, as none of its stars are brighter than fourth magnitude, although there are 66 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.

The constellation&#x27;s brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices (43 Comae Berenices in Flamsteed designation, occasionally known as Al-Dafira), at magnitude 4.2 and with a high proper motion. In Coma Berenices&#x27; northeastern region, it is 29.95 ± 0.10 light-years from Earth. A solar analog, it is a yellow-hued F-type main-sequence star with a spectral class of F9.5V B. Beta Comae Berenices is around 36% brighter, and 15% more massive than the Sun, and with a radius 10% larger.

The second-brightest star in Coma Berenices is the 4.3-magnitude, bluish Alpha Comae Berenices (42 Comae Berenices), with the proper name Diadem, in the southeastern part of the constellation. Despite its Alpha Bayer designation, the star is dimmer than Beta Comae Berenices, being one of the cases where designation does not correspond to the brightest star. It is a double star, with the spectral classes of F5V and F6V. The star system is 58.1 ± 0.9 light-years from Earth.

Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C. In the southwestern part of the constellation, it is 169 ± 2 light-years from Earth, Estimated to be around 1.79 times as massive as the Sun, it has expanded to around 10 times its radius. It is the brightest star in the Coma Star Cluster. With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree isosceles triangle from which Berenice&#x27;s imaginary tresses hang.

==== Star systems ====
The star systems of Coma Berenices include binary, double and triple stars. 21 Comae Berenices (proper name Kissin) is a close binary with nearly equal components and an orbital period of 26 years. The system is 272 ± 3 light-years away. The Coma Cluster contains at least eight spectroscopic binaries, and the constellation has seven eclipsing binaries: CC, DD, EK, RW, RZ, SS and UX Comae Berenices.

There are over thirty double stars in Coma Berenices, including 24 Comae Berenices with contrasting colors. Its primary is an orange-hued giant star with a magnitude of 5.0, 610 light-years from Earth, and its secondary is a blue-white-hued star with a magnitude of 6.6. Triple stars include 12 Comae Berenices, 17 Comae Berenices, KR Comae Berenices and Struve 1639.

==== Variable stars ====
Over 200 variable stars are known in Coma Berenices, although many are obscure. Alpha Comae Berenices is a possible Algol variable. FK Comae Berenices, which varies from magnitude 8.14 to 8.33 over a period of 2.4 days, is the prototype for the FK Comae Berenices class of variable stars and the star in which the &quot;flip-flop phenomenon&quot; was discovered. FS Comae Berenices is a semi-regular variable, a red giant with a period of about two months whose magnitude varies between 6.1 and 5.3. R Comae Berenices is a Mira variable with a maximum magnitude of almost 7. There are 123 RR Lyrae variables in the constellation, with many in the M53 cluster. One of these stars, TU Comae Berenices, may have a binary system. The M100 galaxy contains about twenty Cepheid variables, which were observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. Coma Berenices also contains Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variables, such as 13 Comae Berenices and AI Comae Berenices.

In 2019 scientists at Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences announced the discovery of 28 new variable stars in Coma Berenices&#x27; globular cluster NGC 4147.

==== Supernovae ====
A number of supernovae have been discovered in Coma Berenices. Four (SN 1940B, SN 1969H, SN 1987E and SN 1999gs) were in the NGC 4725 galaxy, and another four were discovered in the M99 galaxy (NGC 4254): SN 1967H, SN 1972Q, SN 1986I and SN 2014L. Five were discovered in the M100 galaxy (NGC 4321): SN 1901B, SN 1914A, SN 1959E, SN 1979C and SN 2006X. SN 1940B, discovered on 5 May 1940, was the first observed type II supernova. SN 2005ap, discovered on 3 March 2005, is the second-brightest-known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not visible to the naked eye and was discovered telescopically. SN 1979C, discovered in 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading in visible light.

==== Other stars ====
Coma Berenices also contains the neutron star RBS 1223 and the pulsar PSR B1237+25. RBS 1223 is a member of the Magnificent Seven, a group of young neutron stars. In 1975, the first extra-solar source of extreme ultraviolet, the white dwarf HZ 43, was discovered in Coma Berenices. In 1995, there was a very rare outburst of the WZ Sagittae-type dwarf nova AL Comae Berenices. A June 2003 outburst from GO Comae Berenices, an SU Ursae Majoris-type dwarf nova, was photometrically observed.

=== Exoplanets ===
Coma Berenices has seven known exoplanets. One, HD 108874 b, has Earth-like insolation. WASP-56 is a sun-like star of spectral type G6 and apparent magnitude 11.48 with a planet 0.6 the mass of Jupiter that has a period of 4.6 days.

=== Star clusters ===

==== Coma Star Cluster ====
The Coma Star Cluster represents Berenice&#x27;s sacrificed tresses and as a naked eye object has been known since antiquity, appearing in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t have a Messier or NGC designation, but is in the Melotte catalogue of open clusters (designated Melotte 111) and is also catalogued as Collinder 256. It is a large, diffuse open cluster of about 50 stars ranging between magnitudes five and ten, including several of Coma Berenices&#x27; stars which are visible to the naked eye. The cluster is spread over a huge region (more than five degrees across) near Gamma Comae Berenices. It has such a large apparent size because it is relatively close, only 280 light-years or 86 parsecs away.

==== Globular clusters ====
M53 (NGC 5024) is a globular cluster which was discovered independently by Johann Elert Bode in 1775 and Charles Messier in February 1777; William Herschel was the first to resolve it into stars. The magnitude-7.7 cluster is 56,000 light-years from Earth. Only 1° away is NGC 5053, a globular cluster with a sparser nucleus of stars. Its total luminosity is the equivalent of about 16,000 suns, one of the lowest luminosities of any globular cluster. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1784. NGC 4147 is a somewhat dimmer globular cluster, with a much-smaller apparent size and an apparent magnitude of 10.7.

=== Galaxies ===

====Coma Supercluster====
The Coma Supercluster, itself part of the Coma Filament, contains the Coma and Leo Cluster of galaxies. The Coma Cluster (Abell 1656) is 230 to 300 million light-years away. It is one of the largest-known clusters, with at least 10,000 galaxies (mainly elliptical, with a few spiral galaxies). Due to its distance from Earth, most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes. Its brightest members are NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, both with a magnitude of 13; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer. NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest-known black holes (21 billion solar masses), and NGC 4921 is the cluster&#x27;s brightest spiral galaxy. After observing the Coma Cluster, astronomer Fritz Zwicky first postulated the existence of dark matter during the 1930s. The massive galaxy Dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely of dark matter. Its mass is very similar to that of the Milky Way, but it emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way. NGC 4676, sometimes called the Mice Galaxies, is a pair of interacting galaxies 300 million light-years from Earth. Its progenitor galaxies were spiral, and astronomers estimate that they had their closest approach about 160 million years ago. That approach triggered large regions of star formation in both galaxies, with long &quot;tails&quot; of dust, stars and gas. The two progenitor galaxies are predicted to interact significantly at least one more time before they merge into a larger, probably-elliptical galaxy.

==== Virgo Cluster ====

Coma Berenices contains the northern portion of the Virgo Cluster (also known as the Coma–Virgo Cluster), about 60 million light-years away. The portion includes six Messier galaxies. M85 (NGC 4382), considered elliptical or lenticular, is one of the cluster&#x27;s brighter members at magnitude nine. M85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. However, it is relatively isolated from the rest of the cluster. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as spiral, it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a barred spiral galaxy with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier&#x27;s catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side. Four supernovae have been observed in the galaxy. M100 (NGC 4321), a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on, is one of the cluster&#x27;s brightest. Photographs reveal a brilliant core, two prominent spiral arms, an array of secondary arms and several dust lanes.

==== Other galaxies ====

M64 (NGC 4826) is known as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the prominent dark dust lane in front of the galaxy&#x27;s bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 17.3 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy&#x27;s outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.

NGC 4314 is a face-on barred spiral galaxy at a distance of 40 million light-years. It is unique for its region of intense star formation, creating a ring around its nucleus which was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope. The galaxy&#x27;s prodigious star formation began five million years ago, in a region with a diameter of 1,000 light-years. The core&#x27;s structure is also unique because the galaxy has spiral arms which feed gas into the bar.

NGC 4414 is an unbarred spiral flocculent galaxy about 62 million light-years away. It is one of the closest flocculent spiral galaxies.

NGC 4565 is an edge-on spiral galaxy which appears superimposed on the Virgo Cluster. NGC 4565 has been nicknamed the Needle Galaxy because when seen in full, it appears as a narrow streak of light. Like many edge-on spiral galaxies, it has a prominent dust lane and a central bulge. NGC 4565 has at least two satellite galaxies, and one of them is interacting with it.

NGC 4651, about the size of the Milky Way, has tidal stellar streams gravitationally stripped from a smaller, satellite galaxy. It is about 62 million light-years away. It is located on the outskirts of the cluster, and is also known as the Umbrella Galaxy. Unlike the other spiral galaxies in the cluster, NGC 4651 is rich in neutral hydrogen, which also extends beyond the optical disk. Its star formation is typical for a galaxy of its type.

Spiral galaxy Malin 1 discovered in 1986 is the first-known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy. With UGC 1382, it is also one of the largest low-surface-brightness galaxies.

In 2006 a dwarf galaxy, also named Coma Berenices, was discovered in the constellation from data obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxy is a faint satellite of the Milky Way. It is one of the faintest satellites of the Milky Way - its integrated luminosity is about times that of the Sun (absolute visible magnitude of about −4.1), which is lower than many globular clusters. A high mass to light ratio may mean that the satellite has large amounts of dark matter.

=== Quasars ===
HS 1216+5032 is a bright, gravitationally lensed pair of quasars. W Comae Berenices (or ON 231), a blazar in the constellation&#x27;s northwest, was originally designated a variable star and later found to be a BL Lacertae object. As of 2009, it had the most intense gamma ray spectrum of the sixty known gamma-ray blazars.

=== Gamma-ray bursts ===
Some gamma-ray bursts occurred in Coma Berenices, particularly GRB 050509B on 9 May 2005 and GRB 080607 on 7 June 2008. GRB 050509B, which lasted only 0.03 second, became the first short burst with a detected afterglow.

=== Meteor shower ===
The Coma Berenicids meteor shower peaks around 18 January. Despite the shower&#x27;s low intensity (averaging one or two meteors per hour) its meteors are some of the fastest, with speeds up to .

== In culture ==

Since Callimachus&#x27; poem, Coma Berenices has been occasionally featured in culture. Alexander Pope alludes to the legend in the ending of &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, in which the titular hair is placed among the stars. (The poem would go on to provide the names of some of the moons of Uranus.) In 1886, Spanish artist Luis Ricardo Falero created a mezzotint print personifying Coma Berenices alongside Virgo and Leo. In 1892, the Russian poet Afanasy Fet made the constellation the subject of his short poem, composed for the Countess Natalya Sollogub. The Swedish poet Gunnar Ekelöf wrote the lines &quot;Your friend the comet combed his hair with the Leonids / Berenice let her hair hang down from the sky&quot; in a 1933 poem. American writer and folksinger Richard Fariña mentions Coma Berenices in his 1966 novel &quot;Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up To Me&quot;, sardonically writing about content typical to upper-level astronomy coursework at Cornell: &quot;It&#x27;s the advanced courses give you trouble. Relativity principles, spiral nebula in Coma Berenices, that kind of hassle&quot;. The Bolivian poet, Pedro Shimose, makes Coma Berenices the home address of his &quot;Señorita NGC 4565&quot; in his poem &quot;Carta a una estrella que vive en otra constelación&quot; (&quot;Letter to a star who lives in another constellation&quot;), included in his 1967 collection, &quot;Sardonia&quot;. &quot; The Irish poet W. B. Yeats, in his poem &quot;Her Dream&quot;, refers to &quot;Berenice&#x27;s burning hair&quot; being &quot;nailed upon the night&quot;. Francisco Guerrero, a 20th-century Spanish composer, wrote an orchestral work on the constellation in 1996. In 1999 Irish artist Alice Maher made a series of four oversize drawings, entitled &quot;Coma Berenices&quot;, of entwining black hair coils.

<text>Eduard Gans (March 22, 1797 – May 5, 1839) was a German jurist.

==Biography==
Gans was born in Berlin to prosperous Jewish parents. He studied law first at the Friedrich Wilhelm University, Berlin, then at Göttingen, and finally at Heidelberg, where he attended G. W. F. Hegel&#x27;s lectures, and became thoroughly imbued with the principles of Hegel&#x27;s philosophy. In 1820, after taking his doctor&#x27;s degree, he returned to Berlin as a lecturer. In 1825 he converted to the Evangelical Church in Prussia, and the following year was appointed extraordinary, and in 1828 ordinary, professor in the Berlin University faculty of law. Before converting, he was a member of the Society for the Culture and Science of the Jews, alongside Joel Abraham List, Isaac Marcus Jost and Leopold Zunz.

At this period, the historical school of jurisprudence was coming to the front. Gans, his Hegelian tendencies predisposing him to treat law historically, applied the method to one special branch—the right of succession. His great work, &quot;Erbrecht in weltgeschichtlicher Entwicklung&quot; (1824, 1825, 1829 and 1835), is of enduring value, not only for its extensive survey of facts, but for the admirable manner in which the general theory of the slow evolution of legal principles is presented.

In 1830, and again in 1835, Gans visited Paris, and formed an intimate acquaintance with the leaders of literary culture and criticism there. The liberality of his views, especially on political matters, drew upon Gans the displeasure of the Prussian government, and his course of lectures on the history of the last fifty years (published as &quot;Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der letzten fünfzig Jahre&quot;, Leipzig, 1833–1834) was prohibited. He died in Berlin.

Other works are a treatise on the fundamental laws of property (&quot;Über die Grundlage des Besitzes&quot;, Berlin, 1829), a portion of a systematic work on the Roman civil law (&quot;System des römischen Zivilrechts&quot;, 1827), and a collection of his miscellaneous writings (&quot;Vermischte Schriften&quot;. 1832). Gans edited the &quot;Philosophie der Geschichte in Hegel&#x27;s Werke&quot;, and contributed a preface. He also wrote &quot;Das Erbrecht in Weltgeschichtlicher Entwickelung&quot; (4 vols., 1834) which was translated into French.

<text>The &quot;Nimitz&quot; class is a class of ten nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in service with the United States Navy. The lead ship of the class is named after World War II United States Pacific Fleet commander Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, who was the last living U.S. Navy officer to hold the rank. With an overall length of and a full-load displacement of over , the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class ships were the largest warships built and in service until entered the fleet in 2017.

Instead of the gas turbines or diesel–electric systems used for propulsion on many modern warships, the carriers use two A4W pressurized water reactors. The reactors produce steam to drive steam turbines which drive four propeller shafts and can produce a maximum speed of over and a maximum power of around . As a result of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years. They are categorized as nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and are numbered with consecutive hull numbers from CVN-68 to CVN-77.

All ten carriers were constructed by Newport News Shipbuilding Company in Virginia. , the lead ship of the class, was commissioned on 3 May 1975, and , the tenth and last of the class, was commissioned on 10 January 2009. Since the 1970s, &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers have participated in many conflicts and operations across the world, including Operation Eagle Claw in Iran, the Gulf War, and more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The angled flight decks of the carriers use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft, with steam catapults and arrestor wires for launch and recovery. As well as speeding up flight deck operations, this allows for a much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers. An embarked carrier air wing comprising around 64 aircraft is normally deployed on board. The air wings&#x27; strike fighters are primarily F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets. In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.

The unit cost was about US$8.5 billion in FY 2012 dollars, equal to US$ billion in .

==Description==
The &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carriers have a length of overall and at the waterline, with a beam of overall and at the waterline; the individual ships have slight variations in their dimensions. They were initially designed with a full-load displacement of and a draft of , but the ships would be delivered several thousand tons heavier, particularly for later members of the class. As the vessels were overhauled and installed more equipment, loaded displacement would climb to exceed . For example, currently displaces at full load. The ships&#x27; nominal complement comprises: 3,000–3,200; 1,500 (air wing); and 500 (other).

===Design===
The &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class aircraft carriers were ordered to supplement the aircraft carriers of the and es, maintaining the strength and capability of the U.S. Navy after the older carriers were decommissioned. The ships were designed to be improvements on previous U.S. aircraft carriers, particularly the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and supercarriers, although the arrangement of the vessels is relatively similar to that of the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; class. Among other design improvements, the two reactors on &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers take up less space than the eight reactors used on &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Along with a more generally improved design, &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers can carry 90% more aviation fuel and 50% more ordnance when compared to the &quot;Forrestal&quot; class.

The U.S. Navy has stated that the carriers could withstand three times the damage sustained by the inflicted by Japanese air attacks during World War II. The hangars on the ships are divided into three fire bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire. This addition has been present on U.S. aircraft carriers since World War II, after the fires caused by kamikaze attacks.

The first ships were designed around the time of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability; they were used to send sorties into the war and were, therefore, less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines compared to previous carriers, although this was partly a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships&#x27; propulsion systems.

A major purpose of the carriers was initially to support the U.S. military during the Cold War. They were designed with capabilities for that role, including using nuclear power instead of oil for greater endurance and the ability to adjust their weapons systems on the basis of new intelligence and technological developments. They were initially categorized only as attack carriers, but ships have been constructed with anti-submarine capabilities since . As a result, the ships and their aircraft can participate in a wide range of operations, including sea and air blockades; mine laying; and missile strikes on land, air, and sea.

Because of a design flaw, ships of this class have inherent lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed the capability of their list control systems. The problem appears to be especially prevalent on some of the more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast that does not affect the ship&#x27;s survivability has been proposed.
===Construction===
All ten &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers were constructed between 1968 and 2006 at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia. The first three units of the class were erected in Dry Dock 11, the other seven ships were constructed in the largest dry dock in the western hemisphere, Dry Dock 12, now long after a recent expansion.

Beginning with , the aircraft carriers were manufactured with modular construction. This means that whole sections could be welded together with plumbing and electrical equipment already fitted, improving efficiency. The modules were lifted into the dry dock using gantry cranes and welded. In the case of the bow sections, these can weigh over . This method was originally developed by Ingalls Shipbuilding and increases the rate of work because much of the fitting out does not have to be carried out within the confines of the already-finished hull.

The total cost of construction for each ship was around $4.5 billion.

===Propulsion===
All ships of the class are powered by two A4W nuclear reactors, housed in separate compartments. The reactors produce heat through nuclear fission, which heats water to produce steam. This is then passed through four turbines, which are shared by the two reactors. A gearbox transmits power to four propeller shafts, producing a maximum speed of over and maximum power of . The turbines power the four bronze propellers, each with a diameter of and a weight of . Behind these are the two rudders, which are high and long, and each weighs .

The &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class ships constructed since also have bulbous bows to improve speed and fuel efficiency by reducing wave-making resistance. As a result of nuclear power, the ships are capable of operating continuously for over 20 years without refueling and are predicted to have a service life of over 50 years.

===Armament and protection===
In addition to the aircraft carried on board, the ships carry defensive equipment for use against missiles and hostile aircraft. These consist of either two or three RIM-7 Sea Sparrow or RIM-162 Evolved SeaSparrow Missile Mk 29 missile launchers designed for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as either three or four 20 mm Phalanx CIWS.

USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; has none of these, having been built with the Mk 49 Guided Missile Launching Systems for RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missiles, two of which have also been installed on and . These will be installed on the other ships as they return for Refueling Complex Overhaul (RCOH). Since USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, the carriers have been constructed with Kevlar armor over vital spaces, and earlier ships have been retrofitted with it: &quot;Nimitz&quot; in 1983–1984, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; from 1985 to 1987 and &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; in 1989.

The ships&#x27; other countermeasures are four Sippican SRBOC (super rapid bloom off-board chaff) six-barrel Mk 36 decoy launchers, which deploy infrared flares and chaff to disrupt the sensors of incoming missiles; an SSTDS torpedo defense system; and an AN/SLQ-25 Nixie torpedo countermeasures system. The carriers also use AN/SLQ-32(V) jamming systems to detect and disrupt hostile radar signals in addition to the electronic warfare capabilities of some of the aircraft on board.

The presence of nuclear weapons on board U.S. aircraft carriers since the end of the Cold War has neither been confirmed nor denied by the U.S. government. As a result, the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier in a foreign port has occasionally provoked protest from local people, for example, when &quot;Nimitz&quot; visited Chennai, India, in 2007. At that time, the Strike Group commander Rear Admiral John Terence Blake stated, &quot;The U.S. policy [...] is that we do not routinely deploy nuclear weapons on board &quot;Nimitz&quot;.&quot;

In May 2013, &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot; conducted the first carrier-borne end-to-end at-sea test of the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense System (SSTDS). The SSTDS combined the passive detection of the Torpedo Warning System (TWS) that finds, classifies, and tracks torpedoes with the hard-kill capability of a Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT), an encapsulated miniature torpedo designed to locate, home in on, and destroy hostile torpedoes. This was to increase protection against wake-homing torpedoes like the Type 53 that do not respond to acoustic decoys. The pieces of the SSTDS were engineered to locate and destroy incoming torpedoes in a matter of seconds; each system included one TWS and 8 CATs. Initial operational capability (IOC) was planned for 2019, and all aircraft carriers were to be outfitted by 2035. The Navy suspended work on the project in September 2018 due to poor reliability of the components; hardware, already installed on five carriers, is to be removed by 2023.

===Carrier air wing===

In order for a carrier to deploy, it must embark one of ten Carrier Air Wings (CVW). The carriers can accommodate a maximum of 130 F/A-18 Hornets or 85–90 aircraft of different types, but current numbers are typically 64 aircraft. Although the air wings are integrated with the operation of the carriers they are deployed to, they are regarded as separate entities. As well as the aircrew, the air wings are also made up of support personnel involved in roles including maintenance, aircraft and ordnance handling, and emergency procedures. Each person on the flight deck wears color-coded clothing to make their role easily identifiable.

A typical carrier air wing includes 36-48 F/A-18E or F Super Hornets as strike fighters, split between 3-4 squadrons; up to 12 F-35Cs, contributed by a squadron of Navy or Marine aviation; 4–8 EA-18G Growlers for electronic warfare; 4–6 E-2D Hawkeyes for airborne early warning (AEW), 1-3 C-2 Greyhounds used for logistics (to be replaced by CMV-22 Ospreys); and a Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron of 6–8 MH-60R and MH-60S Seahawks and &#x27;Knighthawks&#x27;, respectively. Marine F/A-18C or D Hornet squadrons are also sometimes deployed in place of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and/or F-35C squadrons. Future aircraft planned for operation from &quot;Nimitz&quot; and future classes of aircraft carrier include the MQ-25 Stingray, and two squadrons of F-35C, replacing a F/A-18E/F Super Hornet squadron. Aircraft previously operated from &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers include F-4 Phantoms, RA-5C Vigilantes, RF-8G Crusaders, F-14 Tomcats, S-3 Vikings, EA-3B Skywarriors, EA-6B Prowlers, A-7 Corsair II, and A-6E Intruder aircraft.

===Flight deck and aircraft facilities===
The flight deck is angled at nine degrees, which allows for aircraft to be launched and recovered simultaneously. This angle of the flight deck was reduced slightly compared to previous carriers, as the current design improves the airflow around the carrier. Four steam catapults are used to launch fixed-wing aircraft, and four arrestor wires are used for recovery. The two newest carriers, &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; and &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot;, have only three arrestor wires each, as the fourth was used infrequently on earlier ships and was therefore deemed unnecessary.

This CATOBAR arrangement allows for faster launching and recovery as well as a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship&#x27;s aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.

===Strike groups===

When an aircraft carrier deploys, it takes a Carrier Strike Group (CSG), made up of several other warships and supply vessels that allow the operation to be carried out. The armament of the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class is made up only of short-range defensive weapons, used as a last line of defense against enemy missiles and aircraft. As with all surface ships, an aircraft carrier is particularly vulnerable to attack from below, specifically from submarines. An aircraft carrier is a very expensive, hard to replace, and strategically valuable asset, and therefore it logically has immense value as a target.

As a result of its target value and vulnerability, aircraft carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long-range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including guided-missile cruisers and guided-missile destroyers, used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare, and frigates/guided-missile frigates, prior to their retirement from USN service. When the Navy commissions a new class of frigates (FFG(X)), they will again accompany CSGs. Also making up part of the group is one or two attack submarines for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship from Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support. The numbers and types of vessels that make up each strike group can vary from group to group, depending on deployments, mission, and availability.

===Design differences within the class===
While the designs of the last seven ships, beginning with &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, differ slightly from those of the earlier ships, the U.S. Navy considers all ten carriers a single class. When the older carriers come in for Refueling and Complex Overhaul (RCOH), their nuclear power plants are refueled, and they are upgraded to the standards of the later carriers. Other modifications may be performed to update the ships&#x27; equipment.

The ships were initially classified only as attack carriers but have been constructed with anti-submarine capabilities since &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;. These improvements include more advanced radar systems and facilities enabling the ships to operate aircraft in a more effective anti-submarine warfare role, including fitting common undersea picture (CUP) technology, which uses sonar to allow for better assessment of the threat from submarines.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; and later carriers have slight structural differences from the earlier &quot;Nimitz&quot; carriers, such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on &quot;George Washington&quot;, and the high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with &quot;John C. Stennis&quot;. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships to improve safety for crew members and aircraft.

The last carrier of the class, &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot;, was designed as a &quot;transition ship&quot; from the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class to the replacement . &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot; incorporates new technologies, including improved propeller and bulbous bow designs, a reduced radar cross-section, and electronic and environmental upgrades. The ship&#x27;s cost was $6.2 billion. The earlier &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class ships each cost around $4.5 billion. To lower costs, some new technologies and design features were also incorporated into USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;, the previous carrier, including a redesigned island.

==Ships in class==
The United States Navy lists the following ten ships in the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class:

==Service history==
===1975–1989===
One of the first major operations in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by &quot;Nimitz&quot; in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean in response to the taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Dwight D. Eisenhower&quot; relieved &quot;Nimitz&quot; in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;Nimitz&quot; conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship&#x27;s F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in what became known as the Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea, and &quot;Nimitz&quot; provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.

===1990–2000===
The two most significant deployments the &quot;Nimitz&quot; class was involved in during the 1990s were the Gulf War and its aftermath and Operation Southern Watch in southern Iraq. All active vessels were engaged in both of these to some extent, with Operation Southern Watch continuing until 2003. Most carriers in operation in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm played supporting roles, with only &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; playing an active part in combat operations.

Throughout the 1990s and more recently, &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers have been deployed as part of humanitarian missions. While deployed in the Gulf War, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was diverted to the Pacific Ocean to participate alongside 22 other ships in Operation Fiery Vigil, evacuating civilians following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo on Luzon Island in the Philippines. In October 1993, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; deployed to Somalia to assist UN humanitarian operations there, spending four weeks flying patrols around Mogadishu while supporting U.S. troops during Operation Restore Hope. The same ship also participated in Operation Vigilant Sentinel in the Persian Gulf in 1995.

&quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; flew patrols in support of the Kurds over northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort in 1991. In 1996, &quot;George Washington&quot; played a peacekeeping role in Operation Decisive Endeavor in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1999, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; was called to the Ionian Sea to support Operation Allied Force alongside other NATO militaries.

===2001–present===

&quot;Harry S. Truman&quot;″s maiden deployment was in November 2000. The carrier&#x27;s air wing flew 869 combat sorties in support of Operation Southern Watch, including a strike on Iraqi air defense sites on 16 February 2001, in response to Iraqi surface-to-air missile fire against United Nations coalition forces.

After the September 11 attacks, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; were among the first warships to participate in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; sailed towards the Persian Gulf intending to support Operation Southern Watch in July 2001. This changed in response to the attacks, and the ship changed course to travel towards the North Arabian Sea, where she launched the first airstrikes in support of the operation on 7 October 2001.

Following the attacks, &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; and &quot;George Washington&quot; participated in Operation Noble Eagle, carrying out homeland security operations off the West Coast of the United States. All active ships have been involved in Iraq and Afghanistan since that time. This included the invasion in 2003, as well as providing subsequent support for Operation Iraqi Freedom since then.

The carriers have also provided aid after natural disasters. In 2005, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; supported Operation Unified Assistance in Indonesia after the December 2004 tsunami, and &quot;Harry S. Truman&quot; provided aid after Hurricane Katrina later in 2005.

The &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; Carrier Strike Group performed humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations in the Philippines in June 2008 after Typhoon Fengshen, which killed hundreds from the central island regions and the main island of Luzon. In January 2010, &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; operated off Haiti, providing aid and drinking water to earthquake survivors as part of the U.S.-led Operation Unified Response, alongside other major warships and hospital ship .

===Refueling Complex Overhaul===
In order to refuel their nuclear power plants, the carriers each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This is also the most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels&#x27; equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in a dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out, including painting the hull below the waterline and replacing electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships&#x27; constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults, combat systems, and radar systems; precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about $2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling the nuclear power plants.

===Symbolic and diplomatic roles===
Because of their status as the largest warships in the U.S. Navy, the deployment of an aircraft carrier can fulfill a symbolic role, not just as a deterrent to an enemy but often as a diplomatic tool in strengthening relations with allies and potential allies. The latter of these functions can occur either as a single visit to a country, in which senior naval officers are allowed to observe the operation of the carrier and interact with its senior officers, or as part of an international task force. This can be in combat operations, such as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, or training deployments, such as Exercise RIMPAC. In addition, carriers have participated in international Maritime security operations, combating piracy in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia.

===Accidents and incidents===
On 26 May 1981, an EA-6B Prowler crashed on the flight deck of &quot;Nimitz&quot;, killing 14 crewmen and injuring 45 others. Forensic testing of the personnel involved showed that several tested positive for marijuana. While this was not found to have directly caused the crash, the investigation&#x27;s findings prompted the introduction of mandatory drug testing of all service personnel.

Pilots have been able to eject safely in several cases of ditched aircraft. However, fatal aircraft crashes have occurred; in 1994, Lieutenant Kara Hultgreen, the first female F-14 Tomcat pilot, was killed while attempting to land on board &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; during a training exercise.

Fires have also caused damage to the ships; in May 2008, while rotating through to her new homeport at Yokosuka Naval Base in Yokosuka, Japan, &quot;George Washington&quot; suffered a fire that cost $70 million in repairs, injured 37 sailors and led to the ship undergoing three months of repairs at San Diego; this led to its having to miss the 2008 RIMPAC exercises and delayed the final withdrawal from service of . The fire was caused by unauthorized smoking near improperly stored flammable refrigerant compressor oil.

==Future and planned replacement==
&quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carriers were initially designed to have a 50-year service life. At the end of their service life, ships will be decommissioned. This process will first take place on &quot;Nimitz&quot; and is estimated to cost from $750 to $900 million. This compares with an estimated $53 million for a conventionally powered carrier. Most of the difference in cost is attributed to the deactivation of the nuclear power plants and the safe removal of radioactive material and other contaminated equipment.

A new class of carriers, the &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class, is being constructed to replace previous vessels after decommissioning. Ten of these are expected, and the first has entered service as of 22 July 2017 to replace . Most of the rest of these new carriers are to replace the oldest &quot;Nimitz&quot; ships as they reach the end of their service lives. The new carriers will have a similar design to &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot; (using an almost identical hull shape) and technological and structural improvements.

The Navy reported in early 2022 that it was conducting a study to determine if the &quot;Nimitz&quot;-class carrier lives could be extended to as long as 55 years.

<text>Performance poetry is poetry that is specifically composed for or during a performance before an audience. It covers a variety of styles and genres.

==History==
The phenomenon of performance poetry, a kind of poetry specifically made for and offered during a performance before an audience goes back to Dada, the term itself only emerged later.
On June 23, 1916, Hugo Ball performed one of the first sound poems, &quot;Gadji beri bimba&quot; at the Cabaret Voltaire in Zürich, dressed in a cardboard costume so that he had to be carried onto the stage.
The actual birthplace of performance poetry is therefore Zürich. Since then the spectrum ranges from Kurt Schwitters’ own recitation of his wellknown &quot;Ursonate&quot; to the recitations of &quot;otto&#x27;s pug&quot; by German poet Ernst Jandl and a typ of performance that is mixed from impromptu speech, body language and theatricality such as Natias Neutert’s &quot;Diogenes Synopsis’’. 
The term &quot;performance poetry&quot; originates from an early press release describing the 1980s performance poet Hedwig Gorski, whose audio recordings achieved success on spoken word radio programs around the world. Her band, East of Eden Band, produced music and poetry collaborations, allowing cassettes of her live radio broadcast recordings to stay in rotation with popular underground music recordings on some radio stations. Gorski, an art school graduate, tried to come up with a term that would distinguish her text-based vocal performances from performance art, especially the work of performance artists, such as Laurie Anderson, who worked with music at that time.

Performance poets relied more on the rhetorical and philosophical expression in their poetics than performance artists, who arose from the visual art genres of painting and sculpture. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; newspaper, printing Gorski&#x27;s bi-weekly &quot;Litera&quot; column, first published the term &quot;performance poetry&quot; to describe the work of Gorski with composer D&#x27;Jalma Garnier III as early as 1982. She began using the term, however, to describe a 1978 &quot;neo-verse drama&quot; and &quot;conceptual spoken poetry for five voices&quot; titled &quot;Booby, Mama!&quot; that employs the cut-up method made popular by William Burroughs and conceptual art methods.

The National Endowment for the Arts categorized performance art within the visual arts judging panels; it originally placed performance poetry within the category of theater before correcting it to literature in the 21st century. Since many performance poets did not have publications, the former classification made performance poets categorically ineligible for the NEA fellowship funding or recognition. Their audio cassettes were not acceptable sample material for literature grant consideration. A stated objection to this presentation method protested their performance poems translated into text on paper could not compete with poetry written for print publication. The National Endowment for the Arts is now accepting varied presentations for publication verification for poetry fellowship applicants, including audio recordings that have no printed versions of the poems. Performance poetry with music peaked during the 1980s just as performance art peaked in the 1970s.

During that time, San Francisco and New York were the centers for this type of activity; however, Austin, Texas (The Third Coast) also had a thriving scene during the 1980s with a coterie of unique characters such as raúlrsalinas, Konstantyn K. Kuzminsky, Joy Cole, Hedwig Gorski, Roxy Gordon, Ricardo Sánchez and Harryette Mullen, who was nominated for the National Book Award. The Austin Poets Audio Anthology Project, a public arts project, recorded them for radio broadcasts. There were many others, though, and Hedwig Gorski once wrote in &quot;Litera&quot; that some were &quot;eerie&quot;, a word used by one newspaper reviewer to describe Gorski&#x27;s vocals on the East of Eden Band track &quot;There&#x27;s Always Something That Can Make You Happy&quot;. Other performing writers in the robust literary scene of the Austin area during that time when performance poetry turned into a school of poetry included Pat Littledog, Eleanor Crockett, Jim Ryan, Chuck Taylor, Greg Gauntner, Albert Huffstickler, W. Joe Hoppe, Andy Clausen, poet and playwright Isabella Russell-Ides (&quot;Getting Dangerously Close To Myself&quot;, Slough Press) and David Jewell (poet); most recorded on Hedwig Gorski&#x27;s audio anthology project.

Jewell deserves special mention as a transitional figure, younger than the aforementioned, and one not especially rooted in the Beats like Gorski who has strong connections to Ginsberg, Corso, Gary Snyder, and others. By the 1990s the general poetry public was less interested in the Beat Poets of the 1950s and 1960s. They were looking for something fresher, newer, hipper, more in touch with the times in which they were living. Performance poets established clubs, cafes, and media as venues that later became stages for the emerging slam poetry scene. Unlike Gorski, who with East of Eden Band, began broadcasting live performance poetry on radio and distributing the recordings of these broadcasts in place of publishing in print, Jewell and slam poets were more interested in small live audiences. Venues like Nuyorican Poets Cafe in New York City and mass media formats, like Gorski&#x27;s and John Giorno&#x27;s, form the two lines of influence leading to Def Poetry on HBO.

Performing poets-writers and especially performance poets excelled in the ability to put the event of oral literature into the primary social/communicative function for literature. The plurality of the literary performance is under the control of the poet/writer, and the performer never minimizes the participation of the audience members. Performance was the primary distribution method for poetics since tribal times and ancient Greece. As Gorski often states, broadcast and technology surpass books in reaching mass audiences for poetry, and just as writing poetry for print made poetry a completely different artform since the invention of the book, audio &quot;mediums influence the way poets write just as they do painters and sculptors&quot;.

Today, performance poetry is also being used as a means to promote literacy in public school systems. Global Writes Inc. has been incorporating technology, such as videoconferencing and podcasts, into literacy programs as a means for students to share their poetry. Performance poetry also provides avenues for students to perform their poems onstage.

Performance poetry is not solely a postmodern phenomenon. It began with the performance of oral poems in pre-literate societies. By definition, these poems were transmitted orally from performer to performer and were constructed using devices such as repetition, alliteration, rhyme and kennings to facilitate memorization and recall. The performer &quot;composed&quot; the poem from memory, using the version they had learned as a kind of mental template. This process allowed the performer to add their own flavor to the poem in question, although fidelity to the traditional versions of the poems was generally favored.

==Advent of printing==
Although popular works, including popular poems or collections of poems, were already being distributed for private reading and study in manuscript form, there can be little doubt that the introduction of cheap printing technologies accelerated this trend considerably. The result was a change in the poet&#x27;s role in society. From having been an entertainer, the poet became primarily a provider of written texts for private readings. The public performance of poetry became generally restricted, at least in a European context, to the staging of plays in verse and occasionally, for example in the cases of the Elizabethan madrigalists or Robert Burns, as texts for singing. Apart from this, the performance of poetry was restricted to reading aloud from printed books within families or groups of friends.

==20th century==
The early years of the 20th century saw a general questioning of artistic forms and conventions. Poets like Basil Bunting and Louis Zukofsky called for a renewed emphasis on poetry as sound. Bunting in particular argued that the poem on the page was like a musical score; not fully intelligible until manifested through sound. This attitude to poetry helped to encourage an environment in which poetry readings were fostered. This was reinforced by Charles Olson&#x27;s call for a poetic line based primarily on spoken human breath. Clive Sansom devoted much of his life to gathering and contributing poetry and drama particularly suited to performance by children.

During the 1950s, the American poet Cid Corman began to experiment with what he called oral poetry. This involved spontaneously composing poems into a tape recorder. Allen Ginsberg was to take up this practice in the 1960s. David Antin, who heard some of Corman&#x27;s tapes, took the process one step further. He composed his &quot;talk-poems&quot; by improvising in front of an audience. These performances were recorded and the tapes were later transcribed to be published in book form. Around the same time, Jerome Rothenberg was drawing on his ethnopoetic researches to create poems for ritual performances as happenings.

The writers of the Beat generation held performance events that married poetry and jazz. In the late 1960s, other poets outside San Francisco and New York City were experimenting with performance pieces. Notable among these was David Franks, at the time a faculty member at the Maryland Institute College of Art. Franks&#x27; work was not poetry recited to a musical counterpoint but literary pieces in which the performance was a necessary and integral part of the work itself.

In Britain, sound poets like Bob Cobbing and Edwin Morgan were exploring the possibilities of live performance. Cobbing&#x27;s groups Bird Yak and Konkrete Canticle involved collaborative performance with other poets and musicians and were partly responsible for drawing a number of the poets of the British Poetry Revival into the performance arena.

Meanwhile, many more mainstream poets in both Britain and the United States were giving poetry readings, largely to small academic gatherings on university campuses. Poetry readings were given national prominence when Robert Frost recited &quot;The Gift Outright&quot; from memory at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy.After that event, spoken word recordings of Frost and other major figures enjoyed increased popularity.

==The 1970s and after==
By the 1970s, three main forms of poetry performance had emerged. First was the poetry reading, at which poems that had been written for the page were read to an audience, usually by the author. Poetry readings have become widespread and poetry festivals and reading series are now part of the cultural landscape of most Western societies. However, most people would not consider the poetry readings of this type as part of the performance poetry phenomena.

This leaves two types of poetry performance: poems written specifically for performance on the Jerome Rothenberg model and poems like those of David Antin that are composed during performance. Both these types would generally be considered to constitute performance poetry. Another type based on the Beat method of reading their print poems is poetry with music. The bands with performance poets make spoken vocals an exercise in not singing, but the texts are not categorized as songs. While Ginsberg sang his Blake songs with a harmonium, the original practitioner of this third and most popular type of performance poetry is Hedwig Gorski, who coined the term performance poetry to describe her work with music. She is sometimes called a neo-beat, but considers herself an American &quot;futurist&quot;. Unlike the Beats, Ginsberg and Kerouac, her poems were written for performance with music that was specifically composed for the poems. Her spoken vocals have come as close to singing as possible without really singing. That is the key to Gorski&#x27;s performance poetry: the marriage of poetry to music written specifically to fit poems written for vocal performance. The other type of performance poetry Gorski practiced is without music and tied to conceptual art, but that was at appearances in smaller venues that could not accommodate her band. Unlike Antin and Cormin, Gorski never improvised text but wrote poetry only for performance while eschewing printed poetry.
In the U. S., the rise to prominence of the language poets with their distrust of speech as a basis for poetry has, broadly speaking, meant that performance poetry went out of fashion with the &quot;avant-garde&quot;. However, the increasing popularity of open mics, which allow &quot;unknown&quot; poets to take the stage and share their own work in 3- to 5-minute increments and of poetry slams has meant that performance poetry is now one of the most widespread forms of popular poetry. Chief among the proponents of these new forms of popular poetry were Bob Holman in New York, Marc Smith in Chicago and Alan Kaufman in San Francisco. In the 1990s, the Favorite Poem project of then U.S. Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky gave new visibility to ordinary Americans reading and performing their favorite poems. Contemporary performance poets are now experimenting with poetry performances adapted to CD, to video, and to Web audiences.

The Beat Poets were the first to popularize crossing over into recorded media to distribute their performed poetry. The best-known Beat poet, Allen Ginsberg, followed the lead of fellow Beat, Jack Kerouac, in reciting his work for audio recording. Ginsberg always used music with his readings and often accompanied himself on the harmonium. Ginsberg put William Blake&#x27;s poems to music and performed them with the harmonium. Even though the Beats did not use the term &quot;Performance Poetry&quot; to categorize their work with music and audio recordings, the Beats provided an immediate model for the work of Hedwig Gorski. She is a Nova Scotia College of Art and Design art school graduate in 1976. The art school was infamous for starting the careers of numerous 1970s performance artists, such as Vito Acconci, known for photographing his bites. It is worth noting that Gorski, who coined the term &quot;Performance Poetry&quot; to describe her poems written only for performance, recordings, and broadcast usually with her musical band East of Eden Band, is the only woman, besides Patti Smith, in this group of late twentieth-century innovators reviving oral poetry. Similar to the ancient bards, touring became a widespread means for performance poets and slammers to distribute their work since the 1990s. The Poetry Slam is a competitive live performance format founded by poet Marc Smith in Chicago, which has become a hotbed for performance poetry.

Performance poetry has also been boosted considerably by the appearance of Def Jam—the hip-hop recording company helmed by Russell Simmons—on the scene. def jam has created a television show that showcases performance poets that runs on HBO, as well as a show of performance poets that ran on Broadway for almost a year and won a Tony Award.

Hispanic performing artists, such as Pedro Pietri, Miguel Algarín, Giannina Braschi, and Guillermo Gómez-Peña, are known for their humorous and politically charged attacks against American imperialism. Later contemporary Latino poets such as Willie Perdomo, Edwin Torres (poet) and Caridad de la Luz would follow in this tradition.

Closely tied to Chicano poets is the Native American poet John Trudell who recorded and crossed over with his poetry and music cassettes. Trudell arose from the persecution on his reservation by FBI agents, who allegedly killed his wife and children. Protest is significant with the minority practitioners of performance poetry, such as def poets and slammers. This adds to the vitality of American performance poetry and connects to the social protest of Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg.

In France, :fr:Lucien Suel, Akenaton, and many other represents the way of performance poetry.

 is a Japanese poet and artist who takes the theatrical way of performance poetry since her debut in East Village in New York.

In the Czech Republic performance poetry has also become popular among both Czech speakers and expats living in the capital city, Prague, and surrounding areas. In 2002 the first expat-based performance poetry group Alchemy was established and regularly held open-mic poetry events until 2018. In 2003, the first year of the national slam poetry championship was organized as part of the Olomouc literary festival Poetry without Borders, initiated by poets and writers and and literary theorist Miroslav Balaštík.

In 2018 the Prague-based poetics collective was established by writers Tyko Say and Jeff Milton with the mission to make &quot;poetry readings more inclusive, inter-disciplinary and less restricted to art cafes and turtlenecks&quot;. The collective has since aimed to make poetry readings more similar to &quot;language happenings&quot; which involve a variety of interdisciplinary acts and performances occurring at the same time. The collective outlined twenty mantras in their manifesto to make performance poetry more of a singular happening.

==The United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, many &quot;avant-garde&quot; poets are deeply committed to live exposition of work, moving on from Cobbing and his peers. Well-known names include cris cheek and Aaron Williamson. The work of UK poet Michael Horovitz helped to spread this tradition in Britain during the early 1960s. His &quot;Live New Departures&quot; - a touring version of his poetry and arts journal &quot;New Departures&quot; (launched 1959) - gave space and opportunities to poets like Pete Brown and Adrian Mitchell who combined performed verse with the backing of jazz musicians like pianist Stan Tracey and saxophonist Bobby Wellins.

However, the emergence of performed poetry as a popular art form can probably be linked to Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s performance at the Albert Hall in 1965 at the International Poetry Incarnation. Horovitz, Brown and Mitchell would join Ginsberg and Beat colleagues Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso and other European poets at that landmark London occasion. These developments were also connected to the emergence of the Liverpool Poets, which referred mainly to the poets Roger McGough, Adrian Henri and Brian Patten who fired up audiences across the UK in the 70s and then the likes of John Hegley emerged in the 80s, influenced as much by stand-up comedy as a love for wordplay, creating the template for what became recognised as contemporary British performance poetry - a format still exemplified by the work of acts such as Murray Lachlan Young, Francesca Beard and Gerard McKeown.

Apples and Snakes, a collective promoting performance poetry in pubs and at festivals, was started by Mandy Williams, PR Murry and Jane Addison in London in 1982 inspired by the work of New Variety/CAST. They worked with &#x27;ranting poets&#x27; such as Attila the Stockbroker and Seething Wells and other poets and musicians with a political message such as Billy Bragg. Apples and Snakes continues today, 31 years later, as a national organisation. In the 90s, however, in big cities like Manchester and London, a different style emerged that was influenced more by hip hop with much less emphasis on comedy in the manner of Def Poets in the United States. Well-known writers from this evolution include Lemn Sissay and the late Dike Omeje from the Manchester scene and Roger Robinson and El Crisis from the London circuit.

On the experimental front, there has been fresh emphasis on collaborative choreographed stage work focused on poetry. &quot;ShadoWork&quot;, for instance, disrupts and enriches the conventional regimes of author, text and audience by combining (simple) theatrical movement with the full range of voice and stage in ways designed to draw deeper attention to the text. This represents a &#x27;counter-cultural&#x27; mode of performance poetry which shuns bald entertainment value. Other initiatives such as &quot;Lyrikal Fearta&quot; by Jonzi D have shaped street-based art for the stage, extending spoken word to short prose productions and fusing performance poetry with dance.

British performance poetry continues to thrive at a grassroots level, with performances in pubs and theatres, as well as at literary festivals and arts festivals such as Glastonbury and The Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Slams as well as open mics for more traditional writers remain popular. Media works influenced by radio performance poet Hedwig Gorski have gained ground; there has been some crossover into TV and radio. Many contemporary British performance poets have been influenced by punk poets like John Cooper Clarke and reggae poets like Linton Kwesi Johnson as well as by comedy and hip hop. In 2003 the first UK conference of performance poetry, organised by Lucy English, was held at Bath Spa University. Speakers included performing poets from the United States Bob Holman and Charles Bernstein. Bath Spa university runs a performance poetry module as part of its Creative Writing programme.

<doc id="181163" wikidata="Q2357179" url="?curid=181163" title="The Last Continent">
<text>The Last Continent is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the twenty-second book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series. First published in 1998, it mocks the aspects of time travel such as the grandfather paradox and the Ray Bradbury short story &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot;. It also parodies Australian people and aspects of Australian culture, such as &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; and &quot;Mad Max&quot; films, the Australian beer XXXX, Vegemite, thongs, cork hats, the Peach Melba, &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot;, the bushranger Ned Kelly, the Henley-on-Todd Regatta, and the Australian songs &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, &quot;Down Under&quot;, and &quot;The Man From Snowy River&quot;.

==Plot summary==

The story opens weeks after the events of &quot;Interesting Times&quot;, in which Rincewind is magically transported to the continent of XXXX. Here he meets the magical kangaroo Scrappy, who explains to Rincewind that he is fated to bring back the rain, and end the eons-long drought.

Meanwhile, the senior wizards are trying to find a cure for the Librarian&#x27;s magical malady, which causes him to transform into a native object, such as a book when near a library, whenever he sneezes. The Lecturer in Recent Runes suggests they interrogate Rincewind, as he once worked closely with the Librarian and seemed to know more about him than anyone else.

Back in the present, Rincewind ends up wrongfully arrested for sheep theft and taken to Bugarup, where he is hoping to find a ship to escape on. The people of Bugarup regard sheep thieves as folk heroes and encourage Rincewind to escape, while not actually allowing him to. He finds a hidden message on the ceiling of his holding cell, telling him: &quot;G&#x27;day mate, check the hinges.&quot; He discovers that he is able to lift the door off its hinges and escape.

After several comical misadventures, the University wizards reach Fourecks and meet the Creator of Fourecks. The Librarian meanwhile steals the Creator&#x27;s bullroarer and spins it, causing the drought Rincewind is in the process of stopping. The wizards are then frozen in time for thousands of years by the stray magic left over from creating the continent.

Rincewind, having escaped from gaol, meets up with two female impersonators, Darleen and Letitia, and a woman named Neilette. The &quot;ladies&quot; guide him to the University of Fourecks. Rincewind figures out how to free the wizards. The wizards attempt to find a way to bring back the rain, but are unsuccessful. As they are sitting around, Rincewind idly twirls the bullroarer, which soon begins to fly faster and farther than it should. Rincewind lets go and the bullroarer flies off; immediately, it begins to rain. Having saved Fourecks, Rincewind and the wizards return to Ankh-Morpork by ship.

==Reception==
The &quot;SF Site&quot; described it as &quot;(l)oads of sarcasm, an outrageous plot and tons of sheer fun&quot;. &quot;Infinity Plus&quot; was less positive, recommending that &quot;Discworld&quot; newcomers start elsewhere, and stating that it &quot;falls below (Pratchett&#x27;s) normal very high standard on several counts&quot;, because although it is &quot;great fun&quot; and &quot;worth buying&quot;, it &quot;doesn&#x27;t hang together as a plot, as an unfolding story&quot;.

<text>Caspar Rudolph [[Ritter von]] Jhering (; also Ihering; 22 August 1818 – 17 September 1892) was a German jurist. He is best known for his 1872 book &quot;Der Kampf ums Recht&quot; (&quot;The Struggle for Law&quot;), as a legal scholar, and as the founder of a modern sociological and historical school of law. His ideas were important to the subsequent development of the &quot;jurisprudence of interests&quot; in Germany.

==Life and career==
Jhering was born on 22 August 1818 in Aurich, the Kingdom of Hanover. He entered the University of Heidelberg in 1836 and also studied in Göttingen, Munich, and starting 1838 in Berlin, where he earned his PhD. Of all his teachers, Georg Friedrich Puchta was the most influential one to him.

In 1844, after graduating as a &quot;doctor juris&quot;, Jhering established himself in Berlin as &quot;Privatdozent&quot; for Roman law, and delivered public lectures on the &quot;Geist des römischen Rechts&quot; (Spirit of Roman law), the theme that may be said to have constituted his life&#x27;s work. In 1845, he became an ordinary professor at the University of Basel, in 1846 at Rostock, in 1849 at Kiel, and in 1851 at Giessen. He left his mark at each of those seats of learning; beyond any other of his contemporaries he animated the dry bones of Roman law.

In that period, the German juristic world was still under the dominating influence of Savigny. The older school looked askance at the young professor, who attempted to build up a system of jurisprudence based on natural justice. This is the keynote of his famous work, &quot;Geist des römischen Rechts auf den verschiedenen Stufen seiner Entwicklung&quot; (The spirit of Roman law at the various stages of its development, 1852–1865). Its originality and lucidity placed its author in the forefront of modern Roman jurists.

In the second half of the 19th century, Jhering&#x27;s reputation was as high as that of Savigny&#x27;s in the first half. Their methods were almost diametrically opposed. Savigny and his school represented a historical approach. Jhering&#x27;s conception of jurisprudence was as a science to be utilized for the further advancement of the moral and social interests of mankind.

In 1868, Jhering accepted the chair of Roman Law at Vienna, where his lecture-room was not only crowded with regular students but also men of all professions and even high-ranking officials. In 1872 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria conferred a title of hereditary nobility upon him.

The social functions of the Austrian metropolis became wearisome, and Jhering gladly exchanged it for the repose of Göttingen, where he became professor in 1872. That year, he had read a lecture in Vienna before an admiring audience, published under the title of &quot;Der Kampf um&#x27;s Recht&quot; (1872; Eng. trans., &quot;The Struggle for Law&quot;, 1879). Its success was extraordinary. Within two years it attained twelve editions, and it has been translated into 26 languages. In this, his most famous work, Jhering based his theory of duty in the maintenance of one&#x27;s rights, firstly, on the connection between rights and personality; and secondly, on the solidarity of law and rights. The relationship of rights to personality is explored. Our rights involve a parcel of our social worth, our honor. Whoever violates our rights, attacks our worth, our honor.

This work was followed five years later by &quot;Der Zweck im Recht&quot; (The Purpose in Law, 2 volumes, 1877–1883). These two works reflect Jhering&#x27;s individuality. The &quot;Kampf ums Recht&quot; shows the firmness of his character, the strength of his sense of justice, and his juristic method and logic: every responsible person owes a duty to himself to assert his rights. The &quot;Zweck im Recht&quot; evidences the bent of the author&#x27;s intellect. But perhaps the happiest combination of all his distinctive characteristics is to be found in his &quot;Jurisprudenz des täglichen Lebens&quot; (1870; Eng. trans., 1904). A great feature of his lectures was his so-called &quot;Praktika&quot;, problems in Roman law, and a collection of these with hints for solution was published as early as 1847 under the title &quot;Civilrechtsfalle ohne Entscheidungen&quot;.

Aside from shorter positions at Leipzig and Heidelberg, Jhering continued to work in Göttingen until his death on 17 September 1892.

His other works include the following: &quot;Beiträge zur Lehre vom Besitz&quot;, first published in the &quot;Jahrbücher für die Dogmatik des heutigen römischen und deutschen Privatrechts&quot;, and then separately; &quot;Der Besitzwille&quot;, and an article entitled &quot;Besitz&quot; in the &quot;Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften&quot; (1891), which aroused much controversy at the time, particularly on account of the opposition manifested to Savigny&#x27;s conception of the subject.

Jhering was married to Ida Christina Frölich. His oldest son was the German-Brazilian zoologist Hermann von Ihering (1850–1930). He was also the great-great-grandfather of Australian singer and actress Olivia Newton-John through his daughter Helene Ehrenberg and her marriage to the German jurist Victor Ehrenberg.

Jhering was elected a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1874.

See also &quot;Scherz und Ernst in der Jurisprudenz&quot; (1885); &quot;Das Schuldmoment im römischen Privatrecht&quot; (1867); &quot;Das Trinkgeld&quot; (1882); and among the papers he left behind him his &quot;Vorgeschichte der Indoeuropaer&quot;, a fragment, was published by Victor Ehrenberg in 1894.

In October 2018, the bicentenary of Jhering was commemorated by scholars of Roman law from several countries.

<text>Loreto ( , , ) is a hill town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Italian province of Ancona, in the Marche region. It is most commonly known as the seat of the Basilica della Santa Casa, a popular Catholic pilgrimage site.

==Location==

Loreto is located above sea level on the right bank of the Musone river and by rail south-southeast of Ancona; like many places in the Marche, it provides good views from the Apennines to the Adriatic.

==Main sights==

The city&#x27;s main monuments occupy the four sides of the piazza: the college of the Jesuits; the Palazzo Comunale (formerly the Palazzo Apostolico), designed by Bramante, that houses an art gallery with works of Lorenzo Lotto, Vouet and Annibale Carracci as well as a collection of maiolica, and the Shrine of the Holy House (&quot;Santuario della Santa Casa&quot;). It also boasts a massive line of walls, designed by the architect (and military engineer) Antonio da Sangallo the Younger, which were erected from 1518 and reinforced in the 17th century.

==Gallery==
==Twin towns and sister cities==

Loreto is twinned with:

* Mariazell, Austria

<doc id="181169" wikidata="Q1071960" url="?curid=181169" title="Sand dollar">
<text>Sand dollars (also known as sea cookies or snapper biscuits in New Zealand and Brazil, or pansy shells in South Africa) are species of flat, burrowing sea urchins belonging to the order Clypeasteroida. Some species within the order, not quite as flat, are known as sea biscuits. Sand dollars can also be called &quot;sand cakes&quot; or &quot;cake urchins&quot;.

==Names==
The term &quot;sand dollar&quot; derives from the appearance of the tests (skeletons) of dead individuals after being washed ashore. The test lacks its velvet-like skin of spines and has often been bleached white by sunlight. To beachcombers of the past, this suggested a large, silver coin, such as the old Spanish dollar, which had a diameter of 38–40 mm.

Other names for the sand dollar include sand cakes, pansy shells, snapper biscuits, cake urchins, and sea cookies. In South Africa, they are known as pansy shells from their suggestion of a five-petaled garden flower. The Caribbean sand dollar or inflated sea biscuit, &quot;Clypeaster rosaceus&quot;, is thicker in height than most. In Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas, the sand dollar is most often known as &quot;&quot; (sea cookie); the translated term is often encountered in English.

In the folklore of Georgia in the United States, sand dollars were believed to represent coins lost by mermaids.

==Description==

Sand dollars diverged from the other irregular echinoids, namely the cassiduloids, during the early Jurassic, with the first true sand dollar genus, &quot;Togocyamus&quot;, arising during the Paleocene. Soon after &quot;Togocyamus&quot;, more modern-looking groups emerged during the Eocene.

Sand dollars are small in size, averaging from 80 to 100 mm (3 to 4 inches). As with all members of the order Clypeasteroida, they possess a rigid skeleton called a test. The test consists of calcium carbonate plates arranged in a fivefold symmetric pattern. The test of certain species of sand dollar have slits called lunules that can help the animal stay embedded in the sand to stop it from being swept away by an ocean wave. In living individuals, the test is covered by a skin of velvet-textured spines which are covered with very small hairs (cilia). Coordinated movements of the spines enable sand dollars to move across the seabed. The velvety spines of live sand dollars appear in a variety of colors—green, blue, violet, or purple—depending on the species. Individuals which are very recently dead or dying (moribund) are sometimes found on beaches with much of the external morphology still intact. Dead individuals are commonly found with their empty test devoid of all surface material and bleached white by sunlight.

The bodies of adult sand dollars, like those of other echinoids, display radial symmetry. The petal-like pattern in sand dollars consists of five paired rows of pores. The pores are perforations in the endoskeleton through which podia for gas exchange project from the body. The mouth of the sand dollar is located on the bottom of its body at the center of the petal-like pattern. Unlike other urchins, the bodies of sand dollars also display secondary front-to-back bilateral symmetry with no morphological distinguishing features between males and females. The anus of sand dollars is located at the back rather than at the top as in most urchins, with many more bilateral features appearing in some species. These result from the adaptation of sand dollars, in the course of their evolution, from creatures that originally lived their lives on top of the seabed (epibenthos) to creatures that burrow beneath it (endobenthos).

==Behavior and habitat==

Sand dollars can be found in temperate and tropical zones along all continents. Sand dollars live in waters below the mean low tide line, on or just beneath the surface of sandy and muddy areas. The common sand dollar, &quot;Echinarachnius parma&quot;, can be found in the Northern Hemisphere from the intertidal zone to the depths of the ocean, while the keyhole sand dollars (three species of the genus &quot;Mellita&quot;) can be found on many a wide range of coasts in and around the Caribbean Sea.

The spines on the somewhat flattened topside and underside of the animal allow it to burrow or creep through the sediment when looking for shelter or food. Fine, hair-like cilia cover these tiny spines. Sand dollars usually eat algae and organic matter found along the ocean floor, though some species will tip on their side to catch organic matter floating in ocean currents.

Sand dollars frequently gather on the ocean floor, in part to their preference for soft bottom areas, which are convenient for their reproduction. The sexes are separate and, as with most echinoids, gametes are released into the water column and go through external fertilization. The nektonic larvae metamorphose through several stages before the skeleton or test begins to form, at which point they become benthic.

In 2008, biologists discovered that sand dollar larvae will clone themselves for a few different reasons. When a predator is near, certain species of sand dollar larvae will split themselves in half in a process they use to asexually clone themselves when sensing danger. The cloning process can take up to 24 hours and creates larvae that are 2/3 their original length which can help conceal them from the predator. The larvae of these sand dollars clone themselves when they sense dissolved mucus from a predatory fish. The larvae exposed to this mucus from the predatory fish respond to the threat by cloning themselves. This process doubles their population and halves their size which allows them to better escape detection by the predatory fish but may make them more vulnerable to attacks from smaller predators like crustaceans. Sand dollars will also clone themselves during normal asexual reproduction. Larvae will undergo this process when food is plentiful or temperature conditions are optimal. Cloning may also occur to make use of the tissues that are normally lost during metamorphosis.

The flattened test of the sand dollar allows it to burrow into the sand and remain hidden from sight from potential predators. Predators of the sand dollar are the fish species cod, flounder, sheepshead and haddock. These fish will prey on sand dollars even through their tough exterior.

Sand dollars have spines on their bodies that help them to move around the ocean floor. When a sand dollar dies, it loses the spines and becomes smooth as the exoskeleton is then exposed.

<doc id="181171" wikidata="Q76336" url="?curid=181171" title="Nicolaus Zinzendorf">
<text>Nikolaus Ludwig, [[Reichsgraf]] von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (26 May 1700 – 9 May 1760) was a German religious and social reformer, bishop of the Moravian Church, founder of the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeine, Christian mission pioneer and a major figure of 18th-century Protestantism.

Born in Dresden, Zinzendorf was often influenced by strong and vehement feelings, and he was easily moved both by sorrow and joy. Called Ludwig or Brother Ludwig by his intimates, he was a natural orator, and though his dress was simple his personal appearance gave an impression of distinction and force. He was notable for providing shelter for German-speaking Moravian exiles at Herrnhut, an effort that was influenced by Pietist ideas from the Lutheran faith he was brought up in.

Zinzendorf was critical of slavery, and played a role in starting the Protestant mission movement by supporting two determined Moravian missionaries Johann Leonhard Dober and David Nitschmann to go (via Copenhagen) to the Danish colony of Saint Thomas to minister to the enslaved population there (see &quot;Moravian slaves&quot;). In spite of having Danish royal support from Charlotte Amalie of Denmark, these missionaries faced discouragement in several forms, including by some Moravians at Herrnhut (including Christian David), by the Danish West India Company, by planters in Saint Thomas, by the risk of getting malaria, and by the slaves themselves.

His projects were often misunderstood. In 1736 he was banished from Saxony, but in 1749 the government rescinded its decree and begged him to establish within its jurisdiction more settlements like that at Herrnhut.

Zinzendorf&#x27;s effect on the Moravian Church was significant, and is still evident nearly three centuries later. He is commemorated as a hymnwriter and a renewer of the church by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on its Calendar of Saints on 9 May.

==Early life and ancestry==
Born into one of the most prominent noble families of the region, House of Zinzendorf, Nicolaus (also Nikolaus) was the only son of Count Georg Ludwig von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf (1662–1700) by his second wife, Baroness Charlotte Justina von Gersdorff (1675–1763), daughter of Nicolaus, Baron von Gersdorff (1629–1702), Governor of the Saxon Upper Lusatia and Henrietta Catharina von Friesen-Roetha. From his father&#x27;s first marriage to Baroness Maria Elisabeth Teuffel von Gundersdorf (1661–1698), Nicolaus had one half-sister, Countess Susanne Louise von Ortenburg (1690–1709), and one half-brother Count Friedrich Christian (1696–1756), who was the father of Count Karl von Zinzendorf, Governor of Trieste.

==Formative years==

At age six, young Ludwig would often write love letters to Jesus. He would then climb to the castle tower and toss them out the window, where they scattered around the courtyard like innocent prayers. During the Great Northern War, Swedish soldiers overran Saxony in 1706. They entered the room where young Ludwig just happened to be conducting his customary devotions. The soldiers were incredibly moved by the boy&#x27;s prayer.

His school days were spent at Franke Foundations at Halle where Pietism was strong, and in 1716, he went to the University of Wittenberg, to study law so as to be ready for a diplomatic career. Three years later, he traveled in the Netherlands, in France, and in various parts of Germany, where he made the personal acquaintance of men distinguished for practical goodness and belonging to a variety of churches. During a visit to an art museum, Zinzendorf was said to have experienced the Holy Spirit upon viewing &quot;Ecce Homo&quot; by Domencia Feti. Young Zinzendorf was converted, noting: &quot;I have loved Him for a long time, but I have never actually done anything for Him. From now on I will do whatever He leads me to do.&quot;

==Religious freedom and discord==
In 1722, Zinzendorf offered asylum to a number of persecuted wanderers from Moravia and Bohemia (parts of Czech Republic today), and permitted them to build the village of Herrnhut on a corner of his estate of Berthelsdorf. Most of the initial refugees who came to this asylum were recruited by Christian David and came from areas where the early Protestant groups such as the Unitas Fratrum had been dominant prior to the Thirty Years&#x27; War. As the village grew it became known as a place of religious freedom, and attracted individuals from a variety of persecuted groups, including the Schwenkfelders. The concentration of differing beliefs in the village produced intense conflict. Personal and religious differences between the estate manager Heitz and Johann Andreas Rothe, the Lutheran pastor of Berthelsdorf, were made more tense by the apocalyptic preaching of Johann Sigismund Krüger.

Zinzendorf began to visit each home for prayer, and finally called the men of the village together for an intense study of the Scriptures. The question they came to focus on was how the Scriptures described Christian life in community. These studies, combined with intense prayer, convinced many of the community that they were called to live together in love, and that the disunity and conflict they had experienced was contrary to the clear calling of Scripture.

==Reconciliation and the Brotherly Agreement==
Out of this study and prayer, the community formed a document known as the &quot;Brüderlicher Vertrag&quot;, the Brotherly Agreement, a voluntary discipline of Christian community. This document, and a set of rules laid down by Zinzendorf known as The Manorial Injunctions, were signed by the members of the community on 12 May 1727. This document, which has been revised over many years, is today known as &quot;The Moravian Covenant for Christian Living.&quot; The Moravian Church is one of the few denominations that emphasizes a code of Christian behavior over specific creeds.

Continued study and prayer in small groups known as &quot;banden&quot; resulted in a sense of reconciliation in the community, leading to a powerful spiritual renewal on 13 August 1727 during a special communion service at the Berthelsdorf Church. This experience, referred to as the &quot;Moravian Pentecost,&quot; marked the beginning of a new era of spiritual growth in Herrnhut. It also began a period of radical experimentation with communal Christian living as expressed in Zinzendorf&#x27;s theology.

==Reconnection with early &quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot;==
As the renewed community of Herrnhut grew, Zinzendorf obtained a copy of &quot;Ratio Disciplinae&quot;, the church order of the early Bohemian Unity. As he began to study the history of the Bohemians, he was astonished to find powerful similarities between the theology and practice of the early &quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot; and the newly established order of Herrnhut. Zinzendorf and the Herrnhuters felt a strong identification with the writings of Moravian Bishop John Amos Comenius and incorporated many of the ideas of the early Unity. However, Zinzendorf saw the new group as a spark for renewal of all denominations, not a new and separate denomination. This theological bent was reinforced by the legal structure of the Lutheran state church.

==New Protestant family order==
In this renewed community, Zinzendorf was able to organize the people into something similar to a &quot;militia Christi&quot;, based not on monastic but on family life. However his ideas of family were centered not on a traditional nuclear family of parents and children. Indeed, he wanted to break traditional family bonds by organizing communal families based on age, marital status and gender. The &quot;banden&quot;, or small groups, continued but were organized into &quot;choirs&quot; based on age, marital status, and gender. Zinzendorf&#x27;s theology recognized that at each stage of life, we had different spiritual needs and a different relationship with the Savior.

Zinzendorf was consecrated a bishop at Berlin on 20 May 1737 by Bishops David Nitschmann der Bischof and Daniel Ernst Jablonski.

==Missionaries and the Pilgrim Count==

In 1732, the community began sending out missionaries among slaves in the Danish-governed West Indies and the Inuit of Greenland. Zinzendorf&#x27;s personal and familial relation to the court of Denmark and to King Christian VI facilitated such endeavors. He saw with delight the spread of this Protestant family order in Germany, Denmark, Russia and England.

In 1736, accusations from neighboring nobles and questions of theological unorthodoxy caused Zinzendorf to be exiled from his home in Saxony. He and a number of his followers moved to Marienborn (near Büdingen) and began a period of exile and travel, during which he became known as the &quot;Pilgrim Count.&quot;

The missionary work in the West Indies had been hugely controversial in Europe, with many accusing Zinzendorf of simply sending young missionaries off to die. He decided to place himself on the line, and in 1739 left Europe to visit the mission work on St. Thomas. Convinced that he himself might not come back, he preached his &quot;last sermon&quot; and left his will with his wife.

In 1741, Zinzendorf visited Pennsylvania, thus becoming one of the few 18th century European nobles to have actually set foot in the Americas. In addition to visiting leaders in Philadelphia such as Benjamin Franklin, he met with the leaders of the Iroquois and, with the assistance of Conrad Weiser reached agreements for the free movement of Moravian missionaries in the area.

==Theology==

He taught that the Savior had a relationship with each believer, but a different level of relationship with the &quot;Gemeinde&quot;. Decisions on interpretation of Scripture were to be made communally, not individually. He believed it was the &quot;Gemeinde&quot;, not the ecclesiastical and political institution, that was truly the Church of Jesus Christ.

His famous preaching of the redemption through the blood of Christ, followed a change of opinion around 1734/35, the years before it was suspected he had adhered to the opposite doctrines of Johann Conrad Dippel.

More scandalously, he had his secret or half-public doctrines, most notably of the &quot;Holy marriage&quot; or &quot;Marriage-Sacrament&quot;. In his first big song-book, &quot;Sammlung Geist- und lieblicher Lieder&quot;, Herrnhut 1731, in the preface p. 16, he states a holy marriage as a sacrament together with the baptism and Lord&#x27;s Supper. This means that man and wife who live in such a marriage are sinless. The doctrines of this were especially given out to the married couples of the congregation in the count&#x27;s speeches, notably in his 1747 edited: &quot;Oeffentliche Gemeinreden&quot;, 2. Vols., and in the 1755 at Frankfurt and Leipzig published (by a local Saxon clergyman who had got hold of the manuscript): &quot;Haupt-Schlüssel zum herrnhutischen Ehe-Sacrament&quot;.
From 1735 on, in public writings, Z. expressly declared himself for the lutheran confession of Augsburg, but in private letters he declared indifference to any confession; that is, the Catholic, Reformed and Lutheran churches as &quot;sects&quot; called, that is an adherence to Jesus Christ without any doctrine, and finally his own church as the center of this, and including threats to those who would oppose him. In a letter to some separatists outside Frankfurt M, of 16. June 1736 he states:
&quot;Wir haben Lust, Seelen zu JEsu zu bereden, in allen Secten und Verfassungen. Denn wir machen keine neue, sondern leben in JESU gemein, die allenthalben nur eine ist. Will man uns dieses in Liebe lassen, so so lassen wir wieder stehen, was wir nicht gebauet. Wil man uns aber darinnen stören; so werden wir uns mit dem Schwerdt des Geistes zur Rechten und zur Lincken Platz machen. (We have desire, to prepare souls to Jesus, in all sects and constitutions. Then we make no new ones, but live in the congregation of Jesus, which everywhere only one is. Would one let this in love, so will we leave standing, what we did not build. But if one will disturb this; so will we right and left make place with the sword of spirit.)&quot; Such utterances carried the double appearance of theological toleration and dictatorship. Which Jesus he is referring to, is also unclear, because it is a Jesus without certain content. The theology that emerged from all the controversies, was a ceremonial, liturgical one.
An original English account (from Z. visit in North America) of Count Z. opinions can be found in: Gilbert Tennent: &quot;Some account of the Principles of the Moravians&quot;, London 1743.

==Declining years==
By 1741 his daughter, Maria Theresa, had died and he decided to adopt a replacement. He chose an heiress, Mary Stonehouse, whom he renamed Maria Theresa. She had been married for two years to an estranged Anglican vicar. She joined the Moravian church in 1742 and served as a worker as a patron and deaconess within his household. Her husband had a more difficult relationship with the church.

A financial board was established among the Brethren, on a plan furnished by lawyer John Frederick Köber, which worked well. His son Christian Renatus, whom Zinzendorf had hoped to make his successor, died in 1752 of tuberculosis.

==Works==
He wrote a large number of hymns, of which the best-known is &quot;Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness&quot;.

<text>The Airbus A380 is a very large wide-body airliner, developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world&#x27;s largest passenger airliner and the only full-length double-deck jet airliner. 

Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994 and Airbus launched the €–billion ($10.7–billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, commencing its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006.

Due to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled. It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in both 2012 and 2014, with manufacturing of the aircraft ending in 2021. The A380&#x27;s estimated $25 billion development cost was not recouped by the time Airbus ended production.
The full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of . , the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses. , there were 189 aircraft in service with 10 operators worldwide. Five airlines have fully retired the A380 from their fleets.

==Development==
===Background===


In mid-1988, Airbus engineers, led by Jean Roeder, began work in secret on the development of an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA), both to complete its own range of products and to break the dominance that Boeing had enjoyed in this market segment since the early 1970s with its Boeing 747. McDonnell Douglas unsuccessfully offered its double-deck MD-12 concept for sale. Lockheed was exploring the possibility for a Very Large Subsonic Transport. Roeder was given approval for further evaluations of the UHCA after a formal presentation to the President and CEO in June 1990.

The megaproject was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow, with the stated goal of 15% lower operating costs than the Boeing 747-400. Airbus organised four teams of designers, one from each of its partners (Aérospatiale, British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace AG, CASA) to propose new technologies for its future aircraft designs. The designs were presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs were used. In January 1993, Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport (VLCT), aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market.

In June 1994, Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner, designated as A3XX. Airbus considered several designs, including an unusual side-by-side combination of two fuselages from its A340, the largest Airbus jet at the time. The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing&#x27;s own New Large Aircraft successor to the 747. In July 1995, the joint study with Boeing was abandoned, as Boeing&#x27;s interest had declined due to analysis that such a product was unlikely to cover the projected $15 billion development cost. Despite the fact that only two airlines had expressed public interest in purchasing such a plane, Airbus was already pursuing its own large-plane project. Analysts suggested that Boeing would instead pursue stretching its 747 design, and that air travel was already moving away from the hub-and-spoke system that consolidated traffic into large planes, and toward more non-stop routes that could be served by smaller planes.
From 1997 to 2000, as the 1997 Asian financial crisis darkened the market outlook, Airbus refined its design, targeting a 15–20% reduction in operating costs over the existing Boeing 747-400. The A3XX design converged on a double-decker layout that provided more passenger volume than a traditional single-deck design. Airbus did so in line with traditional hub-and-spoke theory, as opposed to the point-to-point theory with the Boeing 777, after conducting an extensive market analysis with over 200 focus groups. Although early marketing of the huge cross-section touted the possibility of duty-free shops, restaurant-like dining, gyms, casinos and beauty parlours on board, the realities of airline economics have kept such dreams grounded.

On 19 December 2000, the supervisory board of newly restructured Airbus voted to launch a € billion ($10.7 billion) project to build the A3XX, re-designated as A380, with 50 firm orders from six launch customers. The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families, which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340. It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double-deck cross section, and is a lucky number in many East Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed. The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001, and manufacturing of the first A380 wing-box component started on 23 January 2002. The development cost of the A380 had grown to €11–14 billion when the first aircraft was completed.

=== Total development cost ===
In 2000, the projected development cost was €9.5 billion. In 2004, Airbus estimated that €1.5 billion ($2 billion) would need to be added, totalling the developmental costs to €10.3 billion ($12.7 billion). In 2006, Airbus stopped publishing its reported cost after reaching costs of €10.2 billion and then it provisioned another €4.9 billion, after the difficulties in electric cabling and two years delay for an estimated total of €18 billion.
In 2014, the aircraft was estimated to have cost $25bn (£16bn, €bn) to develop. In 2015, Airbus said development costs were €15 billion (£11.4 billion, $ billion), though analysts believe the figure is likely to be at least €5bn ($ Bn) more for a €20 Bn ($ Bn) total. In 2016, The A380 development costs were estimated at $25 billion for 15 years, $25–30 billion, or €25 billion ($28 billion).

To start the programme in 2000, the governments of France, Germany and the UK loaned Airbus 3.5 billion euros and refundable advances reached 5.9 billion euros ($7.3 billion).
In February 2018, after an Emirates order secured production of the unprofitable programme for ten years, Airbus revised its deal with the three loan-giving governments to save $1.4 billion (17%) and restructured terms to lower the production rate from eight per year in 2019 to six per year.

On 15 May 2018, in its EU appeal ruling, a WTO ruling concluded that the A380 received improper subsidies through $9 billion of launch aids, but Airbus acknowledged that the threat posed to Boeing by the A380 is so marginal with 330 orders since its 2000 launch that any U.S. sanctions should be minimal, as previous rulings showed Boeing&#x27;s exposure could be as little as $377 million.
In 2018, unit cost was .

In February 2019, the German government disclosed that it was conducting talks with Airbus regarding €600 million in outstanding loans. Following the decision to wind down the A380 programme, Europe argues that the subsidies in effect no longer exist and that no sanctions are warranted.

===Production===
Major structural sections of the A380 are built in France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Due to the sections&#x27; large size, traditional transportation methods proved unfeasible, so they are taken to the &quot;Jean-Luc Lagardère Plant&quot; assembly hall in Toulouse, France, by specialised road and water transportation, though some parts are moved by the A300-600ST &quot;Beluga&quot; transport aircraft. A380 components are provided by suppliers from around the world; the four largest contributors, by value, are Rolls-Royce, Safran, United Technologies and General Electric.

For the surface movement of large A380 structural components, a complex route known as the Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit was developed. This involved the construction of a fleet of roll-on/roll-off (RORO) ships and barges, the construction of port facilities and the development of new and modified roads to accommodate oversized road convoys. The front and rear fuselage sections are shipped on one of three RORO ships from Hamburg in northern Germany to Saint-Nazaire in France. The ship travels via Mostyn, Wales, where the wings are loaded. The wings are manufactured at Broughton in North Wales, then transported by barge to Mostyn docks for ship transport.

In Saint-Nazaire, the ship exchanges the fuselage sections from Hamburg for larger, assembled sections, some of which include the nose. This ship unloads in Bordeaux. It then goes to pick up the belly and tail sections from Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA in Cádiz, Spain, and delivers them to Bordeaux. From there, the A380 parts are transported by barge to Langon, and by oversize road convoys to the assembly hall in Toulouse. To avoid damage from direct handling, parts are secured in custom jigs carried on self-powered wheeled vehicles.

After assembly, the aircraft are flown to the Airbus Hamburg-Finkenwerder plant to be furnished and painted. Airbus sized the production facilities and supply chain for a production rate of four A380s per month.

===Testing===

In 2005, five A380s were built for testing and demonstration purposes. The first A380, registered F-WWOW, was unveiled in Toulouse 18 January 2005. It first flew on 27 April 2005. This plane, equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, flew from Toulouse–Blagnac Airport with a crew of six headed by chief test pilot Jacques Rosay. Rosay said flying the A380 had been &quot;like handling a bicycle&quot;.

On 1 December 2005, the A380 achieved its maximum design speed of Mach 0.96, (its design cruise speed is Mach 0.85) in a shallow dive. In 2006, the A380 flew its first high-altitude test at Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. It conducted its second high-altitude test at the same airport in 2009. On 10 January 2006, it flew to José María Córdova International Airport in Colombia, accomplishing the transatlantic testing, and then it went to El Dorado International Airport to test the engine operation in high-altitude airports. It arrived in North America on 6 February 2006, landing in Iqaluit, Nunavut, in Canada for cold-weather testing.
On 14 February 2006, during the destructive wing strength certification test on MSN5000, the test wing of the A380 failed at 145% of the limit load, short of the required 150% level. Airbus announced modifications adding 30 kg (66 lb) to the wing to provide the required strength. On 26 March 2006, the A380 underwent evacuation certification in Hamburg. With 8 of the 16 exits randomly blocked, 853 mixed passengers and 20 crew exited the darkened aircraft in 78 seconds, less than the 90 seconds required for certification. Three days later, the A380 received European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to carry up to 853 passengers.

The first A380 using GP7200 engines—serial number MSN009 and flew on 25 August 2006. On 4 September 2006, the first full passenger-carrying flight test took place. The aircraft flew from Toulouse with 474 Airbus employees on board, in a test of passenger facilities and comfort. In November 2006, a further series of route-proving flights demonstrated the aircraft&#x27;s performance for 150 flight hours under typical airline operating conditions. , the A380 test aircraft continue to perform test procedures.

Airbus obtained type certificates for the A380-841 and A380-842 model from the EASA and FAA on 12 December 2006 in a joint ceremony at the company&#x27;s French headquarters, receiving the ICAO code A388. The A380-861 model was added to the type certificate on 14 December 2007.

===Production and delivery delays===
Initial production of the A380 was troubled by delays attributed to the of wiring in each aircraft. Airbus cited as underlying causes the complexity of the cabin wiring (98,000 wires and 40,000 connectors), its concurrent design and production, the high degree of customisation for each airline, and failures of configuration management and change control. The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4, while British and French sites migrated to version 5. This caused overall configuration management problems, at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors necessitated special design rules including non-standard dimensions and bend radii; these were not easily transferred between versions of the software. File conversion tools were initially developed by Airbus to help solve this problem; however, the digital mock-up was still unable to read the full technical design data. Furthermore, organisational culture was also cited as a cause of the production delays. The communication and reporting culture at the time frowned upon delivery of bad news, meaning Airbus was unable to take early actions to mitigate technical and production issues.

Airbus announced the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months. This reduced the total number of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90–100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months. Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70–80 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus&#x27; parent, EADS, and led to the departure of EADS CEO Paul Dupont, Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert, and A380 programme manager Charles Champion. On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 programme, Airbus CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay, pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010. The delay also increased the earnings shortfall projected by Airbus through 2010 to €4.8 billion.

As Airbus prioritised the work on the A380-800 over the A380F, freighter orders were cancelled by FedEx and United Parcel Service, or converted to A380-800 by Emirates and ILFC. Airbus suspended work on the freighter version, but said it remained on offer, albeit without a service entry date. For the passenger version Airbus negotiated a revised delivery schedule and compensation with the 13 customers, all of which retained their orders with some placing subsequent orders, including Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Air France, Qatar Airways, and Korean Air.

Beginning in 2007, the A380 was considered as a potential replacement for the existing Boeing VC-25 serving as Air Force One presidential transport, but in January 2009 EADS declared that they were not going to bid for the contract, as assembling only three planes in the US would not make financial sense.

On 13 May 2008, Airbus announced reduced deliveries for the years 2008 (12) and 2009 (21). After further manufacturing setbacks, Airbus announced its plan to deliver 14 A380s in 2009, down from the previously revised target of 18. A total of 10 A380s were delivered in 2009. In 2010, Airbus delivered 18 of the expected 20 A380s, due to Rolls-Royce engine availability problems. Airbus planned to deliver &quot;between 20 and 25&quot; A380s in 2011 before ramping up to three a month in 2012. In fact, Airbus delivered 26 units, thus outdoing its predicted output for the first time. , production was 3 aircraft per month. Among the production problems are challenging interiors, interiors being installed sequentially rather than concurrently as in smaller planes, and union/government objections to streamlining.

===Entry into service===

Nicknamed &quot;Superjumbo&quot;, the first A380, MSN003, was delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October 2007 with flight number SQ380 between Singapore and Sydney. Passengers bought seats in a charity online auction paying between $560 and $100,380. Two months later, Singapore Airlines CEO Chew Choong Seng stated the A380 was performing better than either the airline or Airbus had anticipated, burning 20% less fuel per seat-mile than the airline&#x27;s 747-400 fleet. Emirates&#x27; Tim Clark claimed that the A380 has better fuel economy at Mach 0.86 than at 0.83, and that its technical dispatch reliability is at 97%, the same as Singapore Airlines. Airbus is committed to reach the industry standard of 98.5%.

Emirates was the second airline to receive the A380 and commenced service between Dubai and New York in August 2008. Qantas followed, with flights between Melbourne and Los Angeles in October 2008. By the end of 2008, 890,000 passengers had flown on 2,200 flights.

In February 2008, the A380 became the first airliner to fly using synthetic liquid fuel. The fuel is processed from gas to liquid form (GTL fuel). The flight was 3 hours long, taking off from Filton, UK, and landing in Toulouse, France, and was a significant step in evaluating the suitability of sustainable aviation fuels.

===Improvements and upgrades===
In 2010, Airbus announced a new A380 build standard, incorporating a strengthened airframe structure and a 1.5° increase in wing twist. Airbus also offered, as an option, an improved maximum take-off weight, thus providing a better payload/range performance. Maximum take-off weight is increased by , to and the range is extended by ; this is achieved by reducing flight loads, partly from optimising the fly-by-wire control laws. British Airways and Emirates were the first two customers to have received this new option in 2013. Emirates asked for an update with new engines for the A380 to be competitive with the Boeing 777X around 2020, and Airbus was studying 11-abreast seating.

In 2012, Airbus announced another increase in the A380&#x27;s maximum take-off weight to , a 6 t increase from the initial A380 variant and 2 t higher than the increased-weight proposal of 2010. This increased the range by some , taking its capability to around at current payloads. The higher-weight version was offered for introduction to service early in 2013.

===Post-delivery problems===
During repairs following the Qantas Flight 32 engine failure incident, cracks were discovered in wing fittings. As a result, the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an Airworthiness Directive in January 2012 which affected 20 A380 aircraft that had accumulated over 1,300 flights. A380s with under 1,800 flight hours were to be inspected within 6 weeks or 84 flights; aircraft with over 1,800 flight hours were to be examined within four days or 14 flights. Fittings found to be cracked were replaced. On 8 February 2012, the checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation. The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations. EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over $130 million, to be borne by Airbus. The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings. Additionally, major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets. Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this problem.

Around 2014, Airbus changed about 10% of all A380 doors, as some leaked during flight. One occurrence resulted in dropped oxygen masks and an emergency landing. The switch was estimated to cost over €100 million. Airbus stated that safety was sufficient, as the air pressure pushed the door into the frame.

===Further continuation of programme===
At the July 2016 Farnborough Airshow, Airbus announced that in a &quot;prudent, proactive step&quot;, starting in 2018, it expected to deliver 12 A380 aircraft per year, down from 27 deliveries in 2015. The firm also warned production might slip back into red ink (be unprofitable) on each aircraft produced at that time, though it anticipated production would remain in the black (profitable) for 2016 and 2017. &quot;The company will continue to improve the efficiency of its industrial system to achieve breakeven at 20 aircraft in 2017 and targets additional cost reduction initiatives to lower breakeven further.&quot; Airbus expected that healthy demand for its other aircraft would allow it to avoid job losses from the cuts.
As Airbus expected to build 15 airliners in 2017 and 12 in 2018, Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Brégier said that, without orders in 2017, production would be reduced to below one per month while remaining profitable per unit and allowing the programme to continue for 20 to 30 years. In its 2017 half-year report, Airbus adjusted 2019 deliveries to eight aircraft. In November 2017, its chief executive Tom Enders was confident Airbus would still produce A380s in 2027 with more sales to come, and further develop it to keep it competitive beyond 2030. Airbus was profitable at a rate of 15 per year and is trying to drive breakeven down further but will take losses at eight per year.

An order from Emirates for 36 A380s would have ensured production beyond 2020, but the airline wanted guarantees that production would be maintained for 10 years, until 2028: reducing output to six a year would help to bridge that period and would support second-hand values while other buyers are approached, but the programme would still be unprofitable. If it had failed to win the Emirates order, Airbus claimed that it was ready to phase out its production gradually as it fulfilled remaining orders until the early 2020s. In January 2018, Emirates confirmed the order for 36 A380s, but the deal was thrown back into question in October 2018 over a disagreement regarding engine fuel burn.

To extend the programme, Airbus offered China a production role in early 2018. While state-owned Chinese airlines could order A380s, it would not help their low yield, as it lowers frequency; they do not need more volume as widebody aircraft are already used on domestic routes and using the A380 on its intended long-haul missions would free only a few airport slots.

After achieving efficiencies to sustain production at a lower level, in 2017, Airbus delivered 15 A380s and was &quot;very close&quot; to production breakeven, expecting to make additional savings as production was being further reduced: it planned to deliver 12 in 2018, eight in 2019 and six per year from 2020 with &quot;digestible&quot; losses. , Enders was confident the A380 would gain additional orders from existing or new operators, and saw opportunities in Asia and particularly in China where it is &quot;under-represented&quot;.

In 2019, Lufthansa had retired 6 of its 14 A380s due to their unprofitability. Later that year, Qatar Airways announced a switch from the A380 to the Boeing 777X starting from 2024.

===End of production===

In February 2019, Airbus announced it would end A380 production by 2021, after its main customer, Emirates, agreed to drop an order for 39 of the aircraft, replacing it with 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s. At the time of the announcement, Airbus had 17 more A380s on its order book to complete before closing the production line14 for Emirates and three for All Nippon Airwaystaking the total number of expected deliveries of the aircraft type to 251. Airbus would have needed more than $90 million profit from the sale of each aircraft to cover the estimated $25 billion development cost of the programme. However, the $445 million price tag of each aircraft was not sufficient to even cover the production cost. With orders decreasing, the decision was made to cease production. Enders stated on 14 February 2019, &quot;If you have a product that nobody wants anymore, or you can sell only below production cost, you have to stop it.&quot;

One reason that the A380 did not achieve commercial viability for Airbus has been attributed to its extremely large capacity being optimised for a hub-and-spoke system, which was projected by Airbus to be thriving when the programme was conceived. However, airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a point-to-point system, which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three. The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat-distance, but efficiency within the hub-and-spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point-to-point system. Specifically, US based carriers had been using a multihub strategy, which justified the need for only a handful of VLAs (&quot;very large aircraft&quot; with more than 400 seats) such as the A380, and having too few VLAs meant that they could not achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure. Consequently, orders for VLAs slowed in the mid 2010s, as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency, giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost.

On 25 September 2020, Airbus completed assembly of the final A380 fuselage. Nine aircraft remained to be delivered (eight for Emirates, one for All Nippon Airways) and production operations continued to finish those aircraft. On 17 March 2021, the final Airbus A380 (manufacturing serial number 272) made its maiden flight from Toulouse to Hamburg for cabin outfitting, before being delivered to Emirates on 16 December 2021.

==Design==
===Overview===
The A380 was initially offered in two models: the &quot;A380-800&quot; and the &quot;A380F&quot;.

The A380-800&#x27;s original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration. Then in May 2007, Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers (525 total in three classes)—traded for more range—to better reflect trends in premium-class accommodation. The design range for the A380−800 model is ; capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non-stop. The A380 is designed for 19,000 cycles.

The second model, the &quot;A380F&quot; freighter, would have carried of cargo over a range of . Freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version, and all orders for freighters were cancelled.

Other proposed variants included an &quot;A380-900&quot; stretchseating about 656 passengers (or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration)and an extended-range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380-800.

===Engines===

The A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines.
The Trent 900 is a combination of the fan and scaled compressor of the 777-200X/300X Trent 8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777&#x27;s Trent 800, and the Airbus A340-500/600&#x27;s Trent 500 core.
The GP7200 core technology is derived from GE&#x27;s GE90 and its sections are based on the PW4000 expertise.
At its launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level of technology and they would be state-of-the-art for the next decade, but three years later Boeing launched the 787 Dreamliner with game-changing technology and 10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy.
Due to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa&#x27;s A380s produce half the noise of the Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers. In 2012, the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society.
London Heathrow is a key destination for the A380.
The aircraft is below the QC/2 departure and QC/0.5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by the airport. Field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the A380 may be excessively generous compared to the older Boeing 747, but still quieter. Rolls-Royce is supporting the CAA in understanding the relatively high A380/Trent 900 monitored noise levels. Heathrow&#x27;s landing charges having a noise component, the A380 is cheaper to land there than a Boeing 777-200 and -300 and it saves $4,300 to $5,200 per landing, or $15.3M to $18.8M of present value over 15 years. Tokyo Narita has a similar noise charge.
The A380 has thrust reversers on the inboard engines only. The outboard engines lack them, reducing the amount of debris stirred up during landing. The combination of wheel braking and large spoilers and flaps reduces the aircraft&#x27;s reliance on thrust reversal. The reversers are electrically actuated to save weight, and for greater reliability than pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents. Having reversers on only two engines also saves a great deal of maintenance expense for operators as well as avoiding unnecessary weight to the outboard engines.

===Wings===

The A380&#x27;s wings are built for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over 600 tonnes to accommodate larger variants—the A380F freighter would require added internal strengthening. The optimal wingspan for such an MTOW is about but airport restrictions of force the A380 to compensate with a longer chord for an aspect ratio of 7.8. This suboptimal aspect ratio reduces fuel efficiency by about 10% and increases operating costs several percent, considering fuel costs constitute about 50% of the cost of long-haul aeroplane operation. The common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency on the A380-800 passenger model in particular because its lower MTOW allows for a higher aspect ratio with a shorter chord or thinner wing.

Still, Airbus estimated that the A380&#x27;s size and advanced technology would provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747-400. The wings incorporate wingtip fences that extend above and below the wing surface, similar to those on the A310 and A320. These increase fuel efficiency and range by reducing induced drag. The wingtip fences also reduce wake turbulence, which endangers following aircraft. The wings of the A380 were designed in Filton and manufactured in Broughton in the United Kingdom. The wings were then transported to the harbour of Mostyn, where they were transported by barge to Toulouse, France, for integration and final assembly with the rest of the aircraft and its components.

Singapore Airlines describe the A380&#x27;s landing speed of as &quot;impressively slow&quot;.

===Materials===
While most of the fuselage is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380&#x27;s airframe. Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, glass-fibre reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage), tail surfaces, and doors. The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon–fibre reinforced plastic. It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross–section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics are used in the leading edges of the slats.

The hybrid fibre metal laminate material GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers&#x27; leading edges. This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation. Unlike earlier composite materials, GLARE can be repaired using conventional aluminium repair techniques.

Newer weldable aluminium alloys are used in the A380&#x27;s airframe. This enabled the widespread use of laser beam welding manufacturing techniques, eliminating rows of rivets and resulting in a lighter, stronger structure. High-strength aluminium (type 7449) reinforced with carbon fibre was used in the wing brackets of the first 120 A380s to reduce weight, but cracks were discovered and newer sets of the more critical brackets are made of standard aluminium 7010, increasing weight by 90 kg (198 lb). Repair costs for earlier aircraft were expected to be around €500 million (US$629 million).

It takes of paint to cover the exterior of an A380. The paint is five layers thick and weighs about 650 kg (1,433 lb) when dry.

===Avionics===
The A380 employs an integrated modular avionics (IMA) architecture, first used in advanced military aircraft, such as the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, and Dassault Rafale. The main IMA systems on the A380 were developed by the Thales Group. Designed and developed by Airbus, Thales and Diehl Aerospace, the IMA suite was first used on the A380. The suite is a technological innovation, with networked computing modules to support different applications. The data networks use Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet, an implementation of ARINC 664. These are switched, full-duplex, star-topology and based on 100baseTX fast-Ethernet. This reduces the amount of wiring required and minimises latency.
Airbus used similar cockpit layout, procedures and handling characteristics to other Airbus aircraft, reducing crew training costs. The A380 has an improved glass cockpit, using fly-by-wire flight controls linked to side-sticks. The cockpit has eight liquid crystal displays, all physically identical and interchangeable; comprising two primary flight displays, two navigation displays, one engine parameter display, one system display and two multi-function displays. The MFDs were introduced on the A380 to provide an easy-to-use interface to the flight management system—replacing three multifunction control and display units. They include QWERTY keyboards and trackballs, interfacing with a graphical &quot;point-and-click&quot; display system.

The Network Systems Server (NSS) is the heart of A380s paperless cockpit; it eliminates bulky manuals and traditional charts. The NSS has enough inbuilt robustness to eliminate onboard backup paper documents. The A380s network and server system stores data and offers electronic documentation, providing a required equipment list, navigation charts, performance calculations, and an aircraft logbook. This is accessed through the MFDs and controlled via the keyboard interface.

===Systems===
Power-by-wire flight control actuators have been used for the first time in civil aviation to back up primary hydraulic actuators. Also, during certain manoeuvres they augment the primary actuators. They have self-contained hydraulic and electrical power supplies. Electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) are used in the aileron and elevator, electric and hydraulic motors to drive the slats as well as electrical backup hydrostatic actuators (EBHA) for the rudder and some spoilers.

The A380&#x27;s 350 bar (35 MPa or 5,000 psi) hydraulic system is a significant difference from the typical 210 bar (21 MPa or 3,000 psi) hydraulics used on most commercial aircraft since the 1940s. First used in military aircraft, high-pressure hydraulics reduce the weight and size of pipelines, actuators and related components. The 350 bar pressure is generated by eight de-clutchable hydraulic pumps. The hydraulic lines are typically made from titanium; the system features both fuel- and air-cooled heat exchangers. Self-contained electrically powered hydraulic power packs serve as backups for the primary systems, instead of a secondary hydraulic system, saving weight and reducing maintenance.

The A380 uses four 150 kVA variable-frequency electrical generators, eliminating constant-speed drives and improving reliability. The A380 uses aluminium power cables instead of copper for weight reduction. The electrical power system is fully computerised and many contactors and breakers have been replaced by solid-state devices for better performance and increased reliability.
The auxiliary power comprises the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), the electronic control box (ECB), and mounting hardware. The APU in use on the A380 is the PW 980A APU. The APU primarily provides air to power the Analysis Ground Station (AGS) on the ground and to start the engines. The AGS is a semi-automatic analysis system of flight data that helps to optimise management of maintenance and reduce costs. The APU also powers two 120 kVA electric generators that provide auxiliary electric power to the aircraft. There is also a ram air turbine (RAT) with a 70 kVA generator.

===Passenger provisions===

The A380-800&#x27;s cabin has of usable floor space, 40% more than the next largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8.

The cabin has features to reduce traveller fatigue such as a quieter interior and higher pressurisation than previous generations of aircraft; the A380 is pressurised to the equivalent altitude of up to . It has 50% less cabin noise, 50% more cabin area and volume, larger windows, bigger overhead bins, and more headroom than the 747-400. Seating options range from 3-room &quot;residence&quot; in first class to 11-across in economy. A380 economy seats are up to wide in a 10-abreast configuration, compared with the 10-abreast configuration on the 747-400 that typically has seats wide. On other aircraft, economy seats range from in width.

The A380&#x27;s upper and lower decks are connected by two stairways, one fore and one aft, both wide enough to accommodate two passengers side by side; this cabin arrangement allows multiple seat configurations. The maximum certified carrying capacity is 853 passengers in an all-economy-class layout, Airbus lists the &quot;typical&quot; three-class layout as accommodating 525 passengers, with 10 first, 76 business, and 439 economy class seats. Airline configurations range from Korean Air&#x27;s 407 passengers to Emirates&#x27; two-class 615 seats and average around 480–490 seats. Air Austral&#x27;s proposed 840 passenger layout has not come to fruition. The A380&#x27;s interior illumination system uses bulbless LEDs in the cabin, cockpit, and cargo decks. The LEDs in the cabin can be altered to create an ambience simulating daylight, night, or intermediate levels. On the outside of the aircraft, HID lighting is used for brighter illumination.

Airbus&#x27;s publicity has stressed the comfort and space of the A380 cabin, and advertised onboard relaxation areas such as bars, beauty salons, duty-free shops, and restaurants. Proposed amenities resembled those installed on earlier airliners, particularly 1970s wide-body jets, which largely gave way to regular seats for greater passenger capacity. Airbus has acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed, and that it was ultimately the airlines&#x27; decision how to configure the interior. Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds, and raised costs. Due to delivery delays, Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380.

Initial operators typically configured their A380s for three-class service, while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins. Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed first-class suites on its A380s in 2007, each featuring a leather seat with a separate bed; center suites could be joined to create a double bed. A year later, Qantas debuted a new first-class seat-bed and a sofa lounge at the front of the upper deck on its A380s, and in 2009, Air France unveiled an upper deck electronic art gallery. In late 2008, Emirates introduced &quot;shower spas&quot; in first class on its A380s allowing each first class passenger five minutes of hot water, drawing on 2.5 tonnes of water, although only 60% of it was used.

Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways also have a bar lounge and seating area on the upper deck, while Etihad has enclosed areas for two people each. In addition to lounge areas, some A380 operators have installed amenities consistent with other aircraft in their respective fleets, including self-serve snack bars, premium economy sections, and redesigned business-class seating.

The Hamburg Aircraft Interiors Expo in April 2015 saw the presentation of an 11-seat row economy cabin for the A380. Airbus is reacting to a changing economy; the recession which began in 2008 saw a drop in market percentage of first class and business seats to six percent and an increase in budget economy travellers. Among other causes is the reluctance of employers to pay for executives to travel in First or Business Class. Airbus&#x27; chief of cabin marketing, Ingo Wuggestzer, told &quot;Aviation Week and Space Technology&quot; that the standard three-class cabin no longer reflected market conditions. The 11-seat row on the A380 is accompanied by similar options on other widebodies: nine across on the Airbus A330 and ten across on the A350.

===Integration with infrastructure and regulations===

====Ground operations====

In the 1990s, aircraft manufacturers were planning to introduce larger planes than the Boeing 747. In a common effort of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with manufacturers, airports and its member agencies, the &quot;80-metre box&quot; was created, the airport gates allowing planes up to wingspan and length to be accommodated. Airbus designed the A380 according to these guidelines, and to operate safely on Group V runways and taxiways with a loadbearing width. The US FAA initially opposed this, then in July 2007, the FAA and EASA agreed to let the A380 operate on runways without restrictions. The A380-800 is approximately 30% larger in overall size than the 747-400. Runway lighting and signage may need changes to provide clearance to the wings and avoid blast damage from the engines. Runways, runway shoulders and taxiway shoulders may be required to be stabilised to reduce the likelihood of foreign object damage caused to (or by) the outboard engines, which are more than from the centre line of the aircraft, compared to for the 747-400, and 747-8.

Airbus measured pavement loads using a 540-tonne (595 short tons) ballasted test rig, designed to replicate the landing gear of the A380. The rig was towed over a section of pavement at Airbus&#x27;s facilities that had been instrumented with embedded load sensors. It was determined that the pavement of most runways will not need to be reinforced despite the higher weight, as it is distributed on more wheels than in other passenger aircraft with a total of 22 wheels (that is, its ground pressure is lower). The A380 undercarriage consists of four main landing gear legs and one noseleg (a layout similar to that of the 747), with the two inboard landing gear legs each supporting six wheels.

The A380 requires service vehicles with lifts capable of reaching the upper deck, as well as tractors capable of handling the A380&#x27;s maximum ramp weight. When using two jetway bridges the boarding time is 45 min, and when using an extra jetway to the upper deck it is reduced to 34 min. The A380 has an airport turnaround time of 90–110 minutes. In 2008, the A380 test aircraft were used to trial the modifications made to several airports to accommodate the type.

====Takeoff and landing separation====


As of 2023, the A380 is the only aircraft in wake turbulence category Super (J).

In 2005, the ICAO recommended that provisional separation criteria for the A380 on takeoff and landing be substantially greater than for the 747 because preliminary flight test data suggested a stronger wake turbulence. These criteria were in effect while the ICAO&#x27;s wake vortex steering group, with representatives from the JAA, Eurocontrol, the FAA, and Airbus, refined its 3-year study of the issue with additional flight testing. In September 2006, the working group presented its first conclusions to the ICAO.

In November 2006, the ICAO issued new interim recommendations. Replacing a blanket separation for aircraft trailing an A380 during approach, the new distances were , and respectively for non-A380 &quot;Heavy&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;Light&quot; ICAO aircraft categories. These compared with the , and spacing applicable to other &quot;Heavy&quot; aircraft. Another A380 following an A380 should maintain a separation of . On departure behind an A380, non-A380 &quot;Heavy&quot; aircraft are required to wait two minutes, and &quot;Medium&quot;/&quot;Light&quot; aircraft three minutes for time based operations. The ICAO also recommends that pilots append the term &quot;Super&quot; to the aircraft&#x27;s callsign when initiating communication with air traffic control, to distinguish the A380 from &quot;Heavy&quot; aircraft.

In August 2008, the ICAO issued revised approach separations of for Super (another A380), for Heavy, for medium/small, and for light. In November 2008, an incident on a parallel runway during crosswinds made the Australian authorities change procedures for those conditions.

====Maintenance====
As the A380 fleet grows older, airworthiness authority rules require certain scheduled inspections from approved aircraft tool shops. The increasing fleet size (at the time projected to reach 286 aircraft in 2020) cause expected maintenance and modification to cost $6.8 billion for 2015–2020, of which $2.1 billion are for engines. Emirates performed its first 3C-check for 55 days in 2014. During lengthy shop stays, some airlines will use the opportunity to install new interiors.
==Operational history==
In February 2009, the one millionth passenger was flown with Singapore Airlines and by May of that year 1,500,000 passengers had flown on 4,200 flights. Air France received its first A380 in October 2009. Lufthansa received its first A380 in May 2010. By July 2010, the 31 A380s then in service had transported 6 million passengers on 17,000 flights between 20 international destinations.

Airbus delivered the 100th A380 on 14 March 2013 to Malaysia Airlines. In June 2014, over 65 million passengers had flown the A380, and more than 100 million passengers (averaging 375 per flight) by September 2015, with an availability of 98.5%. In 2014, Emirates stated that its A380 fleet had load factors of 90–100%, and that the popularity of the aircraft with its passengers had not decreased in the past year.

On 16 December 2021, their largest customer, Emirates, received its 123rd A380 in Hamburg, which was the 251st and the last Superjumbo delivered by Airbus. The airline&#x27;s strategy has enabled A380 teams to develop new innovations on an ongoing basis and improve the aircraft&#x27;s operational performance by up to 99.3%, a level never seen before on a quadjet airliner. Many of the innovations developed on the Emirates A380 cabin were a first for Airbus, such as the first class showers, lighting scenarios, and the recent premium economy cabin. The close collaboration has shaped the identity of the A380 over the years and continues to transform the passenger experience today.

, the global A380 fleet had carried over 300 million passengers to more than 70 destinations and completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with 99 percent operational reliability and no hull-loss accidents. Over 50% of A380 capacity is from/to/within the Asia-Pacific region, of which around 15% is on regional flights within Asia (OAG 2017).
==Proposed variants==
While the A380-800 was the only model put into production, other variants were proposed that might have made the design more appealing in shifting market conditions.

===A380F===
Airbus offered a cargo aircraft variant, called the &quot;A380F&quot;, since at least June 2005, capable of transporting a maximum payload over a range. It would have had 7% better payload and better range than the Boeing 747-8F, but also higher trip costs. It would have the largest payload capacity of any freighter aircraft except the Antonov An-225 Mriya.

Production was suspended until the A380 production lines had settled, with no firm availability date. The A380F was displayed on the Airbus website until at least January 2013, but was not anymore in April. A patent for a &quot;combi&quot; version was applied for. This version would offer the flexibility of carrying both passengers and cargo, along with being rapidly reconfigurable to expand or contract the cargo area and passenger area as needed for a given flight.

===A380 Stretch, A380-900===
At launch in December 2000, a 656-seat A380-200 was proposed as a derivative of the 555-seat baseline, called the &quot;A380 Stretch&quot;.

In November 2007, Airbus top sales executive and chief operating officer John Leahy confirmed plans for another enlarged variant—the A380-900—with more seating space than the A380-800. The A380-900 would have had a seating capacity for 650 passengers in standard configuration and for approximately 900 passengers in an economy-only configuration. Airlines that expressed an interest in the A380-900 included Emirates, Virgin Atlantic, Cathay Pacific, Air France, KLM, Lufthansa, Kingfisher Airlines, and leasing company ILFC. In May 2010, Airbus announced that A380-900 development would be postponed until production of the A380-800 stabilised.

On 11 December 2014, at the annual Airbus Investor Day forum, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier controversially announced, &quot;We will one day launch an A380neo and one day launch a stretched A380&quot;. This statement followed speculation sparked by Airbus CFO Harald Wilhelm that Airbus could possibly axe the A380 ahead of its time due to softening demand.

On 15 June 2015, John Leahy, Airbus&#x27;s chief operating officer for customers, stated that Airbus was again looking at the A380-900 programme. Airbus&#x27;s newest concept would be a stretch of the A380-800 offering 50 seats more—not 100 seats as originally envisaged. This stretch would be tied to a potential re-engining of the A380-800. According to Flight Global, an A380-900 would make better use of the A380&#x27;s existing wing.

===A380neo===
On 15 June 2015, Reuters reported that Airbus was discussing an improved and stretched version of the A380 with at least six customers. The aircraft, called the &quot;A380neo&quot;, featured new engines and would accommodate an additional fifty passengers. Deliveries to customers were planned for sometime in 2020 or 2021. On 19 July 2015, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier stated that the company will build a new version of the A380 featuring new improved wings and new engines. Speculation about the development of a so-called A380neo (&quot;neo&quot; for &quot;new engine option&quot;) had been going on for a few months after earlier press releases in 2014, and in 2015, the company was considering whether to end production of the type prior to 2018 or develop a new A380 variant. Later it was revealed that Airbus was looking at both the possibility of a longer A380 in line of the previously planned A380-900 and a new engine version, i.e. A380neo. Brégier also revealed that the new variant would be ready to enter service by 2020. The engine would most likely be one of a variety of all-new options from Rolls-Royce, ranging from derivatives of the A350&#x27;s XWB-84/97 to the future Advance project due at around 2020.

On 3 June 2016, Emirates President Tim Clark stated that talks between Emirates and Airbus on the A380neo have &quot;lapsed&quot;. On 12 June 2017, Fabrice Brégier confirmed that Airbus would not launch an A380neo, stating &quot;...there is no business case to do that, this is absolutely clear.&quot; However, Brégier stated it would not stop Airbus from looking at what could be done to improve the performance of the aircraft. One such proposal is a wingspan extension to reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency by 4%, though further increase is likely to be seen on the aircraft with new Sharklets like on the A380plus.
Tim Clark stated the proposed re-engining would have offered a 12–14% fuel-burn reduction with an enhanced Trent XWB.

In June 2023, despite A380 production having ceased, Clark renewed his plea for a re-engined A380neo, suggesting that a next-generation Rolls-Royce UltraFan could give a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions.

=== A380plus ===
At the June 2017 Paris Air Show, Airbus proposed an enhanced variant, called the &quot;A380plus&quot;, with 13% lower costs per seat, featuring up to 80 more seats through better use of cabin space, split scimitar winglets and wing refinements allowing a 4% fuel economy improvement, and longer aircraft maintenance intervals with less downtime. The A380plus&#x27; maximum takeoff weight would have been increased by to , allowing it to carry more passengers over the same range or increase the range by .

Winglet mockups, high, were displayed on the MSN04 test aircraft at Le Bourget. Wing twist would have been modified and camber changed by increasing its height by between Rib 10 and Rib 30, along with upper-belly fairing improvements. The in-flight entertainment, the flight management system and the fuel pumps would be from the A350 to reduce weight and improve reliability and fuel economy. Light checks for the A380plus would be required after 1,000 h instead of 750 h and heavy check downtime would be reduced to keep the aircraft flying for six days more per year.

==Market==
===Size===
In its 2000 Global Market Forecast, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,235 passenger Very Large Aircraft (VLA) with more than 400 seats: 360 up to 2009 and 875 by 2019.
In late 2003, Boeing forecast 320 &quot;Boeing 747 and larger&quot; passenger aircraft over 20 years, close to the 298 orders actually placed for the A380 and 747-8 passenger airliners as of March 2020.

In 2007, Airbus estimated a demand for 1,283 VLAs in the following 20 years if airport congestion remains constant, up to 1,771 VLAs if congestion increases, with most deliveries (56%) in Asia-Pacific, and 415 very large, 120-tonne plus freighters. For the same period, Boeing was estimating the demand for 590 large (747 or A380) passenger airliners and 630 freighters.
Estimates for the total over a twenty-year period have varied from 400 to over 1,700.

===Frequency and capacity===
In 2013, Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines needed to balance frequency and capacity. China Southern struggled for two years to use its A380s from Beijing, and finally received Boeing 787s in its base in Guangzhou, but where it cannot command a premium, unlike Beijing or Shanghai. In 2013, Air France withdrew A380 services to Singapore and Montreal and switched to smaller aircraft.

In 2014, British Airways replaced three 777 flights between London and Los Angeles with two A380 per day. Emirates&#x27; Tim Clark saw a large potential for East Asian A380-users, and criticised Airbus&#x27; marketing efforts. As many business travellers prefer more choices offered by greater flight frequency achieved by flying any given route multiple times on smaller aircraft, rather than fewer flights on larger planes, United Airlines observed the A380 &quot;just doesn&#x27;t really work for us&quot; with a much higher trip cost than the Boeing 787.

At the A380 launch, most Europe-Asia and transpacific routes used Boeing 747-400s at fairly low frequencies but, since then, routes proliferated with open skies, and most airlines downsized, offering higher frequencies and more routes.
The huge capacity offered by each flight eroded the yield: North America was viewed as 17% of the market but the A380 never materialised as a 747 replacement, with only 15 747s remaining in passenger service in November 2017 for transpacific routes, where time zones restrict potential frequency. Consolidation changed the networks, and US majors constrained capacity and emphasised daily frequencies for business traffic with midsize widebodies like the 787, to extract higher yields; the focus being on profits, with market share ceded to Asian carriers.

The 747 was largely replaced on transatlantic flights by the 767, and on the transpacific flights by the 777; newer, smaller aircraft with similar seat-mile costs have lower trip costs and allow more direct routes.
Cabin &#x27;densification&#x27;, to lower unit costs, could aggravate this overcapacity.

===Production===
In 2005, 270 sales were necessary to attain break-even and with 751 expected deliveries its internal rate of return outlook was at 19%, but due to disruptions in the ramp-up leading to overcosts and delayed deliveries, it increased to 420 in 2006. In 2010, EADS CFO Hans Peter Ring said that break-even could be achieved by 2015 when 200 deliveries were projected. In 2012, Airbus clarified that the aircraft production costs would be less than its sales price.

On 11 December 2014, Airbus chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm hinted the possibility of ending the programme in 2018, disappointing Emirates president Tim Clark. Airbus shares fell down consequently. Airbus responded to the protests by playing down the possibility the A380 would be abandoned, instead emphasising that enhancing the aeroplane was a likelier scenario. On 22 December 2014, as the jet was about to break even, Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier ruled out cancelling it.

Ten years after its first flight, Brégier said it was &quot;almost certainly introduced ten years too early&quot;. While no longer losing money on each plane sold, Airbus admits that the company will never recoup the $25 billion investment it made in the project.

Airbus consistently forecast 1,400 VLA demand over 20-year, still in 2017, and aimed to secure a 50% share, up to 700 units, but delivered 215 aircraft in 10 years, achieving three produced per month but not the four per month target after the ramp-up to achieve more than 350 and is now declining to 0.5 a month.
As Boeing see the VLA market as too small to retain in its 2017 forecast, its VP marketing Randy Tinseth does not believe Airbus will deliver the rest of the backlog.

Richard Aboulafia predicted a 2020 final delivery, with unpleasant losses due to &quot;hubris, shoddy market analysis, nationalism and simple wishful thinking&quot;.
In 2017, the A380 fleet exceeded the number of remaining passenger B747s, which had declined from 740 aircraft when the A380 was launched in 2000 to 550 units when the A380 was introduced in 2007, and around 200 ten years later. However, the market-share battle has shifted to large single-aisles and 300-seat twin-aisles.

===Cost===
, the list price of an A380 was US$432.6 million. Negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower, and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself. The first aircraft was sold and leased back by Singapore Airlines in 2007 to Dr. Peters for $197 million. In 2016, IAG&#x27;s Willie Walsh said he could add a few, but also that he found the price of new aircraft &quot;outrageous&quot; and would source them from the second-hand market.

AirInsight estimates its hourly cost at $26,000, or around $50 per seat hour (when configured for only seats), which compares to $44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777-300ER, and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 . The A380 was designed with large wing and tail surfaces to accommodate a planned stretch; this resulted in a high empty weight per seat. The stretch never occurred to take advantage of this, and the A380&#x27;s cost-per-seat is expected to be matched by the A350-1000 and 777-9.

===Economic aspects===
With a theoretical maximum seating capacity of 853 seats, which is not used by any airline, the Airbus A380 consumes 2.4 liters of kerosene per 100 passenger kilometers. This increases with a reduced seating capacity from 555 to 3.5 l/100 pkm and is 5.2 liters of kerosene per 100 passenger kilometers in the smallest possible variant with only 362 seats.

===Secondary===
As of 2015, several airlines expressed their interest in selling their aircraft, partially coinciding with expiring lease contracts for the aircraft. Several in-service A380s were offered for lease to other airlines. The suggestion prompted concerns on the potential for new sales for Airbus, although these were dismissed by Airbus COO John Leahy who stated that &quot;Used A380s do not compete with new A380s&quot;, noting that the second-hand market is more interesting for parties otherwise looking to buy smaller aircraft such as the Boeing 777.

After Malaysia Airlines was unable to sell or lease its six A380s, it decided to refurbish the aircraft with seating for 700 and transfer them to a subsidiary carrier for religious pilgrimage flights. As it started receiving its six A350s to replace its A380s in December 2017, the new subsidiary will serve the Hajj and Umrah market with them, starting in the third quarter of 2018 and could be expanded above six beyond 2020 to 2022. The cabin will have 36 business seats and 600 economy seats, with a 712-seat reconfiguration possible within five days. The fleet could be chartered half the year for the tourism industry like cruise shipping and will be able to operate for the next 40 years if oil prices stay low.
As they should be parked by June 2018 before reconfiguration, MAS confirmed the plans and will also use them for peak periods to high traffic markets like London.

In August 2017, it was announced that Hi Fly would lease two used aircraft. The Portuguese ACMI/charter airline will use the aircraft for markets where high capacity is needed and airports where slots are scarce. The first aircraft was scheduled to begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2018 Hi Fly was to receive its A380s from mid 2018 in a 471-seat configuration: 399 on the main deck, 60 business-class and 12 first-class seats on the upper deck, the Singapore Airlines layout. Hi Fly first used one of their A380s on 1 August 2018 for a one-off flight to enable Thomas Cook Airlines to repatriate passengers from Rhodes to Copenhagen following IT problems in the Greek airport. The same aircraft was then wet-leased to Norwegian to operate its evening London-New York service for several weeks in August 2018, to alleviate availability issues on its Boeing 787s affected by Trent 1000 engine problems; Air Austral also signed a deal to wet-lease an A380 from Hi Fly while one of its 787s is grounded for three months of Trent 1000 inspections.
As of December 2019, Hi Fly has leased one used A380.

Amedeo, mainly an A380 lessor and the largest with 22, mostly leased to Emirates, wants to find a use for them after their lease expires from 2022, and study if there is a demand to wet lease them.
Swiss aircraft broker Sparfell &amp; Partners plans to convert for head-of-state or VVIP transport some of Dr. Peters&#x27; four ex-SIA A380s for under $300 million apiece, less than a new Boeing 777 or Airbus A330.
As of November 2018, Air France was planning to return five of its A380s to lessors by the end of 2019 and refurbish its other five with new interiors by 2020 for $51 million per aircraft. By July 2019, Air France revised this plan and intended to phase out all ten of its A380s by 2022 as part of an &quot;accelerated&quot; retirement plan, replacing them with no more than nine twin-engined wide-body aircraft. The A330-900, A350-900 and 787-9 were being evaluated as potential replacements.

Following the cancellation of the programme in February 2019, the residual value of existing aircraft is in doubt. While Amedeo argued that cancellation should benefit the value, this will depend on whether any new airlines are prepared to adopt second-hand A380s, and how many existing users continue to operate the aircraft. Even the teardown value is questionable, in that the engines, usually the most valuable part of a scrap aircraft, are not used by any other models.

===Teardown and second-hand market===
With four A380s leased to Singapore Airlines having been returned between October 2017 and March 2018, Dr. Peters feared a weak aftermarket and is considering scrapping them, although they are on sale for a business jet conversion, but on the other hand Airbus sees a potential for African airlines and Chinese airlines, Hajj charters and its large Gulf operators. An A380 parted out may be worth $30 million to $50 million if it is at half-life. Teardown specialists have declined offers for several aircraft at part-out prices due to high risk as a secondary market is uncertain with $30 to $40 million for the refurbishment, but should be between $20 and $30 million to be viable.

When the aircraft were proposed to British Airways, Hi Fly and Iran Air, BA did not want to replace its Boeing 747s until 2021, while Iran Air faced political uncertainty and Hi Fly did not have a convincing business case. Consequently, Dr. Peters recommended to its investors on 28 June 2018 to sell the aircraft parts with VAS Aero Services within two years for US$45 million, quickly for components like the landing gear or the APU.
Rolls-Royce Trent 900 leasing beyond March 2019 should generate US$480,000 monthly for each aircraft before selling the turbofans by 2020. With a total revenue of US$80 million per aircraft, the overall return expected is 145–155% while 72% and 81% of their debt had already been repaid.

The fifth plane coming back from SIA, owned by Doric, has been leased by Hi Fly Malta with a lease period of &quot;nearly 6 years&quot;. Hi Fly Malta became the first operator of second-hand A380 (MSN006). Norwegian Long Haul briefly leased Hi Fly Malta A380 in August 2018, which operated the aircraft following engine problems with their Dreamliner fleet. Norwegian leased the A380 again in late 2018 to help deal with the passenger backlog as a result of the Gatwick Airport drone incident.

Two others returned from Singapore Airlines in the coming weeks (June 2018) but they could stay with an existing Asian A380 flag carrier.

The teardown value includes $32–$33 million from the engines in 2020 and $4 million from leasing them until then, while the value of a 2008 A380 would be $78.4 million in 2020 and its monthly lease in 2018 would be $929,000.
The two aircraft have returned 3.8–4.2% per year since 2008 but the 145–155% return is lower than the 220% originally forecast.
Of the nearly 500 made, 50 747-400s were sold in the secondary market, including only 25 to new customers.
These are among the first A380s delivered, lacking the improvements and weight savings of later ones.

The first two A380s delivered to Singapore Airlines (MSN003 and MSN005) flew to Tarbes, France, to be scrapped. Their engines and some components had been dismantled and removed while the livery was painted over in white.

As of September 2019, Emirates initiated its A380 retirement planwhich will see the type remain in service until at least 2035by retiring two aircraft that were due for a major overhaul, and using them as parts donors for the rest of the fleet. Emirates does not see any demand in the second-hand market, but is indifferent in that the retired aircraft have already been fully written down and thus have no residual value. As further aircraft are retired, Emirates-owned airframes will continue to be used for parts, while leased airframes will be returned to the lessors. One such return to lessor Doric was purchased by Emirates for £25.3 million in late 2022, as spare parts.

==Orders and deliveries==

Fourteen customers have ordered and taken delivery of the A380 as of April 2019. Total orders for the A380 stand at 251 . The biggest customer is Emirates, which has committed to order a total of 123 A380s as of 14 February 2019. One VIP order was made in 2007 but later cancelled by Airbus. The A380F version attracted 27 orders, before they were either cancelled (20) or converted to A380-800 (7) following the production delay and the subsequent suspension of the freighter programme.

Delivery takes place in Hamburg for customers from Europe and the Middle East and in Toulouse for customers from the rest of the world. EADS explained that deliveries in 2013 were to be slowed temporarily to accommodate replacement of the wing rib brackets where cracks were detected earlier in the existing fleet.

In 2013, in expectation of raising the number of orders placed, Airbus announced &quot;attractable discounts&quot; to airlines who placed large orders for the A380. Soon after, at the November 2013 Dubai Air Show, Emirates ordered 150 777X and Etihad Airways ordered 50 aircraft, totalling $20 billion.

In late July 2014, Airbus announced that it had terminated five A380 firm orders from the Japanese low-cost carrier, Skymark Airlines, citing concerns over the airline&#x27;s financial performance. In 2016, the largest Japanese carrier, All Nippon Airways (ANA), took over three of the orders and the remaining two that were already produced and put into long-term storage were taken up later by the main customer, Emirates. Qantas planned to order eight more aircraft but froze its order while the airline restructured its operations. Qantas eventually cancelled its order in February 2019 amid doubts over the A380&#x27;s future.

Amedeo, an aircraft lessor that ordered 20 A380s, had not found a client for the airliner and eventually cancelled their order in 2019.
Virgin Atlantic ordered six A380s in 2001 but never took delivery and later cancelled them in 2018.

In June 2017, Emirates had 48 orders outstanding, but due to lack of space in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and would not take any in 2019–20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021. There were open production slots in 2019, and Airbus reduced its production rate in 2017–2018 at 12 per year. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them any more and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.

At its 100th delivery ceremony, Emirates CEO Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum was hoping to order new A380s at the November 2017 Dubai Air Show. Emirates does not need the small front staircase and eleven-abreast economy of the A380plus concept, but wants Airbus to commit to continue production for at least 10 years.
On 18 January 2018, Airbus secured a preliminary agreement from Emirates for up to 36 A380s, to be delivered from 2020, valued at $16 billion at list prices. The contract was signed in February 2018, comprising a firm order for 20 A380s and options on 16 more.

In early 2019, Airbus confirmed it was in discussions with Emirates over its A380 contract. If the A380&#x27;s only stable client were to drop the type, Airbus could cease production of the superjumbo. Emirates was at odds with Rolls-Royce over shortfalls in fuel savings from the Trent 900s, and could switch its order for 36 A380s to the smaller A350. The A350 could also replace its provisional order for 40 Boeing 787-10s, placed in 2017, as engine margins on the 787 are insufficient for the hot Dubai weather.

On 14 February 2019, Emirates decided to cancel its order for 39 planes, opting to replace them with A350s and A330neos. Airbus stated that this cancellation would bring the A380&#x27;s production to an end when the last unfilled orders are delivered in 2021.

On 21 March 2019, All Nippon Airways received its first of three A380s painted with the Sea Turtle livery. Called the ANA Blue, this A380 will be used for 3 flights a week, going from Tokyo to Honolulu and back.

In October 2021, Emirates announced it would receive its final three A380s to be delivered with the last aircraft in December 2021, thus ending production of the A380.

==Aircraft on display==
* The fourth test A380 (MSN4) was donated to the Musée de l&#x27;air et de l&#x27;espace at Le Bourget in 2017. After several months of restoration, it was put on display on the apron in 2018, near the museum&#x27;s Boeing 747-100, making the museum the first in the world where both large airliners can be seen together.
* Donated by Airbus at the same time as A380 MSN4, the second test A380 (MSN2), was donated to the Aeroscopia museum at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, Toulouse, along with the first Airbus A320 and an Airbus A340, that had also previously been used by the company for test flights.

==Incidents==

The A380 has never been involved in a hull-loss accident , but was involved in two notable aviation accidents without any injuries, both of which were caused by uncontained engine failures:
* On 4 November 2010, Qantas Flight 32, en route from Singapore Changi Airport to Sydney Airport, suffered an uncontained engine failure, resulting in a series of related problems, and forcing the flight to make an emergency landing. The plane safely returned to Singapore. There were no injuries to the passengers, the crew, or people on the ground despite debris falling onto the Indonesian island of Batam. The damage to the aircraft was sufficient for the event to be classified as an accident. Qantas subsequently grounded all of its A380s that day subject to an internal investigation taken in conjunction with the engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce plc. A380s powered by the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines were affected, while those powered by the Engine Alliance GP7000 were not. Investigators determined that an oil leak, caused by a defective oil supply pipe, led to an engine fire and subsequent uncontained engine failure. Repairs cost an estimated 139 million (~US$145M). As other Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines also showed problems with the same oil leak, Rolls-Royce ordered many engines to be changed, including about half of the engines in the Qantas A380 fleet. During the aeroplane&#x27;s repair, cracks were discovered in wing structural fittings, which also resulted in mandatory inspections of all A380s and subsequent design changes.
* On 30 September 2017, Air France Flight 66, an Engine Alliance GP7270 powered Airbus A380, suffered an apparent uncontained engine failure while operating from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport to Los Angeles International Airport. The aircraft safely diverted to CFB Goose Bay, Canada.

<text>A thyristor (, from a combination of Greek language &quot;θύρα&quot;, meaning &quot;door&quot; or &quot;valve&quot;, and &quot;transistor&quot; ) is a solid-state semiconductor device which can be thought of as being a highly robust and switchable diode, allowing the passage of current in one direction but not the other, often under control of a gate electrode, that is used in high power applications like inverters and radar generators. It usually consists of four layers of alternating P- and N-type materials. It acts as a bistable switch (or a latch). There are two designs, differing in what triggers the conducting state. In a three-lead thyristor, a small current on its gate lead controls the larger current of the anode-to-cathode path. In a two-lead thyristor, conduction begins when the potential difference between the anode and cathode themselves is sufficiently large (breakdown voltage). The thyristor continues conducting until the voltage across the device is reverse-biased or the voltage is removed (by some other means), or through the control gate signal on newer types.

Some sources define &quot;silicon-controlled rectifier&quot; (SCR) and &quot;thyristor&quot; as synonymous. Other sources define thyristors as more complex devices that incorporate at least four layers of alternating N-type and P-type substrate.

The first thyristor devices were released commercially in 1956. Because thyristors can control a relatively large amount of power and voltage with a small device, they find wide application in control of electric power, ranging from light dimmers and electric motor speed control to high-voltage direct-current power transmission. Thyristors may be used in power-switching circuits, relay-replacement circuits, inverter circuits, oscillator circuits, level-detector circuits, chopper circuits, light-dimming circuits, low-cost timer circuits, logic circuits, speed-control circuits, phase-control circuits, etc. Originally, thyristors relied only on current reversal to turn them off, making them difficult to apply for direct current; newer device types can be turned on and off through the control gate signal. The latter is known as a gate turn-off thyristor, or GTO thyristor.

Unlike transistors, thyristors have a two-valued switching characteristic, meaning that a thyristor can only be fully on or off, while a transistor can lie in between on and off states. This makes a thyristor unsuitable as an analog amplifier, but useful as a switch.

== History ==

The silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) or thyristor proposed by William Shockley in 1950 and championed by Moll and others at Bell Labs was developed in 1956 by power engineers at General Electric (GE), led by Gordon Hall and commercialized by GE&#x27;s Frank W. &quot;Bill&quot; Gutzwiller. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers recognized the invention by placing a plaque at the invention site in Clyde, New York, and declaring it an IEEE Historic Milestone.

An earlier gas-filled tube device called a thyratron provided a similar electronic switching capability, where a small control voltage could switch a large current. It is from a combination of &quot;thyratron&quot; and &quot;transistor&quot; that the term &quot;thyristor&quot; is derived.

In recent years, some manufacturers have developed thyristors using silicon carbide (SiC) as the semiconductor material. These have applications in high temperature environments, being capable of operating at temperatures up to 350 °C.

== Design ==
The thyristor is a four-layered, three-terminal semiconductor device, with each layer consisting of alternating N-type or P-type material, for example P-N-P-N. The main terminals, labelled anode and cathode, are across all four layers. The control terminal, called the gate, is attached to p-type material near the cathode. (A variant called an SCS—silicon controlled switch—brings all four layers out to terminals.) The operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled bipolar junction transistors, arranged to cause a self-latching action.

Thyristors have three states:

# Reverse blocking mode: Voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode
# Forward blocking mode: Voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct, but the thyristor has not been triggered into conduction
# Forward conducting mode: The thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the &quot;holding current&quot;

=== Gate terminal ===
The thyristor has three p-n junctions (serially named J1, J2, J3 from the anode).

When the anode is at a positive potential VAK with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased, while junction J2 is reverse biased. As J2 is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if &quot;V&quot;AK is increased beyond the breakdown voltage &quot;V&quot;BO of the thyristor, avalanche breakdown of J2 takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).

If a positive potential &quot;V&quot;G is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode, the breakdown of the junction J2 occurs at a lower value of &quot;V&quot;AK. By selecting an appropriate value of &quot;V&quot;G, the thyristor can be switched into the on state quickly.

Once avalanche breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, irrespective of the gate voltage, until: (a) the potential &quot;V&quot;AK is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) becomes less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence &quot;V&quot;G can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a UJT relaxation oscillator.

The gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage (&quot;V&quot;GT) and gate trigger current (&quot;I&quot;GT). Gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate charge required to trigger the thyristor.

=== Switching characteristics ===
In a conventional thyristor, once it has been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current to remain in the on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (&quot;I&quot;L). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off unless the current drops below the holding current (&quot;I&quot;H). In normal working conditions the latching current is always greater than holding current. In the above figure &quot;IL&quot; has to come above the &quot;IH&quot; on y-axis since &quot;IL&quot;&gt;&quot;IH&quot;.

A thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased (a method known as natural, or line, commutation). In some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the anode of the first thyristor. This method is called forced commutation.

Once the current through the thyristor drops below the holding current, there must be a delay before the anode can be positively biased &quot;and&quot; retain the thyristor in the off-state. This minimum delay is called the circuit commutated turn off time (&quot;t&quot;Q). Attempting to positively bias the anode within this time causes the thyristor to be self-triggered by the remaining charge carriers (holes and electrons) that have not yet recombined.

For applications with frequencies higher than the domestic AC mains supply (e.g. 50 Hz or 60 Hz), thyristors with lower values of &quot;t&quot;Q are required. Such fast thyristors can be made by diffusing heavy metal ions such as gold or platinum which act as charge combination centers into the silicon. Today, fast thyristors are more usually made by electron or proton irradiation of the silicon, or by ion implantation. Irradiation is more versatile than heavy metal doping because it permits the dosage to be adjusted in fine steps, even at quite a late stage in the processing of the silicon.

=== Reverse conducting thyristor ===
A reverse conducting thyristor (RCT) has an integrated reverse diode, so is not capable of reverse blocking. These devices are advantageous where a reverse or freewheel diode must be used. Because the SCR and diode never conduct at the same time they do not produce heat simultaneously and can easily be integrated and cooled together. Reverse conducting thyristors are often used in frequency changers and inverters.

=== Photothyristors ===
Photothyristors are activated by light. The advantage of photothyristors is their insensitivity to electrical signals, which can cause faulty operation in electrically noisy environments. A light-triggered thyristor (LTT) has an optically sensitive region in its gate, into which electromagnetic radiation (usually infrared) is coupled by an optical fiber. Since no electronic boards need to be provided at the potential of the thyristor in order to trigger it, light-triggered thyristors can be an advantage in high-voltage applications such as HVDC. Light-triggered thyristors are available with in-built over-voltage (VBO) protection, which triggers the thyristor when the forward voltage across it becomes too high; they have also been made with in-built &quot;forward recovery protection&quot;, but not commercially. Despite the simplification they can bring to the electronics of an HVDC valve, light-triggered thyristors may still require some simple monitoring electronics and are only available from a few manufacturers.

Two common photothyristors include the light-activated SCR (LASCR) and the light-activated TRIAC. A LASCR acts as a switch that turns on when exposed to light. Following light exposure, when light is absent, if the power is not removed and the polarities of the cathode and anode have not yet reversed, the LASCR is still in the &quot;on&quot; state. A light-activated TRIAC resembles a LASCR, except that it is designed for alternating currents.

== Failure modes ==

Thyristor manufacturers generally specify a region of safe firing defining acceptable levels of voltage and current for a given operating temperature. The boundary of this region is partly determined by the requirement that the maximum permissible gate power (PG), specified for a given trigger pulse duration, is not exceeded.

As well as the usual failure modes due to exceeding voltage, current or power ratings, thyristors have their own particular modes of failure, including:
* Turn on di/dt: in which the rate of rise of on-state current after triggering is higher than can be supported by the spreading speed of the active conduction area (SCRs &amp; triacs).
* Forced commutation: in which the transient peak reverse recovery current causes such a high voltage drop in the sub-cathode region that it exceeds the reverse breakdown voltage of the gate cathode diode junction (SCRs only).
* Switch on dv/dt: the thyristor can be spuriously fired without trigger from the gate if the anode-to-cathode voltage rise-rate is too great.

== Applications ==
Thyristors are mainly used where high currents and voltages are involved, and are often used to control alternating currents, where the change of polarity of the current causes the device to switch off automatically, referred to as &quot;zero cross&quot; operation. The device can be said to operate &quot;synchronously&quot;; being that, once the device is triggered, it conducts current in phase with the voltage applied over its cathode to anode junction with no further gate modulation being required, i.e., the device is biased &quot;fully on&quot;. This is not to be confused with asymmetrical operation, as the output is unidirectional, flowing only from cathode to anode, and so is asymmetrical in nature.

Thyristors can be used as the control elements for phase angle triggered controllers, also known as phase fired controllers.

They can also be found in power supplies for digital circuits, where they are used as a sort of &quot;enhanced circuit breaker&quot; to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components. A thyristor is used in conjunction with a Zener diode attached to its gate, and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the Zener voltage, the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground (in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse). This kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar, and has the advantage over a standard circuit breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground from damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy (in the system being powered).

The first large-scale application of thyristors, with associated triggering diac, in consumer products related to stabilized power supplies within color television receivers in the early 1970s. The stabilized high voltage DC supply for the receiver was obtained by moving the switching point of the thyristor device up and down the falling slope of the positive going half of the AC supply input (if the rising slope was used the output voltage would always rise towards the peak input voltage when the device was triggered and thus defeat the aim of regulation). The precise switching point was determined by the load on the DC output supply, as well as AC input fluctuations.

Thyristors have been used for decades as light dimmers in television, motion pictures, and theater, where they replaced inferior technologies such as autotransformers and rheostats. They have also been used in photography as a critical part of flashes (strobes).

=== Snubber circuits ===

Thyristors can be triggered by a high rise-rate of off-state voltage. Upon increasing the off-state voltage across the anode and cathode of the thyristor, there will be a flow of charges similar to the charging current of a capacitor. The maximum rate of rise of off-state voltage or dV/dt rating of a thyristor is an important parameter since it indicates the maximum rate of rise of anode voltage that does not bring thyristor into conduction when no gate signal is applied. When the flow of charges due to rate of rise of off-state voltage across the anode and cathode of the thyristor becomes equal to the flow of charges as injected when the gate is energized then it leads to random and false triggering of thyristor which is undesired.

This is prevented by connecting a resistor-capacitor (RC) snubber circuit between the anode and cathode in order to limit the dV/dt (i.e., rate of voltage change over time). Snubbers are energy-absorbing circuits used to suppress the voltage spikes caused by the circuit&#x27;s inductance when a switch, electrical or mechanical, opens. The most common snubber circuit is a capacitor and resistor connected in series across the switch (transistor).

=== HVDC electricity transmission ===
Since modern thyristors can switch power on the scale of megawatts, thyristor valves have become the heart of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) conversion either to or from alternating current. In the realm of this and other very high-power applications, both electrically triggered (ETT) and light-triggered (LTT) thyristors are still the primary choice. Thyristors are arranged into a diode bridge circuit and to reduce harmonics are connected in series to form a 12-pulse converter. Each thyristor is cooled with deionized water, and the entire arrangement becomes one of multiple identical modules forming a layer in a multilayer valve stack called a &quot;quadruple valve&quot;. Three such stacks are typically mounted on the floor or hung from the ceiling of the valve hall of a long-distance transmission facility.

== Comparisons to other devices ==

The functional drawback of a thyristor is that, like a diode, it only conducts in one direction so it cannot be safely used with AC current. A similar self-latching 5-layer device, called a TRIAC, is able to work in both directions. This added capability, though, also can become a shortfall. Because the TRIAC can conduct in both directions, reactive loads can cause it to fail to turn off during the zero-voltage instants of the AC power cycle. Because of this, use of TRIACs with (for example) heavily inductive motor loads usually requires the use of a &quot;snubber&quot; circuit around the TRIAC to assure that it will turn off with each half-cycle of mains power. Inverse parallel SCRs can also be used in place of the triac; because each SCR in the pair has an entire half-cycle of reverse polarity applied to it, the SCRs, unlike TRIACs, are sure to turn off. The &quot;price&quot; to be paid for this arrangement, however, is the added complexity of two separate, but essentially identical gating circuits.

Although thyristors are heavily used in megawatt-scale rectification of AC to DC, in low- and medium-power (from few tens of watts to few tens of kilowatts) applications they have virtually been replaced by other devices with superior switching characteristics like power MOSFETs or IGBTs. One major problem associated with SCRs is that they are not fully controllable switches. The GTO thyristor and IGCT are two devices related to the thyristor that address this problem. In high-frequency applications, thyristors are poor candidates due to long switching times arising from bipolar conduction. MOSFETs, on the other hand, have much faster switching capability because of their unipolar conduction (only majority carriers carry the current).

<text>Acer rubrum, the red maple, also known as swamp maple, water maple, or soft maple, is one of the most common and widespread deciduous trees of eastern and central North America. The U.S. Forest Service recognizes it as the most abundant native tree in eastern North America. The red maple ranges from southeastern Manitoba around the Lake of the Woods on the border with Ontario and Minnesota, east to Newfoundland, south to Florida, and southwest to East Texas. Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity, it often attains a height around . Its flowers, petioles, twigs, and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.

Over most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in swamps, on poor, dry soils, and almost anywhere in between. It grows well from sea level to about . Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for maple syrup production and for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the state tree of Rhode Island. The red maple can be considered weedy or even invasive in young, highly disturbed forests, especially frequently logged forests. In a mature or old-growth northern hardwood forest, red maple only has a sparse presence, while shade-tolerant trees such as sugar maples, beeches, and hemlocks thrive. By removing red maple from a young forest recovering from disturbance, the natural cycle of forest regeneration is altered, changing the diversity of the forest for centuries to come.

== Description ==

Though &quot;A. rubrum&quot; is sometimes easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics. It is a medium to large sized tree, reaching heights of and exceptionally over in the southern Appalachians where conditions favor its growth. The leaves are usually long on a full-grown tree. The trunk diameter often ranges from ; depending on the growing conditions, however, open-grown trees can attain diameters of up to . The trunk remains free of branches until some distance up the tree on forest grown trees, while individuals grown in the open are shorter and thicker with a more rounded crown. Trees on poorer sites often become malformed and scraggly. Generally the crown is irregularly ovoid with ascending whip-like curved shoots. The bark is a pale grey and smooth when the individual is young. As the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates. The largest known living red maple is located near Armada, Michigan, at a height of and a bole circumference, at breast height, of .
The leaves of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives. As with all North American maple trees, they are deciduous and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically long and wide with three to five palmate lobes with a serrated margin. The sinuses are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation. When five lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the leaves of the related silver maple, &quot;A. saccharinum&quot;, are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed, and characteristically have five lobes. The upper side of &quot;A. rubrum&quot;″s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either glaucous or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to long. The leaves can turn a characteristic brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals. Soil acidity can influence the color of the foliage and trees with female flowers are more likely to produce orange coloration while male trees produce red. The fall colors of red maple are most spectacular in the northern part of its range where climates are cooler.
The twigs of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small lenticels. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition, collateral buds may be present, as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their large size and reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain three bundle scars.
The flowers are generally unisexual, with male and female flowers appearing in separate sessile clusters, though they are sometimes also bisexual. They appear in late winter to early spring, from December to May depending on elevation and latitude, usually before the leaves. The tree itself is considered polygamodioecious, meaning some individuals are male, some female, and some monoecious. Under the proper conditions, the tree can sometimes switch from male to female, male to hermaphroditic, and hermaphroditic to female. The red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old, but it significantly varies between tree to tree: some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old. The flowers are red with 5 small petals and a 5-lobed calyx, usually at the twig tips. The staminate flowers are sessile. The pistillate flowers are borne on pedicels that grow out while the flowers are blooming, so that eventually the flowers are in a hanging cluster with stems long. The petals are lineal to oblong in shape and are pubescent. The pistillate flowers have one pistil formed from two fused carpels with a glabrous superior ovary and two long styles that protrude beyond the perianth. The staminate flowers contain between 4 and 12 stamens, often with 8.

The fruit is a schizocarp of 2 samaras, each one long. Prior to dehiscence, the wings of the fruit are somewhat divergent at an angle of 50 to 60°. They are borne on long slender pedicels and are variable in color from light brown to reddish. They ripen from April through early June, before even the leaf development is altogether complete. After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1- to 2-week period from April through July.

&quot;Acer rubrum&quot; is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern North America. It can be found from the south of Newfoundland, through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and southern Quebec to the southwest west of Ontario, extreme southeastern Manitoba and northern Minnesota; southward through Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, eastern Oklahoma, and eastern Texas in its western range; and east to Florida. It has the largest continuous range along the North American Atlantic Coast of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges from north to south. The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the 95th meridian. The tree&#x27;s range ends where the mean minimum isotherm begins, namely in southeastern Canada. &quot;A. rubrum&quot; is not present in most of the Prairie Peninsula of the northern Midwest (although it is found in Ohio), the coastal prairie in southern Louisiana and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the Florida Everglades. Red maple&#x27;s western range stops with the Great Plains where conditions become too dry for it. The absence of red maple from the Prairie Peninsula is most likely due to the tree&#x27;s poor tolerance of wildfires. Red maple is most abundant in the Northeastern US, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northeastern Wisconsin, and is rare in the extreme west of its range and in the Southeastern US.

In several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats. An example is the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area. In the Northeastern US, red maple can be a climax forest species in certain locations, but will eventually give way to sugar maple.

&quot;A. rubrum&quot; does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, pH, and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America. &quot;A. rubrum&quot;&#x27;s high pH tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places, and it is widespread along the Eastern United States. It grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from granite, gneiss, schist, sandstone, shale, slate, conglomerate, quartzite, and limestone. Chlorosis can occur on very alkaline soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high. Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.

Red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps. While many types of tree prefer a south- or north-facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference. Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern Michigan and New England, the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps. Additionally, red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.

Red maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America. It only contributed minimally to old-growth upland forests, and would only form same-species stands in riparian zones. The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased six- to seven-fold, and this trend seems to be continuing, all of which is due to human factors, mainly loss of forest management by Native Americans who managed the forests to enhance acorn production and oak tree growth. This loss of management has been further enhanced by continued heavy logging and a recent trend of young, shrubby forests recovering from past human disturbances. Also, the decline of American elm and American chestnut due to introduced diseases has contributed to its spread. Red maple dominates such sites, but largely disappears until it only has a sparse presence by the time a forest is mature. This species is in fact a vital part of forest regeneration in the same way that paper birch is.

Because it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, &quot;A. rubrum&quot; is a prolific seed producer and highly adaptable, often dominating disturbed sites. While many believe that it is replacing historically dominant tree species in the Eastern United States, such as sugar maples, beeches, oaks, hemlocks and pines, red maple will only dominate young forests prone to natural or human disturbance. In areas disturbed by humans where the species thrives, it can reduce diversity, but in a mature forest, it is not a dominant species; it only has a sparse presence and adds to the diversity and ecological structure of a forest. Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species&#x27; numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate. Finally, disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US. While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil, more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple.

== Ecology ==
Red maple&#x27;s maximum lifespan is 150 years, but most live less than 100 years. The tree&#x27;s thin bark is easily damaged from ice and storms, animals, and when used in landscaping, being struck by flying debris from lawn mowers, allowing fungi to penetrate and cause heart rot. Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce roots to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short taproots with long, well-developed lateral roots; while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second-growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.
&quot;A. rubrum&quot; is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds. Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples. Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application.

The seeds are epigeal and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed forest canopy situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy. Though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above.

Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, for instance to Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.
Red maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after clearcutting a Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than . One of its associates, the black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential allelopathic inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow in their first year and up to each year for the next few years, making it a fast grower.
The red maple is used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in particular use the current season&#x27;s growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food, including larvae of the rosy maple moth (&quot;Dryocampa rubicunda&quot;); see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.

Due to &quot;A. rubrum&quot;″s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple&#x27;s range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of such variation, there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.
Red maple frequently hybridizes with silver maple; the hybrid, known as Freeman&#x27;s maple, &quot;Acer × freemanii&quot;, is intermediate between the parents.

=== Allergenic potential ===

The allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.

* &#x27;Red Sunset&#x27; (&#x27;Franksred&#x27;)

=== Toxicity ===
The leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but believed to be an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads to the production of methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700 grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.

== Cultivation ==
Red maple&#x27;s rapid growth, ease of transplanting, attractive form, and value for wildlife (in the eastern US) has made it one of the most extensively planted trees. In parts of the Pacific Northwest, it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and yards.

Red maple is a good choice of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an association with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than sugar maples, although the tree&#x27;s fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.

Red maples make vibrant and colorful bonsai, and have year around attractive features for display.

=== Cultivars ===
Numerous cultivars have been selected, often for intensity of fall color, with &#x27;October Glory&#x27; and &#x27;Red Sunset&#x27; among the most popular. Toward its southern limit, &#x27;Fireburst&#x27;, &#x27;Florida Flame&#x27;, and &#x27;Gulf Ember&#x27; are preferred. Many cultivars of the Freeman maple are also grown widely. Below is a partial list of cultivars:
*&#x27;Armstrong&#x27; – Columnar to fastigate in shape with silvery bark and modest orange to red fall foliage.
*&#x27;Autumn Blaze&#x27; – Rounded oval form with leaves that resemble the silver maple. The fall color is orange red and persists longer than usual.
*&#x27;Autumn Flame&#x27; – A fast grower with exceptional bright red fall color developing early. The leaves are also smaller than the species.
*&#x27;Autumn Radiance&#x27; – Dense oval crown with an orange-red fall color.
*&#x27;Autumn Spire&#x27; – Broad columnar crown; red fall color; very hardy.
*&#x27;Bowhall&#x27; – Conical to upright in form with a yellow-red fall color.
*&#x27;Burgundy Bell&#x27; – Compact rounded uniform shape with long lasting, burgundy fall leaves.
*&#x27;Columnare&#x27; – An old cultivar growing to with a narrow columnar to pyramidal form with dark green leaves turning orange and deep red in fall.
*&#x27;Gerling&#x27; – A compact, slow growing selection, this individual only reaches and has orange-red fall foliage.
*&#x27;Northwood&#x27; – Branches are at a 45 degree angle to the trunk, forming a rounded oval crown. Though the foliage is deep green in summer, its orange-red fall color is not as impressive as other cultivars.
*&#x27;October Brilliance&#x27; – This selection is slow to leaf in spring, but has a tight crown and deep red fall color.
*&#x27;October Glory&#x27; – Has a rounded oval crown with late developing intense red fall foliage. Along with &#x27;Red Sunset&#x27;, it is the most popular selection due to the dependable fall color and vigorous growth. This cultivar has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.
*&#x27;Redpointe&#x27; – Superior in alkaline soil, strong central leader, red fall color.
*&#x27;Red Sunset&#x27; – is also a recipient of the Award of Garden Merit. The other very popular choice, this selection does well in heat due to its drought tolerance and has an upright habit. It has very attractive orange-red fall color and is also a rapid and vigorous grower.
*&#x27;Scarlet Sentinel&#x27; – A columnar to oval selection with 5-lobed leaves resembling the silver maple. The fall color is yellow-orange to orange-red and the tree is a fast grower.
*&#x27;Schlesingeri&#x27; – A tree with a broad crown and early, long lasting fall color that is a deep red to reddish purple. Growth is also quite rapid. The original tree grew at the home of Barthold Schlesinger in Brookline, Massachusetts.
*&#x27;Shade King&#x27; – This fast growing cultivar has an upright-oval form with deep green summer leaves that turn red to orange in fall.
*&#x27;V.J. Drake&#x27; – This selection is notable because the edges of the leaves first turn a deep red before the color progresses into the center.

== Other uses ==

In the lumber industry &quot;Acer rubrum&quot; is considered a &quot;soft maple&quot;, a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (&quot;A. saccharinum&quot;). In this context, the term &quot;soft&quot; is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., &quot;soft maple&quot;, while softer than its harder cousin, sugar maple (&quot;A. saccharum&quot;), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;) in this regard. Like &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. However, the wood from &quot;Acer rubrum&quot; while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of &quot;curly&quot; (aka &quot;flame&quot;/&quot;fiddleback&quot;) figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.

Red maple is also used for the production of maple syrup, though the hard maples &quot;Acer saccharum&quot; (sugar maple) and &quot;Acer nigrum&quot; (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the &quot;Acer saccharinum&quot; (silver maple), &quot;Acer negundo&quot; (boxelder), and &quot;Acer platanoides&quot; (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.

Native Americans used red maple bark as a wash for inflamed eyes and cataracts, and as a remedy for hives and muscular aches. They also would brew tea from the inner bark to treat coughs and diarrhea. Pioneers made cinnamon-brown and black dyes from a bark extract, and iron sulphate could be added to the tannin from red maple bark in order to make ink.

Red maple is a medium quality firewood, possessing less heat energy, nominally , 
than other hardwoods such as ash: , oak: , or birch: .

<text>Choreography is the art of designing sequences of movements of physical bodies (or their depictions) in which motion or form or both are specified. &quot;Choreography&quot; may also refer to the design itself. A choreographer creates choreographies through the art of choreography, a process known as choreographing. It most commonly refers to dance choreography.

In dance, &quot;choreography&quot; may also refer to the design itself, sometimes expressed by means of dance notation. Dance choreography is sometimes called &quot;dance composition&quot;. Aspects of dance choreography include the compositional use of organic unity, rhythmic or non-rhythmic articulation, theme and variation, and repetition. The choreographic process may employ improvisation to develop innovative movement ideas. Generally, choreography designs dances intended to be performed as concert dance.

The art of choreography involves specifying human movement and form in terms of space, shape, time, and energy, typically within an emotional or non-literal context. Movement language is taken from dance techniques of ballet, contemporary dance, jazz, hip hop dance, folk dance, techno, K-pop, religious dance, pedestrian movement, or combinations of these.

==Etymology and history==

The word &quot;choreography&quot; literally means &quot;dance-writing&quot; from the Greek words &quot;χορεία&quot; (circular dance, see choreia) and &quot;γραφή&quot; (writing). It first appeared in the American English dictionary in the 1950s, and &quot;choreographer&quot; was first used as a credit for George Balanchine in the Broadway show &quot;On Your Toes&quot; in 1936. Before this, stage and movie credits used phrases such as &quot;ensembles staged by&quot;, &quot;dances staged by&quot;, or simply &quot;dances by&quot; to denote the choreographer.

In Renaissance Italy, dance masters created movements for social dances which were taught, while staged ballets were created similarly. In 16th century France, French court dances were developed in an artistic pattern. In the 17th and 18th centuries, social dance became more separated from theatrical dance performances. During this time the word &quot;choreography&quot; was applied to the written record of dances, which later became known as dance notation, with the meaning of &quot;choreography&quot; shifting to its current use as the composition of a sequence of movements making up a dance performance.

The ballet master or choreographer during this time became the &quot;arranger of dance as a theatrical art&quot;, with a well-known master of the late 18th century being Jean-Georges Noverre, with others following and developing techniques for specific types of dance, including Gasparo Angiolini, Jean Dauberval, Charles Didelot, and Salvatore Viganò. Ballet eventually developed its own vocabulary in the 19th century, and romantic ballet choreographers included Carlo Blasis, August Bournonville, Jules Perrot and Marius Petipa.

Modern dance brought a new, more naturalistic style of choreography, including by Russian choreographer Michel Fokine (1880-1942) and Isadora Duncan (1878-1927), and since then styles have varied between realistic representation and abstraction. Merce Cunningham, George Balanchine, and Sir Frederick Ashton were all influential choreographers of classical or abstract dance; Balanchine and Ashton, along with Martha Graham, Leonide Massine, Jerome Robbins and others also created representational works. Isadora Duncan favored natural movement and improvisation. The work of Alvin Ailey (1931-1989), an African-American dancer, choreographer, and activist, spanned many dance styles, including ballet, jazz, modern dance, and theatre.

==Dance choreography techniques==
Dances are designed by applying one or both of these fundamental choreographic methods:
* Improvisation, in which a choreographer provides dancers with a &quot;score&quot; (i.e., generalized directives) that serves as guidelines for improvised movement and form. For example, a score might direct one dancer to withdraw from another dancer, who in turn is directed to avoid the withdrawal, or it might specify a sequence of movements that are to be executed in an improvised manner over the course of a musical phrase, as in contra dance choreography. Improvisational scores typically offer wide latitude for personal interpretation by the dancer.
* Planned choreography, in which a choreographer dictates motion and form in detail, leaving little or no opportunity for the dancer to exercise personal interpretation.

Several underlying techniques are commonly used in choreography for two or more dancers:
* Mirroring - facing each other and doing the same
* Retrograde - performing a sequence of moves in reverse order
* Canon - people performing the same move one after the other
* Levels - people higher and lower in a dance
* Shadowing - standing one behind the other and performing the same moves
* Unison - two or more people doing a range of moves at the same time

Movements may be characterized by dynamics, such as fast, slow, hard, soft, long, and short.

==Choreography today==
Today, choreography must impose some kind of order on the performance, within the three dimensions of space, the fourth dimension of time, and the capabilities of the human body.

In the performing arts, choreography applies to human movement and form. In dance, choreography is also known as dance choreography or dance composition. Choreography is also used in other fields, including opera,
cheerleading, theatre, marching band, synchronized swimming, cinematography, ice skating, gymnastics, fashion shows, show choir, cardistry, video game production, and animated art.

==Competitions==
The International Choreographic Competition Hannover, Hanover, Germany, is the longest-running choreography competition in the world (started ), organised by the Ballett Gesellschaft Hannover e.V. It took place online during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, returning to the stage at the Theater am Aegi in 2022. Gregor Zöllig, head choreographer of dance at the Staatstheater Braunschweig was appointed artistic director of the competition in 2020. The main conditions of entry are that entrants must be under 40 years of age and professionally trained. The competition has been run in collaboration with the Tanja Liedtke Foundation since her death in 2008, and from 2021 a new production prize has been awarded by the foundation to complement the five other production awards. The 2021 and 2022 awards were presented by Marco Goecke, then director of ballet at the Staatstheater Hannover.

There are a number of other international choreography competitions, mostly focused on modern dance. These include:
*Beijing International Ballet and Choreography Competition, Beijing, China
*Contemporary Dance Platform, Cyprus, Greece
*Copenhagen International Choreography Competition, Copenhagen, Denmark (CICC), founded in 2008, annual 
*Helsinki Ballet Competition, Choreography Award, Helsinki, Finland
*International Choreographic Competition, Rome, Italy
*Moscow Ballet Competition and Contest for Choreographers, Moscow, Russia
*New Adventures Choreographer Award, London, UK
*Prix de la Danse de Montreal, Montreal, Canada
*Valentina Kozlova International Ballet Competition, Brussels, Belgium
*Varna International Ballet Competition, Choreography Award, Varna, Bulgaria

The International Online Dance Competition (IODC) was introduced in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a Grand Prix worth .

==Copyright Protection of Choreography==

Section 102(a)(4) of the Copyright Act protects “choreographic works” created after January 1, 1978, and fixed in a tangible medium of expression. Under copyright law, choreography is “the composition and arrangement of a related series of dance movements and patterns organized into a coherent whole.” Choreography consisting of ordinary motor activities, social dances, commonplace movements or gestures, or athletic movements may lack sufficient authorship to qualify for copyright protection.

A recent lawsuit was brought by professional dancer and choreographer Kyle Hanagami, who sued Epic Games, alleging that the video game developer copied a portion of Hanagami’s copyrighted dance moves in the popular game Fortnite. Hanagami published a YouTube video in 2017 featuring a dance he choreographed to the song &quot;How Long&quot; by Charlie Puth, and Hanagami claimed that Fortnite&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot; &quot;emote&quot; copied a portion of his &quot;How High&quot; choreography. Hanagami asserted claims for direct and contributory copyright infringement and unfair competition. Fortnite-maker Epic Games ultimately won dismissal of the copyright claims after the district court concluded that his two-second, four-beat sequence of dance steps was not protectable under copyright law.

<text>The BBC Light Programme was a national radio station which broadcast chiefly mainstream light entertainment and light music from 1945 until 1967, when it was replaced by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2. It opened on 29 July 1945, taking over the long wave frequency which had earlier been used – prior to the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939 – by the BBC National Programme.

The service was intended as a domestic replacement for the wartime BBC General Forces Programme which had gained many civilian listeners in Britain as well as members of the British Armed Forces.

==History==
The long wave signal on 200 kHz / 1500 metres was transmitted from Droitwich in the English Midlands (as it still is today for BBC Radio 4, although adjusted slightly to 198 kHz / 1515 metres from 1 February 1988) and gave fairly good coverage of most of the United Kingdom, although a number of low-power medium wave transmitters (using 1215 kHz / 247 metres) were added later to fill in local blank spots. Over the course of the 1950s and 1960s, the Light Programme (along with the BBC&#x27;s two other national stations – the BBC Home Service and the BBC Third Programme) gradually became available on what was known at the time as VHF, as the BBC developed a network of local FM transmitters.

From its first day of broadcasting in 1945 until Monday 2 September 1957, the Light Programme would be on the air from 9:00 am until midnight each day, apart from Sundays when it would come on the air at 8:00 am until 11:00 pm.

There was, however, a period of a year when the Light Programme was forced to end its broadcasting day one hour earlier at 11:00 pm. This commenced in mid-February 1947 as an effect from the appalling winter of 1946–1947 which saw a fuel shortage in the country with the government enforcing electricity saving measures, one of which was losing one hour of broadcasting per day from the Light Programme. Even after the fuel shortage had ended by spring 1947, the 11:00 pm closedown each night continued as BBC Radio found itself in financial problems and needed to save money. The midnight closedown of the Light Programme resumed one year later from Sunday 11 April 1948. The long-running soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot; was first heard nationally on the Light Programme on New Year&#x27;s Day 1951, although a week-long pilot version had been broadcast on the Midlands Home Service in 1950.

From Monday 2 September 1957, the Light Programme&#x27;s broadcasting hours would start to increase, with a new early morning start time of 7:00 am until midnight, later moving to 6:30 am from Monday 29 September 1958.

In 1964, broadcasting hours were increased even more, with a new morning start time of 5:30 am from Monday 31 August. Up until September 1964, the Light Programme would always end its broadcasting day at midnight; however this changed on Sunday 27 September 1964, when a new closedown time of 2:02 am was introduced.

The Light Programme closed down for the last time at 2:03 am on Saturday 30 September 1967. At 5:30 am, it was replaced by BBC Radio 2 and at 7:00 am by BBC Radio 1 on medium wave.

<text>Giovanni Carron (ca. 1570 – 1649) was the First Duke of Buttigliera Alta. He was conferred the title as well as the fiefdom of the area, on April 25, 1619. His family, the Carrons, originated from Savoy, and established themselves in Turin in 1600, at the Lascaris Palace.

Giovanni had four children: 
* Alessandro (whose only son died without leaving an heir);
* Nepumoceno;
* Costanza (married the marquese Massimo di Ceva and died childless);
* Celso, who was the father of Clementina Carron and Gerardo Carron. Clementina was the last of the Carron line.

<text>Bernardus Silvestris, also known as Bernard Silvestris and Bernard Silvester, was a medieval Platonist philosopher and poet of the 12th century.

==Biography==
Little is known about Bernardus&#x27;s life. In the nineteenth century, it was assumed that Bernardus was the same person as Bernard of Chartres, but the scholarly consensus is now that the two were different people. There is little evidence connecting Bernardus to Chartres, yet his work is consistent with the scholarship associated with Chartres in the twelfth century and is in that sense &quot;Chartrian&quot;. Bernardus dedicated his &quot;Cosmographia&quot; to Thierry of Chartres, who became chancellor of Chartres in 1141; he most likely wrote the letter in order to win the favour of a powerful figure, known for his interest in science.

André Vernet, who edited Bernardus&#x27; &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, believed that he lived from 1085 to 1178. The most secure date in his life is 1147–48, when the &quot;Cosmographia&quot; was supposedly read to Pope Eugene III, though it could have been finished before then, perhaps between 1143 and 1148. There is some evidence that Bernardus was connected to Spanish schools of philosophy, but it seems likely that he was born and taught in Tours, because of the intimate descriptions of the city and the surrounding area found in the &quot;Cosmographia&quot;. Later medieval authors also associated him with that city.

==Works==
Bernardus&#x27; greatest work is the aforementioned &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, a &quot;prosimetrum&quot; on the creation of the world, told from a 12th-century Platonist perspective. This work influenced Chaucer and others with its pioneering use of allegory to discuss metaphysical and scientific questions. Its Christian neo-Platonism was most clearly prefigured in the &quot;Periphyseon&quot; of the 9th-century Irish theologian John Scotus Eriugena.

Bernardus also wrote the poem &quot;Mathematicus&quot; and probably the poem &quot;Experimentarius&quot; as well as some minor poems. Among the works attributed to Bernardus later in the Middle Ages were a commentary on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (Bernardus&#x27; authorship of which has been questioned by modern scholars) and a commentary on Martianus Capella&#x27;s &quot;De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii&quot;. The commentary on the &quot;Aeneid&quot; is the longest medieval commentary on that work, although it is incomplete, ending about two-thirds of the way through book six.

===Authorship of &quot;Aeneid&quot; commentary===
Julian Ward Jones, Jr., in his article &quot;The So-Called Silvestris Commentary on the Aeneid and Two Other Interpretations&quot;, attempts to clear up the issue of the authorship of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; commentary by distinguishing two distinct positions: the first by E. R. Smits, and the second by Christopher Baswell. Smits&#x27;s account is rejected by Jones, who says that Baswell&#x27;s account is mostly correct but requires some modification.

E. R. Smits, like André Vernet (1938), hypothesizes that Carnotensis (the pen-name of the commentary) is Bernard of Chartres – the individual who Silvestris is most confused with. Vernet says that Silvestris, for whom this confusion was normally detrimental, probably gained from this particular confusion, as he is most often credited for the commentary on Vergil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Smits and Vernet attribute Bernard of Chartres&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Aeneid&quot; commentary to a number of similarities and differences between this work and other texts.

On the other hand, Christopher Baswell attempts to interpret the &quot;Aeneid&quot; commentary through comparison to a commentary in Cambridge manuscript Peterhouse 158, seeing this as an important link between manuscripts of the commentary and the Silvestris commentary. By placing the passages in two columns, Baswell shows that the interpretations are congruent, although the notes in the Peterhouse MS appear to be shortened and simpler versions of notes in the Silvestris commentary. Baswell concludes that the Peterhouse MS represents an earlier version by Silvestris. Jones sets this conclusion aside, citing differences that in his opinion are more important than the striking similarities. By pointing to differences in organization among other things, Jones casts doubt on Baswell&#x27;s hypothesis. Although Baswell and Jones both see Silvestris as the &quot;Aeneid&quot; commentator, Jones does not agree with the connection to the Peterhouse MS.

==Influence and contributions==
The &quot;Cosmographia&quot; influenced Chaucer and others with its pioneering use of allegory to discuss metaphysical and scientific questions. Theodore Silverstein praises Silvestris&#x27; works for their imaginative prose, as well as for positioning himself well in literature based on the time and place—particularly in the writing of the &quot;Cosmographia&quot; during the 12th-century controversies of evolution. In the Catholic Encyclopedia, William Turner wrote that there was a &quot;pantheistic drift&quot; to his philosophy.

There is evidence of influence in the works of medieval and renaissance authors, including Hildegard of Bingen, St. Bonaventure, Vincent of Beauvais, Dante, Chaucer, Nicolas of Cusa, and Boccaccio. In the modern era, Bernardus Silvestris has been referred to in the nonfiction and science fiction work of C. S. Lewis.

<text>Quercus velutina (Latin &#x27;velutina&#x27;, &quot;velvety&quot;) , the black oak, is a species of oak in the red oak group (&quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot;), native and widespread in eastern and central North America. It is sometimes called the eastern black oak.

&quot;Quercus velutina&quot; was previously known as yellow oak due to the yellow pigment in its inner bark. It is a close relative of the California black oak (&quot;Quercus kelloggii&quot;) found in western North America.

==Description==
In the northern part of its range, &quot;Quercus velutina&quot; is a relatively small tree, reaching a height of and a diameter of , but it grows larger in the south and center of its range, where heights of up to are known.

The leaves of the black oak are alternately arranged on the twig and are long with 5–7 bristle-tipped lobes separated by deep U-shaped notches. The upper surface of the leaf is a shiny deep green, and the lower is yellowish-brown. There are also stellate hairs on the underside of the leaf that grow in clumps. Some key characteristics for identification include that leaves grown in the sun have very deep U-shaped sinuses and that the buds are velvety and covered in white hairs.

Black oak is monoecious. The staminate flowers develop from leaf axils of the previous year and the catkins emerge before or at the same time as the current leaves in April or May. The pistillate flowers are borne in the axils of the current year&#x27;s leaves and may be solitary or occur in two- to many-flowered spikes. The fruit, an acorn that occurs singly or in clusters of two to five, is about one-third enclosed in a scaly cup and matures in 2 years. Black oak acorns are brown when mature and ripen from late August to late October, depending on geographic location.

The fruits or acorns of the black oak are medium-sized and broadly rounded. The cap is large and covers almost half of the nut.

==Habitat and distribution==

Black oak is found in all the coastal states from Maine to Texas, inland as far as Michigan, Ontario, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and eastern Texas.

It grows on all aspects and slope positions. It grows best in coves and on middle and lower slopes with northerly and easterly aspects. It is found at elevations up to in the southern Appalachians. In southern New England, black oak grows on cool, moist soils. Elsewhere it occurs on warm, moist soils.
The most widespread soils on which black oak grows are the udalfs and udolls. These soils are derived from glacial materials, sandstones, shales, and limestone and range from heavy clays to loamy sands with some having a high content of rock or chert fragments. Black oak grows best on well drained, silty clay to loam soils.

The most important factors determining site quality for black oak are the thickness and texture of the A horizon, texture of the B horizon, aspect, and slope position. Other factors may be important in localized areas. For example, in northwestern West Virginia increasing precipitation to resulted in increased site quality; more than had no further effect. In southern Indiana, decreasing site quality was associated with increasing slope steepness.

Near the limits of its range, topographic factors may restrict its distribution. At the western limits black oak is often found only on north and east aspects where moisture conditions are most favorable. In southern Minnesota and Wisconsin it is usually found only on ridge tops and the lower two-thirds of south- and west-facing slopes.

==Ecology==

=== Associated plant species ===
Common tree associates of black oak are white oak (&quot;Quercus alba&quot;), northern red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra&quot;), pignut hickory (&quot;Carya glabra&quot;), mockernut hickory (&quot;C. tomentosa&quot;), bitternut hickory (&quot;C. cordiformis&quot;), and shagbark hickory (&quot;C. ovata&quot;); American elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;) and slippery elm (&quot;U. rubra&quot;); white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;); black walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra&quot;) and butternut (&quot;J. cinerea&quot;); scarlet oak (&quot;Quercus coccinea&quot;), southern red oak (&quot;Q. falcata&quot;), and chinkapin oak (&quot;Q. muehlenbergii&quot;); red maple (&quot;Acer rubrum&quot;) and sugar maple (&quot;A. saccharum&quot;); black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;); and blackgum (&quot;Nyssa sylvatica&quot;).

Common small tree associates of black oak include flowering dogwood (&quot;Cornus florida&quot;), sourwood (&quot;Oxydendrum arboreum&quot;), sassafras (&quot;Sassafras albidum&quot;), eastern hophornbeam (&quot;Ostrya virginiana&quot;), redbud (&quot;Cercis canadensis&quot;), pawpaw (&quot;Asimina triloba&quot;), downy serviceberry (&quot;Amelanchier arborea&quot;), and American bladdernut (&quot;Staphylea trifolia&quot;). Common shrubs include &quot;Vaccinium&quot; spp., mountain-laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), witch-hazel (&quot;Hamamelis virginiana&quot;), beaked hazel (&quot;Corylus cornuta&quot;), spicebush (&quot;Lindera benzoin&quot;), sumac (&quot;Rhus&quot; spp.), and &quot;Viburnum&quot; spp. The most common vines are greenbrier (&quot;Smilax&quot; spp.), grape (&quot;Vitis&quot; spp.), poison-ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;), and Virginia creeper (&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot;).

Black oak is often a predominant species in the canopy of an oak–heath forest.

=== Seed production and dissemination ===

In forest stands, black oak begins to produce seeds at about age 20 and reaches optimum production at 40 to 75 years. It is a consistent seed producer with good crops of acorns every 2 to 3 years. In Missouri, the average number of mature acorns per tree was generally higher than for other oaks over a 5-year period, but the number of acorns differed greatly from year to year and from tree to tree within the same stand.

The number of seeds that become available for regenerating black oak may be low even in good seed years. Insects, squirrels, deer, turkey, small rodents, and birds consume many acorns. They can eat or damage a high percentage of the acorn crop in most years and essentially all of it in poor seed years.

Black oak acorns from a single tree are dispersed over a limited area by squirrels, mice, and gravity. The blue jay may disperse over longer distances.

=== Response to competition ===

Black oak is classed as intermediate in tolerance to shade. It is less tolerant than many of its associates such as white and chestnut oaks, hickories, beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), maples, elm, and blackgum. However, it is more tolerant than yellow-poplar (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), black cherry, and shortleaf pine (&quot;Pinus echinata&quot;). It is about the same as northern red oak and scarlet oak. Seedlings usually die within a few years after being established under fully stocked over stories. Most black oak sprouts under mature stands develop crooked stems and flat-topped or misshapen crowns. After the over story is removed, only the large stems are capable of competing successfully. Seedlings are soon overtopped. The few that survive usually remain in the intermediate crown class.

Even-aged silvicultural systems satisfy the reproduction and growth requirements of black oak better than the all-aged or uneven-aged selection system. Under the selection system, black oak is unable to reproduce because of inadequate light. Stands containing black oak that are managed under the selection system will gradually be dominated by more shade-tolerant species.

Dormant buds are numerous on the boles of black oak trees. These buds may be stimulated to sprout and produce branches by mechanical pruning or by exposure to greatly increased light, as by thinning heavily or creating openings in the stand. Dominant trees are less likely to produce epicormic branches than those in the lower crown class.

=== Damaging agents ===

Wildfires seriously damage black oak trees by killing the cambium at the base of the trees. This creates an entry point for decay fungi. The result is loss of volume because of heart rot. Trees up to pole size are easily killed by fire and severe fires may even kill saw timber. Many of the killed trees sprout and form a new stand. However, the economic loss may be large unless at least some of it can be salvaged.

Oak wilt (&quot;Bretziella fagacearum&quot;) is a potentially serious vascular disease of black oak that is widespread throughout the eastern United States. Trees die within a few weeks after the symptoms first appear. Usually scattered individuals or small groups of trees are killed, but areas several hectares in size may be affected. The disease is spread from tree to tree through root grafts and over larger distances by sap-feeding beetles (Nitidulidae) and the small oak bark beetle.

Shoestring root rot (&quot;Armillaria mellea&quot;) attacks black oak and may kill trees weakened by fire, lightning, drought, insects, or other diseases. A root rot, &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, may kill seedlings in the nursery. Cankers caused by &quot;Strumella&quot; and &quot;Nectria&quot; species damage the holes of black oak but seldom kill trees. Foliage diseases that attack black oak are the same as those that typically attack species in the red oak group and include anthracnose (&quot;Gnomonia quercina&quot;), leaf blister (&quot;Taphrina&quot; spp.), powdery mildews (&quot;Phyllactinia corylea&quot; and &quot;Microsphaera alni&quot;), oak-pine rusts (&quot;Cronartium&quot; spp.), and leaf spots (&quot;Actinopelte dryina&quot;).

Tunneling insects that attack the boles of black oak and cause serious lumber degrade include the carpenter worm (&quot;Prionoxystus robiniae&quot;), red oak borer (&quot;Enaphalodes rufulus&quot;), the twolined chestnut borer (&quot;Agrilus bilineatus&quot;), the oak timber worm (&quot;Arrenodes minutus&quot;), and the Columbian timber beetle (&quot;Corthylus columbianus&quot;).

The gypsy moth (&quot;Lymantria dispar&quot;) feeds on foliage and is potentially the most destructive insect. Although black oaks withstood a single defoliation, two or three defoliations in successive years kill many trees. Other defoliators that attack black oak and may occasionally be epidemic are the variable oak leaf caterpillar (&quot;Heterocampa manteo&quot;), the orange striped oakworm (&quot;Anisota senatoria&quot;), and the brown tail moth (&quot;Euproctis chrysorrhoea&quot;).

The nut weevils (&quot;Curculio&quot; spp.), gall-forming cynipids (&quot;Callirhytis&quot; spp.), filbertworm (&quot;Melissopus latiferreanus&quot;), and acorn moth (&quot;Valentinia glandulella&quot;) damage black oak acorns.

==Named hybrids involving black oak==
Black oak is well known to readily hybridize with other members of the red oak (&quot;Quercus&quot; sect. &quot;Lobatae&quot;) group, being one parent in at least a dozen different named hybrids.

<doc id="181203" wikidata="Q1042398" url="?curid=181203" title="Paranoia (role-playing game)">
<text>Paranoia is a dystopian science-fiction tabletop role-playing game originally designed and written by Greg Costikyan, Dan Gelber, and Eric Goldberg, and first published in 1984 by West End Games. Since 2004 the game has been published under license by Mongoose Publishing. The game won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Rules of 1984 and was inducted into the Origins Awards Hall of Fame in 2007. &quot;Paranoia&quot; is notable among tabletop games for being more competitive than co-operative, with players encouraged to betray one another for their own interests, as well as for keeping a light-hearted, tongue in cheek tone despite its dystopian setting.

Several editions of the game have been published since the original version, and the franchise has spawned several spin-offs, novels and comic books based on the game.

==Premise==
The game is set in a dystopian future city controlled by the Computer (also known as &quot;Friend Computer&quot;), and where information (including the game rules) are restricted by color-coded &quot;security clearance&quot;. Player characters are initially enforcers of the Computer&#x27;s authority (known as Troubleshooter, mainly for the fact that they shoot trouble), and will be given missions to seek out and eliminate threats to the Computer&#x27;s control. The player characters are also part of prohibited underground movements (which means that the players&#x27; characters are usually &quot;included&quot; among the aforementioned &#x27;security threats&#x27;), and will have secret objectives including theft from and murder of other player characters.

==Tone==
&quot;Paranoia&quot; is a humorous role-playing game set in a dystopian future along the lines of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, and &quot;THX 1138&quot;; however, the tone of the game is rife with black humor, frequently tongue-in-cheek rather than dark and heavy. Most of the game&#x27;s humor is derived from the players&#x27; (usually futile) attempts to complete their assignment while simultaneously adhering to the Computer&#x27;s arbitrary, contradictory and often nonsensical security directives.

The &quot;Paranoia&quot; rulebook is unusual in a number of ways; demonstrating any knowledge of the rules is forbidden, and most of the rulebook is written in an easy, conversational tone that often makes fun of the players and their characters, while occasionally taking digs at other notable role-playing games.

===Setting===
The game&#x27;s main setting is an immense, futuristic city called Alpha Complex. Alpha Complex is controlled by the Computer, a civil service AI construct (a literal realization of the &quot;Influencing Machine&quot; that some schizophrenics fear). The Computer serves as the game&#x27;s principal antagonist, and fears a number of threats to its &#x27;perfect&#x27; society, such as the Outdoors, mutants, and secret societies (especially Communists). To deal with these threats, the Computer employs &quot;Troubleshooters&quot;, whose job is to go out, find trouble, and shoot it. Player characters are usually Troubleshooters, although later game supplements have allowed the players to take on other roles, such as High-Programmers of Alpha Complex.

The player characters frequently receive mission instructions from the Computer that are incomprehensible, self-contradictory, or obviously fatal if adhered to, and side-missions (such as Mandatory Bonus Duties) that conflict with the main mission. Failing a mission generally results in termination of the player character, but succeeding can just as often result in the same fate, after being rewarded for successfully concluding the mission. They are issued equipment that is uniformly dangerous, faulty, or &quot;experimental&quot; (i.e., almost certainly dangerous &quot;and&quot; faulty). Additionally, each player character is generally an unregistered mutant and a secret society member (which are both termination offenses in Alpha Complex), and has a hidden agenda separate from the group&#x27;s goals, often involving stealing from or killing teammates. Thus, missions often turn into a comedy of errors, as everyone on the team seeks to double-cross everyone else while keeping their own secrets. The game&#x27;s manual encourages suspicion between players, offering several tips on how to make the gameplay as paranoid as possible.

Every player&#x27;s character is assigned six clones, known as a &quot;six-pack&quot;, which are used to replace the preceding clone upon his or her death. The game lacks a conventional health system; most wounds the player characters can suffer are assumed to be fatal. As a result, &quot;Paranoia&quot; allows characters to be routinely killed, yet the player can continue instead of leaving the game. This easy spending of clones tends to lead to frequent firefights, gruesome slapstick, and the horrible yet humorous demise of most if not all of the player character&#x27;s clone family. Additional clones can be purchased if one gains sufficient favour with the Computer.

===Security clearances===
&quot;Paranoia&quot; features a security clearance system based on colors of the visible spectrum which heavily restricts what the players can and cannot legally do; everything from corridors to food and equipment have security restrictions. The lowest rating is Infrared, but the lowest playable security clearance is Red; the game usually begins with the characters having just been promoted to Red grade. Interfering with anything which is above that player&#x27;s clearance carries significant risk.

The full order of clearances from lowest to highest is Infrared (visually represented by black), Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet, and Ultraviolet (visually represented by white). Within the game, Infrared-clearance citizens live dull lives of mindless drudgery and are heavily medicated, while higher clearance characters may be allowed to demote or even summarily execute those of a lower rank and those with Ultraviolet clearance are almost completely unrestricted and have a great deal of access to the Computer; they are the only citizens that may (legally) access and modify the Computer&#x27;s programming, and thus Ultraviolet citizens are also referred to as &quot;High Programmers&quot;. Security clearance is not related to competence but is instead the result of the Computer&#x27;s often insane and unjustified calculus of trust concerning a citizen. It is suggested that it may in fact be the High Programmers&#x27; meddling with The Computer&#x27;s programming that resulted in its insanity.

===Secret societies===
In the game, secret societies tend to be based on sketchy and spurious knowledge of historical matters. For example, previous editions included societies such as the &quot;Seal Club&quot; that idolizes the Outdoors but is unsure what plants and animals actually look like. Other societies include the Knights of the Circular Object (based on the Knights of the Round Table), the Trekkies, and the First Church of Christ Computer Programmer. In keeping with the theme of paranoia, many secret societies have spies or double agents in each other&#x27;s organizations. The 1st edition also included secret societies such as Programs Groups (the personal agents and spies of the High Programmers at the apex of Alpha Complex society) and Spy For Another Alpha Complex.

The actual societies which would be encountered in a game depends on the play style; some societies are more suited for more light-hearted games (Zap-style, or the lighter end of Classic), whereas others represent a more serious threat to Alpha Complex and are therefore more suitable for Straight or the more dark sort of Classic games.

==Publication history==
Six editions have been published. Three of these were published by West End Games - the 1st, 2nd, and &quot;Fifth&quot; Editions - whereas the later three editions (&quot;Paranoia XP&quot;, the 25th Anniversary edition and the &quot;Red Clearance&quot; edition) were published by Mongoose Publishing. In addition to these six published editions, it is known that West End Games were working on a &quot;Third Edition&quot; - to replace the poorly received Fifth Edition - in the late 1990s, but their financial issues would prevent this edition from being published, except for being included in one tournament adventure.

===1st edition===
1st edition was written by Greg Costikyan, Dan Gelber, and Eric Goldberg - published in 1984 by West End Games. In 1985, this edition of &quot;Paranoia &quot;won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Roleplaying Rules of 1984&quot;. This edition, while encouraging dark humour in-game, took a fairly serious dystopian tone; the supplements and adventures released to accompany it emphasised the lighter side, however, establishing the freewheeling mix of slapstick, intra-team backstabbing and satire that is classically associated with a game of &quot;Paranoia&quot;.

===2nd edition===

2nd edition credited to Costikyan, Gelber, Goldberg, Ken Rolston, and Paul Murphy was published in 1987 by West End Games. This edition can be seen as a response to the natural development of the line towards a rules-light, fast and entertaining play style. Here, the humorous possibilities of life in a paranoid dystopia are emphasised, and the rules are simplified.

====Metaplot and the Second Edition====
Many of the supplements released for the Second edition fall into a story arc set up by new writers and line editors that was intended to freshen up the game and broaden roleplay possibilities. Players could travel in space and time, play in a Computerless Alpha Complex, or an Alpha Complex in which Computer battled for control with other factions. Some fans criticized the change to the default narrative. Second edition supplements can generally be divided into four eras:
# Classic: No metaplot.
# Secret Society Wars: Introduced in &quot;The DOA Sector Travelogue&quot;, and supported by a series of &quot;Secret Society Wars&quot; modules. Individual missions can be run in the Classic format, but running themes and conspiracies persist from book to book.
# The Crash: Detailed in the &quot;Crash Course Manual&quot;, and supported by the &quot;Vulture Warriors of Dimension X&quot; series of time-travelling modules. Adventures occur in a fractured Complex in which there is no Computer, possibly as a result of the Secret Society Wars, possibly not.
# Reboot: Detailed in &quot;The Paranoia Sourcebook&quot;, and supported by a few modules and supplements. The Computer returns, but does not control all of Alpha Complex - plays as a hybrid of the other eras, with players free to choose sides.

===&quot;Fifth&quot; Edition===

&quot;Fifth Edition&quot; was published in 1995 by West End Games. It was the third edition of the game released; two editions were skipped as a joke, and possibly also as a reference to the two major revisions to the game released during the lifetime of the Second Edition with the Crash Course Manual and the Paranoia Sourcebook. It has since been declared an &quot;un-product&quot; by the writers of the current edition, due to its extremely poor commercial and critical reception. Almost none of the original production staff were involved, and the books in this line focused less on the dark humor and oppressive nature of Alpha, and more on cheap pop culture spoofs, such as a &quot;&quot; parody. It had a lighter and sillier atmosphere and fans and more cartoonish illustrations.

In his introduction to &quot;Flashbacks&quot;, a compilation of &quot;Paranoia&quot; adventures from the West End Games era, Allen Varney details the management decisions which led, in the eyes of many, to the decline of the &quot;Paranoia &quot;line, and cites rumours that the line saw a 90% decline in sales before West End Games went into bankruptcy:

Art director Larry Catalano left West End in 1986. Catalano’s successor fired (illustrator) Jim Holloway and brought in a succession of increasingly poor cartoonists. (Writer/editor) Ken Rolston left shortly thereafter for unrelated reasons. In Ken’s wake, developers Doug Kaufman and Paul Murphy in turn briefly supervised the Paranoia line. After they too departed, editorial control fell to—how do I put this tactfully?—people with different views of the Paranoia line.
===Unreleased West End Games Third Edition===
Following the unfavorable reception of the Fifth Edition, West End Games began planning a new edition of the game, which would be released as the &quot;Third Edition&quot;. Pages from this planned edition were exhibited at Gen Con in 1997 - two years after the release of the Fifth Edition. Due to West End Games&#x27; financial problems this edition was never completed. In an interview in 1999 Scott Palter of West End expressed hopes that the Third Edition would be published that summer; however, he also disclosed that court proceedings had been begun by the original designers in order to reclaim the rights to the game. The designers did succeed in purchasing the rights to the game, putting an end to any possibility that the final West End Games edition would be released.

A single adventure has surfaced which contained a summary of the third edition rules.

===&quot;Paranoia XP&quot;===

Following the bankruptcy of West End Games, the original designers of &quot;Paranoia&quot; banded together and purchased the rights to the game from West End in order to regain control of the line. The designers in turn granted a license to Mongoose Publishing to produce a new version of the game, with the result that &quot;Paranoia XP&quot;, written by Allen Varney, Aaron Allston, Paul Baldowski, Beth Fischi, Dan Curtis Johnson and Greg Costikyan, was published in 2004. In 2005, Microsoft requested that the &#x27;XP&#x27; be removed. As such, the name was shortened to just &quot;Paranoia&quot;. This edition of the game has received a much warmer critical reception, as well as selling well.

This edition also introduced three different styles of play, with some game mechanics differing between the various modes to support the specific tone being sought-after:
* Zap is anarchic slapstick with no claims to making sense and little effort at satire. Zap represents &quot;Paranoia&quot; as popularly understood: troubleshooters who open fire on each other with little to no provocation. It is often associated with the &quot;Fifth Edition&quot;. Best for a one-shot game of Paranoia.
* Classic is the atmosphere associated with the 2nd edition. Conflict within troubleshooter teams is less common and less lethal. Good for a one-shot game of Paranoia, but still suitable for an ongoing campaign.
* Straight represents a relatively new style. This is more serious and focuses more on dark, complex satire. Players are punished for executing other characters without first filing evidence of the other character&#x27;s treason; this encourages slower, more careful gameplay and discourages random firefights and horseplay. Poor for one-shots, good for an ongoing campaign.

Primary designer Allen Varney, in the designer&#x27;s notes, explained that his aim with the new edition was to return to the game&#x27;s roots whilst updating both the game system and the satirical setting to take account of twenty years of game design progress. In both the core rulebook and the &quot;Flashbacks&quot; supplement - a reprint of classic adventures originally published by West End Games - Varney was highly critical of West End Games&#x27; handling of the product line in its latter days. In a posting on RPG.net he explained that the point of including the three playstyles in &quot;Paranoia XP&quot; was to counteract the impression that &quot;Zap&quot;-styled play was the default for &quot;Paranoia&quot;, an impression which had in part been created by the more cartoonish later supplements in the West End Games line (as well as &quot;Fifth Edition&quot;).

In order to distance the new edition from the less commercially and critically successful aspects of the West End Game line, and to discourage new players from wasting time and money on what he considered to be inferior products, Varney additionally used the designer&#x27;s notes to declare many West End products, including the &quot;Fifth Edition&quot; and everything published for the 2nd Edition after &quot;The People&#x27;s Glorious Revolutionary Adventure&quot;, to be &quot;unproducts&quot; - no longer part of the game&#x27;s continuity, and not recommended for use with the new edition. An upshot of this is that much of the poorly received metaplot established late in the West End Games line, from the Secret Society Wars to the Reboot and beyond, was disposed of. Varney has explained that this is due mainly to his distaste for the direction the metaplot took the game line in, a distaste he asserts is shared by the game&#x27;s fan community. He has also stated that he personally has little affection for the &quot;Zap&quot; style, and therefore may have given it short shrift in the main rulebook, although later supplements for &quot;Paranoia XP&quot; did provide more support for Zap play.

Long-time &quot;Paranoia&quot; artist Jim Holloway, called &quot;the master of the fun-filled illustration&quot;, drew the cover art and much of the internal art for the game until 1986. His art for the series generally portray comedic scenarios that capture the essential &quot;deathtrap&quot; feeling of Alpha Complex. &quot;Paranoia XP&quot; marked his return to the line as well; he designed every cover of the XP edition, and many books contain both his classic and new &quot;Paranoia&quot; art.

While &quot;Paranoia XP&quot; kept Communists as the big bad scapegoat in spite of the Cold War being long over, the updated edition integrates several 21st-century themes into its satire. Troubleshooters carry PDCs (Personal Digital Companion) that are reminiscent of Personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones and can try to acquire gear by bidding on CBay (an obvious pun on eBay). New threats to Alpha Complex include file sharing, phishing scams, identity theft and weapons of mass destructions. Consumerism in Alpha Complex has been tooled into its economy and has taken on an element of patriotism, echoing sentiments expressed after 9/11 along similar trends. A mission pack released in 2009 titled &quot;War On (Insert Noun)&quot; lampoons government initiatives like the War on Drugs and the War on Terror.

In writing the new edition, Varney, Goldberg and Costikyan reached out to and actively collaborated with the &quot;Paranoia&quot; online fan community through an official blog and through Paranoia-Live.net. In addition, Varney ran an online game, the &quot;Toothpaste Disaster&quot;, where players took the role of High Programmers documenting the titular disaster in a Lexicon format. Many ideas established in the &quot;Lexicon&quot; game were written into the rulebook. Later, some of the best players and writers from the game and a few other places were formally integrated as the Traitor Recycling Studio to write official &quot;Paranoia&quot; material; their first credited work was the mission supplement &quot;Crash Priority&quot;.

In 2006, Varney&#x27;s fellow &quot;Paranoia&quot; writer, Mongoose Publishing employee Gareth Hanrahan, took over as primary writer for the &quot;Paranoia&quot; line. During the lifetime of the XP line Mongoose released numerous supplements and adventures for the game. Notable amongst the supplements was &quot;Extreme Paranoia&quot;, which provided ideas for scenarios based around characters of security clearances Orange to Violet, with premises differing greatly from the standard Red-clearance Troubleshooter concept but remaining thematically appropriate to the game&#x27;s setting and atmosphere. (This included an updated reprint of the 1st Edition supplement &quot;HIL Sector Blues&quot;, which focused on playing Blue-clearance IntSec agents.) The idea of devising new and varied concepts to base &quot;Paranoia&quot; adventures and campaigns around would be revisited for the next edition of the game.

===25th Anniversary Editions===
In June 2009, Mongoose Publishing announced that they would be retiring the books in the XP line to clear the way for the 25th Anniversary Edition line - revealing a new edition of the rulebook as well as two new rulebooks, one casting the players as higher-clearance Internal Security investigators and one as Ultraviolet High Programmers. They stated that the &quot;XP &quot;material would &quot;maintain a 90% compatibility rating with the new &quot;Paranoia &quot;books&quot;.

Each of the three books is an entirely self-contained and playable game: &quot;Paranoia: Troubleshooters&quot;, &quot;Paranoia: Internal Security&quot;, and &quot;Paranoia: High Programmers&quot;. The &quot;Troubleshooters&quot; volume presents a slimmed-down version of the &quot;XP &quot;rules, the most notable difference being the removal of the Service Firms and the advanced economy of the &quot;XP &quot;edition, with the focus firmly on the game&#x27;s traditional premise of casting the player characters as Red-clearance Troubleshooters. The &quot;Internal Security&quot; volume casts the player characters as Blue-clearance Internal Security agents, a refinement of the premise of the 1st edition supplement &quot;HIL Sector Blues&quot; (reprinted in the &quot;XP &quot;line as part of &quot;Extreme Paranoia&quot;). The third game, &quot;Paranoia: High Programmers&quot;, casts the player characters as the Ultraviolet-clearance elite of Alpha Complex society and focuses on the political plotting and infighting that dominates the High Programmers&#x27; lives, a premise not dissimilar to the Violet-level campaign ideas presented in &quot;Extreme Paranoia&quot;.

The &quot;Troubleshooters&quot; volume retains the play styles of the &quot;XP &quot;rulebook; however, the &quot;Classic&quot; playstyle is assumed by default, with &quot;Zap&quot; and &quot;Straight&quot; relegated to an appendix. Allen Varney, designer of the &quot;XP &quot;edition, explained in a posting on RPG.net that this decision came about as a result of the XP edition successfully convincing the wider gaming public that &quot;Zap&quot; was not the default playstyle for the game; since it was now generally accepted that &quot;Paranoia &quot;could have a variety of playstyles and each GM would interpret it somewhat differently, it was considered no longer necessary to emphasise the different playstyles in the main text. The &quot;Internal Security&quot; volume includes an appendix listing three new styles tailored for the game - &quot;Heist&quot;, &quot;Overkill&quot; and &quot;Horror&quot;. &quot;High Programmers&quot; does not specify playstyles.

===Red Clearance Edition===
The Red Clearance edition from Mongoose Publishing was announced through Kickstarter 24 October 2014. In a departure from previous Mongoose editions, RED Clearance Edition utilises a d6-based dice pool system as well as using cards for equipment, mutant powers, secret societies, and combat actions. The base game was primarily designed by James Wallis with co-authors Grant Howitt and Paul Dean, and released in March 2017. Additional writing for the new edition was initially provided by Gareth Hanrahan, while the first major expansion, Acute PARANOIA, was written by various writers and funded through Kickstarter in 2018 for an early 2019 release.

=== The All New Shiny Edition ===
Originally known as &quot;Perfect Edition&quot;, this edition from Mongoose Publishing was launched as a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign on 22 October 2022, and released on 22 September 2023. This edition was written and designed by WJ MacGuffin and Keith Garrett. It uses a heavily revised version of the Red Clearance Edition rules, removing the card based system that was introduced in Red Clearance Edition, maintaining the d6-based dice pool system, and adding more lore and new features such as &quot;favours&quot;.

==Reception==
In the Jan-Feb 1985 edition of &quot;Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 72), the editorial staff were enthusiastic about the game, commenting &quot;If you&#x27;re likely to take it personally when your best friend&#x27;s character plugs &quot;your&quot; character from behind, &quot;stay away from this game&quot;. But if you like high-tension suspense along with a slightly bent sense of humor, &quot;Paranoia&quot; is a unique and highly desirable experience.&quot;

Marcus L. Rowland reviewed &quot;Paranoia&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #65, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that &quot;I like Paranoia, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;d want to run it as a prolonged campaign. It&#x27;s the sort of concept which works well as light relief from a &#x27;serious&#x27; RPG campaign, and will definitely appeal to &#x27;hack and slay&#x27; merchants. Dedicated rule lawyers and wargamers will hate it. Overall, a lot of fun for a minimum of three or four players.&quot;

In the April 1988 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 132), Jim Bambra thought that the second edition had marked improvements compared to the first edition: &quot;The first edition of &quot;Paranoia&quot; promised hilarious fun and a combat system that didn’t get bogged down in tedious mechanics. It soon found a following among gamers looking for something different in their role-playing adventures. Still, a close inspection of the combat system revealed that it was slow moving and cumbersome. The mechanics were hard to grasp in places, making it difficult to get into the freewheeling fun. Now, all that’s changed. The &quot;Paranoia&quot; game has been treated to a revamp, and this time the rules are slick. All that tricky stuff which made the combat system such a pain to run has been shelved off into optional rules. If you want the extra complications, you’re welcome to them, or you can do what most people did anyway and simply ignore them.&quot; Bambra did express reservations about the suitability of the game for an on-going campaign, saying &quot;It doesn&#x27;t lend itself easily to long-term campaign play. This game is best treated as a succession of short adventure sessions in which players get to enjoy themselves doing all those despicable things that would spoil a more &#x27;serious&#x27; game.&quot; However Bambra concluded with a recommendation, saying &quot;As a tongue-in-cheek science-fiction game, this one is hard to beat.&quot;

In &quot;The Games Machine&quot; #3, John Wood enjoyed the &quot;darkly humorous&quot; artwork of the second edition, and complimented the writers for a better-organized set of rules. He concluded, &quot;The new edition is far more suitable for those with little or no RPG experience, and is excellent value for a complete system (just add a 20-sided die).&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called this game &quot;a brilliant, revolutionary RPG ... that defies categorization and stands as one of the most thoroughly enjoyable games of the last ten years.&quot; After summarizing the lack of personal freedom under the control of the insane Computer, Swan allowed that &quot;It sound oppressive, but it&#x27;s all quite hilarious, thanks to the tongue-in-cheek approach permeating every aspect of the game.&quot; Swan noted the elaborate rules for character creation and combat resolution, &quot;but they&#x27;re essentially irrelevant, because the referee is encouraged to make up everything as he goes along.&quot; Swan did note that this puts a lot of pressure on the referee. Likewise, he warned that &quot;players used to the rigid structures and cooperative emphasis of traditional RPGs may have trouble with a game this chaotic.&quot; Nevertheless, Swan concluded by giving this game his top rating of 4 out of 4, saying, &quot;This is sophisticated, intelligent role-playing at its most subversive, a satiric masterpiece that should delight any experienced player with a taste for the bizarre.&quot;

In a 1996 reader poll conducted by &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, &quot;Paranoia&quot; was ranked 7th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;For players of games where character development and campaign continuity are a priority, &quot;Paranoia&quot; is an absolute no-no. If a character (of which there are six versions - each person in Alpha Complex has six clones) lives through an entire scenario then they&#x27;re doing well. Hell, they&#x27;re doing better than well, they&#x27;re probably Jesus Christ reborn (er, no offence intended, all ye Christian types). Suffice to say that &quot;Paranoia&quot; is, and always will be, a complete laugh - it should be played for nothing more than fun&quot;.

&quot;Paranoia&quot; was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Steve Jackson described the game as &quot;the first sophisticated parody of the basic tropes of roleplaying. Paranoia didn&#x27;t offer dungeons full of monsters with sillier names than those in &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. It introduced something scarier... the futuristic tunnels of Alpha Complex, in which all the monsters were human and nobody ever got out. &quot;Paranoia&quot; held all of roleplaying, as it was then practiced, to a dark and twisted mirror. Then it threw cream pies.&quot;

==Early development==
Daniel Seth Gelber designed his own role-playing game about a dystopic world controlled by a computer called &quot;Alpha Complex&quot; and ran adventures using this game for his local group. In this game which Gelber designed, the player characters were called &quot;Plaukers&quot; by the non-player characters, and these player characters often undercut and upstaged each other. Gelber was a friend of Greg Costikyan who approached Gelber with Eric Goldberg to get the setting published. Gelber gave Goldberg and Costikyan his notes for the game and they used those ideas to complete a full manuscript for a game. Gelber, Costikyan, and Goldberg licensed this &quot;Paranoia&quot; game to West End Games, and Ken Rolston helped rewrite the rules before it was published in 1984.

Gelber also designed (with Jeffrey Simons and Evan Jones) The &quot;Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game&quot;.

==Awards==
* &quot;Paranoia&quot; won the Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Rules of 1984. 
* The game was inducted into the Origins Awards Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Paranoia-related software==
&quot;JParanoia&quot; is freeware fan-made software specifically created for playing Paranoia over the Internet. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine and consists of a client and a server with built-in features for character and gameplay management. In September 2004, both attracted some mainstream attention when the UK edition of PC Gamer magazine ran an article about Paranoia as one of their &quot;Extra Life&quot; columns and showcased &quot;JParanoia&quot; and Paranoia Live; coincidentally the publicity came right before the site was poised to celebrate the launch of the new Paranoia edition from Mongoose.

Paranoia was also made into a video game called &quot;The Paranoia Complex&quot; released in 1989 by Magic Bytes. It was available for Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It took the form of a top-down maze shooter dressed in a Paranoia plot and trappings; reviews of the game from hobby magazines of the period pegged it as mediocre to poor.

A &quot;Paranoia&quot; mini-gamebook was published in issue #77 of SpaceGamer/FantasyGamer magazine in the late 1980s. Unauthorized automated versions of the story (a Troubleshooter&#x27;s assignment to undermine the subversive activity known as Christmas) have circulated via machine-independent ports to C, Python, Go and Inform as well as to Adventure Game Toolkit and for Applix, CP/M and the Cybiko.

&quot;Paranoia: Happiness is Mandatory&quot; is a video game that was released on 5 December 2019, for PC on the Epic Games Store. It was developed by Cyanide and Black Shamrock studios and is published by Bigben Interactive. It is an isometric view real-time RPG. In mid-January 2020, the game was removed from the Epic Games Store without explanation from Cyanide or BigBen Interactive. Court reports suggest a lawsuit by the creators of the property against the publishers is a factor. In December 2023, after the creators reached an agreement with BigBen/Nacon, the game returned to be publicly available at Epic Games Store once more as well as on Steam.

<doc id="181206" wikidata="Q309078" url="?curid=181206" title="Wide-body aircraft">
<text>A wide-body aircraft, also known as a twin-aisle aircraft and in the largest cases as a jumbo jet, is an airliner with a fuselage wide enough to accommodate two passenger aisles with seven or more seats abreast. The typical fuselage diameter is . In the typical wide-body economy cabin, passengers are seated seven to ten abreast, allowing a total capacity of 200 to 850 passengers. Seven-abreast aircraft typically seat 160 to 260 passengers, eight-abreast 250 to 380, nine- and ten-abreast 350 to 480. The largest wide-body aircraft are over wide, and can accommodate up to eleven passengers abreast in high-density configurations.

By comparison, a typical narrow-body aircraft has a diameter of , with a single aisle, and seats between two and six people abreast.

Wide-body aircraft were originally designed for a combination of efficiency and passenger comfort and to increase the amount of cargo space. However, airlines quickly gave in to economic factors, and reduced the extra passenger space in order to insert more seats and increase revenue and profits. Wide-body aircraft are also used by commercial cargo airlines, along with other specialized uses.

By the end of 2017, nearly 8,800 wide-body airplanes had been delivered since 1969, with production peaking at 412 in 2015.

== History ==
===1960s===

Following the success of the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 in the late 1950s and early 1960s, airlines began seeking larger aircraft to meet the rising global demand for air travel. Engineers were faced with many challenges as airlines demanded more passenger seats per aircraft, longer ranges and lower operating costs.

Early jet aircraft such as the 707 and DC-8 seated passengers along either side of a single aisle, with no more than six seats per row. Larger aircraft would have to be longer, higher (double-deck aircraft), or wider in order to accommodate a greater number of passenger seats.

Engineers realized having two decks created difficulties in meeting emergency evacuation regulations with the technology available at that time. During the 1960s, it was also believed that supersonic airliners would succeed larger, slower planes. Thus, it was believed that most subsonic aircraft would become obsolete for passenger travel and would be eventually converted to freighters. As a result, airline manufacturers opted for a wider fuselage rather than a taller one (the 747, and eventually the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Lockheed L-1011 TriStar). By adding a second aisle, the wider aircraft could accommodate as many as 10 seats across, but could also be easily converted to a freighter and carry two eight-by-eight freight pallets abreast.

The engineers also opted for creating &quot;stretched&quot; versions of the DC-8 (61, 62 and 63 models), as well as longer versions of Boeing&#x27;s 707 (-320B and 320C models) and 727 (-200 model); and Douglas&#x27; DC-9 (-30, -40, and -50 models), all of which were capable of accommodating more seats than their shorter predecessor versions.
===1970s===
The wide-body age of jet travel began in 1970 with the entry into service of the first wide-body airliner, the four-engined, partial double-deck Boeing 747. New trijet wide-body aircraft soon followed, including the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and the L-1011 TriStar. The first wide-body twinjet, the Airbus A300, entered service in 1974. This period came to be known as the &quot;wide-body wars&quot;.

L-1011 TriStars were demonstrated in the USSR in 1974, as Lockheed sought to sell the aircraft to Aeroflot. However, in 1976 the Soviet Union launched its own first four-engined wide-body, the Ilyushin Il-86.

After the success of the early wide-body aircraft, several subsequent designs came to market over the next two decades, including the Boeing 767 and 777, the Airbus A330 and Airbus A340, and the McDonnell Douglas MD-11. In the &quot;jumbo&quot; category, the capacity of the Boeing 747 was not surpassed until October 2007, when the Airbus A380 entered commercial service with the nickname &quot;Superjumbo&quot;. Both the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 &quot;jumbo jets&quot; have four engines each (quad-jets), but the upcoming Boeing 777X (&quot;mini jumbo jet&quot;) is a twinjet.

In the mid-2000s, rising oil costs in a post-9/11 climate caused airlines to look towards newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft. Two such examples are the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 XWB. The proposed Comac C929 and C939 may also share this new wide-body market.

The production of the large Boeing 747-8 and Airbus A380 four-engine, long-haul jets has come to an end as airlines are now preferring the smaller, more efficient Airbus A350, Boeing 787 and Boeing 777 twin-engine, long-range airliners.

== Design ==

=== Fuselage ===
Although wide-body aircraft have larger frontal areas (and thus greater form drag) than narrow-body aircraft of similar capacity, they have several advantages over their narrow-body counterparts, such as:

* Larger cabin space for passengers, giving a more open feeling.
* Lower ratio of surface area to volume, and thus lower drag per passenger or cargo volume. The only exception to this would be with very long narrow-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 757 and Airbus A321.
* Twin aisles that accelerate loading, unloading, and evacuation compared to a single aisle (wide-body airliners typically have 3.5 to 5 seats abreast per aisle, compared to 5–6 on most narrow-body aircraft).
* Reduced overall aircraft length for a given capacity, improving ground manoeuvrability and reducing the risk of tail strikes.
* Greater under-floor freight capacity.
* Better structural efficiency for larger aircraft than would be possible with a narrow-body design.

British and Russian designers had proposed wide-body aircraft similar in configuration to the Vickers VC10 and Douglas DC-9, but with a wide-body fuselage. The British BAC Three-Eleven project did not proceed due to lack of government backing, while the Russian Ilyushin Il-86 wide-body proposal eventually gave way to a more conventional wing-mounted engine design, most likely due to the inefficiencies of mounting such large engines on the aft fuselage.

=== Engines ===
As jet engine power and reliability have increased over the last decades, most of the wide-body aircraft built today have only two engines. A twinjet design is more fuel-efficient than a trijet or quadjet of similar size. The increased reliability of modern jet engines also allows aircraft to meet the ETOPS certification standard, which calculates reasonable safety margins for flights across oceans. The trijet design was dismissed due to higher maintenance and fuel costs compared to a twinjet. Most modern wide-body aircraft have two engines, although the heaviest wide-body aircraft, the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747-8, are built with four engines. The upcoming Boeing 777X-9 twinjet is approaching the capacity of the earlier Boeing 747.

The Boeing 777 twinjet features the most powerful jet engine, the General Electric GE90. The early variants have a fan diameter of , and the larger GE90-115B has a fan diameter of . This is almost as wide as the Fokker 100 fuselage. Complete GE90 engines can only be ferried by outsize cargo aircraft such as the Antonov An-124, presenting logistics problems if a 777 is stranded in a place due to emergency diversions without the proper spare parts. If the fan is removed from the core, then the engines may be shipped on a Boeing 747 Freighter.
The General Electric GE9X, powering the Boeing 777X, is wider than the GE90 by .

The maximum takeoff weight of the Airbus A380 would not have been possible without the engine technology developed for the Boeing 777 such as contra-rotating spools. Its Trent 900 engine has a fan diameter of , slightly smaller than the GE90 engines on the Boeing 777. The Trent 900 is designed to fit into a Boeing 747-400F freighter for easier transport by air cargo.

=== Interior ===

The interiors of aircraft, known as the aircraft cabin, have been undergoing evolution since the first passenger aircraft. Today, between one and four classes of travel are available on wide-body aircraft.

Bar and lounge areas which were once installed on wide-body aircraft have mostly disappeared, but a few have returned in first class or business class on the Airbus A340-600, Boeing 777-300ER, and on the Airbus A380. Emirates has installed showers for first-class passengers on the A380; twenty-five minutes are allotted for use of the room, and the shower operates for a maximum of five minutes.

Depending on how the airline configures the aircraft, the size and seat pitch of the airline seats will vary significantly. For example, aircraft scheduled for shorter flights are often configured at a higher seat density than long-haul aircraft. Due to current economic pressures on the airline industry, high seating densities in the economy class cabin are likely to continue.

In some of the largest single-deck wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 777, the extra space above the cabin is used for crew rest areas and galley storage.


== Jumbo jets ==

The term &quot;jumbo jet&quot; usually refers to the largest variants of wide-body airliners; examples include the Boeing 747 (the first wide-body and original &quot;jumbo jet&quot;), Airbus A380 (&quot;superjumbo jet&quot;), and Boeing 777-9. The phrase &quot;jumbo jet&quot; derives from Jumbo, a circus elephant in the 19th century.

== Wake turbulence and separation ==

Aircraft are categorized by ICAO according to the wake turbulence they produce. Because wake turbulence is generally related to the weight of an aircraft, these categories are based on one of four weight categories: light, medium, heavy, and super.

Due to their weight, all current wide-body aircraft are categorized as &quot;heavy&quot;, or in the case of the A380 in U.S. airspace, &quot;super&quot;.

The wake-turbulence category also is used to guide the separation of aircraft. Super- and heavy-category aircraft require greater separation behind them than those in other categories. In some countries, such as the United States, it is a requirement to suffix the aircraft&#x27;s call sign with the word &quot;heavy&quot; (or &quot;super&quot;) when communicating with air traffic control in certain areas.

== Special uses ==
Wide-body aircraft are used in science, research, and the military. Some wide-body aircraft are used as flying command posts by the military like the Ilyushin Il-80 or the Boeing E-4, while the Boeing E-767 is used for airborne early warning and control. New military weapons are tested aboard wide-bodies, as in the laser weapons testing on the Boeing YAL-1. Other wide-body aircraft are used as flying research stations, such as the joint German–U.S. Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). Airbus A340, Airbus A380, and Boeing 747 four-engine wide-body aircraft are used to test new generations of aircraft engines in flight. A few aircraft have also been converted for aerial firefighting, such as the DC-10-based Tanker 910 and the 747-200-based Evergreen Supertanker.

Some wide-body aircraft are used as VIP transport. To transport those holding the highest offices, Canada uses the Airbus A310, while Russia uses the Ilyushin Il-96. Germany replaced its Airbus A310 with an Airbus A340 in spring 2011. Specially-modified Boeing 747-200s (Boeing VC-25s) are used to transport the President of the United States.

=== Outsize cargo ===

Some wide-body aircraft have been modified to enable transport of oversize cargo. Examples include the Airbus Beluga, Airbus BelugaXL and Boeing Dreamlifter. Two specially modified Boeing 747s were used to transport the U.S. Space Shuttle, while the Antonov An-225 was initially built to carry the Buran shuttle.

<doc id="181210" wikidata="Q76967" url="?curid=181210" title="Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha">
<text>Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg ( – 8 February 1772) was Princess of Wales by marriage to Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son and heir apparent of King George II. She never became queen consort, as Frederick predeceased his father in 1751. Augusta&#x27;s eldest son succeeded her father-in-law as George III in 1760. After her spouse died, Augusta was the presumptive regent of Great Britain in the event of a regency, until her son reached majority in 1756.

==Early life==
Princess Augusta was born in Gotha to Frederick II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (1676–1732) and Magdalena Augusta of Anhalt-Zerbst (1679–1740). Her paternal grandfather was Frederick I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, eldest surviving son of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.

In 1736, it was proposed that she marry 29-year-old Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II of Great Britain and his queen consort Caroline of Ansbach. Originally, Frederick was intended to marry the eldest daughter of the King of Prussia. A marriage alliance between Great Britain and Prussia had been an ambition for many years. However, when George II suggested that his eldest son would marry the eldest (unmarried) daughter of the King of Prussia, while his second (unmarried) daughter would marry the eldest son of the Prussian king, the King of Prussia demanded that his eldest son should likewise marry the eldest (unmarried) daughter of the King of Great Britain, and George II refused to agree to this demand.

Around the time the Prussian plan was cancelled, there were rumours that Frederick might marry Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford, granddaughter of the Duchess of Marlborough, and that such a marriage had been proposed when he visited the duchess&#x27;s lodge at Richmond. Queen Caroline felt a need to arrange a marriage for her son quickly, to preempt any possibility of such a mésalliance. She therefore suggested to the king that, when he next visited the Electorate of Hanover, he should also visit Saxe-Gotha and view the princesses there. The king did so, and informed the queen that he considered Augusta suitable. When the matter was broached with Frederick, he simply replied that he would accept any bride his father decided was suitable for him. His attitude arose from a desire to obtain an additional allowance from Parliament to be financially independent of his father.

Augusta did not speak French or English, and it was suggested that she be given lessons before the wedding, but her mother did not consider it necessary, as the British royal family were from Germany. She arrived in Britain, speaking virtually no English, aged 16, for a wedding ceremony which took place almost immediately, on , at the Chapel Royal in St James&#x27;s Palace, London.

==Princess of Wales==
Augusta of Saxe-Gotha left Hellevoetsluis 17 April 1736 and arrived at Greenwich on the royal yacht &quot;William and Mary&quot; on the 25th, where she was welcomed by her groom. On 27 April 1736, she was escorted to St James&#x27;s Palace, London, where she met the rest of the royal family. When she was introduced to the royal family, she made a favourable impression on the king and queen by throwing herself on the floor before them in a gesture of respect. The wedding ceremony was held at the Royal Chapel inside St. James&#x27;s Palace the same day (27 April O.S., 8 May N.S.)

During the first year of marriage, Augusta could be seen playing with her doll in the windows of her residence, until her sister-in-law, Princess Caroline, told her to stop. Frederick took advantage of her inexperience when he had his then lover, Lady Archibald Hamilton, employed as her First Lady of the Bedchamber, after convincing Augusta that there was no truth in the rumour of his affair. Augusta and Frederick had nine children, the last born after Frederick&#x27;s death.

Frederick once stated that he would never allow himself to be influenced by his consort as his father was, and he thus never made Augusta his confidante. He did, however, instruct her to act in accordance with his wishes in his feud with his parents, and on several occasions, Frederick reportedly instructed her to snub them.
When she attended the service of the German Lutheran Chapel, for example, which was also attended by the queen, Frederick instructed Augusta to make sure she always arrived after the queen, so that she would be forced to push in front of the queen to reach her place. This eventually made the queen insist that Augusta should be directed to her place by another entrance, which in turn caused Frederick to instruct Augusta to refuse to enter the Chapel if the queen had arrived before her.

When Augusta&#x27;s first pregnancy was announced, the queen stated that she would be sure to witness the birth, to be assured that the pregnancy was indeed genuine. She reportedly wished the succession to pass to her second surviving son, Prince William, Duke of Cumberland. The birth of their first daughter, Princess Augusta, on 31 July 1737, took place at St James&#x27;s after the Princess of Wales was forced by Frederick to travel from Hampton Court Palace while in labour, to prevent his hated parents from being present at the birth. The delivery was traumatic: St James Palace was not ready to receive them, no bed was prepared, no sheets could be found, and Augusta was forced to give birth on a tablecloth.
Queen Caroline once said of her daughter-in-law and the inconveniences she had inflicted on her: &quot;Poor creature, were she to spit in my face, I should only pity her for being under such a fool&#x27;s direction, and wipe it off.&quot;

The circumstances of the birth of Princess Augusta led to a dispute between the Prince and Princess of Wales and the king and queen, who were not reconciled until public opinion during the Jacobite rebellion in 1745 pressured them to. After the reconciliation, the couple became less isolated from high society, allowing courtiers to appear at both courts without giving offence. Augusta made a good impression in society life, where she was described as pretty, elegant, and a gracious hostess. On some occasions, the children of Augusta were made to give amateur theatre performances for their guests, notably on 4 January 1749, when George, Augusta, Elizabeth, Edward and some of their playmates acted in the tragedy of &quot;Cato&quot;.

==Princess dowager==

On 31 March 1751, Frederick unexpectedly died, making Augusta a widow at thirty-two. Dr. Doran described her at the death of her spouse: &quot;She had, throughout her married life exhibited much mental superiority, with great kindness of disposition, and that under circumstances of great difficulty, and sometimes of a character to inflict vexation on the calmest nature. [...] She was then the mother of eight children, expecting shortly to be the mother of a ninth, and she was brought reluctantly to knowledge that their father was no more. It was six in the morning before her attendants could persuade her to retire to bed; but she arose again at eight, and then, with less thought for her grief than anxiety for the honour of him whose death was the cause of it, she proceeded to the Prince&#x27;s room, and burned the whole of his private papers. By this the world lost some rare supplementary chapters to a Chronique Scandaleuse!&quot;
The King reportedly did not show much feeling upon the death of his son and the funeral was simple. On receiving the King&#x27;s condolences, Augusta replied that she placed herself and her children upon his mercy and protection, and he was evidently touched by her widowhood and minor children, and was willing to show them consideration. Following Frederick&#x27;s death, her role as mother of the heir-apparent to the throne became a more prominent one, and she was named prospective regent by the king and the parliament, should the King die during the minority of her eldest son, the Prince of Wales. This caused a controversy and opposition from Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, who had expected to be given that role instead.

During the remaining years of the reign of George II, Augusta chose to live in seclusion with her children, devoting herself to their care. The few occasions when she did appear in public, the King gave her the same ceremonial role and honours previously given to the Queen, and she was honoured the same way by the public as well as the court.

However, Augusta suffered a loss of popularity as a widow. She was to be criticised for her manner of raising her children, as she isolated them from the outside world into a secluded family environment, seldom meeting people outside the family.

As her eldest son came of age, the King attempted to arrange a marriage. His favoured choice was a princess of Brunswick-Wolffenbüttel or a princess of Prussia, but Augusta refused, favouring a member of her own family, the House of Saxe-Gotha.

On 25 October 1760, her son succeeded his grandfather as George III. The year after his succession, he married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Augusta&#x27;s relationship with her daughter-in-law was not a good one. She reportedly made it difficult for Charlotte to establish social contacts by referring to rigid court etiquette. Furthermore, she initially appointed a large part of Charlotte&#x27;s court staff, several of whom were suspected of reporting to Augusta about Charlotte&#x27;s behaviour. When Charlotte turned to her German companions for friends, she was criticised by Augusta for keeping favourites, notably her close confidant Juliane von Schwellenberg.

Augusta had an acknowledged political influence upon her son, who &quot;strove to follow the counsels she gave&quot;, and in which he trusted. Reportedly, she was in turn influenced by Lord Bute, who was appointed prime minister with her support in 1762. His appointment caused a serious crisis and exposed both Augusta and Bute to such public hostility that Bute had to resign from his post the following year. Thackeray described the public sentiments and the circulating rumours: &quot;Bute was hated with a rage there have been few examples in English history. He was the butt for everybody&#x27;s abuse; for Wilkes, for Churchill&#x27;s slashing satire, for the hooting of the mob who roasted his booth, his emblem, in a thousand bonfires; that hated him because he was a favourite and a Scotsman, calling him Mortimer, Lothario, and I know not what names, and accusing his royal mistress of all kinds of names – the grave, lean, demure, elderly woman, who, I dare say, was quite as good as her neighbours. Chatham lent the aide of his great malice to influence the popular sentiment against her. He assailed, in the House of Lords, &#x27;The secret influence, more mighty than the throne itself, which betrayed and dogged every administration&#x27;. The most furious pamphlets echoed the cry &#x27;Impeach the King&#x27;s mother&#x27;, was scribbled over every wall at the Court end of the town&quot;.
When the King had a first, temporary, bout of mental illness in 1765, Augusta and Lord Bute kept Queen Charlotte unaware of the situation. The Regency Bill of 1765 stated that if the King should become permanently unable to rule, Charlotte was to become Regent. Augusta was suggested as regent, but there was fierce opposition to her appointment, as there were concerns of the influence of Lord Bute in her potential regency, and fears that should she become regent, Bute would de facto rule as &quot;King&quot;.

Augusta reportedly resented the marriages of her younger sons, which took place without her consent.

In 1769, the husband of her daughter Caroline Matilda, Christian VII of Denmark, visited Great Britain. During his visit, Augusta, upon the initiative of Caroline Matilda, asked him publicly during a dinner to reinstate Louise von Plessen, a favourite of Caroline Matilda whom Christian had fired, to her position. He answered that he had made a sacred vow never to do so, but that if Caroline Matilda preferred von Plessen&#x27;s company over his, so be it. In the end, Louise von Plessen was not reinstated, and Augusta apparently asked Caroline Matilda not to press the matter and to show more affection to Christian.

In 1770, rumours about Caroline Matilda, the queen of Denmark, began to circulate. In particular these concerned the mental state of her spouse as well as the fall of prime minister Count Johann Hartwig Ernst von Bernstorff, in which Caroline Matilda was rumoured to have participated. When Augusta visited her eldest daughter in Brunswick that year, she also took the opportunity to see Caroline Matilda, who received her in breeches, which at that time was regarded as scandalous. Upon Augusta&#x27;s lamentations, her daughter answered: &quot;Pray, madam, allow me to govern my own kingdom as I please!&quot;

Augusta died of throat cancer at the age of 52 at Carlton House, and was buried seven days later at Westminster Abbey.

==Kew Gardens==
Princess Augusta enlarged and greatly extended Kew Gardens after her husband&#x27;s death. Sir William Chambers built several garden structures for her. One of these, the lofty Great Pagoda built in 1761, still remains.

<doc id="181211" wikidata="Q433098" url="?curid=181211" title="Charlotte Mary Yonge">
<text>Charlotte Mary Yonge (11 August 1823 – 24 March 1901) was an English novelist, who wrote in the service of the church. Her abundant books helped to spread the influence of the Oxford Movement and showed her keen interest in matters of public health and sanitation.

==Life==
Charlotte Mary Yonge was born in Otterbourne, Hampshire, England, on 11 August 1823 to William Yonge and Fanny Yonge, &quot;née&quot; Bargus. She was educated at home by her father, studying Latin, Greek, French, Euclid, and algebra. Her father&#x27;s lessons could be harsh:
Yonge&#x27;s devotion to her father was lifelong and her relations with him seem to have set the standard for all other relations, including marriage. His &quot;approbation was throughout life my bliss; his anger my misery for the time.&quot;

Yonge was born into a religious family. Devoted to the High church, she was much influenced by John Keble, Vicar of Hursley from 1835, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Yonge was herself sometimes referred to as &quot;the novelist of the Oxford Movement&quot;, as her work frequently reflects values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She remained in Otterbourne all her life and taught for 71 years in the village Sunday school. Her house, &#x27;Elderfield&#x27;, became a Grade II listed building in 1984.
In 1858 she paid for the construction of a combined school and chapel of ease to Hursley parish church in the village of Pitt. It was designed by William Butterfield and, like Elderfield, has been a Grade II listed building since 1984. In 1868 a new parish was formed to the south of Yonge&#x27;s home village of Otterbourne. This was to contain the villages of Eastley and Barton. Yonge donated £500 towards the Church of the Resurrection, the Church of England parish church, and was asked to choose which of the two villages the parish should be named after. She chose Eastley but decided that it should be spelt &quot;Eastleigh&quot; as she perceived this as being more modern.

Yonge died in her home village of Otterbourne on 24 March 1901. Her obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; stated,
==Literary career==
Yonge began writing in 1848 and published in her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, &quot;The Heir of Redclyffe&quot; (1853), provided the funding to put the schooner &quot;Southern Cross&quot; into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for 40 years of &quot;The Monthly Packet&quot;, a magazine founded in 1851, with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls, though in later years it turned to a somewhat wider readership).
Among her other well-known works are &quot;Heartsease&quot;, and &quot;The Daisy Chain&quot;. &quot;A Book of Golden Deeds&quot; is a collection of true stories of courage and self-sacrifice. Other titles were &quot;Cameos from English History&quot;, &quot;Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands&quot;, and &quot;Hannah More&quot;. Her &quot;History of Christian Names&quot; was described as &quot;the first serious attempt at tackling the subject&quot; and as the standard work on names in the preface to the first edition of Betty Withycombe&#x27;s &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names&quot; (1944).

Around 1859 Yonge created a literary group of younger girl cousins, to write essays and gain advice from Yonge on their writing. Together they created a private magazine, &quot;The Barnacle&quot;, which continued until about 1871. This was valuable as they may have belonged to the last generation of girls educated at home. Her goddaughter, Alice Mary Coleridge, contributed as &quot;Gurgoyle&quot; to the first issue, drawing the covers and contributing translations, articles and verses.

Yonge&#x27;s personal example and influence on her goddaughter Alice Mary Coleridge were formative in her zeal for women&#x27;s education, leading indirectly to the foundation of Abbots Bromley School for Girls.

After Yonge&#x27;s death, her friend, assistant and collaborator, Christabel Coleridge, published the biographical &quot;Charlotte Mary Yonge: her Life and Letters&quot; (1903).

==Reputation==
Yonge&#x27;s work was widely read and respected in the 19th century. Among her admirers were Lewis Carroll, George Eliot, William Ewart Gladstone, Charles Kingsley, Christina Rossetti, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Anthony Trollope. William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones read &quot;The Heir of Redclyffe&quot; aloud to each other while undergraduates at Oxford University and &quot;took [the hero, Guy Morville&#x27;s] medieval tastes and chivalric ideals as presiding elements in the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.&quot; Yonge&#x27;s work was compared favourably with that of Trollope, Jane Austen, Honoré de Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, and Émile Zola.

Sir John Arthur Ransome Marriott called her:
So popular were her works that
C. S. Lewis thought highly of her, at one point bracketing her evocations of domestic life with those of Homer and Leo Tolstoy. Abraham Kuyper, who read &quot;The Heir of Redclyffe&quot; on the recommendation of his fiancé, Johanna Schaay, found it a moving experience. The novel was &quot;next to the Bible in its meaning for my life.&quot; Yonge was one of the favourite writers of Barbara Pym, who mentions Yonge&#x27;s novels favourably in several of her own novels.

However, according to the critic Catherine Sandbach-Dahlström, Yonge&#x27;s work has been &quot;constantly be-devilled&quot; by a &quot;tendency to confuse the moral quality of [her] view of life with the quality of her literary expression&quot;.

Her novels such as &quot;The Daisy Chain&quot;, &quot;The Young Stepmother&quot;, &quot;The Trial&quot;, and &quot;The Three Brides&quot; encompass Victorian problems of urban pollution, sanitary reform, and epidemics of cholera and typhoid. She urged social, economic and medical reform of dirt-ridden Victorian cities. The dualism found in her writings, writes Alethea Hayter, &quot;serves to illustrate the triumphs and mistakes of reforming zeal, to contrast selfish irresponsibility with courageous philanthropy, to balance tradition against progress.&quot;

Yonge&#x27;s work has been sparely studied, with the possible exception of &quot;The Heir of Redclyffe&quot;.

Graham Greene used epigraphs from &quot;The Little Duke&quot; for each chapter of his 1943 novel &quot;The Ministry of Fear&quot;. In Chapter 1, the protagonist Arthur Rowe buys a copy of the book at a fête for sixpence.

In 2015 a sculpture by Vivien Mallock was installed outside Eastleigh railway station, as a tribute to Yonge for having effectively named the town. It shows her at the age of about 45 when she named Eastleigh parish. It shows her sitting on a bench with a book on her lap, with space for members of the public to sit alongside her.

<text>Johannes Gerhard (17 October 1582 – 17 August 1637) was a Lutheran church leader and Lutheran Scholastic theologian during the period of Orthodoxy.

==Biography==
He was born in the German city of Quedlinburg. During a dangerous illness, at the age of fourteen he came under the personal influence of Johann Arndt, author of &quot;Das wahre Christenthum&quot;, and resolved to study for the church. He entered the University of Wittenberg in 1599, and studied philosophy and theology. A relative then persuaded him to change his subject, and he studied medicine for two years. In 1603, he resumed his theological reading at Jena, and in the following year received a new impulse from J.W. Winckelmann and Balthasar Mentzer at Marburg. He graduated in 1605 and began to give lectures at Jena, then in 1606 he accepted the invitation of John Casimir, Duke of Coburg, to the superintendency of Heldburg and mastership of the gymnasium Casimirianum Coburg; soon afterwards he became general superintendent of the duchy, in which capacity he was engaged in the practical work of ecclesiastical organization until 1616, when he became the senior theological professor at Jena, where the remainder of his life was spent.

Here, with Johann Major and Johann Himmel, he formed the &quot;Trias Johannea.&quot; Though still comparatively young, Gerhard was already regarded as the greatest living theologian of Protestant Germany; in the &quot;disputations&quot; of the period he was always protagonist, and his advice was sought on all public and domestic questions touching on religion or morals. During his lifetime he received repeated calls to almost every university in Germany (e.g. Giessen, Altdorf, Helmstedt, Jena, Wittenberg), as well as to Uppsala in Sweden. He died in Jena.

==Writings==
His writings are numerous, alike in exegetical, polemical, dogmatic and practical theology. To the first category belong the (1617), the &quot;Comment, super priorem D. Petri epistolam&quot; (1641), and also his commentaries on &quot;Genesis&quot; (1637) and on &quot;Deuteronomy&quot; (1658). Of a controversial character are the &quot;Confessio Catholica&quot; (1633–1637), an extensive work which seeks to prove the &quot;evangelical&quot; and catholic character of the doctrine of the Augsburg Confession from the writings of approved Roman Catholic authors; and the &quot;Loci communes theologici&quot; (1610–1622), his principal contribution, in which Lutheranism is expounded &quot;&quot;nervose, solide et copiose&quot;,&quot; in fact with a fulness of learning, a force of logic and a minuteness of detail that had never before been approached.

The &quot;Meditationes sacrae&quot; (1606), a work expressly devoted to the uses of Christian edification, has been frequently reprinted in Latin and has been translated into most of the European languages, including Greek.

<text>This is a list of islands of [[Sweden]]. A 2013 statistics report concluded that there are 267,570 islands in Sweden, though less than 1,000 of these are inhabited. The total area of the islands is 1.2 million hectares, which corresponds to 3% percent of the total land area of Sweden. Most of the islands are in the Baltic Sea regions of the Bay of Bothnia and the Bothnian Sea.

Rough population statistics are from 2015.

<text>Johann Arndt (or Arnd; 27 December 155511 May 1621) was a German Lutheran theologian and mystic who wrote several influential books of devotional Christianity. Although reflective of the period of Lutheran Orthodoxy, he is seen as a forerunner of Pietism, a movement within Lutheranism that gained strength in the late 17th century.

==Biography==
He was born in Edderitz near Ballenstedt, in Anhalt-Köthen, and studied in several universities.
He was at Helmstedt in 1576 and at Wittenberg in 1577. At Wittenberg the crypto-Calvinist controversy was then at its height, and he took the side of Melanchthon and the crypto-Calvinists. He continued his studies in Strasbourg, under the professor of Hebrew, Johannes Pappus (1549–1610), a zealous Lutheran, the crown of whose life&#x27;s work was the forcible suppression of Calvinistic preaching and worship in the day, and who had great influence over him.

In Basel, again, he studied theology under Simon Sulzer (1508–1585), a broad-minded divine of Lutheran sympathies, whose aim was to reconcile the churches of the Helvetic and Wittenberg confessions. In 1581 he went back to Ballenstedt, but was soon recalled to active life by his appointment to the pastorate at Badeborn in 1583.
After some time his Lutheran tendencies aroused the anger of the authorities, who were of the Reformed Church.
Consequently, in 1590 he was deposed for refusing to remove the pictures from his church and discontinue the use of exorcism at baptism. He found an asylum in Quedlinburg (1590). However, he was very unpopular with the townspeople, and for that reason was transferred to St Martin&#x27;s church at Brunswick in 1599. He later worked in Eisleben, and from 1611 until his death in 1621 he was general superintendent in Celle. Among his last words were &quot;Now I have overcome all.&quot;

Arndt&#x27;s fame rests on his writings. These were mainly of a mystical and devotional kind, and were inspired by St Bernard, Johannes Tauler and Thomas à Kempis. His principal work, &quot;Wahres Christentum&quot; (book 1: 1605; books 1-4: 1606–1610) i.e. &quot;True Christianity&quot;, which has been translated into most European languages, has served as the foundation of many books of devotion, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. Arndt here dwells upon the mystical union between the believer and Christ, and endeavours, by drawing attention to Christ&#x27;s life &quot;in&quot; His people, to correct the purely forensic side of the reformation theology, which paid almost exclusive attention to Christ&#x27;s death &quot;for&quot; His people.

Like Luther, Arndt was very fond of the little anonymous book, &quot;Theologia Germanica&quot;. He published an edition of it and called attention to its merits in a special preface. After &quot;Wahres Christentum&quot;, Arndt&#x27;s best-known work is &quot;Paradiesgärtlein aller christlichen Tugenden&quot;, which was published in 1612. Both these books have been translated into English: &quot;Paradiesgärtlein&quot; with the title &quot;the Garden of Paradise&quot;, and &quot;Wahres Christentum&quot; as &quot;True Christianity&quot;. Several of his sermons are published in R. Nesselmann&#x27;s &quot;Buch der Predigten&quot; (1858). A collected edition of his works was published in Leipzig and Görlitz in 1734.

Arndt was held in very high repute by the German Pietists. The founder of Pietism, Philipp Jakob Spener, repeatedly called attention to him and his writings, and even went so far as to compare him with Plato. So important was Arndt&#x27;s influence on the early Pietists that some scholars have even called him the true founder of the movement.

His impact in Sweden includes Jesper Swedberg and Peter Lorenz Sellergren.

<text>Sigmund Werner Paul Jähn (; 13 February 1937 – 21 September 2019) was a German pilot, cosmonaut, and &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (equivalent to a Brigadier General in Western armies) in the National People&#x27;s Army of the GDR. He was the first German to fly into space as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Interkosmos program in 1978.

He was the very last living East German holder of the title Hero of the German Democratic Republic when he died in 2019.

==Early life==

Jähn was born on 13 February 1937, in the town of Morgenröthe-Rautenkranz, located within the Vogtland region of Saxony, Nazi Germany. His father, Paul Jähn, was a sawmill worker, and his mother, Dora Jähn, was a housewife. Sigmund attended primary school from 1943 to 1951 and then trained in an apprenticeship program as a book printer from 1951 to 1954. Shortly after the apprenticeship, he worked as a Pioneer Leader at the Hammerbrücke Central School. Jähn (via his father&#x27;s stories and memorabilia) and his father were impressed by the early rocketry pioneers of the 1920s around Fritz von Opel and the first manned rockets on land and in the air, igniting his enthusiasm for aviation, rocketry and spaceflight.

On April 26, 1955, Jähn enlisted into the predecessor of the East German Army in the town of Preschen and eventually worked his way into the East German Air Force. He finished basic training in 1956, enrolling into the Officer&#x27;s School in Kamenz, and was sent to flight school in the town of Bautzen, which would later become its own Officer&#x27;s School for military pilots. Jähn returned to his squadron, the &quot;Jagdfliegergeschwader 8&quot;, or &quot;Fighter Aviation Squad 8&quot;, two years later and remained there until 1960, when he and his team were relocated one last time to Marxwalde. During his flight career, he saved himself from crashing by ejecting from the MiG-17 he was piloting. He worked as the Deputy Commander for Political Affairs in his squadron from 1961 to 1963, then headed the Air Tactics/Air Combat division until 1965. At the same time, Jähn passed his &quot;Abitur&quot; and was sent to the J.A. Gagarin Air Force Academy in Monino, just outside of Moscow, Russia. Between 1970 and 1976, he was an inspector for fighter-pilot training and flight safety under the &quot;Deputy Head of the LSK/LV for Air Force Training&quot; of the Kommando LSK/LV.

Jähn achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and was selected for the Soviet Union&#x27;s Interkosmos cosmonaut training program in November 1976, alongside three other candidates (Eberhard Köllner, Rolf Berger, and Eberhard Golbs). Jähn and Köllner were selected out of the three candidates to be included in the first Interkosmos group. In addition to Jähn&#x27;s previous flying experience and expertise with the Russian language, he was selected for his early entry into the SED program and his success coming from a blue-collar background.

== Space career ==

=== Training ===

Jähn and Köllner began training together in 1976, with Köllner serving as his backup pilot. The two candidates spent the next two years conducting mission-specific training and their physical health was closely monitored by physicians at the NVA&#x27;s Institute for Aviation Medicine in preparation for their upcoming flight.

=== Soyuz 31 mission ===

On August 26, 1978, Jähn and his co-pilot, Valery Bykovsky flew aboard the Soyuz 31 to the Soviet space station Salyut 6. The two men were greeted by resident cosmonauts Vladimir Kovalyonok and Aleksandr Ivanchenkov who arrived during the Soyuz 29 mission. Jähn&#x27;s flight lasted 7 days, 20 hours, 49 minutes, and 4 seconds - orbiting Earth 124 times. During the mission, he conducted numerous scientific experiments. These included technical experiments with the MKF-6 multispectral camera for remote sensing of the Earth&#x27;s surface, material science experiments on crystallization, like the formation, recrystallization, and the cultivation of a monocrystal. He also conducted medical experiments on how weightlessness affects speech, occupational psychological studies, testing the hearing sensitivity of regular crew members, biological experiments on cellular growth under weightlessness, and the connection between microorganisms with organic polymers and inorganic substances.

Among the advanced scientific equipment on board, the two cosmonauts carried mementos from home. Jähn brought a figurine of &quot;Das Sandmännchen&quot;, a well-known East German television character at the time, and Bykovsky brought a Misha doll, a character from a Soviet-era children&#x27;s book series. They even broadcast a wedding between the two characters, which became controversial among East German and Soviet media outlets.

The Soyuz 31 remained docked to the Salyut 6 station until the custom-made seats were transferred between both Soyuz craft, where it was then used as a return vessel for Kovalyonok and Ivanchenkov. Jähn and Bykovsky later returned in the Soyuz 29 craft.

Jähn received permanent injuries to his spinal cord after an unexpectedly rough landing. Just a few yards from the ground, a gust of wind thrust the capsule back into the air, causing it hit the ground with increased momentum. Jähn couldn&#x27;t reach the capsule&#x27;s parachute-release switch in time and was consequently dragged across the steppes where it landed, rolling over itself several times before coming to a stop. 

=== Media reception ===

The report on the space flight was prepared like a general staffing brief: on the morning of August 26, 1978, the editors in chief of the GDR radio stations and newspapers all received three sealed and numbered letters. Each one contained a different announcement depending on the outcome of the flight, whether it was successful, resulted in a fatal accident, or an emergency landing in enemy territory. The corresponding letter was only to be opened and published following a telephone call with specific instructions. After the mission was a success, the letters with the negative outcomes were then collected from the organizations.

Jähn&#x27;s space flight was celebrated and covered extensively by GDR media outlets, since one of the smaller German states was home to the first German in space. On Sunday, August 27, 1978, &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; published a special edition newspaper with the headline &quot;The First German in Space - A Citizen of the GDR&quot;. Specifically using the word &quot;German&quot; in reference to a citizen of Germany was not usually used in the GDR media. The Aktuelle Kamera also published numerous special programs about the mission.

Jähn was awarded the Hero of the GDR and the Hero of the Soviet Union medals in April, 1981, and a bust of the cosmonaut was unveiled in the &quot;Hain der Kosmonauten&quot; (trans. Hall of Cosmonauts) in front of the Archenhold Observatory in East Berlin. It was removed in 1990, though was later replaced with a new version in the Saxony State Statistical Office on February 22, 2008. Some schools, recreational centers, street names, and the cargo ship Neptun 421 were named in honor of Jähn throughout his lifetime. The observatory in Rodewisch, Germany, where Sputnik 1 was first observed from Earth, was also renamed after Jähn in 1979.

An exhibition dedicated to space flight and aeronautics was constructed in the former train station of his home town Morgenröthe-Rautenkranz. This exhibit received multiple additions between 1991 and 1992, and the name was formally changed to &quot;The German Space Exhibition&quot;. Since 2007, the expanded sections have been housed in a newer building not far from the original location. Furthermore, a 4.5m (~14.8 ft.) memorial was erected in the same town to commemorate the first German cosmonaut in space.

In the 2003 German film &quot;Good Bye, Lenin!&quot;, Jähn is the boyhood hero of the film&#x27;s protagonist, Alex Kerner. As part of an effort to prevent his mother from learning that the Berlin Wall came down while she was in a coma and that East Germany no longer exists as a separate nation, Kerner locates a taxi driver (played by Swiss actor Stefan Walz), who resembles the cosmonaut, to appear in a fake newscast as the successor of Communist Party Secretary Erich Honecker. &quot;Comrade Jähn&quot; gives a speech proclaiming that he will open the East German borders to welcome West German refugees.

The German public broadcaster Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk organized a themed event for his 80th birthday. It aired as part of a special television program &quot;Sigmund Jähn and the Heroes of the Stars&quot; on the nights of February 12 and 13, 2017.

In an interview with Der Spiegel 30 years after his space flight, Jähn commented: &quot;But the celebratory reports weren&#x27;t music to my ears; I didn&#x27;t want to be made into a folk hero. (. . .) I found the spotlight more strenuous than traveling in space.&quot;

Die Zeit stated in 2018: &quot;To this day, many West Germans do not know the first German in space. (. . .) Conversely, all former GDR citizens know who Sigmund Jähn is.&quot;

== Later career ==

Jähn was promoted to colonel in 1978 following the success of the Soyuz 31 space flight and was subsequently promoted to Deputy Head of the Center for Cosmic Training within the Kommando LSK/LV. He remained deputy head of the training center until 1990.

In 1983, Jähn received his doctorate of science in remote sensing of the Earth at the Zentralinstitut für Physik der Erde in Potsdam. He studied under the leadership of Karl-Heinz Marek, the department head for remote sensing at that time. Jähn&#x27;s doctoral thesis, among other topics, was based on the scientific preparations and evaluations of various kinds of flight missions.

Jähn became one of the founding members of the Association of Space Explorers in 1985.

On March 1, 1986, Jähn was promoted to major general. Following the dissolution of the GDR on October 2, 1990, he was relieved from duty alongside the last remaining command staff of the NVA, like Major General Lothar Engelhardt and Admiral Theodor Hoffmann.

Jähn became a freelance consultant for the German Aerospace Center until 1993. He then worked for the European Space Agency, or ESA following their ongoing projects with the Russian space agency Roscosmos in Zvyozdny Gorodok. He obtained this position with the support of his West German colleague Ulf Merbold and remained there for the following 15 years. The two had met in 1984 during a conference held in Salzburg.

He retired in 2002. In 2011, on the 50th anniversary of the first human space flight by Yuri Gagarin, he explained to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that taking the &quot;Das Sandmännchen toy&quot; on his flight was not a personal choice, but rather he took the figurine in order to film material for the show.

== Private life ==

Sigmund Jähn lived in Strausberg with his wife, Erika Hänsel, and two daughters, Marina and Grit. He and his wife lived there until his passing on September 21, 2019, and was buried in the St. Mary&#x27;s Protestant Cemetery in Strausberg.

When Sigmund returned from his space flight, he was greeted by his family with a picture of his grandson. This was ultimately concealed by GDR news stations because his role as a grandfather wouldn&#x27;t have conformed to the desired image the space agency wanted to promote.

<text>Philipp Jakob Spener (23 January 1635 – 5 February 1705) was a German Lutheran theologian who essentially founded what became known as Pietism. He was later dubbed the &quot;Father of Pietism&quot;. A prolific writer, his two main works, &quot;Pia desideria&quot; (1675) and &quot;Allgemeine Gottesgelehrtheit&quot; (1680), were published while he was the chief pastor in the Lutheran Church at Frankfurt. 

In 1691, he was invited to Berlin by the court of Brandenburg. In Berlin, Spener was at odds with the predominant Lutheran orthodoxy, as he had been all his life. Spener influenced the foundation of the University of Halle. Disputing his positions, the theological faculty of Wittenberg, formally accused him of 264 errors.

==Life==
Spener was born in Rappoltsweiler, Upper Alsace, now part of France, in Spener&#x27;s time as part of the Holy Roman Empire. After a brief time at the grammar school of Colmar, he went to Strasbourg in 1651. There he devoted himself to the study of philology, history and philosophy, and won his degree of master in 1653, with a disputation against the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. He then became private tutor to the princes Christian and Charles of the Electorate of the Palatinate, and lectured in the university on philology and history. From 1659 to 1662 he visited the universities of Basel, Tübingen and Geneva, and commenced the study of heraldry, which he pursued throughout his life. In Geneva especially, his religious views and tendencies turned in the direction of mysticism.

Spener returned to Strasbourg in 1663, where he was appointed preacher without pastoral duties, with the right of holding lectures. Three years afterwards, he was invited to become the chief pastor in the Lutheran Church at Frankfurt. Here he published his two chief works, &quot;Pia desideria&quot; (1675) and &quot;Allgemeine Gottesgelehrtheit&quot; (1680), and began that form of pastoral work which resulted in the movement called Pietism.

In 1686 he accepted the invitation to the first court chaplaincy at Dresden. The Elector John George III, at whose personal desire the post had been offered to him, was soon offended when Spener condemned the morals of John George&#x27;s court. Spener refused to resign his post, and the Saxon government hesitated to dismiss him. In 1691 the Saxon representative at Berlin induced the court of Brandenburg to offer him the rectorship of St Nicholas in Berlin, with the title of counsellor of the Marcher Consistory (Konsistorialrat).

In Berlin, Spener was held in high honour, though the tendencies of the court and the government officials were rather rationalistic than pietistic. The University of Halle was founded under his influence in 1694. All his life, Spener had been exposed to the attacks and abuse of the orthodox Lutheran theologians. Over time, his opponents multiplied, and the movement which he started accumulated hostile criticism. In 1695 the theological faculty of Wittenberg formally accused him of 264 errors. Only his death released him from these fierce conflicts. His last important work was &quot;Theologische Bedenken&quot; (1700–1702), to which was added after his death &quot;Letzte theologische Bedenken&quot;, with a biography of Spener by CH von Canstein (1711). Spener died in Berlin.

==Theology==
Highly influenced by Johann Arndt, Lewis Bayly, Jean de Labadie, and Theophil Großgebauer, Spener&#x27;s own writings display an emphasis on personal transformation through spiritual rebirth and renewal. It is this focus on individual devotion and piety that places him within the realm of Pietism. Spener wanted to strengthen and renew the church through the development of more knowledgeable and devoted members.

In his &quot;Pia Desideria&quot;, he gave six proposals of how to enact this reform: (1) to more thoroughly acquaint believers with Scripture by means of private readings and study groups, in addition to preaching; (2) to increase the involvement of laity in all functions of the church; (3) to emphasize that believers put into practice their faith and knowledge of God; (4) to approach religious discussions with humility and love, avoiding controversy whenever possible; (5) to ensure that pastors are both well-educated and pious; and (6) to focus preaching on developing faith in ordinary believers. As these proposals indicate, Spener saw positive change for the church as being primarily dependent upon the pious involvement of individual believers.

Though Spener has been called the &quot;father of Pietism,&quot; Albrecht Ritschl (&quot;Geschichte des Pietismus&quot;, ii. 163) maintains that &quot;he was himself not a Pietist,&quot; as he did not advocate the quietistic, legalistic and semi-separatist practices of Pietism, though they were more or less involved in the positions he assumed or the practices which he encouraged or connived at. The only two points on which he departed from the orthodox Lutheran faith of his day were the requirement of regeneration as the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of the true theologian, and the expectation of the conversion of the Jews and the fall of the Papacy as the prelude of the triumph of the Church.

He did not, like the later Pietists, insist upon the necessity of a conscious crisis of conversion, nor did he encourage a complete breach between the Christian and the secular life. Spener was sometimes believed to be one of the godfathers of Count von Zinzendorf, the leader of the Moravian Brethren&#x27;s Community at Herrnhut in Saxony. Although Zinzendorf met Spener as a child at his grandmother&#x27;s home in Hennersdorf, Spener was not his godfather.

Spener was a prolific writer. The list of his published works comprises 7 vols. folio, 63 quarto, 7 octavo, 46 duodecimo. An edition of his chief writings was published by P. Grunberg in 1889. TVG Brunnen Verlag in Gießen, Germany began a new edition of Spener&#x27;s works in 1996.

<text>Optometry is a specialized health care profession that involves examining the eyes and related structures for defects or abnormalities. Optometrists are health care professionals who typically provide comprehensive eye care.

In the United States of America and Canada, optometrists are those that hold a 4-year Doctor of Optometry degree, which is earned following their undergraduate college training. They are trained and licensed to practice medicine for eye related conditions, in addition to providing refractive (optical) eye care. Within their scope of practice, optometrists are considered physicians and bill medical insurance(s) (example: Medicare) accordingly. 

In the United Kingdom, optometrists may also provide medical care (e.g. prescribe medications and perform various surgeries) for eye-related conditions in addition to providing refractive care. The Doctor of Optometry degree is rarer in the UK.

Many optometrists participate in academic research for eye-related conditions and diseases. In addition to prescribing glasses and contact lenses for vision related deficiencies, optometrists are trained in monitoring and treating ocular disease-pathologies. 

The range of training for optometrists varies greatly between countries. Some countries only require certificate training while others require a doctoral degree. 

In the United States, optometrists typically hold a four-year college degree, a four-year Doctor of Optometry degree, and have the option to complete a 1-year residency program.

By comparison, in the United States, ophthalmologists are medical doctors (MDs and DOs) who typically hold a four-year college degree, a four-year medical degree, and additional years of training after medical school in an ophthalmology residency (at least 4 years) during which they receive training in advanced medical management of eye disease and ocular surgery.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;optometry&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;&quot; (&quot;opsis&quot;; &quot;view&quot;) and &quot;&quot; (&quot;metron&quot;; &quot;something used to measure&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;). The word entered the language when the instrument for measuring vision was called an optometer, (before the terms phoropter or refractor were used). The root word &quot;opto&quot; is a shortened form derived from the Greek word &quot;ophthalmos&quot; meaning, &quot;eye.&quot; Like most healthcare professions, the education and certification of optometrists are regulated in most countries. Optometric professionals and optometry-related organizations interact with governmental agencies, other healthcare professionals, and the community to deliver eye and vision care.

==Definition of optometry and optometrist==

The World Council of Optometry, World Health Organization and about 75 optometry organizations from over 40 countries have adopted the following definition, to be used to describe optometry and optometrist.
==History==
Optometric history is tied to the development of
* vision science (related areas of medicine, microbiology, neurology, physiology, psychology, etc.)
* optics, optical aids
* optical instruments, imaging techniques
* other eye care professions

The history of optometry can be traced back to the early studies on optics and image formation by the eye. The origins of optical science (optics, as taught in a basic physics class) date back a few thousand years as evidence of the existence of lenses for decoration has been found in Greece and the Netherlands.

It is unknown when the first spectacles were made. The British scientist and historian Sir Joseph Needham, in his &quot;Science and Civilization in China&quot;, reported the earliest mention of spectacles was in Venetian guild regulations . He suggested that the occasional claim that spectacles were invented in China may have come from a paper by German-American anthropologist Berthold Laufer. Per Needham, the paper by Laufer had many inconsistencies, and that the references in the document used by Laufer were not in the original copies but added during the Ming dynasty. Early Chinese sources mention the eyeglasses were imported.

Research by David A. Goss in the United States shows they may have originated in the late 13th century in Italy as stated in a manuscript from 1305 where a monk from Pisa named Rivalto stated &quot;It is not yet 20 years since there was discovered the art of making eyeglasses&quot;. Spectacles were manufactured in Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands by 1300. Needham stated spectacles were first made shortly after 1286.

In 1907, Laufer stated in his history of spectacles &#x27;the opinion that spectacles originated in India is of the greatest probability and that spectacles must have been known in India earlier than in Europe&#x27;. However, as already mentioned, Joseph Needham showed that the references Laufer cited were not in the older and best versions of the document Laufer used, leaving his claims unsupported.

In Sri Lanka, it is well-documented that during the reign of King Bhuvanekabahu the IV (AD 1346 – 1353) of the Gampola period the ancient tradition of optical lens making with a natural stone called Diyatarippu was given royal patronage. A few of the craftsmen still live and practice in the original hamlet given to the exponents of the craft by royal decree. But the date of King Bhuvanekabahu is decades after the mention of spectacles in the Venetian guild regulations and after the 1306 sermon by Dominican friar Giordano da Pisa, where da Pisa said the invention of spectacles was both recent and that he had personally met the inventor 

The German word &quot;brille&quot; (eyeglasses) is derived from Sanskrit &quot;vaidurya&quot;. Etymologically, &quot;brille&quot; is derived from beryl, Latin &quot;beryllus&quot;, from Greek &quot;beryllos&quot;, from Prakrit &quot;verulia&quot;, &quot;veluriya&quot;, from Sanskrit &quot;vaidurya&quot;, of Dravidian origin from the city of &quot;Velur&quot; (modern &quot;Belur&quot;). Medieval Latin &quot;berillus&quot; was also applied to eyeglasses, hence German &quot;brille&quot;, from Middle High German &quot;berille&quot;, and French &quot;besicles&quot; (plural) &quot;spectacles&quot;, altered from old French &quot;bericle&quot;.

Benito Daza de Valdes published the first full book on opticians in 1623, where he mentioned the use and fitting of eyeglasses. In 1692, William Molyneux wrote a book on optics and lenses where he stated his ideas on myopia and problems related to close-up vision. The scientists Claudius Ptolemy and Johannes Kepler also contributed to the creation of optometry. Kepler discovered how the retina in the eye creates vision. From 1773 until around 1829, Thomas Young discovered the disability of astigmatism and it was George Biddell Airy who designed glasses to correct that problem that included sphero-cylindrical lens.

Although the term optometer appeared in the 1759 book &quot;A Treatise on the Eye: The Manner and Phenomena of Vision&quot; by Scottish physician William Porterfield, it was not until the early twentieth century in the United States and Australia that &quot;optometry&quot; began to be used to describe the profession. By the early twenty-first century, however, marking the distinction with dispensing opticians, it had become the internationally accepted term.

==Diseases==
A partial list of the common diseases optometrists diagnose/manage:

* Amblyopia
* Cataracts
* Corneal disease
* Diabetic retinopathy
* Dry eye syndrome
* Eye neoplasm
* Glaucoma
* Hypertensive retinopathy
* Macular degeneration
* Refractive error (including astigmatism) 
* Strabismus
* Uveitis

==Diagnosis==

===Eye examination===
Following are examples of examination methods performed during an eye examination that enables diagnosis
* Ocular tonometry to determine intraocular pressure
* Refraction assessment
* Retina examination
* Slit lamp examination
* Visual acuity
* Color vision test
* Visual field test
* Dry eye test
* Corneal topography

===Specialized tests===
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a medical technological platform used to assess ocular structures. The information is then used by eye doctors to assess staging of pathological processes and confirm clinical diagnoses. Subsequent OCT scans are used to assess the efficacy of managing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma

==Training, licensing, representation and scope of practice==
Optometry is officially recognized in many jurisdictions. Most have regulations concerning education and practice. Optometrists, like many other healthcare professionals, are required to participate in ongoing continuing education courses to stay current on the latest standards of care.

===Africa===
In 1993 there were five countries in Africa with optometric teaching institutes: Sudan, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Tanzania. Ethiopia started in 2002 at UoG. There are currently two universities (MMUST &amp; Kaimosi Friends University) offering Bachelor of Science in Optometry and Vision Sciences in Kenya.

====Sudan====
Sudan&#x27;s major institution for the training of optometrists is the Faculty of Optometry and Visual Sciences (FOVS), originally established in 1954 as the Institute of Optometry in Khartoum; the Institute joined with the Ministry of Higher Education in 1986 as the High Institute of Optometry, and was ultimately annexed into Alneelain University in 1997 when it was renamed the FOVS. The FOVS offers several programs: a BSc in Optometry, which takes 5 years and includes sub-specialization in orthoptics, contact lenses, ocular photography, or ocular neurology; a BSc in Ophthalmic Technology, requiring 4 years of training; and a BSc in Optical Dispensary, completed in 4 years. The FOVS also offers MSc and PhD degrees in optometry. The FOVS is the only institute of its kind in Sudan and was the first institution of higher education in Optometry in the Middle East and Africa. In 2010, Alneelain University Eye Hospital was established as part of the FOVS to expand training capacity and to serve broader Sudanese community.

====Ghana====
The Ghana Optometric Association (GOA) regulates the practice of Optometry in Ghana. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and the University of Cape Coast are the two universities that offer the degree programme in the country. After the six-year training at any of the two universities offering the course, the O.D. degree is awarded. The new optometrist must write a qualifying exam, after which the optometrist is admitted as a member of the GOA, leading to the award of the title MGOA.

====Mozambique====
The first optometry course in Mozambique was started in 2009 at Universidade Lurio, Nampula. The course is part of the Mozambique Eyecare Project. University of Ulster, Dublin Institute of Technology and Brien Holden Vision Institute are supporting partners. As of 2019, 61 Mozambican students had graduated with optometry degrees
from UniLúrio (34 male and 27 female).

====Nigeria====
In Nigeria, optometry is regulated by the Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians Registration Board of Nigeria established under the Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians (Registration etc.) Act of 1989 (Cap O9 Laws of Federation of Nigeria 2004). The Board publishes from time to time lists of approved qualifications and training institutions in the federal government gazette. 

Optometry education began at the University of Benin in 1970, initially as a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program, making it the first optometry school in West Africa. In 1980, Abia State University introduced the Doctor of Optometry program. The University of Benin upgraded its program to the Doctor of Optometry degree in 1994. Subsequently, Doctor of Optometry programs were established at other public and private universities. The Doctor of Optometry degree is awarded after six years of training at one of the accredited universities located in Edo, Imo, Kano, Kwara, and Abia states.

===Asia===

==== Bangladesh ====
Optometry was first introduced in Bangladesh in 2010 at the Institute of Community Ophthalmology under the Faculty of Medicine, University of Chittagong. This institute offers a four-year Bachelor of Science in Optometry (B.Optom) course. As of 2017, there are 200 graduate optometrists in Bangladesh. The association that controls the quality of optometry practice across the country is the Optometrists Association of Bangladesh, which is also a country member of the World Council of Optometry (WCO).

In 2018, Chittagong Medical University was established, and the BSc in Optometry course was transferred to this university.

In Bangladesh, optometrists perform primary eye care like diagnosis and primary management of some ocular diseases, prescribe eye glasses, low vision rehabilitation, provide vision therapy, contact lens practice and all type of orthoptic evaluations and therapies.

Registration from Government’s Health Ministry is still pending for unknown reason.

====China====

In China, optometric education only began in 1988 at the Wenzhou Medical University. Since that time, the discipline and the profession have emerged as a five-year, medically based program within the medical education system of China. Students in the program receive the highest level of training in Optometry and are provided with the credentials needed to assume positions of leadership in China&#x27;s medical education and health care systems. In 2000, the Ministry of Health formally accepted Optometry as a subspecialty of medicine.

==== Hong Kong ====
The Optometrists Board of the Supplementary Medical Professions Council regulates the profession in Hong Kong. Optometrists are listed in separate parts of the register based on their training and ability. Registrants are subject to restrictions depending on the part they are listed in. Those who pass the examination on refraction conducted by the Board may be registered to Part III, thereby restricted to practice only work related to refraction. Those who have a Higher Certificate in Optometry or have passed the Board&#x27;s optometry examination may be registered to Part II, thereby restricted in their use of diagnostic agents, but may otherwise practice freely. Part I optometrists may practice without restrictions and generally hold a bachelor&#x27;s degree or a Professional Diploma.

There are around 2000 optometrists registered in Hong Kong, 1000 of which are Part I. There is one Part I optometrist to about 8000 members of the public. The Polytechnic University runs the only optometry school. It produces around 35 Part I optometrists a year.

====India====
In 2010, it was estimated that India needed 115,000 optometrists. In contrast, India has approximately 15,000 optometrists Bachelor of Optometry (4-year trained as per University Grant Commission Notification 5 July 2014 ) and 50,000 Diploma in Optometry (2-year trained diploma conferred By State Medical Faculty). In order to prevent blindness or visual impairment more well-trained optometrists are required in India. The definition of optometry differs considerably in different countries. India needs more optometry schools offering four-year degree courses with a syllabus similar to that in force in those countries where the practice of optometry is statutorily regulated and well established with an internationally accepted definition.

In 2013, it was reported in the &quot;Indian Journal of Ophthalmology&quot; that poor spectacle compliance amongst school children in rural Pune resulted in significant vision loss.

In 2015, it was reported that optometrists need to be more involved in providing core optometry services like binocular vision and low vision.

===== History of Optometry Education in India =====
1. In the beginning optometry education started in India during British rule in 1927, the first college was established in West Bengal with the name The Indian College of Optics and the certification was diploma in optometry.

After the independence of India, the Directorate General Of Health Services (DGHS) Government of India in 1958, introduced the first (by the Central Government of india) optometry education in the form of a Diploma in Optometry with the collaboration of UP State Medical Faculty, Government Of Utter Pradesh, under the 2nd 5-year plan. The government offered diplomas in optometry courses of two years duration conferred by State Medical Faculties, empowered under the Indian Medical Degree Act, 1916 (as per Government of India Notification Department of Education, Health and Lands No,1964 dated 16 December 1926, effective from 15 November 1929). The first two schools of optometry were established at Gandhi Eye Hospital, Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, (the first School of Optometry started by Prof.(Dr) Mohan Lal) and at Sarojini Devi Eye Hospital, Hyderabad in Telangana.

2. Subsequently, four more schools were opened across India, situated at Sitapur Eye Hospital, Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh; Chennai (formerly Madras) in Tamil Nadu; Bengalooru (formerly Bangalore) in Karnataka; and the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum) in Kerala.

3. The Elite School of Optometry (ESO) was established in 1985 in Chennai (The first school of optometry/college started by Prof.(Dr) S. Badrinath) and was the first to offer a four-year degree course Baccalaureate of Science in Optometry (B.S. Optometry). The degree was conferred only by the Shanker Netraliya (Elite School of Optometry and the first principal was Dr. E. Vaithilingam) instead of any University or State Government Authority etc. After that, the B.S. in Optometry (under off-campus mode) was affiliated with Bitis Pilani University, Rajasthan, and now the same course re-affiliated with the new University of State of Tamilnadu, India.

4. The School of Optometry at Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University, Pune, established in 1998, was the first to offer a four-year degree course and confer a Bachelor of Clinical Optometry. The university also provided a pathway for diploma holders to upgrade their education to a Degree of Optometry through a lateral entry program. Also, the first 2 years of the Master of Optometry course were introduced in 2003.

5. AIIMS-Delhi introduced a two-year Diploma in Clinical Technology-Optometry (D.C.T. in Optometry) in 1973 and then upgraded the Diploma course to a 3-year B.Sc. (H) in Ophthalmic Technique in 1975. After that, the nomenclature to degree and course of duration changed from B.Sc. (H) to Bachelor of Optometry, four-year duration as per UGC Notification 2014 in the year new first batch of students passed out in the year 2019.

6. At present, there are more than fifty schools of optometry and colleges in India, and over 100 universities confer Bachelor of Optometry (B.Optom) and Master of Optometry (M.Optom) professional degrees. Additionally, Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Optometry are awarded by universities recognized by the University Grants Commission (India), a statutory body responsible for maintaining standards of higher education in India.

Optometrists across India are encouraged to register under the National Commission for Allied and Healthcare Professions Act, 2021, which was enacted by the Parliament of India in 2021. The Delhi Optometrists Association (DOA) has endorsed all updates related to optometry education in India.

====Malaysia====
It takes four years to complete a degree in optometry. As of 2022, optometry courses have been well received by citizens, with nearly 3,000 registered optometrists. More universities and higher education studies are about to implement the courses, such as the National Institute of Ophthalmic Sciences in Petaling Jaya. Other public universities that offer this course include University Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). There are also private universities that offer this course such as Management and Science University (MSU) and SeGi University. After completing the Degree in Optometry, optometrists who practice in Malaysia must register with the Malaysian Optical Council (MOC), which is an organization under the Ministry of Health.

The Association of Malaysian Optometrists (AMO) is the only body that represents the Malaysian optometrist profession. All of the members are either local or overseas graduates in the field of optometry.

====Pakistan====
Optometry is taught as a five/four-year Doctor/ Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors course at many institutions notable among which are Department of Optometry &amp; Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore, Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology (PICO) Peshawar, Pakistan institute of Rehabilitation science Isra University campus Islamabad (PIRS), College of Ophthalmology &amp; Allied Vision Sciences (COAVS) Lahore and Al-Shifa Institute of Ophthalmology Islamabad. After graduation, the optometrists can join a four-tiered service delivery level (Centre of Excellence, Tertiary/Teaching, District headquarter and sub-district /Tehsil headquarters). M.Phil. in Optometry is also available at select institutions such as King Edward Medical University, Lahore. Department of Optometry &amp; Vision Sciences (DOVS) FAHS, ICBS, Lahore started bridging programmes for Bachelors/ Bachelors with Honors to become Doctor of Optometry OD, Post Professional Doctor of Optometry (PP-OD), Transitional Doctor of Optometry (t-OD). Optometry is not yet a regulated field in Pakistan as there is no professional licensing board or authority responsible for issuing practise licenses to qualified optometrists. This creates difficulty for Pakistani optometrists who wish to register abroad. The University of Lahore has recently launched Doctor of Optometry (OD). Imam Hussain Medical University also launched the Doctor of Optometry Program. The chairman of Imam Hussain Medical University, Sabir Hussain Babachan, vowed to regulate the OD curriculum according to international standards.

====Philippines====
Optometry is regulated by the Professional Regulation Commission of the Philippines. To be eligible for licensing, each candidate must have satisfactorily completed a doctor of optometry course at an accredited institution and demonstrate good moral character with no previous record of professional misconduct. Professional organizations of optometry in the Philippines include Optometric Association of the Philippines and Integrated Philippine Association of Optometrists, Inc. (IPAO).

====Saudi Arabia====
In Saudi Arabia, optometrists must complete a five-year doctor of optometry degree from Qassim University and King Saud University. Also, they must complete a one-year residency.

====Singapore====
Tertiary education for optometrists consists of a 3-year diploma in optometry offered at institutions such as Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic

====Taiwan====
The education of optometry in Taiwan commenced in 1982 at Shu-Zen College of Medicine and Management. Bachelor degrees in optometry can be obtained from seven universities (North to South): University of Kang Ning, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Asia University, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Chung Shan Medical University, Dayeh University, and Chung Hwa University of Medical Technology; whereas associate degrees in optometry can be obtained from Mackay Junior College of Medicine, Nursing and Management, Hsin Sheng College of Medical Care and Management, Jen-Teh Junior College of Medicine, Nursing, and Management, and Shu-Zen College of Medicine and Management.

The Law of Optometrists was established in Taiwan in 2015; since then, optometry students after obtaining optometry degrees, need to pass the National Optometry Examination of Taiwan to be registered as optometrists. There are approximately 4,000 optometrists in Taiwan as of 2020, and around 400 new optometrists register annunally (2018-2020).

====Thailand====
Since late 1990, Thailand has set a goal to provide more than 600 optometrists to meet the minimal public demands and international standards in vision care. There are more than three university degree programs in Thailand. Each program accepts students that have completed grade 12th or the third year in high school (following US education model). These programs offer &quot;Doctor of Optometry&quot; degree to graduates from the program that will take six years to complete the courses. Practising optometrists will also be required to pass licensing examination (three parts examinations) that is administrated through a committee under the Ministry of Public Health.

As of 2015, the number of practicing optometrists in Thailand is still fewer than one hundred. However, it has projected that the number of practising optometrists in Thailand will greatly increase within the next ten years. In the theoretical scenario, the number of optometrists should be able to meet minimal public demands around 2030 or earlier.

===Europe===
Since the formation of the European Union, &quot;there exists a strong movement, headed by the Association of European Schools and Colleges of Optometry (AESCO), to unify the profession by creating a European-wide examination for optometry&quot; and presumably also standardized practice and education guidelines within EU countries. The first examinations of the new European Diploma in Optometry were held in 1998 and this was a landmark event for optometry in continental Europe.

====France====
As of July 2003, there was no regulatory framework and optometrists were sometimes trained by completing an apprenticeship at an ophthalmologists&#x27; private office.

====Germany====
Optometric tasks are performed by ophthalmologists and professionally trained and certified opticians.

====Greece====
Hellenic Ministry of Education founded the first department of Optometry at Technological Educational Institute of Patras in 2007. After protests from the department of Optics at Technological Educational Institute of Athens (the only department of Optics in Greece, until 2006), the Government changed the names of the departments to &quot;Optics and Optometry&quot; and included lessons in both optics and optometry. Optometrists-Opticians have to complete a 4-year undergraduate honours degree. Then the graduates can be admitted to postgraduate courses in Optometry at universities around the world.

Since 2015, a Master of Science (MSc) course in Optometry is offered by the Technological Educational Institute of Athens.

The Institute of Vision and Optics (IVO) of the University of Crete focuses on the sciences of vision and is active in the fields of research, training, technology development and provision of medical services. Professor Ioannis Pallikaris has received numerous awards and recognitions for the institute&#x27;s contribution to ophthalmology. In 1989 he performed the first LASIK procedure on a human eye.

====Hungary====
Optometrist education takes 4 years in the medical universities in Hungary, and they will get a Bachelor of Science degree. They work in networks and retail stores and private optics, very few are located in the Health Care care system as ophthalmologists as an assistant.

====Ireland====
The profession of Optometry has been represented for over a century by the Association of Optometrists, Ireland [AOI]. In Ireland an optometrist must first complete a four-year degree in optometry at Dublin Institute of Technology. Following successful completion of the degree, an optometrist must then complete professional qualifying examinations to enter the register of the Opticians Board [Bord na Radharcmhaistoiri]. Optometrists must be registered with the Board to practice in the Republic of Ireland.

The A.O.I. runs a comprehensive continuing education and professional development program on behalf of Irish optometrists. The legislation governing optometry was drafted in 1956. Some feel that the legislation restricts optometrists from using their full range of skills, training and equipment for the benefit of the Irish public. The amendment to the Act in 2003 addressed one of the most significant restrictions: the use of cycloplegic drugs to examine children.

====Italy====
In Italy Optometry is an unregulated profession. It is taught at seven universities: Padua, Turin, Milan, Salento, Florence, Naples and Rome, as three years course (like a BSc) of &quot;Scienze e tecnologie fisiche&quot; as a sector of the Physics Department. Additionally, courses are available at some private institutions (as at Vinci Institute near Firenze) that offer advanced professional education for already qualified opticians (most of the Italian optometrists are also qualified opticians, i.e. &quot;ottico abilitato&quot;). In the last thirty years several verdicts from High Court (Cassazione) proof that optometry is a free practice and has truly education path.

====Norway====
In Norway, the optometric profession has been regulated as a healthcare profession since 1988. After a three-year bachelor program, one can practice basic optometry. At least one year in clinical practice qualify for a post-degree half-year sandwich course in contact lens fitting, which is regulated as a healthcare speciality. A separate regulation for the use of diagnostic drugs in optometric practice was introduced in 2004.

====Russia====
In Russia, optometry education has been accredited by the Federal Agency of Health and Social Development.
There are only two educational institutions that teach optometry in Russia: Saint Petersburg Medical Technical College, formerly known as St. Petersburg College of Medical Electronics and Optics, and The Helmholtz Research Institute for Eye Diseases. They both belong and are regulated by the Ministry of Health. The optometry program is a four-year program. It includes one to two science foundation years, one yer focused on clinical and proficiency skills, and one year of clinical rotations in hospitals. Graduates take college/state examinations and then receive a specialist diploma. This diploma is valid for only five years and must be renewed every five years after receiving additional training at state-accredited programs.

The scope of practice for optometrists in Russia includes refraction, contact lens fitting, spectacles construction and lens fitting (dispensing), low vision aids, foreign body removal, referrals to other specialists after clinical condition diagnoses (management of diseases in the eye).

====United Kingdom====
===== Licensing =====
Optometrists in the United Kingdom are regulated by the General Optical Council under the Opticians Act 1989 and distinguished from medical practitioners. Registration with the GOC is mandatory to practice optometry in the UK. Members of the College of Optometrists (incorporated by a Royal Charter granted by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II) may use the suffix MCOptom.

The National Health Service provides free sight tests and spectacle vouchers for children and those on very low incomes. The elderly and those with some chronic conditions like diabetes get free periodic tests. Treatment for eye conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts is free and checked for during normal eye examinations.

===== Training =====
In the United Kingdom, optometrists have to complete a 4-year undergraduate honours degree followed by a minimum of a one-year internship, &quot;pre-registration period&quot;, during which they complete clinical practice under the supervision of a qualified and experienced practitioner. During this year the pre-registration candidate is given a number of quarterly assessments, often including temporary posting at a hospital, and on successfully passing all of these assessments, a final one-day set of examinations (details correct for candidates from 2006). Following successful completion of these assessments and having completed one year&#x27;s supervised practice, the candidate is eligible to register as an optometrist with the General Optical Council (GOC) and, should they so wish, are entitled to membership of the College of Optometrists. Twelve universities offer Optometry in the UK: Anglia Ruskin, Aston, Bradford, Cardiff, City, Glasgow Caledonian, Hertfordshire, Manchester, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Ulster at Coleraine and West of England. 

In 2008 the UK moved forward to offer the Doctor of Optometry postgraduate programme. This became available at the Institute of Optometry in London in partnership with London South Bank University. The Doctor of Optometry postgraduate degree is also offered at one other UK institution: Aston University.

===== Scope of Practice =====
In 1990, a survey of the opinions of British medical practitioners regarding the services provided by British optometrists was carried out by Agarwal at City, University of London. A majority of respondents were in favour of optometrists extending their professional role by treating external eye conditions and prescribing broad-spectrum topical antibiotics through additional training and certification.

Since 2009, optometrists in the UK have been able to undertake additional postgraduate training and qualifications that allow them to prescribe medications to treat and manage eye conditions. There are currently three registerable specialities:
* Additional supply speciality – to write orders for, and supply in an emergency, a range of drugs in addition to those ordered or supplied by a normal optometrist.
* Supplementary prescribing speciality – to manage a patient&#x27;s clinical condition and prescribe medicines according to a clinical management plan set up in conjunction with an independent prescriber, such as a GP or ophthalmologist or qualified optometrist.
* Independent prescribing specialty – to take responsibility for the clinical assessment of a patient, establish a diagnosis and determine the clinical management required, including prescribing where necessary.

Optometrists in the United Kingdom are able to diagnose and manage most ocular diseases, and may also undertake further training to perform certain surgical procedures.

===North America===
====Canada====
===== Training =====
In Canada, Doctors of Optometry typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four to five years of optometry studies, accredited by the Accreditation Council on Optometric Education. There are two such schools of optometry located in Canada — the University of Waterloo and the Université de Montreal. Canada also recognizes degrees from the twenty US schools.

===== Licensing =====
In Canada, Doctors of Optometry must write national written and practical board exams. Additionally, optometrists are required to become licensed in the province in which they wish to practice. Regulation of professions is within provincial jurisdiction. Therefore, regulation of optometry is unique to individual provinces and territories. In Ontario, optometrists are licensed by the College of Optometrists of Ontario.

===== Representation =====
In Canada, the profession is represented by the Canadian Association of Optometrists. In the province of Ontario, the Ontario Association of Optometrists is the designated representative of optometrists to the provincial government.

===== Scope of Practice =====
Optometrists in Canada are trained and licensed to be primary eye care providers. They provide optical and medical eye care. They are able to diagnose and treat most eye diseases and can prescribe both topical and oral medications. They can also undertake further qualifications in order to perform some surgical procedures.

====United States====
Optometrists, Doctors of Optometry, or Optometric Physicians are primary eye care providers. They provide comprehensive optical and medical eye care. They are trained and licensed to practice medicine for eye related conditions - prescribe topical medications (prescription eye drops), oral medications as well as administer diagnostic agents. In some states, optometrists may also be licensed to perform certain types of eye surgery.

===== Scope of practice =====
Optometrists provide optical and medical eye care. They prescribe corrective lenses to aid refractive errors (e.g. myopia, hyperopia, presbyopia, astigmatism, double vision). They manage vision development in children including amblyopia diagnosis/treatment. Some perform vision therapy. They are trained to diagnose and manage any eye disease and their associations with systemic health. Optometrists are trained and licensed to practice medicine for eye-related conditions (including bacterial/viral infections, inflammation, glaucoma, macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy). They can prescribe all topical medications (eye drops) and most oral medications (taken by mouth), including scheduled controlled substances. They may also remove ocular foreign bodies and order blood panels or imaging studies such as CT or MRI. Optometrists do not perform invasive surgery, however In Oklahoma and Louisiana, Optometrists may perform superficial surgeries within the anterior segment of the eye. Legislation permits Optometrists in Oklahoma and Kentucky to perform certain laser procedures.

Within their scope of practice optometrists are considered physicians and bill medical insurance plans accordingly.

Optometrists in the United States are regulated by state boards, which vary from state to state.

The Association of Regulatory Boards of Optometry (ARBO) assists these state board licensing agencies in regulating the practice of optometry.

===== Licensing =====
Optometrists must complete all course work and graduate from an accredited College of Optometry. This includes passage of all parts of the national board examinations as well as local jurisprudence examinations, which vary by state.

===== Education and Training =====
Optometrists typically complete four years of undergraduate studies followed by four years of Optometry school. Some complete a 5th year of training. Their program is highly specific to the eyes and related structures. Optometrists receive their medical eye training while enrolled in Optometry school and during internships. Training may take place in colleges of Optometry, hospitals, clinics and private practices. In many instances Optometry students and Ophthalmology residents will co-manage medical cases. Instructors may be Optometrists, professors or physicians. The program includes extensive classroom and clinical training in geometric, physical, physiological and ophthalmic optics, specialty contact lens evaluation, general anatomy, ocular anatomy, ocular disease, pharmacology, ocular pharmacology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the visual system, pediatric visual development, gerontology, binocular vision, color vision, form, space, movement and vision perception, systemic disease, histology, microbiology, sensory and perceptual psychology, biochemistry, statistics and epidemiology.

Optometrists are required to obtain continuing education credit hours to maintain licensure - number of hours varies by state.

Optometrists prescribing schedule controlled substances are required to renew their DEA license every few years.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
Australia currently has six recognized courses in optometry, and one course seeking to obtain accreditation with the Optometry council of Australia and New Zealand:
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry (BVisSci MOptom), Deakin University
* Bachelor of Medical Science (Vision Science) and Master of Optometry, Flinders University
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Clinical Optometry (BVisSc MClinOptom), University of New South Wales
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, Queensland University of Technology
* Bachelor of Vision Science and Master of Optometry, University of Canberra
* Doctor of Optometry, Melbourne University (post-graduate)
* Doctor of Optometry, University of Western Australia (post-graduate)

To support these courses the Australian College of Optometry provides clinical placements to undergraduate students from Australian Universities and abroad.

in 2016, almost 5000 optometrists in general practice were licensed with their regulatory body, the Optometry Board of Australia. Of these, approximately 2300 were registered with the scheduled medicines endorsement, which enables them to prescribe some medicines for the treatment of conditions of the eye. The Optometrists Association of Australia works to protect the interests of optometrists in Australia.

====New Zealand====
New Zealand currently has one recognised course in optometry:
* Bachelor of Optometry (BOptom), The University of Auckland

In July 2014, the Medicines Amendment Act 2013 and Misuse of Drugs Amendment Regulations 2014 came into effect. Among other things, the changes to the Act name optometrists as authorised prescribers. This change enables optometrists with a therapeutic pharmaceutical agent (TPA) endorsement to prescribe all medicines appropriate to their scope of practice, rather than limiting them to a list of medicines specified in the regulation; this recognises the safe and appropriate prescribing practice of optometrists over the previous nine years.

===South America===
====Brazil====

The CBOO (Brazilian Council of Optics and Optometry), which is affiliated to the WCO (World Council of Optometry), represents Brazilian optometrists. In conjunction with organizations representative weight of Brazilian companies, including the National Commerce Confederation for goods, services and tourism (CNC), through the CBÓptica/CNC, its defence arm of the optometric and optical industry, are defending the right of free and independent practice of optometrists, even if it is against the interests of ophthalmologists.

The Federal Supreme Court (STF), the Brazilian Court of Justice and the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), another important National Court, ruled several processes granting inquestionable victories to ophthalmologists.

In Brazilian law, however, there is an explicit recommendation that the one prescribing corrective lenses are prohibited to sell them. This restricting rule to the ophthalmologists has to keep the optic shops away from Hospitals and Eye Care Clinics since 1930, and it has to be reviewed before any further regulation for the optometrists.

====Colombia====
In Colombia, optometry education has been accredited by the Ministry of Health. The last official revision to the laws regarding healthcare standards in the country was issued in 1992 through the Law 30. Currently there are eight official universities that are entitled by ICFES to grant the optometrist certification. The first optometrists arrived in the country from North America and Europe . These professionals specialized in optics and refraction. In 1933, under Decrees 449 and 1291, the Colombian Government officially set the rules for the formation of professionals in the field of optometry. In 1966 La Salle University opened its first Faculty of Optometry after a recommendation from a group of professionals. At present optometrists are encouraged to keep up with new technologies through congresses and scholarships granted by the government or the private sector (such as Bausch &amp; Lomb).

<text>Beverly Atlee Cleary (née Bunn; April 12, 1916March 25, 2021) was an American writer of children&#x27;s and young adult fiction. One of America&#x27;s most successful authors, 91 million copies of her books have been sold worldwide since her first book was published in 1950. Some of her best known characters are Ramona Quimby and Beezus Quimby, Henry Huggins and his dog Ribsy, and Ralph S. Mouse.

The majority of Cleary&#x27;s books are set in the Grant Park neighborhood of northeast Portland, Oregon, where she was raised, and she has been credited as one of the first authors of children&#x27;s literature to figure emotional realism in the narratives of her characters, often children in middle-class families. Her first children&#x27;s book was &quot;Henry Huggins&quot;, which she wrote after receiving a question from a child when Cleary was a librarian. Cleary won the 1981 National Book Award for &quot;Ramona and Her Mother&quot; and the 1984 Newbery Medal for &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot;. For her lifetime contributions to American literature, she received the National Medal of Arts, recognition as a Library of Congress Living Legend, and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal from the Association for Library Service to Children. The Beverly Cleary School, a public school in Portland, was named after her, and several statues of her most famous characters were erected in Grant Park in 1995. Cleary died on March 25, 2021, at the age of 104.

==Early life==

Beverly Atlee Bunn was born on April 12, 1916, in McMinnville, Oregon, to Chester Lloyd Bunn, a farmer, and Mable Atlee Bunn, a schoolteacher. Cleary was an only child and lived on a farm in rural Yamhill, Oregon, in her early childhood. She was raised Presbyterian. When she was six years old, her family moved to Portland, Oregon, where her father had secured a job as a bank security officer.

The adjustment from living in the country to the city was difficult for Cleary, and she struggled in school; in first grade, her teacher placed her in a group for struggling readers. Cleary said, &quot;The first grade was sorted into three reading groups—Bluebirds, Redbirds and Blackbirds. I was a Blackbird. To be a Blackbird was to be disgraced. I wanted to read, but somehow could not.&quot;

With some work, Cleary&#x27;s reading skills improved, but she eventually found reading boring, complaining that many stories were simple and unsurprising, and wondering why authors often did not write with humor or about ordinary people. However, on a rainy afternoon at home during Cleary&#x27;s third-grade year, she found herself enjoying reading &quot;The Dutch Twins&quot;, a book by Lucy Fitch Perkins about the adventures of ordinary children. The book was an epiphany for her, and afterward, she started to spend a lot of time reading and at the library. By sixth grade, a teacher suggested that Cleary should become a children&#x27;s writer based on essays she had written for class assignments.

After graduating from Portland&#x27;s Grant High School in 1934, Cleary entered Chaffey Junior College in Ontario, California, which offered lower tuition fees than four-year universities, something many students needed during the Great Depression, with aspirations of becoming a children&#x27;s librarian. After two years at Chaffey, she was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1938. While in college, Cleary worked odd jobs to pay her tuition, including working as a seamstress and a chambermaid. During what Cleary described as &quot;two of the most interesting years of my life&quot;, she was one of the first residents of women&#x27;s cooperative Stebbins Hall, and met her future husband, Clarence Cleary, at a school dance. In 1939, she graduated from the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington with a second bachelor&#x27;s degree in library science and accepted a year-long position as a children&#x27;s librarian in Yakima, Washington. Her parents disapproved of her relationship with Cleary, a Roman Catholic, so the couple eloped and were married in 1940. After World War II, they settled in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. In 1955, Cleary gave birth to twins, Malcolm and Marianne. She lived in Carmel Valley Village in California from the 1960s onwards. 

==Career==

After her graduation from the University of Washington in 1939, she served as a children&#x27;s librarian in Yakima, Washington, until 1940, and then as the post librarian at the U.S. Army Hospital on Camp John T. Knight in Oakland, California, from 1942 to 1945. She also worked at Sather Gate Book Shop in Berkeley before becoming a full-time writer for children.

As a children&#x27;s librarian, Cleary empathized with her young patrons, who had difficulty finding books with characters they could identify with, and she struggled to find enough books to suggest that would appeal to them. After a few years of making recommendations and performing live storytelling in her role as librarian, Cleary decided to start writing children&#x27;s books about characters that young readers could relate to. Cleary has said, &quot;I believe in that &#x27;missionary spirit&#x27; among children&#x27;s librarians. Kids deserve books of literary quality, and librarians are so important in encouraging them to read and selecting books that are appropriate.&quot;

Cleary&#x27;s first book, &quot;Henry Huggins&quot; (1950), was the first in a series of fictional chapter books about Henry, his dog Ribsy, his neighborhood friend Beezus and her little sister Ramona. When writing the book, Cleary took inspiration from the times she composed stories for children during Saturday afternoon story hours when she worked as a librarian in Yakima. Like many of her later works, &quot;Henry Huggins&quot; is a novel about people living ordinary lives and is based on Cleary&#x27;s own childhood experiences, the kids in her neighborhood growing up, as well as children she met while working as a librarian. Although her book was accepted by Morrow, the first publisher she sent it to, it had been initially rejected, and Cleary had added the characters of Beezus and Ramona while revising it.

Cleary&#x27;s first book to center a story on the Quimby sisters, &quot;Beezus and Ramona&quot;, was published in 1955. A publisher asked her to write a book about a kindergarten student. Cleary resisted, because she had not attended kindergarten, but later changed her mind after the birth of her twins.

Cleary also wrote two memoirs, one about her childhood, entitled &quot;A Girl from Yamhill&quot; (1988), and one about her years in college and as an adult up to writing her first book, entitled &quot;My Own Two Feet&quot; (1995). During a 2011 interview for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, at age 95, Cleary stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve had an exceptionally happy career.&quot;

==Critical significance==
Cleary&#x27;s books have been historically noted for their attention to the daily minutiae of childhood, specifically the experience of children growing up in middle-class families. Leonard S. Marcus, a children&#x27;s literature historian, said of Cleary&#x27;s work: &quot;When you&#x27;re the right age to read Cleary&#x27;s books you&#x27;re likely at your most impressionable time in life as a reader. [Her books] both entertain children and give them courage and insight into what to expect from their lives.&quot; Cleary&#x27;s employment of humor has also been noted by critics; William Grimes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Cleary used a &quot;humorous, lively style&quot; while &quot;ma[king] compelling drama out of the everyday problems, small injustices and perplexing mysteries – adults chief among them – that define middle-class American childhood&quot;, while Roger Sutton of &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; noted that &quot;Cleary is funny in a very sophisticated way. She gets very close to satire, which I think is why adults like her, but she&#x27;s still deeply respectful of her characters—nobody gets a laugh at the expense of another. I think kids appreciate that they&#x27;re on a level playing field with adults.&quot;

Pat Pflieger, professor of children&#x27;s literature at West Chester University, commented: &quot;Cleary&#x27;s books have lasted because she understands her audience. She knows they&#x27;re sometimes confused or frightened by the world around them, and that they feel deeply about things that adults can dismiss.&quot; Eliza Dresang, professor in children and youth services at the University of Washington Information School, Cleary&#x27;s alma mater, said, &quot;Those books don&#x27;t seem so radical now, but they were when she was writing them&quot;. Dresang added that Cleary&#x27;s writing, &quot;in terms of the topics [covered], the honesty, the accuracy, [and] the ability to portray real-life children&quot;, was decades ahead of her time. &quot;Twentieth-Century Children&#x27;s Writers&quot; said, &quot;Beverly Cleary&#x27;s impact as a children&#x27;s writer cannot be overestimated... her extraordinary talent in creating memorable young characters whose exuberant spirit and zest for life attract young and old readers alike.&quot;

==Later life==
Cleary’s husband, Clarence, died in 2004. She celebrated her 100th birthday on April 12, 2016. On March 25, 2021, Cleary died at her retirement home in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, aged 104.

==Honors and legacy==

In 1975, Cleary won the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award from the American Library Association for &quot;substantial and lasting contributions to children&#x27;s literature&quot;. She was the U.S. nominee for the biennial international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1984. In April 2000, she was named Library of Congress Living Legend in the writers and artists category for her contributions to the cultural heritage of the United States. She received the National Medal of Arts in 2003.

Cleary&#x27;s books have been published in over 25 different languages and have been recognized by many awards and honors. &quot;Dear Mr. Henshaw&quot; won the Newbery Medal in 1984, and Newbery Honors were conferred on &quot;Ramona and Her Father&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Ramona Quimby, Age 8&quot; in 1982. She won the 1981 National Book Award in category children&#x27;s fiction (paperback) for &quot;Ramona and Her Mother&quot;, a William Allen White Children&#x27;s Book award for &quot;Socks&quot; (1973), the Catholic Library Association&#x27;s Regina Medal (1980), and the Children&#x27;s Book Council&#x27;s Every Child Award (1985).

In 2012, &quot;Ramona the Pest&quot; was ranked number 24 among all children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by the &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with a primarily U.S. audience. &quot;The Mouse and the Motorcycle&quot; (89) and &quot;Ramona and Her Father&quot; (94) were also among the top 100.

Cleary has been mentioned as a major influence by other authors, including Laurie Halse Anderson, Judy Blume, Lauren Myracle, and Jon Scieszka.

Publisher HarperCollins recognizes Cleary&#x27;s birthday, April 12, as National Drop Everything and Read (DEAR) Day, in promotion of sustained silent reading.
In Portland, Oregon, the Hollywood branch of the Multnomah County Library, near where she lived as a child, commissioned a map of Henry Huggins&#x27;s Klickitat Street neighborhood for its lobby wall. Statues of her characters Henry Huggins, the Hugginses&#x27; dog Ribsy, and Ramona Quimby can be found in The Beverly Cleary Sculpture Garden for Children, which is part of Portland&#x27;s Grant Park in the Hollywood-Fernwood neighborhood. In June 2008, the neighborhood&#x27;s K-8 school, formerly named Fernwood Grammar School and once attended by Cleary, was officially renamed Beverly Cleary School.

In 1997, the Central Library in downtown Portland, Oregon, which serves as the main branch of the Multnomah County Library system, dedicated its children&#x27;s room as the Beverly Cleary Children&#x27;s Library.

In 2004, the University of Washington Information School completed fund-raising for the Beverly Cleary Endowed Chair for Children and Youth Services to honor her work and commitment to librarianship. In 2008, the school announced that she had been selected as the next recipient of the university&#x27;s Alumna Summa Laude Dignatus Award, the highest honor the University of Washington can bestow on a graduate.

Cleary has a 220-student residential hall named after her, Beverly Cleary Hall, at her alma mater, the University of California, Berkeley.

In April 2016, on the occasion of her 100th birthday, Oregon Public Broadcasting produced an original half-hour program, &quot;Discovering Beverly Cleary&quot;, which included an extensive interview with Cleary at age 99 at her home in Carmel, California, and photographs and stories from her life. It was broadcast in the spring of 2016 on PBS stations across the country.

On April 22, 2021, after her death, the United States Senate passed a resolution &quot;honoring the life and legacy of award-winning children&#x27;s author Beverly Cleary.&quot; It was sponsored by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, Cleary&#x27;s home state.

<doc id="181228" wikidata="Q604285" url="?curid=181228" title="Mehmet Fuat Köprülü">
<text>Mehmet Fuat Köprülü (December 5, 1890 – June 28, 1966), also known as Köprülüzade Mehmed Fuad, was a highly influential Turkish sociologist, Turkologist, scholar, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey. A descendant of the prominent Köprülü family, Fuat Köprülü was a key figure in the intersection of scholarship and politics in early 20th century Turkey.

== Early life ==
Fuat Köprülü was born in the city of Istanbul in 1890 as Köprülüzade Mehmed Fuad. His father was Faiz Efendi, an Islamic judge. His mother Hatice Hanim was the daughter of an Islamic scholar. 

His paternal grandfather, Ahmet Ziya Bey, was the former ambassador to Bucharest, and Ahmet Ziya Bey was son of the former head of the Imperial Chancery of State (Dîvân-i Hümâyun Beylikçisi), Köprülüzade Arif Bey. Köprülüzade Arif Bey descended from the Köprülüs of the 17th century, an exceptional dynasty of Grand Viziers whose reforms and conquests delayed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Fuat Köprülü was named after the first Grand Vizier of the Köprülü Era, Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.

Fuat Köprülü received his formal education at the Ayasofya Middle and Mercan High schools, both products of the Ottoman educational reforms of the 19th century. In 1905, while a student at Mercan High School and only 15 years old, the magazine &quot;Musavver Terakki&quot; published three poems by Fuat Köprülü. By the time he entered the Istanbul University School of Law at the age of 17, Fuat Köprülü already had an excellent command of French, Persian and Arabic. His first book, &quot;Hayat-i Fikriyye&quot; (The Intellectual Life), was published when he was 19 years old. After three years of study, Fuat Köprülü abandoned the School of Law because of the poor quality of instruction, saying that diploma was not worth the loss of time it would entail.

==Career==

=== The Making of a Nationalist Intellectual ===

From 1910 to 1913, Fuat Köprülü taught Turkish and literature at various high schools in Istanbul, including the prestigious Galatasaray High School. Fuat Köprülü initially opposed the literary movement known as New Language [&quot;yeni lisan&quot;], which sought to simplify the Turkish language, and wrote articles for the &quot;Servet-i Fünun&quot; magazine using a literary style comprehensible only to the most learned of Ottoman intellectuals. Fuat Köprülü changed his writing style and politics during the Balkan Wars. On February 6, 1913, the day after the Bulgarian army attacked the Ottoman lines in the outskirts of Istanbul, &quot;Türk Yurdu&quot; magazine, a bastion of simplified Turkish prose and Turkish nationalism, published the first of many popular and patriotic essays by the 23-year-old Fuat Köprülü: “Hope and Determination&quot; (&quot;Umit ve Azim&quot;), “Mourning Migration (&quot;Hicret Matemleri&quot;), &quot;A Turk&#x27;s Prayer (&quot;Türk’ün Duasi&quot;), and “Turkishness, Islamness, Ottomanness&quot; (&quot;Türklük, İslamlık, Osmanlılık&quot;). He published articles in &quot;İslam Mecmuası&quot;, one of the publications of the Committee of Union and Progress, between 1914 and 1918. From 1919 to 1920 he contributed to &quot;Büyük Mecmua&quot;, a supporter of the Turkish War of Independence.

Toward the end of 1913, Fuat Köprülü published his seminal and widely lauded academic article, “The Method in Turkish Literary History (&quot;Türk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul&quot;), in &quot;Bilgi Mecmuasi&quot;. He argued that historians should not only research kings, viziers, commanders and scholars, but ordinary people as well. Fuat Köprülü believed that in addition to public and official records, historians should also study art, archeology, literature, language, folklore and oral traditions. His plea for historians to study social history was so unique and ahead of its time that the &quot;Annales&quot; school in France, famous for embracing a similar approach in the journal &quot;Annales d’histoire economique et sociale&quot;, did not emerge until 1929, a full 16 years after the publication of &quot;Turk Edebiyati Tarihinde Usul&quot;. One month after the publication of the article, Fuat Köprülü was appointed Professor of the history of Turkish literature at Darülfunün. He was only 23 years old.

Fuat Köprülü continued his scholarly research and academic publications through the years, eventually culminating in his magnum opus, &quot;The First Mystics in Turkish Literature&quot; (Turk Edebiyatinda İlk Mutasavviflar), in 1918, a book that focused on two Turkish mystics and folk poets, Ahmet Yesevi and Yunus Emre. His &quot;Turk Edebiyati Tarihi&quot; (History of Turkish Literature), published in 1920, was another seminal book that traced the history of Turkish literature through millennia. In 1923, at the age of 33, Fuat Köprülü was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Literature at Istanbul University. In a short book entitled &quot;The History of Turkey&quot; (&quot;Türkiye Tarihi&quot;) published that same year, he reviewed the history of the Turks from ancient Central Asia to the modern Ottoman Empire, continuing the approach he pioneered in his study of Turkish literature.

===Relationship with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk===
Fuat Köprülü was appointed undersecretary to the minister of education at the request of President Atatürk and remained in this post for eight months. In addition, Fuat Köprülü was appointed the director of the Turcology Institute, established on the orders of President Atatürk, and began publishing &quot;Turkiyat Mecmuasi&quot; (The Turcology Journal).

In 1936 Köprülü was appointed editor-in-chief of &quot;Ülkü&quot;, an official periodical of the Ankara People House, one of the cultural institutions established by Atatürk in 1932, a position which he held until 1941.

=== International Recognition ===

Fuat Köprülü won numerous international accolades for his scholarship as well. The Soviet Academy of Sciences granted him a corresponding membership in 1925. The University of Heidelberg honored him with an honorary degree in 1927. The University of Athens and the University of Paris (Sorbonne) granted him honorary doctorates in 1937 and 1939, respectively. In fact, most European Oriental societies made him a corresponding or honorary member, as did the American Oriental Society in 1947.

In 1933, Fuat Köprülü became a professor ordinarius, a title denoting a professor of the highest rank in Turkey. In 1935, he delivered a series of influential lectures at the University of Paris (Sorbonne) on the origins of the Ottoman Empire. Fuat Köprülü argued that ethnic Turks formed the Ottoman Empire using Seljuk and Ilhanid administrative traditions, and he discredited the prevailing view among Western scholars that the Ottoman Empire was formed by a race of predominantly Albanian, Eastern Roman and Slavic converts to Islam.

=== Later Political Life ===
In 1935, at the request of President Atatürk, Fuat Köprülü joined the single party regime in the Turkish Parliament as a Kars deputy, and was elected again in 1939 and 1943. In 1945, as calls to establish a multiparty democracy increased after World War II, Fuat Köprülü joined the opposition and was dismissed from the ruling party along with Adnan Menderes and Refik Koraltan. In 1946, Menderes, Koraltan and Köprülü, together with Celal Bayar, formed the Democrat Party. Fuat Köprülü became the Minister of Foreign Affairs when the Democrat Party came to power in the 1950 elections, and he served in this post until 1955. In 1953, an agreement was reached between Yugoslav President Tito and Fuat Köprülü that promoted the emigration of Albanians from Yugoslavia to Anatolia. Concerning Cyprus, he had a tolerant view of the dispute and supported the line of the Turkish government, that the status quo of a British government on the island was favorable. Fuat Köprülü also briefly served as Deputy Prime Minister in 1955. On September 6, 1957, Fuat Köprülü resigned from the Democrat Party after disagreeing with the authoritarian tendencies displayed by the party leadership; the same year he joined Liberty Party. Following the coup d&#x27;état in 1960 he was tried at the Yassıada trials but found not guilty.

== Death ==
Fuat Köprülü died on 28 June 1966.

==Works==
A prolific scholar and public intellectual, Fuat Köprülü wrote over 1500 poems, essays, articles and books. A &quot;Mehmet Fuat Koprulu Scholarship Programme&quot; was recently established to provide funds for Turkish students to undertake PhD study at the University of Cambridge.

<doc id="181229" wikidata="Q110354" url="?curid=181229" title="The Great Escape (film)">
<text>The Great Escape is a 1963 American epic historical war adventure film starring Steve McQueen, James Garner and Richard Attenborough and featuring James Donald, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Coburn, Hannes Messemer, David McCallum, Gordon Jackson, John Leyton and Angus Lennie. It was filmed in Panavision, and its musical score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. Adapted from Paul Brickhill&#x27;s 1950 non-fiction book of the same name, the film depicts a heavily fictionalized version of the mass escape by British Commonwealth prisoners of war from German POW camp Stalag Luft III in World War II. The film made numerous compromises for its commercial appeal, including its portrayal of American involvement in the escape.

&quot;The Great Escape&quot; was made by The Mirisch Company, released by United Artists, and produced and directed by John Sturges. The film had its Royal World Premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London&#x27;s West End on 20 June 1963. &quot;The Great Escape&quot; received critical acclaim and emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the year, winning McQueen the award for Best Actor at the Moscow International Film Festival, and is considered a classic. The film is also noted for its motorcycle chase and jump scene, which is considered one of the best stunts ever performed.

==Plot==
During World War II, Allied POWs who have repeatedly escaped from camps in Germany are moved to a new camp under the command of Luftwaffe Colonel von Luger. He warns British Group Captain Ramsey—the highest-ranked POW officer—that any man who escapes will be shot. Regardless, several POWs attempt to escape on the first day, but none succeed. Hilts, a notoriously prolific escapee, finds a blind spot at the fence and purposefully gets caught so his discovery is unnoticed. He is placed in a cell next to Ives in &quot;the cooler&quot;, and the two become friends.

RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett re-establishes &quot;the X Organisation&quot;, an escape-planning committee from their former camp, with Ramsey&#x27;s tacit approval. He proposes breaking out an unprecedented 250 men, thereby forcing the Germans to divert significant manpower away from the front. The POWs begin working on three tunnels: &quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;Dick&quot;, and &quot;Harry&quot;.

Each POW contributes to the plan: Welinski and Dickes oversee the digging, Sedgwick makes picks and air bellows, Ashley-Pitt hides the excavated dirt, while Cavendish surveys the tunnels’ routes and leads a choir to mask the digging noise. MacDonald gathers intelligence, Griffith sews civilian disguises, Blythe forges documents, and Hendley secures supplies on the black market. Aware that Hilts is planning his own escape, Bartlett asks him to allow himself to be recaptured so he can draw maps of the surrounding area for the X Organisation; Hilts refuses out of pride.

When &quot;Tom&quot; nears completion first, Bartlett orders &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Harry&quot; sealed off. Hilts, Hendley, and Goff brew potato moonshine and celebrate the Fourth of July with the camp, but to the men&#x27;s dismay the guards find &quot;Tom&quot; during the party. Ives snaps, climbs the fence, and is shot dead. Hilts, shaken, agrees to Bartlett&#x27;s proposal, and Bartlett orders &quot;Harry&quot; reopened.

When the tunnel partially collapses, Welinski reveals to Dickes that he is claustrophobic—he tries to climb the fence in panic, but Dickes calms him down before he is shot. Blythe is forced into admitting that he is going blind due to progressive myopia, but Hendley offers to be his eyes during the escape.

The POWs complete &quot;Harry&quot;, but on the night they break to the surface they find themselves short of the woods. Helped by Hilts tugging on a rope as a signal that the coast is clear—and aided by a fortuitous air raid blackout—dozens of men flee before Cavendish slips and makes a noise. An impatient Griffith surfaces while a guard investigates and is captured, ending the breakout.

The 76 escapees flee throughout Europe, but only three successfully make it to freedom: Welinski and Dickes take a boat and board a ship for Sweden, while Sedgwick heads to France, where the Resistance smuggles him to Spain. The rest are unsuccessful: Cavendish hitches a ride on a truck, but is turned in by the driver. Hendley and Blythe steal a plane to fly to Switzerland, but crash when the engine fails; Blythe is shot and Hendley is recaptured. Hilts steals a motorcycle and heads for the Swiss border, chased by soldiers, who shoot his bike and recapture him. At a railway station, Ashley-Pitt sacrifices himself when he kills a Gestapo officer before he can recognise Bartlett. However, Bartlett and MacDonald are still arrested after a Gestapo officer tricks MacDonald into speaking English while boarding a bus.

Most of the men—including Bartlett, MacDonald, and Cavendish—are driven to a field and shot dead, bringing the total deaths to 50. Ramsey informs the returning survivors of the murders, and says that Bartlett&#x27;s plan to &quot;gum up the works&quot; with the escape was a success; Hendley questions whether it was worth the price. Von Luger is relieved of command and driven away by the Gestapo, while Hilts is sent to the cooler, where he begins planning his next escape.

==Production==
===Writing===
In 1963, the Mirisch brothers worked with United Artists to adapt Paul Brickhill&#x27;s 1950 book &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. Brickhill had been a very minor member of the X Organisation at Stalag Luft III, who acted as one of the &quot;stooges&quot; who monitored German movements in the camp. The story had been adapted as a live TV production, screened by NBC as an episode of &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot; on January 27, 1951. The live broadcast was praised for engineering an ingenious set design for the live broadcast, including creating the illusion of tunnels. The film&#x27;s screenplay was adapted by James Clavell, W. R. Burnett and Walter Newman.

===Casting===
Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn had previously worked with director John Sturges on his 1960 motion picture, &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. Steve McQueen has been credited with the most significant performance. Critic Leonard Maltin wrote that &quot;the large, international cast is superb, but the standout is McQueen; it&#x27;s easy to see why this cemented his status as a superstar&quot;. This film established his box-office clout. Hilts was based on at least three pilots, David M. Jones, John Dortch Lewis and Bill Ash.

Richard Attenborough&#x27;s Sqn Ldr Roger Bartlett RAF, &quot;Big X&quot;, was based on Roger Bushell, the South African-born British POW who was the mastermind of the real Great Escape. This was the film that first brought Attenborough to common notice in the United States. During World War II, Attenborough served in the Royal Air Force. He volunteered to fly with the Film Unit, and after further training (where he sustained permanent ear damage), he qualified as a sergeant. He flew on several missions over Europe, filming from the rear gunner&#x27;s position to record the outcome of Bomber Command sorties. (Richard Harris was originally announced for the role.)

Group Captain Ramsey RAF, &quot;the SBO&quot; (Senior British Officer), was based on Group Captain Herbert Massey, a World War I veteran who had volunteered in World War II. Massey walked with a limp, and in the movie Ramsey walks with a cane. Massey had suffered severe wounds to the same leg in both wars. There would be no escape for him, but as SBO he had to know what was going on. Group Captain Massey was a veteran escaper himself and had been in trouble with the Gestapo. His experience allowed him to offer sound advice to the X-Organisation. Another officer who is likely to have inspired the character of Ramsey was Wing Commander Harry Day.

Flt Lt Colin Blythe RAF, &quot;The Forger&quot;, was based on Tim Walenn and played by Donald Pleasence. Pleasence had served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. He was shot down and spent a year in German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft I. Charles Bronson had been a gunner in the USAAF and had been wounded, but never shot down. Like his character, Danny Welinski, he suffered from claustrophobia because of his childhood work in a mine. James Garner had been a soldier in the Korean War and was twice wounded. He was a scrounger during that time, as is his character.

Hannes Messemer&#x27;s Commandant, &quot;Colonel von Luger&quot;, was based on Oberst Friedrich Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau. Messemer had been a POW in Russia during World War II and had escaped by walking hundreds of miles to the German border. He was wounded by Russian fire, but was not captured by the Russians. He surrendered to British forces and then spent two years in a POW facility in London known as the London Cage.

Angus Lennie&#x27;s Flying Officer Archibald Ives, &quot;The Mole&quot;, was based on Jimmy Kiddel, who was shot dead while trying to scale the fence.

The film is accurate in showing only three escapees made home runs, although the people who made them differed from those in the film. The escape of Danny and Willie to Sweden is based on two Norwegians, Per Bergsland and Jens Müller, while the escape of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Flying Officer Sedgwick, &quot;the Manufacturer&quot;, to Spain, was based on Dutchman Bram van der Stok. James Coburn, an American, was cast in the role of Sedgwick who was an amalgamation of Flt Lt Albert Hake, an Australian serving in the RAF, the camp&#x27;s compass maker, and Johnny Travis, the real manufacturer. &quot;Filmink&quot; wrote that &quot;if he didn’t crack the accent, Coburn nails the attitude&quot; of an Australian.

Tilman &#x27;Til Kiwe&#x27; Kiver played the German guard &quot;Frick&quot;, who discovers the escape. Kiwe had been a German paratrooper officer who was captured and held prisoner at a POW camp in Colorado. He made several escape attempts, dyeing his uniform and carrying forged papers. He was captured in the St. Louis train station during one escape attempt. He won the Knight&#x27;s Cross before his capture and was the cast member who had actually performed many of the exploits shown in the film.

===Filming===
The film was made on location in Germany at the Bavaria Film Studio in the Munich suburb of Geiselgasteig in rural Bavaria, where sets for the barrack interiors and tunnels were constructed. The camp was built in a clearing of the Perlacher Forst (Perlacher Forest) near the studio. The German town near the real camp was Sagan (now Żagań, Poland); it was renamed Neustadt in the film. Many scenes were filmed in and around the town of Füssen in Bavaria, including its railway station. The nearby district of Pfronten, with its distinctive St. Nikolaus Church and scenic background, also appears often in the film. The first scenes involving the railway were filmed on the Munich–Holzkirchen line at Großhesselohe station (&quot;Neustadt&quot; station in the movie) and near Deisenhofen. Hendley and Blythe&#x27;s escape from the train was shot on the Munich–Mühldorf railway east of Markt Schwaben. The station where Bartlett, MacDonald and Ashley-Pitt arrive is Füssen station, whereas the scene of Sedgwick (whose theft of a bike was shot in Markt Schwaben) boarding a train was created in Pfronten-Ried station on the Ausserfern Railway. The castle Hendley and Blythe fly by while attempting to escape is Neuschwanstein Castle.
The motorcycle chase scenes with the barbed wire fences were shot on meadows outside Füssen, and the &quot;barbed wire&quot; that Hilts crashes into before being recaptured was simulated by strips of rubber tied around barbless wire, constructed by the cast and crew in their spare time. Insurance concerns prevented McQueen from performing the film&#x27;s notable motorcycle leap, which was done by his friend and fellow cycle enthusiast Bud Ekins, who resembled McQueen from a distance. When Johnny Carson later tried to congratulate McQueen for the jump during a broadcast of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, McQueen said, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t me. That was Bud Ekins.&quot; However, McQueen and Australian Motocross champion Tim Gibbes both performed the stunt on camera for fun, and according to second unit director Robert Relyea, the stunt in the final cut of the movie could have been performed by any of the three men. Other parts of the chase were done by McQueen, playing both Hilts and the soldiers chasing him, because of his skill on a motorcycle. The motorcycle was a Triumph TR6 Trophy which was painted to look like a German machine. The restored machine is currently on display at Triumph&#x27;s factory at Hinckley, England. Filming started on June 4, 1962 and ended in October 1962.

==Historical accuracy==
The film accurately represented many details of the escape, including the layout of the camp, the different escape plans employed, and the fact that only three escapees successfully made it to freedom. The characters are fictitious, but are based on real men, in most cases being composites of several. However, a number of changes were made to increase the film&#x27;s drama and appeal to an American audience, with some scenes being heavily or completely fictionalised. The screenwriters also significantly increased the involvement of American POWs in the escape. A few American officers in the camp initially helped dig the tunnels and worked on the early plans, but they were moved away seven months before the escape, which ended their involvement. The real escape was by largely British and other Allied personnel, with the exception of American Johnnie Dodge, who was a British officer. The film omits the crucial role that Canadians played in building the tunnels and in the escape itself. Of the 1,800 or so POWs, 600 were involved in preparations: 150 of those were Canadian. Wally Floody, an RCAF pilot and former miner who was the real-life &quot;tunnel king&quot;, was engaged as a technical advisor for the film.

Ramsey tells Von Luger that it is the sworn duty of every officer to attempt escape. In reality, there was no requirement in the King&#x27;s Regulations, or in any form of international convention.

The film shows the tunnel codenamed &quot;Tom&quot; with its entrance under a stove and &quot;Harry&quot; in a drain sump in a washroom. In reality, the entrance to &quot;Dick&quot; was the drain sump, &quot;Harry&quot; was under the stove, and &quot;Tom&quot; was in a darkened corner next to a stove chimney.

Former POWs asked the filmmakers to exclude details about the help they received from their home countries, such as maps, papers, and tools hidden in gift packages, lest it jeopardise future POW escapes. The filmmakers complied.

The film omits any mention that many Germans willingly helped in the escape itself. The film suggests that the forgers were able to make near-exact replicas of just about any pass that was used in Nazi Germany. In reality, the forgers received a great deal of assistance from Germans who lived many hundreds of miles away on the other side of the country. Several German guards, who were openly anti-Nazi, also willingly gave the prisoners items and assistance of any kind to aid their escape. The need for such accuracy produced much eyestrain, but unlike in the film, there were no cases of blindness. Some, such as Frank Knight, gave up forging because of the strain, but he certainly did not suffer the same ocular fate as the character of Colin Blythe in the film. In fact, no one in the film says that Colin Blythe&#x27;s blindness is the result of eyestrain. He identifies his problem as &quot;progressive myopia&quot;, suggesting that he has not only heard of the condition but has also been diagnosed.

The film depicts the escape taking place in ideal weather conditions, whereas at the time much was done in freezing temperatures, and snow lay thick on the ground. In reality there were no escapes by aircraft or motorcycle: McQueen requested the motorcycle sequence, which shows off his skills as a keen motorcyclist. He did the stunt riding himself (except for the final jump, done by Bud Ekins).

In the film, Hilts incapacitates a German soldier for his motorcycle, Ashley-Pitt kills Kuhn, a Gestapo officer, when he recognizes Bartlett at a Gestapo checkpoint at a railway station and is shot dead in return. Hendley knocks out a German guard at the airfield. Sedgwick witnesses the killing of German officers at a French Cafe by the French resistance. No German personnel were killed or injured by the real escapees. Blythe is shot and mortally wounded by a German after their plane crashes just short of the border; this incident never happened. Three truckloads of recaptured POWs drive in three directions. One truck contains 20 prisoners who are invited to stretch their legs in a field, whereupon they are all machine gunned in a single massacre, with the implication that the other two were killed in the same manner; in reality, the POWs were shot individually or in pairs. The majority of the POWs were killed by pistol shots taken by Gestapo officers; however, at least ten of them were killed in a manner like that portrayed in the film: Dutchy Swain, Chaz Hall, Brian Evans, Wally Valenta, George McGill, Pat Langford, Edgar Humphreys, Adam Kolanowski, Bob Stewart and Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Birkland. The film depicts the three prisoners who escape to freedom as British, Polish, and Australian; in reality, they were Norwegian (Jens Müller and Per Bergsland) and Dutch (Bram van der Stok).

In 2009, seven POWs returned to Stalag Luft III for the 65th anniversary of the escape and watched the film. According to the veterans, many details of the first half depicting life in the camp were authentic, e.g. the death of Ives, who tries to scale the fence, and the actual digging of the tunnels. The film has kept the memory of the 50 executed airmen alive for decades and has made their story known worldwide, if in a distorted form. British author Guy Walters notes that a pivotal scene in the film where MacDonald blunders by replying in English to a suspicious Gestapo officer saying, &quot;Good luck&quot;, is now so strongly imprinted that historians have accepted it as a real event, and that it was Bushell&#x27;s partner Bernard Scheidhauer who made the error. However, Walters points out that a historical account says that one of the two men said &quot;yes&quot; in English in response to a Kripo man&#x27;s questions without any mention of &quot;good luck&quot; and notes that as Scheidhauser was French, and Bushell&#x27;s first language was English, it seems likely that if a slip did take place, it was made by Bushell himself, and says the &quot;good luck&quot; scene should be regarded as fiction.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s iconic music was composed by Elmer Bernstein, who gave each major character his own musical motif based on the &quot;Great Escape&quot;″s main theme. Its enduring popularity helped Bernstein live off the score&#x27;s royalties for the rest of his life. Critics have said the film score succeeds because it uses rousing militaristic motifs with interludes of warmer softer themes that humanizes the prisoners and endears them to audiences; the music also captures the bravery and defiance of the POWs. The main title&#x27;s patriotic march has since become popular in Britain, particularly with fans of the England national football team. However, in 2016, the sons of Elmer Bernstein openly criticized the use of the &quot;Great Escape&quot; theme by the Vote Leave campaign in the UK Brexit referendum, saying &quot;Our father would never have allowed UKIP to use his music&quot; because he would have strongly opposed the party.

;Intrada Records (release)
In 2011 Intrada, a company specializing in film soundtracks, released a digitized re-mastered version of the full film score based on the original 1/4&quot; two-track stereo sessions and original 1/2&quot; three-channel stereo masters.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Great Escape&quot; grossed $11.7 million at the box office, after a budget of $4 million. It became one of the highest-grossing films of 1963, despite heavy competition. In the years since its release, its audience has broadened, cementing its status as a cinema classic. It was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival, where McQueen won the Silver Prize for Best Actor.

===Critical response===
Contemporary reviews for the film were mostly positive. In 1963, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;But for much longer than is artful or essential, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; grinds out its tormenting story without a peek beneath the surface of any man, without a real sense of human involvement. It&#x27;s a strictly mechanical adventure with make-believe men.&quot; British film critic Leslie Halliwell described it as &quot;pretty good but overlong POW adventure with a tragic ending&quot;. The &quot;Time&quot; magazine reviewer wrote in 1963: &quot;The use of color photography is unnecessary and jarring, but little else is wrong with this film. With accurate casting, a swift screenplay, and authentic German settings, Producer-Director John Sturges has created classic cinema of action. There is no sermonizing, no soul probing, no sex. &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is simply great escapism&quot;.

===Accolades===

==Sequel==
A fictional, made-for-television sequel, &quot;The Great Escape II: The Untold Story&quot;, was released in 1988, starring Christopher Reeve, and directed by Jud Taylor (who played Goff in the original film). The film is not a true sequel, dramatizing the escape itself just as the first film does, but mostly using the real names of the individuals involved (whereas the original film fictionalized them with composite characters). It depicts the hunt for those responsible for the murder of the 50 Allied airmen. Donald Pleasence appears in a supporting role as a member of the SS.

==Legacy==
On 24 March 2014, the 70th anniversary of the escape, the RAF staged a commemoration of the escape attempt, with 50 serving personnel each carrying a photograph of one of the shot men.

On 24 March 2019, the RAF held another event for the 75th anniversary of the escape. There was a screening of the film at London&#x27;s Eventim Hammersmith Apollo, hosted by Dan Snow. The film was simulcast with other cinemas throughout the UK.

===Modern appraisals===
&quot;The Great Escape&quot; continues to receive acclaim from modern critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on 53 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;With its impeccably slow-building story and a cast for the ages, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is an all-time action classic.&quot;

In a 2006 poll in the United Kingdom, regarding the family film that television viewers would most want to see on Christmas Day, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; came in third, and was first among the choices of male viewers. In an article for the British Film Institute, &quot;10 great prisoner of war films&quot;, updated in August 2018, Samuel Wigley wrote that watching films like &quot;The Great Escape&quot; and the 1955 British film &quot;The Colditz Story&quot;, &quot;for all their moments of terror and tragedy, is to delight in captivity in times of war as a wonderful game for boys, an endless Houdini challenge to slip through the enemy&#x27;s fingers. Often based on true stories of escape, they have the viewer marvelling at the ingenuity and seemingly unbreakable spirit of imprisoned soldiers.&quot; He described &quot;The Great Escape&quot; as &quot;the epitome of the war-is-fun action film&quot;, which became &quot;a fixture of family TV viewing&quot;.

=== In popular culture ===

* &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1986) was released for the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and DOS platforms, and shares a title and similar plot to the film. The game follows an unnamed prisoner of war who has been interned in a POW camp somewhere in northern Germany in 1942.

<text>Juan Atkins (born September 12, 1962), also known as Model 500 and Infiniti, is an American record producer and DJ from Detroit, Michigan. &quot;Mixmag&quot; has described him as &quot;the original pioneer of Detroit techno.&quot; He has been a member of the Belleville Three, Cybotron, and Borderland.

==Early life==
Juan Atkins was born in Detroit, Michigan. His father is a concert promoter. At an early age, he played guitar and bass guitar in funk/garage bands with his friends. After his parents split, he moved to Belleville, Michigan. In junior high school, he met Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson. The three would later be known as the Belleville Three. At the age of 15, he bought his first synthesizer, a Korg MS-10.

==Career==
Juan Atkins formed Cybotron with Richard Davis in 1980. The duo&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Enter&quot;, was released in 1983. Atkins and Davis split ways in 1985.

In 1985, Atkins founded the record label Metroplex. In that year, he started making solo records under the alias Model 500. As Model 500, he released &quot;Deep Space&quot; in 1995, &quot;Mind and Body&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Digital Solutions&quot; in 2015.

He is also one half of the duo Borderland along with Moritz von Oswald. The duo released &quot;Borderland&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Transport&quot; in 2016.

In 2015, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Metroplex, Juan Atkins collaborated with VAVA Eyewear.

==Style and influences==
Juan Atkins has stated that George Clinton&#x27;s bands Parliament and Funkadelic were important to his musical awakening. He grew up listening to The Electrifying Mojo&#x27;s radio shows. He also acknowledged Kraftwerk as one of the influences on his music. &quot;Mixmag&quot; has described him as &quot;the original pioneer of Detroit techno.&quot; Stylistically, he drew upon dystopian science fiction narratives to construct his sonic landscapes.

<doc id="181234" wikidata="Q617263" url="?curid=181234" title="Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814">
<text>The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814 (also known as the Convention of London; ) was signed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands in London on 13 August 1814.

The treaty restored most of the territories in the Moluccas and Java that Britain had seized in the Napoleonic Wars, but confirmed British possession of the Cape Colony on the southern tip of Africa, as well as portions of Dutch Guiana in South America. It was signed by Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, on behalf of the British and diplomat Hendrik Fagel, on behalf of the Dutch.

The British only left Java and Sumatra in 1821, at which point the Dutch soon became entangled in colonial wars in Java.
== Terms ==

=== Possessions ===
The treaty returned the colonial possessions of the Dutch as they were at 1 January 1803, before the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars in the Americas, Africa, and Asia, with the exception of the Cape of Good Hope and the South American settlements of Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice, where the Dutch retained trading rights.

In addition, the British ceded the island of Banca off the island of Sumatra in exchange for the settlement of Cochin in India and its dependencies on the coast of Malabar. The Dutch also ceded the district of Bernagore, situated close to Calcutta, in exchange for an annual fee.

=== Cooperation ===
The treaty also noted a declaration of 15 June 1814 by the Dutch, that ships for the slave trade were no longer permitted in British ports. That restriction would be extended to a ban on involvement in the slave trade by Dutch citizens. Britain also agreed to pay £1,000,000 to Sweden to resolve a claim to the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe.

The British and the Dutch agreed to spend £2,000,000 each on improving the defences of the Low Countries. More funds, of up to £3,000,000, are mentioned for the &quot;final and satisfactory settlement of the Low Countries in union with Holland.&quot;

Disputes arising from the treaty were the subject of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824.
