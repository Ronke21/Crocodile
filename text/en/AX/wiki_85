<text>Integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN) is a mobile telecommunications technology, developed by Motorola, which provides its users the benefits of a trunked radio and a cellular telephone. It was called the first mobile social network by many technology industry analysts. iDEN places more users in a given spectral space, compared to analog cellular and two-way radio systems, by using speech compression and time-division multiple access (TDMA).

== History ==
The iDEN project originally began as MIRS (Motorola Integrated Radio System) in early 1991. The project was a software lab experiment focused on the utilization of discontiguous spectrum for GSM wireless. GSM systems typically require 24 contiguous voice channels, but the original MIRS software platform dynamically selected fragmented channels in the radio frequency (RF) spectrum in such a way that a GSM telecom switch could commence a phone call the same as it would in the contiguous channel scenario.

== Operating frequencies ==
iDEN is designed and licensed to operate on individual frequencies that may not be contiguous. iDEN operates on 25 kHz channels, but only occupies 20 kHz in order to provide interference protection via guard bands. By comparison, TDMA Cellular (Digital AMPS) is licensed in blocks of 30 kHz channels, but each emission occupies 40 kHz, and is capable of serving the same number of subscribers per channel as iDEN. iDEN uses frequency-division duplexing to transmit and receive signals separately, with transmit and receive bands separated by 39 MHz, 45 MHz, or 48 MHz depending on the frequency band being used.

iDEN supports either three or six interconnect users (phone users) per channel, and six dispatch users (push-to-talk users) per channel, using time-division multiple access. The transmit and receive time slots assigned to each user are deliberately offset in time so that a single user never needs to transmit and receive at the same time. This eliminates the need for a duplexer at the mobile end, since time-division duplexing of RF section usage can be performed.

== Hardware ==

The first commercial iDEN handset was Motorola&#x27;s L3000, which was released in 1994. Lingo, which stands for Link People on the Go, was used as a logo for its earlier handsets. Most modern iDEN handsets use SIM cards, similar to, but incompatible with GSM handsets&#x27; SIM cards. Early iDEN models such as the i1000plus stored all subscriber information inside the handset itself, requiring the data to be downloaded and transferred should the subscriber want to switch handsets. Newer handsets using SIM technology make upgrading or changing handsets as easy as swapping the SIM card. Four different sized SIM cards exist, &quot;Endeavor&quot; SIMs are used only with the i2000 without data, &quot;Condor&quot; SIMs are used with the two-digit models (i95cl, for example) using a SIM with less memory than the three-digit models (i730, i860), &quot;Falcon&quot; SIMs are used in the three-digit phones, (i530, i710) and will read the smaller SIM for backward compatibility, but some advanced features such as extra contact information is not supported by the older SIM cards. There is also the &quot;Falcon 128&quot; SIM, which is the same as the original &quot;Falcon&quot;, but doubled in memory size, which is used on new 3 digit phones (i560, i930).

The interconnect-side of the iDEN network uses GSM signalling for call set-up and mobility management, with the Abis protocol stack modified to support iDEN&#x27;s additional features. Motorola has named this modified stack &#x27;Mobis&#x27;.

Each base site requires precise timing and location information to synchronize data across the network. To obtain and maintain this information each base site uses GPS satellites to receive a precise timing reference .

== WiDEN ==
Wideband Integrated Digital Enhanced Network, or WiDEN, is a software upgrade developed by Motorola and partners for its iDEN enhanced specialized mobile radio (or ESMR) wireless telephony protocol. WiDEN allows compatible subscriber units to communicate across four 25 kHz channels combined, for up to 100 kbit/s of bandwidth. The protocol is generally considered a 2.5G wireless cellular technology.

=== History ===
iDEN, the platform which WiDEN upgrades, and the protocol on which it is based, was originally introduced by Motorola in 1993, and launched as a commercial network by Nextel in the United States in September 1996.

WiDEN was originally anticipated to be a major stepping stone for United States wireless telephone provider Nextel Communications and its affiliate, Nextel Partners. However, beginning with the December 2004 announcement of the Sprint Nextel merger, Nextel&#x27;s iDEN network was abandoned in favor of Sprint&#x27;s CDMA network. WiDEN was deactivated on the NEXTEL National Network in October 2005 when rebanding efforts in the 800 MHz band began in an effort to utilize those data channels as a way to handle more cellular phone call traffic on the NEXTEL iDEN network. The original Nextel iDEN network was finally decommissioned by Sprint on June 30, 2013 and the spectrum refarmed for use in the Sprint LTE network.

=== Subscriber Units ===

The first WiDEN-compatible device to be released was the Motorola iM240 PC card which allows raw data speeds up to 60 kbit/s. The first WiDEN-compatible telephones are the Motorola i850 and i760, which were released mid-summer 2005. The recent i850/i760 Software Upgrade enables WiDEN on both of these phones. The commercial launch of WiDEN came with the release of the Motorola i870 on 31 October 2005, however, most people never got to experience the WiDEN capability in their handsets. WiDEN is also offered in the i930/i920 Smartphone, however, Sprint shipped these units with WiDEN service disabled. Many in the cellular forum communities have found ways using Motorola&#x27;s own RSS software to activate it. WiDEN was available in most places on Nextel&#x27;s National Network. As stated above, it no longer is enabled on the Sprint-controlled towers. Since the Sprint Nextel merger the company determined that because Sprint&#x27;s CDMA network was already 3G and going to EVDO (broadband speeds), and then EVDO Rev A, it would be redundant to keep upgrading the iDEN data network. WiDEN is considered a 2.5G technology.

== Operators ==
Countries which had iDEN networks included United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Chile, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, India, Korea, Jordan, Guam, China, Philippines, Thailand, Israel, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, El Salvador, and Guatemala.

* Sprint Nextel provided iDEN service across the United States until its iDEN network was decommissioned for additional LTE network capacity on 30 June 2013.
*SouthernLINC Wireless provided iDEN service across the United States until its iDEN network was decommissioned for additional LTE network capacity on 1 April 2019.
* Telus provided iDEN service under the Mike brand across most of Canada until its iDEN network was decommissioned on 29 January 2016.
* Nextel Brazil provided iDEN service in Brazil until its iDEN network was decommissioned on 31 March 2018.
*Nextel Argentina also provided iDEN service until decommissioning on 30 June 2019.
*Colombian Avantel deactivated its iDEN service at the end of 2021.
* Nextel Mexico provided iDEN service in Mexico until its iDEN network was decommissioned in 2017. The Mexican Nextel assets were purchased by AT&amp;T in 2015 along with Iusacell the same year to form the nucleus and the revival of AT&amp;T Mexico. AT&amp;T gradually transitioned users from the previous CDMA and iDEN networks to AWS 3G and 4G LTE networks beginning in 2017.

== Capitalization and pronunciation ==
Motorola originally referred to the platform as wiDEN, choosing to capitalize only the letters representing &quot;Digital Enhanced Network,&quot; as it had with iDEN. However, subsequent promotion from Motorola and Nextel has indicated that the preferred capitalization is WiDEN.

The term has been pronounced, commonly, as a close combination to the words &quot;why&quot; and &quot;den&quot;, or simply as the word &quot;widen&quot;. The former is closer to the original pronunciation of iDEN, as &quot;eye&quot; and &quot;den&quot;.

<text>In chemistry, a reagent ( ) or analytical reagent is a substance or compound added to a system to cause a chemical reaction, or test if one occurs. The terms &quot;reactant&quot; and &quot;reagent&quot; are often used interchangeably, but reactant specifies a substance &quot;consumed&quot; in the course of a chemical reaction. &quot;Solvents&quot;, though involved in the reaction mechanism, are usually not called reactants. Similarly, &quot;catalysts&quot; are not consumed by the reaction, so they are not reactants. In biochemistry, especially in connection with enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the reactants are commonly called substrates.

==Definitions==

=== Organic chemistry ===
In organic chemistry, the term &quot;reagent&quot; denotes a chemical ingredient (a compound or mixture, typically of inorganic or small organic molecules) introduced to cause the desired transformation of an organic substance. Examples include the Collins reagent, Fenton&#x27;s reagent, and Grignard reagents.

=== Analytical chemistry ===
In analytical chemistry, a reagent is a compound or mixture used to detect the presence or absence of another substance, e.g. by a color change, or to measure the concentration of a substance, e.g. by colorimetry. Examples include Fehling&#x27;s reagent, Millon&#x27;s reagent, and Tollens&#x27; reagent.

==Commercial or laboratory preparations==
In commercial or laboratory preparations, reagent-grade designates chemical substances meeting standards of purity that ensure the scientific precision and reliability of chemical analysis, chemical reactions or physical testing. Purity standards for reagents are set by organizations such as ASTM International or the American Chemical Society. For instance, reagent-quality water must have very low levels of impurities such as sodium and chloride ions, silica, and bacteria, as well as a very high electrical resistivity. Laboratory products which are &quot;less&quot; pure, but still useful and economical for undemanding work, may be designated as &quot;technical&quot;, &quot;practical&quot;, or &quot;crude&quot; grade to distinguish them from reagent versions.

==Biology==
In the field of biology, the biotechnology revolution in the 1980s grew from the development of reagents that could be used to identify and manipulate the chemical matter in and on cells. These reagents included antibodies (polyclonal and monoclonal), oligomers, all sorts of model organisms and immortalised cell lines, reagents and methods for molecular cloning and DNA replication, and many others.
===Tool compounds===
Tool compounds are an important class of reagent in biology. They are small molecules or biochemicals like siRNA or antibodies that are known to affect a given biomolecule—for example a drug target—but are unlikely to be useful as drugs themselves, and are often starting points in the drug discovery process. 

However, many natural substances are hits in almost any assay in which they are tested, and therefore not useful as tool compounds. Medicinal chemists class them instead as pan-assay interference compounds. One example is curcumin.

<doc id="184898" wikidata="Q918099" url="?curid=184898" title="Ramsey's theorem">
<text>In combinatorics, Ramsey&#x27;s theorem, in one of its graph-theoretic forms, states that one will find monochromatic cliques in any edge labelling (with colours) of a sufficiently large complete graph. To demonstrate the theorem for two colours (say, blue and red), let and be any two positive integers. Ramsey&#x27;s theorem states that there exists a least positive integer for which every blue-red edge colouring of the complete graph on vertices contains a blue clique on vertices or a red clique on vertices. (Here signifies an integer that depends on both and .)

Ramsey&#x27;s theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by Frank Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. In this application it is a question of the existence of &quot;monochromatic subsets&quot;, that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.

An extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours, , and any given integers , there is a number, , such that if the edges of a complete graph of order are coloured with different colours, then for some between 1 and , it must contain a complete subgraph of order whose edges are all colour . The special case above has (and and ).

== Examples ==
=== &quot;R&quot;(3, 3) = 6 ===

Suppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, . There are 5 edges incident to and so (by the pigeonhole principle) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. Without loss of generality we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, , to vertices, , and , are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, , , , are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red and we have an entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, &quot;any&quot; contains a monochromatic , and therefore . The popular version of this is called the theorem on friends and strangers.

An alternative proof works by double counting. It goes as follows: Count the number of ordered triples of vertices, , , , such that the edge, , is red and the edge, , is blue. Firstly, any given vertex will be the middle of either (all edges from the vertex are the same colour), (four are the same colour, one is the other colour), or (three are the same colour, two are the other colour) such triples. Therefore, there are at most such triples. Secondly, for any non-monochromatic triangle , there exist precisely two such triples. Therefore, there are at most 18 non-monochromatic triangles. Therefore, at least 2 of the 20 triangles in the are monochromatic.

Conversely, it is possible to 2-colour a without creating any monochromatic , showing that . The unique colouring is shown to the right. Thus .

The task of proving that was one of the problems of William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition in 1953, as well as in the Hungarian Math Olympiad in 1947.

=== A multicolour example: &quot;R&quot;(3, 3, 3) = 17 ===
A multicolour Ramsey number is a Ramsey number using 3 or more colours. There are (up to symmetries) only two non-trivial multicolour Ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known, namely and .

Suppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours, red, green and blue. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex . Consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex . This is called the red neighbourhood of . The red neighbourhood of cannot contain any red edges, since otherwise there would be a red triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that red edge and the vertex . Thus, the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of has edges coloured with only two colours, namely green and blue. Since , the red neighbourhood of can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the green and blue neighbourhoods of can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for itself, is in one of the red, green or blue neighbourhoods of , the entire complete graph can have at most vertices. Thus, we have .

To see that , it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles. It turns out that there are exactly two such colourings on , the so-called untwisted and twisted colourings. Both colourings are shown in the figures to the right, with the untwisted colouring on the left, and the twisted colouring on the right.

If we select any colour of either the untwisted or twisted colouring on , and consider the graph whose edges are precisely those edges that have the specified colour, we will get the Clebsch graph.

It is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on that avoid monochromatic triangles, which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on , respectively.

It is also known that there are exactly 115 edge colourings with 3 colours on that avoid monochromatic triangles, provided that we consider edge colourings that differ by a permutation of the colours as being the same.

== Proof ==
=== 2-colour case ===
The theorem for the 2-colour case can be proved by induction on . It is clear from the definition that for all , . This starts the induction. We prove that exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis and exist.

:&quot;Lemma 1.&quot; formula_1

&quot;Proof.&quot; Consider a complete graph on vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours. Pick a vertex from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets and , such that for every vertex , is in if edge is blue, and is in if is red. Because the graph has formula_2 vertices, it follows that either formula_3 or formula_4 In the former case, if has a red then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise has a blue and so formula_5 has a blue by the definition of . The latter case is analogous. Thus the claim is true and we have completed the proof for 2 colours.

In this 2-colour case, if and are both even, the induction inequality can be strengthened to:
:formula_6
&quot;Proof&quot;. Suppose and are both even. Let and consider a two-coloured graph of vertices. If is the degree of the -th vertex in the blue subgraph, then by the Handshaking lemma, formula_7 is even. Given that is odd, there must be an even . Assume without loss of generality that is even, and that and are the vertices incident to vertex 1 in the blue and red subgraphs, respectively. Then both formula_8 and formula_9 are even. By the Pigeonhole principle, either formula_10 or formula_11 Since formula_12 is even and is odd, the first inequality can be strengthened, so either formula_13 or formula_11 Suppose formula_15 Then either the subgraph has a red and the proof is complete, or it has a blue which along with vertex 1 makes a blue . The case formula_16 is treated similarly.

=== Case of more colours ===
&quot;Lemma 2.&quot; If , then formula_17

&quot;Proof.&quot; Consider a complete graph of formula_18 vertices and colour its edges with colours. Now &#x27;go colour-blind&#x27; and pretend that and are the same colour. Thus the graph is now -coloured. Due to the definition of formula_19 such a graph contains either a mono-chromatically coloured with colour for some or a -coloured in the &#x27;blurred colour&#x27;. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of we must have either a -monochrome or a -monochrome . In either case the proof is complete.

Lemma 1 implies that any is finite. The right hand side of the inequality in Lemma 2 expresses a Ramsey number for colours in terms of Ramsey numbers for fewer colours. Therefore, any is finite for any number of colours. This proves the theorem.

== Ramsey numbers ==

The numbers in Ramsey&#x27;s theorem (and their extensions to more than two colours) are known as Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number gives the solution to the party problem, which asks the minimum number of guests, , that must be invited so that at least will know each other or at least will not know each other. In the language of graph theory, the Ramsey number is the minimum number of vertices, , such that all undirected simple graphs of order , contain a clique of order , or an independent set of order . Ramsey&#x27;s theorem states that such a number exists for all and .

By symmetry, it is true that . An upper bound for can be extracted from the proof of the theorem, and other arguments give lower bounds. (The first exponential lower bound was obtained by Paul Erdős using the probabilistic method.) However, there is a vast gap between the tightest lower bounds and the tightest upper bounds. There are also very few numbers and for which we know the exact value of .

Computing a lower bound for usually requires exhibiting a blue/red colouring of the graph with no blue subgraph and no red subgraph. Such a counterexample is called a &quot;Ramsey graph&quot;. Brendan McKay maintains a list of known Ramsey graphs. Upper bounds are often considerably more difficult to establish: one either has to check all possible colourings to confirm the absence of a counterexample, or to present a mathematical argument for its absence.

=== Computational complexity ===
A sophisticated computer program does not need to look at all colourings individually in order to eliminate all of them; nevertheless it is a very difficult computational task that existing software can only manage on small sizes. Each complete graph has edges, so there would be a total of graphs to search through (for colours) if brute force is used. Therefore, the complexity for searching all possible graphs (via brute force) is for colourings and at most nodes.

The situation is unlikely to improve with the advent of quantum computers. One of the best-known searching algorithms for unstructured datasets exhibits only a quadratic speedup (cf. Grover&#x27;s algorithm) relative to classical computers, so that the computation time is still exponential in the number of nodes.

=== Known values ===

As described above, . It is easy to prove that , and, more generally, that for all : a graph on nodes with all edges coloured red serves as a counterexample and proves that ; among colourings of a graph on nodes, the colouring with all edges coloured red contains a -node red subgraph, and all other colourings contain a 2-node blue subgraph (that is, a pair of nodes connected with a blue edge.)

Using induction inequalities and the handshaking lemma, it can be concluded that , and therefore . There are only two graphs (that is, 2-colourings of a complete graph on 16 nodes without 4-node red or blue complete subgraphs) among different 2-colourings of 16-node graphs, and only one graph (the Paley graph of order 17) among colourings. It follows that .

The fact that was first established by Brendan McKay and Stanisław Radziszowski in 1995.

The exact value of is unknown, although it is known to lie between 43 (Geoffrey Exoo (1989)) and 46 (Angeltveit and McKay (2024)), inclusive.

In 1997, McKay, Radziszowski and Exoo employed computer-assisted graph generation methods to conjecture that . They were able to construct exactly 656 graphs, arriving at the same set of graphs through different routes. None of the 656 graphs can be extended to a graph.

For with , only weak bounds are available. Lower bounds for and have not been improved since 1965 and 1972, respectively.

 with are shown in the table below. Where the exact value is unknown, the table lists the best known bounds. with are given by and for all values of .

The standard survey on the development of Ramsey number research is the &quot;Dynamic Survey 1&quot; of the &quot;Electronic Journal of Combinatorics&quot;, by Stanisław Radziszowski, which is periodically updated. Where not cited otherwise, entries in the table below are taken from the June 2024 edition. (Note there is a trivial symmetry across the diagonal since .)

=== Asymptotics ===
The inequality may be applied inductively to prove that
:formula_20

In particular, this result, due to Erdős and Szekeres, implies that when ,
:formula_21

An exponential lower bound,
:formula_22

was given by Erdős in 1947 and was instrumental in his introduction of the probabilistic method. There is a huge gap between these two bounds: for example, for , this gives . Nevertheless, the exponential growth factors of either bound were not improved for a long time, and for the lower bound it still stands at . There is no known explicit construction producing an exponential lower bound. The best known lower and upper bounds for diagonal Ramsey numbers are
:formula_23

due to Spencer and Conlon, respectively; a 2023 preprint by Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe claims to have made exponential progress using an algorithmic construction relying on a graph structure called a &quot;book&quot;, improving the upper bound to
:formula_24
with formula_25 and formula_26.

A 2024 preprint by Gupta, Ndiaye, Norin, and Wei claims an improvement of formula_27 to formula_28, and the diagonal Ramsey upper bound to

formula_29

For the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers , it is known that they are of order ; this may be stated equivalently as saying that the smallest possible independence number in an -vertex triangle-free graph is
:formula_30

The upper bound for is given by Ajtai, Komlós, and Szemerédi, the lower bound was obtained originally by Kim, and the implicit constant was improved independently by Fiz Pontiveros, Griffiths and Morris, and Bohman and Keevash, by analysing the triangle-free process. 

In general, studying the more general &quot;-free process&quot; has set the best known asymptotic lower bounds for general off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, 
:formula_31

In particular this gives an upper bound of formula_32. Mattheus and Verstraete (2024) gave a lower bound of formula_33, determining the asymptotics of formula_34 up to logarithmic factors, and settling a question of Erdős, who offered 250 dollars for a proof that the lower limit has form formula_35.

=== Formal verification of Ramsey numbers ===

The Ramsey number formula_36 and formula_37 have been formally verified to be 28 and 36. This verification was achieved using a combination of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving and computer algebra systems (CAS). The proof was generated automatically using the SAT+CAS approach, marking the first certifiable proof of formula_38 and formula_39. The verification process for formula_36 and formula_37 was conducted using the SAT+CAS framework MathCheck, which integrates a SAT solver with a computer algebra system. The verification for formula_38 was completed in approximately 8 hours of wall clock time, producing a total proof size of 5.8 GiB. The verification for formula_43 was significantly more computationally intensive, requiring 26 hours of wall clock time and generating 289 GiB of proof data. The correctness of these results was independently verified using a modified version of the DRAT-trim proof checker.

The Ramsey number formula_44 has been formally verified to be 25. The original proof, developed by McKay and Radziszowski in 1995, combined high-level mathematical arguments with computational steps and used multiple independent implementations to reduce the possibility of programming errors. This new formal proof was carried out using the HOL4 interactive theorem prover, limiting the potential for errors to the HOL4 kernel. Rather than directly verifying the original algorithms, the authors utilized HOL4&#x27;s interface to the MiniSat SAT solver to formally prove key gluing lemmas.

== Induced Ramsey ==
There is a less well-known yet interesting analogue of Ramsey&#x27;s theorem for induced subgraphs. Roughly speaking, instead of finding a monochromatic subgraph, we are now required to find a monochromatic induced subgraph. In this variant, it is no longer sufficient to restrict our focus to complete graphs, since the existence of a complete subgraph does not imply the existence of an induced subgraph. The qualitative statement of the theorem in the next section was first proven independently by Erdős, Hajnal and Pósa, Deuber and Rödl in the 1970s. Since then, there has been much research in obtaining good bounds for induced Ramsey numbers.

=== Statement ===
Let be a graph on vertices. Then, there exists a graph such that any coloring of the edges of using two colors contains a monochromatic induced copy of (i.e. an induced subgraph of such that it is isomorphic to and its edges are monochromatic). The smallest possible number of vertices of is the induced Ramsey number .

Sometimes, we also consider the asymmetric version of the problem. We define to be the smallest possible number of vertices of a graph such that every coloring of the edges of using only red or blue contains a red induced subgraph of or blue induced subgraph of .

=== History and bounds ===

Similar to Ramsey&#x27;s theorem, it is unclear a priori whether induced Ramsey numbers exist for every graph . In the early 1970s, Erdős, Hajnal and Pósa, Deuber and Rödl independently proved that this is the case. However, the original proofs gave terrible bounds (e.g. towers of twos) on the induced Ramsey numbers. It is interesting to ask if better bounds can be achieved. In 1974, Paul Erdős conjectured that there exists a constant such that every graph on vertices satisfies . If this conjecture is true, it would be optimal up to the constant because the complete graph achieves a lower bound of this form (in fact, it&#x27;s the same as Ramsey numbers). However, this conjecture is still open as of now.

In 1984, Erdős and Hajnal claimed that they proved the bound
:formula_45
However, that was still far from the exponential bound conjectured by Erdős. It was not until 1998 when a major breakthrough was achieved by Kohayakawa, Prömel and Rödl, who proved the first almost-exponential bound of for some constant . Their approach was to consider a suitable random graph constructed on projective planes and show that it has the desired properties with nonzero probability. The idea of using random graphs on projective planes have also previously been used in studying Ramsey properties with respect to vertex colorings and the induced Ramsey problem on bounded degree graphs .

Kohayakawa, Prömel and Rödl&#x27;s bound remained the best general bound for a decade. In 2008, Fox and Sudakov provided an explicit construction for induced Ramsey numbers with the same bound. In fact, they showed that every -graph with small and suitable contains an induced monochromatic copy of any graph on vertices in any coloring of edges of in two colors. In particular, for some constant , the Paley graph on vertices is such that all of its edge colorings in two colors contain an induced monochromatic copy of every -vertex graph.

In 2010, Conlon, Fox and Sudakov were able to improve the bound to , which remains the current best upper bound for general induced Ramsey numbers. Similar to the previous work in 2008, they showed that every -graph with small and edge density contains an induced monochromatic copy of every graph on vertices in any edge coloring in two colors. Currently, Erdős&#x27;s conjecture that remains open and is one of the important problems in extremal graph theory.

For lower bounds, not much is known in general except for the fact that induced Ramsey numbers must be at least the corresponding Ramsey numbers. Some lower bounds have been obtained for some special cases (see Special Cases).

=== Special cases ===
While the general bounds for the induced Ramsey numbers are exponential in the size of the graph, the behaviour is much different on special classes of graphs (in particular, sparse ones). Many of these classes have induced Ramsey numbers polynomial in the number of vertices.

If is a cycle, path or star on vertices, it is known that is linear in .

If is a tree on vertices, it is known that . It is also known that is superlinear (i.e. ). Note that this is in contrast to the usual Ramsey numbers, where the Burr–Erdős conjecture (now proven) tells us that is linear (since trees are 1-degenerate).

For graphs with number of vertices and bounded degree , it was conjectured that , for some constant depending only on . This result was first proven by Łuczak and Rödl in 1996, with growing as a tower of twos with height . More reasonable bounds for were obtained since then. In 2013, Conlon, Fox and Zhao showed using a counting lemma for sparse pseudorandom graphs that , where the exponent is best possible up to constant factors.

=== Generalizations ===
Similar to Ramsey numbers, we can generalize the notion of induced Ramsey numbers to hypergraphs and multicolor settings.

==== More colors ====
We can also generalize the induced Ramsey&#x27;s theorem to a multicolor setting. For graphs , define to be the minimum number of vertices in a graph such that any coloring of the edges of into colors contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to where all edges are colored in the -th color for some . Let ( copies of ).

It is possible to derive a bound on which is approximately a tower of two of height by iteratively applying the bound on the two-color case. The current best known bound is due to Fox and Sudakov, which achieves , where is the number of vertices of and is a constant depending only on .

==== Hypergraphs ====
We can extend the definition of induced Ramsey numbers to -uniform hypergraphs by simply changing the word &quot;graph&quot; in the statement to &quot;hypergraph&quot;. Furthermore, we can define the multicolor version of induced Ramsey numbers in the same way as the previous subsection.

Let be a -uniform hypergraph with vertices. Define the tower function by letting and for , . Using the hypergraph container method, Conlon, Dellamonica, La Fleur, Rödl and Schacht were able to show that for , for some constant depending on only and . In particular, this result mirrors the best known bound for the usual Ramsey number when .

== Extensions of the theorem ==
=== Infinite graphs ===
A further result, also commonly called &quot;Ramsey&#x27;s theorem&quot;, applies to infinite graphs. In a context where finite graphs are also being discussed it is often called the &quot;Infinite Ramsey theorem&quot;. As intuition provided by the pictorial representation of a graph is diminished when moving from finite to infinite graphs, theorems in this area are usually phrased in set-theoretic terminology.

:&quot;Theorem.&quot; Let formula_46 be some infinite set and colour the elements of formula_47 (the subsets of formula_46 of size formula_49) in formula_50 different colours. Then there exists some infinite subset formula_51 of formula_46 such that the size formula_49 subsets of formula_51 all have the same colour.

&quot;Proof&quot;: The proof is by induction on , the size of the subsets. For , the statement is equivalent to saying that if you split an infinite set into a finite number of sets, then one of them is infinite. This is evident. Assuming the theorem is true for , we prove it for . Given a -colouring of the -element subsets of , let be an element of and let We then induce a -colouring of the -element subsets of , by just adding to each -element subset (to get an -element subset of ). By the induction hypothesis, there exists an infinite subset of such that every -element subset of is coloured the same colour in the induced colouring. Thus there is an element and an infinite subset such that all the -element subsets of consisting of and elements of have the same colour. By the same argument, there is an element in and an infinite subset of with the same properties. Inductively, we obtain a sequence such that the colour of each -element subset with depends only on the value of . Further, there are infinitely many values of such that this colour will be the same. Take these &#x27;s to get the desired monochromatic set.

A stronger but unbalanced infinite form of Ramsey&#x27;s theorem for graphs, the Erdős–Dushnik–Miller theorem, states that every infinite graph contains either a countably infinite independent set, or an infinite clique of the same cardinality as the original graph.

==== Infinite version implies the finite ====
It is possible to deduce the finite Ramsey theorem from the infinite version by a proof by contradiction. Suppose the finite Ramsey theorem is false. Then there exist integers , , such that for every integer , there exists a -colouring of without a monochromatic set of size . Let denote the -colourings of without a monochromatic set of size .

For any , the restriction of a colouring in to (by ignoring the colour of all sets containing ) is a colouring in . Define to be the colourings in which are restrictions of colourings in . Since is not empty, neither is .

Similarly, the restriction of any colouring in is in , allowing one to define as the set of all such restrictions, a non-empty set. Continuing so, define for all integers , .

Now, for any integer ,
:formula_55
and each set is non-empty. Furthermore, is finite as
:formula_56
It follows that the intersection of all of these sets is non-empty, and let
:formula_57
Then every colouring in is the restriction of a colouring in . Therefore, by unrestricting a colouring in to a colouring in , and continuing doing so, one constructs a colouring of formula_58 without any monochromatic set of size . This contradicts the infinite Ramsey theorem.

If a suitable topological viewpoint is taken, this argument becomes a standard compactness argument showing that the infinite version of the theorem implies the finite version.

=== Hypergraphs ===
The theorem can also be extended to hypergraphs. An -hypergraph is a graph whose &quot;edges&quot; are sets of vertices – in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices. The full statement of Ramsey&#x27;s theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers and , and any integers , there is an integer such that if the hyperedges of a complete -hypergraph of order are coloured with different colours, then for some between 1 and , the hypergraph must contain a complete sub--hypergraph of order whose hyperedges are all colour . This theorem is usually proved by induction on , the &#x27;hyper-ness&#x27; of the graph. The base case for the proof is , which is exactly the theorem above.

For we know the exact value of one non-trivial Ramsey number, namely . This fact was established by Brendan McKay and Stanisław Radziszowski in 1991. Additionally, we have: , and .

=== Directed graphs ===
It is also possible to define Ramsey numbers for &quot;directed&quot; graphs; these were introduced by . Let be the smallest number such that any complete graph with singly directed arcs (also called a &quot;tournament&quot;) and with nodes contains an acyclic (also called &quot;transitive&quot;) -node subtournament.

This is the directed-graph analogue of what (above) has been called , the smallest number such that any 2-colouring of the edges of a complete &quot;un&quot;directed graph with nodes, contains a monochromatic complete graph on n nodes. (The directed analogue of the two possible arc &quot;colours&quot; is the two &quot;directions&quot; of the arcs, the analogue of &quot;monochromatic&quot; is &quot;all arc-arrows point the same way&quot;; i.e., &quot;acyclic.&quot;)

We have , , , , , , , and .

=== Uncountable cardinals ===

In terms of the partition calculus, Ramsey&#x27;s theorem can be stated as formula_59 for all finite &quot;n&quot; and &quot;k&quot;. Wacław Sierpiński showed that the Ramsey theorem does not extend to graphs of size formula_60 by showing that formula_61. In particular, the continuum hypothesis implies that formula_62. Stevo Todorčević showed that in fact in ZFC, formula_63, a much stronger statement than formula_62. Justin T. Moore has strengthened this result further. On the positive side, a Ramsey cardinal, formula_65, is a large cardinal axiomatically defined to satisfy the related formula: formula_66. The existence of Ramsey cardinals cannot be proved in ZFC.

== Relationship to the axiom of choice ==
In reverse mathematics, there is a significant difference in proof strength between the version of Ramsey&#x27;s theorem for infinite graphs (the case &quot;n&quot; = 2) and for infinite multigraphs (the case &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3). The multigraph version of the theorem is equivalent in strength to the arithmetical comprehension axiom, making it part of the subsystem ACA0 of second-order arithmetic, one of the big five subsystems in reverse mathematics. In contrast, by a theorem of David Seetapun, the graph version of the theorem is weaker than ACA0, and (combining Seetapun&#x27;s result with others) it does not fall into one of the big five subsystems. Over ZF, however, the graph version implies the classical Kőnig&#x27;s lemma, whereas the converse implication does not hold, since Kőnig&#x27;s lemma is equivalent to countable choice from finite sets in this setting.

<text>Martin Levi van Creveld (, ; born 5 March 1946) is an Israeli military historian and theorist.

==Life and career==
Van Creveld was born in the Netherlands in the city of Rotterdam to a Jewish family. His parents, Leon and Margaret, were staunch Zionists who had managed to evade the gestapo during World War II.

In 1950, his family immigrated to Israel, and Creveld grew up in Ramat Gan. From 1964 to 1969, he studied history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and earned an M.A. From 1969 to 1971, he studied history at the London School of Economics and received a PhD. His thesis was titled Greece and Yugoslavia in Hitler&#x27;s strategy, 1940–1941.

Van Creveld&#x27;s doctoral dissertation on Hitler&#x27;s strategy in the Balkans during the early years of World War II was published as a book in 1973: &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Strategy, 1940–41. The Balkan Clue.&quot; After completing his PhD in 1971, van Creveld returned to Israel and began teaching at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He became a professor in 1988. In 2007, he retired from teaching at Hebrew University, and began teaching at Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Security Studies Program.

Van Creveld has been married twice and has three children. He lives in Mevaseret Zion.

==Books==
Van Creveld is the author of thirty-three books on military history, strategy, and other topics, of which &quot;Command in War&quot; (1985), &quot;Supplying War: Logistics from Wallenstein to Patton&quot; (1977, 2nd edition 2004), &quot;The Transformation of War&quot; (1991), &quot;The Sword and the Olive&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Rise and Decline of the State&quot; (1999) are among the best known. Van Creveld has lectured or taught at numerous civilian and military institutes of higher learning all over the world.

===The Transformation of War===
Of particular significance is his 1991 book &quot;The Transformation of War&quot; (UK: &quot;On Future War&quot;), which was translated into French, German (New German edition in 2004), Russian, and Spanish. In this treatise of military theory, van Creveld develops what he calls the &quot;non-trinitarian&quot; theory of warfare, which he juxtaposes to the famous work by Clausewitz, &quot;On War&quot;.

Clausewitz&#x27;s &quot;trinitarian&quot; model of war (a term of van Creveld&#x27;s) distinguishes between the affairs of the population, the army, and the government. Van Creveld criticizes this philosophy as too narrow and state-focused, thus inapplicable to the study of those conflicts involving one or more non-state actors. Instead, he proposes five key issues of war:
# By whom war is fought – whether by states or by non-state actors
# What is war all about – the relationships between the actors, and between them and the non-combatants
# How war is fought – issues of strategy and tactics
# What war is fought for – whether to enhance national power or as an end to itself
# Why war is fought – the motivations of the individual soldier

Van Creveld notes that many of the wars fought after 1945 were low-intensity conflicts (LICs) which powerful states ended up losing. The book argues that we are seeing a decline of the nation-state, without a comparable decline in organized violence. Moreover, in his view, armies consistently train and equip to fight a conventional war, rather than the LICs they are likely to face. Consequently, it is imperative that nation-states change the training of their armed forces and rethink their weapon procurement programs.

The book&#x27;s significance is attested to by the fact that until the middle of 2008, it was included on the list of required reading for United States Army officers, and (with Sun Tzu and Clausewitz) the third non-American entry on the list.

In a commander&#x27;s quest for certainty in battlefield information, Van Creveld popularized &quot;directed telescope&quot; as a term to describe the use of specially selected and trusted officers as special agents or observers for the commander&quot;.

===The Privileged Sex===
In addition to his books on military history, van Creveld has written several books on other issues. The most prominent of these is perhaps his anti-feminist polemic &quot;The Privileged Sex&quot; (2013). In the book, van Creveld argues that the systematical oppression of women (as claimed by feminists) is a myth unsupported by any serious data and that women tend to enjoy more social protections and privileges than do men.

==Views on current affairs==
In addition to writing on military history, van Creveld also comments, often pointedly, on contemporary societies and politics.

In a TV interview in 2002, he expressed doubts as to the ability of the Israeli army to defeat the Palestinians:

They [Israeli soldiers] are very brave people... they are idealists... they want to serve their country and they want to prove themselves. The problem is that you cannot prove yourself against someone who is much weaker than yourself. They are in a lose-lose situation. If you are strong and fighting the weak, then if you kill your opponent then you are a scoundrel... if you let him kill you, then you are an idiot. So here is a dilemma which others have suffered before us, and for which as far as I can see there is simply no escape. Now the Israeli army has not by any means been the worst of the lot. It has not done what for instance the Americans did in Vietnam... it did not use napalm, it did not kill millions of people. So everything is relative, but by definition, to return to what I said earlier if you are strong and you are fighting the weak, then anything you do is criminal.

In a September 2003 interview in &quot;Elsevier&quot;, a Dutch weekly, on Israel and the dangers it faces from Iran, the Palestinians and world opinion van Creveld stated, referring to the Samson Option:

We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome. Most European capitals are targets for our air force…. We have the capability to take the world down with us. And I can assure you that that will happen before Israel goes under.

On 21 August 2004 edition of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; van Creveld wrote, &quot;Had the Iranians not tried to build nuclear weapons, they would be crazy.&quot;

In 2005, van Creveld made headlines when he said in an interview that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was &quot;the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 sent his legions into Germany and lost them&quot;, a reference to the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. His analysis included harsh criticism of the Bush administration, comparing the war to the Vietnam war. Moreover, he said that &quot;Bush deserves to be impeached and, once he has been removed from office, put on trial.&quot;

In 2007, van Creveld commented that

Iran is the real victor in Iraq, and the world must now learn to live with a nuclear Iran the way we learned to live with the nuclear Soviet Union and a nuclear China... We Israelis have what it takes to deter an Iranian attack. We are in no danger at all of having an Iranian nuclear weapon dropped on us... thanks to the Iranian threat, we are getting weapons from the U.S. and Germany.

Van Creveld viewed the Second Lebanon War as a strategic success for Israel and a Hezbollah defeat. He was also highly critical of the Winograd Commission&#x27;s report for its failure to note the many successes brought about by Israel&#x27;s military campaign. He noted that Hezbollah &quot;had the fight knocked out of it,&quot; lost hundreds of its members and that the organization was &quot;thrown out of South Lebanon,&quot; replaced by &quot;a fairly robust United Nations peacekeeping force.&quot; He also noted that as a result of the war, Israel is experiencing a level of calm on its Lebanon border not seen since the mid-1960s. More recently, in an article published in &quot;Infinity Journal&quot; in June 2011, titled &quot;The Second Lebanon War: A Reassessment&quot;, Martin van Creveld argued that contrary to the common view, and despite &quot;clumsy, heavy-handed, and slow&quot; ground operations, the Second Lebanon War was a great victory for Israel. He states that as a result of the war, &quot;since the middle of August 2006, all over southern Lebanon hardly a shot has been fired.&quot;

In an opinion piece published in &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; in 2010, van Creveld argued that the West Bank, far from being vital to Israel&#x27;s security, is a territory &quot;that Israel can easily afford to give up.&quot; Van Creveld contended that the West Bank offers no defense against ballistic missiles from Israel&#x27;s two chief enemies, Iran and Syria. Furthermore, provided that it would be demilitarized in any future peace settlement with the Palestinians, the West Bank would act as a natural barrier impeding the advance of any army endeavoring to invade Israel by land from the east. Lastly, Israel could defend itself against terrorism from the West Bank by means of a wall coupled with offensive campaigns the likes of Operation Cast Lead and the Second Lebanon War, which successfully restored Israel&#x27;s deterrence factor when the level of terrorism exceeded what Israel was willing to tolerate.

In an article co-authored with a Cambridge researcher of Middle Eastern history, Jason Pack, addressing the 2011 Libyan civil war, van Creveld challenged the media&#x27;s tendency to portray the circumstances in Libya as being largely equivalent to those that formed the backdrop to the overthrow of ben-Ali in Tunisia and Mubarak in Egypt earlier in the year. &quot;The remarkable spread of the 2011 Arab revolts across the face of North Africa causes many journalists to portray the current Libyan uprising as fueled by similar factors to those at play in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt. There are more differences than similarities.&quot; Van Creveld noted that Tunisia and Egypt &quot;have been coherent nation-states for well over a century,&quot; while Libyan society is still pervasively tribalist. He also observed that whereas the armies of Tunisia and Egypt could mediate the transitions between the old regimes and the new, &quot;Libya lacks a professional, non-tribal army&quot; that could function in such a role. Van Creveld blamed Gaddafi&#x27;s son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi for squandering a crucial opportunity to restore order to the country and confidence – both domestic and international – in the Gaddafi regime.

Van Creveld has stated that the Israeli government has &quot;vastly exaggerated the threat that a nuclear Iran poses to its security, as well as Israel&#x27;s capacity to halt it.&quot;

===Syria and terrorism===
In 2016, in a commentary for the German magazine &quot;Focus&quot;, Creveld advocated an alliance with the Assad regime. &quot;If the West wants to win the war against the caliphate of terror, they cannot be picky about their allies&quot;. The regional conflict was not about a despot, but about a novel form of terrorism aiming at the dissolution of all state order and territorial boundaries in the whole region. Only the Alawite soldiers of the Assad regime were willing to die fighting the terrorists, whereas the European and American attempts to avoid bloodshed concentrating on airstrikes, were useless against Guerrilla troops as history had shown. Losing the war against IS and Al Nusra would have incalculable consequences for the Middle East and for Europe. In comparison, Assad would appear as the &quot;lesser devil&quot;.

As early as 2013, again in the magazine &quot;Focus&quot;, he regarded support for Assad as important to avoid the destabilization of the Middle East as a whole. Assad would continue the war only to prevent a still larger carnage, the annihilation of the 1.2 million Alawites. &quot;Instead of complaining about humanitarian concerns and arguing about arms deliveries to the rebels, the West should join Russia and press for a negotiation solution. If necessary, the West should help the rebels and allow Assad to stay on his post: he is the only person who can hold the country together.&quot; Van Creveld quoted Bismarck: &quot;Politics is the choice between the bad and the worse.&quot; In a lecture at the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung in Brandenburg he pleaded to follow a &quot;pragmatic path&quot; in Syria.

In 2011, looking back at Bashar&#x27;s father, he analyzed the strategy of Hafez Al-Assad against the town of Hama in 1982, then the center of the Muslim Brothers. Without this action, seen as extremely brutal and as a war crime by Creveld, Assad&#x27;s regime would probably have been overthrown. Assad himself and many members of the Alawite community would have been killed. After Assad&#x27;s removal, perhaps a stable regime would have been established by non-Alawite Muslims, or – the more likely variant in Martin van Creveld&#x27;s view – there would have been no stable government at all. In this case, there would have been a war of everyone against everyone. &quot;Judging from the experience in neighboring Beirut, such a civil war could have cost hundreds of thousands of people. And, according to what happened in Lebanon and Afghanistan, Syria could have developed into a place teeming with international terrorists of every direction.&quot;

<text>Photonics is a branch of optics that involves the application of generation, detection, and manipulation of light in the form of photons through emission, transmission, modulation, signal processing, switching, amplification, and sensing. 

Photonics is closely related to quantum electronics, where quantum electronics deals with the theoretical part of it while photonics deal with its engineering applications. Though covering all light&#x27;s technical applications over the whole spectrum, most photonic applications are in the range of visible and near-infrared light. 

The term &quot;photonics&quot; developed as an outgrowth of the first practical semiconductor light emitters invented in the early 1960s and optical fibers developed in the 1970s.

==History==
The word &#x27;Photonics&#x27; is derived from the Greek word &quot;phos&quot; meaning light (which has genitive case &quot;photos&quot; and in compound words the root &quot;photo-&quot; is used); it appeared in the late 1960s to describe a research field whose goal was to use light to perform functions that traditionally fell within the typical domain of electronics, such as telecommunications, information processing, etc.

An early instance of the word was in a December 1954 letter from John W. Campbell to Gotthard Gunther:Incidentally, I’ve decided to invent a new science — photonics. It bears the same relationship to Optics that electronics does to electrical engineering. Photonics, like electronics, will deal with the individual units; optics and EE deal with the group-phenomena! And note that you can do things with electronics that are impossible in electrical engineering!Photonics as a field began with the invention of the maser and laser in 1958 to 1960. Other developments followed: the laser diode in the 1970s, optical fibers for transmitting information, and the erbium-doped fiber amplifier. These inventions formed the basis for the telecommunications revolution of the late 20th century and provided the infrastructure for the Internet.

Though coined earlier, the term photonics came into common use in the 1980s as fiber-optic data transmission was adopted by telecommunications network operators. At that time, the term was used widely at Bell Laboratories. Its use was confirmed when the IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society established an archival journal named Photonics Technology Letters at the end of the 1980s.

During the period leading up to the dot-com crash circa 2001, photonics was a field focused largely on optical telecommunications. However, photonics covers a huge range of science and technology applications, including laser manufacturing, biological and chemical sensing, medical diagnostics and therapy, display technology, and optical computing. Further growth of photonics is likely if current silicon photonics developments are successful.

==Relationship to other fields==

===Classical optics===
Photonics is closely related to optics. Classical optics long preceded the discovery that light is quantized, when Albert Einstein famously explained the photoelectric effect in 1905. Optics tools include the refracting lens, the reflecting mirror, and various optical components and instruments developed throughout the 15th to 19th centuries. Key tenets of classical optics, such as Huygens Principle, developed in the 17th century, Maxwell&#x27;s Equations and the wave equations, developed in the 19th, do not depend on quantum properties of light.

===Modern optics===
Photonics is related to quantum optics, optomechanics, electro-optics, optoelectronics and quantum electronics. However, each area has slightly different connotations by scientific and government communities and in the marketplace. Quantum optics often connotes fundamental research, whereas photonics is used to connote applied research and development.

The term &quot;photonics&quot; more specifically connotes:
* The particle properties of light,
* The potential of creating signal processing device technologies using photons,
* The practical application of optics, and
* An analogy to electronics.

The term optoelectronics connotes devices or circuits that comprise both electrical and optical functions, i.e., a thin-film semiconductor device. The term electro-optics came into earlier use and specifically encompasses nonlinear electrical-optical interactions applied, e.g., as bulk crystal modulators such as the Pockels cell, but also includes advanced imaging sensors.

An important aspect in the modern definition of Photonics is that there is not necessarily a widespread agreement in the perception of the field boundaries. Following a source on optics.org, the response of a query from the publisher of Journal of Optics: A Pure and Applied Physics to the editorial board regarding streamlining the name of the journal reported significant differences in the way the terms &quot;optics&quot; and &quot;photonics&quot; describe the subject area, with some description proposing that &quot;photonics embraces optics&quot;. In practice, as the field evolves, evidences that &quot;modern optics&quot; and Photonics are often used interchangeably are very diffused and absorbed in the scientific jargon.

===Emerging fields===
Photonics also relates to the emerging science of quantum information and quantum optics. Other emerging fields include:

* Optoacoustics or photoacoustic imaging where laser energy delivered into biological tissues will be absorbed and converted into heat, leading to ultrasonic emission. 
* Optomechanics, which involves the study of the interaction between light and mechanical vibrations of mesoscopic or macroscopic objects; 
* Optomics, in which devices integrate both photonic and atomic devices for applications such as precision timekeeping, navigation, and metrology; 
* Plasmonics, which studies the interaction between light and plasmons in dielectric and metallic structures. Plasmons are the quantizations of plasma oscillations; when coupled to an electromagnetic wave, they manifest as surface plasmon polaritons or localized surface plasmons. 
* Polaritonics, which differs from photonics in that the fundamental information carrier is a polariton. Polaritons are a mixture of photons and phonons, and operate in the range of frequencies from 300 gigahertz to approximately 10 terahertz.
* Programmable photonics, which studies the development of photonic circuits that can be reprogrammed to implement different functions in the same fashion as an electronic FPGA

==Applications==
Applications of photonics are ubiquitous. Included are all areas from everyday life to the most advanced science, e.g. light detection, telecommunications, information processing, photovoltaics, photonic computing, lighting, metrology, spectroscopy, holography, medicine (surgery, vision correction, endoscopy, health monitoring), biophotonics, military technology, laser material processing, art diagnostics (involving infrared reflectography, X-rays, ultraviolet fluorescence, XRF), agriculture, and robotics.

Just as applications of electronics have expanded dramatically since the first transistor was invented in 1948, the unique applications of photonics continue to emerge. Economically important applications for semiconductor photonic devices include optical data recording, fiber optic telecommunications, laser printing (based on xerography), displays, and optical pumping of high-power lasers. The potential applications of photonics are virtually unlimited and include chemical synthesis, medical diagnostics, on-chip data communication, sensors, laser defense, and fusion energy, to name several interesting additional examples.

* Consumer equipment: barcode scanner, printer, CD/DVD/Blu-ray devices, remote control devices
* Telecommunications: fiber-optic communications, optical down converter to microwave
* Renewable Energy: Solar power systems
* Medicine: correction of poor eyesight, laser surgery, surgical endoscopy, tattoo removal
* Industrial manufacturing: the use of lasers for welding, drilling, cutting, and various methods of surface modification
* Construction: laser leveling, laser rangefinding, smart structures
* Aviation: photonic gyroscopes lacking mobile parts
* Military: IR sensors, command and control, navigation, search and rescue, mine laying and detection
* Entertainment: laser shows, beam effects, holographic art
* Information processing
* Passive daytime radiative cooling
* Sensors: LIDAR, sensors for consumer electronics
* Metrology: time and frequency measurements, rangefinding
* Photonic computing: clock distribution and communication between computers, printed circuit boards, or within optoelectronic integrated circuits; in the future: quantum computing

Microphotonics and nanophotonics usually includes photonic crystals and solid state devices.

==Overview of photonics research==
The science of photonics includes investigation of the emission, transmission, amplification, detection, and modulation of light.

===Light sources===
Photonics commonly uses semiconductor-based light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), superluminescent diodes, and lasers. Other light sources include single photon sources, fluorescent lamps, cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), and plasma screens. Note that while CRTs, plasma screens, and organic light-emitting diode displays generate their own light, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) like TFT screens require a backlight of either cold cathode fluorescent lamps or, more often today, LEDs.

Characteristic for research on semiconductor light sources is the frequent use of III-V semiconductors instead of the classical semiconductors like silicon and germanium. This is due to the special properties of III-V semiconductors that allow for the implementation of light emitting devices. Examples for material systems used are gallium arsenide (GaAs) and aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) or other compound semiconductors. They are also used in conjunction with silicon to produce hybrid silicon lasers.

===Transmission media===
Light can be transmitted through any transparent medium. Glass fiber or plastic optical fiber can be used to guide the light along a desired path. In optical communications optical fibers allow for transmission distances of more than 100 km without amplification depending on the bit rate and modulation format used for transmission. A very advanced research topic within photonics is the investigation and fabrication of special structures and &quot;materials&quot; with engineered optical properties. These include photonic crystals, photonic crystal fibers and metamaterials.

===Amplifiers===

Optical amplifiers are used to amplify an optical signal. Optical amplifiers used in optical communications are erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, semiconductor optical amplifiers, Raman amplifiers and optical parametric amplifiers. A very advanced research topic on optical amplifiers is the research on quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers.

===Detection===
Photodetectors detect light. Photodetectors range from very fast photodiodes for communications applications over medium speed charge coupled devices (CCDs) for digital cameras to very slow solar cells that are used for energy harvesting from sunlight. There are also many other photodetectors based on thermal, chemical, quantum, photoelectric and other effects.

===Modulation===

Modulation of a light source is used to encode information on a light source. Modulation can be achieved by the light source directly. One of the simplest examples is to use a flashlight to send Morse code. Another method is to take the light from a light source and modulate it in an external optical modulator.

An additional topic covered by modulation research is the modulation format. On-off keying has been the commonly used modulation format in optical communications. In the last years more advanced modulation formats like phase-shift keying or even orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing have been investigated to counteract effects like dispersion that degrade the quality of the transmitted signal.

===Photonic systems===
Photonics also includes research on photonic systems. This term is often used for optical communication systems. This area of research focuses on the implementation of photonic systems like high speed photonic networks. This also includes research on optical regenerators, which improve optical signal quality.

===Photonic integrated circuits===

Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are optically active integrated semiconductor photonic devices. The leading commercial application of PICs are optical transceivers for data center optical networks. PICs fabricated on III-V indium phosphide semiconductor wafer substrates were the first to achieve commercial success; PICs based on silicon wafer substrates are now also a commercialized technology.

Key Applications for Integrated Photonics include:
* Data Center Interconnects: Data centers continue to grow in scale as companies and institutions store and process more information in the cloud. With the increase in data center compute, the demands on data center networks correspondingly increase. Optical cables can support greater lane bandwidth at longer transmission distances than copper cables. For short-reach distances and up to 40 Gbit/s data transmission rates, non-integrated approaches such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers can be used for optical transceivers on multi-mode optical fiber networks. Beyond this range and bandwidth, photonic integrated circuits are key to enable high-performance, low-cost optical transceivers.
* Analog RF Signal Applications: Using the GHz precision signal processing of photonic integrated circuits, radiofrequency (RF) signals can be manipulated with high fidelity to add or drop multiple channels of radio, spread across an ultra-broadband frequency range. In addition, photonic integrated circuits can remove background noise from an RF signal with unprecedented precision, which will increase the signal to noise performance and make possible new benchmarks in low power performance. Taken together, this high precision processing enables us to now pack large amounts of information into ultra-long-distance radio communications. 
* Sensors: Photons can also be used to detect and differentiate the optical properties of materials. They can identify chemical or biochemical gases from air pollution, organic produce, and contaminants in the water. They can also be used to detect abnormalities in the blood, such as low glucose levels, and measure biometrics such as pulse rate. Photonic integrated circuits are being designed as comprehensive and ubiquitous sensors with glass/silicon, and embedded via high-volume production in various mobile devices. Mobile platform sensors are enabling us to more directly engage with practices that better protect the environment, monitor food supply and keep us healthy.
* LIDAR and other phased array imaging: Arrays of PICs can take advantage of phase delays in the light reflected from objects with three-dimensional shapes to reconstruct 3D images, and Light Imaging, Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) with laser light can offer a complement to radar by providing precision imaging (with 3D information) at close distances. This new form of machine vision is having an immediate application in driverless cars to reduce collisions, and in biomedical imaging. Phased arrays can also be used for free-space communications and novel display technologies. Current versions of LIDAR predominantly rely on moving parts, making them large, slow, low resolution, costly, and prone to mechanical vibration and premature failure. Integrated photonics can realize LIDAR within a footprint the size of a postage stamp, scan without moving parts, and be produced in high volume at low cost. 

=== Biophotonics ===

Biophotonics employs tools from the field of photonics to the study of biology. Biophotonics mainly focuses on improving medical diagnostic abilities (for example for cancer or infectious diseases) but can also be used for environmental or other applications. The main advantages of this approach are speed of analysis, non-invasive diagnostics, and the ability to work in-situ.

<text>The Mass () is a form of sacred musical composition that sets the invariable portions of the Christian Eucharistic liturgy (principally that of the Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, and Lutheranism), known as the Mass.

Most Masses are settings of the liturgy in Latin, the sacred language of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Roman Rite, but there are a significant number written in the languages of non-Catholic countries where vernacular worship has long been the norm. For example, there have been many Masses written in English for a United States context since the Second Vatican Council, and others (often called &quot;communion services&quot;) for the Church of England.

Masses can be &quot;a cappella&quot;, that is, without an independent accompaniment, or they can be accompanied by instrumental &quot;obbligatos&quot; up to and including a full orchestra. Many masses, especially later ones, were never intended to be performed during the celebration of an actual mass.

==History==
===Middle Ages===

The earliest musical settings of the mass are Gregorian chant. The different unchanging portions of the mass, collectively known as the Ordinary, came into the liturgy at different times, with the Kyrie probably being first (perhaps as early as the 7th century) and the Credo being last (it did not become part of the Roman mass until 1014).

In the early 14th century, composers began writing polyphonic versions of the sections of the Ordinary. The reason for this surge in interest is not known, but it has been suggested that there was a shortage of new music since composers were increasingly attracted to secular music, and overall interest in writing sacred music had entered a period of decline. The Ordinary then would have music which was available for performance all the time.

Two manuscripts from the 14th century, the Ivrea Codex and the Apt Codex, are the primary sources for polyphonic settings of the Ordinary. Stylistically, these settings are similar to both motets and secular music of the time, with a three-voice texture dominated by the highest part. Most of this music was written or assembled at the papal court at Avignon.

Several anonymous complete masses from the 14th century survive, including the Tournai Mass; however, discrepancies in style indicate that the movements of these masses were written by several composers and later compiled by scribes into a single set. The first complete mass we know of whose composer can be identified was the &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; (Mass of Our Lady) by Guillaume de Machaut in the 14th century.

===Renaissance===
The musical setting of the Ordinary of the mass was the principal large-scale form of the Renaissance. The earliest complete settings date from the 14th century, with the most famous example being the &quot;Messe de Nostre Dame&quot; of Guillaume de Machaut. Individual movements of the mass, and especially pairs of movements (such as Gloria–Credo pairs, or Sanctus–Agnus pairs), were commonly composed during the 14th and early 15th centuries. Complete masses by a single composer were the norm by the middle of the 15th century, and the form of the mass, with the possibilities for large-scale structure inherent in its multiple movement format, was the main focus of composers within the area of sacred music; it was not to be eclipsed until the motet and related forms became more popular in the first decades of the 16th century.

Most 15th-century masses were based on a cantus firmus, usually from a Gregorian chant, and most commonly put in the tenor voice. The cantus firmus sometimes appeared simultaneously in other voices, using a variety of contrapuntal techniques. Later in the century, composers such as Guillaume Dufay, Johannes Ockeghem, and Jacob Obrecht, used secular tunes for cantus firmi. This practice was accepted with little controversy until prohibited by the Council of Trent in 1562. In particular, the song &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; has a long history with composers; more than 40 separate mass settings exist.

Other techniques for organizing the cyclic mass evolved by the beginning of the 16th century, including the paraphrase technique, in which the cantus firmus was elaborated and ornamented, and the parody technique, in which several voices of a polyphonic source, not just one, were incorporated into the texture of the mass. Paraphrase and parody supplanted cantus firmus as the techniques of choice in the 16th century: Palestrina alone wrote 51 parody masses.

Yet another technique used to organize the multiple movements of a mass was canon. The earliest masses based entirely on canon are Johannes Ockeghem&#x27;s &quot;Missa prolationum&quot;, in which each movement is a prolation canon on a freely-composed tune, and the &quot;Missa L&#x27;homme armé&quot; of Guillaume Faugues, which is also entirely canonic but also uses the famous tune &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; throughout. Pierre de La Rue wrote four separate canonic masses based on plainchant, and one of Josquin des Prez&#x27;s mature masses, the &quot;Missa Ad fugam&quot;, is entirely canonic and free of borrowed material.

The &quot;Missa sine nomine&quot;, literally &quot;Mass without a name&quot;, refers to a mass written on freely composed material. Sometimes these masses were named for other things, such as Palestrina&#x27;s famous &quot;Missa Papae Marcelli&quot;, the Mass of Pope Marcellus, and many times they were canonic masses, as in Josquin&#x27;s &quot;Missa sine nomine&quot;.

Many famous and influential masses were composed by Josquin des Prez, the single most influential composer of the middle Renaissance. At the end of the 16th century, prominent representatives of &quot;a cappella&quot; choral counterpoint included the Englishman William Byrd, the Castilian Tomás Luis de Victoria and the Roman Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose &quot;Missa Papae Marcelli&quot; is sometimes credited with saving polyphony from the censure of the Council of Trent. By the time of Palestrina, however, most composers outside of Rome were using other forms for their primary creative outlet for expression in the realm of sacred music, principally the motet and the madrigale spirituale; composers such as the members of the Venetian School preferred the possibilities inherent in the new forms. Other composers, such as Orlande de Lassus, working in Munich and comfortably distant from the conservative influence of the Council of Trent, continued to write parody masses on secular songs. Monteverdi composed masses in stile antico, the &quot;Missa in illo tempore&quot; was published in 1610, one &quot;Messa a 4 da cappella&quot; in 1641 as part of &quot;Selva morale e spirituale&quot; along with single movements of the mass in stile concertato, another &quot;Messa a 4 da cappella&quot; was published after his death, in 1650.

Antoine Brumel composed a M&quot;issa Et ecce terrae motus with the employment of twelve voices,&quot; Stefano Bernardi created masses for double choir for the balconies of the Salzburg Cathedral, such as the 1630 &quot;Missa primi toni octo vocum&quot;, when he was music director of the new building.

===Baroque to Romantic (Catholic and Lutheran traditions)===
The early Baroque era initiated stylistic changes which led to increasing disparity between masses written entirely in the traditional polyphonic manner (stile antico), whose principal advancements were the use of the basso continuo and the gradual adoption of a wider harmonic vocabulary, and the mass in modern style with solo voices and instrumental &quot;obbligatos&quot;. The Lutheran Michael Praetorius composed a mass for double choir in the old style, which he published in 1611 in the collection of church music for the mass in Latin, &quot;Missodia Sionia&quot;. Composers such as Henri Dumont (1610–1684) continued to compose plainsong settings, distinct from and more elaborate than the earlier Gregorian chants.

A further disparity arose between the festive missa solemnis and the missa brevis, a more compact setting. Composers like Johann Joseph Fux in the 18th century continued to cultivate the stile antico mass, which was suitable for use on weekdays and at times when orchestral masses were not practical or appropriate, and in 19th-century Germany the Cecilian movement kept the tradition alive. František Brixi, who worked at the Prague Cathedral, wrote his &quot;Missa aulica&quot;, a missa brevis in C, for four voices, trumpets, violin and continuo, &quot;cantabile&quot; but solo voices just singing short passages within chorale movements. The Italian style cultivated orchestral masses including soloists, chorus and &quot;obbligato&quot; instruments. It spread to the German-speaking Catholic countries north of the Alps, using instruments for color and creating dialogues between solo voices and chorus that was to become characteristic of the 18th-century Viennese style. The so-called &quot;Neapolitan&quot; or &quot;cantata&quot; mass style also had much influence on 18th-century mass composition, with its short sections set as self-contained solo arias and choruses in a variety of styles.

The 18th-century Viennese mass combines operatic elements from the cantata mass with a trend in the symphony and concerto to organize choral movements. The large scale masses of the first half of the century still have Glorias and Credos divided into many movements, unlike smaller masses for ordinary churches. Many of Mozart&#x27;s masses are in missa brevis form, as are some of Haydn&#x27;s early ones. Later masses, especially of Haydn, are of symphonic structure, with long sections divided into fewer movements, organized like a symphony, with soloists used as an ensemble rather than as individuals. The distinction between concert masses and those intended for liturgical use also came into play as the 19th century progressed.

After the Renaissance, the mass tended not to be the central genre for any one composer, yet among the most famous works of the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods are settings of the Ordinary of the Mass. Many of the famous masses of the Romantic era were Requiems, one of the most famous, &quot;A German Requiem&quot; by Brahms, being the composer&#x27;s own selection of biblical texts rather than a setting of a standard liturgy.

===20th and 21st century===

By the end of the 19th century, composers were combining modern elements with the characteristics of Renaissance polyphony and plainchant, which continued to influence 20th-century composers, possibly fueled by the motu proprio &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot; (1903) of Pope Pius X. The revival of choral celebration of Holy Communion in the Anglican Church in the late 19th century marked the beginning several liturgical settings of mass texts in English, particularly for choir and organ. The movement for liturgical reform has resulted in revised forms of the mass, making it more functional by using a variety of accessible styles, popular or ethnic, and using new methods such as refrain and response to encourage congregational involvement. Nevertheless, the mass in its musical incarnation continues to thrive beyond the walls of the church, as is evident in many of the 21st-century masses listed here which were composed for concert performance rather than in service of the Roman Rite.

====Musical reforms of Pius X====
Pope Pius X initiated many regulations reforming the liturgical music of the mass in the early 20th century. He felt that some of the masses composed by the famous post-Renaissance composers were too long and often more appropriate for a theatrical rather than a church setting. He advocated primarily Gregorian plainchant and polyphony. He was primarily influenced by the work of the Abbey of Solesmes. Some of the rules he put forth include the following:
* That any mass be composed in an integrated fashion, not by assembling different compositions for different parts.
* That all percussive instruments should be forbidden.
* That the piano be explicitly forbidden.
* That the centuries&#x27; old practice of &quot;alternatim&quot; between choir and organ be concluded immediately.
* That women must not be present in the choir.

These regulations carry little if any weight today, especially after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. Quite recently, Pope Benedict XVI has encouraged a return to chant as the primary music of the liturgy, as this is explicitly mentioned in the documents of the Second Vatican Council, specifically &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot; 116.

===Masses written for the Anglican liturgy===
These are more often known as &#x27;Communion Services&#x27;, and differ not only in that they are settings of English words, but also, as mentioned above, in that the Gloria usually forms the last movement. Sometimes the Kyrie movement takes the form of sung responses to the Ten Commandments, 1 to 9 being followed by the words &#x27;Lord have mercy upon us and incline our hearts to keep this law&#x27;, and the tenth by &#x27;Lord have mercy upon us and write all these thy laws in our hearts, we beseech thee&#x27;. Since the texts of the &#x27;Benedictus qui venit&#x27; and the &#x27;Agnus Dei&#x27; do not actually feature in the liturgy of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, these movements are often missing from some of the earlier Anglican settings. Charles Villiers Stanford composed a Benedictus and Agnus in the key of F major which was published separately to complete his service in C.

With reforms in the Anglican liturgy, the movements are now usually sung in the same order that they are in the Roman Catholic rite. Choral settings of the Creed, the most substantial movement, are nowadays rarely performed in Anglican cathedrals.

Well known Anglican settings of the mass, which may be found in the repertoire of many English cathedrals are:

* Darke in F
* Darke in E
* Darke in A minor
* Ireland in C
* Stanford in C &amp; F
* Stanford in B flat
* Stanford in A
* Sumsion in F
* Oldroyd, Mass of the Quiet Hour
* Jackson in G
* Howells, Collegium Regale
* Leighton in D
* Harwood in A flat
* Wood in the Phrygian mode

<text>June Foray (born June Lucille Forer; September 18, 1917 – July 26, 2017) was an American voice actress and radio personality, best known as the voice of such animated characters as Rocky the Flying Squirrel, Natasha Fatale, Nell Fenwick, Lucifer from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Cindy Lou Who, Jokey Smurf, Granny from the Warner Bros. cartoons directed by Friz Freleng, Grammi Gummi from &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; series, and Magica De Spell, among many others.

Her career encompassed radio, theatrical shorts, feature films, television, records (particularly with Stan Freberg), video games, talking toys, and other media. Foray was also one of the early members of ASIFA-Hollywood, the society devoted to promoting and encouraging animation. She is credited with the establishment of the Annie Awards, as well as being instrumental in the creation of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2001. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame honoring her voice work in television.

Chuck Jones was quoted as saying: &quot;June Foray is not the female Mel Blanc. Mel Blanc was the male June Foray.&quot;

==Early life==
June Lucille Forer was born on September 18, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of three children of Ida (Robinson) and Morris Forer. Her mother was of Lithuanian Jewish and French Canadian ancestry, and her father was a Jewish emigrant from Odessa, Russian Empire. The family resided at 75 Orange Street, Forest Park. As a small child, Foray first wanted to be a dancer, so her mother sent her to local classes, but she had to drop out due to a case of pneumonia. Her voice was first broadcast in a local radio drama when she was 12 years old; by age 15, she was doing regular radio voice work.

Two years later, after graduating from Classical High School, she moved with her parents and siblings to live in Los Angeles, near Ida&#x27;s brother, after Morris Forer, an engineer, fell on hard financial times.

==Acting career==
After entering radio through the WBZA Players, Foray starred in her own radio series &quot;Lady Make Believe&quot; in the late 1930s. She soon became a popular voice actress, with regular appearances on coast-to-coast network shows including &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot;.

In the 1940s, Foray also began film work, including a few roles in live action movies, but mostly did voice over work for animated cartoons and radio programs and occasionally dubbing films and television. On radio, Foray did the voices of Midnight the Cat and Old Grandie the Piano on &quot;The Buster Brown Program&quot;, which starred Smilin&#x27; Ed McConnell, from 1944 to 1952. She later did voices on the Mutual Broadcasting System program &quot;Smile Time&quot; for Steve Allen. Her work in radio ultimately led her to recording for a number of children&#x27;s albums for Capitol Records.

For Walt Disney, Foray voiced Lucifer the Cat in the feature film &quot;Cinderella&quot;, Lambert&#x27;s mother in &quot;Lambert the Sheepish Lion&quot;, a mermaid in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and Witch Hazel in the Donald Duck short &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;. Decades later, Foray was the voice of Grandmother Fa in the 1998 animated Disney film &quot;Mulan&quot;. She also did a variety of voices in Walter Lantz Productions&#x27; Woody Woodpecker cartoons, including Woody&#x27;s nephew and niece, Knothead and Splinter. Impressed by her performance as Witch Hazel, in 1954 Chuck Jones invited her over to Warner Brothers Cartoons. For Warner Brothers, she was Granny (whom she had played on vinyl records starting in 1950, before officially voicing her in &quot;Red Riding Hoodwinked&quot;, released in 1955, taking over for Bea Benaderet), owner of Tweety and Sylvester, and a series of witches, including Looney Tunes&#x27; own Witch Hazel, with Jones as director. Like most of Warner Brothers&#x27; voice actors at the time (with the exception of Mel Blanc), Foray was not credited for her roles in these cartoons. She played Bubbles on &quot;The Super 6&quot; and Cindy Lou Who, asking &quot;Santa&quot; why he&#x27;s taking their tree, in &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;. In 1960, she provided the speech for Mattel&#x27;s original &quot;Chatty Cathy&quot; doll; capitalizing on this, Foray also voiced the malevolent &quot;Talky Tina&quot; doll in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Living Doll&quot;, first aired on November 1, 1963.

Foray worked for Hanna-Barbera, including on &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and many other shows. In 1959, she auditioned for the part of Betty Rubble on &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and voiced the character in the original pilot episode, opposite Mel Blanc who voiced Betty&#x27;s husband, Barney Rubble, but Bea Benaderet was eventually cast in the role; Foray described herself as &quot;terribly disappointed&quot; at not getting to play Betty. Foray eventually made a guest appearance on &quot;The Flintstones&quot; as the voice of Granny Hatrock in the episode &quot;The Bedrock Hillbillies&quot;.

She did extensive voice acting for Stan Freberg&#x27;s commercials, albums, and 1957 radio series, memorably as secretary to the werewolf advertising executive. She also appeared in several Rankin/Bass TV specials in the 1960s and 1970s, voicing the young Karen and the teacher in the TV special &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot; (although only her Karen singing parts remained in later airings, after Rankin-Bass re-edited the special a few years after it debuted, with Foray&#x27;s dialogue re-dubbed by an uncredited child actress, Suzanne Davidson). She voiced all the female roles in &quot;Rikki-Tikki-Tavi&quot; (1975), including the villainous cobra Nagaina. She played multiple characters on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show&quot;, including Natasha Fatale and Nell Fenwick, as well as male lead character Rocket J. Squirrel (a.k.a. Rocky Squirrel) for Jay Ward, and played Ursula on &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;; and also starred on &quot;Fractured Flickers&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, she became devoted to the preservation and promotion of animation and wrote numerous magazine articles about animation. She and a number of other animation artists had informal meetings around Hollywood in the 1960s, and later decided to formalize this as ASIFA-Hollywood, a chapter of the Association Internationale du Film d&#x27;Animation (the International Animated Film Association). She is credited with coming up with the idea of the Annie Awards in 1972, awarded by ASIFA-Hollywood, having noted that there had been no awards to celebrate the field of animation. In 1988, she was awarded the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award. In 1995, ASIFA-Hollywood established the June Foray Award, which is awarded to &quot;individuals who have made a significant and benevolent or charitable impact on the art and industry of animation&quot;. Foray was the first recipient of the award. She was an enthusiastic member of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute advisory board and frequent host and/or presenter at its annual festivals. In 2007, Foray became a contributor to ASIFA-Hollywood&#x27;s Animation Archive Project. She also had sat on the Governors&#x27; board for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences and lobbied for two decades for the academy to establish an Academy Award for animation; the academy created the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature in 2001 from her petitioning.

In 2007, Britt Irvin became the first person to voice a character in a cartoon remake that had been previously played by Foray in the original series when she voiced Ursula in the new &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; series on Cartoon Network. In 2011, Roz Ryan voiced Witch Lezah (Hazel spelled backwards) in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, opposite June Foray as Granny. Foray also voiced May Parker in &quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; (1981–83), as well as Raggedy Ann on several TV movies, Grandma Howard on &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, Jokey Smurf and Mother Nature on &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, and Magica De Spell and Ma Beagle in &quot;DuckTales&quot;. At the same time, she had a leading role voicing Grammi Gummi on &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, an animated series credited with kickstarting an era of dramatically increased artistic standards for television animation, working with her &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; co-star Bill Scott until his death in 1985.

Foray guest starred only once on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the season one episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;, as the receptionist for the Rubber Baby Buggy Bumper Babysitting Service. This was a play on a &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; gag years earlier in which none of the cartoon&#x27;s characters, including narrator William Conrad, were able to pronounce &quot;rubber baby buggy bumpers&quot; unerringly. Foray was later homaged by &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the season eight episode &quot;The Itchy &amp; Scratchy &amp; Poochie Show&quot;, in which the character June Bellamy (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is introduced as the voice behind both Itchy and Scratchy. According to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; writer and producer Mike Reiss, Foray voiced a few parts at the first table read for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in early 1989 &quot;but she sounded too cartoony for our show&quot;.

Foray appeared on camera in a major role only once, in &quot;Sabaka&quot;, as the high priestess of a fire cult. She also appeared on camera in an episode of &quot;Green Acres&quot; as a Mexican telephone operator. In 1991, she provided her voice as the sock-puppet talk-show host Scary Mary on an episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. She had a cameo role in &quot;Boris &amp; Natasha&quot; (1992), but once again played Rocky and Natasha throughout the feature film &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; (2000). Another on-camera appearance was as herself on an episode of the 1984 TV sitcom &quot;The Duck Factory&quot;.

She was also often called in for ADR voice work for television and feature films. This work included dubbing the voice of Mary Badham in &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Bewitchin&#x27; Pool&quot; and the voices for Sean and Michael Brody in some scenes of the film &quot;Jaws&quot;. She dubbed several people in &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, Diana Rigg in some scenes of &quot;The Hospital&quot;, Robert Blake in drag in an episode of &quot;Baretta&quot; and a little boy in &quot;The Comic&quot;.

===Later career===

In 1996 and 1997, Foray won the Annie Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Television Production for her work in &quot;Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;. In 2000, Foray returned to play Rocky the Flying Squirrel in Universal Pictures&#x27; live-action/CGI animated film &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;, co-starring and produced by Robert De Niro. On Season Three, Episode One (&quot;The Thin White Line&quot;) of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Foray again played Rocky in a visual gag with a single line (&quot;And now, here&#x27;s something we hope you&#x27;ll really like!&quot;). Foray voiced the wife of the man getting dunked (&quot;Don&#x27;t tell him, Carlos!&quot;) in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; attraction. In 2003, she guest starred as the villain Madame Argentina in the &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot; episode, &quot;I See a Funny Cartoon in Your Future&quot;. During this time, Foray also had a regular role, reprising Granny on &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; and also Witch Hazel in an episode of another Warner Bros. Animation series &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot;. In October 2006, she portrayed Susan B. Anthony on three episodes of the podcast &quot;The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd&quot;. In November 2009, Foray appeared twice on &quot;The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack&quot;: in one episode as Ruth, a pie-maker trapped in Bubbie&#x27;s stomach, and in another episode as Kelly, a young boy having a birthday party and as Kelly&#x27;s Mom and Captain K&#x27;Nuckles&#x27; kindergarten teacher.

In 2011, she reprised her role as Granny in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot;, which was her last regular gig. That year, she received the Comic-Con Icon Award at the 2011 Scream Awards. She also appeared as Granny in the theatrically released Looney Tunes short, &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot;, which was shortlisted for Academy Award consideration.

In 2012, Foray received her first Emmy nomination and won in the category of Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program for her role as Mrs. Cauldron on &quot;The Garfield Show&quot;. She thus became, at age 94, the oldest entertainer to be nominated for, and to win, an Emmy Award. She reprised her role of Rocky in a &quot;Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle&quot; short film, which was released in 2014.

In September 2013, she was honored with the Governors Award at the 65th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards. That same year, she reprised her role as Magica De Spell in the video game &quot;&quot;.

==Personal life==
Foray married Bernard Barondess in 1941. The marriage ended in divorce. She met Hobart Donovan while appearing on &quot;The Buster Brown Program&quot; on radio. He was the show&#x27;s main writer and had also written &quot;The Buster Brown&quot; comic book. Foray and Donovan were married from 1955 until Donovan&#x27;s death in 1976. She had no children by either marriage.

In 1973, Foray was an organizer of a meat boycott in response to President Nixon&#x27;s freezing of meat (and other) prices. As a result of this, Foray was included in the Master list of Nixon&#x27;s political opponents, commonly known as &quot;Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List&quot;.

==Death==
Foray died at a hospital in Los Angeles, California, on July 26, 2017, at the age of 99. She had been in declining health since an automobile accident in 2015.

<text>Louis Joseph Ernest Picard (24 December 1821 – 13 May 1877) was a French politician.

==Life==
Louis Joseph Ernest Picard was born in Paris. After taking his doctorate in law in 1846 he joined the Parisian bar. Elected to the &quot;corps législatif&quot; in 1858, he became a follower of Émile Ollivier. 
As Ollivier moved towards the government standpoint, Picard, one of the members of the group known as &quot;Les Cinq&quot;, veered more to the left.

In the 1860s Picard was an active member of the Conférence Molé, as were Léon Gambetta, Clément Laurier and Léon Renault.
At that time the Molé met in the Café Procope in the Rue de l&#x27;Ancienne-Comédie, the oldest coffee house in Paris.

In 1868 he founded a weekly democratic journal, &quot;L&#x27;Electeur libre&quot;, and in 1869 was elected both for Hérault and Paris, electing to sit for the former. From 4 September 1870 he held the portfolio of finance in the government of National Defence. In January 1871 he accompanied Jules Favre to Versailles to arrange the capitulation of Paris, and the next month he became minister of the interior in Adolphe Thiers&#x27;s cabinet.

Attacked both by the monarchist and the republican press, he resigned in May. Later in the year he was sent as ambassador to Brussels, where he remained for two years. On his return to Paris he resumed his seat in the Left centre, and in 1875 became life senator. He died in Paris.

<text>In mathematical queueing theory, Little&#x27;s law (also result, theorem, lemma, or formula) is a theorem by John Little which states that the long-term average number &quot;L&quot; of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate &quot;λ&quot; multiplied by the average time &quot;W&quot; that a customer spends in the system. Expressed algebraically the law is

: formula_1

The relationship is not influenced by the arrival process distribution, the service distribution, the service order, or practically anything else. In most queuing systems, service time is the bottleneck that creates the queue.

The result applies to any system, and particularly, it applies to systems within systems. For example in a bank branch, the customer line might be one subsystem, and each of the tellers another subsystem, and Little&#x27;s result could be applied to each one, as well as the whole thing. ; this rules out transition states such as initial startup or shutdown.

In some cases it is possible not only to mathematically relate the &quot;average&quot; number in the system to the &quot;average&quot; wait but even to relate the entire &quot;probability distribution&quot; (and moments) of the number in the system to the wait.

==History==

In a 1954 paper, Little&#x27;s law was assumed true and used without proof. The form &quot;L&quot; = &quot;λW&quot; was first published by Philip M. Morse where he challenged readers to find a situation where the relationship did not hold. Little published in 1961 his proof of the law, showing that no such situation existed. Little&#x27;s proof was followed by a simpler version by Jewell and another by Eilon. Shaler Stidham published a different and more intuitive proof in 1972. 

==Examples==

=== Finding response time ===

Imagine an application that had no easy way to measure response time. If the mean number in the system and the throughput are known, the average response time can be found using Little’s Law:

:: mean response time = mean number in system / mean throughput

For example: A queue depth meter shows an average of nine jobs waiting to be serviced. Add one for the job being serviced, so there is an average of ten jobs in the system. Another meter shows a mean throughput of 50 per second. The mean response time is calculated as 0.2 seconds = 10 / 50 per second.

=== Customers in the store ===

Imagine a small store with a single counter and an area for browsing, where only one person can be at the counter at a time, and no one leaves without buying something. So the system is:

::&quot;entrance → browsing → counter → exit&quot;

If the rate at which people enter the store (called the arrival rate) is the rate at which they exit (called the exit rate), the system is stable. By contrast, an arrival rate exceeding an exit rate would represent an unstable system, where the number of waiting customers in the store would gradually increase towards infinity.

Little&#x27;s Law tells us that the average number of customers in the store &quot;L&quot;, is the effective arrival rate &quot;λ&quot;, times the average time that a customer spends in the store &quot;W&quot;, or simply:

: formula_2

Assume customers arrive at the rate of 10 per hour and stay an average of 0.5 hour. This means we should find the average number of customers in the store at any time to be 5.
: formula_3

Now suppose the store is considering doing more advertising to raise the arrival rate to 20 per hour. The store must either be prepared to host an average of 10 occupants or must reduce the time each customer spends in the store to 0.25 hour. The store might achieve the latter by ringing up the bill faster or by adding more counters.

We can apply Little&#x27;s Law to systems within the store. For example, consider the counter and its queue. Assume we notice that there are on average 2 customers in the queue and at the counter. We know the arrival rate is 10 per hour, so customers must be spending 0.2 hours on average checking out.
: formula_4

We can even apply Little&#x27;s Law to the counter itself. The average number of people at the counter would be in the range (0, 1) since no more than one person can be at the counter at a time. In that case, the average number of people at the counter is also known as the utilisation of the counter.

However, because a store in reality generally has a limited amount of space, it can eventually become unstable. If the arrival rate is much greater than the exit rate, the store will eventually start to overflow, and thus any new arriving customers will simply be rejected (and forced to go somewhere else or try again later) until there is once again free space available in the store. This is also the difference between the &quot;arrival rate&quot; and the &quot;effective arrival rate&quot;, where the arrival rate roughly corresponds to the rate at which customers arrive at the store, whereas the effective arrival rate corresponds to the rate at which customers &quot;enter&quot; the store. However, in a system with an infinite size and no loss, the two are equal.

==Estimating parameters==

To use Little&#x27;s law on data, formulas must be used to estimate the parameters, as the result does not necessarily directly apply over finite time intervals, due to problems like how to log customers already present at the start of the logging interval and those who have not yet departed when logging stops.

==Applications==
Little&#x27;s law is widely used in manufacturing to predict lead time based on the production rate and the amount of work-in-process.

Software-performance testers have used Little&#x27;s law to ensure that the observed performance results are not due to bottlenecks imposed by the testing apparatus. 

Other applications include staffing emergency departments in hospitals.

==Distributional form==

An extension of Little&#x27;s law provides a relationship between the steady state distribution of number of customers in the system and time spent in the system under a first come, first served service discipline.

<text>Alexandre Florian Joseph, Count Colonna-Walewski (; ; 4 May 181027 September 1868), also Count of the Empire, was a Polish and French politician and diplomat, the unacknowledged son of French emperor Napoleon I.

He is best known for his position as foreign minister of France under his cousin Napoleon III and for his diplomatic efforts presiding over the Congress of Paris, which created peace in the Crimean War and laid the base for modern international law of the sea with the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law.

== Early years ==
&quot;Alexandre Florian Joseph Colonna Walewski&quot; was born on May 4, 1810, at Walewice, near Warsaw, to Countess Maria Walewska, the Polish noblewoman and mistress of Napoleon Bonaparte. His mother conceived him while residing near Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna, where Napoleon was temporarily staying. When Marie requested to give birth in Paris, Napoleon insisted she return to her husband&#x27;s estate in Poland. Count Athanasius Walewski, nearly eighty years old at the time, legally recognized the child as his own. Later in life, Alexandre would write:&quot;My birth was accompanied by lightning and thunder, and it was predicted that my life would be stormy and even life-changing. To satisfy an old family prejudice, I was held at the font by two beggars, which was supposed to bring me luck...&quot;

In 2013, published scholarship comparing DNA haplotype evidence taken from Emperor Napoleon, from his brother King Jérôme Bonaparte&#x27;s descendant Charles, Prince Napoléon and from Colonna-Walewski&#x27;s descendant indicated Alexandre&#x27;s membership in the genetic male-line of the imperial House of Bonaparte.

Upon hearing of Alexandre&#x27;s birth while in Belgium with his new bride, Empress Marie Louise, Napoleon sent an affectionate message and a gift of Brussels laces to Marie Walewska congratulating the birth of the child. Despite the ending of their affair when he married Marie Louise Napoleon ensured Marie and their son were well provided for, granting them a residence in Rue de Montmorency in Paris along with a significant pension of 120,000 francs.

According to Napoleon&#x27;s valet, Constant, Napoleon was deeply moved by the boy&#x27;s resemblance to him. Constant recorded:
 &quot;She was delivered of a son who bore a striking resemblance to His Majesty. This was a great joy for the Emperor. Hastening to her as soon as it was possible for him to get away from the chateau, he took the child in his arms, and embracing it as he had just embraced the mother, he said to him: I will make thee a count.&quot; &lt;/blockquote &gt;

On May 5, 1812, Napoleon officially decreed Alexandre a “Count of the French Empire” and bestowed upon him lands in the Kingdom of Naples. The young Alexandre&#x27;s endowment included sixty-nine farms generating an annual income of 169,516 francs. On June 15, while in Königsberg Napoleon signed letters patent confirming Alexandre&#x27;s title, and his new coat of arms combined the insignias of the Walewski and Laczynski families. While in Paris, his mother Marie Walewska became close friends with the former Empress Joséphine frequently visiting her at Malmaison. Joséphine, who had no children with Napoleon, lavished Marie and young Alexandre with kindness and gifts.

Following Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in 1814, Marie took four-year-old Alexandre to the island of Elba. Many islanders mistook Marie Walewska for Empress Marie Louise and Alexandre for the King of Rome. During their stay, Napoleon played games with the boy and shared affectionate moments.

Napoleon reportedly asked Alexandre: “ I hear you don&#x27;t mention my name in your prayers.&quot; Alexandre admitted he did not, but he did remember to say &quot;Papa Empereur.&quot; Amused, Napoleon remarked, &quot;He&#x27;ll be a great social success, this boy: he&#x27;s got wit.&quot;&lt;/blockquote &gt;

Napoleon&#x27;s physician, Foureau de Beauregard, later wrote to Alexandre, recalling:&quot;You are that pretty little Alexandre that I saw, almost twenty-nine years ago, on the Emperor&#x27;s lap near the Madonna delle Grazie on the island of Elba.&quot;

However, with Empress Marie Louise expected to visit, Napoleon discreetly arranged for Marie and Alexandre to leave the island to avoid scandal. In early 1815, they returned to Paris before Napoleon departed for the Hundred Days campaign. After his defeat at Waterloo, Marie Walewska and Alexandre were present at Malmaison to bid farewell to Napoleon before his exile to Saint Helena. Years later, Alexandre reminisced: I can still see the Emperor... every single feature of his face... He took me in his arms and I remember a tear ran down his face..But I cannot recall what exactly he said to me on that occasion.

In his final will, Napoleon mentioned both Alexandre and his half-brother, Charles Léon, stating:
:&quot;Would not be displeased if little Léon were to enter the judiciary, if that appeals to him. I would like Alexandre Walewski to enter the service of France as a soldier.”

On September 7, 1816, Marie Walewska married Napoleon&#x27;s cousin, Philippe Antoine d&#x27;Ornano, who had been exiled in Brussels for supporting Napoleon during the Hundred Days. Alexandre and his younger half-brother, Antoine, remained in Paris under the care of Marie&#x27;s trusted friend, M. Carite. The family later moved to Liège, where Marie gave birth to another son, Rodolphe, in 1817. Marie passed away on December 11, 1817. In her will, she entrusted the care of Alexandre and Antoine to her brother Theodore Łaczyński while their half brother Rodolphe stayed with his father.

Łaczyński took the boys to Kiernozia in Poland. Alexandre’s uncle would teach them of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic campaigns and of Emperor Napoleon and his court. Expressing his dream to take them to Saint Helena when they were older. To give them an education, Łaczyński would send them to Warsaw, where they studied under a tutor with strong republican and anti-Napoleon views. Łaczyński concerned about this influence, placed them instead in a Jesuit college, where Alexandre made his first communion. In 1820, at the age of ten, Alexandre left Poland for Geneva, where he attended boarding school for four years.

At Aged fourteen, Walewski refused to join the Imperial Russian army and fled to London, thence to Paris, where the French government refused Tsar Alexander I&#x27;s demands for his extradition to Russia.

Upon the accession of Louis-Philippe d&#x27;Orléans to the French throne in 1830, Walewski was dispatched to Poland, later the same year being entrusted by the leaders of the Polish November Uprising of 1830 as a diplomatic envoy to the Court of St James&#x27;s. After the Fall of Warsaw, he took out letters of French naturalization and joined the French Army, being in action in Algeria as a Captain in the &quot;Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique&quot; of the French Foreign Legion.

In 1837 he resigned his commission to begin writing plays and working as a journalist for the press. He is said to have collaborated with the elder Dumas on &quot;Mademoiselle de Belle-Isle&quot; and a comedy of his, &quot;L&#x27;Ecole du monde&quot;, was produced at the &quot;Theâtre Français&quot; in 1840.

== Diplomatic career ==

Later that year the prime minister of France Thiers, also a man of letters, became patron to one of Walewski&#x27;s papers, &quot;Le Messager des Chambres&quot;, before sending him on a mission to Egypt. Under Guizot&#x27;s government Walewski was posted to Buenos Aires to liaise with the British Ambassador, John Cradock, 1st Baron Howden. Prince Louis Napoleon&#x27;s accession to power in France as Napoleon III furthered his career with postings as envoy extraordinary to Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and the Kingdom of the Two-Sicilies before London (1851–55), where he was charged with announcing the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; to the prime minister, Lord Palmerston.
In 1855, Walewski succeeded Drouyn de Lhuys as Minister of Foreign Affairs and he acted as President of, and French plenipotentiary at, the Congress of Paris the following year, leading to peace in the Crimean War and to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law. The latter treaty did contain an important novelty in international law, creating the possibility for nations that were not involved in the establishment of the agreement, to become a party by acceding to the Declaration afterwards.
As foreign minister, Walewski advocated a de-escalating strategy towards Russia, known as &quot;entente&quot;, opposing his emperor&#x27;s strategy in Italy which led to war with Austria in 1859. After leaving the Foreign Ministry in 1860 he became France&#x27;s Minister of State, an office which he held until 1863. He served as Senator from 1855 to 1865, before being appointed to the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot; in 1865 and as President of the Chamber of Deputies by the Emperor, who returned him to the Senate after a revolt against his authority two years later.

Walewski was made a Duke of the Empire &quot;ad personam&quot; in 1866, was elected a member of the &quot;Académie des beaux-arts&quot;, appointed Grand-Cross of the Imperial Order of the Legion of Honour and made a Knight og the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, also receiving the Gold Cross of &quot;Virtuti Militari&quot;.

Alexandre Colonna-Walewski died of a stroke at Strasbourg on 27 September 1868 and is buried at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1995 was the 40th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 13 May 1995 at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTÉ), and presented by Mary Kennedy, the contest was held in Ireland following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot; by Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan. It was the third consecutive contest to be held in Ireland – the first and only time in the history of the event that a country has hosted three editions in a row – and the second consecutive edition to be held in the Point Theatre in Dublin.

Twenty-three countries participated in the contest; , , , the , , , and were relegated as the lowest-scoring countries in the previous edition, getting replaced by , , , , and , returning after being relegated following the .

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, composed by Rolf Løvland, written by Petter Skavlan and performed by Secret Garden. , , , and rounded out the top five, with Spain achieving their best result since . and also achieved their best results so far, placing sixth and seventh respectively, while finished in last place for the fourth time.

==Location==

The 1995 contest took place in Dublin, Ireland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot;, performed by Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan. It was the sixth time that Ireland had hosted the contest, having previously staged the event in , , , and , with all previous events held in Dublin except the 1993 contest which was held in Millstreet. Ireland thus became the first, and only country to have hosted three successive contests.

The selected venue was the Point Theatre, a concert and events venue located amongst the Dublin Docklands which had originally been built as a train depot to serve the nearby port. Opened as a music venue in 1988, it was closed for redevelopment and expansion in 2008 and is now known as the 3Arena. Having previously hosted the 1994 contest, Dublin became the first city to host two consecutive Eurovision Song Contests, with the Point Theatre also serving as the host venue for the second year in a row.

Alternative venues in Galway and Limerick were considered by RTÉ, however Dublin was chosen to stage the contest again as it was judged to have been the more cost-effective location. A proposal by the British broadcaster BBC to host the contest, either by themselves or as a joint production hosted in Belfast, the capital city of Northern Ireland, were also rejected by RTÉ as the Irish broadcaster chose to produce the contest on its own. However, RTÉ did request a rule change to relieve them of the responsibility of producing the contest again should Ireland produce a fourth consecutive winner, which was accepted by the EBU.

==Participating countries==
Twenty-three countries were permitted to participate in the contest, which was to comprise the sixteen highest-scoring countries in the 1994 contest and returning countries that had been relegated and prevented from participating in the previous year&#x27;s event. The total line-up was reduced from the twenty-five countries which participated in the 1994 contest to ensure that the event would not last longer than three hours. Of the seven countries which did not participate in 1994, , , , , and returned to the contest, while and declined the invitation, which resulted in and , which were originally relegated, being allowed back into the line-up. , , , the , , , and , as the lowest-scoring countries from the previous year&#x27;s event, were thus ultimately relegated and were required to miss this event. Switzerland did not participate in the contest for the first time, leaving as the sole country to have participated in every edition of the contest to that point.

The contest featured two representatives who had previously performed in the contest. Arzu Ece had previously represented as a member of the group Pan, and Alexandros Panayi had provided backing vocals for and . Additionally, several artists who had previously participated in the event as main vocalists returned as backing vocalists at this year&#x27;s event: Stefán Hilmarsson and returned to the contest as backing singers for the Icelandic entrant Bo Halldórsson, with Stefán having previously represented as a member of Beathoven and both Stefán and Eyjólfur having represented as a duo; Gary Lux, who had previously represented , as a member of the group Westend, and as a solo artist and , supported Stella Jones at this year&#x27;s event; and José María Guzmán, who represented as part of the group Cadillac, was among Anabel Conde&#x27;s backing singers.


==Production and format==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1995 was produced by the Irish public broadcaster (RTÉ). John McHugh served as executive producer, John Comiskey served as director, Alan Farquharson served as designer, and Noel Kelehan served as musical director, leading the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christian Clausen as scrutineer. RTÉ was reported to have spent IR£2.3 million on staging the contest, with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the National Lottery among the contest&#x27;s sponsors. Through the partnership with the National Lottery, around 1,000 places in the audience were filled by members of the public who had won tickets by playing scratchcards.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-three competing countries, the draw to determine the running order was held on 9 December 1994.

The results of the 1995 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, between men and women, and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

Rehearsals in the contest venue for the competing acts began on 8 May 1995. Each country had two technical rehearsals in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals took place on 8 and 9 May, with each country allowed 40 minutes total on stage, with an opportunity to review recordings with producers and to consult on suggested changes afterwards, followed by a 20 minute press conference. Each country&#x27;s second rehearsals took place on 10 and 11 May, with 30 minutes total on stage. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 12 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 13 May. An audience was present for the second dress rehearsal in the evening of 12 May, with this rehearsal also recorded for use as a production stand-by in case of problems during the live contest. The competing delegations were additionally invited to a welcome reception during the week in the build-up to the event, organised by Irish Ferries and hosted at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham on the evening of 8 May.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 13 May 1995 at 20:00 (IST) and lasted 2 hours and 51 minutes. The show was presented by the Irish journalist and television presenter Mary Kennedy. Kennedy had previously served as the stand-by presenter at the , understudying for Doireann Ní Bhriain.

To celebrate the contest&#x27;s fortieth anniversary, the show opened with a four-minute sequence, directed by Pat Cowap, containing clips and performances from previous contests; Cowap had previously served as director of the 1994 contest. The contest&#x27;s interval act, entitled &quot;, was an original piece composed by Mícheál Ó Súilleabháin and which combined Gregorian chant and sean-nós singing with contemporary music. Among the performers of &quot; were Súilleabháin on piano, Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie, Irish singers Brian Kennedy and Nóirín Ní Riain, members of the Irish folk band Clannad, the Benedictine monks of Glenstal Abbey, and the RTÉ Concert Orchestra conducted by Proinnsías Ó Duinn. Kennedy would go on to perform at Eurovision again as a contestant, representing Ireland in the . The trophy awarded to the winners was designed by Kevin O&#x27;Dwyer, and was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artists Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;, composed by Rolf Løvland, written by Petter Skavlan and performed by Secret Garden. This was Norway&#x27;s second contest win, following the victory by Bobbysocks! ten years previously at the with &quot;, which was also written by Rolf Løvland; Løvland thus became one of four individuals to have won the contest more than once as an artist or songwriter up to that point in time, alongside Willy van Hemert, Yves Dessca and Johnny Logan. The group Secret Garden consisted principally of Norwegian composer and pianist Løvland and Irish violinist Fionnuala Sherry and was formed after the pair had met at the 1994 contest, where Sherry was a member of the RTÉ Concert Orchestra and Løvland was in attendance as composer of . For their performance during the contest they were joined by instrumentalists Hans Fredrik Jacobsen and Åsa Jinder and singer . &quot;&quot; was a largely instrumental piece featuring only 24 words in total, with brief vocals only at the start and end of the song performed by Tvinnereim. The traditional winner&#x27;s reprise performance featured English lyrics, also written by Skavlan, comprising 30 words in total.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1994 was the 39th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 30 April 1994 at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTÉ), and presented by Cynthia Ní Mhurchú and Gerry Ryan, the contest was held in Ireland following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; by Niamh Kavanagh. It was the first time that any country had hosted two successive editions of the contest, following the previous year&#x27;s contest held in Millstreet.

Twenty-five countries participated in the contest, which for the first time featured a relegation system to reduce the number of interested participating countries. Seven new countries participated in the event, with entries from , , , , , and featuring for the first time. However, , , , , and were unable to compete due to the new relegation rules as the lowest-scoring countries at the previous event, whereas decided against participating by choice.

For the third time in a row, won the contest with the song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot;, written by Brendan Graham and performed by Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan. Never before had a country won three times in a row in the history of the contest; at the same time, it was also a record sixth win, cementing Ireland as the country with the most wins in Eurovision history up till that point. Poland, , Hungary and rounded out the top five positions, with Poland achieving the most successful result for a début entry in the contest&#x27;s history.

The 1994 contest also featured the first appearance of &quot;Riverdance&quot;. Originally a seven-minute performance of traditional Irish and modern music, choral singing and Irish dancing featured as part of the contest&#x27;s interval act, it was subsequently developed into a full stage show which has since become a worldwide phenomenon and catapulted the careers of its lead dancers Jean Butler and Michael Flatley.

== Location ==

The 1994 contest took place in Dublin, Ireland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, performed by Niamh Kavanagh. It was the fifth time that Ireland had hosted the contest, following the , and events also held in Dublin, and the previous year&#x27;s event held in Millstreet. Ireland thus became the first country to host two successive contests.

The selected venue was the Point Theatre, a concert and events venue located among the Dublin Docklands and originally built as a train depot and warehouse to serve the nearby port. Opened as a music venue in 1988, it was closed for redevelopment and expansion in 2008 and is now known as the 3Arena. At the time of the contest, the arena could seat around 3,200 audience members.

==Participating countries==
Twenty-five countries were permitted to participate in the contest. As the number of countries interested in participating in the contest grew, and following the use of a qualifying round in the previous year&#x27;s event, a relegation system was introduced to the contest for the first time, which would prevent the lowest-scoring countries from the previous year&#x27;s event from participating in the subsequent contest. In the summer of 1993 the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) confirmed that the seven lowest-scoring countries in the 1993 event would be barred from entering the 1994 contest, to make way for seven countries which would participate for the first time. As a result, , , , , , , and were unable to enter the contest, and in the contest&#x27;s largest single expansion of new participating countries since the first edition in , , , , , , , and made their début appearances. Estonia, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia had all previously participated in the 1993 qualifying round . Belgium thus failed to participate in the contest for the first time, leaving and as the only countries to have competed in every edition of the contest so far. Later in 1993 &#x27;s broadcaster RAI subsequently announced that it would not participate in the event, likely due to a lack of interest in the event among the Italian public and concerns within the broadcaster at the costs of staging the contest in the event that Italy won; this led to Cyprus being readmitted as the relegated country with the best result at the 1993 contest.

Four performers who had competed in previous editions of contests featured among the participating artists at this year&#x27;s event: Marie Bergman, representing with Roger Pontare, had been a member of the group Family Four that had represented the country in the and ; Cyprus&#x27;s Evridiki made a second appearance in the contest, following her entry at the ; Sigga returned to the contest for for a third time, having previously competed as part of Stjórnin in and Heart 2 Heart in 1992; and Elisabeth Andreasson, competing in this event with Jan Werner Danielsen for , also participated for the third time, having been a member of the group Chips, which represented Sweden in , and Bobbysocks!, which had represented Norway and were the winners of the . A number of artists which had previously competed in the contest also returned as backing performers: Rhonda Heath, who was a member of the group Silver Convention that had represented Germany in the , performed as a backing singer for the German entry MeKaDo; and , who represented Iceland at the alongside Stefán Hilmarsson, returned as a backing singer for Sigga. Additionally, having supported &#x27;s William Mangion as backing performers in the previous year&#x27;s event, Moira Stafrace and Christopher Scicluna returned to the Eurovision stage as the country&#x27;s entrants at this year&#x27;s contest.


== Production and format ==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1994 was produced by the Irish public broadcaster (RTÉ). Moya Doherty served as executive producer, Patrick Cowap served as director, Paula Farrell served as designer, and Noel Kelehan served as musical director, leading the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christian Clausen as scrutineer.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks; however, any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-five competing countries, the draw to determine the running order was held on 16 November 1993 at the Point Theatre and was conducted by Niamh Kavanagh and Fionnuala Sweeney.

The results of the 1994 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, between men and women, and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

With the Point Theatre situated on the banks of the River Liffey, rivers were an integral part of the overall creative vision for the show and were a key theme of the opening and interval acts as well as the stage design. Paula Farrell&#x27;s design, which was four times the size of the stage constructed for the Millstreet contest, provided a scene of a futuristic Dublin at night, featuring representations of skyscrapers which incorporated video screens and lighting effects and underfloor lighting representing the Liffey and Dublin Bay. On either side of the stage podium-lined platforms were used by the presenters in-between songs and during the voting segment.

Rehearsals at the contest venue began on 25 April 1994. Each participating delegation took part in two technical rehearsals in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. In each country&#x27;s first rehearsal, held on 25 and 26 April, the delegations were provided with a 15-minute stage-call to prepare the stage and to brief the orchestra, followed by a 25-minute rehearsal. This was then followed by an opportunity to review footage of the rehearsal on video screens and to conduct a 20-minute press conference. The second rehearsals on 27 and 28 April consisted of a 10-minute stage-call and a 20-minute rehearsal. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two in the afternoon and evening of 29 April and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 30 April, with an audience present at the evening rehearsal on 29 April. The competing delegations were additionally invited to a welcome reception during the week of the event, held on the evening of 25 April in the Dining Hall of Trinity College Dublin.

During the final dress rehearsal on 30 April, the Polish entrant Edyta Górniak performed the second half of her song &quot;To nie ja!&quot; in English. As this rehearsal was also heard by the juries this constituted a break of the contest rules. Although discussions were held on whether to sanction or disqualify the country, Poland was ultimately allowed to compete.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 30 April 1994 at 20:00 (IST) and lasted 3 hours and 3 minutes. The show was presented by the Irish journalist and television presenter Cynthia Ní Mhurchú and the Irish radio and television presenter Gerry Ryan. Ní Mhurchú and Ryan had been considered as hosts for the 1993 event before the eventual choice of Fionnuala Sweeney.

The contest was opened with a segment by the Galway-based arts and theatre company Macnas, featuring a mixture of pre-recorded and live footage of a replica Viking longship on the river Liffey, and dancers, flag-bearers and performers in caricature masks of notable Irish personalities in various locations in central Dublin and in the Point Theatre. The interval act, &quot;Riverdance&quot;, was a seven-minute composition by the Irish composer Bill Whelan, and took inspiration from &quot;Timedance&quot;, the interval act from the also held in Dublin. &quot;Riverdance&quot; featured a mix of traditional Irish and modern music by the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, choral singing from the Celtic ensemble Anúna, and Irish dancing led by the Irish-American dancers Jean Butler and Michael Flatley. The trophy awarded to the winners, entitled &quot;Wavelength&quot;, was designed by the Irish sculptor Grace Weir of the Temple Bar Gallery, and was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artist Niamh Kavanagh.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot;, written by Brendan Graham and performed by Paul Harrington and Charlie McGettigan. This marked Ireland&#x27;s sixth contest wina new contest recordand also gave the country its third win in a rowthe first time a country had won three successive contests. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Kids&quot; became the highest scoring winner in Eurovision history to date with 226 points, and was the first song to receive over 200 points. It was also the first time that a song had won without using the orchestra. Harrington and McGettigan additionally became the oldest winning performers and the first winning male duo. First-time participating countries Poland, Hungary and Russia all finished in the top ten, placing second, fourth and ninth respectively, while conversely the four other débuting countries all placed within the bottom seven entries, with Lithuania scoring &quot;nul points&quot; with its first ever entry. Poland achieved the most successful début performance of any country in the contest&#x27;s history at the time, and its second-place finish in this event remains the country&#x27;s best ever Eurovision placing.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. For the first time, the spokespersons were connected to the venue via satellite rather than through telephone lines, allowing them to appear in vision during the broadcast.

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

===12 points===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Ireland received the maximum score of 12 points from eight of the voting countries, with Poland receiving five sets of 12 points, Hungary receiving four sets, Germany two sets, and Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Portugal and Slovakia each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.


== Legacy ==

Although the winning song had modest success, peaking in the Irish Singles Chart at number 2 and also entering the Dutch and Flemish charts following the contest, it was largely overshadowed by the contest&#x27;s interval act. The music to &quot;Riverdance&quot; was subsequently released as a single shortly after the contest and shot straight to number 1 on the Irish charts where it remained for 18 weeks. &quot;Riverdance&quot; remains the second best selling single in Ireland ever, behind Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Something About the Way You Look Tonight&quot;/&quot;Candle in the Wind 1997&quot;. An invite was subsequently given to feature the original seven-minute performance at the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; in November 1994 at the Dominion Theatre in London in the presence of Prince Charles. At the same time preparations were underway to develop the seven-minute performance into a stage show, preparations led by Moya Doherty, who had been the executive producer of Eurovision 1994, and her husband John McColgan. Opening in February 1995 at the Point Theatre and featuring original lead dancers Michael Flatley and Jean Butler, the full-length show ran for an initial run of five weeks, with tickets selling out within three days of going on sale, followed by another sold-out run at the Hammersmith Apollo in London and in March 1996 its first performance in the United States, at the Radio City Music Hall in New York City. It is estimated that &quot;Riverdance&quot; has now been seen live by over 27.5 million people at performances worldwide, and that over 10 million home videos of &quot;Riverdance&quot; performances have been sold.

The relegation system introduced to the contest in this edition continued to be used in various forms for the next ten years and allowed even more new countries to join the event, with , and competing for the first time in , and respectively. However, as the contest continued to develop, and as even more countries began to express an interest in competing, the relegation system proved unable to meet the needs required to allow for an equitable solution for all countries. Ultimately this led to the introduction of a semi-final to the contest format in , allowing all interested countries to participate once again, which was eventually expanded to two semi-finals from .

<text>Eric Heinz Lenneberg (19 September 1921 – 31 May 1975) was a linguist and neurologist who pioneered ideas on language acquisition and cognitive psychology, particularly in terms of the concept of innateness.

==Life and career==
He was born in Düsseldorf, Germany. Ethnically Jewish, he left Nazi Germany because of rising Nazi persecution. He initially fled to Brazil with his family and then to the United States where he attended the University of Chicago and Harvard University. A professor of psychology and neurobiology, he taught at the Harvard Medical School, the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Cornell University and Medical School.

Lenneberg&#x27;s 1964 paper &quot;The Capacity of Language Acquisition,&quot; originally published in 1960, sets forth seminal arguments about the human-specific biological capacity for language, which were then being developed in his research and discussions with George A. Miller, Noam Chomsky, and others at Harvard and MIT, and popularized by Steven Pinker in his book, &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;. He presents four arguments for the biological innateness of psychological capacities, parallel to arguments in biology for the innateness of physical traits:

* Universal appearance of a trait at a single time across a species. &quot;Species typical&quot; traits.
* Universal appearance across time for a group. Not just an artifact of cultural history. Again, &quot;species typical&quot; diagnostic feature.
* No learning of the trait is possible.
* Individual development of a trait rigidly follows a given schedule regardless of the particular experience of the organism.

In his publication &quot;Biological Foundations of Language&quot; he advanced the hypothesis of a critical period for language development; a topic which remains controversial and the subject of debate. Lenneberg&#x27;s biological approach to language was related to developments such as the motor theory of speech perception developed by Alvin Liberman and colleagues at Haskins Laboratories, which also provided historical antecedents to issues now emerging in embodied philosophy and embodied cognition.

Lenneberg reargued extensively against the psychological implications of the work of Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, specifically in regard to the idea that language influences thought. Lenneberg&#x27;s argument against this notion was that &#x27;linguistic and non-linguistic events must be separately observed and described before they can be correlated.&#x27;

==Affiliations==
Lenneberg was quite involved in the scientific community, as he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, the Linguistic Society of America, the American Psychological Association, the Society for Research in Child Development, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

==Education==
He attended primary school in Düsseldorf, Germany until 1933, when he moved to Brazil. In 1949, he received a B.A. from the University of Chicago. Lenneberg then went on to earn a Ph.D. in Psychology and Linguistics from Harvard in 1956.

<doc id="184948" wikidata="Q605215" url="?curid=184948" title="Race to the bottom">
<text>Race to the bottom is a socio-economic concept describing a scenario in which individuals or companies compete in a manner that incrementally reduces the utility of a product or service in response to perverse incentives. This phenomenon is in contrast with traditional competition (economics), which tends to improve goods and services.

== Deregulation ==

The term has primarily been used to described either government deregulation of the business environment or reduction in corporate tax rates, in order to attract or retain economic activity in their jurisdictions. While this phenomenon can happen between countries as a result of globalization and free trade, it also can occur within individual countries between their sub-jurisdictions (states, localities, cities). It may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production. The effect and intent of these actions is to lower labor rates, cost of business, or other factors (pensions, environmental protection and other externalities) over which governments can exert control.

This deregulation lowers the cost of production for businesses. Countries/localities with higher labor, environmental standards, or taxes can lose business to countries/localities with less regulation, which in turn makes them want to lower regulations in order to keep firms&#x27; production in their jurisdiction, hence driving the race to the lowest regulatory standards.

==History and usage==
The concept of a regulatory &quot;race to the bottom&quot; emerged in the United States during the late 1800s and early 1900s, when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to base in their jurisdiction. Some, such as Justice Louis Brandeis, described the concept as the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; and others, as the &quot;race to efficiency&quot;.

In the late 19th century, joint-stock company control was being liberalised in Europe, where countries were engaged in competitive liberal legislation to allow local companies to compete. This liberalization reached Spain in 1869, Germany in 1870, Belgium in 1873, and Italy in 1883. 

In 1890, New Jersey enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower franchise taxes than other states. Delaware attempted to copy the law to attract companies to its own state. This competition ended when Governor Woodrow Wilson tightened New Jersey&#x27;s laws through a series of seven statutes.

In academic literature, the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by A.A. Berle and G.C. Means in &quot;The Modern Corporation and Private Property&quot; (1932). The concept received formal recognition by the US Supreme Court in a decision of Justice Louis Brandeis in the 1933 case &quot;Ligget Co. v. Lee&quot; (288 U.S. 517, 558–559).

Brandeis&#x27;s &quot;race to the bottom&quot; metaphor was updated in 1974 by William Cary, in an article in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, &quot;Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware,&quot; in which Cary argued for the imposition of national standards for corporate governance.

Sanford F. Schram explained in 2000 that the term &quot;race to the bottom&quot;:

The term has been used to describe a similar type of competition between corporations. In 2003, in response to reports that British supermarkets had cut the price of bananas, and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations, Alistair Smith, international co-coordinator of Banana Link, said &quot;The British supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom. Jobs are being lost and producers are having to pay less attention to social and environmental agreements.&quot;

Another example is the cruise industry, with corporations headquartered in wealthy developed nations but which registers its ships in countries with minimal environmental or labor laws, and no corporate taxes.

The term has also been used in the context of a trend for some European states to seize refugees&#x27; assets.

The race to the bottom theory has raised questions about standardizing labor and environmental regulations across nations. There is a debate about if a race to the bottom is actually bad or even possible, and if corporations or nation states should play a bigger role in the regulatory process.

International Political Economy scholar Daniel Drezner (of Tufts University) has described the &quot;race to the bottom&quot; as a myth. He argues that the thesis incorrectly assumes that states exclusively responds to the preferences of capital (and not to other constituents, such as voters), state regulations are sufficiently costly for producers that they would be willing to re-locate elsewhere, and no state has an economy large enough to give it a bargaining power advantage over global capital. A 2022 study found no evidence that global trade competition led to a race to the bottom in labor standards.

A 2001 study by Geoffrey Garrett found that increases were associated with higher government spending, but that the rate of increase in government spending was slower in the countries with the highest increases in trade. Garrett found that increases in capital mobility had no significant impact on government spending. His 1998 book argues against the notion that globalization has undermined national autonomy. He also argues in the book that &quot;macroeconomic outcomes in the era of global markets have been as good or better in strong left-labour regimes (&#x27;social democratic corporatism&#x27;) as in other industrial countries.&quot;

Torben Iversen and David Soskice have argued that social protection and markets go hand-in-hand, as the former resolves market failures. Iversen and Soskice similarly see democracy and capitalism as mutually supportive. Gøsta Esping-Andersen argues against convergence by pointing to presence of a variety of welfare state arrangements in capitalist states. Scholars such as Paul Pierson, Neil Fligstein and Robert Gilpin have argued that it is not globalization per se that has undermined the welfare state, but rather purposeful actions by conservative governments and interest groups that back them. Historical institutionalist scholarship by Pierson and Jacob Hacker has emphasized that once welfare states have been established, it is extremely difficult for governments to roll them back, although not impossible. Nita Rudra has found evidence of a race-to-the-bottom in developing countries, but not in developed countries; she argues that this is due to the elevated bargaining power of labor in developed countries.

Studies covering earlier periods by David Cameron, Dani Rodrik and Peter Katzenstein have found that greater trade openness has been associated with increases in government social spending.

Layna Mosley has argued that increases in capital mobility have not let to convergence, except on a few narrow issues that investors care about. In adjudicating default risk, inflation risk and currency risk, investors use a large number of macroeconomic indicators, which means that investors are unlikely to pressure governments to converge on policies. However, Jonathan Kirshner argues that the hyper mobility of capital has led to considerably monetary policy convergence.

Hegemonic stability theorists, such as Stephen Krasner, Robert Gilpin, and Charles Kindleberger argued that globalization did not reduce state power. To the contrary, they argued that trade levels would decline if the state power of the hegemon declined.

==Taxation==

On 1 July 2021, when 130 countries backed an OECD plan to set a global minimum corporate tax rate, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called it a &quot;historic day.&quot; She said, &quot;For decades, the United States has participated in a self-defeating international tax competition, lowering our corporate tax rates only to watch other nations lower theirs in response... The result was a global race to the bottom: Who could lower their corporate rate further and faster?&quot;

== Environmental policy ==
The race to the bottom has been a tactic widely used among states within the United States of America. The race to the bottom in environmental policy involves both scaling back policies already in place and passing new policies that encourage less environmentally friendly behavior. Some states use this as an economic development strategy, especially in times of financial hardship. For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker decreased state environmental staff&#x27;s capacity in order to accelerate the approval time for a proposed development. Pursuing a race to the bottom philosophy in environmental politics allows states to foster economic growth, but has great consequences for the environment of that state. Conversely, some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy, which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level, with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states. When a state pursues either a race to the bottom or a race to the top strategy, it speaks to its overall environmental agenda.

Races to the bottom pose a threat to the environment globally. Thomas Oatley raises the example of toxic waste regulations. It is expensive to treat chemical waste, so corporations wanting to keep production costs low, may move to countries which do not require them to treat their waste before dumping it. A more concrete example is the hydroelectric dam industry in South America. Gerlak notes that country and community desire for foreign investment in hydroelectric dams has created a race to the bottom in environmental regulations. All dam proposals go through an Environmental Impact Assessment no matter which country or countries it will be implemented in. Each country has a different way of conducting these assessments and different standards the dams must meet for approval. The lack of standard Environmental Impact Assessment standards has caused countries to streamline their Environmental Impact Assessment processes in places like Brazil. In some cases, countries require the assessment only after a dam proposal has already been approved. Other countries allow private developers from foreign firms or foreign nations, such as China to submit the Environmental Impact Assessment, which has the potential to omit certain environmental concerns in order to receive project approval and casts doubt on the legitimacy of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. If Environmental Impact Assessments are not done right there is a risk of dams causing severe social and environmental harm. Environmental Impact Assessments are not the only form of government regulation and dams in South America are just one example of a global trend in deregulation by states in order to bring in more foreign direct investment.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1993 was the 38th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 15 May 1993 at the Green Glens Arena in Millstreet, Ireland. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTÉ), and presented by Fionnuala Sweeney, the contest was held in Ireland following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Why Me?&quot; performed by Linda Martin.

Twenty-five countries participated in the contest, the largest yet held. Twenty-two of the twenty-three countries that had participated in the previous year&#x27;s event returned, with prevented from competing following the closure of its national broadcaster and the placement of sanctions against the country as a response to the Yugoslav Wars. In response to an increased interest in participation from former Eastern Bloc countries following the collapse of communist regimes, three spaces in the event were allocated to first-time participating countries, which would be determined through a qualifying competition. Held in April 1993 in Ljubljana, Slovenia, featured entries from seven countries and resulted in the entries from the former Yugoslav republics of , and progressing to the contest in Millstreet.

For the second year in a row, the winner was with the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, written by Jimmy Walsh and performed by Niamh Kavanagh. The , , , and completed the top five, with the United Kingdom achieving their second consecutive runner-up placing. Ireland achieved their fifth victory in the contest, matching the overall record held by France and , and joined , Luxembourg and as countries with wins in successive contests.

==Location==

The 1993 contest took place in Millstreet, Ireland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Why Me?&quot;, performed by Linda Martin. It was the fourth time that Ireland had hosted the contest, having previously staged the event in , and , with all previous events held in the country&#x27;s capital city Dublin.

The Green Glens Arena, an indoor arena used primarily for equestrian events, was chosen as the contest venue, with its owner Noel C Duggan offering the use of the venue for free, as well as pledging a further from local businesses for the staging of the event. Individuals within RTÉ, including the organisation&#x27;s Director-General Joe Barry, were interested in staging the event outside of Dublin for the first time, and alongside Dublin RTÉ production teams scouted locations in rural Ireland in the months following Ireland&#x27;s win. Although the contest had previously been held in smaller towns, such as Harrogate, an English town of 70,000 people which staged the , with a population of 1,500, Millstreet became the smallest settlement to stage the event at that time and continues to hold the record . The arena would have an audience of around 3,500 during the contest. The choice of Millstreet and the Green Glens Arena to stage the contest was met with some ridicule, with BBC journalist Nicholas Witchell referring to the venue as a &quot;cowshed&quot;, however Millstreet had won out over more conventional locations, including Dublin and Galway, due to the facilities available in the Green Glens Arena and the town&#x27;s local community which were hugely enthusiastic about the event being staged in their area.

Due to the small size of Millstreet, delegations were primarily based in surrounding settlements, including Killarney and other towns in counties Cork and Kerry. Alongside Millstreet itself, Killarney and Cork City held receptions for the competing delegates during the week of the contest, at the Great Southern Hotel in Killarney and Cork&#x27;s City Hall, the latter hosted by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.

==Participating countries==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Eurovision Song Contest regularly featured over twenty participating countries in each edition, and by 1992 an increasing number of countries had begun expressing an interest in joining the event for the first time. This came as a result of revolutions among many European countries that led to the fall of communist regimes and the formation of liberal democratic government among existing states and newly sovereign countries formed from entities within the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. In an effort to incorporate these new countries into the contest, the contest organisers the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) raised the maximum number of participating countries to twenty-fivethe highest number yet seen in the contestcreating space for three new countries to participate alongside twenty-two of the twenty-three countries that had participated in the . which had participated in the contest since was unable to participate as its EBU member broadcaster (JRT) was disbanded in 1992 and its successor organisations (RTS) and (RTCG) were barred from joining the EBU due to sanctions against the country as part of the Yugoslav Wars.

As a temporary solution for the 1993 contest, a qualifying round was organised to determine the three countries which participate in the final for the first time. Subsequently, for the , a relegation system was introduced which would bar the lowest-scoring countries from participating in the following year&#x27;s event. At the running order draw, held in December 1992 at the National Concert Hall in Dublin and hosted by Pat Kenny and Linda Martin, the three new countries were represented as Countries A, B and C, corresponding with the countries that would place first, second and third in the qualifying competition respectively. Entitled , the qualifying round took place on 3 April 1993 in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Initially broadcasters in as many as fourteen countries registered an interest in competing in the event, however only seven countries eventually submitted entries, representing , , , , , and . Ultimately the entries from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were chosen to progress to the contest proper in Millstreet; as constituent republics of SFR Yugoslavia, representatives from all three countries had previously competed in the contest.

A number of artists who had previously participated in the contest were featured among the performers at this event, either as the main performing artist or as backing performers: Tony Wegas represented for a second consecutive year, and among his backing performers was Gary Lux, who had previously represented Austria in the contest on three occasions, as a member of the group Westend in and as a solo artist in and ; Katri Helena made a second contest appearance for , having previously competed in ; &#x27;s Tommy Seebach, having previously competed in 1979 as a solo artist and in alongside Debbie Cameron, competed in the 1993 contest as part of the Seebach Band; and Humphrey Campbell, who had represented the in the previous year&#x27;s event, returned as a backing singer for the Dutch entrant Ruth Jacott.


==Production and format==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1993 was produced by the Irish public broadcaster (RTÉ). Liam Miller served as executive producer, Kevin Linehan served as producer, Anita Notaro served as director, Alan Farquharson served as designer, and Noel Kelehan served as musical director, leading the RTÉ Concert Orchestra. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christian Clausen as scrutineer.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks; however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

The results of the 1993 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, between men and women, and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

The 1993 contest was at the time the largest outside broadcast production ever undertaken by RTÉ, and the broadcaster was reported to have spent over on producing the event. In order to stage the event Millstreet and the Green Glens Arena underwent major infrastructure improvements, which were led by local groups and individuals. The floor area within the arena had to be dug out in order to create additional height to facilitate the stage and equipment, extra phone lines had to be installed, and the town&#x27;s railway line and station required an extension at an extra cost of over .

The stage design for the Millstreet contest featured the largest stage yet constructed for the event, covering 2,500ft² (232m²) of translucent material which was illuminated from below by lighting strips. A mirror image of the triangular shaped stage was suspended from above, and a slanted background created a distorted perspective for the viewer. A hidden doorway featured in the centre of the stage, which was used by the presenter at the beginning of the show, and by the winning artist as they re-entered the arena following the broadcast. The contest logo, which was publicly presented in February 1993, was designed by Conor Cassidy and was adapted from aspects of the coat of arms of County Cork.

Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 10 May 1993. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals were held on 10 and 11 May, consisting of a 15-minute stage-call for the setting up of the stage with instruments and equipment and to brief the orchestra, followed by a 25-minute rehearsal, with the second rehearsals held on 12 and 13 May comprising a 10-minute stage call and 20-minute rehearsal. Following each first rehearsal, there was an opportunity for delegates to review their rehearsals on video monitors, as well as to take part in a 25-minute press conference. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 14 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 15 May. An audience was present for the second dress rehearsal on the evening of 14 May, which was highly attended by the local population of Millstreet.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 15 May 1993 at 20:00 (IST) and lasted 3 hours and 1 minute. The show was presented by the Irish journalist Fionnuala Sweeney.

The contest was opened by an animated sequence designed by Gary Keenan and inspired by Celtic mythology, set to Irish traditional music by composers Ronan Johnston and Shea Fitzgerald and featuring uilleann pipes player Davy Spillane. The interval act comprised performances by previous Eurovision winners Linda Martin, reprising her winning song from the &quot;Why Me?&quot;, and Johnny Logan, performing the song &quot;Voices (Are Calling)&quot; with choirs from the Cork School of Music and local children of Millstreet. The trophy awarded to the winners was crafted by Waterford Crystal and was presented by Linda Martin.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, written by Jimmy Walsh and performed by Niamh Kavanagh. This marked Ireland&#x27;s fifth contest win, putting them level with and for the country with the most wins, and its second win in a row, matching the same feat previously achieved by ( and ), Luxembourg ( and ) and ( and ). The finished in second place for the second year in a row, and for a record-extending fourteenth time overall.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1993 contest are listed below.

* Olivier Minne
* Eileen Dunne
* Kevin Drake
* Gösta Hanson
* Colin Berry

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. However, due to a technical problem with the telephone connection, Malta, which had been scheduled to be the eighth country to vote, was passed over and instead voted last. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

=== 12 points ===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Ireland received the maximum score of 12 points from seven of the voting countries, with the United Kingdom receiving four sets of 12 points, Norway and Switzerland receiving three sets of maximum scores each, France and Portugal two sets each, and Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece and the Netherlands each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue. The contest reportedly received an estimated global audience of 300 to 500 million television viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<doc id="184956" wikidata="Q965335" url="?curid=184956" title="Charles, Duc de Morny">
<text>Charles Auguste Louis Joseph de Morny, 1st Duc de Morny (; 15/16 September 181110 March 1865) was a French statesman.

==Biography==
Morny was born in Switzerland, and was the extra-marital son of Hortense de Beauharnais (the wife of Louis Bonaparte and queen of Holland) and Charles Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, making him half-brother of Emperor Napoleon III and grandson of Talleyrand. His birth was duly registered in a misleading certificate, which made him the legitimate son of Auguste Jean Hyacinthe Demorny, and born in Paris on 23 October 1811, and described as a landowner of Saint-Domingue. M. Demorny was in fact an officer in the Prussian army and a native of the French colony of St. Domingue (now Haiti), though he owned no land there or elsewhere.

Morny was educated by his grandmother, Adelaïde Filleul. After a brilliant school and college career the future duc de Morny received a commission in the army, and the next year he entered the staff college. The comte de Morny, as he was called by a polite fiction, served in Algeria in 1834–1835 (during the French conquest of Algeria) as aide-de-camp to General Camille Alphonse Trezel, whose life he saved under the walls of Constantine.

When Morny returned to Paris in 1838, he secured a solid position in the business world by establishing a major beet-sugar industry at Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne and by writing a pamphlet &quot;Sur la question des sucres&quot; in 1838. In these and other lucrative speculations he was helped by his mistress Françoise Mosselman, the beautiful and wealthy wife of the Belgian ambassador, Charles Aimé Joseph Le Hon, Comte Le Hon. Eventually there were few great commercial enterprises in Paris in which he did not have an interest.

Although Morny sat as deputy for Clermont-Ferrand from 1842 onwards, he took at first no important part in party politics, but he was heard with respect on industrial and financial questions. He supported the government of Louis Philippe, because revolution threatened his commercial interests, but before the Revolutions of 1848, by which he was temporarily ruined, he considered converting to the Bourbon legitimist cause represented by the Comte de Chambord. His attitude was expressed by the witticism with which he is said to have replied to a lady who asked what he would do if the Chamber were &quot;swept out.&quot; &quot;Range myself on the side of the broom handle,&quot; was his answer. Presently he was admitted to the intimate circle of his half-brother Louis Napoleon, and he helped to engineer the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December 1851 on the morrow of which he was appointed to head the ministry of the interior.

After six months in office, during which Morny showed his political opponents moderation and tact, he resigned his portfolio, ostensibly because he disapproved of the confiscation of the Bourbon-Orléans property but really because Napoleon, influenced by Morny&#x27;s rivals, resented his claim to a foremost place in the government as a member of the House of Bonaparte. He then resumed his financial speculations. When in 1854 the Emperor appointed him president of the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot;, a position which he filled for the rest of his life, he used his official rank to assist his schemes.

In 1856, Morny was sent as special envoy to the coronation of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and brought home a wife, Princess Sophie Troubetzkoi, who through her connections greatly strengthened his social position. Sophie was legally daughter of Prince Sergey Vasilyevich Trubetskoy, but may have been the illegitimate daughter of Nicholas I of Russia. In 1862, Morny was created a Duke. It is said that he aspired to the throne of Mexico, and that the French expedition sent to place Archduke Maximilian on the throne was prompted by Napoleon III&#x27;s desire to thwart this ambition.
In spite of occasional disagreements, Morny&#x27;s influence with the emperor remained great, and the liberal policies which he advocated enabled him to serve the imperial cause through his influence with the leaders of the opposition, the most conspicuous of whom, Émile Ollivier, was detached from his colleagues by Morny&#x27;s efforts. But while he was laying the foundations of the &quot;Liberal Empire&quot; his health deteriorated and was further injured by quack medicines. The emperor and the empress visited him just before his death in Paris on 10 March 1865.

Morny&#x27;s valuable collection of pictures, including Jean-Honoré Fragonard&#x27;s &quot;The Swing&quot;, was sold after his death. In spite of his undoubted wit and social gifts, Morny failed to secure the distinction he desired as a dramatist, and none of his pieces, which appeared under the pseudonym of M. de St Rémy, including &quot;Sur la grande route&quot;, &quot;M. Choufleuri restera chez lui le . . .&quot;, and the &quot;Les finesses du mari&quot;, among others, met with success on the stage.

M. de Chenneviėres, the director of the Beaux-Arts, admired Morny&#x27;s taste in pictures as well as the man himself. Charles de Morny was, he opined,&quot;the most perfectly polite, the most elegant, the best bred man of his time&quot;.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
Morny played an important role in the development of the thoroughbred horse racing and breeding industry in France. In 1860, he purchased the English Triple Crown champion West Australian and brought him to France for breeding purposes. In 1862 Morny built the Deauville-La Touques Race Course near Deauville. The Prix Morny is named in his honour.
==Family==

He had married at Saint Petersburg on 7 January 1857, Princess Sofia Sergeyevna Trubetskaya (Moscow, 25 March 18368 August 1898), the only daughter of Prince Sergey Vasilyevich Trubetskoy (181412 May (30 April Old Style), 1859) and his wife Ekaterina Petrovna Mussina-Pushkina (1 February 1816). Their children included:
* Marie Eugenie de Morny (1857–1883), who married a Spanish noble, José Ramón Gil Francisco de Borja Nicolás Osório y de Heredia, 9th Conde de La Corzana (1854–1919), in 1877 in Madrid, and had a son:
** José Osorio y de Morny (Madrid, 1878Madrid, 1905). He married María de la Purificación Dorticos-Marín y León, Marquesa de Marín (1878–1928), in 1902 in Madrid. He had children.
* Auguste Charles Louis Valentin de Morny (1859–1920), who succeeded his father as the 2nd Duc de Morny. He married Carlota de Guzmán-Blanco y de Ybarra (Caracas, 1869Courbevoie, 1939) in 1886 in Paris and had three children:
** Auguste de Morny, 3rd Duc de Morny (1889–1935), unmarried and without issue.
** Antoine de Morny, 4th Duc de Morny (1896–1943), unmarried and without issue.
**
** Anna Teresa de Morny (1890–1924), unmarried and without issue.
* Serge de Morny (1861–1922), who died unmarried and without issue. 
* Sophie &quot;Mathilde&quot; (&quot;Missy&quot;) de Morny (1863–1944), who married Jacques Godart, 6th Marquis de Belbeuf (1850–1906) in 1881 in Madrid and divorced him in 1903; without issue.

He also had an illegitimate daughter by Fanny Mosselman, who was referred by Balzac.
* Leopoldina Louise le Hon (ca. 1840-1931) married the Polish prince Stanislas-Auguste Poniatowski, of the Royal House of Poniatowski, and had children. Louise has living descendants.

==Theatrical interests==
De Morny was influential in the early career of Sarah Bernhardt, who played for Alexander Dumas and Victor Hugo. In her autobiography, &quot;My Double Life&quot;, Bernhardt recounts that at a family conference which de Morny attended as a family friend, the purpose of which was to determine what Bernhardt was to do with her future life, de Morny suggested that she be sent to the Conservatoire. The family took him up on the suggestion and her life turned to the theatre.

<text>Jesica Santillan (December 26, 1985 – February 22, 2003) was a Mexican national who died after an organ transplant operation in which she received the heart and lungs of a patient whose blood type did not match hers. Doctors at the Duke University Medical Center failed to check the compatibility before surgery began.

Jesica, two siblings, her mother Magdelena Santillan and her mother&#x27;s boyfriend Melecio Huerta illegally entered the United States from Tamazula, Mexico, a town 275 miles west of Mexico City, so that she could receive medical treatment. Relatives have stated that the family paid a coyote to get them across the border. During the journey, thieves stole all of the family&#x27;s money, including Jesica&#x27;s earrings. The family settled in Durham, North Carolina near Duke University Hospital and successfully raised money for the transplant operation with the help of Mack Mahoney, a local businessman.

== Operation ==
Jesica, whose blood was type O-positive, had a heart condition (restrictive cardiomyopathy and secondary nonreactive pulmonary hypertension), that resulted in reduced blood perfusion in her lungs. On February 7, 2003, she received the heart and lung transplant at Duke University Hospital. The new organs had been flown in from Boston. James Jaggers, Santillan&#x27;s transplant surgeon found that blood test results proving that the organ blood type (type A) and Jesica&#x27;s blood type (O-Positive) did not match just as the surgery was ending.

The procedures that should have prevented such a mistake broke down twice: Dr. James Jaggers, Jesica&#x27;s surgeon, failed to check the compatibility, assuming that the blood type of the donated organs matched Jesica&#x27;s. He also failed to verbally confirm that assumption with Carolina Donor Services, the donor agency.

Upon discovery of the error, the transplant team used immunosuppressant drugs and plasmapheresis to prevent immediate organ rejection. The patient was kept on life support after the operation as donor for a second transplant was sought, even as she was racked by a series of seizures and her new organs started to fail. She also suffered from kidney failure as a result of the mismatch.

On February 20, Jesica received a new heart and set of lungs after a new donor was found late on February 19, 2003. However, the trauma of immune rejection had caused irreversible brain damage, and on February 21, she was declared brain dead. Her family was approached by the hospital to determine if her salvageable organs could be donated for use in other transplant patients. On the advice of their attorneys, the family declined. She was 17.

Subsequently, Mahoney, Jesica&#x27;s benefactor, had to fight the hospital to get it to admit to the mistake, and according to him Duke officials misled the Santillans, who barely spoke English, about the gravity of Jesica&#x27;s situation.

In 2004, Duke settled with the Santillan family.

== Jesica&#x27;s Hope Chest ==
Jesica&#x27;s Hope Chest is a charity that Mack Mahoney named after her. It receives donations for houses which then go to families who have at least one heart patient. 

Ten years after Santillan&#x27;s death, allegations surfaced that money for the charity was being misappropriated.

<doc id="184959" wikidata="Q695566" url="?curid=184959" title="Panic of 1873">
<text>The Panic of 1873 was a financial crisis that triggered an economic depression in Europe and North America that lasted from 1873 to 1877 or 1879 in France and in Britain. In Britain, the Panic started two decades of stagnation known as the &quot;Long Depression&quot; that weakened the country&#x27;s economic leadership. In the United States, the Panic was known as the &quot;Great Depression&quot; until the events of 1929 and the early 1930s set a new standard.

The Panic of 1873 and the subsequent depression had several underlying causes for which economic historians debate the relative importance. American inflation, rampant speculative investments (overwhelmingly in railroads), the demonetization of silver in Germany and the United States, ripples from economic dislocation in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), and major property losses in the Great Chicago Fire (1871) and the Great Boston Fire (1872) helped to place massive strain on bank reserves, which, in New York City, plummeted from $50 million to $17 million between September and October 1873.

The first symptoms of the crisis were financial failures in Vienna, the capital of Austria-Hungary, which spread to most of Europe and to North America by 1873.

==Europe==
The panic and depression hit all of the industrial nations.

===Germany and Austria-Hungary===
A similar process of overexpansion took place in Germany and Austria-Hungary, where the period from German unification in 1870 and 1871 to the crash in 1873 came to be called the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Founders&#x27; Years&quot;). A liberalized incorporation law in Germany gave impetus to the foundation of new enterprises, such as , and the incorporation of established ones. Euphoria over the military victory against France in 1871 and the influx of capital from the payment by France of war reparations fueled stock market speculation in railways, factories, docks, steamships; the same industrial branches that expanded unsustainably in the United States. In the immediate aftermath of his victory against France, Bismarck began the process of silver demonetization. The process began on 23 November 1871 and culminated in the introduction of the gold mark on 9 July 1873 as the currency for the newly united Reich, replacing the silver coins of all constituent lands. Germany was now on the gold standard. Demonetization of silver was thus a common element in the crises on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

On 9 May 1873, the Vienna Stock Exchange crashed since it was unable to sustain the bubble of false expansion, insolvencies, and dishonest manipulations. A series of Viennese bank failures ensued, causing a contraction of the money available for business lending. One of the more famous private individuals who went bankrupt in 1873 was Stephan Keglevich of Vienna, a relative of Gábor Keglevich, who had been the master of the royal treasury (1842–1848) and in 1845 had cofounded a financial association to fund the expansion of Hungarian industry and to protect the loan repayments, similar to the 1870 &quot;Kreditschutzverband&quot;, an Austrian association for the protection of creditors and the interests of its members in cases of bankruptcy. That made it possible for a number of new Austrian banks to be established in 1873 after the Vienna Stock Exchange crash.

In Berlin, the railway empire of Bethel Henry Strousberg crashed after a ruinous settlement with the government of Romania, bursting the speculation bubble in Germany. The contraction of the German economy was exacerbated by the conclusion of war reparations payments to Germany by France in September 1873. Two years after the foundation of the German Empire, the panic came and became known as the &quot;&quot; or &quot;Founders&#x27; Crash&quot;. In 1865, Keglevich and Strousberg had come into direct competition in a project in what is now Slovakia. In 1870 the Hungarian government, and in 1872 the Emperor-King Franz Joseph of Austria, resolved the question of the competing projects.

Although the collapse of the foreign loan financing had been predicted, the events of that year were in themselves comparatively unimportant. Buda, the old capital of Hungary, and Óbuda were officially united with Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest in 1873. The difference in stability between Vienna and Berlin had the effect that the French indemnity to Germany flowed into Austria and Russia, but the indemnity payments aggravated the crisis in Austria, which had benefited by the accumulation of capital not only in Germany but also in England, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Russia.

Recovery from the crash occurred much more quickly in Europe than in the United States. Moreover, German businesses managed to avoid the sort of deep wage cuts that embittered American labor relations. There was an anti-Semitic component to the economic recovery in Germany and Austria, as small investors blamed Jews for their losses in the crash. The &quot;Neuer Sozial-Demokrat&quot; newspaper of the ADAV published several articles blaming Gerson von Bleichröder for the stock market crash. An October 29 article called Bleichröder &quot;Bismarck&#x27;s Jew&quot;.

Soon, more luxury hotels and villas were built in Opatija, and a new railway line was extended in 1873 from the Vienna–Trieste line to Rijeka (Fiume), making it possible to go by tram from there to Opatija. The strong increase of port traffic generated a permanent demand for expansion. The Suez Canal was opened in 1869. 1875–1890 became &quot;the golden years&quot; of Giovanni de Ciotta in Rijeka.

The crash is central in the 1877 novel &quot;The Breaking of the Storm&quot; by the German writer Friedrich Spielhagen. A portrayal of German business life in the 1870s, the literary scholar Jeffrey L. Sammons has described it as &quot;the major fictional treatment of the financial crash of the 1870s as a harbringer of the predatory but erratic capitalism that was to become characteristic of the Reich&quot;.

===Britain===
The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 was one of the causes of the Panic of 1873 because goods from the Far East had been carried in sailing vessels around the Cape of Good Hope and were stored in British warehouses. As sailing vessels were not adaptable for use through the Suez Canal (because the prevailing winds of the Mediterranean Sea blow from west to east), the British entrepôt trade suffered.

When the crisis came, the Bank of England raised interest rates to 9 percent. Despite this, Britain did not experience the scale of financial mayhem seen in America and Central Europe, perhaps forestalled by an expectation that the liquidity-constraining provisions of the Bank Charter Act 1844 would be suspended as they had been in the crises of 1847, 1857, and 1866. The ensuing economic downturn in Britain seems to have been muted – &quot;stagnant&quot; but without a &quot;decline in aggregate output&quot;. However, there was heavy unemployment in the basic industries of coal, iron and steel, engineering, and shipbuilding, especially in 1873, 1886, and 1893.

====Comparison with Germany====
From 1873 to 1896, a period sometimes referred to as the Long Depression, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations were able to reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates with industrial production increasing by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates in both countries helps to account for the different industrial growth rates. During the depression, the British ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0%, but the German ratio rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. During the depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment, but Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment of social overhead capital, such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, thereby stimulating industrial demand in that country, but similar investment stagnated or decreased in Britain. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production in the two countries and the different growth rates during and after the depression.

===India===
The discovery of large quantities of silver in the United States and several European colonies caused the panic of 1873 and thus a decline in the value of silver relative to gold, devaluing India&#x27;s standard currency. This event was known as &quot;the fall of the rupee&quot;.

===South Africa===
In the Cape Colony, the panic caused bankruptcies, rising unemployment, a pause in public works, and a major trade slump that lasted until the discovery of gold in 1886.

===Ottoman Empire===
In the periphery, the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s economy also suffered. Rates of growth of foreign trade dropped, external terms of trade deteriorated, declining wheat prices affected peasant producers, and the establishment of European control over Ottoman finances led to large debt payments abroad. The growth rates of agricultural and aggregate production were also lower during the Long Depression than the later period.

===Latin Monetary Union===
The general demonetization and cheapening of silver caused the Latin Monetary Union in 1873 to suspend the conversion of silver to coins.

==United States==
===Factors===
The American Civil War (1861–1865) was followed by a boom in railroad construction. of new track were laid across the country between 1868 and 1873, with much of the craze in railroad investment being driven by government land grants and subsidies to the railroads. The railroad industry was the largest employer outside agriculture in the US and involved large amounts of money and risk. A large infusion of cash from speculators caused spectacular growth in the industry and in the construction of docks, factories, and ancillary facilities. Most capital was involved in projects offering no immediate or early returns.

===Coinage Act of 1873===
A period of economic overexpansion arose from the northern railroad boom before a series of economic setbacks: the Black Friday panic of 1869, the Chicago fire of 1871, an outbreak of equine influenza and the Boston fire of 1872, and the demonetization of silver in 1873.

The decision of the German Empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and downward pressure on the value of silver, which, in turn, affected the US since much of the supply of silver was mined there. As a result, the US Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1873, which changed the national silver policy.

Before the Act, the US had backed its currency with both gold and silver and minted both types of coins. The Act moved the United States to a &quot;de facto&quot; gold standard, which meant it would no longer buy silver at a statutory price or convert silver from the public into silver coins, but it would still mint silver dollars for export in the form of trade dollars.

The Act had the immediate effect of depressing silver prices, hurting Western mining interests, who labeled the Act &quot;The Crime of &#x27;73&quot;, but its effect was offset somewhat by the introduction of a silver trade dollar for use in Asia and the discovery of new silver deposits at Virginia City, Nevada, that resulted in new investment in mining activity. The Act also reduced the domestic money supply, raising interest rates and hurting farmers and others who normally carried heavy debt loads. The resulting outcry raised serious questions about how long the new policy would last. The perception of US instability in its monetary policy caused investors to shy away from long-term obligations, particularly long-term bonds. The problem was compounded by the railroad boom, which was then in its later stages.

In September 1873, the US economy entered a crisis.

====Jay Cooke &amp; Company fails====
In September 1873, Jay Cooke &amp; Company, a major component of the country&#x27;s banking establishment, found itself unable to market several million dollars in Northern Pacific Railway bonds. Jay Cooke&#x27;s firm, like many others, had invested heavily in the railroads. Some investment banks were then anxious for more capital for their enterprises, US President Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s monetary policy of contracting the money supply and thus raising interest rates made matters worse for those in debt. Businesses were expanding, but the money they needed to finance that growth was becoming scarcer.

Cooke and other entrepreneurs had planned to build the second transcontinental railroad, the Northern Pacific Railway. Cooke&#x27;s firm provided the financing, and ground for the line was broken near Duluth, Minnesota, on 15 February 1870. The railroad had borrowed more than $1.5 million from Cooke &amp; Co, but was incapable of paying it back. An expanding funding gap became harder to resolve due to the Credit Mobilier scandal. Due to the financial crises in Europe, Cooke could not sell the securities abroad. Just as Cooke was about to swing a $300 million government loan in September 1873, reports circulated that his firm&#x27;s credit had become nearly worthless. On 18 September, the firm declared bankruptcy.

====Insurance industry====
Many US insurance companies went out of business, as the deteriorating financial conditions created solvency problems for life insurers. The common factor of the surviving companies was that all marketed tontines.

===Effects===

The failure of Jay Cooke&#x27;s bank and soon afterward of Henry Clews&#x27; set off a chain reaction of bank failures and temporarily closed the New York Stock Exchange. Factories began to lay off workers as the country slipped into depression. The effects of the panic were quickly felt in New York (where 25% of workers became unemployed) and more slowly in Chicago, Virginia City, Nevada (where silver mining was active), and San Francisco. In New Hampshire, state coffers were so depleted by lost tax revenue the state government turned to private interests including tea and gunpowder manufacturer D. Ralph Lolbert for financial support.

The New York Stock Exchange closed for ten days starting on 20 September. By November 1873, some 55 of the nation&#x27;s railroads had failed, and another 60 had gone bankrupt by the first anniversary of the crisis. Construction of new rail lines, formerly one of the backbones of the economy, plummeted from of track in 1872 to just in 1875, and 18,000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875. Unemployment peaked in 1878 at 8.25%. Building construction was halted, wages were cut, real estate values fell, and corporate profits vanished.

In 1874, Congress passed &quot;the Ferry Bill&quot; to allow for the printing of currency, increasing inflation and reducing the value of debts. The bill was vetoed by President Grant. The following year, Congress passed the Specie Resumption Act of 1875, which would back United States currency with gold. Backing American currency with gold helped curb inflation and stabilize the dollar.

===Railroad strike===
The railroad industry in the United States had seen major growth in the decades before 1873, driven in part by strong European interest in bonds issued by railroad companies. The failure of Jay Cooke &amp; Co., heavily invested in railroad bonds, triggered a crisis in the railroad industry.

In 1877, steep wage cuts led American railroad workers to launch the series of protests and riots later dubbed Great Railroad Strike. Initial protests broke out in Martinsburg, West Virginia, after the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) cut workers&#x27; pay for the third time in a year. West Virginia Governor Henry M. Mathews sent the militia, under Colonel Charles J. Faulkner, to restore order but was unsuccessful, largely because the militia sympathized with the workers. The governor called on US President Rutherford B. Hayes for federal assistance, and Hayes dispatched federal troops. That restored peace to Martinsburg but proved controversial, with many newspapers critical of Mathews&#x27; characterization of the strikes as an &quot;insurrection&quot;, rather than an act of desperation and frustration. The &quot;Martinsburg Statesman&quot; recorded a striking worker&#x27;s perspective that he &quot;might as well die by the bullet as to starve to death by inches&quot;.

Within a week, similar protests had erupted in other cities. In Baltimore, Maryland where strikers set fire to buildings owned by B.&amp; O. Railroads and an outnumbered militia guard division opened fire when they were surrounded by rioters, killing 10 and injuring 25 more leading to a days-long standoff at Camden Yards.

In New York, striking workers began pelting arriving trains with thrown objects, prompting a response from local police. Pennsylvania saw perhaps the worst violence of the railroad strikes; see Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877, Reading Railroad massacre and Scranton general strike. In Chicago, Illinois, striking workers brought freight and passenger trains to a standstill, leading to an order from judge Thomas Drummond that such actions were illegal. The United States Marshals Service responded by arresting dozens of strikers. In Missouri, strikers also brought rail traffic to a halt, and at least 18 people died in conflicts.

In July 1877, the market for lumber crashed, leading several Michigan lumber companies to go bankrupt. Within a year, the effects of this second business slump reached all the way to California.

===Aftermath in the United States===

The depression ended in the spring of 1879, but tension between workers and the leaders of banking and manufacturing interests lingered on.

Poor economic conditions also caused voters to turn against the Republican Party. In the 1874 congressional elections, the Democratic Party assumed control of the House for the first time since the Civil War.

Public opinion made it difficult for the Grant administration to develop a coherent policy on the Southern states, and the North began to steer away from Reconstruction. With the depression, ambitious railroad building programs crashed across the South, leaving most states deep in debt and burdened with heavy taxes. Retrenchment was a common response of the South to state debts during the depression. One by one, each state fell to the Democrats in the South, and the Republicans lost power.

The end of the crisis coincided with the beginning of the great wave of immigration to the United States, which lasted until the early 1920s.

==Global protectionism==
After the 1873 depression, agricultural and industrial groups lobbied for protective tariffs. Conservative politicians such as Otto von Bismarck shifted from classical liberal economic policies in the 1870s, embracing many economic interventionist policies, including high tariffs, nationalization of railroads, and compulsory social insurance. The political and economic nationalism also reduced the fortunes of the German and Canadian classical liberal parties. France, like Britain, also entered into a prolonged stagnation that extended to 1897. The French also attempted to deal with their economic problems by the implementation of tariffs. New French laws in 1880 and in 1892 imposed stiff tariffs on many agricultural and industrial imports. The U.S., still in the period after the Civil War, continued to be very protectionist.

<text>Sintra (, ) is a town and municipality in the Greater Lisbon region of Portugal, located on the Portuguese Riviera. The population of the municipality in 2021 was 385,654, in an area of . Sintra is one of the most urbanized and densely populated municipalities of Portugal. A major tourist destination famed for its picturesqueness, the municipality has several historic palaces, castles, scenic beaches, parks and gardens.

The area includes the Sintra-Cascais Nature Park through which the Sintra Mountains run. The historic center of the &quot;Vila de Sintra&quot; is famous for its 19th-century Romanticist architecture, historic estates and villas, gardens, and royal palaces and castles, which resulted in the classification of the town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sintra&#x27;s landmarks include the medieval Castle of the Moors, the romanticist Pena National Palace and the Portuguese Renaissance Sintra National Palace.

Sintra is one of the wealthiest municipalities in both Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula as a whole. It is home to one of the largest foreign expatriate communities along the Portuguese Riviera, and consistently ranks as one of the best places to live in Portugal. The ECB Forum on Central Banking, an annual event organised by the European Central Bank, is held in Sintra.

== History ==

===Prehistory to Moorish era===
The earliest remnants of human occupation were discovered in Penha Verde: these vestiges testify to an occupation dating to the early Paleolithic. Comparable remnants were discovered in an open-air site in São Pedro de Canaferrim, alongside the chapel of the Castelo dos Mouros (&quot;Moorish Castle&quot;), dating back to the Neolithic, and include decorated ceramics and microlithic flint utensils from the 5th millennium BC.

Ceramic fragments found locally including many late Chalcolithic vases from the Sintra mountains suggest that between the fourth and third millennia B.C. the region (adjacent to the present village of Sintra) was occupied by a Neolithic/Chalcolithic settlement, with characteristics comparable to fortified settlements in Lisbon and Setúbal. The evidence discovered in Quinta das Sequoias and São Pedro de Canaferrim contrasts dramatically with those remnants discovered in the walled town of Penha Verde and the funerary monument of Bella Vista. Traces of several Bronze Age remains were also discovered in many places in the Sintra Mountains, including alongside the town, in the Monte do Sereno area, and a late Bronze Age settlement within the Moorish Castle dating to the 9th–6th centuries B.C.

The most famous object from this period is the so-called Sintra Collar, a middle Bronze Age gold neck-ring found near the city at the end of the 19th century, which since 1900 has been part of the British Museum&#x27;s collection. Relatively close by, in Santa Eufémia da Serra, is an Iron Age settlement where artifacts from indigenous tribes and peoples of Mediterranean origins (principally from the Punic period) were also discovered.

These date from the early 4th century B.C., prior to the Romanization of the peninsula, which in the area of Foz do Tejo took place in the middle of the 2nd century B.C. Close proximity to a large commercial centre (Olisipo) founded by the Turduli Oppidani people in the first half of the first millennium B.C., meant that the region of Sintra was influenced by human settlement throughout various epochs, cultures that have left remains in the area to this day. The toponym &quot;Sintra&quot; derives from the medieval &quot;Suntria&quot;, and points to an association with radical Indo-European cultures; the word translates as &#x27;bright star&#x27; or &#x27;sun&#x27;, commonly significant in those cultures. Marcus Terentius Varro and Cadizian Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella designated the place &quot;the sacred mountain&quot; and Ptolemy referred to it as the &quot;mountains of the moon&quot;.

During the Roman occupation of the peninsula, the region of Sintra was part of the vast &quot;Civitas Olisiponense&quot; which Caesar (around 49 B.C.) or more likely Octavius (around 30 B.C.) granted the status of &quot;Municipium Civium Romanorum&quot;. The various residents of the region were considered part of the &quot;Roman Galeria&quot; and in the present village of Sintra there are Roman remains testifying to a Roman presence from the 1st–2nd centuries B.C. to the 5th century A.D. A roadway along the southeast part of the Sintra Mountains and connected to the main road to Olisipo dates from this period.

This &quot;via&quot; followed the route of the current &quot;Rua da Ferraria&quot;, the &quot;Calçada dos Clérigos&quot; and the &quot;Calçada da Trindade&quot;. Following the Roman custom of siting tombs along their roads and near their homes, there is also evidence of inscriptions pertaining to Roman funeral monuments, dating mainly to the 2nd century. The area around the modern town of Sintra, due to its proximity to Olisipo, the ancient name of Lisbon, was always profoundly interconnected with the major settlement, to the point that the Fountain of Armés, a 1st-century fountain in the village of Armés, Terrugem, in Sintra, has been built by Lucius Iulius Maelo Caudicus, an Olisipo flamen, to honour the Roman Emperor Augustus.

It was during the Moorish occupation of Sintra () that Greco-Latin writers wrote of the explicit occupation of the area of the town centre. A description by the geographer Al-Bacr, described Sintra as &quot;one of the towns that [are] dependent on Lisbon in Al-Andalus, in proximity to the sea&quot;, characterizing it as &quot;permanently submersed in a fog that never dissipates&quot;.

During the Reconquista (around the 9th century), its principal centre and castle were isolated by Christian armies. Following the fall of the Caliphate of Córdoba, the King of León, Alfonso VI received in the spring of 1093, the cities of Santarém, Lisbon and the Castle of Sintra. This followed a period of internal instability within the Muslim taifas of the peninsula, and in particular the decision by the ruler of Taifa of Badajoz, Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mutawakkil who, after hesitating from 1090 to 1091, placed his territory under the suzerainty of Alfonso VI when faced with the threat of the Almoravids. Afonso took the cities and the castle of Sintra between 30 April and 8 May 1093, but shortly after their transfer Sintra and Lisbon were conquered by the Almoravids. Santarém was saved by Henry, who Alfonso had nominated Count of Portugal in 1096, to replace Raymond of Burgundy.

===Kingdom===
In July 1109, Count Henry reconquered the Castle of Sintra. This was preceded a year before by an attempt by Prince Sigurd the Crusader, son of Magnus III of Norway, to capture the castle from the Moors in the course of his trek to the Holy Land. Sigurd&#x27;s forces disembarked at the mouth of the Colares River but failed to take the castle. But it was only after the conquest of Lisbon, in October 1147, by Afonso Henriques (supported by Crusaders), that the castle surrendered definitively to the Christians, in November. It was integrated into Christian dominions along with Almada and Palmela after their surrender. Afonso Henriques established the Church of São Pedro de Canaferrim within the walls of the Moorish Castle to mark his success.

On 9 January 1154, Afonso Henriques signed a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) for the town of Sintra, with all its respective regalia. The charter established the municipality of Sintra, whose territory encompassed a large area, eventually divided into four great parishes: São Pedro de Canaferrim (in the castle), São Martinho (in the town of Sintra), Santa Maria and São Miguel (in the ecclesiastical seat of Arrabalde). The early municipal seat, the town of Sintra, was the centre of a significant Sephardic community, with a synagogue and quarter. This community was not limited to Sintra town: enclaves are mentioned during the reign of King Denis in Colares, but were heavily pressured by the influx of Christian serfs. Throughout the 12th and 13th centuries, owing to the fertility of the land, various convents, monasteries and military orders constructed residences, estates, water-mills and vineyards. There are municipal records from this period of a number of donations and grants; between 1157 and 1158, Afonso Henriques donated to the master of the Knights Templar, Gualdim Pais, various houses and estates in the centre of Sintra.

In 1210, the Monastery of Santa Cruz in Coimbra acquired four houses in Pocilgais, releasing them in 1230, while in 1264 it controlled homes and vineyards in Almargem. In 1216 the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora (Lisbon) also held a vineyard in Colares and, in 1218, estates in Queluz and Barota. At some time between 1223 and 1245, the Monastery of Santa Maria de Alcobaça held various privileges in the territory. The military Order of Santiago owned an estate in Arrifana in 1260. Many of Afonso Henriques&#x27; donations in the 12th century, including privileges assigned to these institutions, were confirmed in 1189 by his son, Sancho I (1185–1211), corresponding to a social, political and economic strategy during the post-Reconquista era. Consequently, after 1261, Sintra had a local administration consisting of an alcalde representing the Crown, and two local judges elected by the public. During the political conflict between King Sancho II (1223–1248) and the Church, the churches of São Pedro and São Martinho, which belonged to the King, were ceded to the Bishop of Lisbon and Sé. Yet the Crown&#x27;s patrimony was defined early: in 1287, King Denis donated to Queen Elizabeth of Portugal the town, the signeurial holdings and all their associated benefits. Later, these lands were transferred to the young Infante Afonso (later King Afonso IV), and remained in his possession until 1334, before reverting to the ownership of the queen ().

The Black Death arrived in Sintra in the 14th century; in 1350, the disease is known to have caused the death of five municipal scribes. Far greater numbers of deaths probably resulted, perhaps owing to the cool climate and humidity, conditions that favoured the rapid spread of the disease.

During the reign of King Ferdinand (1367–1383), Sintra played a part in the controversial marriage of the monarch to Dona Leonor Telles de Menezes. In 1374, the King donated Sintra to the Lady Telles, whom he eventually married in secret in the north of the country. Along with Sintra the King conceded the municipalities of Vila Viçosa, Abrantes and Almada, to the consternation of his private council; following a confrontation the King abandoned his duties and travelled to Sintra, where he remained for a month on the pretext of hunting. As Sintra was located relatively close to Lisbon, many of its people were called to work on projects for the Crown in the capital: in 1373, King Ferdinand decided to wall the city, and requested funds or workers from coastal lands in Almada, Sesimbra, Palmela, Setúbal, Coina, Benavente and Samora Correia, as well as all of Ribatejo, and from the inland areas of Sintra, Cascais, Torres Vedras, Alenquer, Arruda, Atouguia, Lourinhã, Telheiros and Mafra. During the Dynastic Crisis between 1383 and 1385, Sintra joined Leonor Telles in supporting the proclamation of her daughter, Beatrice, who married John I of Castile, as Queen of Portugal and Castile. After the defeat of the Castilian army at Aljubarrota (August 1385) by Portuguese and English troops, commanded by Nuno Álvares Pereira, Sintra became one of the last places to surrender to the Master of Aviz, later King of Portugal (after 1383).

===Joanine and Philippine era===

John I (1385–1433), first King of the second dynasty, broke the tradition of transferring Sintra to the &quot;Casa da Rainha&quot; (Queen&#x27;s property). Probably around 1383, John I granted the lands of Sintra to Count Henrique Manuel de Vilhena, quickly revoking the decision after Henrique took the Infanta&#x27;s side during the dynastic quarrel. Sintra, therefore, continued as a possession of the King, who expanded the local estate. Until the end of the 17th century, the royal palace constituted one of the principal residences and summer estates of the court: it was from here that John decided to conquer Ceuta (1415); King Afonso V was born and died at the palace (1433–1481); and here King John II (1481–1495) was acclaimed sovereign.

In a document issued in 1435 by King Edward (1433–1438), the region was described as: &quot;A land of good air and water and of the Comarcas with an abundance in the sea and land [...] our most loyal city of Lisbon being so near, and being in it sufficient diversions, and the distractions of the mountains and hunting...&quot;.

During the Portuguese Age of Discovery, several people born in Sintra were written into history. In 1443 Gonçalo de Sintra, squire in the House of the Infante Henry, was sent by the prince as captain of a caravel to the coast of Africa. He explored the region near the Ouro River and eventually died there in 1444. Pedro de Sintra and Soeiro da Costa later mapped most of the Atlantic coast of Africa, around the time of Henry&#x27;s death in 1460.

At the end of the 15th century the importance of Sintra on official itineraries led Queen Eleanor of Viseu (wife of King John II), then principal benefactor of the Portuguese &quot;Misericóridas&quot;, to expand her principal institutions in Sintra. The &quot;Hospital e Gafaria do Espírito Santo&quot;, the only remnant of which left standing is a chapel to São Lázaro, was constructed to provide assistance and support to lepers in the region (the chapel still includes the signets of King John, the pelican, and Queen Leonor, the shrimp). In 1545, the hospital was transferred to the administration of the &quot;Santa Casa da Misericórdia&quot; of Sintra which was set up by Queen Catherine of Austria, wife of John III.

King Manuel I (1495–1521) enjoyed spending his summers in Sintra, due to its cool climate and abundance of game; as Damião de Góis, his chronicler noted: &quot;because it is one of the places in Europe that is cooler, and cheerful for whichever King, Prince or Master to pass their time, because, in addition to its good airs, that cross its mountains, called by the older peoples the promontory of the moon, there is here much hunting of deer and other animals, and overall many and many good trout of many type, and in which in all of Hispania there can be found, and many springs of water...&quot;. Between the 15th and 16th century, after travelling to the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon when being considered as heir to the Kingdoms in 1498, the King transformed and enriched the town and its region with several public works. These included the reconstruction of the old Gothic Church of São Martinho and in 1511 the construction of the Monastery of Nossa Senhora da Pena on the highest peak of the Sintra Mountains, which he then transferred to the Order of Saint Jerome. In the second half of the 16th century, Sintra was a centre for courtesans and members of the aristocracy began building estates and farms within the region. In this rural environment, from 1542, the Viceroy of India, D. João de Castro (1500–1548) began residing at Quinta da Penha Verde, where he collected examples of Portuguese culture of the time, including works by celebrated artist Francisco de Holanda. It was during this cultural Renaissance that the marble chancel sculpted between 1529 and 1532 by Nicolau Chanterene for the chapel of the Monastery of Nossa Senhora da Pena was completed, as was the portico of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Ulgueira (1560).

Luís de Camões (1524–1580) referred to the mountains of Sintra in his Os Lusíadas chronicle, as a mythic land ruled by water nymphs. The Renaissance poet Luisa Sigea—Syntrae Aloisiae Sygeae in Paris (1566) and Madrid (1781) referred to Sintra as a &quot;pleasant valley, between cliffs that rise into the heavens...curved in graceful hills among which one can feel the murmur of the waters...[where] everything, in fact, will enchant and perfume the environment with its fragrance and fruit.&quot;

With the death of the Cardinal-King Henry (1578–1580), Philip II of Spain inherited the Kingdom of Portugal, initiating a personal union of the crowns that would last until 1640. During this period, Portuguese political power moved from Sintra to Vila Viçosa, principal centre of the House of Braganza, whose dukes, descendants of John of Portugal, were heirs to the throne of Portugal. Following the decision of the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Tomar in 1581, Phillip as King of Portugal accepted an administration composed of the Portuguese aristocracy. He passed through Sintra around October 1581, visiting the monasteries and churches. It was during this period that cult of Sebastianism, the hope for the return of King Sebastian, came to an end, when several fake &quot;Sebastians&quot; were denounced. In 1585 Mateus Alvares, born on the island of Terceira in the Azores and guardian of the hermitage of São Julio, passed himself off as King Sebastian and created conflict in Sintra, Madra, Rio de Mouro and Ericeira. The Sebastian adventure ended with the hanging of thirty people and the suffering of many more. It was not surprising, therefore, that the visit in 1619 by King Philip IV of Spain (Philip III of Portugal) resulted in many families escaping to the hills. During this union (1580–1640), Sintra was a privileged place for Portuguese &quot;exiles&quot; from the Castilian court; nobles who wished to distance themselves from Spanish nobility would purchase lands in the region, away from court intrigue. At the time of the Restoration, in 1640, the municipality had approximately 4000 residents.

===Brigantine era===

The war with Spain (1640–1668), the affirmation of Mafra during the reign of John V of Portugal (1706–1750) through the construction of the Palace-Convent, and later the construction of Royal Palace of Queluz in 1747 during the reigns of Joseph I (1750–1777) and Maria I (1777–1816), helped diminish royal visits to the region. During this time there were only two documented visits: in 1652 and 1654, respectively the visit of Queen Luísa de Gusmão and King John IV (1640–1656), and the final burial of King Afonso VI.

Alleging the insanity of the King and the incapacity of the heir, the Duke of Cadaval and the Infante Peter led a coup d&#x27;état in 1667 which resulted in the resignation of the Count of Castelo Melhor, Minister of King Afonso VI (1656–1683) and the imprisonment of the monarch. In 1668 the Cortes of Lisbon confirmed the Infante Peter, the king&#x27;s brother, as regent and heir. Afonso VI lived the rest of his life imprisoned, in the Paço da Ribeira (1667–1669), in the Fortress of Saint John the Baptist in Angra, in the Azores (1669–1674) and in the end, with the discovery of a conspiracy to kill the regent, in the Paço da Vila in Sintra (1674–1683).

From the 17th to the 18th centuries, the region was centre of contemplative religious orders who established convents in Sintra. But it remained a place of myths, with a large, mysterious forest and macabre, gloomy spaces. Father Baião, in his &quot;Portugal Cuidadoso&quot; (1724) noted: &quot;Next to the Palace of Sintra was a forest, so thick, that during the day, it cast fear in him who entered it. And [King] D. Sebastian was free from these fears, that he would walk at night, through it, many times for two or three hours.&quot; Starting in the second half of the 18th century and lasting through the 19th century Sintra became known as a nostalgic and mysterious location described by many foreigners. It was the Romantic Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;glorious Eden&quot;; Almeida Garrett&#x27;s &quot;pleasant resort&quot;; Eça de Queirós&#x27;s &quot;nest of lovers [where, in] the romantic foliage, the nobles abandoned themselves in the hands of the poets&quot;; or the place where Richard Strauss saw a garden &quot;comparable to Italy, Sicily, Greece or Egypt, a true garden of Klingsor, and there in the heights, a castle of the Holy Grail&quot;.

The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, meanwhile, caused the destruction of the centre of Sintra as well as a number of deaths, resulting in building and restoration in the second half of the 18th century. Also in the 18th century, the first industrial building was established in the town: the &quot;Fábrica de Estamparia de Rio de Mouro&quot; (Mouro River Stamping Factory) in 1778.

The visit of Queen Maria I in 1787 brought about the restoration and redecoration of a few salons and chambers in the municipal buildings. The great festivities of 1795 to celebrate the baptism of the Infante António, son of John VI, resulted in grand balls at the Palace of Queluz. In 1838 the King-Consort, Ferdinand II bought the Monastery of Nossa Senhora da Pena and a vast adjacent area, commissioning the architect José de Costa e Silva to construct an arch joining the two quarters of the Seteais Palace (owned by the Marquis of Marialva), to commemorate the 1802 visit of the Prince and Princess of Brazil, John and Carlota Joaquina, and the subsequent visit of their son, the absolutist King Miguel, in 1830.

During the third quarter of the 18th century and practically all of the 19th century, foreign travellers and Portuguese aristocrats, fired by Romanticism, rediscovered the magic of Sintra, especially in its exotic landscapes and climate. Their visits led to the establishment of several hotels, one of which, Lawrence&#x27;s, opened in 1764, was still functioning in 2018. In the summer of 1787, William Beckford stayed with the Marquis of Marialva, master of the horse for the kingdom, at his residence of Seteais. At the beginning of the 19th century Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of Prince Regent John, bought the estate and Ramalhão Palace. Between 1791 and 1793, Gerard Devisme constructed a Neo-Gothic mansion on his extensive estate in the Quinta de Monserrate (later known as the Monserrate Palace). Beckford, who remained in Sintra, rented the property from Devisme in 1794. The landscape, covered in fog, also attracted another Englishman, Sir Francis Cook, who occupied the estate, constructing an oriental pavilion.


The Palace of Pena, Sintra&#x27;s exemplary Portuguese Romantic symbol, was initiated by the King-Consort Ferdinand, husband of Queen Maria II (1834–1853), a German-born member of the House of Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha. The palace was built over the remains of the 16th-century monastery of the Order of Saint Jerome, conserving many fundamental aspects, including the church, cloister and a few dependencies. The architecture is eclectic, influenced by many architectural styles, evidence of an era of Romanticism.

The intentional mixture of eclectic styles includes the Neo-Gothic, Neo-Manueline, Neo-Islamic, Neo-Renaissance neo-Islamic, and neo-Manueline styles. Much of this has been evident since a major restoration that was completed prior to 1900.

The design was a project of the Baron von Eschwege and Ferdinand II, to substitute the Sintra National Palace as an alternative to the summer residence in Cascais. After Sintra, the monarchs Louis of Portugal (1861–1889) and Carlos of Portugal (1863–1908) ended their summers with visits to Cascais in the months of September and October.

In 1854, the first contract was signed to construct a rail link between Sintra and Lisbon. A decree signed on 26 June 1855 regulated the contract between the government and Count Claranges Lucotte but was later rescinded in 1861. The connection was finally inaugurated on 2 April 1887.

By the beginning of the 20th century, Sintra was recognized as a summer resort visited by aristocrats and millionaires. Among these, Carvalho Monteiro, owner of a considerable fortune (known as &quot;&quot;Monteiro dos Milhões&quot;) constructed near the main town, on an estate he bought from the Baroness of Regaleira, a luxurious revivalist palacette, based on a Neo-Manueline architecture.

From the second half of the 19th century into the first decades of the 20th century, Sintra also became a privileged place for artists: musicians such as Viana da Mota; composers such as Alfredo Keil, painters like João Cristino da Silva (author of one of the most celebrated canvases of Portuguese Romantic art, &quot;&quot;), writers such as Eça de Queirós or Ramalho Ortigão, all these people lived, worked or got inspiration from Sintra&#x27;s landscapes.

===Republic===
The proclamation of a Portuguese Republic in 1910 transformed the bohemian climate of Sintra. Economic development was now promoted; the potential benefits to the region of growth in agriculture, industry and commerce were promoted to foster development. In 1908 a wine growing zone had been demarcated in Colares. Now a commission was established to monitor the quality of wines and promote their exportation, and in 1914 a commercial association () was set up to manage their concession. Meanwhile, in the name of secular and popular progress, parts of the cultural heritage were destroyed, including the annexes of the medieval village bordering the palace in 1911, while the nave of the Church of the Misericórdia was reduced to the presbytery to allow the road to be widened. The first decades of the 20th century were the time of the fastest urbanization of the town, supported by its rail link to Lisbon and the influx of summer travellers.

During the 1920s damage to culturally important sites led to the creation of institutions to study and protect the vast artistic heritage. The &quot;Instituto Histórico de Sintra&quot; (Historic Institute of Sintra), under the direction of Afonso de Ornelas, played an important part in this period. Archaeological studies resulted in considerable development: in 1927, Félix Alves Pereira rediscovered the Neolithic settlements of Santa Eufémia, and the first publication of the discoveries at the prehistoric monuments of Praia das Maçãs were completed in 1929. From this time until the 1970s, coastal Sintra was becoming a summer destination, resulting in the building of Portuguese summer residences. Many important Portuguese architects developed projects in the area in the first half of the 20th century, including Raul Lino, Norte Júnior and Tertuliano de Lacerda Marques.

These projects benefited town and region, increased tourism and attracted as residents many notable Portuguese: historian Francisco Costa; writer Ferreira de Castro; sculptor Anjos Teixeira; architects Norte Júnior and Raul Lino; painters Eduardo Viana, Mily Possoz and Vieira da Silva; poet Oliva Guerra; composer and maestro Frederico de Freitas; historians Felix Alves Pereira and João Martins da Silva Marques.

In 1944, prior to his arrest, Vichy France Prime Minister Pierre Laval had planned to move to an estate in Sintra, where a house had been leased for him.

The 1949 municipal plan by De Groer was devised to protect the town and its neighbourhood from uncontrolled urbanization, and resulted in the maintenance of an environment comparable to 19th century Sintra. Urban anarchy predominated until the middle of the 1980s in the areas adjacent to the main town of Sintra, resulting in the development of new neighbourhoods.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
The Sintra Mountains, a granite massif ten kilometres long – considered the &quot;Monte da Lua&quot; (&quot;Mountain of the Moon&quot;), or &quot;Promontorium Lunae&quot; by the strong local tradition of astral cults – emerge abruptly between a vast plain to the north and the northern margin of the Tagus River estuary, winding in a serpentine cordillera towards the Atlantic Ocean and Cabo da Roca, the most westerly point of continental Europe.
The São João platform, along the northern flank of the Sintra Mountains, has altitudes between and , while the southern part of the mountains, the Cascais platform, is lower: sloping from to the sea, terminating along the coast, around above sea level. The spectacular relief results from the east–west orientation of the massif&#x27;s axis, its terminus at the coast, and the nature of igneous rocks, which are resistant to erosion. The Eruptive Massif of Sintra (MES) is a dome structure, formed by layers of sedimentary rocks (limestones and sandstones) from the Upper Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods. A metamorphosed igneous intrusion resulted in a narrow halo of metamorphic rocks, but also strongly deformed these sedimentary layers causing a vertical exposure. While in the south there are enclosed sedimentary layers, to the north (around Praia Grande) the massif is steep. The sedimentary formations, until the beginning of the Upper Cretaceous, are deformed by the intrusion which limits the MES to the end the Cretaceous. Radiometric aging of different rocks from the massif has indicated an age between 80 and 75 million years (confirming the installation of the massive Upper Cretaceous).

The geodynamic conditions that controlled the formation of the MES (correlated with the development of the Sines and Monchique Eruptive Massifs) are associated with the progressive northern expansion of the Atlantic Ocean and the consequent opening of the Bay of Biscay. The Bay of Biscay&#x27;s expansion resulted in complex tensions responsible for profound fractures in the Earth&#x27;s crust that were conduits for the ascension of magma. Around 80 million years ago this magma spread across the surface as a superficial crust with a depth of 5 kilometres between sedimentary layers (160 to 9 million years old) that were chemically metamorphosed. Over time the magma chamber cooled and crystallized, resulting in conditions that caused the granular textures that characterize the MES. The weaker sedimentary layers were susceptible to erosion, and their products were deposited around their base. Consequently, the massif likely became exposed during the Paleogenic epoch (30 million years ago), known as the Benfica Complex.

===Climate and biome===

The Mediterranean climate, influenced by the Atlantic and characterized by moderate temperatures and wet winters, is typical of mainland Portugal. Although the climate in the area of Cabo da Roca is close to semi-arid, the Sintra Mountains are considered moderately humid: precipitation in the mountains is higher than in the surrounding areas. The position of the town in the natural landscape of the Sintra Mountains (consisting of an exuberant natural patrimony), is influenced by the existence of a micro-climate. For different reasons (the climate here has been moderated by the Sintra Mountains; the fertility of the soils; and its relative proximity to the Tagus estuary) the region attracted considerable early settlement. Due to its micro-climate, a huge park has developed full of dense foliage with a rich botanical diversity.

The temperate climate and humidity resulting from proximity to the coast favour the growth of a rich mat of forest including Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The Pyrenean oak (&quot;Quercus pyrenaica&quot;) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the cork oak (&quot;Quercus suber&quot;) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (&quot;Quercus faginea&quot;) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (&quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;), common hazel (&quot;Corylus avellana&quot;), common hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;), European holly (&quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;), Portuguese laurel (&quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot;), Bay laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;), strawberry tree (&quot;Arbutus unedo&quot;), laurestine (&quot;Viburnum tinus&quot;), Kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;), and Italian buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus alaternus&quot;). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow narrow-leaf ash (&quot;Fraxinus angustifolia&quot;), Grey willow (&quot;Salix atrocinerea&quot;), European alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;), alder buckthorn (&quot;Frangula alnus&quot;) and black elderberry (&quot;Sambucus nigra&quot;).

Since 1966, the Sintra Mountains have been affected by fires that have destroyed a major part of the original forest, which has been substituted by acacia and other fast-growing exotic species. The forested area of the Sintra mountains is about , of which 26% () is maintained by the State through the &quot;Direcção Geral de Florestas – Núcleo Florestal de Sintra&quot; (&quot;General Directorate of Forests – Sintra Forestry Service&quot;).


===Human geography===
The municipality is administered by 11 civil parish () councils, with local authority to administer services and provide local governance, which are:

* Agualva e Mira-Sintra
* Algueirão–Mem Martins
* Almargem do Bispo, Pêro Pinheiro e Montelavar
* Cacém e São Marcos
* Casal de Cambra
* Colares
* Massamá e Monte Abraão
* Queluz e Belas
* Rio de Mouro
* São João das Lampas e Terrugem
* Sintra (Santa Maria e São Miguel, São Martinho e São Pedro de Penaferrim)
Sintra also has numerous hamlets and villages, including the affluent village of Linhó, Sintra.

Sintra&#x27;s population grew considerably in the late 20th century, rising from about 14% of the Lisbon region to 19%, with the main concentration of resident population found in the important Queluz-Portela corridor, along the southeast corner of the municipality. In this area were concentrated approximately 82% of the municipality&#x27;s population, the most attractive parishes to live in being São Pedro de Penaferrim, Rio de Mouro, Belas and Algueirão-Mem Martins.

With the decrease in mortality rates, the region has undergone a general increase in infant births, primarily associated with late births, but also an increase in seniors in the community (56.5% in 2001). Yet Sintra is still considered to have a structurally young population, the youngest in the Greater Metropolitan Area of Lisbon. Young adults (30- to 39-year-olds) dominate Sintra&#x27;s communities, with the parishes of Pêro Pinheiro, Terrugem, São Martinho, São João das Lampas, Santa Maria e São Miguel, Montelavar, Colares, Queluz and Almargem do Bispo all having higher rates of seniors in the population. Approximately 80% of the population are born outside the town, 21% of these being foreign born residents. While the resident population in Lisbon has seen a gentle decrease since the mid-1960s, Sintra has grown comparably.

Urban areas represent of the municipality, or approximately 17.4% of Sintra&#x27;s territory; 35% of the population reside in places of between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. Many of these areas are anchored to lines of access, in particular, the &quot;Sintra Line&quot; and the IC19 motorway which connects the principal towns of Queluz, Agualva-Cacém, Algueirão/Mem Martins, Rio de Mouro and Belas). Many of these urban areas are composed of a fabric of building projects that have historically resulted in dense buildings of concrete, normally seven or more floors in height. The greatest growth in residential homes has occurred in the south of the municipality, in the triangle of São Pedro de Penaferrim, Santa Maria e São Miguel and Casal de Cambra. In addition, there is a major concentration and growth in family dwellings of a seasonal nature, or second homes, in this region, and a proliferation of illegal construction in the parishes of São João das Lampas, São Pedro de Penaferrim, Belas, Agualva-Cacém and Casal de Cambra.

==Economy==

The growth in tertiary activities has played an important part in the pattern of employment in the region, with commercial, retail and support services predominating. This has been to the detriment of industry, although continuing industrial activities include the transport of materials, mineral processing, the manufacture of machinery and equipment, food-processing, beverage and tobacco companies as well as publishing and printing services. There has also been a dramatic growth in the civil construction industry.

EuroAtlantic Airways has its head office in Sintra.

Tourism is also significant, with the parks and monuments operated by the Parques de Sintra accounting for 3.2 million visitors in 2017, for example.

==Transport==

Lisbon&#x27;s commuter railway network (CP Urban Services) provides direct services to Sintra Station. The journey to Lisbon takes 35–45 minutes. There is alternative transport, taxis, car-sharing services and buses, covering a large area of the district.

The Sintra tramway links Sintra with the Atlantic coast at Praia das Maçãs, providing a beautiful scenic ride along the way and covering a distance of some . , the heritage line runs Wednesday to Sunday in summer months.

Tourist bus 434 takes visitors between attractions in Sintra. The bus follows a one-way route and stops at Sintra Station, São Pedro de Sintra, the Castle of the Moors, Pena National Palace, Sintra Old Town and returns to Sintra Station.

<text>Vincent, Count Benedetti (29 April 181728 March 1900) was a French diplomat. He is probably best known as one of the central figures in the instigation of the Franco-Prussian War through his role in the Ems Dispatch.

==Life and career==
Benedetti was born to a family of Greek origin at Bastia, on the island of Corsica. In 1840, he entered the service of the French foreign office and was appointed to a post under the Marquis de la Valette, who was consul-general at Cairo. He spent eight years in Egypt, being appointed consul in 1845. Whilst in Egypt, Benedetti met and eventually married a Greek slave woman who was a survivor of the Massacre of Chios. In 1848, he was made consul at Palermo, and in 1851, he accompanied the marquis, who had been appointed ambassador at Constantinople, as first secretary.

For fifteen months during the progress of the Crimean War, Benedetti acted as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. In the second volume of his essays, he gives some recollections of his experiences in the East, including an account of Mehemet Ali, and a (not very friendly) sketch of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe. In 1855, after refusing the post of minister at Tehran, he was employed in the foreign office at Paris, and acted as secretary to the congress at Paris (1855–1856). During the next few years, he was chiefly occupied with Italian affairs, in which he was much interested, and Cavour said of him that he was an Italian at heart. He was chosen in 1861 to be the first envoy of France to the king of Italy, but he resigned his post the next year on the retirement of Édouard de Thouvenel, who had been his patron, when the anti-Italian party began to gain the ascendancy at Paris. In 1864, he was appointed ambassador at the court of Prussia.

Benedetti remained in Berlin until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and during these years, he played an important part in the diplomatic history of Europe. His position was a difficult one, for Napoleon III did not keep him fully informed as to the course of French policy. In 1866, the Austro-Prussian War broke out, and during the critical weeks which followed the attempt of Napoleon to intervene between Prussia and Austria, he accompanied the Prussian headquarters in the advance on Vienna. During a visit to Vienna, he helped to arrange the preliminaries of the armistice signed at Nikolsburg.

Following the end of the Austro-Prussian War, Benedetti was instructed to present to Bismarck the French demands for &quot;compensation&quot; for France&#x27;s neutrality during the Austro-Prussian War - Prussian agreement for a French annexation of Belgium and Luxembourg. In August, after his return to Berlin, as a result of his discussions with Bismarck, a draft treaty was drawn up, in which Prussia promised France her support in the annexation of Belgium. This treaty was never concluded, but the draft, which was in Benedetti&#x27;s handwriting, was kept by Bismarck and, in 1870, a few days after the outbreak of the war, was published by him in &quot;The Times&quot;.

During 1867, Benedetti was much occupied with the affair of Luxembourg, in which France attempted to purchase Luxembourg from the Netherlands. There was an immediate uproar in Germany from pan-German nationalists, and the pre-eminent German power (Prussia) seemed poised to declare war on France over the issue. The French government however was thwarted by the subsequent Conference of London, which confirmed the independence of Luxembourg, along with a guarantee of Luxembourg&#x27;s independence by all European Great Powers.
In July 1870, when the candidature of the prince of Hohenzollern for the throne of Spain became known, Benedetti was instructed by the duc de Gramont to present to the king of Prussia, who was then at Bad Ems, the French demands, that the king should order the prince to withdraw, and afterwards that the king should promise that the candidature would never be renewed. This last demand Benedetti submitted to the king in informal meetings on the promenade at Ems, and Bismarck&#x27;s publication of the conversations gave the impression that Benedetti had approached the king in an undiplomatic way and that the king had reacted evenly inappropriately. The emotions stirred up by the incident and Bismarck&#x27;s publication paved the way to the Franco-Prussian War which followed. Benedetti was severely attacked in his own country for his conduct as ambassador, and the duc de Gramont attempted to throw upon him the blame for the failures of French diplomacy.

 Benedetti answered the charges brought against him in a book, &quot;Ma Mission en Prusse&quot; (Paris, 1871), which still remains one of the most valuable authorities for the study of Bismarck&#x27;s diplomacy. In this, Benedetti successfully defends himself, and shows that he had kept his government well informed; he had even warned them a year before as to the proposed Hohenzollern candidature. Even if he had been outwitted by Bismarck in the matter of the treaty of 1866, the policy of the treaty was not his, but was that of E. Drouyn de Lhuys. The idea of the annexation of Wallonia, Belgium, to France had been suggested to him first by Bismarck; and the use to which Bismarck put the draft was not one which he could be expected to anticipate, for he had carried on the negotiations in good faith.

After the fall of the Empire, Benedetti retired to Corsica. He lived to see his defence confirmed by later publications, which threw more light on the secret history of the times. He published in 1895 a volume of &quot;Essais diplomatiques&quot;, containing a full account of his mission to Ems, written in 1873; and in 1897 a second series dealing with the Eastern question. He died on 28 March 1900, while on a visit to Paris. He received the title of Count from Napoleon.

<text>Estoril () is a town in the civil parish of Cascais e Estoril of the Portuguese Municipality of Cascais, on the Portuguese Riviera. It is a popular tourist destination, with hotels, beaches, and the Casino Estoril. It has been home to numerous royal families and celebrities, and has hosted a number of high-profile events, such as the Estoril Open and the Lisbon &amp; Estoril Film Festival.

Estoril is one of the most expensive places to live in Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula. It is home to a sizable foreign community and known for its luxury restaurants, hotels, and entertainment. Cascais is consistently ranked for its high quality of living, making it one of the most livable places in Portugal.

==Etymology==
&quot;Estoril&quot; may derive from the Old Portuguese &quot;estorga&quot; (heather) - a common plant in the area – with the final meaning of &quot;place where heather grows or is abundant&quot;, or from the Old Portuguese &quot;astor&quot; (Northern goshawk), meaning a place where such birds live.

==History==
The territory of Estoril has been inhabited for centuries, owing to its climatic conditions and favourable environment. Throughout the civil parish there are scattered remains of these early communities — Phoenicians, Romans and Arabs selected this area for its strategic place in Western Europe. There are remains of Roman villas in the parish that push back the history of the region to the first millennium, when the settlements of the coast were dependent on the fishing ports. From these settlements, Estoril inherited a rich cultural heritage, architecture, toponymy, habits and customs.

In 1147, during the Reconquista, the region was brought under Christian control.

Owing to its strategic location, the region was intimately linked to the Portuguese Age of Discovery and all the dynamic social and cultural upheavals that it originated.

Its solid fortifications are a testament to the innumerable attacks by Spanish, French and English pirates and privateers. The many forts that dot the coastline are symbols of the resistance and battles that secured Portuguese independence and national interests.

At the end of the monarchy, it was in the waters of Estoril that many sought refuge and escape. Aristocrats, nobles and others escaped through the ports along the Estoril coast to flee from the Republican forces.

In the hilltop enclave of Monte Estoril (situated between Estoril and Cascais), is the Verdades-Faria Museum, built in 1917 by Jorge O&#x27;Neil. In 1942, the building was bought by Mantero Belard and dedicated to the support of the arts and artists. Following his death, the building was donated to Cascais Council under the name of Verdades Faria and now houses the regional Museum of Portuguese Music.

During the Second World War, the region was a centre of spies and diplomatic secrecy, situations that provided the region with a cosmopolitan atmosphere and sophistication. Due to the vision of Fausto Cardoso de Figueiredo and his business partner Augusto Carreira de Sousa, it became an international tourist destination both during and after the Second World War.

During that time, several dignitaries and exiles came to Estoril: Miklós Horthy, the regent of Hungary (lived and died in exile after the Second World War); the Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona (father of Juan Carlos I of Spain) and the King resided in the territory, as did Umberto II of Italy and Carol II of Romania. Former King Edward VIII the Duke of Windsor, briefly resided in an Estoril villa as more direct and reliably safe routes to London from France for his escape were cut off by Blitzkrieg during the invasion.

It was also in this location that former Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar had a summer house. It was Salazar who ordered the construction of the E.N.6 motorway, more commonly referred to as the &quot;Avenida Marginal&quot;, in order for him to quickly travel by car between Cascais and Lisbon (until then the accessway was nothing more than a dirt road, where traffic could only circulate at low speed and make frequent stops). The roadway permitted the dictator to travel rapidly, and with fewer stops, it wasn&#x27;t possible for him to be recognized easily in transit.

The 4th World Chess Champion Alexander Alekhine died in Estoril in 1946 under unknown circumstances.

The engineer John Tojeiro was born in Estoril.

==Geography==

The Estoril coast is relatively close to Lisbon, the Portuguese capital; it extends from Carcavelos, from the capital, and stretches as far as the beach of Guincho (sometimes referred colloquially as the &quot;Costa de Estoril-Sintra&quot; or &quot;Costa de Lisboa&quot;). Estoril includes several smaller boroughs and localities along the coastline, namely (from east to west): São Pedro do Estoril, São João do Estoril, Santo António do Estoril (or simply Estoril) and Monte Estoril, as well as other to the interior.

Estoril is popularly recognized for the Casino Estoril, widely regarded as Europe&#x27;s largest casino.

===Climate===
==Culture==
The Museum of Portuguese Music- Casa Verdades de Faria hosts an important collection of musical instruments related to popular music, assembled by Michel Giacometti.

Christine McVie, from the band Fleetwood Mac, wrote a song called &quot;Nights in Estoril&quot; for their album &quot;Time&quot;.

Serbian-Portuguese author Dejan Tiago Stankovic published &quot;Estoril, a war novel&quot; in 2016, about Estoril during World War II.

==Sport==
The major local sports club is the Grupo Desportivo Estoril Praia.

Motorsport events are frequent at the Estoril Circuit, although Formula One is no longer on the circuit&#x27;s calendar. This was due to the circuit not coming up to FIA safety standards, leading to the 1997 event being canceled. Following a review on safety, Estoril was reshaped in 1999, the first two corners being affected the most. Today&#x27;s circuit is in length and is run in a clockwise fashion. The circuit also used to host MotoGP, among other lower formula events.

Estoril Open is a tennis tournament within the ATP World Tour.

==Education==

There are numerous education opportunities in and near Estoril, including a number of private schools for expats. The German community hosts a kindergarten and elementary school campus of the German School of Lisbon. True to the high-end living in the area, there are schools for tennis , art , and intensive academic training from age five through college . There are dozens of schools in the area. Most appear to be private, though six of the public schools can be reviewed at Agrupamento de Escolas de Parede.

==Notable people==
*Fulgencio Batista (1901-1973) Cuban dictator, lived in Estoril briefly before dying.
*King Carol II of Romania lived in Estoril after abdication.
*Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya (1868-1957) lived here after exile from Hungary until his death.
*Eba Viegas (born 1999), Portuguese footballer

<text>The Estoril Casino () is a casino in the Portuguese Riviera, in the municipality of Cascais, Portugal. Today, it is one of the biggest working casinos in Europe.

==History==

The first stone was laid on 16 January 1916 by then-President Dr. Bernardino Machado, a venture of Fausto Figueiredo.

During the Second World War, it was reputed to be a gathering point for spies, dispossessed royals, and wartime adventurers; it became an inspiration for Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond 007 novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

The casino passed into the hands of José Teodoro dos Santos in 1958. During the 1960s, the primitive building was expanded, under the direction of Filipe Nobre de Figueiredo and José Segurado, accompanied by the civil engineer Manuel Agostinho Duarte Gaspar, and was decorated by Daciano da Costa and José Espinho.

Following the death of José Teodoro dos Santos in 1987, the concession was headed by a consortium of family members, that included his widow (Marcelina Teodoro dos Santos), his son (Jorge Teodoro dos Santos) and his daughter (D. Maria Emilia Teodoro dos Santos Telles). The presidency of the administrative council was headed by Santos&#x27; son-in-law Dr. Manuel Joaquim Telles, co-adjunct of Grupo Estoril-Sol&#x27;s administration (also managed Estoril-Sol 5-star hotel). The administration of Estoril-Sol also included his children (Dr. José Telles and Dr. Jorge Telles), Henrique Rosa Santos, his mother (D. Henriqueta Santos) and his sister (D. Ana Maria Santos). After 1987, majority interest was obtained by Stanley Ho, and began to be administered by Mário Assis Ferreira that is still today its President. In 2022, the late Stanley Ho&#x27;s company, Estroil Sol, controlled by daughter Pansy Ho, was re-awarded the gaming license for the Casino Estoril as well as a casino in Lisbon.

Inclusive of multiple casino properties, the management company Estoril Sol reported €80.6 million in net revenue for 2021.

==Architecture==
The modernist architecture is situated in the coastal area of Estoril, in the municipality of Cascais, situated from the southwest of Lisbon.

<text>Eugène Rouher (30 November 18143 February 1884) was a French of the Second Empire.

He was born at Riom (Puy-de-Dôme), where he practised law after taking his degree in Paris in 1835. In 1846 he sought election to the Chamber of Deputies as an official candidate of the Guizot ministry. It was only after the Revolution of 1848, however, that he became deputy for the department of Puy-de-Dôme. Re-elected to the Legislative Chamber in 1849 he succeeded Odilon Barrot as minister of justice, with the additional office of keeper of the seals (20 December 1848 to 26 October 1851 and 3 December 1851 to 22 January 1852).

From the tribune of the Chamber he described the revolution of February as a &quot;catastrophe,&quot; and he supported reactionary legislation, notably the bill (31 May 1850) for the limitation of the suffrage. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 2 December 1851, he was entrusted with the redaction of the new constitution, and on his resignation of office in January became vice-president of the Council of State. After the formal establishment of the Empire, Napoleon III rewarded him with a grant of £40,000 and the estate of Cirey.

In 1855 he became minister of agriculture, commerce and public works, and in 1856 senator. He created France&#x27;s excellent system of railways without making them a state monopoly, and he conducted the complicated negotiations for the treaty of commerce with England which was concluded in January 1860, and subsequently arranged similar treaties with Belgium and Italy. On 23 June 1863 he became minister president of the Council of State, and on the death of Adolphe Billault on 18 October 1863 minister of state and chief spokesman of the emperor. before the &quot;Corps Législatif&quot;.

Although the government had a great majority in the Chamber, the opposition counted the redoubtable names of Adolphe Thiers, Berryer and Jules Favre, and government measures were only passed by frequent resort to the closure. Rouher had to defend Napoleon&#x27;s foreign adventures as well as the free trade treaties and the extravagances of Baron Haussmann for which he was directly responsible. After an attempted defence of the foreign policy which had aided the aggrandizement of Prussia at the expense of Austria, Thiers told him in the Chamber that there were &quot;no more blunders left for him to make.&quot;

He opposed the abortive Liberal concessions of January 1867, announced in a personal letter from Napoleon III to himself, and resigned with the rest of the cabinet, only to resume office after a short interval as minister of finance from 20 January to 13 November 1867. When concessions became inevitable Rouher, the &quot;vice-empereur&quot; resigned to make way after six months&#x27; interval for Emile Ollivier. He still fought for reaction in his new office of President of the French Senate from 20 July, to 4 September 1870. After the fall of the Empire he fled to England, but returned to France a year later to work for the fortunes of the prince imperial. After serious disturbances he was elected member for Ajaccio on 11 February 1872, his election being characterized by the prefect of Corsica as a regular conspiracy in favour of the Empire.

In the Chamber, where he subsequently represented Riom, he formed the group of the &quot;Appel au Peuple&quot;. His first speech in the House was the occasion (21 May 1872) of violent attacks by Audiffret-Pasquier and Léon Gambetta.

In the 1876 legislative elections for the Bastia constituency Rouher won 8,790 votes against 4,367 votes for Patrice de Corsi, and was proclaimed elected on 25 February 1876.

The death of the prince imperial in 1879 put an end to the serious chances of the Bonapartists, although Rouher sought to secure the recognition of Prince Napoleon, son of Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jerome, as heir to the Imperial honours. Rouher lost his reason after a stroke of paralysis in 1883, and died a few months later.

<doc id="184976" wikidata="Q176558" url="?curid=184976" title="Annie Dillard">
<text>Annie Dillard (née Doak; born April 30, 1945) is an American author, best known for her narrative prose in both fiction and nonfiction. She has published works of poetry, essays, prose, and literary criticism, as well as two novels and one memoir. Her 1974 book &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot; won the 1975 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. From 1980, Dillard taught for 21 years in the English department of Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Connecticut.

==Early life==
Dillard was born April 30, 1945, in Pittsburgh to Frank and Pam Doak. She is the eldest of three daughters. 

Early childhood details can be drawn from Annie Dillard&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;An American Childhood&quot; (1987), about growing up in the 1950s Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh in &quot;a house full of comedians.&quot; The book focuses on &quot;waking up&quot; from a self-absorbed childhood and becoming immersed in the present moment of the larger world. She describes her mother as an energetic non-conformist. Her father taught her many useful subjects such as plumbing, economics, and the intricacies of the novel &quot;On the Road&quot;, though by the end of her adolescence she began to realize neither of her parents were infallible.

In her autobiography, Dillard describes reading a wide variety of subjects including geology, natural history, entomology, epidemiology, and poetry, among others. Among the influential books from her youth were &quot;The Natural Way to Draw&quot; and &quot;Field Book of Ponds and Streams&quot; because they allowed her a way to interact with the present moment and a way of escape, respectively. Her days were filled with exploring, piano and dance classes, rock collecting, bug collecting, drawing, and reading books from the public library including natural history and military history such as that of World War II.

As a child, Dillard attended the Shadyside Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh, though her parents did not attend.&quot;&quot; She spent four summers at the First Presbyterian Church (FPC) Camp in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. As an adolescent, she stopped attending church, citing &quot;hypocrisy.&quot; When she told her minister of her decision, she was given four volumes of C. S. Lewis&#x27;s broadcast talks, from which she appreciated that author&#x27;s philosophy on suffering, but elsewhere found the topic inadequately addressed.&quot;&quot;

She attended Pittsburgh Public Schools until fifth grade, and then The Ellis School until college.

==Education==
Dillard attended Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia, where she studied English, theology, and creative writing. Dillard stated, &quot;In college I learned how to learn from other people. As far as I was concerned, writing in college didn&#x27;t consist of what little Annie had to say, but what Wallace Stevens had to say. I didn&#x27;t come to college to think my own thoughts, I came to learn what had been thought.&quot; She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1967 and a Master of Arts degree in 1968. Her Master&#x27;s thesis on Henry David Thoreau showed how Walden Pond functioned as &quot;the central image and focal point for Thoreau&#x27;s narrative movement between heaven and earth.&quot; 

Dillard spent the first few years after graduation oil painting, writing, and keeping a journal. Several of her poems and short stories were published, and during this time she also worked for Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Anti-Poverty Program.

From 1975 to 1978, Dillard was a scholar-in-residence at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. 

Dillard has since received honorary doctorate degrees from Boston College, Connecticut College, and the University of Hartford.

== Career ==

=== Writing ===
Dillard&#x27;s works have been compared to those by Virginia Woolf, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, William Blake, and John Donne, and she cites Henry James, Thomas Hardy, Graham Greene, George Eliot, and Ernest Hemingway among her favorite authors.

==== &quot;Tickets for a Prayer Wheel&quot; (1974) ====

In her first book of poems, &quot;Tickets for a Prayer Wheel&quot; (1974), Dillard first articulated themes that she would later explore in other works of prose.

==== &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot; (1974) ====

Dillard&#x27;s journals served as a source for &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot; (1974), a nonfiction narrative about the natural world near her home in Roanoke, Virginia. Although the book contains named chapters, it is not (as some critics assumed) a collection of essays. Early chapters were published in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Harpers&quot;, and &quot;Sports Illustrated.&quot; The book describes God by studying creation, leading one critic to call her &quot;one of the foremost horror writers of the 20th Century.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Eudora Welty said the work was &quot;admirable writing&quot; that reveals &quot;a sense of wonder so fearless and unbridled... [an] intensity of experience that she seems to live in order to declare,&quot; but &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t know what [Dillard] is talking about at... times.&quot;

The book won the 1975 Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction. Dillard was 28, making her the youngest woman to have won the award.

==== &quot;Holy the Firm&quot; (1977) ====
One day, Dillard decided to begin a project in which she would write about whatever happened on Lummi Island within a three-day time period. When a plane crashed on the second day, Dillard began to contemplate the problem of pain and God&#x27;s allowance of &quot;natural evil to happen.&quot; 

Although &quot;Holy the Firm&quot; (1977) was only 66 pages long, it took her 14 months, writing full-time, to complete the manuscript. In &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; novelist Frederick Buechner called it &quot;a rare and precious book.&quot; Some critics wondered whether Dillard was under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs while writing the book. Dillard replied that she was not.

==== &quot;Teaching a Stone to Talk&quot; (1982) ====
&quot;Teaching a Stone to Talk&quot; (1982) is a book of 14 short nonfiction narrative and travel essays. The essay &quot;Life on the Rocks: The Galapagos&quot; won the New York Women&#x27;s Press Club award, and &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; was chosen for &quot;Best American Essays of the [20th] Century&quot; (2000). As Dillard herself notes, &quot;&#x27;The Weasel is lots of fun; the much-botched church service is (I think) hilarious.&quot; Following the first hardcover edition of the book, the order of essays was changed. Initially &quot;Living Like Weasels&quot; was first, followed by &quot;An Expedition to the Pole.&quot; &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; was found between &quot;On a Hill Far Away&quot; and &quot;Lenses.&quot;

The essays in &quot;Teaching a Stone to Talk&quot;: 
*&quot;Total Eclipse&quot; 
*&quot;An Expedition to the Pole&quot;
*&quot;In the Jungle&quot;
*&quot;Living Like Weasels&quot;
*&quot;The Deer at Providencia&quot;
*&quot;Teaching a Stone to Talk&quot;
*&quot;On a Hill Far Away&quot;
*&quot;Lenses&quot;
*&quot;Life on the Rocks: The Galapagos&quot;
*&quot;A Field of Silence&quot;
*&quot;God in the Doorway&quot;
*&quot;Mirages&quot;
*&quot;Sojourner&quot;
*&quot;Aces and Eights&quot;

==== &quot;Living by Fiction&quot; (1982) ====
In &quot;Living by Fiction&quot; (1982), Dillard produced her &quot;theory about why flattening of character and narrative cannot happen in literature as it did when the visual arts rejected deep space for the picture plane.&quot; She later said that, in the process of writing this book, she talked herself into writing an old-fashioned novel.

==== &quot;Encounters with Chinese Writers&quot; (1984) ====
&quot;Encounters with Chinese Writers&quot; (1984) is a work of journalism. One part takes place in China, where Dillard was a member of a delegation of six American writers and publishers, following the fall of the Gang of Four. In the second half, Dillard hosts a group of Chinese writers, whom she takes to Disneyland along with Allen Ginsberg. Dillard describes it as &quot;hilarious.&quot;

==== &quot;The Writing Life&quot; (1989) ====
&quot;The Writing Life&quot; (1989) is a collection of short essays in which Dillard &quot;discusses with clear eye and wry wit how, where and why she writes.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;a kind of spiritual &quot;Strunk &amp; White&quot;, a small and brilliant guidebook to the landscape of a writer&#x27;s task.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that, &quot;For nonwriters, it is a glimpse into the trials and satisfactions of a life spent with words. For writers, it is a warm, rambling conversation with a stimulating and extraordinarily talented colleague.&quot; &quot;The Detroit News&quot; called it &quot;a spare volume...that has the power and force of a detonating bomb.&quot; According to a biography of Dillard written by her husband Robert D. Richardson, Dillard &quot;repudiates &quot;The Writing Life&quot;, except for the last chapter, the true story of stunt pilot Dave Rahm.&quot;

==== &quot;The Living&quot; (1992) ====

Dillard&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Living&quot; (1992), centers on the first European settlers of the Pacific Northwest coast. While writing the book, she never allowed herself to read works that postdated the year she was writing about, nor did she use anachronistic words.

==== &quot;Mornings Like This&quot; (1995) ====
&quot;Mornings Like This&quot; (1995) is a book dedicated to found poetry. Dillard took and arranged phrases from various old books, creating poems that are often ironic in tone. The poems are not related to the original books&#x27; themes. &quot;A good trick should look hard and be easy,&quot; said Dillard. &quot;These poems were a bad trick. They look easy and are really hard.&quot;

==== &quot;For the Time Being&quot; (1999) ====
&quot;For the Time Being&quot; (1999) is a work of narrative nonfiction. Its topics mirror the various chapters of the book and include &quot;birth, sand, China, clouds, numbers, Israel, encounters, thinker, evil, and now.&quot; In her own words on this book, she writes, &quot;I quit the Catholic Church and Christianity; I stay near Christianity and Hasidism.&quot;

==== &quot;The Maytrees&quot; (2007) ====
&quot;The Maytrees&quot; (2007) is Dillard&#x27;s second novel. The story begins after World War II and tells of a lifelong love between a husband and wife who live in Provincetown, Cape Cod. It was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction in 2008.

==== &quot;The Abundance&quot; (2017) ====
&quot;The Abundance&quot;, a collection of essays curated by the author, was published in 2017.

=== Teaching ===
In 1975, Dillard moved to the Pacific Northwest and taught for four years at Fairhaven College and Western Washington University. In 1980, she began teaching in the English department of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where she remained until she retired Professor Emerita in 2002.

==Awards and honors==
Dillard&#x27;s books have been translated into at least 10 languages. Her 1975 Pulitzer-winning book, &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot;, made Random House&#x27;s survey of the century&#x27;s 100 best nonfiction books. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; survey of the century&#x27;s 100 best Western novels includes &quot;The Living&quot;. The century&#x27;s 100 best spiritual books (ed. Philip Zaleski) also includes &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot;. The 100 best essays (ed. Joyce Carol Oates) includes &quot;Total Eclipse,&quot; from &quot;Teaching a Stone to Talk&quot;. The translators of two of Dillard&#x27;s books—Sabine Porte and Pierre Gault—have won Maurice-Edgar Cointreau Prizes in France for their translations. Gault&#x27;s translation of &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot; as &quot; Pélerinage à Tinker Creek&quot; won in 1999 and Porte&#x27;s translation of &quot;For the Time Being&quot; as &quot; Au Présent&quot; won in 2002.

To celebrate its city&#x27;s centennial in 1984, the Boston Symphony commissioned Sir Michael Tippett to compose a symphony. He based part of its text on &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot;.

In 1997, Dillard was inducted into the Connecticut Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame for Writing and Journalism.

In 2000, Dillard&#x27;s &quot;For the Time Being&quot; received the PEN/Diamonstein-Spielvogel Award for the Art of the Essay.

In 2005, artist Jenny Holzer used &quot;An American Childhood&quot;, along with three other books, in her light-based &#x27;scrolling&#x27; artwork &quot;For Pittsburgh,&quot; installed at the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; named &quot;Maytrees&quot; among the top ten books published in 2007.

On September 10, 2015, Dillard was awarded a National Humanities Medal.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===

In 1965, at age 20, Dillard married her creative writing professor, Richard Dillard. In 1975, they divorced amicably and she moved from Roanoke to Lummi Island near Bellingham, Washington.

In 1976, she married Gary Clevidence, an anthropology professor at Fairhaven College, and they have a child, Cody Rose, born in 1984. Dillard and Clevidence remained married until 1988.

In 1988, Dillard married historical biographer Robert D. Richardson, whom she met after sending him a fan letter about his book &quot;Henry Thoreau: A Life of the Mind.&quot; They were married until Richardson&#x27;s death in 2020.

===Religion===
After college Dillard says she became &quot;spiritually promiscuous.&quot; Her first prose book, &quot;Pilgrim at Tinker Creek&quot;, makes references not only to Christ and the Bible, but also to Islam, and Judaism, Buddhism, and Inuit spirituality. Dillard for a while converted to Roman Catholicism around 1988. This was described in detail in a &quot;New York Times&quot; overview of her work in 1992. 

In 1994, she won the Campion Award, given to a Catholic writer every year by the editors of &quot;America&quot;. In her 1999 book, &quot;For the Time Being&quot;, she describes her abandonment of Christianity, describing the supposed absurdity of some Christian doctrines, while stating she still stays near Christianity, and continuing to valorize Catholic writer Teilhard de Chardin. Her personal website lists her religion as &quot;none.&quot;

===Philanthropy===
Sales of Dillard&#x27;s paintings benefit Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit international health organization founded by Dr. Paul Farmer. Dillard&#x27;s art is available on her website.

<text>Home automation or domotics is building automation for a home. A home automation system will monitor and/or control home attributes such as lighting, climate, entertainment systems, and appliances. It may also include home security such as access control and alarm systems. 

The phrase smart home refers to home automation devices that have internet access. Home automation, a broader category, includes &quot;any&quot; device that can be monitored or controlled via wireless radio signals, not just those having internet access. When connected with the Internet, home sensors and activation devices are an important constituent of the Internet of Things (&quot;IoT&quot;).

A home automation system typically connects controlled devices to a central smart home hub (sometimes called a &quot;gateway&quot;). The user interface for control of the system uses either wall-mounted terminals, tablet or desktop computers, a mobile phone application, or a Web interface that may also be accessible off-site through the Internet.

== History ==
Early home automation began with labor-saving machines. Self-contained electric or gas powered home appliances became viable in the 1900s with the introduction of electric power distribution and led to the introduction of washing machines (1904), water heaters (1889), refrigerators (1913), sewing machines, dishwashers, and clothes dryers.

In 1975, the first general purpose home automation network technology, X10, was developed. It is a communication protocol for electronic devices. It primarily uses electric power transmission wiring for signalling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts of digital data, and remains the most widely available.

By 2012, in the United States, according to ABI Research, 1.5 million home automation systems were installed.
Per research firm Statista more than 45 million smart home devices will be installed in U.S. homes by the end of the year 2018.

The word &quot;domotics&quot; is a contraction of the Latin word for a home (&quot;domus&quot;) and the word &quot;robotics&quot;. The word &quot;smart&quot; in &quot;smart home&quot; refers to the system being aware of the state of its devices, which is done through the information and communication technologies (ICT) protocol and the Internet of Things (IoT).

== Applications and technologies ==
Home automation is prevalent in a variety of different realms, including:
* Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC): it is possible to have remote control of all home energy monitors over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.
* Lighting control system: a &quot;smart&quot; network that incorporates communication between various lighting system inputs and outputs, using one or more central computing devices.
* Occupancy-aware control system: it is possible to sense the occupancy of the home using smart meters and environmental sensors like CO2 sensors, which can be integrated into the building automation system to trigger automatic responses for energy efficiency and building comfort applications.
* Appliance control and integration with the smart grid and a smart meter, taking advantage, for instance, of high solar panel output in the middle of the day to run washing machines.
* Home robots and security: a household security system integrated with a home automation system can provide additional services such as remote surveillance of security cameras over the Internet, or access control and central locking of all perimeter doors and windows.
* Leak detection, smoke and CO detectors
* Laundry-folding machine, self-making bed
* Indoor positioning systems (IPS).
* Home automation for the elderly and disabled.
* Pet and baby care, for example tracking the pets and babies&#x27; movements and controlling pet access rights.
* Air quality control (inside and outside). For example, Air Quality Egg is used by people at home to monitor the air quality and pollution level in the city and create a map of the pollution.
* Smart kitchen, with refrigerator inventory, premade cooking programs, cooking surveillance, etc.
*Voice control devices like Amazon Alexa or Google Nest used to control home appliances or systems.

== Implementations ==
In 2011, Microsoft Research found that home automation could involve a high cost of ownership, inflexibility of interconnected devices, and poor manageability. When designing and creating a home automation system, engineers take into account several factors including scalability, how well the devices can be monitored and controlled, ease of installation and use for the consumer, affordability, speed, security, and ability to diagnose issues. Findings from iControl showed that consumers prioritize ease-of-use over technical innovation, and although consumers recognize that new connected devices have an unparalleled cool factor, they are not quite ready to use them in their own homes yet.

Historically, systems have been sold as complete systems where the consumer relies on one vendor for the entire system including the hardware, the communications protocol, the central hub, and the user interface. However, there are now open hardware and open source software systems which can be used instead of or with proprietary hardware. Many of these systems interface with consumer electronics such as the Arduino or Raspberry Pi, which are easily accessible online and in most electronics stores. In addition, home automation devices are increasingly interfaced with mobile phones through Bluetooth, allowing for increased affordability and customizability for the user.

== Criticism and controversies ==
Home automation suffers from platform fragmentation and lack of technical standards a situation where the variety of home automation devices, in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them, makes the task of developing applications that work consistently between different inconsistent technology ecosystems hard. Customers may hesitate to bet their IoT future on proprietary software or hardware devices that use proprietary protocols that may fade or become difficult to customize and interconnect.

The nature of home automation devices can also be a problem for security, data security and data privacy, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices. One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active devices vulnerable.

Concerns have been raised by tenants renting from landlords who decide to upgrade units with smart home technology. These concerns include weak wireless connections that render the door or appliance unusable or impractical; the security of door passcodes kept by the landlord; and the potential invasion of privacy that comes with connecting smart home technologies to home networks.

Researchers have also conducted user studies to determine what the barriers are for consumers when integrating home automation devices or systems into their daily lifestyle. One of the main takeaways was regarding ease of use, as consumers tend to steer towards &quot;plug and play&quot; solutions over more complicated setups. One study found that there were large gaps in the mental-models generated by users regarding how the devices actually work. Specifically, the findings showed that there was a lot of misunderstanding related to where the data collected by smart devices was stored and how it was used. For example, in a smart light setup, one participant thought that her iPad communicated directly with the light, telling it to either turn-off or on. In reality, the iPad sends a signal to the cloud system that the company uses (in this case, the Hue Bridge) which then signals directly to the device.

Overall, this field is still evolving and the nature of each device is constantly changing. While technologists work to create more secure, streamlined, and standardized security protocols, consumers also need to learn more about how these devices work and what the implications of putting them in their homes can be. The growth of this field is currently limited not only by technology but also by a user&#x27;s ability to trust a device and integrate it successfully into his/her daily life.

== Impact ==
Utilizing home automation could lead to more efficient and intelligent energy-saving techniques. By integrating information and communication technologies (ICT) with renewable energy systems such as solar power or wind power, homes can autonomously make decisions about whether to store energy or expend it for a given appliance, leading to overall positive environmental impacts and lower electricity bills for the consumers using the system. To do this, researchers propose using data from sensors regarding consumer activity within the home to anticipate consumer needs and balance that with energy consumption.

Furthermore, home automation has a large potential regarding family safety and security. According to a 2015 survey done by iControl, the primary drivers of the demand for smart and connected devices are first &quot;personal and family security&quot;, and second &quot;excitement about energy savings&quot;. Home automation includes a variety of smart security systems and surveillance setups. This allows consumers to monitor their homes while away, and to give trusted family members access to that information in case anything bad happens.

While there are many competing vendors, there are increasing efforts towards open source systems. However, there are issues with the current state of home automation including a lack of standardized security measures and deprecation of older devices without backwards compatibility.

Home automation has high potential for sharing data between family members or trusted individuals for personal security purposes and could lead to energy saving measures with a positive environmental impact in the future.

The home automation market was worth US$64 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow to over $163 billion in 2028.

<doc id="184979" wikidata="Q843687" url="?curid=184979" title="Black Friday (1869)">
<text>On September 24, 1869, a gold panic broke out in the United States, triggering a financial crisis. The panic, which became known as Black Friday, was the result of a conspiracy between two investors, Jay Gould, later joined by his partner James Fisk, and Abel Corbin, a small time speculator who had married Virginia (Jennie) Grant, the younger sister of President Ulysses S. Grant. They formed the &quot;Gold Ring&quot; to corner the gold market and force up the price of the metal on the New York Gold Exchange. The scandal took place during the Grant Presidency. The Secretary of the Treasury, George S. Boutwell, had a policy to sell Treasury gold at biweekly intervals for a sinking fund to pay off the national debt. Along with other, non-routine gold sales, this infusion of cash acted to stabilize the dollar. The economy had gone through tremendous upheaval during the Civil War 1861-1865 and was not yet fully restored.

Gould hoped to take advantage of Corbin&#x27;s relationship with his brother-in-law, President Grant, and Gould persuaded Corbin to introduce him to Grant. Gould and Fisk hoped that befriending the President would get them privy information about the government&#x27;s gold policy—and even prevent the sale of gold—and thereby manipulate the market. It did not work, being foiled by the government, yet resulted in a scandal that undermined both the credibility of Grant&#x27;s presidency and the national economy. Gould and Fisk used their personal appearances with Grant to gain credibility on Wall Street in addition to using their insider information.

During the first week of September, Grant&#x27;s Secretary of the Treasury George S. Boutwell received a letter from Grant. It told him that gold sales would be harmful to Western farmers, a notion planted by Gould and Fisk. Boutwell countermanded his own order to sell a great deal of gold, suspending non-routine Treasury gold sales for the rest of the month. At the same time, Gould, now joined by Fisk, continued buying gold through New York City&#x27;s &quot;Gold Room&quot;, raising the price of gold. After learning about the nature of their scheme, Grant first told Corbin to unload his gold holdings before ordering the release of $4 million in government gold on September 24. Grant&#x27;s move immediately drove down the price of gold, crushing the &quot;Gold Ring&quot; corner on the market. A panic on Wall Street ensued and the country went through months of economic turmoil, although a national depression was averted. Gould and Fisk hired the best defense available. Favored by Tweed Ring judges, the conspiratorial partners escaped prosecution. An 1870 government investigation, headed by fellow Republican James A. Garfield, exonerated Grant of any illicit involvement in the conspiracy.

==History==
To finance the Civil War and Reconstruction, the federal government had assumed a large national debt, escalating from $64 million in 1860 to $2.8 billion by the end of the Andrew Johnson administration, when Grant was elected president in 1868. The problem was further compounded when the federal government issued paper money during the Civil War, known as &quot;greenbacks&quot;, which were not redeemable in gold. Mandated as the only payment for federal debts, &quot;both public and private&quot;, these &quot;notes&quot; served to take gold currency out of circulation, in accordance with Gresham&#x27;s law, causing the price of gold to rise sharply. It was generally believed that the U.S. Government would eventually redeem the &quot;greenbacks&quot; with gold.

Grant believed that putting &quot;sound money&quot; back into circulation was the best approach to restoring the nation&#x27;s economy. 
Determined to return the national economy to pre-war monetary standards, one of his first actions as president was to sign the Public Credit Act of 1869, which established a 10-year timetable for returning to the gold standard by repaying U.S. bonds in &quot;gold or its equivalent&quot; and redeeming greenbacks from the economy as soon as possible.

Grant had put the talented George S. Boutwell in charge of the U.S. Treasury. Boutwell&#x27;s primary task was to reduce the national debt. To accomplish this, he ordered his assistant treasurer to begin selling gold from the Treasury and buying up wartime bonds in April 1869. He also initiated reforms in the Treasury Department by improving methods of tax collecting and attacking the problem of counterfeiting. By the end of May, the national debt had been reduced by $12 million. Boutwell&#x27;s treasury policy of reducing the national debt kept the money supply level and the gold price artificially low. The goal of Grant&#x27;s policy was to reduce the amount of greenbacks in circulation that could be redeemed in gold at some future date.

==Cornering the gold market==
In 1869, Jay Gould, a director of the Erie Railroad, sought to corner the gold market with the connivance of Abel Corbin, a financier with a shady past who was President Grant&#x27;s brother-in-law. They worked to persuade the President to stop Secretary of the Treasury Boutwell from releasing weekly gold (but not affecting those routine gold sales for the sinking fund) from U.S. Treasury, with the intention of raising the gold price. James Fisk, another director who had made his fortune as a cotton smuggler during the Civil War, controlled the Erie Railroad in conjunction with Gould. He joined the conspiracy in force later on. The first step in Corbin and Gould&#x27;s plan was to recruit Daniel Butterfield, a former Major General and war hero during the Civil War
 who lacked any experience in finance. Both Corbin and Gould lobbied successfully for Butterfield&#x27;s appointment as the assistant treasurer, through whom Boutwell gave orders to sell Treasury Department gold. Gould bribed Butterfield with a $10,000 check, more than Butterfield&#x27;s annual salary of $8,000. Butterfield agreed to tip the men off when the government intended to sell gold.

Corbin was considered a smooth talker and had made money speculating in real estate. More importantly to Fisk and Gould, he had direct access to Grant. They used Corbin&#x27;s relationship to get close to Grant in social situations, where they argued against government sale of gold, reinforced by Corbin. Gould also attempted to bribe Grant&#x27;s personal secretary Horace Porter by giving him a $500,000 gold account in his name, but Porter, a former military aide to Grant, stated that he declined the offer. Not accustomed to having such offers turned down, Gould went ahead and made the purchase and opened a brokerage account in Porter&#x27;s name regardless. When Porter was informed of Gould&#x27;s unauthorized transaction, he refused the offer in writing. In similar fashion, Corbin approached Grant&#x27;s wife Julia and attempted to entice her into accepting half interest in $250,000 in bonds, but she turned that offer down.

Gould secured controlling interest in the federally audited New York&#x27;s Tenth National Bank, a Wall Street broker&#x27;s bank that was used as a facility to contract business. In addition to meeting at Corbin&#x27;s mansion, Fisk and Gould also talked with Grant on their Erie Canal railroad car and in Fisk&#x27;s box seats at New York&#x27;s Fifth Avenue Theatre. Gould suggested to Grant that increasing gold prices would lower the dollar and allow farmers in the West to sell their crops overseas, but Grant gave no response. Both Grant and Boutwell strongly felt that the nation&#x27;s wartime debt had to be paid to assure the credibility of the United States in the eyes of the European banks. To accomplish this, Boutwell began selling gold from the Treasury&#x27;s reserve of $100 million in gold bars, initially without the President&#x27;s express consent, and using the proceeds to buy back U.S. bonds. Boutwell&#x27;s controversial approach was later endorsed by Grant, giving Boutwell all the latitude he needed. Boutwell later wrote that only outsiders unaware of the finer designs of his dealings thought &quot;the President was taking any part in the operations of the treasury concerning the price of gold&quot;. Grant, meanwhile, was unaware that his appearances in the company of Gould and Fisk sent a message to Wall Street that he supported raising the gold price.

When buying gold and bonds, Boutwell placed all his orders through Daniel Butterfield in New York. To reduce the temptation of illicit dealing, Boutwell, at Butterfield&#x27;s recommendation, publicly announced his orders by telegraphing the news to the Associated Press. Over the next few months Treasury gold began to flood the market while Boutwell began buying back wartime bonds. By September 1, Boutwell had reduced the national debt by $50 million. He continued this practice at an accelerated rate while Grant, having closely followed Boutwell&#x27;s dealings, began to express reservations and sent him a letter from Washington, Pennsylvania, criticizing that driving the price of gold down would hurt farmers. Many brokerage firms collapsed while trade volume and agriculture prices plummeted, causing a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Boutwell saw little merit in either Grant&#x27;s or Gould&#x27;s arguments, feeling that the government had no place in manipulating the market regardless of who benefited. However, not wanting to go against the President, Boutwell ordered Butterfield to halt semi-weekly September government gold sales. Believing he now had a &quot;green light&quot; from Grant, Gould began buying gold through brokers at an accelerated rate, increasing his gold stake from $10 to $18 million in specie.

==Breaking the &quot;Gold Ring&quot;==

Starting on September 1, 1869, Gould and Fisk put their plot into motion by purchasing $1.5million in gold in the names of Corbin and Butterfield. The conspirators would make $15,000 ($ in ) for every dollar rise in the price of gold (which was quoted in increments of $100 face value of gold coin, each containing 4.8375 troy ounces). By September 6, the gold quote had risen from $132.50 to $137. By September 7, Gould was faced with a startling reversal when members of his group were directed to sell off the $6million they had achieved during the previous buying frenzy of April 1869. Prices of gold fell sharply from $137 to $134 in one day. Gould lost more than $100,000 in two days.

Abandoned by his associates, Gould looked to Fisk for assistance, but he was away on railroad business. Fisk returned to New York on September 8 and found Gould worried and depressed. Fisk reminded Gould that he still had &quot;enough gold to sink a ship&quot; while the two looked to others and devised other schemes to come out on top, but they knew by this time that if they began buying again, the Treasury would counter their efforts and begin selling at an accelerated rate once again.

Gould and Fisk had a list of every broker and speculator who had borrowed gold from the gold exchange, some 250 in all, including Jay Cooke, the biggest financier on Wall Street and a prominent voice urging Grant to step in and break the &quot;Gold Ring&quot;. Fisk proposed that the list be published in the newspapers the next day with the demand that the &quot;bulls and bears&quot; settle on their debts by three o&#x27;clock, at a fixed rate of $160. If they refused, Fisk was ready to squeeze them at an even higher rate, a scheme that bordered on blackmail. Fisk&#x27;s associates scoffed at the scheme and criticized Fisk of being true to form for suggesting such an unconventional idea. After being warned that the idea violated New York State criminal conspiracy law, Gould, Fisk and their associates chose another approach: On Friday, they drove the price of gold to an even higher price by buying large amounts of gold at the current high price and selling even higher, regardless of the political and economic effects. Fisk, however, saw the flaw to this alternative approach, fearing that pushing the price of gold up too quickly would provoke the President to step in and break the gold corner.

On September 12, Grant warned Boutwell that a &quot;desperate struggle&quot; was taking place between the &quot;bulls and bears&quot; of the gold market and that Boutwell should continue the current policy, which was to suspend the sales of gold. Corbin told Gould he was concerned that Grant would start selling gold from the Treasury, so Gould told Corbin to write a letter to Grant encouraging him not to sell. Corbin wrote Grant the letter, now lost, encouraging Grant not to sell gold. Fisk had the letter delivered by William Chapin of the Erie Railroad, to Washington, Pennsylvania, where Grant was vacationing with his wife&#x27;s cousin. Interrupting Grant&#x27;s croquet game, Chapin gave him Corbin&#x27;s letter, whereupon Grant read the letter and told Chapin that it was satisfactory, but said, &quot;No, nothing&quot; when Chapin asked for a reply. When Chapin had left, Porter told Grant about Gould setting up a $500,000 gold account in Porter&#x27;s name. Upon hearing this, Grant finally realized what Gould and Fisk were up to. Through a letter his wife was writing to his sister, Grant urged Corbin to have nothing to do with Gould and Fisk and get out of the speculation, and Grant promptly arranged a meeting with Boutwell. On September 20, 1869, Gould and Fisk started hoarding gold, driving the price higher. Gold closed at $141 on September 22, at which time Fisk and Gould owned between $50 and $60million in gold between the two of them, about three times the public supply available in New York. The increase in gold prices on this day alone had netted a profit of $1.75million for the two conspirators. On Thursday, September 23, Gould visited Corbin&#x27;s house and was informed of Julia&#x27;s letter, which had arrived that day. After reading it and discovering that Grant was annoyed with Corbin&#x27;s speculations, Gould knew that Grant was likely to sell government gold on Friday. Subsequently, Corbin asked Gould if he would buy Corbin&#x27;s account so he could tell Grant that he no longer owned any gold, but Gould refused to bail Corbin out, fearing it would trigger a collapse in the market. Instead, he offered Corbin $100,000 interest and exclaimed, &quot;Mr. Corbin, I am undone if that letter gets out&quot;. Gould chose not to inform Fisk of this recent development. When Grant returned to Washington D.C., he found $60,000 worth of gifts from the &quot;Gold Ring&quot; sent to the White House. Sensing bribery, Grant immediately ordered the paintings and statues boxed up and returned.

On September 23, Grant and Boutwell met and the two decided to break the &quot;Gold Ring&quot; by selling gold from the treasury if the gold price continued to rise. On September 24, Gould began quietly selling his gold while &quot;Gold Room&quot; agents put up a public front and continued buying at a lesser rate with Fisk leading the spurious buying activity. When gold had surpassed $155 on Friday, September 24, Grant ordered Boutwell to release $4million in gold and buy $4million worth of bonds. Within minutes, the price of gold dropped from $160 to $138 and Gould&#x27;s and Fisk&#x27;s gold corner was broken. Some speculators were ruined, while gamblers who had bet that the gold price would go down made money. Corbin lost money on the loan he had taken to buy gold.
==Aftermath and investigation==

The Black Friday September 24 gold crash caused the United States financial devastation for months. On Saturday, September 25, Gould, Fisk and Corbin met at Gould&#x27;s office at the Opera House, each claiming to be the victim and blaming the other for the disaster. Obligated to make good on all debts, the Gold Exchange Bank no longer had enough reserves to cover the mounting debts, while the situation there deteriorated by the hour. The Tenth National Bank, which normally closed at 3:00 pm on that day, had depositors and speculators crowding the sidewalk at its front door. The police set up patrols inside and outside the bank.

Stock prices dropped by 20 percent from September 24 to October 1, while trade was minimal. Between January 1870 and September 1870, only 4 million shares of stock were exchanged. Dozens of brokerage firms went bankrupt, those who bought paper gold from Fisk&#x27;s gold room going unpaid. Farmers, who constituted 50 percent of the country&#x27;s workforce, suffered the worst: wheat prices on the Chicago trade fell from $1.40 to $0.77 a bushel, corn dropped from $0.95 to $0.68, and other commodities such as rye, oats, and barley had similar losses. The New York Tribune reported that goods ready for export could not be shipped. Grant&#x27;s and Boutwell&#x27;s actions to break the &quot;Gold Ring&quot;, however, kept the Wall Street panic from growing into a national depression. Butterfield was allowed to resign from the U.S. Treasury without an investigation in October, 1869.

The subsequent Congressional investigation was chaired by Republican James A. Garfield. Grant&#x27;s decision to counter the escalating price of gold did not completely dispel rumors that he and his administration had profited from the affair. It has been alleged on the one hand that the investigation had been limited because Virginia Corbin and First Lady Julia Grant were not called to testify at President Grant&#x27;s behest. Julia Grant may even have received $25,000 in profits from the speculation. The committee&#x27;s Republican majority rejected the proffered testimony from a D.C. businessman who reported seeing the $25,000 entry in an Adams Express Company ledger. When forced to confront the entry in the ledger, however, even the Adams Express executive who brought the ledger in admitted that his first impression was that the figures in the entry for Mrs. U. S. Grant were $25,000. The committee&#x27;s Republicans put forth the excuse this was really a $250.00 entry and denied &quot;the groundless and wicked charge, that Mrs. Grant was interested in this speculation.&quot; Garfield&#x27;s biographer, Alan Peskin maintains that the investigation was quite thorough. The investigation cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould for his manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connections to Grant. Butterfield was implicated for serving as a double agent giving information to Gould. In his Congressional testimony, Gould said Grant &quot;was a very pure, high-minded man; that if he was satisfied what was the best thing to do, that was what he would do.&quot;

Dodging any financial harm, Fisk and Gould escaped conviction, spending money to buy the best legal defense, including talented attorney David Dudley Field, while Democratic Tweed Ring judges such as Albert Cardozo shielded them in court. Gould remained a force on Wall Street, and when he died in December 1892, his estate was worth $70 million. Fisk remained wealthy, but was caught in a scandalous love triangle and shot to death on January 6, 1872. Boutwell served the remainder of Grant&#x27;s first term, and resigned in 1873 to run for United States senator from Massachusetts, serving until 1877 before retiring to private life. In 1871, the Tweed Ring run by &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed was broken by New York reformers including Edwards Pierrepont, Grant&#x27;s future Attorney General, and prominent member of the Committee of Seventy. 

Henry Adams believed that President Ulysses S. Grant was much too tolerant of his corrupt associates. In 1870, Adams wrote an article, &quot;The New York Gold Conspiracy&quot;, that detailed Gould and Fisk&#x27;s scheme to corner the gold market, and hinted that Grant had participated in or at least known of the scheme.

<doc id="184980" wikidata="Q292642" url="?curid=184980" title="Lérins Islands">
<text>The Lérins Islands (in , ) are a group of four Mediterranean islands off the French Riviera, in Cannes. The two largest islands in this group are the Île Sainte-Marguerite and the Île Saint-Honorat. The smaller Îlot Saint-Ferréol and Îlot de la Tradelière are uninhabited. 
Administratively, the islands belong to the &quot;commune&quot; of Cannes.

The islands are first known to have been inhabited during Roman times.

The Île de Saint-Honorat bears the name of the founder of the monastery of Lérins, Saint Honoratus. It was founded around the year 410. According to tradition, Saint Patrick, patron of Ireland, studied there in the fifth century. Around 500, the community was led by Porcarius I. Around 732, the Abbot Porcarius II was killed during a Saracen raid. 

In 1047 the islands were raided by pirates from Andalusia. Thereafter, a fortified monastery was built between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries. The monastic community today lives in a monastery built during the nineteenth century.

The Île Sainte-Marguerite held a fortress where the Man in the Iron Mask was held captive for a time.

In 1707 the Lérins were occupied by the English navy, under the command of Sir Cloudesley Shovell. This was done in order to block the military port of Toulon to help the army of Victor Amadeus II Duke of Savoy and his cousin Eugene besiege that city.

Under the French Revolution, the Île Sainte-Marguerite and the Île Saint-Honorat were renamed the Île Marat and the Île Lepeletier, after secular martyrs.

== Île Sainte-Marguerite ==
Île Sainte-Marguerite (Saint Margaret Island) is about a 15-minute boat ride away from Cannes harbour. The cell of the mysterious &#x27;Man with the Iron Mask&#x27; can be visited in the Fort of Sainte-Marguerite, now renamed the Musée de la Mer (Museum of the Sea). This museum also houses archaeological discoveries from shipwrecks off the coast of the island, including Roman and Saracen ceramics. There is a regular boat service from the mainland.

== Île Saint-Honorat ==
Île Saint-Honorat (Saint Honorat Island), the smaller, southern island, is only inhabited by Cistercian monks. Monks have inhabited the island more or less continuously since AD 410 and, at the height of their secular power, owned Cannes, Mougins, and Vallauris, plus Seborga, Italy. Medieval vestiges remain in the stark church, which is open to the public, and in the ruins of the 11th-century monastery on the sea&#x27;s edge. The monks divide their time between prayer and producing red and white wine, honey, lavender oil and Lérina, a herbal liqueur. Although closed to the general public, the monastery welcomes guests for week-long retreats. The monks also run the only boat trips to the island, with departures from Cannes&#x27; jetty Albert-Edouard.

<doc id="184983" wikidata="Q6082221" url="?curid=184983" title="Islamic Association of Palestine">
<text>Islamic Association of Palestine (IAP, also known as Islamic Association for Palestine) was an organization convicted of providing material support for terrorism in the United States for Hamas. The organization was established in 1981 and has been defunct since 2004. It described itself as &quot;a not-for-profit, public-awareness, educational, political, social, and civic, national grassroots organization dedicated to advancing a just, comprehensive, and eternal solution to the cause of Palestine and suffrages of the Palestinians.&quot; For a time it also used the name American Muslim Society (AMS) and operated as the American Middle Eastern League for Palestine (AMEL).

The Islamic Association of Palestine had strong ties to the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and to several organizations established in the U.S. that were alleged to serve as fronts for Hamas.
Founders included Mousa Abu Marzook, funder and 1989 member of IAP Board of Directors.

==Establishment and goals==
Matthew Levitt, a fellow at pro-Israeli think tank Washington Institute, alleged that Hamas invested considerable resources to give &quot;the Palestinian cause an Islamic flavor.&quot; During the Holy Land Foundation trial, Levitt acted as a key witness to help convict the organization of providing material support for terrorism.

The Islamic Association of Palestine was intimately tied to Hamas, and especially to its senior leadership. Levitt observed that the organization &quot;was originally formed in 1981 by Dr. Aly Mishal at the personal direction of Khaled Mishal (who was then a senior Muslim Brotherhood activist and would later become secretary general of Hamas.&quot; When the Muslim Brotherhood leader in Gaza formally established Hamas in 1987, &quot;the IAP became the group&#x27;s mouthpiece in North America.&quot;

==Affiliation with Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood==
In a May 1991, a memo by an alleged Muslim Brotherhood member argued that IAP and numerous other organizations should unite around the goal of turning America into a Muslim country and promoting the Western civilization. According to The Bridge Initiative at Georgetown University, the memo&#x27;s &quot;language is wishful, and does not reflect the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s agenda as outlined in documents obtained by the FBI.&quot;

Several among IAP officers and founding members were Hamas senior leaders who participated to the 1993 Philadelphia meeting attended by Hamas officers. Some former Islamic Association of Palestine staffers and members were founding members of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). This is the case of Nihad Awad, CAIR&#x27;s executive director who was affiliated to the Islamic Association of Palestine, and who was also a &quot;self-identified supporter of the Hamas movement.&quot; In a March 1994 speech at Barry University, future CAIR Executive Director Awad said in response to an audience question about the various humanitarian efforts in the Palestinian Occupied Territories, &quot;I am in support of the Hamas movement more than the PLO... there are some [Hamas] radicals, we are not interested in those people.&quot; The statement was made before Hamas carried out its first suicide bombing and was designated a terrorist organization by the United States government.

IAP founders included Mousa Abu Marzook, funder and 1989 member of IAP Board of Directors. Abu Marzook served as the chairman of the advisory committee and allegedly donated startup funds to IAP, while providing seed money to the Holy Land Foundation &quot;and operational funds for Mohammed Salah [a self-confessed Hamas member and military commander based in Chicago] to deliver to Hamas operatives in the West Bank.&quot; Allegedly, seven checks, for a total amount of $125,000, were deposited into IAP bank account between 1990 and 1991.

Since the establishment of Hamas, IAP served as Hamas&#x27;s public voice in the United States. The Islamic Association of Palestine published a magazine, &quot;Tareeq Filistine&quot; &quot;(Road to Palestine)&quot;, &quot;Ila Filastin&quot; &quot;(To Palestine)&quot; and the newspapers &quot;Al-Zaytuna&quot; &quot;(The Olive)&quot; and &quot;Muslim World Monitor&quot;. In general, most of its publications consisted of flyers and communiqués encouraging jihad and endorsing Hamas&#x27;s mission. Oliver Revell, former chief of the FBI&#x27;s counter-terrorism department, called IAP &quot;a front organization for Hamas that engages in propaganda for Islamic militants.&quot;

Matthew Levitt reported that IAP published the Hamas charter and distributed Hamas publication in the U.S. Filisteen al-Muslima, &quot;which pays glowing tributes to Hamas suicide bombers, justifies their attacks, and suggests they be models for future suicide bombers.&quot;

IAP also held conventions and workshop to rally support for Hamas. Allegedly, the organization often declared its support for Hamas&#x27; role in the Palestinian Intifada against Israel. In his 2006 book titled &quot;Hamas: Politics, Charity, and Terrorism in the Service of Jihad&quot; Matthew Levitt extensively referenced a December 1989 communiqué published by IAP that serves as a clear example of IAP&#x27;s efforts to endorse Hamas&#x27; mission. The 1989 communiqué reads: &quot;the only way to liberate Palestine, all of Palestine, is the path of Jihad,&quot; and &quot;Hamas is the conscience of the Palestinian Mujahid people.&quot;

==Hamas&#x27;s fundraiser==
IAP publicly called for donations to be directed to the Holy Land Foundation and assisted the foundation in its efforts to fundraise on behalf of Hamas. For instance, the December 1989 communiqué quoted in Matthew Levitt&#x27;s book invited readers to &quot;perform jihad for the sake of God with your money and donate as much as you can to support the Intifada in Palestine,&quot; and directs the funds to the Holy Land Foundation. Generally, solicitations for the Holy Land Foundation were included in almost all of IAP publications.

Furthermore, Levitt recorded that the Islamic Association of Palestine &quot;negotiated fundraising contracts by which the HLFRD [Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development] paid the IAP $40,000 for the IAP fundraising services.&quot;

IAP fundraising efforts on behalf of Hamas were confirmed by Hamas officers. In February 1996 a Hamas activist affiliated with IAP told an FBI source that IAP devolved $3 million per year to the Palestinian cause, funds that were sent to the Holy Land Foundation in Palestine and ultimately received by Hamas.

==Legal issues==
In December 2004, a federal judge in Chicago ruled that the IAP (along with the Holy Land Foundation) was liable for a $156 million lawsuit for aiding and abetting the terror group Hamas in the death of 17-year-old David Boim, an American citizen. In December 2007 the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit overturned the judge&#x27;s ruling, holding that plaintiffs failed to prove that financial contributions to Hamas played a direct role in Boim&#x27;s slaying. In 2008, the Seventh Circuit reheard the case en banc, and ruled in favor of the Boims.

Former Islamic Association of Palestine staffers and members were founding members of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).

<doc id="184984" wikidata="Q204364" url="?curid=184984" title="Fly by Night (album)">
<text>Fly by Night is the second studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released on February 14, 1975, by Mercury Records. It was the first Rush album to showcase elements of progressive rock for which the band has become known. It was also the first to feature lyricist and drummer Neil Peart, who replaced original drummer John Rutsey the previous summer just prior to the band&#x27;s first North American tour. Peart took over as Rush&#x27;s primary lyricist, and the abundance of fantastical and philosophical themes in his compositions contrasted greatly with the simpler hard rock of the band&#x27;s debut album.

==Background and recording==
In March 1974, the second Rush line-up, consisting of guitarist Alex Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and singer and bassist Geddy Lee, released their self-titled debut album. In the following four months, however, Rutsey fell ill following complications with diabetes and had to sit out while the group continued with a replacement, Jerry Fielding. Rutsey rejoined the group for a month of club dates before Lifeson and Lee decided it was best for Rutsey to leave due to the difficulty in managing his health on tour and musical differences between them. Lee recalled: &quot;We were guilt-ridden at first, but we realised that it&#x27;s just the way it had to be. He wasn&#x27;t happy and we weren&#x27;t happy&quot;.

Rush auditioned five drummers, the fourth of which was Neil Peart of a local band named J.R. Flood. The three played along to &quot;Anthem&quot;, a song mostly written while Rutsey was in the group that Rush later recorded for &quot;Fly by Night&quot;. Lifeson and Lee were so impressed with Peart&#x27;s style they felt embarrassed for the fifth drummer who had prepared by writing charts to their songs to follow. Peart joined on July 29, 1974, Lee&#x27;s 21st birthday, two weeks before the band&#x27;s first U.S. tour kicked off on August 14 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, opening for Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band. By the end of the year the group had written new material for a follow-up album.

&quot;Fly by Night&quot; was recorded during the last week of December 1974 and mixed in early January 1975 at Toronto Sound Studios during a gap in touring. Lifeson said it took around five days to record and once the mixing had finished, the group packed their cases and travelled to Winnipeg, starting their &quot;Fly By Night&quot; tour on January 15. It was the band&#x27;s first album co-produced by Terry Brown who would maintain this role through to &quot;Signals&quot; (1982). Lifeson was pleased with the songs on the album and felt like it was a second beginning for the group. Lee recalled the difficulty that their label&#x27;s management had in understanding the material on the album, particularly &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; as they had wanted material in the style of their debut.

==Songs==
The band wanted each song on &quot;Fly by Night&quot; to show a different side to their writing and playing, which resulted in an album of varied styles. As Peart was a keen reader, he became the group&#x27;s primary lyricist, which suited Lifeson and Lee because they preferred to write music. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article reasoned this shift in roles to the &quot;massive&quot; difference in the lyrical styles between their first album and &quot;Fly by Night&quot; which contains more literary themes and references. The songs &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; and &quot;Rivendell&quot; are examples of the inclusion of fantasy themes into Rush&#x27;s music. The original hand-penned lyrics for &quot;Anthem&quot; and &quot;Fly by Night&quot; include different or additional lyrics not sung in the final recording, including a prologue for the latter. The tracks &quot;Best I Can&quot; and &quot;In the End&quot; were written before Peart joined the band, and were performed regularly during Rush&#x27;s first North American tour.

===Side one===
&quot;Anthem&quot; originated by Lifeson and Lee while Rutsey was still in the band and features a heavier sound with more complex arrangements than previous Rush tracks. Peart named the track and its lyrics after the same-titled dystopian novella by Russian-American writer and philosopher Ayn Rand, who would become a greater inspiration to lyrics on their later album &quot;2112&quot; (1976).

The lyrics to &quot;Beneath, Between and Behind&quot; were the first that Peart wrote for Rush. Lee and Lifeson wrote the music after he had finished, the reverse of the process they used for most of the rest of the album.

The eight-minute &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; is arranged in eight distinct sections and marked a key point in the development of the group&#x27;s songwriting. The first part, &quot;At the Tobes of Hades&quot;, remained a mystery to the group years later in regard to its meaning, which is what Peart liked about the track in particular: &quot;But it&#x27;s something that my friend&#x27;s father used to say: &#x27;It&#x27;s hotter than the Tobes of Hades! It is a good versus evil fantasy song that originated from two dogs owned by Rush&#x27;s manager Ray Danniels which their lighting man Howard Ungerleider named Biter and Snow Dog. Lee later said: &quot;We must have been high one day, imagining a song about these two dogs. And then Neil went ahead and wrote it&quot; which had the two characters fight with Snow Dog emerging victorious. He later deemed the track &quot;a joke that got out of control&quot;. On the original vinyl release, the chimes at the end continue into a locked groove, and thus plays indefinitely on manual record players. The song &quot;The Necromancer&quot; from their following album &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; (1975) was described by Peart as the &quot;mythological sequel&quot; to &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog.&quot;

===Side two===
&quot;Fly by Night&quot; is based on Peart&#x27;s experience of moving from Canada to London as a young musician before joining Rush.

&quot;Making Memories&quot; came about after the band had taken a wrong turn on a drive. Lifeson proceeded to write a tune on his acoustic guitar, and had a fully arranged piece by the time the band had entered the studio to record.

&quot;Rivendell&quot; is a slower ballad, named after the fictional Elven settlement in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; legendarium by J. R. R. Tolkien.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Fly by Night&quot; was released in February 1975 and reached No. 9 in Canada and No. 113 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The title track was released as a single in April 1975, reaching No. 45 in Canada. By October 1975, the album had sold 110,000 copies. The original vinyl pressings contained an inner sleeve of photographs and handwritten lyrics by Peart.

Rush supported the album with a U.S. and Canadian tour that covered more than 70 cities from January 15 to June 29, 1975, opening for Kiss and Aerosmith. They performed their first major headline shows across Canada, including a sold-out gig at Massey Hall in Toronto for 4,000 people.

In a review for &quot;Statesville Record &amp; Landmark&quot;, Pam Simon thought the album &quot;is a strange schizophrenic album, almost evenly divided between second-rate acoustic music and the dated concept of the power-trio format&quot;. She was critical of their &quot;heavy-metal material [which] tends toward highly pretentious compositions with epic overtones.&quot; Simon picked out &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; as such an example which she called &quot;especially horrendous&quot;. Though Simon praised Lifeson&#x27;s &quot;more than competent&quot; guitar work and Peart&#x27;s drumming, she criticised Lee&#x27;s &quot;mediocre&quot; voice for sounding too similar to Robert Plant. Michael Dolgy in &quot;RPM Weekly&quot; wrote the album is &quot;a loud but sensitive excursion into ball-blaster rock/roll&quot;. Greg Prato of AllMusic said that the album was less straightforward than their debut album, and while it was not one of their best albums, it was one of their most important because it heralded the band&#x27;s new direction.

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; included the album on their list of the &quot;Top 100 &#x27;70s Rock Albums&quot;, writing &quot;Neil Peart wasn&#x27;t just the new drummer; he was the spark that pushed them to greatness.&quot;

==Reissues==
A remaster was issued in 1997. It was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette as part of the three-volume &quot;Sector&quot; box sets, which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. In addition to the standard audio CD, the album was also included on an audio DVD in the &quot;Sector 1&quot; set, remixed into 5.1 surround sound.

The complete album, along with the self-titled debut and &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;, was included as part of the 1978 Anthem release &quot;Archives&quot;.

&quot;Fly By Night&quot; was remastered for vinyl in 2015 by Sean Magee at Abbey Road Studios as a part of the official &quot;12 Months of Rush&quot; promotion. The high definition master prepared for this release was also made available for purchase in 24-bit/96 kHz and 24-bit/192 kHz formats, at several high-resolution audio online music stores. These masters have significantly less dynamic range compression than the 1997 remasters and the &quot;Sector&quot; remasters by Andy VanDette.

<doc id="184987" wikidata="Q1204213" url="?curid=184987" title="Happy Together (1997 film)">
<text>Happy Together () is a 1997 Hong Kong romantic drama film written and directed by Wong Kar-wai starring Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, depicting a couple&#x27;s turbulent romance. The English title is inspired by the Turtles&#x27; 1967 song of the same name, which is covered by Danny Chung on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The Chinese title (previously used for Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot;) is an idiomatic expression suggesting &quot;the exposure of something intimate&quot;.

The film was regarded as one of the best LGBT films in the New Queer Cinema movement and received critical acclaim and screened at several film festivals such as the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival; it was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or and won Best Director at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2022, &quot;Happy Together&quot; was ranked the 225th greatest film of all time in the &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll. In 2016, the film was ranked the 3rd greatest LGBT film of all time in the British Film Institute poll. In 2018, it was ranked the 71st greatest foreign-language film of all time in the BBC poll.

== Plot ==
Ho Po-Wing and Lai Yiu-Fai are a gay couple from Hong Kong with a tumultuous relationship marked by frequent separations and reconciliations. They visit Argentina together but break up after they become lost while traveling to visit the Iguazu Falls. Without the money to fly home, Fai begins to work as a doorman at a tango bar in Buenos Aires, while Po-Wing lives promiscuously, often seen by Fai with different men. After Fai accuses Po-Wing of spending all of his money and stranding him in Argentina, Po-Wing steals from one of his acquaintances and is severely beaten. Fai allows Po-Wing to live with him in his small rented room and cares for his injuries. They attempt to reconcile their relationship, though it is marred by mutual suspicion and jealousy.

Fai loses his job at the tango bar after beating the man who injured Po-Wing. He begins working at a Chinese restaurant where he befriends Chang, a Taiwanese co-worker. Later, Po-Wing and Fai have a final argument where Fai refuses to return Po-Wing&#x27;s passport. Po-Wing moves out of the apartment when he fully recovers. Sometime thereafter, Chang leaves Buenos Aires to continue his travels. Having finally earned enough money to fly home, Fai decides to visit the Iguazu Falls alone before he leaves. Meanwhile, Po-Wing returns to the empty apartment, heartbroken, realizing that Fai is gone for good.

Fai returns to Hong Kong but has a stopover in Taipei. Coincidentally, he ends up eating at a food stall in a night market run by Chang&#x27;s family. He steals a photo of Chang from the booth, saying that even though he does not know if he will ever see Chang again, he knows where to find him.

== Cast ==

* Leslie Cheung as Ho Po-Wing
* Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Lai Yiu-Fai
* Chen Chang as Chang

== Release ==

===Box office===
During its Hong Kong theatrical release, &quot;Happy Together&quot; made HK$8,600,141 at the box office.

&quot;Happy Together&quot; also had a limited theatrical run in North America through Kino International, where it grossed US$320,319.

=== Censorship ===
The producers of the film considered censoring the film, specifically the opening sex scene for certain audiences. Posters for the movie featuring the two leads fully clothed with their legs intertwined was banned from public places in Hong Kong and removed all together before the movie&#x27;s release.

===Home media===
Kino International released the film on DVD and Blu-ray on June 8, 2010. This release has gone out of print.

The film was picked up by the Criterion Collection and released on March 23, 2021 on Blu-ray in a collection of seven Wong Kar-wai films.

===Critical reception===
The film was generally well received in Hong Kong and has since been heavily analyzed by many Chinese and Hong Kongese scholars and film critics such as Rey Chow (周蕾) and 陳劍梅.

A Hong Kong film review site called it an &quot;elliptical, quicksilver experiment&quot; that is &quot;pure Wong Kar-Wai, which is equal parts longing, regret, and pathetic beauty&quot; and applauding it for its cinematography.

Due to the international recognition that the film received, it was reviewed in several major U.S. publications. Edward Guthmann, of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, gave the film an ecstatic review, lavishing praise on Wong for his innovative cinematography and directorial approach; whilst naming Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs amongst those who would have been impressed by his film. Stephen Holden, of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, said it was a more coherent, heartfelt movie than Wong&#x27;s previous films, without losing the stylism and brashness of his earlier efforts.

Derek Elley for &quot;Variety&quot; gave an overall positive review despite its lack of plot, calling it Wong&#x27;s &quot;most linear and mature work for some time&quot;. Elley praised the mise-en-scène, music, and William Chang&#x27;s production design. He emphasized that Christopher Doyle was the &quot;real star&quot; of the film for his grainy and high contrast cinematography. Both Elley and Andrew Thayne for Asian Movie Pulse stated that both Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-Wai excelled as the main characters in the film.

However, Jonathan Rosenbaum gave the film a mixed review in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. Rosenbaum, in a summary of the film, criticised it for having a vague plotline and chastised Wong&#x27;s &quot;lurching around&quot;. In &quot;Box Office Magazine&quot;, Wade Major gave the film one of its most negative reviews, saying that it offered &quot;little in the way of stylistic or narrative progress, although it should please his core fans.&quot; He deprecated Wong&#x27;s cinematography, labelling it &quot;random experimentation&quot; and went on to say this was &quot;unbearably tedious&quot; due to the lack of narrative.

As per the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 84% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 43 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Happy Together&quot;&#x27;s strong sense of style complements its slice of life love story, even if the narrative slogs&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, with 71% positive reviews based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==

In 1997, Wong Kar-wai was already well known in the art house Chinese cinema world because of the success of his previous films: &quot;Days of Being Wild&quot;, &quot;Chungking Express&quot;, and &quot;Ashes of Time.&quot; However, by winning the Cannes festival award for Best Director for &quot;Happy Together&quot;, his first major award, Wong was given a spotlight on the international stage.

== Music ==
In this film, Wong Kar-wai moved away from his previous centralization of American and British music, favouring South American music instead. This transnationalism &quot;decentralizes America&quot; and forms new connections between cultures that are not conventionally linked (Hong Kong and Argentina). The first song of the film, Caetano Veloso&#x27;s cover of &quot;Cucurrucucú paloma&quot;, a sad ballad about a man waiting for his lover to return, plays when the couple breaks up for the first time in the film. Here, the Iguazu Falls are seen for the first time and it is also the first shot of the film that is in colour. The song extends Fai&#x27;s thoughts, where he is imagining the waterfall, which he associated with Po-Wing. His sadness and lovesickness thereby become apparent in this South American setting.

=== Musical motifs ===
The Frank Zappa song &quot;Chunga&#x27;s Revenge&quot; is played throughout the movie &quot;emphasizing [Fai&#x27;s] difficult relationship with [Po-Wing].&quot; The loud guitar chorus represents Po-Wing&#x27;s &quot;volatile, flamboyant nature&quot;, which contrasts the somber trumpet and slower beat representing Fai&#x27;s sensitivity and steadiness. This song is also linked to Lai&#x27;s loneliness and his longing to be &quot;happy together&quot; while showing the difference between the two characters and the increasing emotional distance between them as the film progresses.

Astor Piazzolla&#x27;s &quot;Prologue (Tango Apasionado)&quot;, &quot;Finale (Tango Apasionado)&quot;, and &quot;Milonga for Three&quot; and similar bandoneon songs play when the couple is both together and apart, representing their relationship. These songs play during romantic scenes such as the taxi scene and the tango in the kitchen. However, it is also played after Fai and Po-Wing break up for the last time and Po-Wing dances the tango with a random man while thinking about when he danced with Fai. The last time this song is played is when Fai reaches the waterfall and the same shot of the Iguazu Falls at the beginning of the film is seen but this time with the &quot;Finale&quot; song. This &quot;eulogizes that relationship&quot; as Po-Wing breaks down in Fai&#x27;s old apartment, realizing that he has abandoned their relationship because Fai left behind the lamp while Fai mourns their relationship at the falls. Wong Kar-wai discovered Piazzolla&#x27;s music when he bought his CDs in the Amsterdam airport on his way to Buenos Aires to film this movie.

&quot;Happy Together&quot;, the Turtles&#x27; song covered by Danny Chung, is the last song to be played in the film, when Fai is on the train in Taipei. This song is used to subvert Western music tropes that use it &quot;to celebrate a budding romance or as an ironic commentary on the lack of such a romance.&quot; It also shows that &quot;Lai is at peace with their relationship, making it a crucial narrative device denoting the meaning of the film.&quot;

While interpretations vary, Wong Kar-wai has said that:

:&quot;In this film, some audiences will say that the title seems to be very cynical, because it is about two persons living together, and at the end, they are just separate. But to me, happy together can apply to two persons or apply to a person and his past, and I think sometimes when a person is at peace with himself and his past, I think it is the beginning of a relationship which can be happy, and also he can be more open to more possibilities in the future with other people.&quot;

== Themes and interpretations ==

=== Nationality, belonging, and cultural identity ===
At the very beginning of the movie, Wong includes shots of Fai&#x27;s British National Overseas Passport as a way to indicate to the audience that this film will be dealing with issues of nationality.

==== The Handover of Hong Kong ====
Released in May 1997, intentionally before the handover of Hong Kong from the British to China on 30 June 1997 after 100 years of colonial rule, the film represents the uncertainty of the future felt by Hongkongers at the time. The film&#x27;s subtitle: &quot;A Story About Reunion&quot; also implies that the film would comment on the handover. The inclusion of the date in the opening and the news broadcast of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s death on 20 February 1997 serve to place the audience explicitly in the time period immediately before the Handover of Hong Kong. Some have suggested that the English title of the film is in relation to the uncertainty around if Hong Kong and China would be &quot;happy together&quot; after their reunion.

In one interpretation, Po-Wing and Fai represent two sides of Hong Kong that cannot be reconciled: Po-Wing stays in Buenos Aires without a passport, like Hong Kong Chinese people who don&#x27;t have a real British passport, representing an &quot;eternal exile and diaspora&quot;. Fai, however, is able to see the waterfall and go to Taiwan but it is not shown whether Fai is able to reconcile with his father or not. Since Po-Wing wants his passport, meaning he wants to leave Buenos Aires, both main characters show that they feel uncertain about their place in the diaspora.

A different interpretation stated that Fai, a gay man, represents the social freedoms that Hongkongers possess and the runaway son who travelled to the other side of the world: Buenos Aires in the film and Britain historically. But, this son (Hong Kong and Fai) &quot;must return and reconcile his differences with old-fashioned China,&quot; which is represented by Fai&#x27;s father. Chang represents Taiwan, a country with a similar past as Hong Kong with China, who comforts Fai (Hong Kong), showing him that there is hope for the future. This hope is demonstrated through the increasing saturation of the film as Fai&#x27;s life becomes more and more stable.

==== Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Buenos Aires ====
Wong&#x27;s choice of Buenos Aires is particular because it is the antipode of Hong Kong, meaning it is on the opposite side of the world and in an opposite time. This had been interpreted as a place where Fai and Po-Wing were looking for the opposite of home and Hong Kong. They do not describe this as a political allegory but rather a questioning of cultural identity and the definitions of &quot;home, belonging, and migrancy&quot;. Another interpretation viewed the scenes of Hong Kong shot upside down not as a political allegory either, but a way to show how far the characters were from their roots.

Similarly, the theme of displacement from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires interestingly emphasizes their similarities rather than their differences when compared to the shots of Hong Kong in Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s previous films. Despite being on the other side of the world and far from their &quot;home&quot;, the couple experiences the same problems, implying the inevitability of their relationship&#x27;s deterioration. By emphasizing the similarities between these two places, Wong emphasizes the homelessness and lack of belonging of both Fai and Po-Wing.

==== Confinement ====
Another theme of the film is the sense of confinement and claustrophobia that accompanies the sense of non-belonging of Fai and Po-Wing. This is conveyed through the shaky handheld camera, the small size, poor lighting, and dirtiness of Fai&#x27;s apartment, the kitchen, alleys, the tango bar, the restaurant kitchen, and the public bathroom corridor. This confinement is also manifested through Po-Wing&#x27;s confinement to Fai&#x27;s apartment because his injured hands prevent him from taking care of himself. Later, Po-Wing is also confined to Buenos Aires because Fai refuses to return his passport. Yet, the imagery of the Iguazu Falls contrasts the theme of confinement with the symbolic openness of possibility and hope for Po-Wing and Fai&#x27;s relationship.

==== Marginalization ====
One interpretation explained that the lack of a sense of belonging due to a combination of their marginal race, sexuality, and language in Buenos Aires and Hong Kong prevented Po-Wing and Fai from forming a stable relationship. This instability is in part shown through the instability of the camera in some shots, relating to the characters&#x27;s inability to find their own place in the world. Neither place is welcoming and the couple experiences the same problems in both places.

The marginalization of Fai specifically is demonstrated by the way he visually cannot blend into the crowds and environments in Buenos Aires in comparison to Taipei. It is only in Taipei that Fai smiles, and it is implied that he feels a sense of belonging as he visits the Chang family noodle shop and takes the train. The movie does not definitively show that Fai returns to Hong Kong, making it possible that he stayed in Taipei, where he feels like he belongs and begins to have hope for the future.

=== The Iguazu Falls and the lamp ===
The importance of the Iguazu Falls is established early on in the film when it is shown on the lamp that Po-Wing bought for Fai and is said to be the entire reason the couple chose to go to Buenos Aires in the first place. The real waterfall is then shown in Fai&#x27;s imaginings after the first breakup as the first shot in colour. It is also shot from a bird&#x27;s-eye view and given unrealistic blue and green colouring, giving it a supernatural visual effect.

One scholar interpreted the representation of the falls as a contemplation on the immensity of mother nature&#x27;s power and the unpredictable nature of the future since the end of the waterfall is imperceivable. It also evokes a feeling of powerlessness in the face of nature and the future, paralleling the inevitability of the deterioration of Po-Wing and Fai&#x27;s relationship.

Another scholar interpreted the waterfall itself as a symbol of Po-Wing and Fai&#x27;s relationship because &quot;their passion is indeed torrential, destructive, always pounding away as it falls head forward and spirals downward towards an uncertain end&quot;.

The falls are seen throughout the film on the lamp in Fai&#x27;s apartment, representing the continued hope and investment in his relationship with Po-Wing. However, when Fai finally visits the Iguazu Falls but without Po-Wing, leaving the lamp behind, Po-Wing understands that Fai has finally abandoned their relationship. Both Fai and Po-Wing mourn their relationship by looking at the waterfall, Fai seeing it in reality, and Po-Wing after having fixed the lamp&#x27;s rotating mechanism.

=== Homosexuality ===
The portrayal of homosexuality in the film is indisputable. On one hand, it is characterized as &quot;one of the best films chronicling gay love ever made&quot; because of the universality of the problems that Fai and Po-Wing face in their relationship that exist in any relationship no matter the gender of the participants. Many scholars and film critics agree that while being gay is not the subject of the film, its portrayal of gay romance is realistic. The film was praised for not casting the characters on gendered lines, questioning their manliness, and showing the complexity of gay men as social beings and individuals.

Wong Kar-wai explained that: &quot;In fact, I don&#x27;t like people to see this film as a gay film. It&#x27;s more like a story about human relationships and somehow the two characters involved are both men. Normally I hate movies with labels like &#x27;gay film,&#x27; &#x27;art film&#x27; or &#x27;commercial film.&#x27; There is only good film and bad film.&quot;On the other hand, some scholars argue that one of the reasons that Po-Wing and Fai ended up in Buenos Aires is because they are gay and are thus exiled homosexual men. Jeremy Tambling, an author and critic, noted that the universalization of the gay relationship is not a positive aspect of the film because it erases the specificity of their experiences and the film&#x27;s theme of marginalization. Furthermore, the film broadly portrays neo-Confucian values of hard work, frugality, and normativity, emphasizing social conformity to Chinese working values. Fai is rewarded for following these values, as he works constantly, cooks, cares for others, wants to reconcile with his father, and saves his money, while Po-Wing lives in excess through his numerous sexual encounters, spending, lack of traditional work, and flamboyance. At the end of the film, Fai is able to reach his destination, Hong Kong/Taiwan and the Iguazu Falls, while Po-Wing is stuck in Buenos Aires. Chang also represents these values, as he works hard at the restaurant, saves enough money for his trip to the &#x27;end of the world,&#x27; and has a loving family to return to in Taipei. The characters who conform to this normativity are rewarded while others are punished, thus emphasizing a narrative wherein gay men &quot;succeed&quot; when conforming to other cultural etiquettes unrelated to their sexualities.

== Legacy ==

Since its release, &quot;Happy Together&quot; has been described as the &quot;most acclaimed gay Asian film&quot;, remaining in the public consciousness.

South African singer, songwriter, and actor Nakhane cited &quot;Happy Together&quot; as one of their three favourite films of all time.

James Laxton, the cinematographer for the critically acclaimed film &quot;Moonlight&quot; (2016), explained in a &quot;Time&quot; article that he was inspired by &quot;Happy Together&quot; and another Wong work, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; (2000). The use of natural and ambient light mixed with small warm fill lights, as well as touches of colour enlightened Laxton to create a &quot;dream-like sense of reality&quot; in his film. More specifically, he cited the scene where Chiron&#x27;s mother scolds him and the pink light emanates from her bedroom as particularly inspired by Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s works.

The 2006 Russian sitcom &quot;Happy Together&quot; took its name from the name of the film.

At the 2017 Golden Horse Awards, &quot;Happy Together&quot; was re-screened in celebration of the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The main promotional poster for the award ceremony used a screenshot from the film of the main actors as well as shots of the Iguazu Falls.

At the 2022 Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, &quot;Happy Together&quot; was re-screened in celebration of the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Rolling Stone magazine called this a &quot;non-official protagonist of the festival&quot;, since the debut documentary film, &quot;&quot;, was premiered in the festival (&quot;Special Nights&quot; section), narrating the encounter with the Hong Kong filmmaker.

<doc id="184994" wikidata="Q582220" url="?curid=184994" title="Caress of Steel">
<text>Caress of Steel is the third studio album by Canadian rock band Rush, released on September 24, 1975, by Mercury Records. It was recorded immediately after the band concluded touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Fly By Night&quot;, and marked a development in the group&#x27;s sound, moving from the blues-based hard rock style of their debut towards progressive rock. &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; is considered Rush&#x27;s first progressive rock album. Songs such as &quot;The Necromancer&quot; furthered Rush&#x27;s advancement into narrative-driven, fantasy-based compositions, while &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth&quot; was their first prog-rock &quot;epic&quot; to span an entire side of vinyl. Other tracks like &quot;Bastille Day&quot; and &quot;Lakeside Park&quot; became staples of the band&#x27;s live setlists.

Though the band members were initially proud of their work on &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;, the album proved to be a commercial and critical nadir for Rush as the album&#x27;s darker sound and fantastical compositions failed to find an audience and confused some of the band&#x27;s peers; further, poor sales put the band in danger of being dropped by Mercury. The mediocre reception impacted the band&#x27;s gigging opportunities, leading them to dub the supporting tour the &quot;Down The Tubes Tour&quot;. Despite being more positively viewed by the band&#x27;s fans in retrospect, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; noted that the album is still considered &quot;the black sheep of their catalog&quot;.

==Background and recording==
By mid-1975, Rush had stabilised with a line-up of guitarist Alex Lifeson, bassist and vocalist Geddy Lee, and drummer and primary lyricist Neil Peart, who had joined the group in 1974. They released &quot;Fly by Night&quot; (1975), which marked Rush&#x27;s first foray into multi-part conceptual songs with &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot;. The group were on a rise in popularity, and received a Juno Award for Most Promising Group. In June 1975, they finished touring &quot;Fly by Night&quot;, which culminated in a Canadian leg that had them as headliners for the first time.

While preparing their follow-up album, Rush took the extended and conceptual song elements that they had introduced on &quot;Fly by Night&quot; and made it the central focus for their new material. As a result, this marked a development in their sound from blues-inspired hard rock towards progressive rock. Peart recalled that the band approached &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; feeling &quot;serene and confident&quot; and that all three members were proud of the result. He considered the album a &quot;major step&quot; in their development with its variety of musical dynamics and original ideas. Lee said that the band were &quot;pretty high&quot; while making the album.

The album was recorded in July 1975 at Toronto Sound Studios in Toronto, Ontario. Mixing took place in the same studio.

==Songs==
===Side one===
&quot;Bastille Day&quot; concerns the storming of the Bastille during the French Revolution.

&quot;I Think I&#x27;m Going Bald&quot; was written in reference to Kim Mitchell, lead guitarist and vocalist for Max Webster who shared management and touring.

&quot;Lakeside Park&quot; is about the park of the same name in Port Dalhousie, St. Catharines, Ontario, where Peart grew up and worked during the summer as a teenager.

&quot;The Necromancer&quot; is a 12-minute track in three parts. It concerns a necromancer, someone who practices necromancy, a type of divination involving the summoning of spirits of the deceased. The song was influenced by the works of author J. R. R. Tolkien; the necromancer is an alias used by the character Sauron in Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1937).

The introduction contains the lyric, &quot;Three travelers, men of Willow Dale&quot;, a reference to the band itself, as Lifeson had formed the first incarnation of Rush in the Toronto suburb of Willowdale. The final section, &quot;Return of the Prince&quot;, sees the return of the character By-Tor from the song &quot;By-Tor and the Snow Dog&quot; on &quot;Fly by Night&quot;, but in &quot;The Necromancer&quot;, the character is a hero and not a villain. &quot;Return of the Prince&quot; was released as a single in Canada.

===Side two===
&quot;The Fountain of Lamneth&quot; is the band&#x27;s first of three side-long tracks, the others being the title track of &quot;2112&quot; in 1976 and &quot;Cygnus X-1, Book II: Hemispheres&quot; from &quot;Hemispheres&quot; in 1978. It consists of six parts and tells the story of a man in search of the Fountain of Lamneth as he chronicles the occurrences on his journey. The second part, &quot;Didacts and Narpets&quot;, consists mostly of a drum solo. In 1991, Peart said that the shouted words heard are an argument between the central character and the Didacts and Narpets (anagrams of &quot;addicts&quot; and &quot;parents&quot;, respectively). He could not remember what the words were, &quot;but they took up opposite positions like: &#x27;Work! Live! Earn! Give!&#x27; and like that.&quot;

==Cover==
The album cover for &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; was intended to be printed in a silver colour to give it a &quot;steel&quot; appearance. A printing error resulted in giving the album cover a gold colour. This error has never been corrected on subsequent printings of the album. The cover artwork for &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; was designed by Hugh Syme, the first Rush album to feature his work. Syme has designed the cover artwork for every Rush album since.

On the inside gatefold of the album, just below the lyrics to &quot;The Necromancer&quot;, the Latin phrase &quot;Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus&quot; appears, which translates (loosely) to:
:&quot;[as] The hour ends the day; the author ends his work.&quot;

The source of this phrase is Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1592).

==Release==
&quot;Caress of Steel&quot; was released on September 24, 1975. By March 1976, it had sold around 40,000 copies in Canada. Although the band initially had high hopes for the album, it sold fewer copies than &quot;Fly by Night&quot; and was considered a disappointment by the record company. The album eventually became known as one of Rush&#x27;s most obscure and overlooked recordings, consequently being considered under-rated by fans.

Due to poor sales, low concert attendance and overall media indifference, the 1975–76 tour supporting &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; became known by the band as the &quot;Down the Tubes&quot; tour. That, in addition to the record company&#x27;s pressure to record more accessible, radio-friendly material similar to their first album – something Lee, Lifeson and Peart were unwilling to do – made the trio fear that the end of the group was near. Ignoring their record label&#x27;s advice and vowing to &quot;fight or fall&quot;, the following year&#x27;s &quot;2112&quot; album would ultimately pave the way for lasting commercial success, despite opening with a 20-and-a-half-minute conceptual title track.

&quot;Caress of Steel&quot; did not attain gold certification in the United States until December 1993, nearly two decades after its release. It remains one of the few Rush albums to not go platinum in the United States.

The complete album, along with the self-titled debut and &quot;Fly by Night&quot;, was included as part of the 1978 Anthem release &quot;Archives.&quot; 

==Reception==
&quot;Caress of Steel&quot; received mixed reviews from professional critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato described the album as &quot;one of Rush&#x27;s more unfocused albums&quot;, while Daily Vault&#x27;s Christopher Thelen called it &quot;a tentative step for Rush, one which would lead to their masterpiece in conceptual work&quot;, in reference to the group&#x27;s next album, &quot;2112&quot;.

== Remasters ==
A remaster was issued on CD in 1997.
* The tray has a picture of the star with man painting (mirroring the cover art of &quot;Retrospective I&quot;) with &quot;The Rush Remasters&quot; printed in all capital letters just to the left. All remasters from &quot;Rush&quot; through &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980) are like this.
* The remaster adds the album&#x27;s back cover and gatefold (which included band pictures and lyrics) to the packaging which was not included on the original CD.

&quot;Caress of Steel&quot; was remastered again in 2011 by Andy VanDette for the &quot;Sector&quot; box sets, which re-released all of Rush&#x27;s Mercury-era albums. &quot;Caress Of Steel&quot; is included in the &quot;Sector 1&quot; set.

&quot;Caress of Steel&quot; was remastered for vinyl in 2015 as a part of the official &quot;12 Months of Rush&quot; promotion. The high definition master prepared for this release was also made available for purchase in 24-bit/96 kHz and 24-bit/192 kHz formats, at several high-resolution audio online music stores. These masters have significantly less dynamic range compression than the 1997 remasters and the &quot;Sector&quot; remasters by Andy VanDette.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart, except where noted.
The cassette track listing varies greatly from the original vinyl release. &quot;Didacts and Narpets&quot; is on side 1, sandwiched between &quot;Bastille Day&quot; and &quot;Lakeside Park.&quot; &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Going Bald&quot; is on side 2, falling in between &quot;In The Valley&quot; and &quot;No One At The Bridge.&quot;

<text>Daniel Paul Johns (born 22 April 1979) is an Australian musician, singer, and songwriter, best known as the frontman, guitarist, and main songwriter of the rock band Silverchair. Johns is also one half of The Dissociatives with Paul Mac and one half of Dreams with Luke Steele. On March 13, 2015 Johns released his first solo EP &quot;Aerial Love&quot; and on March 22, 2015, he released his first solo LP &quot;Talk&quot; in 2015. Johns&#x27; second solo album &quot;FutureNever&quot; was released on 22 April 2022.

In 2007, Johns was ranked at number 18 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 25 Most Underrated Guitarists. Johns has won 21 ARIA Awards from 49 nominations as a member of Silverchair, and has earned four other nominations as a solo artist.

==Early life and education ==
Daniel Paul Johns was born Newcastle, New South Wales on 22 April 1979 to Greg and Julie Johns. His father owned a fruit shop in Newcastle, and his mother was a full-time homemaker. He grew up in Merewether, with two younger siblings.

Johns attended Newcastle High School, from which he graduated in 1997.

==Career==
===Silverchair (1992–2011)===
At the age of 12, Johns and school friends Ben Gillies and Chris Joannou formed a band, originally named &quot;The Innocent Criminals&quot;, and practiced daily after school for periods of four hours or more.

The band&#x27;s career began when the three members were 15 years old when a demo recording of their song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; won a competition that was run by the SBS TV programme &quot;Nomad&quot;. The group, now named Silverchair, subsequently accepted a three-album deal from Sony Music in 1994, and the label hurriedly released their first album &quot;Frogstomp&quot; in 1995 after &quot;Tomorrow&quot; remained in the No. 1 position on the Australian singles chart for six weeks.

The band released &quot;Freak Show&quot; in 1997, followed by &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; in 1999, and then &quot;Diorama&quot; in 2002. Following &quot;Diorama&quot;, Silverchair embarked on a lengthy hiatus before the release of the next album.

In late 2005, Johns and Silverchair reunited and announced the production of a new album entitled &quot;Young Modern&quot;, whose title comes from a nickname given to Johns by composer Van Dyke Parks. The new album was released on 31 March 2007 and was followed by the Across the Great Divide tour with fellow Australian band Powderfinger.

In May 2011, Silverchair announced on their website that the band was going into &quot;indefinite hibernation&quot; and explained that &quot;it&#x27;s become increasingly clear that the spark simply isn&#x27;t there between the three of us at the moment&quot;. Later that month, Johns and filmmaker Josh Wakely presented a talk at TEDx Sydney in which they discussed a film that they were working on that was tentatively titled &quot;My Mind&#x27;s Own Melody&quot;. A video of the talk was uploaded to YouTube in June 2011, and a trailer for the completed film was released in mid-2012.

===&quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Rock&quot; and The Dissociatives (2000–2004)===
During the post-&quot;Diorama&quot; hiatus, Johns worked on several side projects, the most notable being The Dissociatives with dance musician/producer Paul Mac. Johns and Mac worked together since Mac&#x27;s 1997 remix of &quot;Freak&quot; and his contribution to &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;. In 2000, they recorded a five-track EP &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s Not Rock&quot;. Their debut album &quot;The Dissociatives&quot; (2004) was initially recorded in London, United Kingdom, and a few months later, the two regrouped in Sydney and Newcastle to finish off the project. The Dissociatives toured with musicians Kim Moyes on drums, Julian Hamilton on keys, and James Haselwood on bass.

===Collaborations===
On 13 June 2008, it was reported on Silverchair&#x27;s website that Johns was working on a new side project with Luke Steele (The Sleepy Jackson, Empire of the Sun), but a release date was not confirmed for the collaboration. In 2008, the name of the project was &quot;Hathaway and Palmer,&quot; according to a radio interview that Steele conducted, but this has not been confirmed since.

In December 2008, Johns was named as the producer of The Scare&#x27;s album.

In 2012, Johns collaborated with the Australian Chamber Orchestra to create the soundtrack &quot;Atlas&quot; for a Qantas Airlines commercial that began airing a week before the 2012 Olympics. Johns explained:

When Qantas first approached me, I agreed to the project as I was really into the idea of creating a piece of music that represented Australia. I wanted it to sound big, something special. It was a conscious effort to create a good piece of music and not just a jingle. I&#x27;ve also wanted to work with the Australian Chamber Orchestra for a long time now, so it was great to finally be able to do that.

In May 2012, Johns wrote and recorded music with pop duo The Veronicas for the latter&#x27;s third album. The writing process began in November 2011, and the twin sisters stated that working with Johns &quot;was one of our greatest experiences.&quot;

As of January 2013, Johns was scheduled to appear in a live performance with Van Dyke Parks as part of the Adelaide Festival on 8 March 2013 and was also rumoured to be working on a debut solo album. In May 2013, Steele revealed that he and Johns were completing the project that they had started in 2008.

In January 2014, Johns co-wrote the song &quot;Impossible&quot;, released by Australian rapper 360, and also sang on the song&#x27;s chorus. Johns met 360 through his brother Heath, who is also 360&#x27;s publisher.

In 2016, Johns was a musical director and arranged and produced the music for the Netflix animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Beat Bugs&quot;. He was also the singing voice for the characters Walter, and Mr. Mudwasp. He stated, &quot;It&#x27;s a dream job to go into the studio and dissect all of The Beatles&#x27; music&quot;. Johns said that Eddie Vedder liked his version with the guide vocals for &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; so much that he kept Johns&#x27;s backing vocals in the finished song.

In May 2016 Johns collaborated with Perth duo Slumberjack on their track &quot;Open Fire&quot;, and also featured in the music video. In the same year he co-wrote and provided uncredited backing vocals to &#x27;Say It&#x27; from Flume&#x27;s &quot;Skin&quot; LP.

Johns has also worked with artists such as Zhu in the track &quot;Modern Conversation&quot; in 2017 and fellow Australian artist What So Not in the album &quot;Not All The Beautiful Things&quot;, released in 2018, where he contributed to a good portion of the music.

Johns premiered the band &#x27;Boom Tish&#x27; back in 2017. They&#x27;ve released just one song, a cover of the Easybeats&#x27; &#x27;Hello, How Are You&#x27;. However, band members Beau Golden and Dave Jenkins Jnr both posted new photos of Boom Tish in the studio in January 2020. Boom Tish evolved out of Johns&#x27; live band for his consecutive Sydney Opera House shows in 2015.

Johns teamed up with Luke Steele from Empire of the Sun to form Dreams, releasing the single &quot;No One Defeats Us&quot; in March 2018. Dreams&#x27; debut album, &quot;No One Defeats Us&quot;, was released in September 2018 through EMI.

===Solo career (2013–present)===
In November 2013, it was reported by various media outlets that Johns was in the process of working on a solo album due for release sometime in 2014. His manager John Watson was quoted as saying: &quot;it&#x27;s looking extremely likely that it&#x27;ll be out next year.&quot;

For the 40th birthday of the Triple J radio station, Beat the Drum, held at The Domain, Sydney, on 16 January 2015, Johns performed a piano version of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;.

Johns debuted a new song as a solo artist on 29 January 2015 on Triple J. Titled &quot;Aerial Love&quot;, Peter Vincent, National Music Editor of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, described the song as &quot;sexy&quot; and &quot;soulful&quot;. &quot;Aerial Love&quot; debuted at No. 50 on the Australian Singles Chart, later peaking at No. 21. Johns released his fifteen-track debut album as a solo artist on 22 May 2015, entitled &quot;Talk&quot;. The record features multilayered arrangements of R&amp;B, soul, synthpop, and electronic melodies. &quot;Talk&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia within the first two weeks of its release. The album also achieved some unexpected success in other parts of the world, coming in at No. 1 on the Slovakian iTunes albums chart shortly after release.

In October 2021, Johns released a Spotify Original Podcast, &quot;Who Is Daniel Johns?&quot;, of which he is both the host and subject. The five-part podcast, produced by Kaitlyn Sawrey, Amelia Chappelow and Frank Lopez, features interviews with key figures in Johns&#x27; life, including ex-wife Natalie Imbruglia, Paul Mac, Van Dyke Parks and Billy Corgan. &quot;Who Is Daniel Johns?&quot; became Spotify&#x27;s most popular podcast in Australia. In an October 2021 interview on Network 10&#x27;s &quot;The Project&quot; to promote the podcast, Johns said that while he still plans to work on new music, he may never play live again.

On 7 December 2021, Johns announced via a personal letter to fans that his second solo album, &quot;FutureNever&quot;, would be released on 1 April 2022; however, this was later pushed back to 22 April. The album was made available for pre-order on the FutureNever.art website. &quot;FutureNever&quot; is the first album Johns released on his own label via a new global deal with BMG.

==Legal issues ==
On 28 October 2014, Johns was stopped by police when they spotted his black Jaguar travelling at a speed of between along Morgan Street in Merewether, which is governed by a speed limit of . Johns, who was arrested for driving under the influence, told police that he had consumed four large glasses of wine. He reappeared in Newcastle Local Court in February 2015 and was convicted of mid-range drunk driving, receiving an $880 fine and disqualification from driving until June 2015, and was required to attend a traffic offenders course. 

In March 2022, Johns was again charged with a DUI (this time in the high range, testing 0.157, more than three times the legal limit) after his SUV crossed to the wrong side of the Pacific Highway at North Arm Cove and collided with a van travelling in the opposite direction. A woman passenger of the van was hospitalised, but there were no serious injuries and she was released from the hospital that same night. Johns said he had been medicating with alcohol to deal with his PTSD, anxiety and depression, and he would be admitting himself to a rehabilitation centre. On 7 July 2022, he was sentenced. The judge said the charge was serious, but Johns&#x27; background and circumstances were exceptional, and gave him a relatively light punishment by disqualifying him from driving for seven months and a 10-month intensive corrections order.

On 11 August 2019, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; published a false story about Johns, alleging that he had been spending his time at a notorious Sydney S&amp;M brothel and bondage club called The Kastle. Johns denied the allegations and sued &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for defamation. The &quot;Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s publisher, News Corp, paid Johns a $470,000 settlement. &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; issued a retraction and apology to Johns on 3 May 2020. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; issued a retraction and apology on 8 August 2020:

==Personal life==
=== Health ===
In late 1997, during the &quot;Freak Show&quot; tour, Johns experienced depression. In 2004, Johns spoke at length to ABC interviewer Andrew Denton about his battle with anorexia nervosa at that time, saying that he weighed less than at his thinnest. He also revealed that at one point he had considered suicide. However he was by then married to singer Natalie Imbruglia, who provided him with emotional support, and he was healthy.

After recording &quot;Diorama&quot;, Johns was diagnosed with a rare but serious case of reactive arthritis. After treatment in Los Angeles, he was able to tour with the band for the &quot;Across the Night&quot; Tour.

After putting Silverchair into &quot;indefinite hibernation&quot; in 2011, Johns retreated to his home in Merewether, later stating &quot;I felt like I was losing who I was&quot;. He checked the surf conditions obsessively every morning even though he hadn&#x27;t surfed since his teens. By his own admission, he spent four years hiding and shutting things out. He kept company with his shar-pei–whippet crossbred dog named Gia, watched movies with the blinds closed, and ordered online grocery deliveries.

=== Animal rights ===
Johns is known for his animal rights support, having revealed that he was a vegan in 1998, although it was stated that he was a pescetarian in 2009. The &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; song &quot;Spawn Again&quot; features Johns&#x27; views on animal liberation.

=== Relationships===
In 1999, Johns met Australian actress, singer, and model Natalie Imbruglia backstage at a Silverchair concert in London. They started dating after meeting again at the ARIA awards after-party at the Gazebo Hotel in Sydney in October of the same year. After years of an on-and-off relationship, Johns announced their engagement shortly before Christmas 2002, and they married on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2003. Johns wrote the song &quot;Satisfied&quot; for Imbruglia&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Counting Down the Days&quot;, which he also produced, and co-wrote the song &quot;Want&quot; from Imbruglia&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Come to Life&quot;. Imbruglia wrote her 2005 single &quot;Counting Down the Days&quot; about their long-distance relationship, as Imbruglia was based in London and Johns in Newcastle. On 4 January 2008, they announced that they were divorcing, stating, &quot;We have simply grown apart through not being able to spend enough time together.&quot;

In 2008, Johns was dating Australian model Louise Van der Vorst. In 2009, the couple moved from Australia to New York City so that Van der Vorst could expand her modelling career. By July 2011, the couple were living together in Newcastle, Australia. They split in 2012.

Johns commenced a relationship with former model Michelle Leslie in October 2016. They broke up in 2019.

<text>Extreme Ironing (also called EI) is an extreme sport in which people take ironing boards to remote locations and iron items of clothing. According to the Extreme Ironing Bureau, extreme ironing is &quot;the latest dangerous sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well-pressed shirt.&quot;

Part of the attraction and interest the media has shown towards extreme ironing seems to center on the issue of whether it is really a sport or not. It is widely considered to be tongue-in-cheek.

Some locations where such performances have taken place include a mountainside of a difficult climb; a forest; in a canoe; while skiing or snowboarding; on top of large bronze statues; in the middle of a street; underwater; in the middle of the M1 motorway; in a keirin cycle race; while parachuting; and under the ice sheet of a frozen lake. The performances have been conducted solo or by groups.

==History==
Extreme ironing was invented in 1997 in Leicester, England, by resident Phil Shaw in his back garden. Shaw came home from what he recalls as a hard day in a Leicester knitwear factory. Shaw had a number of chores to do, including ironing. Preferring the idea of an evening out rock climbing, he decided to combine the two activities into a new extreme sport. In June 1999, Shaw, who uses the nickname &quot;Steam&quot;, embarked on an international tour to promote the activity. The stops included the United States, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. An encounter with German tourists in New Zealand led to the formation of a group called &quot;Extreme Ironing International&quot;, and the German Extreme Ironing Section or GEIS. This has yet to popularize in North America.

A more extreme form of extreme ironing has been developed that includes bungee jumping. Bungee ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing.

The first competition for extreme ironing took place in Germany in 2002. Eighty teams competed in an obstacle course in which the competitors had to iron different articles of clothing in different dangerous settings. These settings included hanging from a tree, scaling a wall, and climbing under the hood of a car. A common misconception would be that competitors are scored only on how dangerous the location of their ironing is. But, the most significant part of scoring is actually how many wrinkles are left on the clothing and how the competitor chooses to iron the clothes. Competitors are scored for the quality of the pressing, style, and speed. Quality of the pressing counts for half of the points scored. 

The sport gained international attention in 2003 after a documentary entitled &quot;Extreme Ironing: Pressing for Victory&quot;, was produced for Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 by Wag TV. The program followed the British team&#x27;s efforts and eventual Bronze and Gold placings in the 1st Extreme Ironing World Championships in Germany. A side-story looked at the rivalry between the EIB (Extreme Ironing Bureau) and a breakaway group called Urban Housework who were trying to establish their own extreme sport based around vacuum-cleaning. The film later aired on the National Geographic Channel.

In 2003, John Roberts and Ben Gibbons from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire and Christopher Allan Jowsey (boots) from Newcastle, Whitley Bay, ironed a Union Jack just above Everest Base Camp. This is believed to be the world altitude record for the sport. The reported height was above sea level.

In 2003, the Rowenta Trophy was won by a group from South Africa by ironing across a gorge at the Wolfberg Cracks.

In 2004, the EIB traveled to the US on the Rowenta Tour to recruit additional ironists and ironed at Mount Rushmore, New York City, Boston and Devils Tower.

On 18 April 2011, tenor Jason Blair was filmed ironing on the M1 motorway in London, UK, a section of which had been closed following a fire.

In 2012, Extreme Ironing pioneer Steam came out of retirement to take on a new challenge and run the Hastings Half Marathon in March wearing an ironing board, pressing garments on the way.

===Underwater===

In March 2008, a team of 72 divers simultaneously ironing underwater set a new world&#x27;s record for number of people ironing underwater at once.

On 10 January 2009, 128 divers including six freedivers, attempted to break the previous world record, managing to confirm 86 divers ironing within a 10-minute period. The event took place at the National Diving and Activity Centre (NDAC) near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, and was organised by members of the Yorkshire Divers internet forum. In addition to breaking the world record, the event raised over £15000 for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.

On 1 May 2010, a group of Dive Centers in Key Largo, Florida, attempted to claim the record. The event was part of the Conch Republic Days in the Florida Keys and was attempted by Keys Diver, Silent World Dive Center, and Captain Slates Atlantis Dive Center. The attempt took place at the historic site of the Christ of the Abyss at Key Largo Dry Rocks.

On 28 March 2011, Dutch diving club De Waterman from Oss, Netherlands, set the new (official) world record extreme underwater ironing. A group of 173 divers set the new world record in an indoor swimming pool in Oss. De Waterman organized this event to mark their 40-year anniversary.

On 16 June 2018, a freediver, Roland Piccoli, ironed a T-shirt at a depth of 42 m (138 ft) in the world&#x27;s deepest pool (Y-40) in Montegrotto Terme Italy.

===Related activities===
Extreme Ironing has inspired other forms of unusual extreme activity, such as Extreme Cello Playing.

==In popular culture==
The activity rose high enough in the zeitgeist to land an appearance on the long-running soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The 2 August 2004 episode featured a reference to the then-current altitude record holders the Hot Plate Brothers. As the party-loving Kat and Zoe Slater are preparing to go out, they are invited to the launch party at Angie&#x27;s Den where celebrities—including the brothers—are supposed to appear.

It is also mentioned in Netflix’s show &quot;Dino Girl Gauko&quot; Season 1, Episode 6.

<text>The Seminole are a Native American people who developed in Florida in the 18th century. Today, they live in Oklahoma and Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups. The Seminole people emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Spanish Florida beginning in the early 1700s, most significantly northern Muscogee Creeks from what are now Georgia and Alabama.

Old crafts and traditions were revived in both Florida and Oklahoma in the mid-20th century as the Seminole began seeking revenue from tourists traveling along the new interstate highway system. In the 1970s, Seminole tribes began to run small bingo games on their reservations to raise revenue. They won court challenges to initiate Indian gaming on their sovereign land. Many U.S. tribes have likewise adopted this practice where state laws have gambling, in order to generate revenues for welfare, education, and development.

Since the late 20th century, the Seminole Tribe of Florida has been particularly successful with gambling establishments, attracting many of the numerous tourists to the state. In 2007 it purchased the Hard Rock Café and has rebranded or opened several casinos and gaming resorts under that name. These include two large resorts on its Tampa and Hollywood reservations; together these projects cost more than a billion dollars to construct.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Seminole&quot; may be derived from the Creek word &quot;simanó-li&quot;. This has been variously translated as &quot;frontiersman&quot;, &quot;outcast&quot;, &quot;runaway&quot;, &quot;separatist&quot;, and similar words. The Creek word may be derived from the Spanish word &quot;cimarrón&quot;, meaning &quot;runaway&quot; or &quot;wild one&quot;, historically used for certain Native American groups in Florida.

The name &quot;Seminole&quot; likely is derived from the Spanish , meaning &quot;wild or untamed&quot;, as opposed to the christianized natives who had previously lived in the mission villages of Spanish Florida (In the 17th century the Spanish in Florida used &quot;cimaron&quot; to refer to christianized natives who had left their mission villages to live &quot;wild&quot; in the woods.). Some of the Hitchiti- or Mikasukee-speakers who had settled in Florida identified themselves to the British as &quot;cimallon&quot; (Muskogean languages have no &quot;r&quot; sound, replacing it with &quot;l&quot;). The British wrote the name as &quot;Semallone&quot;, later &quot;Seminole&quot;. The use of &quot;cimallon&quot; by bands in Florida to describe themselves may have been intended to distinguish themselves from the primarily Muskogee-speakers of the Upper Towns of the Muscogee Confederacy (called the &quot;Creek Confederacy&quot; by the British). After 1763, when they took over Florida from the Spanish, the British called all natives living in Florida &quot;Seminoles&quot;, &quot;Creeks&quot;, or &quot;Seminole-Creeks&quot;.

== Culture ==
The people who constituted the nucleus of this Florida group either chose to leave their tribe or were banished. At one time, the terms &quot;renegade&quot; and &quot;outcast&quot; were used to describe this status, but the terms have fallen into disuse due to their negative connotations. The Seminole identify as &quot;yat&#x27;siminoli&quot; or &quot;free people&quot; because for centuries their ancestors had successfully resisted efforts to subdue or convert them to Roman Catholicism. They signed several treaties with the U.S. government, including the Treaty of Moultrie Creek and the Treaty of Paynes Landing.

Seminole culture is largely derived from that of the Creek. One of the more significant holdovers from the Creek was the Green Corn Dance ceremony. Other notable traditions include use of the black drink and ritual tobacco. As the Seminoles adapted to Florida environs, they developed local traditions, such as the construction of open-air, thatched-roof houses known as &quot;chickees&quot;. Historically the Seminoles spoke Mikasuki and Creek, both Muskogean languages.

==History==
===Origins===
Florida had been the home of several indigenous cultures prior to the arrival of European explorers in the early 1500s. However, the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases, along with conflict with Spanish colonists, led to a drastic decline of Florida&#x27;s original native population. By the early 1700s, much of &quot;La Florida&quot; was uninhabited apart from Spanish colonial towns at St. Augustine and Pensacola. A stream of mainly Muscogee Creek began moving into the territory at that time to escape conflict with English colonists to the north and established their own towns, mainly in the Florida panhandle.

Native American refugees from northern wars, such as the Yuchi and Yamasee after the Yamasee War in South Carolina, migrated into Spanish Florida in the early 18th century. More arrived in the second half of the 18th century, as the Lower Creeks, part of the Muscogee people, began to migrate from several of their towns into Florida to evade the dominance of the Upper Creeks and pressure from encroaching colonists from the Province of Carolina. They spoke primarily Hitchiti, of which Mikasuki is a dialect. This is the primary traditional language spoken today by the Miccosukee in Florida. Also fleeing to Florida were African Americans who had escaped from slavery in the Southern Colonies.

The new arrivals moved into virtually uninhabited lands that had once been peopled by several cultures indigenous to Florida, such as the Apalachee, Timucua, Calusa and others. The native population had been devastated by infectious diseases brought by Spanish explorers in the 1500s and later colonization by additional European settlers. Later, raids by Carolina and Native American slavers destroyed the string of Spanish missions across northern Florida. Most of the survivors left for Cuba when the Spanish withdrew, after ceding Florida to the British in 1763, following Britain&#x27;s victory in the French and Indian War. 

While John Swanton stated in the mid-20th century that the Seminole encountered and absorbed the Calusa who had remained in southwest Florida after the Spanish withdrew, more recent scholarship since the turn of the 21st century holds that there is no documentary evidence of that assertion.

===1700s to early 1800s===
As they established themselves in northern and peninsular Florida throughout the 1700s, the various new arrivals intermingled with each other and with the few remaining indigenous people. In a process of ethnogenesis, they constructed a new culture which they called &quot;Seminole&quot;, a derivative of the &quot;Mvskoke&quot;&#x27; (a Creek language) word &quot;simano-li&quot;, an adaptation of the Spanish &quot;cimarrón&quot; which means &quot;wild&quot; (in their case, &quot;wild men&quot;), or &quot;runaway&quot; [men]. The Seminole were a heterogeneous tribe made up of mostly Lower Creeks from Georgia, who by the time of the Creek War (1813–1814) numbered about 4,000 in Florida. At that time, numerous refugees of the Red Sticks migrated south, adding about 2,000 people to the population. They were Creek-speaking Muscogee, and were the ancestors of most of the later Creek-speaking Seminole. In addition, a few hundred escaped African-American slaves (known as the Black Seminoles) had settled near the Seminole towns and, to a lesser extent, Native Americans from other tribes, and some white Americans. The unified Seminole spoke two languages: Creek and Mikasuki (mutually intelligible with its dialect Hitchiti), two among the Muskogean languages family. Creek became the dominant language for political and social discourse, so Mikasuki speakers learned it if participating in high-level negotiations. The Muskogean language group includes Choctaw and Chickasaw, associated with two other major Southeastern tribes.

In part due to the arrival of Native Americans from other cultures, the Seminole became increasingly independent of other Creek groups and established their own identity through ethnogenesis. They developed a thriving trade network by the time of the British and second Spanish periods (roughly 1767–1821). The tribe expanded considerably during this time, and was further supplemented from the late 18th century by escaped slaves from Southern plantations who settled near and paid tribute to Seminole towns. The latter became known as Black Seminoles, although they kept many facets of their own Gullah culture.

During the colonial years, the Seminole were on relatively good terms with both the Spanish and the British. In 1784, after the American Revolutionary War, Britain came to a settlement with Spain and transferred East and West Florida to it. 

The Spanish Empire&#x27;s decline enabled the Seminole to settle more deeply into Florida. They were led by a dynasty of chiefs of the Alachua chiefdom, founded in eastern Florida in the 18th century by Cowkeeper. Beginning in 1825, Micanopy was the principal chief of the unified Seminole, until his death in 1849, after removal to Indian Territory. This chiefly dynasty lasted past Removal, when the US forced the majority of Seminole to move from Florida to the Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma) after the Second Seminole War. Micanopy&#x27;s sister&#x27;s son, John Jumper, succeeded him in 1849 and, after his death in 1853, his brother Jim Jumper became principal chief. He was in power through the American Civil War, after which the U.S. government began to interfere with tribal government, supporting its own candidate for chief.

After raids by Anglo-American colonists on Seminole settlements in the mid-18th century, the Seminole retaliated by raiding the Southern Colonies (primarily Georgia), purportedly at the behest of the Spanish. The Seminoles also maintained a tradition of accepting escaped slaves from Southern plantations, infuriating planters in the American South by providing a route for their slaves to escape bondage.

After the United States achieved independence, the U.S. Army and local militia groups made increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish Florida to recapture escaped slaves living among the Seminole. American general Andrew Jackson&#x27;s 1817–1818 campaign against the Seminoles became known as the First Seminole War. Though Spain decried the incursions into its territory, the United States effectively controlled the Florida panhandle after the war.

===Seminole Wars===

In 1819, the United States and Spain signed the Adams-Onís Treaty, which took effect in 1821. According to its terms, the United States acquired Florida and, in exchange, renounced all claims to Texas. President James Monroe appointed Andrew Jackson as military governor of Florida. As European American colonization increased after the treaty, colonists pressured the federal government to remove Natives from Florida. Slaveholders resented that tribes harbored runaway black slaves, and more colonists wanted access to desirable lands held by Native Americans. Georgian slaveholders wanted the &quot;maroons&quot; and fugitive slaves living among the Seminoles, known today as Black Seminoles, returned to slavery.

After acquisition by the U.S. of Florida in 1821, many American slaves and Black Seminoles frequently escaped from Cape Florida to the British colony of the Bahamas, settling mostly on Andros Island. Contemporary accounts noted a group of 120 migrating in 1821, and a much larger group of 300 enslaved African Americans escaping in 1823. The latter were picked up by Bahamians in 27 sloops and also by travelers in canoes. They developed a village known as Red Bays on Andros.

Under colonists&#x27; pressure, the U.S. government made the 1823 Treaty of Camp Moultrie with the Seminoles, seizing 24 million acres in northern Florida. They offered the Seminoles a much smaller reservation in the Everglades, of about . They and the Black Seminoles moved into central and southern Florida.

In 1832, the U.S. government signed the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing with a few of the Seminole chiefs. They promised lands west of the Mississippi River if the chiefs agreed to leave Florida voluntarily with their people. The Seminoles who remained prepared for war. White colonists continued to press for their removal.

In 1835, the U.S. Army arrived to enforce the treaty. The Seminole leader Osceola led the vastly outnumbered resistance during the Second Seminole War. Drawing on a population of about 4,000 Seminoles and 800 allied Black Seminoles, he mustered at most 1,400 warriors (President Andrew Jackson estimated they had only 900). They countered combined U.S. Army and militia forces that ranged from 6,000 troops at the outset to 9,000 at the peak of deployment in 1837. To survive, the Seminole allies employed guerrilla tactics with devastating effect against U.S. forces, as they knew how to move within the Everglades and use this area for their protection. Osceola was arrested (in a breach of honor) when he came under a flag of truce to negotiations with the US in 1837. He died in jail less than a year later. He was decapitated, his body buried without his head.

Other war chiefs, such as Halleck Tustenuggee and John Jumper, and the Black Seminoles Abraham and John Horse, continued the Seminole resistance against the army. After a full decade of fighting, the war ended in 1842. Scholars estimate the U.S. government spent about $40,000,000 on the war, at the time a huge sum. An estimated 3,000 Seminoles and 800 Black Seminoles were forcibly exiled to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi, where they were settled on the Creek reservation. After later skirmishes in the Third Seminole War (1855–1858), perhaps 200 survivors retreated deep into the Everglades to land that was not desired by settlers. They were finally left alone and they never surrendered.

Several treaties seem to bear the mark of representatives of the Seminole tribe, including the Treaty of Moultrie Creek and the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing. The Florida Seminoles say they are the only tribe in America never to have signed a peace treaty with the U.S. government.

==American Civil War==
During the American Civil War, the Confederate government of Florida offered aid to keep the Seminoles from fighting on the side of the Union. The Florida House of Representatives established a Committee on Indian Affairs in 1862 but, aside from appointing a representative to negotiate with the Seminole tribe, failed to follow its promises of aid. The lack of aid, along with the growing number of Federal troops and pro-unionists in the state, led the Seminoles to remain officially neutral throughout the war. In July 1864, Secretary of War James A. Seddon received word that a man named A. McBride had raised a company of sixty-five Seminole who had volunteered to fight for the Confederacy. McBride claimed to have an understanding of Florida because of the time he had spent there fighting during the Seminole wars. While McBride never put such a company in the field, this letter shows how the Confederacy attempted to use Seminole warriors against the Union.

Other leaders, such as Halleck Tustenuggee and Sonuk Mikko (Billy Bowlegs), refused to sign, withdrew from Florida, and joined with the Union.

After the war, the United States government declared void all prior treaties with the Seminoles of Indian Country because of the &quot;disloyalty&quot; of some in allying with the Confederacy. They required new peace treaties, establishing such conditions as reducing the power of tribal councils, providing freedom or tribal membership for Black Seminoles (at the same time that enslaved African Americans were being emancipated in the South), and forced concessions of tribal land for railroads and other development.

===Post-Seminole Wars and the 20th century===

The 1868 Florida Constitution, developed by the Reconstruction legislature, gave the Seminoles one seat in the house and one seat in the senate of the state legislature. The Seminoles never filled the positions. After white Democrats regained control over the legislature, they removed this provision from the post-Reconstruction constitution they ratified in 1885. In the early 20th century, the Florida Seminoles re-established limited relations with the U.S. government. The Seminoles maintained a thriving trade business with white merchants during this period, selling alligator hides, bird plumes, and other items sourced from the Everglades. Then, in 1906, Governor Napoleon B. Broward began an effort to drain the Everglades in attempt to convert the wetlands into farmland. The plan to drain the Everglades, new federal and state laws ending the plume trade, and the start of World War I (which put a halt to international fashion trade), all contributed to a major decline in the demand for Seminole goods.

In 1930, they received of reservation lands. Few Seminoles moved to these reservations until the 1940s. They reorganized their government and received federal recognition in 1957 as the Seminole Tribe of Florida. During this process, the more traditional people near the Tamiami Trail defined themselves as independent. They received federal recognition as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians in Florida in 1962.

During World War II, roughly sixty-five Seminoles fled into the Everglades to avoid registering for the draft. The superintendent of the Seminole Indian agency in Dania was able to convince all but two of the group to eventually register. 

In the 1950s, the Oklahoma and Florida Seminole tribes filed land claim suits, claiming they had not received adequate compensation for their lands. Their suits were combined in the government&#x27;s settlement of 1976. The Seminole tribes and Traditionals took until 1990 to negotiate an agreement as to division of the settlement, a judgment trust against which members can draw for education and other benefits. The Florida Seminoles founded a high-stakes bingo game on their reservation in the late 1970s, winning court challenges to initiate Native American gaming, which many tribes have adopted to generate revenues for welfare, education, and development.

After removal, the Seminoles in Oklahoma and Florida had little official contact until well into the 20th century. They developed along similar lines as the groups strove to maintain their culture while struggling economically. Most Seminoles in Indian Territory lived on tribal lands centered in what is now Seminole County of the state of Oklahoma. The implementation of the Dawes Rolls in the late 1890s parceled out tribal lands in preparation for the admission of Oklahoma as a state, reducing most Seminoles to subsistence farming on small individual homesteads. While some tribe members left the territory to seek better opportunities, most remained. Today, residents of the reservation are enrolled in the federally recognized Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, while others belong to unorganized groups. The Florida Seminole re-established limited relations with the U.S. government in the early 1900s and were officially granted of reservation land in south Florida in 1930. Members gradually moved to the land, and they reorganized their government and received federal recognition as the Seminole Tribe of Florida in 1957. The more traditional people living near the Tamiami Trail received federal recognition as the Miccosukee Tribe in 1962.

==Political and social organization==
The Seminoles were organized around &quot;itálwa&quot;, the basis of their social, political and ritual systems, and roughly equivalent to towns or bands in English. They had a matrilineal kinship system, in which children are considered born into their mother&#x27;s family and clan, and property and hereditary roles pass through the maternal line. Males held the leading political and social positions. Each &quot;itálwa&quot; had civil, military and religious leaders; they were self-governing throughout the nineteenth century, but would cooperate for mutual defense. The &quot;itálwa&quot; continued to be the basis of Seminole society in Oklahoma into the 21st century.

==Languages==
Historically, the various groups of Seminoles spoke two mutually unintelligible Muskogean languages: Mikasuki (and its dialect, Hitchiti) and Muscogee. Mikasuki is now restricted to Florida, where it was the native language of 1,600 people as of 2000, primarily the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is working to revive the use of Creek among its people, as it had been the dominant language of politics and social discourse.

Muscogee is spoken by some Oklahoma Seminoles and about 200 older Florida Seminoles. The youngest native speaker was born in 1960. Today, English is the predominant language among both Oklahoma and Florida Seminoles, particularly the younger generations. Most Mikasuki speakers are bilingual.

==Ethnobotany==
The Seminole use the spines of &quot;Cirsium horridulum&quot; (also called bristly thistle) to make blowgun darts.

==Music==
==Contemporary==

During the Seminole Wars, the Seminole people began to divide among themselves due to the conflict and differences in ideology. The Seminole population had also been growing significantly, though it was diminished by the wars. With the division of the Seminole population between Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and Florida, they still maintained some common traditions, such as powwow trails and ceremonies. In general, the cultures grew apart in their markedly different circumstances, and had little contact for a century.

The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, and the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, described below, are federally recognized, independent nations that operate in their own spheres.

===Religion===
Seminole tribes generally follow Christianity, both Protestantism and Catholicism. They also observe their traditional Native religion, which is expressed through the stomp dance and the Green Corn Ceremony held at their ceremonial grounds. Indigenous peoples have practiced Green Corn rituals for centuries. Contemporary southeastern Native American tribes, such as the Seminole and Muscogee Creek, still practice these ceremonies. As converted Christian Seminoles established their own churches, they incorporated their traditions and beliefs into a syncretic indigenous-Western practice. For example, Seminole hymns sung in the indigenous (Muscogee) language are inclusive of key Muscogee language terms (for example, the Muscogee term &quot;mekko&quot; or chief conflates with &quot;Jesus&quot;). Also, hymns are frequently led by a song leader (a traditional indigenous song practice).

In the 1950s, federal projects in Florida encouraged the tribe&#x27;s reorganization. They created organizations within tribal governance to promote modernization. As Christian pastors began preaching on reservations, Green Corn Ceremony attendance decreased. This created tension between religiously traditional Seminoles and those who began adopting Christianity. In the 1960s and 1970s, some tribal members on reservations, such as the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Florida, viewed organized Christianity as a threat to their traditions.

By the 1980s, Seminole communities were even more concerned about loss of language and tradition. Many tribal members began to revive the observance of traditional Green Corn Dance ceremonies, and some shifted away from Christian observance. By 2000, religious tension between Green Corn Dance attendees and Christians (particularly Baptists) decreased. Some Seminole families participate in both religions; these practitioners have developed a syncretic Christianity that has absorbed some tribal traditions.

==Land claims==
In 1946, the Department of Interior established the Indian Claims Commission, to consider compensation for tribes that claimed their lands were seized by the federal government during times of conflict. Tribes seeking settlements had to file claims by August 1961, and both the Oklahoma and Florida Seminoles did so. After combining their claims, the Commission awarded the Seminole a total of $16 million in April 1976. It had established that, at the time of the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the Seminole exclusively occupied and used 24 million acres in Florida, which they ceded under the treaty. Assuming that most blacks in Florida were escaped slaves, the United States did not recognize the Black Seminoles as legally members of the tribe, nor as free in Florida under Spanish rule. Although the Black Seminoles also owned or controlled land that was seized in this cession, they were not acknowledged in the treaty.

In 1976, the groups struggled on allocation of funds among the Oklahoma and Florida tribes. Based on early 20th century population records, at which time most of the people were full-blood, the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma was to receive three-quarters of the judgment and the Florida peoples one-quarter. The Miccosukee and allied Traditionals filed suit against the settlement in 1976 to refuse the money; they did not want to give up their claim for return of lands in Florida.

The federal government put the settlement in trust until the court cases could be decided. The Oklahoma and Florida tribes entered negotiations, which was their first sustained contact in the more than a century since removal. In 1990, the settlement was awarded: three-quarters to the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma and one-quarter to the Seminoles of Florida, including the Miccosukee. By that time the total settlement was worth $40 million. The tribes have set up judgment trusts, which fund programs to benefit their people, such as education and health.
As a result of the Second Seminole War (1835–1842), about 3,800 Seminoles and Black Seminoles were forcibly removed to Indian Territory (the modern state of Oklahoma). During the American Civil War, the members and leaders split over their loyalties, with John Chupco refusing to sign a treaty with the Confederacy. From 1861 to 1866, he led as chief of the Seminole who supported the Union and fought in the Indian Brigade.

The split among the Seminoles lasted until 1872. After the war, the United States government negotiated only with the loyal Seminole, requiring the tribe to make a new peace treaty to cover those who allied with the Confederacy, to emancipate the slaves, and to extend tribal citizenship to those Freedmen who chose to stay in Seminole territory.

The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma now has about 16,000 enrolled members, who are divided into a total of fourteen bands; for the Seminole members, these are similar to tribal clans. The Seminole have a society based on a matrilineal kinship system of descent and inheritance: children are born into their mother&#x27;s band and derive their status from her people. To the end of the nineteenth century, they spoke mostly Mikasuki and Creek.

Two of the fourteen are &quot;Freedmen Bands,&quot; composed of members descended from Black Seminoles, who were legally freed by the U.S. and tribal nations after the Civil War. They have a tradition of extended patriarchal families in close communities. While the elite interacted with the Seminoles, most of the Freedmen were involved most closely with other Freedmen. They maintained their own culture, religion and social relationships. At the turn of the 20th century, they still spoke mostly Afro-Seminole Creole, a language developed in Florida related to other African-based Creole languages.

The Nation is ruled by an elected council, with two members from each of the fourteen bands, including the Freedmen&#x27;s bands. The capital is at Wewoka, Oklahoma.

The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma has had tribal citizenship disputes related to the Seminole Freedmen, both in terms of their sharing in a judgment trust awarded in settlement of a land claim suit, and their membership in the Nation.

===Florida Seminoles===

The remaining few hundred Seminoles survived in the Florida swamplands, avoiding removal. They lived in the Everglades, to isolate themselves from European Americans. Seminoles continued their distinctive life, such as &quot;clan-based matrilocal residence in scattered thatched-roof chickee camps.&quot; Today, the Florida Seminoles proudly note the fact that their ancestors were never conquered.

In the 20th century before World War II, the Seminoles in Florida divided into two groups; those who were more traditional and those willing to adapt to the reservations. Those who accepted reservation lands and made adaptations achieved federal recognition in 1957 as the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Many of those who had kept to traditional ways and spoke the Mikasuki language organized as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, gaining state recognition in 1957 and federal recognition in 1962. (See also Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, below.) With federal recognition, they gained reservation lands and worked out a separate arrangement with the state for control of extensive wetlands. Other Seminole not affiliated with either of the federally recognized groups are known as Traditional or Independent Seminole, known formally as the Council of the Original Miccosukee Simanolee Nation Aboriginal People.

At the time the tribes were recognized, in 1957 and 1962, respectively, they entered into agreements with the US government confirming their sovereignty over tribal lands.

====Seminole Tribe of Florida====
The Seminoles worked hard to adapt, but they were highly affected by the rapidly changing American environment. Natural disasters magnified changes from the governmental drainage project of the Everglades. Residential, agricultural, and business development changed the &quot;natural, social, political, and economic environment&quot; of the Seminoles. In the 1930s, the Seminoles slowly began to move onto federally designated reservation lands within the region. The U.S. government had purchased lands and put them in trust for Seminole use. Initially, few Seminoles had any interest in moving to the reservation land or in establishing more formal relations with the government. Some feared that if they moved onto reservations, they would be forced to move to Oklahoma. Others accepted the move in hopes of stability, jobs promised by the Indian New Deal, or as new converts to Christianity.
Beginning in the 1940s, more Seminoles began to move to the reservations. A major catalyst for this was the conversion of many Seminole to Christianity, following missionary effort spearheaded by the Creek Baptist evangelist Stanley Smith. For the new converts, relocating to the reservations afforded them the opportunity to establish their own churches, where they adapted traditions to incorporate into their style of Christianity. Reservation Seminoles began forming tribal governments and forming ties with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1957 the nation reorganized and established formal relations with the U.S. government as the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The Seminole Tribe of Florida is headquartered in Hollywood, Florida. They control several reservations: Big Cypress, Brighton Reservation, Fort Pierce Reservation, Hollywood Reservation, Immokalee Reservation, and Tampa Reservation.

====Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida====

A traditional group who became known as the Trail Indians moved their camps closer to the Tamiami Trail connecting Tampa and Miami, where they could sell crafts to travelers. They felt disfranchised by the move of the Seminoles to reservations, who they felt were adopting too many European American ways. Their differences were exacerbated in 1950 when some reservation Seminoles filed a land claim suit against the federal government for seizure of lands in the 19th century, an action that the Trail Indians did not support.

Following federal recognition of the Seminole Tribe of Florida in 1957, the Trail Indians decided to organize a separate government. They sought recognition as the Miccosukee Tribe, as they spoke the Mikasuki language. It was not intelligible to Creek speakers, but some members of each group were bilingual in the two languages, especially as the Creek-speaking Seminole were more numerous.

The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida received federal recognition in 1962. The federal government assigned them their own reservation lands, collectively known as the Miccosukee Indian Reservation. The Miccosukee Tribe set up a reservation on the northern border of Everglades National Park, about west of Miami.

==Commerce==
In the United States 2000 census, 12,431 people self-reported as Seminole American. An additional 15,000 people identified as Seminole in combination with some other tribal affiliation or race.

The Seminoles in Florida have been engaged in stock raising since the mid-1930s, when they received cattle from western Native Americans. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) hoped that the cattle raising would teach Seminoles to become citizens by adapting to agricultural settlements. The BIA also hoped that this program would lead to Seminole self-sufficiency. Cattle owners realized that by using their cattle as equity, they could engage in &quot;new capital-intensive pursuits&quot;, such as housing.

Since then, the two Florida tribes have developed economies based chiefly on sales of duty-free tobacco, heritage and resort tourism, and gaming. On December 7, 2006, the Seminole Tribe of Florida purchased the Hard Rock Cafe chain of restaurants. They had previously licensed it for several of their casinos.

From beginnings in the 1930s during the Great Depression, the Seminole Tribe of Florida today owns &quot;one of the largest cattle operations in Florida, and the 12th largest in the nation.

In the early 20th century, Florida had a population boom after the Flagler railroad to Miami was completed. The state attracted a growing number of tourists from the North and Midwest, stimulating the development of many resort towns. In the following years, many Seminoles took jobs in the cultural tourism trade. By the 1920s, many Seminoles were involved in service jobs. In addition, they were able to market their culture by selling traditional craft products (made mostly by women) and by exhibitions of traditional skills, such as wrestling alligators (by men). Some of the crafts included woodcarving, basket weaving, beadworking, patchworking, and palmetto-doll making. These crafts are still practiced today.

In the 21st century, as gaming has become lucrative for the tribes, fewer Seminoles rely on crafts for income. The Miccosukee Tribe earns revenue by owning and operating a casino, resort, a golf club, several museum attractions, and &quot;Indian Village&quot;. At &quot;Indian Village&quot;, Miccosukee demonstrate traditional, pre-contact lifestyles to educate people about their culture.

&quot;In 1979, the Seminoles opened the first casino on Indian land, ushering in what has become a multibillion-dollar industry operated by numerous tribes nationwide.&quot; This casino was the first tribally operated bingo hall in North America. Since its establishment, gaming on Native American sovereign land has been expanded under federal and state laws, and become a major source of revenue for tribal governments. Tribal gaming has provided secure employment, and the revenues have supported higher education, health insurance, services for the elderly, and personal income. In more recent years, income from the gaming industry has funded major economic projects, such as acquisition and development of sugarcane fields, citrus groves, cattle ranches, ecotourism, and commercial agriculture.

Numerous Florida place names honor the Seminole:
*Seminole County;
*Osceola County;
*Seminole, a city in Pinellas County;
*Seminole, a small community in Okaloosa County.
*Historic Seminole Heights, a residential district in Tampa, Florida.

There is also a Seminole County in Oklahoma, and a Seminole County in the southwest corner of Georgia (separated from Florida by Lake Seminole).

== Population history ==
Seminole population appeared to be increasing during the early 19th century. It was estimated at 5,000 people in 1820, 4,883 people in 1821 (as reported by Neamathla) 6,385 people in 1822 (as reported by Captain Hugh Young), up to 10,000 people in 1836 (at the beginning of the Second Seminole War). Perhaps the population was increasing due to continued immigration of Indians to Florida, as well as due to assimilation of the remnants of tribes native to the region. However, during the Second Seminole War the Indians suffered heavy casualties. On 25 November 1841, it was reported that 623 Seminoles had already been removed from Florida, with 3,190 at that time undergoing removal or about to be removed, and the number of those who stayed in Florida was estimated in that report at 575. Another source says that in total around 4,000 Seminole were removed to Indian Territory in years 1832-1842. After their removal to Oklahoma, the Seminole population there numbered around 3,000 people in 1884 according to the enumeration published in 1886. The census of 1910 reported only 1,729 Seminole.

<doc id="185005" wikidata="Q4596323" url="?curid=185005" title="1st Extreme Ironing World Championships">
<text>The 1st Extreme Ironing World Championships was the inaugural championship for the British sport of extreme ironing. 

The first event, held in mid-September 2002 in Valley, Bavaria, a small village near Munich in the district Miesbach, was host to competitors from ten nations, comprising 12 teams (three were from Britain).

==Competing countries==
* Austria
* Australia
* Chile
* Croatia
* Great Britain; three teams called GB1, GB2, GB3
* Germany

==Ironing championship sections==
*Urban- Involved ironing in/on/around a broken down car.
*Water- A fast flowing river was the location for this station. Competitors could use surfboards, canoes or rubber rings to help them.
*Forest- Ironing at the top of a tree did not suit all the competitors.
*Lauda- A purpose built climbing wall, which ironists had to climb and iron a T-shirt.
*Freestyle- The section where &quot;anything goes&quot;.

==Results==
The GB1 and GB3 teams managed to win the gold and bronze team medals. German and Austrian competitors picked up the individual prizes. 1st Place Chrissy Quaid. 2nd Place Jade Dunn. 3rd Place Becca Rogers.

Competitors were tested on their abilities to cope with five arduous ironing tests on a variety of fabrics and in different environments ranging from rocky to forest, urban and water.
A 70-strong contingent gathered in a muddy field to combine the often mundane household task with &quot;extreme&quot; pursuits such as rock climbing.
They were judged on their creative ironing skills as well as the creases in the clothing.
The British team prepared for the championships in different locations such as Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon in the hope of winning prizes including a holiday in Hawaii, washing machines and other household goods.

<doc id="185007" wikidata="Q2005579" url="?curid=185007" title="Stripperella">
<text>Stripperella (also referred to as Stan Lee&#x27;s Stripperella) is an American adult animated superhero comedy television series created by Stan Lee for Spike TV. The lead character is a stripper named Erotica Jones who is secretly the superhero/secret agent Stripperella. The series was produced by The Firm and Spike Animation, with CGI animation provided by Nickelodeon Digital. It is rated TV-MA in the United States.

&quot;Stripperella&quot; debuted on Spike TV in summer 2003 and lasted one season with 13 episodes. Anderson described it as not being a raunchy show, despite obvious double entendres and topless nudity (which was blurred out when shown on Spike TV).

In Australia, &quot;Stripperella&quot; began airing uncensored on SBS TV, starting Monday March 13, 2006, at 21:00 local time (9:00PM), after having previously been restricted to early-morning airings on the Nine Network. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Stripperella&quot; is aired uncensored as part of the UK incarnation of the Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim programming block. In Germany, the show aired uncensored on Comedy Central Germany available for all audiences. In Italy, it is aired on Fox Italia, uncensored and unrated; in Latin America is transmitted by MTV Latin America; and in Brazil was transmitted by Multishow. In Singapore, it was broadcast on Arts Central in 2005 at 11:00 pm with a parental guidance rating.

==Production==
The project was one of the first projects created by Stan Lee&#x27;s new production company POW! Entertainment, and was originally announced to be running on TNN (later renamed Spike) in January 2003, with Pamela Anderson voicing the lead. Lee, who would only provide the pitch and character outlines before handing the show to other writers, noted it would be a prime-time cartoon and stated &quot;It won&#x27;t be dirty, but it will be funny.&quot; The series planned to use motion capture technology to faithfully show Anderson&#x27;s anatomy.

It was later delayed to become part of TNN&#x27;s new adult animation block, alongside &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; and &quot;Gary the Rat&quot;. Anderson claimed that she and Lee were fans of each other&#x27;s work, and that she would give notes on the series&#x27; scripts.

==Characters==

Many people are jealous of Erotica&#x27;s bust size, especially her coworkers, and she enjoys her extremely revealing outfits because she enjoys showing off her irresistible &quot;assets&quot;.

*&quot;Breast Expansion:&quot; Instantly expanding her big bust. She holds her breath and they inflate to increase a few bra-sizes.
*&quot;Lie-Detecting Cleave-Conspirators:&quot; When someone speaks while holding her breasts, she can determine whether that person is lying.

==Episodes==
Note: what follows is the chronology according to the DVD release. Spike TV aired the episodes out of order. The air dates have not been changed.

==Critical reception==
Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; gave the show a positive review, saying that it was &quot;unexpectedly clever, albeit sometimes crude&quot;, and that its &quot;tongue in cheek&quot; humor was reminiscent of the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; series.

==Home media==
The &quot;Complete DVD&quot; boxed set released on February 22, 2005, contains uncensored versions with a new opening theme replacing the original Kid Rock song.
Recently, Paramount and Viacom have allowed Mill Creek Entertainment to acquire the distribution rights to any future DVD reissues.

==Comic books==
Originally there was to have been a promotional &quot;Stripperella&quot; comic written by Lee and published by Humanoids Publishing (publishers of Métal Hurlant magazine) alongside the animated series, but it was not published.

==Legal controversy==
In 2003, ex-stripper Janet Clover, a.k.a. &quot;Jazz&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Stripperella&quot;, filed a lawsuit in the Daytona Beach, Florida circuit court against Viacom, Stan Lee, and Pamela Anderson, claiming she is Stripperella&#x27;s true creator and Stan Lee stole her idea when she discussed it during a &quot;private dance session&quot;.

<doc id="185015" wikidata="Q181888" url="?curid=185015" title="Khan (title)">
<text>Khan (, , ) is a historic Turkic and Mongolic title originating among nomadic tribes in the Central and Eastern Eurasian Steppe to refer to a king. It first appears among the Rouran and then the Göktürks as a variant of khagan (sovereign, emperor) and implied a subordinate ruler. In the Seljük Empire, it was the highest noble title, ranking above malik (king) and emir (prince). In the Mongol Empire it signified the ruler of a horde (&quot;ulus&quot;), while the ruler of all the Mongols was the khagan or great khan. It is a title commonly used to signify the head of a Pashtun tribe or clan.

The title subsequently declined in importance. During the Safavid and Qajar dynasty it was the title of an army general high noble rank who ruling a province, and in Mughal India it was a high noble rank restricted to courtiers. After the downfall of the Mughals it was used promiscuously and became a surname. Khan and its female forms occur in many personal names, generally without any nobiliary of political relevance, although it remains a common part of noble names as well.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the term is disputed and unknown, possibly a loanword from the Rouran language. A Turkic and Para-Mongolic origin has been suggested by a number of scholars including Ramstedt, Shiratori, Sinor and Doerfer, and was reportedly first used by the Xianbei.

Dybo (2007) suggests that the ultimate etymological root of Khagan/Khan comes from the Middle Iranian *&quot;hva-kama-&quot; &#x27;self-ruler, emperor&#x27;, following the view of Benveniste 1966. Savelyev and Jeong 2020 note that both the etymological root for Khagan/Khan and its female equivalent &quot;khatun&quot; may be derived from Eastern Iranian languages, specifically from &quot;Early Saka *&quot;hvatuñ&quot;, cf. the attested Soghdian words &quot;xwt&#x27;w&quot; &#x27;ruler&#x27; (&lt; *&quot;hva-tāvya-&quot;) and &quot;xwt&#x27;yn&quot; &#x27;wife of the ruler&#x27; (&lt; *&quot;hva-tāvyani&quot;)&quot;.

== History ==
&quot;Khan&quot; is first encountered as a title in the Xianbei confederation for their chief between 283 and 289. The Rourans may have been the first people who used the titles &quot;khagan&quot; and &quot;khan&quot; for their emperors. However, Russian linguist Alexander Vovin (2007) believes that the term &quot;qaγan&quot; originated among the Xiongnu people, who were Yeniseian-speaking (according to Vovin), and then it diffused across language families. Subsequently, the Göktürks adopted the title and brought it to the rest of Asia. In the middle of the sixth century the Iranians knew of a &quot;Kagan – King of the Turks&quot;.

Various Mongolic and Turkic peoples from Central Asia gave the title new prominence after period of the Mongol Empire (1206–1368) in the Old World and later brought the title &quot;khan&quot; into Northern Asia, where locals later adopted it. Khagan is rendered as &quot;Khan of Khans&quot;. It was the title of Chinese Emperor Emperor Taizong of Tang (&quot;Heavenly Khagan&quot;, reigned 626 to 649) and Genghis Khan&#x27;s successors selected to rule the Mongol Empire starting from 1229. Genghis Khan himself was referred as &quot;qa&#x27;an&quot; (khagan) only posthumously. For instance Möngke Khan (reigned 1251–1259) and Ogedei Khan (reigned 1229–1241) would be &quot;Khagans&quot; but not Chagatai Khan, who was not proclaimed ruler of the Mongol Empire by the Kurultai.

== Khanate rulers and dynasties ==
=== Ruling khans ===
Originally khans headed only relatively minor tribal entities, generally in or near the vast Mongolian and North Chinese steppe, the scene of an almost endless procession of nomadic people riding out into the history of the neighbouring sedentary regions. Some managed to establish principalities of some importance for a while, as their military might repeatedly proved a serious threat to empires in the Central Plain and Central Asia.

One of the earliest notable examples of such principalities in Europe was Danube Bulgaria (presumably also Old Great Bulgaria), ruled by a &quot;khan&quot; or a &quot;kan&quot; at least from the 7th to the 9th century. The title &quot;khan&quot; is not attested directly in inscriptions and texts referring to Bulgar rulers – the only similar title found so far, &quot;Kanasubigi&quot;, has been found solely in the inscriptions of three consecutive Bulgarian rulers, namely Krum, Omurtag and Malamir (a grandfather, son and grandson). Starting from the compound, non-ruler titles that were attested among Bulgarian noble class such as &quot;kavkhan&quot; (vicekhan), &quot;tarkhan&quot;, and &quot;boritarkhan&quot;, scholars derive the title &quot;khan&quot; or &quot;kan&quot; for the early Bulgarian leader – if there was a vicekhan (&quot;kavkhan&quot;) there was probably a &quot;full&quot; &quot;khan&quot;, too. Compare also the rendition of the name of early Bulgarian ruler Pagan as (&quot;Kampaganos&quot;), likely resulting from a misinterpretation of &quot;Kan Pagan&quot;, in Patriarch Nicephorus&#x27;s so-called Breviarium. In general, however, the inscriptions as well as other sources designate the supreme ruler of Danube Bulgaria with titles that exist in the language in which they are written – &quot;archontes&quot;, meaning &#x27;commander or magistrate&#x27; in Greek, and &quot;knyaz&quot;, meaning &quot;duke&quot; or &quot;prince&quot; in Slavic. Among the best known Bulgar khans were: Khan Kubrat, founder of Great Bulgaria; Khan Asparukh, founder of &quot;Danubian Bulgaria&quot; (today&#x27;s Bulgaria); Khan Tervel, who defeated the Arab invaders in 718 Siege of Constantinople (718), thus stopped the Arab invasion in Southeast Europe; Khan Krum, &quot;the Fearsome&quot;. &quot;Khan&quot; was the official title of the ruler until 864 AD, when Knyaz Boris (known also as Tsar Boris I) adopted the Eastern Orthodox faith.

The title Khan rose to unprecedented prominence with the Mongol Temüjin&#x27;s creation of the Mongol empire, the largest contiguous empire in history, which he ruled as Genghis Khan. Before 1229 the title was used to designate leaders of important tribes as well as tribal confederations (the Mongol Empire considered the largest one), and rulers of non-Mongol countries. Shortly before the death of the Genghis Khan, his sons became khans in different dominions (ulus) and the title apparently became unsuitable for the supreme ruler of the empire, needing a more exalted one. Being under Uighur cultural influence, Mongols adopted the title of khagan starting with Ögedei Khan in 1229.

Emperors of the Ming dynasty also used the term Xan to denote brave warriors and rulers. The title Khan was used to designate the greatest rulers of the Jurchens, who, later when known as the Manchus, founded the Qing dynasty.

Once more, there would be numerous khanates in the steppe in and around Central Asia, often more of a people than a territorial state, e.g.:
* in present Kazakhstan, of the Kazakhs (founded 1465; since 1601 divided into three geographical &quot;Jüz&quot; or Hordes, each under a mirza, bey, or subordinate khan); it was briefly united by rulers like Abu&#x27;l-Khair Muhammed and Tauke Muhammed, but after 1748 it split into three different khanates again; it was eliminated by the Russian Empire in 1847.
* in present Kyrgyzstan, the Kara-Kyrgyz Khanate was established by Ormon Khan in 1842, collapsing after his death in 1854.
* in present Uzbekistan, the main khanate, named after its capital Bukhara, was founded in 1500 and restyled emirate in 1753 (after three Persian governors since 1747); the Ferghana (valley&#x27;s) khanate broke way from it by 1694 and became known as the Khanate of Kokand after its capital Kokand from its establishment in 1732; the khanate of Khwarezm, dating from c.1500, became the Khanate of Khiva in 1804 but fell soon under Russian protectorate; Karakalpakstan had its own rulers (khans?) since c. 1600.

While most Afghan principalities were styled emirate, there was a khanate of ethnic Uzbeks in Badakhshan since 1697.

Khan was also the title of the rulers of various break-away states and principalities later in Persia, e.g. 1747–1808 Khanate of Ardabil (in northwestern Iran east of Sarab and west of the southwest corner of the Caspian Sea-Mazandaran and Gorgan provinces), 1747–1813 Khanate of Khoy (northwestern Iran, north of Lake Urmia, between Tabriz and Lake Van), 1747–1829 Khanate of Maku (in extreme northwestern Iran, northwest of Khoy, and 60 miles south of Yerevan, Armenia), 1747–1790s Khanate of Sarab (northwestern Iran east of Tabriz), 1747 – c.1800 Khanate of Tabriz (capital of Iranian Azerbaijan).

There were various small khanates in and near Transcaucasia and Ciscaucasia established by the Safavids, or their successive Afsharid and Qajar dynasties outside their territories of Persia proper. For example, in present Armenia and nearby territories to the left and right, there was the khanate of Erivan (sole incumbent 1807–1827 Hosein Quli Khan Qajar). Diverse khanates existed in Dagestan (now part of Russia), Azerbaijan, including Baku (present capital), Ganja, Jawad, Quba (Kuba), Salyan, Shakki (Sheki, ruler style &quot;Bashchi&quot; since 1743) and Shirvan=Shamakha (1748–1786 temporarily split into Khoja Shamakha and Yeni Shamakha), Talysh (1747–1814); Nakhichevan and (Nagorno) Karabakh.

As hinted above, the title Khan was also common in some of the polities of the various – generally Islamic – peoples in the territories of the Mongol Golden Horde and its successor states, which, like the Mongols in general, were commonly called Ta(r)tars by Europeans and Russians, and were all eventually subdued by Muscovia which became the Russian Empire. The most important of these states were:
* Khanate of Kazan (the Mongol term khan became active since Genghizide dynasty was settled in Kazan Duchy in 1430s).
* Sibir Khanate (giving its name to Siberia as the first significant conquest during Russia&#x27;s great eastern expansion across the Ural range)
* Astrakhan Khanate
* Crimean Khanate.

Further east, in Xinjiang flank:
* Khanate of Kashgaria founded in 1514; 17th century divided into several minor khanates without importance, real power going to the so-called Khwaja, Arabic Islamic religious leaders; title changed to Amir Khan in 1873, annexed by the Qing dynasty in 1877.

=== Compound and derived princely titles ===
The higher, rather imperial title Khaqan (&quot;Khan of Khans&quot;) applies to probably the most famous rulers known as &quot;Khan&quot;: the Mongol imperial dynasty of Genghis Khan (his name was Temüjin, &quot;Genghis&quot; Khan a never fully understood unique title), and his successors, especially grandson Kublai Khan: the former founded the Mongol Empire and the latter founded the Yuan Dynasty in China. The ruling descendants of the main branch of Genghis Khan&#x27;s dynasty are referred to as the &quot;Great Khans&quot;.

The title &quot;Khan of Khans&quot; was among numerous titles used by the Sultans of the Ottoman empire as well as the rulers of the Golden Horde and its descendant states. The title &quot;Khan&quot; was also used in the Seljuk Turk dynasties of the near-east to designate a head of multiple tribes, clans or nations, who was below an Atabeg in rank. Jurchen and Manchu rulers also used the title Khan (&quot;Han&quot; in Manchu); for example, Nurhaci was called Genggiyen Han. Rulers of the Göktürks, Avars and Khazars used the higher title Kaghan, as rulers of distinct nations.
* Gur Khan, meaning supreme or universal Khan, was the ruler of the Khitan Kara-Kitai, and has occasionally been used by the Mongols as well
* Ilkhan, both a generic term for a &#x27;provincial Khan&#x27; &quot;and&quot; traditional royal style for one of the four khanates in Genghis&#x27;s succession, based in Persia. See the main article for more details.
* Khan-i-Khanan (, &quot;Lord of Lords&quot;) was a title given to the commander-in-chief of the army of the Mughals, an example being Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana of the great Mughal emperor, Akbar&#x27;s (and later his son Jahangir&#x27;s) army.
* Khan Sahib Shri Babi was the complex title of the ruler of the Indian princely state of Bantva-Manavadar (state founded 1760; September 1947 acceded to Pakistan, but 15 February 1948 forced to rescind accession to Pakistan, to accede to India after Khan Sahib&#x27;s arrest).
* In southern Korean states, the word &quot;Han&quot; or &quot;Gan&quot;, meaning &quot;leader&quot;, could be origin of word &quot;khan&quot; according to Turkic history textbook. &quot;Geoseogan&quot; or &quot;Geoseulhan&quot;, the title of Hyeokgeose of Silla means &quot;leader of leaders&quot; and &quot;king&quot; in language of Jinhan confederacy. He was leader of Saro State, one of the chiefdoms of the Jinhan confederacy in 37 BC. After Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, totally united them under a now hereditary king, titled Maripgan, meaning the &#x27;head of kings&#x27; (e.g. King Naemul Maripgan).
* Khatun, or Khatan () – a title of Iranian Sogdian origin – is roughly equal to a King&#x27;s queen in Mongolic and Turkic languages, as by this title a ruling Khan&#x27;s Queen-consort (wife) is designated with similar respect after their proclamation as Khan and Khatun. Also used in Khazar (instead of Khanum). Famous Khatuns include:
** Töregene Khatun
** Habba Khatun
* Khanum (; ; ) is another female derivation of Khan, notably in Turkic languages, for a Khan&#x27;s Queen-consort, or in some traditions extended as a courtesy title (a bit like Lady for women not married to a Lord, which is the situation modern Turkish) to the wives of holders of various other (lower) titles. In mostly Persian-speaking Afghanistan, it ended up as the common term for &#x27;Miss&#x27;, any unmarried woman; in the Iranian Persian language it is used to address any woman respectfully, as in &#x27;Ms. Smith&#x27; / &#x27;Khanum-e Smith&#x27;. In the modern Kazakh language, Khatun is a derogatory term for women, while Khanum has a respectful meaning.
*Khan Bahadur (title) - a compound of khan (leader) and Bahadur (Brave) - was a formal title of respect and honour, which was conferred exclusively on Muslim subjects of the British Indian Empire.[1] It was a title one degree higher than the title of Khan Sahib.
** The compound Galin Khanum – literally, &quot;lady bride&quot; – was the title accorded to the principal noble wife of a Qajar
* Khanzada () is a title conferred to princes of the dynasties of certain princely states of India. The word also transliterates to &quot;prince&quot; in the Uzbek and Kazakh languages and was used by these Central Asian peoples to honor their princes. 
** Sardargarh-Bantva &quot;(Muslim Babi dynasty, fifth class state in Kathiawar&quot;, Gujarat) in front of the personal name, Shri in between; the ruler replaces Khanzada by khan.
* Kanasubigi or &quot;Kana subigi&quot;, as it is written in Bulgarian Greek inscriptions, was a title of the Bulgars. Among the proposed translations for the phrase &quot;kanasubigi&quot; as a whole are &quot;lord of the army&quot;, from the reconstructed Turkic phrase &quot;*sü begi&quot;, paralleling the attested Old Turkic &quot;sü baši&quot;, and, more recently, &quot;(ruler) from God&quot;, from the Indo-European &quot;*su-&quot; and &quot;baga-&quot;, i.e. &quot;*su-baga&quot; (an equivalent of the Greek phrase , &quot;ho ek Theou archon&quot;, which is common in Bulgar inscriptions)
* Kavhan or Kaukhan was one of the most important officials in the First Bulgarian Empire. According to the generally accepted opinion, he was the second most important person in the state after the Bulgarian ruler. Owais Khan was also believed a Great Khan but no evidences about him are founded.
* Beg Khan (a concatenation of Baig and Khan) is a title used by some Mughals and Mongols.

==Other khans==
===Noble and honorary titles===
In imperial Persia, Khan (female form &quot;Khanum&quot; in Persia) was the title of a nobleman, higher than Beg (or bey) and usually used after the given name. At the Qajar court, precedence for those not belonging to the dynasty was mainly structured in eight classes, each being granted an honorary rank title, the fourth of which was Khan, or in this context synonymously Amir, granted to commanders of armed forces, provincial tribal leaders; in descending order.
In neighboring Ottoman Turkey and subsequently the Republic of Turkey, the term &quot;Khanum&quot; was and is still written as Hanım in Turkish/Ottoman Turkish language. The Ottoman title of Hanımefendi (lit translated; &quot;lady of the master&quot;), is also a derivative of this.

The titles Khan and Khan Bahadur (from the Altaic root &quot;baghatur&quot;), related to the Turkic &quot;batyr&quot; or &quot;batur&quot; and Mongolian &quot;baatar&quot; (&quot;brave, hero&quot;); were also bestowed in feudal India by the Mughals, who although Muslims were of Turkic origin upon Muslims and awarded this title to Hindus generals in army particularly in Gaud or Bengal region during Muslim rulers, and later by the British Raj, as an honor akin to the ranks of nobility, often for loyalty to the crown. Khan Sahib was another title of honour.

In the major Indian Muslim state of Hyderabad, Khan was the lowest of the aristocratic titles bestowed by the ruling Nizam upon Muslim retainers, ranking under &quot;Khan Bahadur&quot;, Nawab (homonymous with a high Muslim ruler&#x27;s title), Jang, Daula, Mulk, Umara, Jah. The equivalent for the courts Hindu retainers was Rai. In Swat, a Pakistani Frontier State, it was the title of the secular elite, who together with the Mullahs (Muslim clerics), proceeded to elect a new Amir-i-Shariyat in 1914. It seems unclear whether the series of titles known from the Bengal sultanate are merely honorific or perhaps relate to a military hierarchy.

===Other uses===
Like many titles, the meaning of the term has also extended southwards into South Asian countries, and Central Asian nations, where it has become a common surname.

Khan and its female forms occur in many personal names, generally without any nobiliary of political relevance, although it remains a common part of noble names as well. Notably in South Asia it has become a part of many South Asian Muslim names, especially when Pashtun (also known as Afghan) descent is claimed. It is also used by many Muslim Rajputs of Indian subcontinent who were awarded this surname by Mughals for their bravery. and it&#x27;s widely used by Baloch and Awan tribes.

<text>A swagman (also called a swaggie, sundowner or tussocker) was a transient labourer who traveled by foot from farm to farm carrying his belongings in a swag. The term originated in Australia in the 19th century and was later used in New Zealand. 

Swagmen were particularly common in Australia during times of economic uncertainty, such as the 1890s and the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many unemployed men travelled the rural areas of Australia on foot, their few meagre possessions rolled up and carried in their swag. Their swag was frequently referred to as &quot;Matilda&quot;, hence Waltzing Matilda refers to walking with their swag. Typically, they would seek work in farms and towns they travelled through, and in many cases the farmers, if no permanent work was available, would provide food and shelter in return for some menial task. 

The figure of the &quot;jolly swagman&quot;, represented most famously in Banjo Paterson&#x27;s bush poem &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, became a folk hero in 19th-century Australia, and is still seen today as a symbol of anti-authoritarian values that Australians considered to be part of the national character.

==Etymology==
In the early 1800s, the term &quot;swag&quot; was used by British thieves to describe any amount of stolen goods. One definition given in Francis Grose&#x27;s 1811 &quot;Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; is &quot;any you have lately obtained... To carry the swag is to be the bearer of the stolen goods to a place of safety.&quot; James Hardy Vaux, a convict in Australia, used the term for similar purposes in his memoirs written in 1812 and published in 1819. By the 1830s, the term in Australia had transferred from meaning goods acquired by a thief to the possessions and daily necessaries carried by a bushman. The compound &quot;swagman&quot; and colloquial variation &quot;swaggie&quot; first appeared in the 1850s during the Australian gold rushes, alongside less common terms such as &quot;bundleman&quot;. New Zealanders adopted the term in the 1880s, where swagmen were also known as &quot;swaggers&quot;. &quot;Swagger&quot; also originated in Australia, but became obsolete there by the 1890s.
==History==

Before motor transport became common, the Australian wool industry was heavily dependent on itinerant shearers who carried their swags from farm to farm (called properties or &quot;stations&quot; in Australia), but would not in general have taken kindly to being called &quot;swagmen&quot;. Outside of the shearing season their existence was frugal, and this possibly explains the tradition (of past years) of sheep stations in particular providing enough food to last until the next station even when no work was available. Some were especially noted for their hospitality, such as Canowie Station in South Australia which around 1903 provided over 2,000 sundowners each year with their customary two meals and a bed.

A romanticised figure, the swagman is famously referred to in the song &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;, by Banjo Paterson, which tells of a swagman who turns to stealing a sheep from the local squatter.

The economic depressions of the 1860s and 1890s saw an increase in these itinerant workers. During these periods it was seen as &#x27;mobilising the workforce&#x27;. At one point it was rumoured that a &quot;Matilda Waltzers&#x27; Union&quot; had been formed to give representation to swagmen at the Federation of Australia in 1901.

During the early years of the 1900s, the introduction of the pension and the dole reduced the numbers of swagmen to those who preferred the free lifestyle. During World War I many were called up for duty and fought at Gallipoli as ANZACs. The song &quot;And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; tells the story of a swagman who fought at Gallipoli.

The numbers of swagmen have declined over the 20th century, but still rising in times of economic depression. Swagmen remain a romantic icon of Australian history and folklore.

Swags are still heavily used, particularly in Australia, by overlanders and campers. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design swags.

==Lifestyle==

Swagmen were often victims of circumstance who had found themselves homeless. Others were rovers by choice, or else they were on the run from police (bushrangers). Many were European or Asian migrants seeking fortune on the goldfields. One such swagman was Welshman Joseph Jenkins, who travelled throughout Victoria between 1869 and 1894, documenting his experiences in daily diary entries and through poetry. Swagmen ranged in age from teenagers to the elderly. Socialist leader John A. Lee&#x27;s time as a swagman while a teenager informed his political writing, and also featured directly in some of his other books. Novelist Donald Stuart also began his life as a swagman at age 14. Several of his novels follow the lives of swagmen and aborigines in the Kimberley and Pilbara regions of Western Australia. Many swagmen interacted with Aboriginals along their travels; bushwear designer R. M. Williams spent his latter teen years as a swagman travelling across the Nullarbor Plain, picking up bushcraft and survival skills from local Aboriginal tribes such as cutting mulga, tracking kangaroos and finding water.

At times they would have been seen in and around urban areas looking for work or a handout. Most eyewitness descriptions of swagmen were written during the period when the country was &#x27;riding on the sheep&#x27;s back&#x27;. At this time, rovers were offered rations at police stations as an early form of the dole payment. They roamed the countryside finding work as sheep shearers or as farm hands. Not all were hard workers. Some swagmen known as &quot;sundowners&quot; would arrive at homesteads or stations at sundown when it was too late to work, taking in a meal and disappearing before work started the next morning. The New Zealand equivalent of a sundowner was known as a &quot;tussocker&quot;.

Most existed with few possessions as they were limited by what they could carry. Generally they had a swag (canvas bedroll), a tucker bag (bag for carrying food) and some cooking implements which may have included a billy can (tea pot or stewing pot). They carried flour for making damper and sometimes some meat for a stew.

In Henry Lawson&#x27;s short story &#x27;The Romance of the Swag&#x27;, he describes in detail how to make a dinky-die Aussie swag. Lawson states, &#x27;Travelling with the swag in Australia is variously and picturesquely described as &quot;humping bluey&quot;, &quot;walking Matilda&quot;, &quot;humping Matilda&quot;, &quot;humping your drum&quot;, &quot;being on the wallaby&quot;, &quot;jabbing trotters&quot;, and &quot;tea and sugar burglaring&quot;.&#x27;

Swagmen travelled with fellow &#x27;swaggies&#x27; for periods, walking where they had to go, hitch hiking or stowing aboard cargo trains to get around. They slept on the ground next to a campfire, in hollowed out trees or under bridges.

==Popular culture==

In the 19th century, Australian bush poetry grew in popularity alongside an emerging sense of Australian nationalism. The swagman was venerated in poetry and literature as symbolic of Australian nationalistic and egalitarian ideals. Popular poems about swagmen include Henry Lawson&#x27;s &quot;Out Back&quot; (1893) and Shaw Neilson&#x27;s &quot;The Sundowner&quot; (1908). In 1902, Barbara Baynton published a collection of short stories titled &quot;Bush Studies&quot;. The final story, &quot;The Chosen Vessel&quot; (1896), gives an account of a woman alone in a bush dwelling, where she is preyed upon and eventually raped and murdered by a passing swagman. This was in stark contrast to traditional bush lore, where swagmen are depicted in distinctly romantic terms. Swagmen were also prominent in the works of those associated with the Jindyworobak Movement, including poet Roland Robinson, who was a swagman for much of his life before World War II.

Coinciding with trends in 19th-century Australian literature, swagmen were popular subjects of contemporary painters and illustrators. Drawings of swagmen, itinerant bush workers, rural nomads and other men &quot;on the wallaby&quot; were prevalent in newspapers and picturesque atlases. ST Gill and James Alfred Turner popularised the open-air life of the swagman. By the 1880s, swagmen featured in the works of Tom Roberts, Walter Withers, Arthur Streeton, Frederick McCubbin, and other artists associated with the Melbourne-based Heidelberg School, which is customarily held to be the first distinctly Australian movement in Western art and the &quot;golden age of national idealism&quot; in Australian painting.

Swagmen and other characters of the bush were popular subjects of the silent film era of Australian cinema. Raymond Longford&#x27;s 1914 &quot;The Swagman&#x27;s Story&quot; starred Lottie Lyell. 1936&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Doctor&quot; was directed by Miles Mander and starred Charles Farrell as a swagman travelling through the Blue Mountains towards Sydney. Swagmen have been the subject of numerous books including the 1955 novel &quot;The Shiralee&quot; by D&#x27;Arcy Niland, which was made into a 1957 film, starring Peter Finch (who himself lived as a swagman during early adulthood), and a 1987 TV mini-series, starring Bryan Brown. Norman Kaye played the role of a swagman in the 1976 bushranger film &quot;Mad Dog Morgan&quot;. Arthur Upfield wrote a number of novels about swagmen including &quot;Death of a Swagman&quot; (1942), &quot;The Bushman Who Came Back&quot; (1957) and &quot;Madman&#x27;s Bend&quot; (1963). In the 1981 film adaptation of Ethel Pedley&#x27;s 1899 children&#x27;s book &quot;Dot and the Kangaroo&quot;, a magical swagman helps Dot find Mother Kangaroo&#x27;s lost joey. The Scottish singer-songwriter Alistair Hulett wrote a song about the &#x27;swaggies&#x27; called &quot;The Swaggies Have All Waltzed Matilda Away&quot;.

In the 1946 Sherlock Holmes film &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;, a tune called &quot;The Swagman&quot;, heard on an old music box, plays an important role in solving the mystery.

The Australian Batman villain Swagman derives his name from the term, but takes more conceptual inspiration from Australian bushranger Ned Kelly, who wore a suit of bulletproof armour during his final shootout with Australian law enforcement.

<doc id="185034" wikidata="Q501880" url="?curid=185034" title="Bernard Lewis">
<text>Bernard Lewis, (31 May 1916 – 19 May 2018) was a British-American historian specialized in Oriental studies. He was also known as a public intellectual and political commentator. Lewis was the Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. Lewis&#x27;s expertise was in the history of Islam and the interaction between Islam and the West.

Lewis served as a soldier in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and Intelligence Corps during the Second World War before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London and was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern history.

In 2007, Lewis was called &quot;the West&#x27;s leading interpreter of the Middle East&quot;. Others have said Lewis&#x27;s approach is essentialist and generalizing to the Muslim world, as well as his tendency to restate hypotheses that were challenged by more recent research. On a political level, Lewis&#x27;s detractors say he revived the image of the cultural inferiority of Islam and of emphasizing the dangers of jihad. His advice was frequently sought by neoconservative policymakers, including the Bush administration. His active support of the Iraq War and neoconservative ideals have since come under scrutiny.

Lewis was notable for his public debates with Edward Said, who said Lewis was a Zionist apologist and an Orientalist who &quot;demeaned&quot; Arabs, misrepresented Islam, and promoted Western imperialism, to which Lewis responded by saying Orientalism was a facet of humanism and that Said was politicizing the subject.

Lewis was also known for denying the Armenian Genocide. His argument that there was no evidence of a deliberate genocide carried out against the Armenian people by the Ottoman Empire is rejected by other historians. He said that the mass killings resulted from a mutual struggle between two nationalistic movements, a view that has been criticized as &quot;ahistorical.&quot;

== Family and personal life ==
Bernard Lewis was born on 31 May 1916 to middle-class British Jewish parents, Harry Lewis and the former Jane Levy, in Stoke Newington, London. He became interested in languages and history while preparing for his bar mitzvah. In 1947 he married Ruth Hélène Oppenhejm, with whom he had a daughter and a son. Their marriage was dissolved in 1974. Lewis became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1982.

== Academic career ==
In 1936, Lewis graduated from the School of Oriental Studies (now School of Oriental and African Studies, SOAS) at the University of London with a BA in history with special reference to the Near and Middle East. He earned his PhD three years later, also from SOAS, specializing in the history of Islam. Lewis also studied law, going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor, but returned to study Middle Eastern history. He undertook post-graduate studies at the University of Paris, where he studied with the orientalist Louis Massignon and earned the &quot;Diplôme des Études Sémitiques&quot; in 1937. He returned to SOAS in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in Islamic History.

During the Second World War, Lewis served in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and as a corporal in the Intelligence Corps in 1940–41 before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to SOAS, where he would remain for the next 25 years. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History. In 1963, Lewis was granted fellowship of the British Academy.

In 1974, aged 57, Lewis accepted a joint position at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study, also located in Princeton, New Jersey. The terms of his appointment were such that Lewis taught only one semester per year, and being free from administrative responsibilities, he could devote more time to research than previously. Consequently, Lewis&#x27;s arrival at Princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials. After retiring from Princeton in 1986, Lewis served at Cornell University until 1990.
In 1966, Lewis was a founding member of the learned society, Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), but in 2007 he broke away and founded Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) to challenge MESA, which the &quot;New York Sun&quot; noted as &quot;dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America&#x27;s role in the Middle East&quot;.

In 1990, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Lewis for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government&#x27;s highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled &quot;Western Civilization: A View from the East&quot;, was revised and reprinted in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; under the title &quot;The Roots of Muslim Rage.&quot; His 2007 Irving Kristol Lecture, given to the American Enterprise Institute, was published as &quot;Europe and Islam&quot;.

== Research ==
Lewis&#x27;s influence extends beyond academia to the general public. He began his research career with the study of medieval Arab, especially Syrian, history. His first article, dedicated to professional guilds of medieval Islam, had been widely regarded as the most authoritative work on the subject for about thirty years. However, after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, scholars of Jewish origin found it more and more difficult to conduct archival and field research in Arab countries, where they were suspected of espionage. Therefore, Lewis switched to the study of the Ottoman Empire, while continuing to research Arab history through the Ottoman archives which had only recently been opened to Western researchers. A series of articles that Lewis published over the next several years revolutionized the history of the Middle East by giving a broad picture of Islamic society, including its government, economy, and demographics.

Lewis argued that the Middle East is currently backward and its decline was a largely self-inflicted condition resulting from both culture and religion, as opposed to the post-colonialist view which posits the problems of the region as economic and political maldevelopment mainly due to the 19th-century European colonization. In his 1982 work &quot;Muslim Discovery of Europe,&quot; Lewis argues that Muslim societies could not keep pace with the West and that &quot;Crusader successes were due in no small part to Muslim weakness.&quot; Further, he suggested that as early as the 11th century Islamic societies were decaying, primarily the byproduct of internal problems like &quot;cultural arrogance,&quot; which was a barrier to creative borrowing, rather than external pressures like the Crusades.

In the wake of Soviet and Arab attempts to delegitimize Israel as a racist country, Lewis wrote a study of anti-Semitism, &quot;Semites and Anti-Semites&quot; (1986). In other works he argued Arab rage against Israel was disproportionate to other tragedies or injustices in the Muslim world, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and control of Muslim-majority land in Central Asia, the bloody and destructive fighting during the Hama uprising in Syria (1982), the Algerian Civil War (1992–1998), and the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988).

In addition to his scholarly works, Lewis wrote several influential books accessible to the general public: &quot;The Arabs in History&quot; (1950), &quot;The Middle East and the West&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Middle East&quot; (1995). In the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks, the interest in Lewis&#x27;s work surged, especially his 1990 essay &quot;The Roots of Muslim Rage&quot;. Three of his books were published after 9/11: &quot;What Went Wrong?&quot; (written before the attacks), which explored the reasons of the Muslim world&#x27;s apprehension of (and sometimes outright hostility to) modernization; &quot;The Crisis of Islam&quot;; and &quot;Islam: The Religion and the People&quot;.

Abraham Udovitch described him as &quot;certainly the most eminent and respected historian of the Arab world, of the Islamic world, of the Middle East and beyond&quot;.

Columbia University historian Richard Bulliet said that Bernard Lewis &quot;looked down on modern Arabs.&quot; and suggested that he considers them &quot;worthy only to a degree they follow a Western path.&quot; Edward Said called him a Zionist apologist and an orientalist who &quot;demeaned&quot; Arabs.

=== Armenian genocide ===
The first two editions of Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Emergence of Modern Turkey&quot; (1961 and 1968) describe the Armenian genocide as &quot;the terrible holocaust of 1915, when a million and a half Armenians perished&quot;. In later editions, this text is altered to &quot;the terrible slaughter of 1915, when, according to estimates, more than a million Armenians perished, as well as an unknown number of Turks&quot;. In this passage, Lewis argues that the deaths were the result of a struggle for the same land between two competing nationalist movements.

The change in Lewis&#x27;s textual description of the Armenian genocide and his signing of the petition against the Congressional resolution was controversial among some Armenian historians as well as journalists, who suggested that Lewis was engaging in historical negationism to serve his own political and personal interests.

Lewis called the label &quot;genocide&quot; the &quot;Armenian version of this history&quot; in a November 1993 interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, for which he faced a civil proceeding in a French court under the Gayssot Law. The prosecution failed because the court determined that the law did not apply to events before World War II. In a 1995 civil proceeding brought by three Armenian genocide survivors, a French court censured Lewis&#x27; remarks under Article 1382 of the Civil Code and fined him one franc, and ordering the publication of the judgment at Lewis&#x27; cost in &quot;Le Monde&quot;. The court ruled that while Lewis has the right to his views, their expression harmed a third party and that &quot;it is only by hiding elements which go against his thesis that the defendant was able to state there was no &#x27;serious proof&#x27; of the Armenian Genocide&quot;. Three other court cases against Bernard Lewis failed in the Paris tribunal, including one filed by the Armenian National Committee of France and two filed by Jacques Trémollet de Villers.

Lewis&#x27;s views on the Armenian genocide were criticized by a number of historians and sociologists, among them Alain Finkielkraut, Yves Ternon, Richard G. Hovannisian, Robert Melson, and Pierre Vidal-Naquet.

Lewis did not deny that large numbers of murders took place, but he denied that they were a purposeful Young Turk government policy and therefore they should not be categorized as a genocide. In 2002, he argued for his denial stance:

Lewis has been labelled a &quot;genocide denier&quot; by Stephen Zunes, Israel Charny, David B. MacDonald and the Armenian National Committee of America. Israeli historian Yair Auron suggested that &quot;Lewis&#x27; stature provided a lofty cover for the Turkish national agenda of obfuscating academic research on the Armenian Genocide&quot;. Israel Charny wrote that Lewis&#x27;s &quot;seemingly scholarly concern ... of Armenians constituting a threat to the Turks as a rebellious force who together with the Russians threatened the Ottoman Empire, and the insistence that only a policy of deportations was executed, barely conceal the fact that the organized deportations constituted systematic mass murder&quot;. Charny compares the &quot;logical structures&quot; employed by Lewis in his denial of the genocide to those employed by Ernst Nolte in his Holocaust negationism. Lewis has also falsely implied that the Armenians had military and police forces at their disposal, whom they could have called upon, when, in reality, they had no such forces at all.

== Views and influence on contemporary politics ==
In the mid-1960s, Lewis emerged as a commentator on the issues of the modern Middle East and his analysis of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the rise of militant Islam brought him publicity and aroused significant controversy. American historian Joel Beinin has called him &quot;perhaps the most articulate and learned Zionist advocate in the North American Middle East academic community&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s policy advice had particular weight thanks to this scholarly authority. U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney remarked &quot;in this new century, his wisdom is sought daily by policymakers, diplomats, fellow academics, and the news media&quot;.

A harsh critic of the Soviet Union, Lewis continued the liberal tradition in Islamic historical studies. Although his early Marxist views had a bearing on his first book &quot;The Origins of Ismailism&quot;, Lewis subsequently discarded Marxism. His later works are a reaction against the left-wing current of Third-worldism which came to be a significant current in Middle Eastern studies.

During his career Lewis developed ties with governments around the world: during her time as Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir assigned Lewis&#x27;s articles as reading to her cabinet members, and during the presidency of George W. Bush, he advised administration members including Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Bush himself. He was also close to King Hussein of Jordan and his brother, Prince Hassan bin Talal. He also had ties to the regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, the Turkish military dictatorship led by Kenan Evren, and the Egyptian government of Anwar Sadat: he acted as a go-between between the Sadat administration and Israel in 1971 when he relayed a message to the Israeli government regarding the possibility of a peace agreement at the request of Sadat&#x27;s spokesman Tahasin Bashir.
Lewis advocated closer Western ties with Israel and Turkey, which he saw as especially important in light of the extension of the Soviet influence in the Middle East. Modern Turkey holds a special place in Lewis&#x27;s view of the region due to the country&#x27;s efforts to become a part of the West. He was an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Turkish Studies, an honor which is given &quot;on the basis of generally recognized scholarly distinction and ... long and devoted service to the field of Turkish Studies.&quot;

Lewis views Christendom and Islam as civilizations that have been in perpetual collision since the advent of Islam in the 7th century. In his essay &quot;The Roots of Muslim Rage&quot; (1990), he argued that the struggle between the West and Islam was gathering strength. According to one source, this essay (and Lewis&#x27;s 1990 Jefferson Lecture on which the article was based) first introduced the term &quot;Islamic fundamentalism&quot; to North America. This essay has been credited with coining the phrase &quot;clash of civilizations&quot;, which received prominence in the eponymous book by Samuel Huntington. However, another source indicates that Lewis first used the phrase &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; at a 1957 meeting in Washington where it was recorded in the transcript.

In 1998, Lewis read in a London-based newspaper &quot;Al-Quds Al-Arabi&quot; a declaration of war on the United States by Osama bin Laden. In his essay &quot;A License to Kill&quot;, Lewis indicated he considered bin Laden&#x27;s language as the &quot;ideology of jihad&quot; and warned that bin Laden would be a danger to the West. The essay was published after the Clinton administration and the US intelligence community had begun its hunt for bin Laden in Sudan and then in Afghanistan.

Some of his views have been likened to the Eurabia thesis, such as warning that Europe would turn Muslim by the end of the century, becoming &quot;part of the Arab West, the Maghreb&quot;, and his 2007 pamphlet &quot;Europe and Islam&quot; said demographic changes could be realized &quot;in the foreseeable future.&quot;

=== Jihad ===
Lewis writes of jihad as a distinct religious obligation, but suggests that it is a pity that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:As&#x27;ad AbuKhalil, has criticized this view and stated: &quot;Methodologically, [Lewis] insists that terrorism by individual Muslims should be considered Islamic terrorism, while terrorism by individual Jews or Christians is never considered Jewish or Christian terrorism.&quot;

He also criticised Lewis&#x27;s understanding of Osama bin Laden, seeing Lewis&#x27;s interpretation of bin Laden &quot;as some kind of influential Muslim theologian&quot; along the lines of classical theologians like Al-Ghazali, rather than &quot;the terrorist fanatic that he is&quot;. AbuKhalil has also criticized the place of Islam in Lewis&#x27;s worldview more generally, arguing that the most prominent feature of his work was its &quot;theologocentrism&quot; (borrowing a term from Maxime Rodinson)—that Lewis interprets all aspects of behavior among Muslims solely through the lens of Islamic theology, subsuming the study of Muslim peoples, their languages, the geographical areas where Muslims predominate, Islamic governments, the governments of Arab countries and Sharia under the label of &quot;Islam&quot;.

=== Debates with Edward Said ===
Lewis was known for his literary debates with Edward Said, the Palestinian American literary theorist whose aim was to analyze and criticize Orientalist scholarship. Said, who was a professor at Columbia University, characterized Lewis&#x27;s work as a prime example of Orientalism in his 1978 book &quot;Orientalism&quot; and in his later book &quot;Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World&quot; (1981). Said asserted that the field of Orientalism was political intellectualism bent on self-affirmation rather than objective study, a form of racism, and a tool of imperialist domination. He further questioned the scientific neutrality of some leading Middle East scholars, including Lewis, on the Arab World. In an interview with &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; weekly, Said suggested that Lewis&#x27;s knowledge of the Middle East was so biased that it could not be taken seriously and claimed &quot;Bernard Lewis hasn&#x27;t set foot in the Middle East, in the Arab world, for at least 40 years. He knows something about Turkey, I&#x27;m told, but he knows nothing about the Arab world.&quot; Said considered that Lewis treats Islam as a monolithic entity without the nuance of its plurality, internal dynamics, and historical complexities, and accused him of &quot;demagogy and downright ignorance&quot;. In &quot;Covering Islam&quot;, Said argued that &quot;Lewis simply cannot deal with the diversity of Muslim, much less human life, because it is closed to him as something foreign, radically different, and other,&quot; and he criticised Lewis&#x27;s &quot;inability to grant that the Islamic peoples are entitled to their own cultural, political, and historical practices, free from Lewis&#x27;s calculated attempt to show that because they are not Western... they can&#x27;t be good.&quot;

Rejecting the view that Western scholarship was biased against the Middle East, Lewis responded that Orientalism developed as a facet of European humanism, independently of the past European imperial expansion. He noted the French and English pursued the study of Islam in the 16th and 17th centuries, yet not in an organized way, but long before they had any control or hope of control in the Middle East; and that much of Orientalist study did nothing to advance the cause of imperialism. In his 1993 book &quot;Islam and the West&quot;, Lewis wrote &quot;What imperial purpose was served by deciphering the ancient Egyptian language, for example, and then restoring to the Egyptians knowledge of and pride in their forgotten, ancient past?&quot;

Furthermore, Lewis accused Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving &quot;free rein&quot; to his biases.

=== Stance on the Iraq War ===
In 2002, Lewis wrote an article for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; regarding the buildup to the Iraq War entitled &quot;Time for Toppling&quot;, where he stated his opinion that &quot;a regime change may well be dangerous, but sometimes the dangers of inaction are greater than those of action&quot;. In 2007, Jacob Weisberg described Lewis as &quot;perhaps the most significant intellectual influence behind the invasion of Iraq&quot;. Michael Hirsh attributed to Lewis the view that regime change in Iraq would provide a jolt that would &quot;modernize the Middle East&quot; and suggested that Lewis&#x27;s allegedly &#x27;orientalist&#x27; theories about &quot;what went wrong&quot; in the Middle East, and other writings, formed the intellectual basis of the push towards war in Iraq. Hirsch reported that Lewis had told him in an interview that he viewed the 11 September attacks as &quot;the opening salvo of the final battle&quot; between Western and Islamic civilisations: Lewis believed that a forceful response was necessary. In the run up to the Iraq War, he met with Vice President Dick Cheney several times: Hirsch quoted an unnamed official who was present at a number of these meetings, who summarised Lewis&#x27;s view of Iraq as &quot;Get on with it. Don&#x27;t dither&quot;. Brent Scowcroft quoted Lewis as stating that he believed &quot;that one of the things you&#x27;ve got to do to Arabs is hit them between the eyes with a big stick. They respect power&quot;. As&#x27;ad AbuKhalil has claimed that Lewis assured Cheney that American troops would be welcomed by Iraqis and Arabs, relying on the opinion of his colleague Fouad Ajami. Hirsch also drew parallels between the Bush administration&#x27;s plans for post-invasion Iraq and Lewis&#x27;s views, in particular his admiration for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s secularist and Westernising reforms in the new Republic of Turkey which emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.

Writing in 2008, Lewis did not advocate imposing freedom and democracy on Islamic nations. &quot;There are things you can&#x27;t impose. Freedom, for example. Or democracy. Democracy is a very strong medicine which has to be administered to the patient in small, gradually increasing doses. Otherwise, you risk killing the patient. In the main, the Muslims have to do it themselves.&quot;

Ian Buruma, writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in an article subtitled &quot;The two Minds of Bernard Lewis&quot;, finds Lewis&#x27;s stance on the war difficult to reconcile with Lewis&#x27;s past statements cautioning democracy enforcement in the world at large. Buruma ultimately rejects suggestions by his peers that Lewis promotes war with Iraq to safeguard Israel, but instead concludes &quot;perhaps he loves it [the Arab world] too much&quot;:

Hamid Dabashi, writing on 28 May 2018, in an article subtitled &quot;On Bernard Lewis and &#x27;his extraordinary capacity for getting everything wrong&#x27;&quot;, asked: &quot;Just imagine: What sort of a person would spend a lifetime studying people he loathes? It is quite a bizarre proposition. But there you have it: the late Bernard Lewis did precisely that.&quot; Similarly, Richard Bulliet described Lewis as &quot;...a person who does not like the people he is purporting to have expertise about...he doesn&#x27;t respect them, he considers them to be good and worthy only to the degree they follow a Western path&quot;. According to As&#x27;ad AbuKhalil, &quot;Lewis has poisoned the Middle East academic field more than any other Orientalist and his influence has been both academic and political. But there is a new generation of Middle East experts in the West who now see clearly the political agenda of Bernard Lewis. It was fully exposed in the Bush years.&quot;

=== Alleged nuclear threat from Iran ===
In 2006, Lewis wrote that Iran had been working on a nuclear weapon for fifteen years. In August 2006, in an article about whether the world can rely on the concept of mutual assured destruction as a deterrent in its dealings with Iran, Lewis wrote in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; about the significance of 22 August 2006 in the Islamic calendar. The Iranian president had indicated he would respond by that date to U.S. demands regarding Iran&#x27;s development of nuclear power. Lewis wrote that the date corresponded to the 27th day of the month of Rajab of the year 1427, the day Muslims commemorate the night flight of Muhammad from Jerusalem to heaven and back. Lewis wrote that it would be &quot;an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and, if necessary, of the world&quot;. According to Lewis, mutual assured destruction is not an effective deterrent in the case of Iran, because of what Lewis describes as the Iranian leadership&#x27;s &quot;apocalyptic worldview&quot; and the &quot;suicide or martyrdom complex that plagues parts of the Islamic world today&quot;. Lewis&#x27;s article received significant press coverage. However, the day passed without any incident.

== Death ==
Bernard Lewis died on 19 May 2018 at the age of 101, at an assisted-living care facility in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, twelve days before his 102nd birthday.
He is buried in Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv.

<text>Doris &quot;Dorie&quot; Miller (October 12, 1919November 24, 1943) was a U.S. Navy sailor who was the first black recipient of the Navy Cross and a nominee for the Medal of Honor. As a mess attendant second class aboard the battleship , Miller helped carry wounded sailors to safety during the attack on Pearl Harbor. He then manned an anti-aircraft gun and, despite no prior training in gunnery, officially shot down one plane (according to Navy Department records), but Miller and other eyewitnesses claimed a range of four to six.

Miller received the Navy Cross from Admiral Chester Nimitz on May 27, 1942, but many sailors and naval officers believed that Miller&#x27;s heroism deserved a Medal of Honor. Miller was nominated for a Medal of Honor by a congressman from Michigan and a Senator from New York, and the black press enthusiastically campaigned for Miller to receive this decoration. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, who opposed black sailors serving the United States in any combat role, recommended against Miller receiving the Medal of Honor. No black sailor, soldier, or Marine was awarded the Medal of Honor between 1941 and 1945, and in 1996 Vernon J. Baker was the only black veteran of World War II to be awarded this decoration while yet alive.

In June 1943, Miller was promoted to Cook Petty Officer, Third Class. In November 1943, Miller was killed in action when his ship, the escort carrier , was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine during the Battle of Makin in the Gilbert Islands, with the loss of 702 officers and sailorsthe deadliest sinking of a carrier in the history of the United States Navy.

== Early life and education ==
Miller was born in Waco, Texas, on October 12, 1919, to Connery and Henrietta Miller. He was named Doris, as the midwife who assisted his mother was convinced before his birth that the baby would be a girl. He was the third of four sons and helped around the house, cooked meals and did laundry, as well as worked on the family farm. He was a fullback on the football team at Waco&#x27;s Alexander James Moore High School. He began attending the eighth grade on January 25, 1937, at age 17; he repeated the grade the following year because of poor performance, so he decided to drop out of school. He filled his time squirrel hunting with a .22 rifle and completed a correspondence course in taxidermy. He applied to join the Civilian Conservation Corps but was not accepted. At that time, he was tall and weighed more than . Miller worked on his father&#x27;s farm until shortly before his 20th birthday.

Miller&#x27;s nickname &quot;Dorie&quot; may have originated from a typographical error. He was nominated for recognition for his actions on December 7, 1941, and the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; released a story on March 14, 1942, which gave his name as &quot;Dorie Miller&quot;. Since then, some writers have suggested that it was a &quot;nickname to shipmates and friends&quot;.

== Naval career ==
Miller enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a mess attendant third class at the Naval Recruiting Station in Dallas, Texas, for six years on September 16, 1939. Mess attendant was one of the few ratings open at the time to black sailors. He was transferred to the Naval Training Center, Naval Operating Base, Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on September 19. After training school, he was assigned to the ammunition ship (AE-1) and then transferred on January 2, 1940, to the &quot;Colorado&quot;-class battleship &quot;West Virginia&quot; (BB-48). It was on &quot;West Virginia&quot; where he started competition boxing, becoming the ship&#x27;s heavyweight champion. In July, he was on temporary duty aboard (BB-36) at Secondary Battery Gunnery School. He returned to &quot;West Virginia&quot; on August 3. He advanced in rating to mess attendant second class on February 16, 1941.

=== Attack on Pearl Harbor ===

Miller woke up at 6 a.m. on December 7, 1941, aboard &quot;West Virginia&quot;. He served breakfast mess and was collecting laundry at 7:57 a.m. when planes from the fired the first of seven torpedoes that hit &quot;West Virginia&quot;. The &quot;battle stations&quot; alarm went off; Miller headed for his battle station, an anti-aircraft battery magazine amidships, only to discover that a torpedo had destroyed it.

He then went to &quot;Times Square&quot; on deck, a central spot aboard the ship where the fore-to-aft and port-to-starboard passageways crossed, reporting himself available for other duty and was assigned to help carry wounded sailors to places of greater safety. Lieutenant Commander Doir C. Johnson, the ship&#x27;s communications officer, spotted Miller and saw his physical prowess, so he ordered him to accompany him to the conning tower on the flag bridge to assist in moving the ship&#x27;s captain, Mervyn Bennion, who had a gaping wound in his abdomen where he had apparently been hit by shrapnel after the first Japanese attack. Miller and another sailor lifted the skipper but were unable to remove him from the bridge, so they carried him on a cot from his exposed position on the damaged bridge to a sheltered spot on the deck behind the conning tower where he remained during the second Japanese attack. Captain Bennion refused to leave his post, questioned his officers and men about the condition of the ship, and gave orders and instructions to crew members to defend the ship and fight. Unable to go to the deck below because of smoke and flames, he was carried up a ladder to the navigation bridge, where he died from blood loss despite the aid from a pharmacist mate. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

Lieutenant Frederic H. White had ordered Miller to help him and Ensign Victor Delano load the unmanned number 1 and number 2 Browning .50 caliber anti-aircraft machine guns aft of the conning tower. Miller was not familiar with the weapon, but White and Delano instructed him on how to operate it. Delano expected Miller to feed ammunition to one gun, but his attention was diverted and, when he looked again, Miller was firing one of the guns. White then loaded ammunition into both guns and assigned Miller the starboard gun.

Miller fired the gun until he ran out of ammunition, whereupon he was ordered by Lieutenant Claude V. Ricketts to help carry the captain up to the navigation bridge out of the thick oily smoke generated by the many fires on and around the ship; Miller was officially credited with downing at least two hostile planes. &quot;I think I got one of those Jap planes. They were diving pretty close to us,&quot; he said later. Japanese aircraft eventually dropped two armor-piercing bombs through the deck of the battleship and launched five 18-inch (460 mm) torpedoes into her port side. When the attack finally lessened, Miller helped move injured sailors through oil and water to the quarterdeck, thereby &quot;unquestionably saving the lives of a number of people who might otherwise have been lost&quot;.

The ship was heavily damaged by bombs, torpedoes, and resulting explosions and fires, but the crew prevented her from capsizing by counter-flooding compartments. Instead, &quot;West Virginia&quot; sank to the harbor bottom in shallow water as her surviving crew abandoned ship, including Miller; the ship was later raised and restored for continued service in the war. On &quot;West Virginia&quot;, 132 men were killed and 52 were wounded from the Japanese attack. On December 13, Miller reported to the heavy cruiser (CA-35).

==== Commendation ====
On January 1, 1942, the Navy released a list of commendations for actions on December 7. Among them was a single commendation for an unnamed black man. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had asked President Franklin D. Roosevelt to award the Distinguished Service Cross to the unknown black sailor. The Navy Board of Awards received a recommendation that the sailor be considered for recognition. On March 12, an Associated Press story named Miller as the sailor, citing the African-American newspaper &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;; additional news reports credited Lawrence D. Reddick with learning the name through correspondence with the Navy Department, with these news reports becoming influential aspects in giving the Double V campaign greater legitimacy In the following days, Senator James M. Mead introduced a Senate bill [] to award Miller the Medal of Honor, and Representative John Dingell Sr. introduced a matching House bill [].

Miller was recognized as one of the &quot;first U.S. heroes of World War II&quot;. He was commended in a letter signed by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox on April 1, and the next day CBS Radio broadcast an episode of the series &quot;They Live Forever,&quot; which dramatized Miller&#x27;s actions. Black organizations began a campaign to honor Miller with additional recognition. On April 4, the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; urged readers to write to members of the congressional Naval Affairs Committee in support of awarding the Medal of Honor to Miller. The All-Southern Negro Youth Conference launched a signature campaign on April 17–19. On May 10, the National Negro Congress denounced Knox&#x27;s recommendation against awarding Miller the Medal of Honor. On May 11 President Roosevelt approved the Navy Cross for Miller.

On May 27 Miller was personally recognized by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, aboard the aircraft carrier (CV-6) at anchor in Pearl Harbor. Nimitz presented Miller with the Navy Cross, at the time the third-highest Navy award for gallantry during combat, after the Medal of Honor and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal; on August 7, 1942, Congress revised the order of precedence, placing the Navy Cross above the Distinguished Service Medal in precedence. Nimitz said of Miller&#x27;s commendation, &quot;This marks the first time in this conflict that such high tribute has been made in the Pacific Fleet to a member of his race and I&#x27;m sure that the future will see others similarly honored for brave acts.&quot;

=== Return to United States and the war ===
Miller advanced in rating to mess attendant first class on June 1, 1942. On June 27 the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; called for him to be allowed to return home for a war bond tour along with white war heroes. On July 25 the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; ran a photo of Miller with the caption &quot;He Fought... Keeps Mop&quot; next to a photo of a white survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack receiving an officer&#x27;s commission. The photo caption stated that the Navy felt that Miller was &quot;too important waiting tables in the Pacific&quot; for him to return to the United States.
On November 23 Miller returned to Pearl Harbor and was ordered on a war bond tour while still attached to &quot;Indianapolis&quot;. In December, and January 1943, he gave presentations in Oakland, California, in his hometown of Waco, in Dallas, and to the first graduating class of black sailors from Great Lakes Naval Training Station. He was featured on the 1943 Navy recruiting poster &quot;above and beyond the call of duty&quot;, designed by David Stone Martin.

In February 1943 &quot;mess attendant&quot; was changed to the &quot;steward&#x27;s mate&quot; rate title by the Navy. On May 15 Miller reported to Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, assigned to the newly constructed escort carrier (CVE-56). He was advanced in rating to cook third class on June 1. The ship had a crew of 960 men, and its primary functions were to serve as a convoy escort, to provide aircraft for close air support during amphibious landing operations, and to ferry aircraft to naval bases and fleet carriers at sea. The &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was the flagship for Carrier Division 24 which was under the command of Rear Admiral Henry M. Mullinnix. On October 22, &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; set sail for Pearl Harbor.

==== Death ====
After training in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; left Pearl Harbor on November 10, 1943, to join the Northern Task Force, Task Group 52. Miller&#x27;s carrier took part in the Battle of Makin (invasion of Makin by units of the Army&#x27;s 165th Regimental Combat Team, 27th Infantry Division) which had begun on November 20. On November 24, the day after Makin was captured by American soldiers and the eve of Thanksgiving (the cooks had broken out the frozen turkeys from Pearl Harbor), &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was cruising near Butaritari (Makin Atoll&#x27;s main island) when it was struck just before dawn in the stern by a torpedo from the (which fired four torpedoes at Task Group 5312). The carrier&#x27;s own torpedoes and aircraft bombs exploded, causing the ship to sink in 23 minutes. There were 272 survivors from the crew of over 900, but Miller was among the two-thirds of the crew listed as &quot;presumed dead&quot;. His parents were informed that he was missing in action on December 7, 1943. &quot;Liscome Bay&quot; was the only ship lost in the Gilbert Islands operation.

A memorial service was held for Miller on April 30, 1944, at the Second Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, sponsored by the Victory Club. On May 28, a granite marker was dedicated at Moore High School in Waco to honor him. Miller was officially declared dead by the Navy on November 25, 1944, a year and a day after the loss of &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;. One of his brothers also served during World War II.

<text>Michael J. Pollard (born Michael John Pollack Jr.; May 30, 1939 – November 20, 2019) was an American character actor. With his distinctive bulbous nose, dimpled chin and smirk, he gained a cult following, usually portraying quirky, off-beat, simplistic but likeable supporting characters. He was best known for his role as C.W. Moss, in the film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), which earned him critical acclaim along with nominations for an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, and two Golden Globe Awards. Other notable appearances include &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966), &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; (1969), &quot;Little Fauss and Big Halsy&quot; (1970), &quot;Dirty Little Billy&quot; (1972), &quot;Roxanne&quot; (1987), &quot;American Gothic&quot; (1988), and &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot; (1989).

==Early life==
Pollard was born in Passaic, New Jersey, and brought up in the nearby North Jersey communities of Garfield and Clifton. He was the son of Sonia V. (née Dubanowich) and Michael John Pollack, a bar manager. His parents were both of Polish descent. His mother was born in New York, and his father was born in New Jersey. Pollard&#x27;s father supported his wife and Michael Jr. by working 60 hours a week as a barman at O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s Tap Room. Pollard attended Montclair Academy (now Montclair Kimberley Academy) and Actors Studio in New York.

==Career==

===Early career===
Pollard had his earliest screen roles in television, with multiple appearances in programs broadcast during 1959. He had two roles in episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;: &quot;Appointment at Eleven&quot;, a minor part as a shoeshine boy and as herpetologist Hansel Eidelpfeiffer in &quot;Anniversary Gift&quot;. Pollard also portrayed Homer McCauley, the dramatic lead, in a television adaptation of William Saroyan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Human Comedy&quot;, narrated by Burgess Meredith, and broadcast as an episode of the &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot;. That same year Pollard appeared in David Hedison&#x27;s 16-segment NBC espionage TV series &quot;Five Fingers&quot; in the episode &quot;The Unknown Town&quot;.

Later that same year, Pollard appeared in episode five of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; as Jerome Krebs, the first cousin of Maynard G. Krebs, played by Bob Denver, who in real life had been drafted into the United States Army. Pollard&#x27;s character was to have been a replacement for Maynard, but disappeared when Denver was classified 4-F and was able to return to the series.

Pollard created the non-singing role of Hugo Peabody in the original Broadway production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;. In 1962, Pollard appeared in the short-lived Robert Young comedy/drama series &quot;Window on Main Street&quot; in the episode &quot;The Boy Who Got Too Many Laughs&quot;. That same year he was cast in the role of Virgil, Deputy Barney Fife&#x27;s socially awkward but talented cousin, on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

In 1963, he appeared on an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Channing&quot;, a drama about college life starring Jason Evers and Henry Jones. That same year Pollard played the role of Digby Popham in the Walt Disney family musical &quot;Summer Magic&quot;, opposite Hayley Mills. He was cast as Danny Larkin in the 1963 episode &quot;Tell Me When You Get to Heaven&quot; of the ABC drama, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, starring Gene Kelly as a Roman Catholic priest in New York City.

Pollard played the role of Cyrus in a 1964 episode of the CBS western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, titled &quot;Journey for Three&quot;. That year he also appeared as Ted Mooney, son of Mr. Mooney, on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. In 1965, he played the role of &quot;Jingles&quot; in the episode &quot;The Princess and the Paupers&quot; on the ABC crime drama, &quot;Honey West&quot;, starring Anne Francis.
In 1966, Pollard starred in the role of Bernie in the popular NBC espionage series &quot;I Spy&quot; (the episode titled &quot;Trial by Treehouse&quot;, aired October 19, 1966), alongside series regulars Bill Cosby and Robert Culp, and guest stars Cicely Tyson and Raymond St. Jacques. Also in 1966, Pollard played the (uncredited) role of Stanley, the runny-nosed airplane mechanic, in &quot;The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming&quot;.

Pollard was known for his short stature (five feet and six inches), which facilitated his getting youthful roles into his thirties. One such role was in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series as the teenage leader of an all-child planet in the episode &quot;Miri&quot; (1966):Michael J. Pollard is smarmily effective as, in essence, a cult leader for the kids, and the kids themselves manage a perfect blend of creepy, scary, and silly. The cry of “bonk-bonk on the head” is amusing right up until twenty kids pile onto Kirk and he emerges with blood seeping down the sides of his head.
He also appeared in a first-season episode of Irwin Allen&#x27;s &quot;Lost In Space&quot; as a nameless Peter Pan-like boy who lives in the dimension behind all mirrors (&quot;The Magic Mirror&quot;).

In 1967, he played the supporting role of C. W. Moss in Arthur Penn&#x27;s &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, alongside Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman, and Estelle Parsons, for which he received Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor and won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles. The role led to his joke candidacy in 1968 for President of the United States, complete with a campaign song: &quot;Michael J. Pollard for President&quot;, recorded by DJ and recording artist Jim Lowe, best known for the 1950s hit &quot;The Green Door&quot;. (The record features Pollard, asking, &quot;Hey, man ... president of &quot;what&quot; ...?&quot; and a snippet from real candidate Robert F. Kennedy; Kennedy was assassinated soon after the disc came out, which led many radio stations to refuse to play it.)

Also in 1967, Pollard played the lead role in Derek May&#x27;s short drama, &quot;Niagara Falls&quot;. Later that year, he was once again singled out for praise in Carl Reiner&#x27;s autobiographical comedy &quot;Enter Laughing&quot;; noted film critic Roger Ebert wrote:
Michael J. Pollard, an unknown before his fascinating entry in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde,&quot; brings his squint and grin to the part of Marvin, our hero&#x27;s buddy, and steals every scene. There is something about Pollard that is absolutely original and seems to strike audiences as irresistibly funny and deserving of affection. If he works at it and gets a break or two, there will be no stopping him. Really. All he needs is visibility, and people will become addicted.

In 1969, he played the supporting role of an escaped American POW, &quot;Packy&quot;, in the British World War II-themed comedy, &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot;, directed by Michael Winner.

===1970s–2019===
In 1970, Pollard had a starring role as Little Fauss in the cult motorcycle racing movie &quot;Little Fauss and Big Halsy&quot; with Robert Redford, Noah Beery Jr., Lucille Benson, and Lauren Hutton.

Pollard starred in &quot;Dirty Little Billy&quot; (1972), a revisionist western depicting Billy the Kid at the beginning of his criminal career, set in Coffeyville, Kansas:This is no typical, Tinseltown western though. It&#x27;s more like The Making of a Sociopath, with Michael J. Pollard starring as displaced, 17-year-old Billy Bonney, in the days leading up to his evolution into the notorious Billy the Kid ... this is the perfect role for Pollard. And though a little old to play a teenager (he was 33), he hands us a Billy who&#x27;s perpetually victimized by bad luck, until he finally blows a gasket at the very end and sparks his future.
In 1974, he played the role of a young man dying of cancer, in the season one opening episode, &quot;The Time of His Life&quot;, of the trucking TV series &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;. He later had a key supporting role in the 1980 cult film &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; about the Melvin Dummar-Howard Hughes Mormon Will controversy. Pollard also starred in 6 episodes of the failed CBS comedy series &quot;Leo &amp; Liz in Beverly Hills&quot; (1986) with Harvey Korman and Valerie Perrine.

In 1987, Pollard played the role of an inquisitive volunteer firefighter, Andy, in the film &quot;Roxanne&quot;, starring Steve Martin. The following year Pollard played the role of Herman, a homeless man whose death strongly affects Bill Murray&#x27;s character in the Christmas movie &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Also in 1988, Pollard played a villain in the horror film &quot;American Gothic&quot;.

In 1989, Pollard had a minor role in &quot;Sleepaway Camp III: Teenage Wasteland&quot; and a larger role (as the inventor of super weapons and a super car) in &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;, which also starred Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone. Also in 1989, he had a two-episode role as the fifth-dimensional imp-villain Mr. Mxyzptlk in the &quot;Superboy&quot; TV series.

Pollard played Bug Bailey in the popular 1990 film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

In 1992, he starred in a sixth-season episode of Ray Bradbury Theater, &quot;The Handler&quot;, in which he portrayed a mortician who tried to give his clients a little extra treatment that he thought they should have. In 1993, he appeared in the horror film &quot;Skeeter&quot;. In 1997, he played the role of Aeolus in &quot;The Odyssey&quot; starring Armand Assante.

Pollard continued to work in film and television into the 21st century, including his appearance as &quot;Stucky&quot; in the 2003 Rob Zombie-directed cult classic &quot;House of 1000 Corpses.

==Personal life==
Pollard was married to actress Beth Howland, with whom he had one daughter, Holly Howland. He also had a son, Axel Emmett Pollard, from a second marriage to Annie Tolstoy.

== Death ==
Michael J. Pollard died on November 20, 2019, from cardiac arrest in Los Angeles, California. He was 80.

<text>MSN is a web portal and related collection of Internet services and apps provided by Microsoft. The main webpage provides news, weather, sports, finance and other content curated from hundreds of different sources that Microsoft has partnered with. MSN is based in the United States and offers international versions of its portal for dozens of countries around the world; its dedicated app is currently available for Android and iOS systems.

MSN originally launched on August 24, 1995, alongside the release of Windows 95, as a subscription-based dial-up online service called The Microsoft Network; this later became an Internet service provider named MSN Dial-up. At the same time, the company launched a new web portal named Microsoft Internet Start and set it as the first default home page of Internet Explorer, its web browser. In 1998, Microsoft renamed and moved this web portal to the domain name www.msn.com, where it has remained since. Microsoft subsequently used the &#x27;MSN&#x27; brand name for a wide variety of products and services over the years, notably Hotmail (later Outlook.com), Messenger (which was once synonymous with &#x27;MSN&#x27; in Internet slang), and its web search engine, which is now Bing, and several other rebranded and discontinued services. In 2014, Microsoft reworked and relaunched the MSN website and suite of apps offered.

== History ==
=== Microsoft Internet Start ===

From 1995 to 1998, the MSN.com domain was used by Microsoft primarily to promote MSN as an online service and Internet service provider. At the time, MSN.com also offered a custom start page and an Internet tutorial, but Microsoft&#x27;s major web portal was known as &quot;Microsoft Internet Start&quot;, and was located at home.microsoft.com.

Internet Start served as the default home page for Internet Explorer and offered basic information such as news, weather, sports, stocks, entertainment reports, links to other websites on the Internet, articles by Microsoft staff members, and software updates for Windows. Microsoft&#x27;s original news website (now NBCNews.com) which launched in 1996, was also tied closely to the Internet Start portal.

=== MSN.com ===
In 1998, the largely underutilized &#x27;MSN.com&#x27; domain name was combined with Microsoft Internet Start and reinvented as both a web portal and as the brand for a family of sites produced inside Microsoft&#x27;s Interactive Media Group. The new website put MSN in direct competition with sites such as Yahoo!, Excite, and Go Network. Because the new format opened up MSN&#x27;s content to the world for free, the Internet service provider and subscription service were renamed to MSN Internet Access at that time. (That service eventually became known as MSN Dial-up.)

The relaunched MSN.com contained a whole family of sites, including original content, channels that were carried over from &#x27;web shows&#x27; that were part of Microsoft&#x27;s MSN 2.0 experiment with its Internet service provider in 1996–97, and new features that were rapidly added. MSN.com became the successor to the default Internet Explorer start page, as all of the previous &#x27;Microsoft Internet Start&#x27; website was merged with MSN.com.

Some of the original websites that Microsoft launched during that era remain active in some form today. Microsoft Investor, a business news and investments service that was once produced in conjunction with CNBC, is now MSN Money; CarPoint, an automobile comparison and shopping service, is now MSN Autos; and the Internet Gaming Zone, a website offering online casual games, is now MSN Games. Other websites since divested by Microsoft include the travel website Expedia, the online magazine Slate, and the local event and city search website Sidewalk.com.

In the late 1990s, Microsoft collaborated with many other service providers, as well as other Microsoft departments, to expand the range of MSN&#x27;s services. Some examples include MSN adCenter, MSN Shopping (affiliated with eBay, PriceGrabber and Shopping.com), and the Encarta encyclopedia with various levels of access to information.

Since then, MSN.com has remained a popular destination, launching many new services and content sites. MSN&#x27;s Hotmail and Messenger services were promoted from the MSN.com portal, which provided a central place for all of MSN&#x27;s content. MSN Search (now Bing), a dedicated search engine, launched in 1999. The single sign-in service for Microsoft&#x27;s online services, Microsoft Passport (now Microsoft account), also launched across all MSN services in 1999. The MSN.com portal and related group of services under the &#x27;MSN&#x27; umbrella remained largely the same in the early 2000s.

The sports section of the MSN portal was ESPN.com from 2001 to 2004, and FoxSports.com from 2004 to 2014. MSN had an exclusive partnership with MSNBC.com for news content from 1996 until 2012, when Microsoft sold its remaining stake in msnbc.com to NBCUniversal and the website was renamed NBCNews.com. Since then, MSN has launched &#x27;MSN News&#x27;, an in-house news operation.

As of May 2005, MSN.com was the second most visited portal website in the United States with a share of 23.2 percent, behind Yahoo! which held a majority.

MSN released a preview of an updated home page and logo on November 3, 2009. It was originally expected to be widely available to over 100 million U.S. customers by early 2010. MSN rolled out the newer logo, together with a redesign of the overall website, on December 25, 2009.

In 2012, MSN announced on its blog that it would be unveiling a new version of the MSN.com home page on October 26, exclusively for Windows 8, saying that the new version would be &quot;clean, simple, and built for touch&quot;. Microsoft said it would be more app-like due to the speed of Internet Explorer 10. More new features included &#x27;Flip Ahead&#x27;, which allowed users to swipe from one article to the next. MSN for Windows 8 also had new deals with the AP and Reuters.

=== Rebranding of services ===

Many of MSN&#x27;s services were reorganized in 2005 and 2006 under a new brand name that Microsoft championed at the time, Windows Live. This move was part of Microsoft&#x27;s strategy to improve its online offerings using the Windows brand name. The company also overhauled its online software and services due to increasing competition from rivals such as Yahoo! and Google. The new name was introduced one service at a time. The group of Windows Live services used Web 2.0 technology to offer features and functionality through a web browser that were traditionally only available through dedicated software programs.

Some of the MSN services affected by the rebranding included MSN Hotmail, which became Windows Live Hotmail (now Outlook.com); MSN Messenger, which became Windows Live Messenger (now integrated into Skype); MSN Search, which became Live Search (now known as Bing); MSN Virtual Earth, which became Live Search Maps (now Bing Maps); MSN Spaces, which became Windows Live Spaces; MSN Alerts, which became Windows Live Alerts; and MSN Groups, which became Windows Live Groups. Some other services, such as MSN Direct, remained a part of the MSN family without transitioning to Windows Live.

Following the launch of Windows Live, the MSN brand took on a different focus. MSN became primarily an online content provider of news, entertainment, and common interest topics through its web portal, MSN.com, while Windows Live provided most of Microsoft&#x27;s online software and services. In 2012, Microsoft began to phase out the Windows Live brand, referring to each service separately by its individual brand name without any &#x27;Windows&#x27; prefix or association.

=== Subsequent redesign ===
Microsoft launched a completely rewritten and redesigned MSN website, making use of the company&#x27;s modern design language, on September 30, 2014. The new MSN portal features a new version of the logo that follows a style similar to other current Microsoft products. The website no longer offers original content, instead of employing editors to repurpose existing content from partners at popular and trusted organizations. Much of the existing content on MSN was eliminated as the website was simplified into a new home page and categories, some of which have corresponding apps:

* News: The latest news headlines and articles from a variety of hand-picked sources. Synced with the News app.
* Weather: Current weather conditions, forecasts, maps, news, and traffic. Synced with the Weather app.
* Entertainment: TV, movies, music, and celebrity news, as well as theater showtimes, tickets, and TV listings. Based on the former Bing Entertainment service. Also includes the MSN Games website for online casual games.
* Sports: Up-to-the-minute scores, standings, and headlines from leagues worldwide. Synced with the Sports app.
* Money: Stock market tickers and watchlists, personal finance, real estate, investments, currency converter, and more. Synced with the Money app.
* Lifestyle: Headlines, features, and other content related to style, home &amp; garden, family, smart living, relationships, and horoscopes.
* Health &amp; Fitness: Tools and information about weight loss, strength, exercise, nutrition, medicine, and more.
* Food &amp; Drink: Recipes, cooking tips, news from chefs, cocktails, and shopping lists.
* Travel: Destinations, trip ideas, hotel search, flight search, flight status, and arrivals and departures. Previously based on Farecast.
* Autos: Research and buying advice, auto-related news, information for enthusiasts, and coverage of auto shows worldwide.
* Video: Trending and viral videos, comedy and pop culture, and videos from other MSN categories. Integrates with video search from Bing Videos.

The top of the home page provides access to Microsoft services Bing, Outlook.com, Skype, Office Online, OneNote, OneDrive, Bing Maps, and Groove Music, as well as popular social media services Facebook and Twitter. Signing into MSN with a Microsoft account allows for personalized content to appear and to be synchronized across devices on the website and in the corresponding apps. The redesign of the website led to the closure of MSN&#x27;s longtime personalized home page service &#x27;My MSN&#x27;, which was made up of customized RSS feeds, as the new website no longer supports user-specified RSS content. However, it added some customizability, allowing each category on the home page to be reordered or hidden.

With the 2014 relaunch, MSN now supports responsive design and eliminates the need for a separate mobile website. The redesign of MSN proved positive and helped increase traffic with an additional 10 million daily visitors after two months.

In 2022, Microsoft began phasing out MSN for Microsoft Start, with news pages being moved to Start, and ads for the website appearing on the homepage. This was reversed in November 2024, with the Microsoft Start page redirecting back to MSN.

Microsoft brought back the MSN app in November 2024.

== Apps ==

The MSN web-based apps provides users information from sources that publish to MSN.

Microsoft launched these apps along with the 2014 redesign of the MSN web portal, rebranding many of the Bing apps that originally shipped with Windows and Windows Phone. News, Weather, Sports, Money, and Travel first shipped with Windows 8, while Health &amp; Fitness and Food &amp; Drink first appeared in Windows 8.1. In December 2014, the apps became available across all the other major mobile device platforms as well: iOS, Android, and Fire OS.

The apps allow users a reasonable amount of freedom to decide which sources provide information. Each app has its own color code that is used on the live tile and internally. Originally, each app brought a unified experience with the MSN website and synchronized preferences across devices.

There are currently four apps in the suite: Start (previously News), Weather, Sports, and Money. In July 2015, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of the Food &amp; Drink, Health &amp; Fitness, and Travel apps on all platforms, and that they will not be bundled with Windows 10; those three apps are no longer offered.

After Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Nokia&#x27;s mobile phone division, Microsoft also started bundling MSN services with its Nokia-branded feature phones, though the only supported model was the Nokia 215. In addition to these apps, Microsoft developed a separate set of mobile apps specifically for MSN China.

=== Microsoft Start ===
Microsoft Start (previously named Microsoft News) was a news aggregator and service that featured news headlines and articles chosen by editors. The app includes sections for top stories, U.S., world, money, technology, entertainment, opinion, sports, and crime, along with other miscellaneous stories. It allows users to set their own personalized favorite topics and sources, receive notifications of breaking news through alerts, filter preferred news sources, and alter font sizes to make articles easier to read.

Originally, Start included an RSS feed, but that capability was removed; Microsoft currently only allows users to subscribe to specified news sources, thereby curating news. Start uses the chaseable live tile feature introduced in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. If a user clicks on the Microsoft News Start menu tile when a particular story is shown, the user will see a link to that story at the top of the app when it launches.

=== Weather ===
MSN Weather (originally named Bing Weather) shows weather from a user&#x27;s current location or any other location worldwide, and it allows users to define their favorite places, which will synchronize back to the Microsoft Start and across devices. Users can pin Weather tiles to the Start menu to see local weather conditions from multiple locations at a glance. It also offers satellite maps and has information regarding ski resorts. The app receives its weather conditions and forecasts from a variety of sources internationally. Weather uses weather conditions as the background, making it the only app that does not have a light/dark switch in Windows 10. Weather is not available for iOS; however, it comes preinstalled on the Nokia 215 phone from Microsoft Mobile that runs Series 30+; it is currently the only feature phone to have the app built-in.

=== Money ===
MSN Money (originally MoneyCentral, then MSN Moneycentral, before being rebranded as MSN Money in the mid-2000s - prior to being relaunched as a spin-off of Bing Finance) allows users to set up lists of publicly listed companies to watch, follow certain corporations and receive stock updates, get the latest headlines regarding international markets, view real-time trading figures with a 30-minute delay, track their own personal finances, calculate mortgages, get information on bonds and other financial assets, and convert currency.

=== Esports Hub ===
MSN Esports (often referred to as MSN Esports Hub) is a Bing intelligence AI curated webpage for the growing esports industry. Users can watch integrated streams from YouTube or Twitch. Microsoft&#x27;s advanced AI called &quot;Watch For&quot;, the algorithm originally made for Microsoft&#x27;s Mixer is an artificial intelligence that uses computer vision algorithms on livestreams so that it can alert the viewer of significant moments. This algorithm is implemented in the MSN Esports Hub. Users can also check the calendar for dates of upcoming e-sport events and tournaments or the news for updates on games and their tournament. After the creation of the MSN Esports Hub, Microsoft acquired Smash.gg; an e-sport tournament platform. 
=== Discontinued apps ===

==== Food &amp; Drink ====
MSN Food &amp; Drink (originally named Bing Food &amp; Drink) is a discontinued recipe app that offers news related to foods and drinks, a personal shopping list that synchronizes across devices and the web, and a wine encyclopedia that contains information on over 1.5million bottles of wine, over 3.3million tasting notes, and hundreds of cocktail recipes. Users can control the app hands-free, add their own recipes from physical cookbooks or personal recipes by snapping a photo, add notes to recipes, and sort the recipes into collections. The app also collects information from famous chefs and lists them according to their style of cuisine.

==== Health &amp; Fitness ====
MSN Health &amp; Fitness (originally named Bing Health &amp; Fitness) allowed users to track their intake of calories, look up nutritional information for hundreds of thousands of different foods, use a built-in GPS tracker, view step-by-step workouts and exercises with images and videos, check symptoms for various health conditions, and synchronize their health data to third-party devices such as activity trackers. MSN Health &amp; Fitness formerly connected data with the Microsoft HealthVault, but it started using a Microsoft account with MSN&#x27;s own cloud service to synchronize data when it was rebranded from Bing to MSN. The app is not related in any way to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Fitness or Microsoft Health (the companion app for the Microsoft Band), despite being similar in function.

==== Sports ====
MSN Sports (originally named Bing Sports) displayed various sports scores and standings from hundreds of leagues around the world, as well as aggregated sports-related articles and news headlines. Sports also allowed the user to view slideshows and photo galleries, look up information about individual players and fantasy leagues, and set and track their favorite teams by selecting various topics from the hamburger menu. It also powered various predictive features within Microsoft&#x27;s Cortana virtual assistant.

It was discontinued on July 20, 2021, in favor of the web portal.

==== Travel ====
MSN Travel (originally named Bing Travel) was a travel search engine that allows users to book hotels and flights, aggregates travel-related headlines, and offers detailed information about thousands of travel destinations. Data in the app is powered by various travel websites, including Expedia, formerly owned by Microsoft. Other features include finding information on local restaurants, viewing pictures (including panoramas) and historical data about destinations, and reading reviews by previous travelers. If the user is signed in, Cortana can track flights and get hotel information through the app. MSN Travel was the only app in the suite that was exclusive to Windows. The app was discontinued in September 2015 but can still be accessed via the web.

Previously, Microsoft had acquired &quot;Farecast&quot; in 2008, a website in the computer reservations system industry that offered predictions regarding the best time to purchase airline tickets. Farecast was founded in 2003 and collected over 175 billion airfare observations by 2007. Farecast&#x27;s team of data miners used these airfare observations to build algorithms to predict future airfare price movements. Microsoft integrated it as part of its Live Search group of tools in May 2008 as &quot;Live Search Farecast&quot;; Microsoft rebranded it as &quot;Bing Travel&quot; on June 3, 2009, as part of its efforts to create a new search identity. In 2009, there were allegations that Bing Travel had copied its layouts from Kayak.com; Microsoft denied the allegations. By January 2013, Bing Travel results were powered by Kayak.com. As of January 2014, the fare prediction feature had been removed. As of May 2015, Microsoft rebranded the service to &quot;MSN Travel&quot;. In August 2015, MSN Travel flight search pages changed from being powered by Kayak.com to its competitor Skyscanner.

=== Older mobile apps ===
Microsoft first offered content from its MSN web portal on mobile devices in the early 2000s, through a service called &quot;Pocket MSN&quot; (in line with its Pocket PC products of the era) and later renamed &quot;MSN Mobile&quot;. The original MSN Mobile software was preloaded on many cell phones and PDAs, and usually provided access to legacy MSN services like blogs (MSN Spaces), email (Hotmail), instant messaging (MSN Messenger), and web search (now called Bing). Some wireless carriers charged a premium to access it. As many former MSN properties were spun off to Bing, Windows Live, and other successors in the late 2000s, the Microsoft Mobile Services division took over the development of mobile apps related to those services.

In the meantime, Microsoft&#x27;s MSN apps took on a more content-related focus, as did the web portal itself. Previous versions of MSN apps that were bundled with Windows Mobile and early versions of Windows Phone, as well as MSN apps for Android and iOS devices in the early 2010s, were primarily repositories for news articles found on MSN.com. Other earlier MSN mobile apps included versions of MSN Weather and MSN Money for Windows Mobile 6.5, MSN Money Stocks, and a men&#x27;s magazine called &#x27;MSN OnIt&#x27; for Windows Phone 7.

== International ==
Microsoft&#x27;s world headquarters is in the United States, so the main MSN website is based there. However, MSN has offered various international versions of its portal since its inception in 1995 for dozens of countries around the world. A list of international MSN affiliates is available at MSN Worldwide.

Following the redesign and relaunch of the MSN web portal in 2014, most international MSN websites share the same layout as the U.S. version and are largely indistinguishable from it, aside from their content. There were two exceptions: ninemsn, a longtime partnership between Microsoft and the Nine Network in Australia that launched in 1997 (Microsoft sold its stake in the venture in 2013 and ended its co-branding with Nine in 2016); and MSN China, an entirely customized version of MSN for China (Microsoft discontinued the portal in 2016, replacing it with a page that links to a number of other Chinese websites).

<doc id="185046" wikidata="Q324113" url="?curid=185046" title="Summer Triangle">
<text>The Summer Triangle is an astronomical asterism in the northern celestial hemisphere. The defining vertices of this imaginary triangle are at Altair, Deneb, and Vega, each of which is the brightest star of its constellation (Aquila, Cygnus, and Lyra, respectively). The greatest declination is +45° and lowest is +9° meaning the three can be seen from all places in the Northern Hemisphere and from the home of most people resident in the Southern Hemisphere. The two stars in Aquila and Cygnus represent the head of an eagle and tail of a swan that looks east inscribed into the triangle and forming the altitude of the triangle. Two small constellations, Sagitta and Vulpecula, lie between Aquila in the south of the triangle and Cygnus and Lyra to the north.

==History==
The term was popularized by American author H. A. Rey and British astronomer Patrick Moore in the 1950s. The name can be found in constellation guidebooks as far back as 1913. The Austrian astronomer Oswald Thomas described these stars as &quot;Grosses Dreieck&quot; (Great Triangle) in the late 1920s and &quot;Sommerliches Dreieck&quot; (Summerly Triangle) in 1934. The asterism was remarked upon by Joseph Johann von Littrow, who described it as the &quot;conspicuous triangle&quot; in the text of his atlas (1866), and Johann Elert Bode connected the stars in a map in a book in 1816, although without label. These are the same stars recognized in the Chinese legend of &quot;The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl&quot;, a story dating back some 2,600 years, celebrated in the Qixi Festival. The stars also bear ceremonial significance in the related celebrations of Tanabata, Chilseok, and Thất Tịch, derived from Qixi. In the mid- to late-20th century, before inertial navigation systems and other electronic and mechanical equipment took their places in military aircraft, United States Air Force navigators referred to this asterism as the &quot;Navigator&#x27;s Triangle&quot;.

==Visibility==
From mid-to-tropical northern latitudes:
*the centre of the triangle appears about overhead around solar midnight during summer, and exactly so at about the 27th parallel north. This means it rises at sunset in the east and sets at sunrise in the west. 
*it is visible in the eastern sky in early mornings during spring. 
*In autumn and winter evenings, it is visible in the western sky until January. 

From mid-southern latitudes, the asterism is in the north during the culmination season described above.

==The stars of the Summer Triangle==
Both Altair and Vega are bluish-white, rapidly-rotating A-type main sequence stars in the local neighbourhood of the sun. However, Deneb is a white supergiant star over 100 times as distant, and one of the most luminous stars in the entire galaxy.
