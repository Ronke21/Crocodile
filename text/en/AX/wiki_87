<text>Nominet UK is currently delegated by IANA to be the manager of the .uk domain name. Nominet directly manages registrations directly under .uk, and some of the second level domains .co.uk, .org.uk, .sch.uk, .me.uk, .net.uk, .ltd.uk and .plc.uk.

Nominet also manages the .wales and .cymru domains.

As of February 2021, the .uk register held 10,922,477 .uk domain names. This represents a year-on-year downward trend, when compared to February 2020, this is mainly due to the lapsing of the recently launched .uk domain names.

Nominet was founded by Dr. Willie Black and five others on 14 May 1996 when its predecessor, the &quot;Naming Committee&quot; was unable to deal with the volume of registrations then being sought under the .uk domain. Nominet is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. It has members who act as shareholders, but without the right to participate in the profits of the company. Anyone can become a member, but most members are internet service providers who are also registrars.

Customers wishing to register a domain can approach Nominet directly but will generally register the domain via a domain registrar – a business entity authorized by Nominet to register and manage .uk domains on behalf of customers. Registrars for .uk domains were formerly known as &quot;tagholders&quot;.

Nominet also deals with disputes about registrations of .uk domain names, via its Dispute Resolution Service (DRS) which is similar to the UDRP system used for generic Top Level Domain Names, but with certain innovations such as a free mediation service.

In 2008 Nominet launched a charitable foundation, the Nominet Trust, and contributed some of its profits to it. In May 2018 Nominet relinquished control over the organisation, which was renamed Social Tech Trust and announced a &quot;strategic partnership with Social Tech Business&quot;. By 2020 the income of Social Tech Trust had fallen to £99,000 from £5.6 million in 2018.

In February 2021 over 140 members requested an extraordinary general meeting to vote on removing five board directors, including the chair, and to appoint Michael Lyons, former chairman of the BBC, and Axel Pawlik, former Managing Director of RIPE NCC. The EGM was held on 22 March 2021 and the five directors were removed. Rob Binns, a former Group Treasurer at HP Inc. and then CFO at The Access Group, was appointed as acting chair.

== History ==

Most countries have their own top-level domain (TLD). The .uk TLD was first used in 1985. and at that time a voluntary group called the &quot;Naming Committee&quot; managed the registration of .uk domain names. This consisted of members of LINX as full members (the main ISPs in the UK), and their resellers as guest members. By the mid-1990s, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who registered domains for their customers were joined by a new breed of domain name specialists who had an entrepreneurial attitude to domain names. The Naming Committee operated a ruleset that forced all name registrations to &#x27;exactly&#x27; match the name of the registering company and also limited all companies to a single domain name. The growth of the commercial internet soon brought these restrictions into close focus.
As demand for domain name registrations grew, it became clear that a voluntary group could no longer cope with the volume of registrations being requested. It also became clear that the existing ruleset was not sustainable and the Naming Committee was going to break down under the pressure of registrations.

===Forming of Nominet UK===
When it became clear that a new organization with a new approach was needed to manage the .uk TLD, the Naming Committee mailing list had mutated into a discussion group for domain name issues and many discussions about what type of corporation the Registry should be were held. Meanwhile, at UKERNA, Dr. Willie Black and John Carey were watching the situation and in 1996 John Carey wrote a proposed plan for a new organization to be called Nominet. This was distributed widely, and a meeting to discuss ways forward was held at a hotel at Heathrow Airport on 11 April 1996.

The options to set up as a profit-making company or a charity were rejected, and Nominet was established on 14 May 1996 as a private, not-for-profit membership company, limited by guarantee. Whilst the move was generally popular, there was strong resistance from some parts of the industry. Although formed with a board composed of Dr. Black (who became the first CEO of the new company), John Carey, and the four co-founders drawn from the internet industry, elections were held by the new membership which resulted in the first elected board members to oversee the growth of the UK domain name industry. John Carey resigned before taking up his role following a disagreement over the creation of police.uk

===Pre-Nominet domain names===
From Nominet&#x27;s inception on 1 July 1996 until 2002 domains registered pre-Nominet were provided free of charge. In 2002, as had been hinted at its inception in 1996, Nominet began a process over two years of migrating those domains onto Nominet standard terms and conditions and implementing charging. Those domains can be identified within the whois results as having a registration date of before August 1996.

== Controversy ==

In 2011 &quot;The Independent&quot; published an article containing quotes about people trying to demutualize Nominet for their own benefit.

=== Failure of investments ===
Under the tenure of Russell Haworth, a former mergers and acquisition specialist, Nominet invested heavily into autonomous vehicles, the Internet of things, and white-space spectrum management which did not pan out. Despite these outcomes, board salaries continued to rise.

===Structural issues===
Nominet&#x27;s success brought with it several structural concerns. Over time, it built considerable cash reserves. In 1999, candidates stood for the board on a platform similar to &#x27;carpetbagging&#x27; attempts with mutual building societies; whilst this was defeated, following a financial report from Alex Bligh, one of the founders, covering the potential conflict between turning a profit to maintaining sufficient financial reserves and its goal of maintaining long-term profit and loss neutrality.

Nominet has consistently increased the salaries of its employees, especially directors. Average salaries have increased from £28,542 in 2002 to £60,276 in 2014. In the same period, the highest-paid director went from £125,000 to £308,000.

=== Closure of Members&#x27; Forum ===
Speaking at Nominet&#x27;s 2020 annual general meeting (AGM), the organization&#x27;s CEO Russell Haworth shocked members by announcing he was shutting down its internal web forum – the only means of independent communication between members – effective immediately.

=== Voting irregularities ===
Nominet admitted it wrongly calculated election results for its board of directors in 2018 and 2019.

=== Domain names ===
In 2019, customers of 123-Reg and Namesco were invoiced for domain names that were reserved for free by Nominet.

.uk registry watchers noticed unexpected changes in ownership of various .uk names, including sunset.uk, waterfall.uk, pad.uk and trending.uk, all of which were sold by Fasthosts to one or more industry insiders in advance of the domains being released by Nominet rather than going through the proper public process.

Nominet introduction of .uk to compete with .co.uk and .org.uk has resulted in increased cost to UK brand owners and caused much confusion amongst registrants.

In July 2020 Nominet announced a new policy consultation for expiring .uk domain names, but it has been mired with controversy as it seems not to be in the public&#x27;s benefit.

== 2021 removal of directors ==
On 29 January 2021, an email request was made to Rory Kelly, the Nominet company secretary to provide a list of members of Nominet.

On 3 February 2021, Rory Kelly, company secretary responded to the request by printing out the Nominet members list on 575 sheets of A4 paper, omitting the contact email addresses of members, and posting the bundle to the registered company address of the original requester. In response, the recipient Krystal Hosting arranged for 575 trees to be planted &quot;to offset Nominet&#x27;s nonsense&quot;.

On 2 February 2021, over 140 members wrote to the board of directors via Rory Kelly the company secretary calling for a general meeting to propose two ordinary resolutions:

# Remove Eleanor Bradley, Russell Haworth, Ben Hill, Jane Tozer and Mark Wood as directors before expiration of their respective periods of office and despite anything in any agreement between them and Nominet UK; and
# Appoint Sir Michael Lyons and Axel Pawlik as directors.
Rory Kelly, Company Secretary stated that the number of votes each member was entitled to cast would not be released until the results had been published.

Following the EGM the motion to remove the directors was passed, confirming the removal of the five board directors. Nominet stated that &quot;Eleanor Bradley and Ben Hill remain in their executive posts.&quot;

=== Voting pledges ===
Nominet announced that they would not release the number of votes each member is entitled to cast, including to the members themselves, until after the vote had taken place. The voting rights of the members were subsequently released after the EGM.

In the lead up to the vote at the EGM a number of Nominet members publicly announced their position on the resolution to be tabled at the EGM:

Publicly for:
# Tucows, the largest domain registrar, announced they would support the removal of the directors.
# Namecheap
# LINX, the UK&#x27;s largest Internet peering point, following a unanimous board decision.
#Krystal Hosting, the company whose owner started the campaign.

Publicly against:
# Blacknight

Publicly abstained:
# Google announced that it did not intend to vote on the motion.

===Result===
The Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) was held on 22 March 2021. The motion to remove the five directors from the board was carried with 53.5% of the votes for the motion, and 47.26% against.

Five of the original Nominet founders (Richard Almeida, Willie Black, Alex Bligh, Keith Mitchell, and Nigel Titley) pledged their &quot;commitment to support Sir Michael Lyons and Axel Pawlik if they are appointed to the board of Nominet UK, in whatever way we reasonably can with matters relating to the future of Nominet&quot;.

===Response===
By 31 March 2021, Nominet had made four internal appointments:
# Rob Binns, as acting chair of the Board (a previous board member)
# Eleanor Bradley, as interim CEO (Nominet , and former board member)
# Rory Kelly, as board member (Nominet Company Secretary)
# Adam Leach, as board member (Nominet Chief Information Officer)

Appointment of Kelly and Leach to the board had occurred on 22 March 2021, corresponding to the date of the EGM.

On 7 April 2021, Bradley, as interim CEO, stated that Nominet would begin to regularly publish the voting rights of members.

On 12 April 2021 Sir Michael Lyons and Alex Pawlik sent a joint letter to the acting Chair Rob Binns. The remnant board of Nominet subsequently announced: &quot;After much careful consideration, the board has decided not to invite Sir Michael to be acting chair&quot;.

By 13 April 2021 Nominet had selected Russell Reynolds Associates to seek a replacement chair of Nominet on an initial three-year term.

By 15 April 2021 survey responses from 200 Nominet members that had supported the earlier EGM, showed 97% support for calling a second EGM, with confidence in the board decreasing to 1.3 out of 10.

On 22 July 2021, Nominet stated that CBE had been appointed new chair of the board, along with Eva Lindqvist as a new independent director, from 21 July 2021. Priorities would be reduction of costs and executive pay, re-building of trust with the membership, and restoration of Nominet&#x27;s public benefit purpose and charitable proceeds.

===2021 Annual General Meeting===
Nominet&#x27;s Annual General Meeting (AGM) was scheduled for 18 November 2021. Prior to the AGM, elections were held to appoint two new member-elected non-executive directors to the Nominet board. Public Benefit candidates received the highest votes, having Simon Blackler elected immediately with over 50 percent of first-preference votes, followed by Ashley of Tucows taking 35% of the vote. Blackler and replaced out-going directors James Bladel of GoDaddy (who had not stood for re-election), and David Thornton, who &quot;defended the previous management&#x27;s actions&quot;, had received six percent of the votes. It was announced that BCS CEO Paul Fletcher would takeover as Nominet CEO from February 2022.

Votes held at the 2021 AGM formally appointed Andy Green and Eva Lindqvist, both for three years, with over 94% of votes. Stephen Page (who &quot;was opposed by the Public Benefit campaign&quot;) received 51.4% of weighted votes for an extension of one year as a director.

==2022==
Paul Fletcher was appointed as replacement CEO of Nominet starting in February 2022. In the first days Fletcher joined the board and held a meeting with members.

On 10 March 2022, Nominet announced it would be &quot;not accepting registrations from registrars in Russia – we are suspending the relevant tags&quot; and in doing so became the first previously neutral ccTLD in history to reposition itself as non-neutral.

== Non-core activities ==

Nominet also delivers the National Cyber Security Centre&#x27;s Protective Domain Name Service (PDNS) since 2016, protecting the UK public sector&#x27;s internet traffic.

A £4 million investment into registry services was announced in February 2020 alongside the acquisition of US-based cyber security company CyGlass.

Ahead of the 1991 event the Maltese broadcaster had been told by the contest organisers that they would only be allowed to remain in the competition if another nation dropped out of the event, however after placing sixth in the 1991 contest, the organisers instead decided to raise the maximum number of participating countries to twenty-three to make space for continued Maltese participation. The contest marked the final participation of , whose entry represented the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the first and only time, following the break-up of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the past year which had been responsible for all previous Yugoslav entries; following the 1992 contest Yugoslavia was excluded from participating and the nation would not return to the contest until , when it competed under its new name . The 1992 contest was notable in the fact that only two countries which had previously participated in past editions of the event were absent from the contest, namely and .

Among the competing entries at this year&#x27;s contest was the first entry to be performed in a French Creole language, and the first appearance of a song performed in Luxembourgish since .

== Production and format ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1992 was produced by the Swedish public broadcaster (SVT). served as executive producer, served as producer and director, Göran Arfs served as designer, and Anders Berglund served as musical director leading an assembled orchestra of around 50 musicians. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Frank Naef as scrutineer.

Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-three competing countries, the draw to determine the running order was held on 3 December 1991 and was conducted by Carola.

The results of the 1992 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, between men and women, and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

The stage design for the Malmö contest centred around a large representation of the bow of a Viking ship, flanked on either side by sets of stairs, while a hexagonal design was used for the floor area in front which was painted to resemble the Eurovision network logo. To the left of the stage as seen by the audience sat the orchestra, while to the right stood a large video wall and a smaller stage for use by the presenters to introduce each act and during the voting sequence. Behind the Viking ship the backdrop featured a representation using neon lighting of the span of the Öresund Bridge, the construction of which had yet to begin but which would connect Sweden and Denmark, and thus connecting Sweden with the bulk of the European mainland from 1999.

Rehearsals in the contest venue began on 3 May 1992, focussing on the opening performances and interval act. The participating artists began their rehearsals on 4 May, and each participating delegation was afforded two technical rehearsals in the week of the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals, held on 4 and 5 May, saw each country given a 40-minute slot on stage, followed by a press conference. Each delegation was then given a second slot to rehearse on stage, this time for 30 minutes, on 6 and 7 May. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 8 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 9 May. Audiences were present for the latter two dress rehearsals, and the final afternoon dress rehearsal was also recorded for use as a production stand-by. During the contest week the participating delegations were also invited to a welcome reception, which was held in . The Yugoslav representative had been given additional security in the form of bodyguards and a doctor due to the breakout of the Yugoslav Wars.

This year&#x27;s contest featured a mascot: the &quot;Eurobird&quot;, an anthropomorphic bird, featured as a computer animated character during the transition between the competing songs.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1991 was the 36th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 4 May 1991 at Stage 15 of the Studios in Rome, Italy. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RAI), and presented by Gigliola Cinquetti and Toto Cutugno, the contest was held in Italy following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot; by Toto Cutugno.

Twenty-two countries participated in the event: made its first Eurovision Song Contest appearance in sixteen years, having last participated in , while the decided not to participate due to the date of this year&#x27;s event coinciding with the country&#x27;s annual Remembrance of the Dead commemorations. It was also the first time that was represented as a single state following the reunification of East and West Germany.

For the first time since , the contest resulted in a draw for first place, with both and being awarded the same number of points. The contest&#x27;s tie-break procedure was implemented for the first time in its history, which resulted in Sweden being declared the winner due to their entry, &quot;&quot;, written by Stephan Berg and performed by Carola, having received a greater number of top scores from the other competing countries than the French entry; it was Sweden&#x27;s third contest victory overall. Alongside France, , and rounded out the top five countries.

==Location==
The 1991 contest took place in Rome, Italy, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot;, performed by Toto Cutugno. It was the second time that Italy had hosted the contest, following the held in Naples. The chosen venue was Stage 15 of the Studios, the largest film studios in Europe which had previously been the filming location for a number of blockbuster American and Italian movies, particularly during the 1950s and 1960s.

The Italian organisers had originally intended that the contest be held in the in Sanremo, where the annual Sanremo Music Festival is held. The Sanremo festival had been a major influence and inspiration for the formation of the Eurovision Song Contest, and RAI had wanted to pay tribute to the contest&#x27;s origins by hosting the event in the town. The choice of Sanremo and Ariston as host of the event was initially rejected by the EBU, citing concerns regarding the size of the venue as well as organisational and security shortcomings. In an effort to address some of the concerns, the of Sanremo proposed hosting the event in three locations across the Ariston area, with the Teatro Ariston, and the old flower market on being combined using temporary structures to form a single venue. Although plans to hold the contest in Sanremo continued to be developed as late as January 1991, by February doubts over the feasibility of holding the event in Sanremo became insurmountable, due to instability in the Middle East and the outbreak of the Gulf War, and ultimately the organisers opted to relocate the contest to a more secure location, eventually confirming on 18 February that the event would be held in Rome. Despite the relocation Sanremo remained a partner of the 1991 contest and pre-recorded footage of the city was featured during the live broadcast.

==Participating countries==


A total of twenty-two countries participated in the 1991 contest. Of the countries that participated in 1990, the were the only country that failed to make a return, as the date of the contest clashed with the country&#x27;s Remembrance of the Dead commemorations. which had last participated in the contest sixteen years before, in ultimately filled the vacant slot. The nation had for a number of years attempted to make a return to the contest, however was prevented from doing so due to the cap on participation numbers set by the EBU. This marked the first time that competed as a unified country, following the reunification of East and West Germany into a single state; until this point all German entrants in previous contests had represented the former West Germany.

Several artists that had previously competed in the contest returned to participate in this year&#x27;s event: Stefán Hilmarsson, who competed alongside for , was a member of Beathoven that had participated for the nation in ; Thomas Forstner made a second appearance for following the ; Carola also returned to the contest for the second time for after her participation in ; and the members of &#x27;s Just 4 Fun featured two previous participating artists, namely Eiríkur Hauksson, who had competed in the for Iceland as part of the group ICY, and Hanne Krogh, who had represented Norway twice before, in as a solo artist and in as a member of the group Bobbysocks!, the latter appearance ultimately winning the contest outright. Additionally, Kit Rolfe performed as backing vocalist for the &#x27;s Samantha Janus, having previously been lead vocalist of the group Belle and the Devotions that had represented the UK at the .


== Production ==
The Eurovision Song Contest 1991 was produced by the Italian public broadcaster (RAI). Silvia Salvetti served as executive producer, served as director, Luciano Ricceri served as designer, and Bruno Canfora served as musical director leading an assembled orchestra of 57 musicians. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Frank Naef as scrutineer.

The running order draw, to determine in which position each country would perform, was held on 18 February 1991, the same date that Rome was confirmed as the host city of the contest and the announcement of the twenty-two competing countries.

Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 29 April 1991. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals of 40 minutes&#x27; duration were held on 29 and 30 April, with the second rehearsals, each lasting 35 minutes, held on 1 and 2 May. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 3 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 4 May. An audience was present for the second dress rehearsal on the evening of 3 May. About 300 journalists covered the event.

The production value of the 1991 contest came in for much criticism during the build-up and following the event, which may be partly explained by the relatively late change in contest venue from Sanremo to Rome. Rehearsals in the contest venue regularly started late as the orchestra failed on many occasions to arrive at the venue on time, and during the live broadcast, a number of technical mishaps occurred, including lighting failure during several of the entries and the failure of the venue&#x27;s sound system during the Swedish entry. The voting sequence was also notably haphazard and several mistakes required rectification during the show, with the EBU&#x27;s executive supervisor Frank Naef regularly called upon by the hosts for clarification.

== Format ==
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all participants were required to have reached the age of 16 in the year of the contest. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

The results of the 1991 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, which was required to be split evenly between men and women and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing. In a change to the rules compared to previous editions, half of the jury members in each country were now represented by music experts, comprising among other professions singers, composers, lyricists, musicians, conductors, music journalists, record company employees and radio or television producers. Only two members in each country were allowed to come from record companies, and no employees of the participating broadcasters themselves were allowed to sit on the juries.

=== Postcards ===
Each entry was preceded by a video postcard which served as an introduction to each country, as well as providing an opportunity for transition between entries and allow stage crew to make changes on stage. The postcards for the 1991 contest featured pre-recorded clips of the competing artists performing short sections from Italian songs, superimposed onto images of Italian landmarks and locations which were intended to represent the artists&#x27; personalities. The song each artist performed during their postcard is listed below by order of performance, alongside the originator of the song in brackets:

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 4 May 1991 at 21:00 (CEST) with a duration of 3 hours and 13 minutes. The show was presented by the Italian singers Gigliola Cinquetti and Toto Cutugno, the two artists which up until this point had won the contest for Italy, in and 1990 respectively. Unlike the majority of previous contest presenters, who had conducted the events in English and French, for the majority of the 1991 contest the two presenters spoke solely in Italian, with only the voting sequence being conducted in Italian, English and French.

The opening of the contest featured a pre-recorded music video of the American singer Sara Carlson performing &quot;Celebration&quot;, which was followed by live performances from the contest hosts of their Eurovision winning songs, Cutugno&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Cinquetti&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. The interval act comprised a performance by the Italian quick-change artist and illusionist Arturo Brachetti. The trophy awarded to the winners was presented at the end of the broadcast by Albert Scharf as the President of the European Broadcasting Union.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, written by Stephan Berg and performed by Carola. It was Sweden&#x27;s third contest victory, following wins in and . For the first time since , and for only the second time ever in the contest&#x27;s history, the voting sequence resulted in a draw for first place, with both and Sweden finishing with 146 points each. The tie-break rules introduced for the were thus enacted: for any ties for first place the country which received the most 12 points would be declared the winner; if a tie still remained after examining the 12 points, each country&#x27;s 10 points would then be compared to determine a winner. Both France and Sweden had scored four 12 point scores, however as Sweden had scored five 10 points compared to France&#x27;s two they were declared the winners. During the traditional winner&#x27;s reprise performance, Carola performed part of the winning song in English, with lyrics written by Richard Hampton.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1990 was the 35th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 5 May 1990 in the Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RTV Zagreb) on behalf of (JRT), and presented by Oliver Mlakar and Helga Vlahović, the contest was held in Yugoslavia following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Rock Me&quot; by the group Riva. It was the first contest to be held in the Balkans and the only to be held in a socialist state.

Twenty-two countries participated in the contest, with the same countries that had participated in 1989 returning. The 1990 contest was the first to implement an age limit on the competing performers, following criticism of the participation of two child performers in the previous year&#x27;s event; all artists were now required to reach the age of sixteen within the year of the contest.

The winner was for the second time in its history, with the song &quot;&quot;, written and performed by Toto Cutugno. and shared second place, with and rounding out the top five countries. France and Spain both placed within the top 5 for the first time in several years, while Iceland recorded their best ever result.

==Location==

The 1990 contest took place in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Rock Me&quot;, performed by the group Riva. It was the first time that Yugoslavia had hosted the contest, and marked the first time the contest had been held in the Balkans and the first edition to be held in a socialist state. The chosen venue was the Vatroslav Lisinski Concert Hall (), named after the 19th-century Croatian composer Vatroslav Lisinski and whose main hall has an audience capacity of over 1,800. Constructed between 1963 and 1971, the venue underwent significant renovation ahead of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Participating countries==

The same twenty-two countries which had participated in 1989 returned for the 1990 contest; this marked the first time since that no changes to the composition of the competing countries were made compared to the previous event.

Among the competing artists in this year&#x27;s event was Ketil Stokkan who was representing for the second time, having previously represented the country at the . Additionally, Kari Kuivalainen, who had also competed in 1986 as &#x27;s entrant, returned as a backing vocalist for the Finnish group Beat, and the Slovene group supported &#x27;s Toto Cutugno as backing vocalists, having previously represented in the .

Many of the competing songs made reference to the changing political and social landscape across the European continent following revolutions in Central and Eastern European countries in 1989 and spoke of the future of the European continent. The and entries referenced the increasing freedoms experienced by citizens in countries formerly under repressive regimes, the and entries harked back to the fall of the Berlin Wall six months prior and the opening of frontiers along the Iron Curtain between east and west Europe, while the made reference to the planned signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992 which would form the European Union and lead to greater European integration. Other social and political messages were also present among the competing entries, including a message for racial harmony from , an ode to the environment from the , and &#x27;s Philippe Lafontaine presenting a love song for his Macedonian wife.


== Production ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1990 was produced by the Yugoslav public broadcaster (RTV Zagreb) on behalf of (JRT). Goran Radman served as executive producer, Nenad Puhovski served as director, Zvjezdana Kvočić served as designer, Seadeta Midžić served as musical director, and Igor Kuljerić served as conductor leading an assembled orchestra, with assistance from . A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host conductors also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Frank Naef as scrutineer. Over 400 journalists covered the event.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-two competing countries, the draw to determine the running order of the contest was held on 10 November 1989.

Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 30 April 1990. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals, comprising 15 minutes for stage set-up and 35 minutes for performances, were held on 30 April and 1 May. Following these rehearsals each delegation was provided an opportunity to watch back recordings of their performances and engage in a press conference. Each country&#x27;s second rehearsals were held on 2 and 3 May and lasted 35 minutes total, followed by another viewing session and press conference. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, two held in the afternoon and evening of 4 May and one final rehearsal in the afternoon of 5 May. An audience was present during the two dress rehearsals held on 4 May; the final dress rehearsal on 5 May was also recorded for use as a production standby for use should broadcast of the live event became impossible.

During the week of rehearsals, problems arose regarding the choice of presenters for the event. Oliver Mlakar and Helga Vlahović had been selected to host the contest, officially announced publicly in March 1990, however a second couple, Rene Medvešek and , had also been chosen as a reserve hosting pair. No agreement on which duo would host the contest had been settled going into the rehearsal week however, and screen tests of the voting sequence with the contest&#x27;s executive supervisor Frank Naef were scheduled to determine which of the pairings would get the job. The ages of Mlakar and Vlahović, respectively 54 and 45 years old at the time, had also resulted in criticism from press outlets ahead of the contest. Subsequently, Mlakar and Vlahović walked away during rehearsals on the Wednesday before the event and announced their resignations as show hosts, leading to a hastily arranged press conference to announce Medvešek and Marković as their replacements. Meetings held behind closed doors over the following 24 hours however led to Mlakar and Vlahović returning to the contest as the show&#x27;s presenters.

For the first time in its history the contest featured an official mascot, &quot;Eurocat&quot;, an animated anthropomorphic cat created by the Croatian illustrator Joško Marušić. Eurocat featured within the video postcards which served as an introduction to each country&#x27;s entry, as well as providing an opportunity for transition between entries and allow stage crew to make changes on stage. The postcards for the 1990 contest centered around the theme of tourism, in conjunction with 1990 being the European Year of Tourism; each participating country commissioned their own postcard to highlight their country as a tourist destination, with Eurocat introducing these clips while highlighting cultural stereotypes associated with the competing countries.

With the advent of music videos during the 1980s, the television production of the contest also adapted to new aesthetics as it entered the 1990s; in contrast to previous editions, the 1990 contest saw an increased use of dynamic camera direction, with footage captured from cameras moving to and around the stage during the performances and showing angles that could not be seen by spectators in the auditorium. This change in the visual aesthetics was part of a transition which made elaborately staged performances possible, bearing similarities to music videos and which went on to develop throughout the 1990s and into editions of the contest held during the twenty-first century.

== Format ==
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers. The 1990 contest was the first to implement restrictions on the age of the performers, following criticism of the young age of the and entrants in the previous year&#x27;s contest, 12-year-old and 11-year-old Nathalie Pâque respectively. For the 1990 event performers were required to be at least 16 years old in the year they competed in the event; although the United Kingdom had selected 15-year-old Emma as their representative, as she turned 16 later in the year she was still eligible to compete. The introduction of this rule, which remains in effect but which now specifies that the contestant must be 16 years old on the day of the contest final, means that Sandra Kim, who won the contest in 1986 for at the age of 13, will hold the record of the youngest ever Eurovision winner in perpetuity, barring any further changes to the rule.

The results of the 1990 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, who were all required to be members of the public with no connection to the music industry, split evenly between men and women and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

== Contest overview ==

The contest took place on 5 May 1990 at 21:00 (CEST) with a duration of 2 hours and 47 minutes and was presented by Oliver Mlakar and Helga Vlahović.

The contest was opened with a pre-recorded film entitled &quot;Zagreb: City of Music&quot;, which showcased various locations in Zagreb and featured performances of various musical styles and genres. Another pre-recorded film featured during the interval between the competing entries and the voting sequence; entitled &quot;Yugoslav Changes&quot;, which highlighted the various cultures, landscapes, cuisines and industries within Yugoslavia. The trophy awarded to the winners was presented at the end of the broadcast by the contest&#x27;s executive producer Goran Radman.

The contest&#x27;s first entry suffered from a technical incident. The conductor of the Spanish entry was unable to hear the backing track, as the sound engineers had failed to raise the volume of the tape, and could not cue the orchestra to commence on time. When the volume was eventually raised the track was already partway through the song, meaning the orchestra and performers were out of sync with the tape, resulting in the two Salazar sisters of Azúcar Moreno leaving the stage as the backing tape continued to play. The tape was ultimately reset and the performance restarted with no further issues.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, written and performed by Toto Cutugno. It was Italy&#x27;s second win in the contest, following their first victory in . At 46 years old Cutugno became the oldest Eurovision winner at that point. achieved their first top 5 placing since , placing equal second with , while &#x27;s fourth place finish was the country&#x27;s best ever result to that point. also achieved their best finish since , placing fifth. The 1990 contest marks the last time that the future &quot;Big Five&quot; countries all placed within the top 10: alongside Italy&#x27;s first place, France&#x27;s equal second place and Spain&#x27;s fifth place finish, the placed sixth and placed ninth.

Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1989 was the 34th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 6 May 1989 in the in Lausanne, Switzerland. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (TSR) on behalf of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR), and presented by Jacques Deschenaux and Lolita Morena, the contest was held in Switzerland following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot; by Céline Dion.

Twenty-two countries participated in the contest, with returning after a one-year absence. Among the participating artists were the two youngest artists to have ever participated in the contest, 12-year-old Gili Netanel and 11-year-old Nathalie Pâque representing and , respectively; the inclusion of the young performers led to some controversy in the run-up to the event, including calls for their exclusion from the contest, and although no action was taken by the organisers of this event it did result in a rule change for the .

The winner was with the song &quot;Rock Me&quot;, composed by Rajko Dujmić, written by Stevo Cvikić and performed by the group Riva. This was Yugoslavia&#x27;s first contest victory in twenty-four attempts. The , , and rounded out the top five positions; the UK and Denmark placed second and third respectively for a second consecutive year, and Austria finished in the top five for the first time since . gained their best result since , while and achieved their worst ever placings to date, placing eighteenth and twenty-second respectively, with Iceland ultimately earning &quot;nul points&quot; and coming last for the first time.

==Location==

The 1989 contest took place in Lausanne, Switzerland, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Céline Dion. It was the second time that Switzerland had hosted the event, following the of the contest held in 1956 in Lugano.

The chosen venue was the , a convention and exhibition centre. The contest took place in the Hall 7 of the , also known as the , which was temporarily renamed in honour of Switzerland&#x27;s first Eurovision winning artist. An audience of around 1,600 people could occupy the during the contest. Over a dozen cities were reported to have applied to host the contest, with Lausanne winning out due to its combination of a suitable production venue, logistical infrastructure availability, and proximity to an international airport.

==Participating countries==

Twenty-two countries participated in the 1989 contest, with the twenty-one countries from the previous year&#x27;s event being joined by , returning after a one-year absence.

For the first time, Switzerland sent an entry in Romansh, the smallest of Switzerland&#x27;s four national languages.

No artists competing in the 1989 contest had previously taken part as lead artists in previous events, however, two of the artists had previously performed in the contest in past editions. The &#x27;s Justine Pelmelay had been one of the backing vocalists supporting the Dutch entrant Gerard Joling in the 1988 event, and &#x27;s Marianna had also performed as a backing vocalist in for Bang. Additionally, Søren Bundgaard who had represented in three previous editions of the contest as a member of the duo Hot Eyes, was one of Birthe Kjær&#x27;s backing performers in this year&#x27;s event.

For the first time since , the event featured two participating songs written by the same songwriters: both the and entries were written by Dieter Bohlen and Joachim Horn-Bernges.

The 1989 contest featured the youngest ever lead performers, in the form of 12-year-old and 11-year-old Nathalie Pâque representing and respectively. Their inclusion in the contest led to controversy and protest from some of the other competitors, who felt their young age should preclude them from the contest. As there were no existing rules regarding the age of performers, the two artists were allowed to compete, however, the controversy led to the introduction of an age restriction on performing artists for the .


== Production ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1989 was produced by the Swiss public broadcaster (TSR) on behalf of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (; ; SRG SSR). Raymond Zumsteg served as executive producer, Alain Bloch served as producer and director, Charles-André Grivet served as director, Paul Waelti served as designer, and Benoît Kaufman served as musical director leading an assembled orchestra of 55 musicians. A separate musical director could be nominated by each country to lead the orchestra during their performance, with the host musical director also available to conduct for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. On behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Frank Naef as scrutineer.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-two competing countries, the draw to determine the running order of the contest was held on 23 November 1988. Production details related to the contest were also shared on this date, including the contest&#x27;s mascot and logo. The mascot, Cindy Aeschbach, an 11-year old girl from Morges, was chosen from among two hundred girls from schools in the Swiss region of to embody the character of Heidi in the contest&#x27;s opening sequence. The logo, designed by Fritz Aeschbach, is a representation of the Matterhorn created with computer graphics, constructed using contour lines to represent the strings of a guitar, and featuring a silhouette outline of Lausanne Cathedral at the base. The presenters of the contest were publicly revealed on 17 January 1989: the sports journalist and television presenter Jacques Deschenaux and the television presenter and Miss Switzerland 1982 Lolita Morena were chosen from among several candidates considered by TSR.

Rehearsals for the participating artists began on 1 May 1989. Two technical rehearsals were conducted for each participating delegation in the week approaching the contest, with countries rehearsing in the order in which they would perform. The first rehearsals of 50 minutes were held on 1 and 2 May, followed by a press conference for each delegation and the accredited press.Each country&#x27;s second rehearsals were held on 3 and 4 May and lasted 35 minutes total. Three dress rehearsals were held with all artists, held in the afternoon and evening of 5 May and in the afternoon of 6 May; all dress rehearsals were held in front of an audience, although for the afternoon rehearsal on 5 May, the acts were not required to be in their performance costumes.

During the contest week each delegation also took part in recording sessions for the postcards, short films which served as an introduction to each country&#x27;s entry, as well as providing an opportunity for transition between entries and allow stage crew to make changes on stage. Footage for the postcards were filmed between 1 and 4 May for the delegations, with the exception of the Swiss delegation which filmed for their postcard in the weeks leading up to the contest; delegations recorded for their postcards on one of the days in which they were not required to be present at the contest venue. Delegations were also invited to a number of special events during the contest week: on 1 May a welcome reception was hosted by the Council of States of the canton of Vaud and the municipality of Lausanne in the ballroom of the ; on 2 May, Céline Dion performed her first show on Swiss soil as part of her Incognito Tour at the ; a dinner cruise on Lake Geneva was organised for 3 May; and a reception on 5 May was organsised by the tourist office of the canton of Grisons.

== Format ==
Each participating broadcaster submitted one song, which was required to be no longer than three minutes in duration and performed in the language, or one of the languages, of the country which it represented. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance. Each entry could utilise all or part of the live orchestra and could use instrumental-only backing tracks, however any backing tracks used could only include the sound of instruments featured on stage being mimed by the performers.

The results of the 1989 contest were determined through the same scoring system as had first been introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. The points awarded by each country were determined by an assembled jury of sixteen individuals, who were all required to be members of the public with no connection to the music industry, split evenly between men and women and by age. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing.

Partly due to the close result at the previous year&#x27;s event, the tie-break procedure, to determine a single winner should two or more countries finish in first place with the same number of points, was modified. For the 1989 event and for future contents, an analysis of the tied countries&#x27; top marks would be conducted, with the country that received the most 12-point scores being declared the winner. If a tie for first place remained then the country with the most 10 points would be crowned the winner. Should two or more countries still remain tied for first place after analysing both 12- and 10-point scores then the tying countries would be declared joint winners.

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 6 May 1989 at 21:00 (CEST) with a duration of 3 hours and 10 minutes and was presented by Jacques Deschenaux and Lolita Morena.

The contest opened with a seven minute film, directed by Jean-Marc Panchaud, highlighting modern Swiss landscapes and themes in juxtaposition with paintings by celebrated Swiss artists and starring Sylvie Aeschbach as Heidi. This was followed by performances in the contest venue by the reigning Eurovision winner Célion Dion, who performed both her winning song from the 1988 contest &quot;&quot; and the premiere of her first English language single &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot;. The interval act was the stunt artist Guy Tell; modelling himself after the Swiss folk hero William Tell, Guy Tell used high-powered crossbows to pierce various targets with precision at distance. The climax of the performance featured sixteen crossbows being positioned to set off a chain reaction in sequence, with the arrow from the first crossbow hitting a target which set off the next crossbow, culminating in an arrow piercing an apple set above the head of the performer. Ultimately however, on the night of the contest itself, the final arrow missed the apple slightly by a few centimetres. The trophy awarded to the winners was presented at the end of the broadcast by Céline Dion and Sylvie Aeschbach.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Rock Me&quot;, composed by Rajko Dujmić, written by Stevo Cvikić and performed by the band Riva. It was Yugoslavia&#x27;s first Eurovision win on their twenty-fourth contest appearance, becoming the seventeenth nation to win the contest. It would also prove to be the country&#x27;s only win, as the nation would begin to break into separate states two years later and would eventually participate for the last time in . It was the sixth time that the song which was performed last ended up winning the contest. The and placed second and third respectively for the second consecutive year, with the UK finishing in second place for the twelfth time in total. finished in the top five for the first time since , while achieved its best result since . achieved their worst result to date, and for the third consecutive year one of the participating countries failed to receive any points, on this occasion became the newest country to receive &quot;nul points&quot;, their worst result in four years of participation. During the traditional winner&#x27;s reprise performance, Riva sung the winning song entirely in English.

<text>The fieldfare (Turdus pilaris) is a member of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and across the Palearctic. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, and berries, grain and seeds in the winter.

Fieldfares often nest in small colonies, possibly for protection from predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often in the company of redwings.

The fieldfare is long, with a grey crown, neck and rump, a plain brown back, dark wings and tail and white underwings. The breast and flanks are heavily spotted. The breast has a reddish wash and the rest of the underparts are white. The sexes are similar in appearance but the females are slightly more brown. The male has a simple chattering song and the birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls.

==Taxonomy==
Nearly 90 species of medium to large thrushes are in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, characterised by rounded heads, longish, pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. Although two European thrushes, the song thrush and mistle thrush, are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes after they spread north from Africa, the fieldfare is descended from ancestors that had colonised the Caribbean islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.

The fieldfare was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name. Linnaeus specified the type locality as Europe but this was restricted to Sweden by the German orthithologist Ernst Hartert in 1910. The name &quot;Turdus pilaris&quot; comes from two separate Latin words for . No subspecies are recognised.

The English common name &quot;fieldfare&quot; dates back to at least the 11th century. The Old English word perhaps meant , but it has also been suggested it may derive from Old English , , related to an old Welsh name for the species with the same meaning.

==Description==
The fieldfare is easily recognisable with its slate-grey head, nape and rump, dark brown back, blackish tail and boldly speckled breast. In flight, its white under and are conspicuous. The harsh flight call &quot;tsak tsak&quot; is also distinctive.

The forehead and crown of the male are bluish-grey and each feather has a central brownish-black band. The lores and under-eye regions are black and there are faint, pale streaks above the eyes. The , nape, hind neck and rump are bluish-grey, usually with a white streak near the shaft of each rump feather. The and feathers are dark chestnut-brown with dark central streaks and pale tips. There are fourteen tail feathers each with a pointed tip, the outer two slightly shorter than the others giving a rounded tail. They are brownish-black, with inconspicuous darker bars visible in some lights. The outer edge of each tail feather is fringed with grey near the base and the outer pair of feathers have a narrow white border on the inner edge. The chin, throat and upper breast are creamy-buff with bold streaks and speckles of brownish-black. The lower breast is creamy-white with a diminishing buff tinge and fewer speckles and the belly is similarly creamy-white, with the speckles restricted to the uppermost parts. The primaries are brownish-black with the leading edge fringed grey and the inner edge of the outer feathers grey near the base whereas the inner feathers are fringed with brown near the base. The secondaries are similar but fringed with chestnut-brown on the leading edge. The upper wing-coverts are brownish-black and similar to the outer primaries in their margin colouration. The axillaries and under wing-coverts are white and the under tail-coverts have dark greyish-brown bases and margins and white centres and tips. The beak is strong, with a slight curve and a notch near the tip. It is orange-yellow in winter, with the upper mandible somewhat brownish and both mandible tips brownish-black. In the summer both mandibles of the male&#x27;s beak are yellow. The irises are dark brown and the legs and feet are brown. The average adult length is , the winglength is and the tarsal length . Wingspan ranges from 39 to 42 cm and weight ranges from 80 to 140 g.

The female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male&#x27;s winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.

The call is mostly uttered in flight and is a harsh &quot;tsak tsak tsuk&quot;. The same sound, but softer, is made more conversationally when individuals gather in trees. When angry or alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of the mistle thrush (&quot;Turdus viscivorus&quot;). The male has a rather feeble song that he sings in the breeding season. It is a mixture of a few phrases like those of the common blackbird (&quot;Turdus merula&quot;) interspersed with whistles, guttural squeaks and call notes. This is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The fieldfare is a migratory species with a palearctic distribution. It breeds in northern Norway, northern Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Siberia as far east as Transbaikal, the Aldan River and the Tian Shan Mountains in North West China. Its winter range extends through western and southern Europe to North Africa, though it is uncommon in the Mediterranean region. Eastern populations migrate to Anatolia, Lebanon, Iran and Northwest India, and occasionally Northeast India. It is a vagrant to Iceland, Greenland, Spitsbergen, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Madeira, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, the United States, Malta and Cyprus.

The flight of the fieldfare is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared in the winter and bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing every so often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.

=== Habitat ===
In the summer, the fieldfare frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid the vicinity of humans and can be seen in cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above the tree line. In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year, they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields.

=== Migration ===
Migration southwards from the breeding range starts in October but the bulk of birds arrive in the United Kingdom in November. Some of these are still on passage and carry on into continental Europe but others remain. The passage-migrants return in April and they and the resident migrants depart from the United Kingdom mostly by early May.

==Behaviour and ecology==
=== Food and feeding ===
The fieldfare is omnivorous. Animal food in the diet includes snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, dog rose, &quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, &quot;Pyracantha&quot; and &quot;Berberis&quot; are all relished. Later in the winter windfall apples are eaten, swedes attacked in the field and grain and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.

===Breeding===
The breeding season starts in May in Poland but further north in Scandinavia may not start until early July. The female fieldfare builds a cup-shaped nest with no attempt at concealment. The location is often in woodland but may be in a hedgerow, garden, among rocks, in a pile of logs, in a hut or on the ground. Fieldfares usually nest in close proximity to others of the same species. The adults will defend the nest aggressively and nesting gregariously may offer protection from predators. The nest is built of dried grasses and weeds with a few twigs and a little moss, with a lining of mud and an inner lining of fine grasses. There are usually five to six eggs in a clutch, but occasionally three, four, seven or eight eggs are laid. The eggs vary in size from and are variable in colour. Many are pale blue speckled with fine brown dots and resemble those of the common blackbird. Others are bright blue, with or without larger red-brown splotches. Incubation starts before all the eggs are laid and lasts for thirteen to fourteen days. The female does all or most of the incubation. The chicks are altricial and both parents bring food to them. They are usually ready to leave the nest after fourteen to sixteen days and there may be two broods in the season, especially in the southern parts of the breeding range.

==Status and conservation==
The fieldfare has an extensive range, estimated at 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million square miles), and a large population, including an estimated forty two to seventy two million individuals in Europe. There are thought to be up to twenty million individuals in Russia and the global population is estimated to be between forty-four and ninety-six million individuals. The population size appears to be stable and the bird is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, at the extreme edge of the fieldfare&#x27;s breeding range, only a handful of pairs breed. It is therefore classified by the RSPB as a Red List species as of January 2013.

Its first team plays in EFL League One, the third tier of English football, following relegation in 2024.

As Small Heath, they played in the Football Alliance before becoming founder members and first champions of the Football League Second Division. The most successful period in their history was in the 1950s and early 1960s. They achieved their highest finishing position of sixth in the First Division in the 1955–56 season and reached the 1956 FA Cup final. Birmingham played in two Inter-Cities Fairs Cup finals, in 1960, as the first English club side to reach a major European final, and again the following year. They won the League Cup in 1963 and again in 2011. Birmingham have played in the top tier of English football for around half of their history: the longest period spent outside the top division, between 1986 and 2002, included two brief spells in the third tier of English football, during which time they won the Football League Trophy twice.

St Andrew&#x27;s, renamed St. Andrew&#x27;s @ Knighthead Park in 2024 for sponsorship reasons, has been their home ground since 1906. They have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours, with whom they play the Second City derby. The club&#x27;s nickname is Blues, after the colour of their kit, and the fans are known as Bluenoses.

== History ==
===The early years (1875–1943)===

Birmingham City were founded as Small Heath Alliance in 1875, and from 1877 played their home games at Muntz Street. The club turned professional in 1885, and three years later became the first football club to become a limited company with a board of directors, under the name of Small Heath F.C. Ltd. From the 1889–90 season they played in the Football Alliance, which ran alongside the Football League. In 1892, Small Heath, along with the other Alliance teams, were invited to join the newly formed Football League Second Division. They finished as champions, but failed to win promotion via the test match system; the following season promotion to the First Division was secured after a second-place finish and test match victory over Darwen. The club adopted the name Birmingham Football Club in 1905, and moved into their new home, St Andrew&#x27;s Ground, the following year. Matters on the field failed to live up to their surroundings. Birmingham were relegated in 1908, obliged to apply for re-election two years later, and remained in the Second Division until after the First World War.

Frank Womack&#x27;s captaincy and the creativity of Scottish international playmaker Johnny Crosbie contributed much to Birmingham winning their second Division Two title in 1920–21. Womack went on to make 515 appearances, a club record for an outfielder, over a twenty-year career. 1920 also saw the debut of the 19-year-old Joe Bradford, who went on to score a club record 267 goals in 445 games, and won 12 caps for England. In 1931, manager Leslie Knighton led the club to their first FA Cup final, which they lost 2–1 to Second Division club West Bromwich Albion. Though Birmingham remained in the top flight for 18 seasons, they struggled in the league, with much reliance placed on England goalkeeper Harry Hibbs to make up for the lack of goals, Bradford excepted, at the other end. They were finally relegated in 1939, the last full season before the Football League was abandoned for the duration of the Second World War.

===Birmingham City: Post-war success (1943–1965)===
The name Birmingham City F.C. was adopted in 1943. Under Harry Storer, appointed manager in 1945, the club won the Football League South wartime league and reached the semi-final of the first post-war FA Cup. Two years later they won their third Second Division title, conceding only 24 goals in the 42-game season. Storer&#x27;s successor, Bob Brocklebank, though unable to stave off relegation in 1950, brought in players who made a major contribution to the club&#x27;s successes of the next decade. When Arthur Turner took over as manager in November 1954, he made them play closer to their potential, and a 5–1 win on the last day of the 1954–55 season confirmed them as champions. In their first season back in the First Division, Birmingham achieved their highest league finish of sixth place. They also reached the FA Cup final, losing 3–1 to Manchester City in the game notable for City&#x27;s goalkeeper Bert Trautmann playing the last 20 minutes with a broken bone in his neck. The following season the club lost in the FA Cup semi-final for the third time since the war, this time beaten 2–0 by Manchester United&#x27;s &quot;Busby Babes&quot;.

Birmingham became the first English club side to take part in European competition when they played their first group game in the inaugural Inter-Cities Fairs Cup competition on 15 May 1956; they went on to reach the semi-final, in which they drew 4–4 on aggregate with Barcelona but lost the replay 2–1. They were also the first English club side to reach a European final, losing 4–1 on aggregate to Barcelona in the 1960 Fairs Cup final and 4–2 to A.S. Roma the following year. In the 1961 semi-final they beat Internazionale home and away; no other English club won a competitive game in the San Siro until Arsenal managed it in 2003. Gil Merrick&#x27;s side saved their best form for cup competitions. Though opponents in the 1963 League Cup final, local rivals Aston Villa, were pre-match favourites, Birmingham raised their game and won 3–1 on aggregate to lift their first major trophy. In 1965, after ten years in the top flight, they returned to the Second Division.

===Investment, promotion and decline (1965–1993)===
Businessman Clifford Coombs took over as chairman in 1965, luring Stan Cullis out of retirement to manage the club. Cullis&#x27;s team played attractive football which took them to the semi-finals of the League Cup in 1967 and of the FA Cup in 1968, but league football needed a different approach. Successor Freddie Goodwin produced a team playing skilful, aggressive football that won promotion as well as reaching an FA Cup semi-final. Two years later, the club raised money by selling Bob Latchford to Everton for a British record fee of £350,000, but without his goals the team struggled. Sir Alf Ramsey briefly managed the club before Jim Smith took over in 1978. With relegation a certainty, the club sold Trevor Francis to Nottingham Forest, making him the first player transferred for a fee of £1 million; Francis had scored 133 goals in 329 appearances over his nine years at Birmingham.

Smith took Birmingham straight back to the First Division, but a poor start to the 1981–82 season saw him replaced by Ron Saunders, who had just resigned from league champions Aston Villa. Saunders&#x27; team struggled to score goals and were relegated in 1984. They bounced back up, but the last home game of the 1984–85 promotion season, against Leeds United, was marred by rioting, culminating in the death of a boy when a wall collapsed on him. This was on the same day as the Bradford City stadium fire, and the events at St Andrew&#x27;s formed part of the remit of Mr Justice Popplewell&#x27;s inquiry into safety at sports grounds. The club lacked stability both on and off the field. Saunders quit after FA Cup defeat to non-League team Altrincham, staff were laid off, the training ground was sold, and by 1989 Birmingham were in the Third Division for the first time in their history.

In April 1989 the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain, bought the club. A rapid turnover of managers, the absence of promised investment, and a threatened mass refusal of players to renew contracts was relieved only by a victorious trip to Wembley in the Associate Members&#x27; Cup. Terry Cooper delivered promotion, but the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars&#x27; businesses into receivership; in November 1992 BCCI&#x27;s liquidator put up for sale their 84% holding in the football club.

===Sale and reconstruction (1992–2007)===

The club continued in administration for four months, until Sport Newspapers&#x27; proprietor David Sullivan bought it for £700,000, installed the then 23-year-old Karren Brady as managing director and allowed Cooper money for signings. On the last day of the season, the team avoided relegation back to the third tier, but after a poor start to the 1993–94 season Cooper was replaced by Barry Fry. The change did not prevent relegation, but Fry&#x27;s first full season brought promotion back to the second tier as champions, and victory over Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy via Paul Tait&#x27;s golden goal completed the &quot;lower-league Double&quot;. After one more year, Fry was dismissed to make way for the return of Trevor Francis.

Reinforced by players with top-level experience, including Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, Francis&#x27;s team narrowly missed out on a play-off position in 1998, and three years of play-off semi-final defeats followed. They reached the 2001 League Cup final against Liverpool at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a penalty shoot-out which Liverpool won. By October 2001, lack of progress had made Francis&#x27;s position untenable; after a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent. Bruce&#x27;s return as manager shook up a stale team; he took them from mid-table to the play-offs, and beat Norwich City on penalties in the final to secure promotion to the Premier League.

Motivated by the inspirational Christophe Dugarry, Birmingham&#x27;s first top-flight season for 16 years finished in mid-table. Loan signing Mikael Forssell&#x27;s 17 league goals helped Birmingham to a top-half finish in 2003–04, but when he was injured, the 2004–05 team struggled for goals. In July 2005, chairman David Gold said it was time to &quot;start talking about being as good as anyone outside the top three or four&quot; with &quot;the best squad of players for 25 years&quot;. Injuries, loss of form, and lack of transfer window investment saw them relegated in a season whose lowlight was a 7–0 FA Cup defeat to Liverpool. Jermaine Pennant and Emile Heskey left for record fees, many others were released, but Bruce&#x27;s amended recruitment strategy, combining free-transfer experience with young &quot;hungry&quot; players and shrewd exploitation of the loan market, brought automatic promotion at the end of a season which had included calls for his head.

===The Chinese years (2007–2023)===
In July 2007, Hong Kong-based businessman Carson Yeung bought 29.9% of shares in the club, making him the biggest single shareholder, with a view to taking full control in the future. Uncertain as to his future under possible new owners, Bruce left in mid-season. His successor, Scotland national team manager Alex McLeish, was unable to stave off relegation, but achieved promotion back to the Premier League at the first attempt. Yeung&#x27;s company completed the takeover in 2009, and the team finished in ninth place, their highest for 51 years. In 2011, they combined a second League Cup, defeating favourites Arsenal 2–1 with goals from Nikola Žigić and Obafemi Martins and securing qualification for the Europa League, with relegation back to the second tier, after which McLeish resigned to join Aston Villa.

Birmingham narrowly failed to reach the knockout rounds of the Europa League and the play-off final. With the club in financial turmoil and under a transfer embargo, manager Chris Hughton left. Under Lee Clark, Birmingham twice retained their divisional status, albeit through Paul Caddis&#x27;s 93rd-minute goal in the last match of 2013–14 to avoid relegation on goal difference, but continued poor form saw him dismissed in October 2014. Gary Rowett stabilised the team and led them to two tenth-place finishes before being controversially dismissed by new owners Trillion Trophy Asia in favour of the &quot;pedigree&quot; of Gianfranco Zola, who would aid the club&#x27;s &quot;strategic, long-term view&quot; to take the club in a new direction.

Two wins from 24 matches under Zola left Birmingham needing two wins from the last three games to stay up, which they achieved under the managership of Harry Redknapp. Redknapp lasted another month, his former assistant Steve Cotterill five months, leaving successor Garry Monk anotherultimately successfulrelegation battle. Despite budgetary restrictions and a nine-point deduction for breaches of the League&#x27;s Profitability and Sustainability (P&amp;S) rules, the team finished 17th in 2018–19; however, Monk was sacked in June after conflict with the board. He was succeeded by his assistant, Pep Clotet, initially as caretaker. In the 2019–20 season, the club once again avoided relegation despite a 14-match winless run at the end of the season and the threat of a further points deduction. Academy product Jude Bellingham was sold to Borussia Dortmund in the summer for a club-record deal reported to be worth up to £30 million, after which Aitor Karanka lasted eight months as head coach before being replaced by former Birmingham player Lee Bowyer. After 16 months and yet another relegation struggle, amid rumours of an imminent takeover, Bowyer was replaced by John Eustace.

===American control (2023–present)===
After two takeover attempts fell through, Shelby Companies Ltd, a subsidiary of US-based Knighthead Capital Management and fronted by that company&#x27;s co-founder Tom Wagner, purchased a controlling stake in the club and full ownership of the stadium on 13 July 2023. Former Manchester City CEO Garry Cook was appointed to the corresponding role at Birmingham, and the club gained considerable publicity from the arrival of American football player Tom Brady as minority owner.

In early October, with the team in the play-off places, Eustace was sacked. In a move that echoed Rowett&#x27;s replacement by Zola seven years prior, the board stressed the need for &quot;a winning mentality and a culture of ambition&quot; across the club, and a new appointment with &quot;[responsibility] for creating an identity and clear &#x27;no fear&#x27; playing style&quot;. After former England international Wayne Rooney&#x27;s two wins from 15 matches left Birmingham in 20th place, Tony Mowbray was appointed manager. His need for medical leave brought the interim appointment of Gary Rowett, whose 11 points from the last eight games was not enough to prevent relegation to League One after 29 years at a higher level.

== Colours and badge ==
The Small Heath Alliance members decided among themselves that their colours would be blue; in the early days, they wore whatever blue shirt they had. The first uniform kit was a dark blue shirt with a white sash and white shorts. Several variations on a blue theme were tried; the one that stuck was the royal blue shirt with a white &quot;V&quot;, adopted during the First World War and retained until the late 1920s. Though the design changed, the royal blue remained. In 1971 they adopted the &quot;penguin&quot; striproyal blue with a broad white central front panelwhich lasted five years. Since then they have generally worn plain, nominally royal blue shirts, though the actual shade used has varied. Shorts have been either blue or white, and socks usually blue, white or a combination. White, yellow, red and black, on their own or in combination, have been the most frequently used colours for the away kit.

There were aberrations: the 1992 kit, sponsored by Triton Showers, was made of a blue material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. The home shirt has only once featured stripes: in 1999, the blue shirt had a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.

When the club changed its name from Small Heath to Birmingham in 1905 it adopted the city&#x27;s coat of arms as its badge, although this was not always worn on the shirts. The 1970s &quot;penguin&quot; shirt carried the letters &quot;BCFC&quot; intertwined at the centre of the chest. The &quot;Sports Argus&quot; newspaper ran a competition in 1972 to design a new badge for the club. The winning entry, a line-drawn globe and ball, with a ribbon carrying the club&#x27;s name and date of foundation, in plain blue and white, was adopted by the club but not worn on playing shirts until 1976, after the design was granted by the College of Arms in 1975. An experiment made in the early 1990s with colouring in the globe and ball was soon abandoned.

The club rarely spends more than three seasons with the same kit supplier. The first sponsor to have its name on the shirt was Birmingham-based brewery Ansells in 1983. They withdrew in mid-1985, and the shirts went unsponsored until January 1987, when Co-op Milk paid a &quot;five-figure sum&quot; to have its name displayed until the end of the season. That was a relief to the club not only financially: the vice-chairman claimed that as a &quot;big club ... people expect us to have a shirt sponsor and we have been lagging behind&quot;. Later sponsors included car retailer PJ Evans/Evans Halshaw (1988–1989), Mark One (1989–1992), Triton Showers (1992–1995), Auto Windscreens (1995–2001), Phones 4u (2001–2003), Flybe (2003–2007), F&amp;C Investments (2007–2011), foreign exchange company RationalFX (2011–2012), &quot;lifestyle and leisure&quot; business EZE Group (2012–2013 and 2015–2016), e-cigarette company Nicolites (2013–2014), mobile payment enabler Zapaygo (2014–2015), 888sport (2016–2019) and BoyleSports (2019–2023).

In June 2020, the club announced a four-year partnership with Nike as supplier of kits, upgraded during the 2023–24 season to include bespoke rather than off-the-shelf product. The 2024–25 home kit consists of a royal blue shirt with white trim andwith echoes of the Co-op Milk shirt of the 1980sa white strip across the front carrying the logo of the club&#x27;s principal partner, streetwear company Undefeated, white shorts and royal blue socks.

== Stadiums ==
Small Heath Alliance played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, Bordesley Green. As interest grew, they moved to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, where admission could be charged. A year later, they moved again, to a field adjoining Muntz Street, Small Heath, near the main Coventry Road, with a capacity of about 10,000. The Muntz Street ground was adequate for 1880s friendly matches, and the capacity was gradually raised to around 30,000, but when several thousand spectators scaled walls and broke down turnstiles to get into a First Division match against Aston Villa, it became clear that it could no longer cope with the demand.

Director Harry Morris identified a site for a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile (1 km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies are known to have camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.
The original capacity of St Andrew&#x27;s was reported as 75,000, with 4,000 seats in the Main Stand and space for 22,000 under cover. By 1938 the official capacity was 68,000, and February 1939 saw the attendance record set at the fifth round FA Cup tie against Everton, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. On the outbreak of the Second World War, the Chief Constable ordered the ground&#x27;s closure because of the danger from air raids; it was the only ground to be thus closed, and was only re-opened after the matter was raised in Parliament. It was badly damaged during the Birmingham Blitz: the Railway End and the Kop as a result of bombing, while the Main Stand burnt down when a fireman mistook petrol for water.
The replacement Main Stand used a propped cantilever roof design, which meant fewer pillars to block spectators&#x27; view of the pitch. Floodlights were installed in 1956, and officially switched on for a friendly match against Borussia Dortmund in 1957. By the early 1960s a stand had been built at the Railway End to the same design as the Main Stand, roofs had been put on the Kop and Tilton Road End, and the ground capacity was down to about 55,000.

Resulting from the 1986 Popplewell Report into the safety of sports grounds and the later Taylor Report, the capacity of St Andrew&#x27;s was set at 28,235 for safety reasons, but it was accepted that the stadium had to be brought up to modern all-seated standards. After the last home game of the 1993–94 season, the Kop and Tilton Road terraces were demolishedfans took home a significant proportion as souvenirsto be replaced at the start of the new season by a 7,000-seat Tilton Road Stand, continuing round the corner into the 9,500-seat Kop which opened two months later. The 8,000-seat Railway Stand followed in 1999; ten years later, this was renamed the Gil Merrick Stand, in honour of the club&#x27;s appearance record-holder and former manager, but the Main Stand has still to be modernised. In 2021, the club website listed the stadium capacity as 29,409.

In 2004 a proposal was put forward to build a &quot;sports village&quot; comprising a 55,000-capacity City of Birmingham Stadium, other sports and leisure facilities, and a super casino, to be jointly financed by Birmingham City Council, Birmingham City F.C. (via the proceeds of the sale of St Andrew&#x27;s) and the casino group Las Vegas Sands. The feasibility of the plan depended on the government issuing a licence for a super casino, and Birmingham being chosen as the venue, but this did not happen. The club have planning permission to redevelop the Main Stand, but club and council continued to seek alternative sources of funding for the City of Birmingham Stadium project.

In 2013, the Birmingham City Supporters&#x27; Trust&#x27;s application for listing St Andrew&#x27;s as an Asset of Community Value (ACV)a building or other land whose main use &quot;furthers the social wellbeing or social interests of the local community&quot; and where it is realistic to believe it could do so in the future.under the Localism Act 2011 was approved by Birmingham City Council. This requires any proposed sale to be notified to the council, and provides for a six-month moratorium on that sale to allow the Trust and other community groups to submit their own bid. In 2018, the club&#x27;s owners agreed a three-year sponsorship deal under which the name became St Andrew&#x27;s Trillion Trophy Stadium.

The lower tiers of the Tilton and Kop stands were closed for asbestos-related repairs for approaching three years, reopening fully in November 2023. In 2024, the stadium was renamed St. Andrew&#x27;s @ Knighthead Park for sponsorship reasons, as &quot;step one in [the owners&#x27;] plan to create a world-renowned &#x27;Sports Quarter&#x27; in Birmingham.&quot;

== Supporters ==
Birmingham fans consider their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, with whom they contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries include fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 Football Fans Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this was not always the case.
Birmingham&#x27;s supporters are generally referred to as &quot;Bluenoses&quot; in the media and by the fans themselves; the name is also used in a derogatory manner by fans of other clubs. A piece of public sculpture in the form of a ten-times-life-size head lying on a mound near the St Andrew&#x27;s ground, Ondré Nowakowski&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping Iron Giant&quot;, has been repeatedly defaced with blue paint on its nose. Between 1994 and 1997, the club mascot took the form of a blue nose, though it is now a dog named &quot;Beau Brummie&quot;, a play on the name Beau Brummell and Brummie, the slang word for a person from Birmingham.

A number of supporters&#x27; clubs are affiliated to the football club, both in England and abroad. An action group was formed in 1991 to protest against chairman Samesh Kumar, the club blamed an internet petition for the collapse of the purchase of player Lee Bowyer in 2005, and antipathy towards the board provoked hostile chanting and a pitch invasion after the last match of the 2007–08 season, but when the club was in financial difficulties, supporters contributed to schemes which funded the purchase of players Brian Roberts in 1984 and Paul Peschisolido in 1992. A supporters&#x27; trust was formed under the auspices of Supporters Direct in 2012.

There have been several fanzines published by supporters. &quot;Made in Brum&quot;, first issued in 2000, was the only one regularly on sale in 2013. The &quot;Zulu&quot; began some years earlier and ran for at least 16 seasons. The hooligan firm associated with the club, the Zulu Warriors, were unusual in that they had multi-racial membership at a time when many such firms had associations with racist or right-wing groups.

The fans&#x27; anthem, an adaptation of Harry Lauder&#x27;s &quot;Keep Right On To The End of the Road&quot;, was adopted during the 1956 FA Cup campaign. &quot;The Times&quot; football correspondent described in his Cup final preview how Player Alex Govan is credited with popularising the song, by singing it on the coach on the way to the quarter-final and when he revealed in an interview that it was his favourite.

== Ownership ==
Small Heath F.C. became a limited company in 1888; its first share issue was to the value of £650. The board was made up of local businessmen and dignitaries until 1965, when the club was sold to Clifford Coombs. By the mid-1980s the club was in financial trouble. Control passed from the Coombs family to former Walsall chairman Ken Wheldon, who cut costs, made redundancies, and sold off assets, including the club&#x27;s training ground. Still unable to make the club pay, Wheldon sold it to the Kumar brothers, owners of a clothing chain. Debt was still increasing when matters came to a head; the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) put the Kumars&#x27; businesses into receivership. The club continued in administration for four months until Sport Newspapers&#x27; proprietor David Sullivan bought the Kumars&#x27; 84% holding for £700,000 from BCCI&#x27;s liquidator in March 1993. Birmingham City plc, of which the football club was a wholly owned subsidiary, was floated on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in 1997 with an issue of 15 million new shares, raising £7.5 million of new investment. It made a pre-tax profit of £4.3M in the year ending 31 August 2008.

In July 2007, Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung, via the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (SEHK)-listed company Grandtop International Holdings Limited (GIH), bought 29.9% of the plc from its directors. Although his intention to take full control of the club initially came to nothing, GIH completed the purchase in October 2009 at a total cost of £81.5M, re-registered the club as a private company, and renamed the holding company Birmingham International Holdings (BIH).

Trading in BIH shares was suspended in June 2011 after Yeung&#x27;s arrest on charges of money-laundering. Publication of financial results was repeatedly delayed, which led the Football League to impose a transfer embargo, and offers for the club were entertained from 2012 onwards. After Yeung resigned his positions with both club and company in early 2014, share trading resumed, and following his conviction, efforts intensified to dispose of the club, which had to be done piecemeal in order to retain BIH&#x27;s share listing.

Going into 2015, the Football League made public their concerns over Yeung&#x27;s attempts to impose his choice of directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, as illustrated by the failure of three directors, including the club&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst &amp; Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no winding-up petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.

In June 2015, the receivers struck deals with the previous major shareholders such that legal action against them would be dropped in return for their agreement not to obstruct any transfer of ownership to their preferred bidder, the British Virgin Islands-registered investment vehicle Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA), wholly owned by Chinese businessman Paul Suen Cho Hung, who in turn agreed that the company would not be sold on within two years. The process completed in October 2016, leaving TTA owning 50.64% of BIH&#x27;s share capital, a level of ownership that required them to make an offer for the remainder.

To keep the company running, TTA arranged loans which it settled with discounted shares to the same value; the process of creating such shares diluted the percentage holding of all shareholders. Attempts to diversify the company&#x27;s holdings to make it less reliant on the football club were similarly funded. To reduce the club&#x27;s losses in light of breaches of the EFL&#x27;s Profitability and Sustainability Regulations, the stadium was sold for £22.8 million to Birmingham City Stadium Ltd, a new company wholly owned by the football club&#x27;s parent, and would be leased back to the club, In December 2020, 21.64% of the club and 25% of Birmingham City Stadium were sold to Vong Pech&#x27;s Oriental Rainbow, and in April 2021, the remaining 75% of the stadium was sold.

A June 2022 attempt to purchase the club by a group fronted by former Watford owner Laurence Bassini, involving financier Keith Harris and with money loaned by David Sullivan, came to nothing. A consortium led by fashion industry businessman Paul Richardson and Argentine former footballer Maxi López announced in July that they were close to completing the purchase of a stake in the club, and later confirmed that they were providing operating funds, but pulled out in December citing a failure to agree revisions to the original terms of agreement; in April 2023, Richardson, López and their proposed chief executive, former Charlton Athletic chairman Matt Southall, were sanctioned by the EFL after admitting breaching regulations by taking effective control of the club without approval.

In April 2023, Birmingham Sports Holdings confirmed letters of intent had been signed to sell 24% of Birmingham City plc shares held by themselves and the 21.64% owned by Oriental Rainbow, as well as the whole of Birmingham City Stadium Ltd, to a then unnamed potential purchaser, definitive agreements to be reached within a two-month exclusivity period. The purchaser was named as Shelby Companies Ltd, a subsidiary of asset management company Knighthead Capital Management fronted by Tom Wagner, Knighthead&#x27;s co-founder and co-CEO. The agreements were subject to approval by the English Football League (EFL), which was forthcoming in early June, and by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE), and an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on 13 July voted overwhelmingly to accept. Although BSH retain 51% of the shares, Wagner confirmed that Shelby were &quot;responsible for the operations of the club moving forward&quot; and that &quot;nothing about the way the transaction is structured will prevent us from obtaining the long-term goals we have for the club.&quot;

Small Heath first entered the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1878–79ten years before the foundation of the Football Leagueand won for the first time in 1905, defeating West Bromwich Albion 7–2 in the final. Its importance declined with the increase in League fixtures, and from the 1905–06 season onwards, Birmingham fielded teams containing reserve-team players.

* Football League South (wartime)
** Champions: 1945–46

Preparatory to the Football League resuming in 1946–47, the First and Second Division clubs from the last pre-war season were divided geographically between the Leagues North and South for 1945–46. Going into the last day of the season, Aston Villa were top of League South but had finished their programme two points (one win) ahead of the chasers but with a worse goal average. Charlton Athletic were second, above Birmingham by 0.002 of a goal. While Charlton could only draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham won away at Luton Town, so claimed the title by 0.3 of a goal.
== Records and statistics ==
Birmingham achieved their highest finishing position, of sixth in the top flight, in the 1955–56 First Division. Frank Womack holds the record for Birmingham league appearances, having played 491 matches between 1908 and 1928, closely followed by Gil Merrick with 485 between 1946 and 1959. If all senior competitions are included, Merrick has 551, less closely followed by Womack&#x27;s 515 which is the record for an outfield player. The player who won most international caps while at the club is Maik Taylor with 58 for Northern Ireland.

The goalscoring record is held by Joe Bradford, with 249 league goals, 267 altogether, scored between 1920 and 1935; no other player comes close. Walter Abbott holds the records for the most goals scored in a season, in 1898–99, with 34 league goals in the Second Division and 42 goals in total.

The club&#x27;s widest victory margin in the league was 12–0, a scoreline which they achieved once in the Football Alliance, against Nottingham Forest in 1899, and twice in the Second Division, against Walsall Town Swifts in 1892 and Doncaster Rovers in 1903. They have lost a league match by an eight-goal margin on eight occasions: twice in the Football Alliance and five times in the First Division, all away from home, and once at home, beaten 8–0 by AFC Bournemouth in the Championship in 2014. Their record FA Cup win was 10–0 against Druids in the fourth qualifying round of the 1899 competition; their record FA Cup defeat was 7–0 at home to Liverpool in the 2006 quarter-final.

Birmingham&#x27;s home attendance record was set at the fifth-round FA Cup tie against Everton on 11 February 1939. It is variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341. The highest transfer fee received for a Birmingham player is, according to the &quot;Sky Sports&quot; website, &quot;a guaranteed £25 million up front&quot; received in July 2020 from Borussia Dortmund for Jude Bellingham, which made him the most expensive 17-year-old in world football; the deal also included add-ons &quot;worth &#x27;several millions more&#x27;&quot;. The highest fee paid, for English forward Jay Stansfield, who joined from Fulham in August 2024 after a successful loan spell at Birmingham the previous season, is variously reported as an initial £10 m, £12 m or £15 m, plus bonuses and a sell-on clause.

===Retired numbers===
In appreciation of Jude Bellingham&#x27;s contribution in a short time with the first teamthe club&#x27;s youngest debutant, at 16 years and 38 days, and youngest goalscorer, he completed a full season in the Championship before becoming Birmingham&#x27;s record transfer and the world&#x27;s most expensive 17-year-old, &quot;showing what can be achieved through talent, hard work and dedication&quot; while retaining a &quot;caring, humble and engaging off-the-field demeanour&quot;the club retired his number 22 shirt &quot;to remember one of our own and to inspire others.&quot;

=== Birmingham City Women ===
Birmingham City Ladies Football Club was formed in 1968. The first team worked their way through the leagues until promoted to the FA Women&#x27;s Premier League in 2002. After Birmingham City F.C. withdrew financial support in 2005, the club were only able to continue because of a personal donation. They re-affiliated with Birmingham City in 2010, were founder members of the FA WSL the following year, and won the FA Women&#x27;s Cup in 2012. A second-place finish in the 2012 FA WSL earned them qualification for the 2013–14 Champions League, in which they reached the semi-final. After TTA took over Birmingham City F.C. in November 2016, the women&#x27;s club became an integral part of the organisation. It was formally renamed Birmingham City Women in 2018, and would be known as plain Birmingham City except where that would cause confusion with the men&#x27;s team.

Leslie Knighton took the club to the final of the FA Cup in 1931; Arthur Turner did likewise in 1956, as well as taking charge of the club&#x27;s highest league finish, sixth place in the 1955–56 First Division. Birmingham reached the 2001 Football League Cup Final under Trevor Francis, whose successor as permanent manager, Steve Bruce, twice achieved promotion to the Premier League. Birmingham won the League Cup for the second time under Alex McLeish in 2011. The 1966 World Cup-winning manager, Sir Alf Ramsey, took charge of the club briefly in 1977.

<text>The redwing (Turdus iliacus) is a bird in the thrush family, Turdidae, native to Europe and the Palearctic, slightly smaller than the related song thrush.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name.

The English name derives from the bird&#x27;s red underwing. It is not closely related to the red-winged blackbird, a North American species sometimes nicknamed &quot;redwing&quot;, which is an icterid, not a thrush. The binomial name derives from the Latin words &quot;turdus&quot;, &quot;thrush&quot;, and &quot;ile&quot; &quot;flank&quot;.

About 65 species of medium to large thrushes are in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, characterised by rounded heads, longish, pointed wings, and usually melodious songs. Although two European thrushes, the song thrush and mistle thrush, are early offshoots from the Eurasian lineage of &quot;Turdus&quot; thrushes after they spread north from Africa, the redwing is descended from ancestors that had colonised the Caribbean islands from Africa and subsequently reached Europe from there.

The redwing has two subspecies:
*&quot;T. i. iliacus&quot;, the nominate subspecies described by Linnaeus, which breeds in mainland Eurasia.
*&quot;T. i. coburni&quot; described by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1901, which breeds in Iceland and the Faroe Islands and winters from western Scotland and Ireland south to northern Spain. It is darker overall, and marginally larger than the nominate form.

==Description==
The thrush is 20–24 cm long with a wingspan of 33–34.5 cm and a weight of 50–75 g. The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and with dark brown spots on the white underparts. The most striking identification features are the red flanks and underwing, and the creamy white stripe above the eye. Adults moult between June and September, which means that some start to replace their flight feathers while still feeding young.

==Song==
The male has a varied short song, and a whistling flight call. Redwings show a distinct dialectic variation in song, having a considerable similarity in song patterns among birds within a local population.

The Redwing song consists of a number of introductory elements of descending or ascending frequency. These elements may be of pure tonal quality, or of a more harsh quality (varying degrees of frequency modulations or &quot;trills&quot;). After the introductory elements, a fast and more complex song pattern often follows. It is the introductory elements which show a geographic variation. The boundaries of any given dialect may vary but in a rural and forested environment in Norway the average size of these dialect areas is around 41.5 km2.
==Distribution and habitat==

The redwing thrush breeds in northern regions of Europe and the Palearctic, from Iceland south to northernmost Scotland, and east through Scandinavia, the Baltic States, northern Poland and Belarus, and through most of Russia to about 165°E in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. In recent years it has expanded its range slightly, both in eastern Europe where it now breeds south into northern Ukraine, and in southern Greenland, where the Qaqortoq area was colonised in 1990–1991.

It is often replaced by the related ring ouzel in areas of higher altitude.

The thrush is migratory, wintering in western, central and southern Europe, north-west Africa, and south-west Asia east to northern Iran. Birds in some parts of the west of the breeding range (particularly south-western Norway) may be resident, not migrating at all, while those in the far east of the range migrate at least 6,500–7,000 km to reach their wintering grounds.

There are multiple records of vagrants from the north-east coast of North America, as well as two sightings on the north-west coast (one in Washington in 2005, and one in Seward, Alaska in November 2011).

==Behaviour and ecology==
While migrating and wintering, redwing thrushes often form a loose flock. The size of the flock varies between 10 and at least 200 birds. They often feed together with fieldfares, common blackbirds and starlings. Sometimes, they will also feed alongside mistle thrushes, song thrushes, and ring ouzels. Unlike the song thrush, the more nomadic redwing does not tend to return regularly to the same wintering areas.

Migration occurs between autumn and early winter, and the birds often move at night. Oftentimes, they may make a &quot;Tseep&quot; contact call that can carry a long distance.

===Breeding===
The redwing thrush breeds in conifer and birch forests, and the tundra. Redwings nest in shrubs or on the ground, laying four to six eggs in a neat nest. The eggs are typically 2.6 x 1.9 centimetres in size and weigh 4.6 grammes, of which 5% is shell, and which hatch after 12–13 days. The chicks fledge 12–15 days after hatching, but the young remain dependent on their parents for another 14 days before they leave the nest.

===Feeding===
The thrush is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects and earthworms all year, supplemented by berries in autumn and winter, particularly of rowan &quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot; and hawthorn &quot;Crataegus monogyna&quot;.

===Natural threats===
A Russian study of blood parasites showed that many of the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;.

==Status and conservation==
The redwing has an extensive range, estimated at 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million square miles), and an estimated population of 26 to 40 million individuals in Europe alone. The European population forms approximately 40% of the global population, thus the very preliminary estimate of the global population is 98 to 151 million individuals. The species is believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore precautionarily uplisted to near threatened. Numbers can be adversely affected by severe winters, which may cause heavy mortality, and cold wet summers, which reduce breeding success.

<doc id="185202" wikidata="Q1903579" url="?curid=185202" title="Martin Carthy">
<text>Martin Dominic Forbes Carthy MBE (born 21 May 1941) is an English singer and guitarist who has remained one of the most influential figures in English folk music, inspiring contemporaries such as Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, as well as later artists such as Richard Thompson, since he emerged as a young musician in the early days of the folk revival in the UK during the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early life==
Carthy was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England, and grew up in Hampstead, North West London. His mother was an active socialist and his father, from a family of Thames lightermen, went to grammar school and became a trade unionist and a councillor for Stepney at the age of 21. Martin&#x27;s father had played fiddle and guitar as a young man but Martin was unaware of this connection to his folk music heritage until much later in life. His vocal and musical training began when he became a chorister at the Queen&#x27;s Chapel of The Savoy. 

He picked up his father&#x27;s old guitar for the first time after hearing &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; by Lonnie Donegan. He has cited his first major folk music influences as Big Bill Broonzy and the syncopated guitar style of Elizabeth Cotten. Carthy performed his first professional engagement at the age of 16 at The Loft, a coffee bar in Primrose Gardens. Although his father wanted him to go to university to study classics, Carthy left school at 17 and worked behind the scenes as a prompter at the open-air theatre in Regent&#x27;s Park, then as an assistant stage manager (ASM) on a tour of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, and then at Theatre in the Round in Scarborough. He became a resident at The Troubadour folk club in Earls Court in the early 1960s after his friend Robin Hall persuaded him to visit and listen to the piper Seamus Ennis. Carthy joined Redd Sullivan&#x27;s Thameside Four in 1961 as a skiffle guitarist and singer.

In the early 1960s, Carthy visited Ewan MacColl&#x27;s Ballads &amp; Blues club to watch a friend, the singer Roy Guest. The main performer that night was Sam Larner. Carthy has since described how Larner&#x27;s performance of &quot;Lofty Tall Ship&quot; altered his perception of how a traditional folk song could be sung, and how it was a key moment in his own development as an artist.

When American singer Bob Dylan arrived in London for the first time in 1962 to perform in &quot;Madhouse on Castle Street&quot;, he visited Martin Carthy at The Troubadour, The King &amp; Queen, and The Singers Club. He learned the traditional song &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; from Carthy, which he later developed into his own song &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot;.

==Musical career==

Carthy is a mostly solo performer of traditional songs in a very distinctive style, accompanying himself on his Martin 000-18 acoustic guitar; his style is marked by the use of alternative tunings (notably CGCDGA), and a strongly percussive picking style that emphasises the melody.

In 1964, Carthy joined Marian Mackenzie, Ralph Trainer and Leon Rosselson in the group The Three City Four. The group concentrated on contemporary songs, including some of Rosselson&#x27;s own, and made two albums – the first for Decca and a second, &quot;Smoke and Dust (Where the Heart Should Have Been)&quot;, for CBS. The 1965 eponymous debut &quot;The Three City Four&quot; featured Carthy singing lead vocals on two tracks – Sydney Carter&#x27;s &quot;Telephone Song&quot; and Rosselson&#x27;s own &quot;History Lesson&quot;. Roy Bailey would replace Carthy when he later left the group.

Carthy&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Martin Carthy&quot;, was released in 1965, and also featured Dave Swarbrick playing fiddle on some tracks, although he was not mentioned in the album&#x27;s sleeve notes. Carthy&#x27;s arrangement of the traditional ballad &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; was adapted, without acknowledgement, by Paul Simon on the Simon and Garfunkel album recording &quot;Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme&quot; in 1966. This caused a rift between the pair which was not resolved until Simon invited Carthy to sing the song with him on-stage at the Hammersmith Apollo in 2000.

==Musical collaborations==
He has also been involved with many musical collaborations. He has sung with The Watersons since 1972; was twice a member of British folk rock group Steeleye Span; was a member of the Albion Country Band 1973 line-up, with members from the Fairport Convention family and John Kirkpatrick, that recorded the &quot;Battle of the Field&quot; album; and was part of the innovative Brass Monkey ensemble, which mixed a range of brass instruments with Carthy&#x27;s guitar and mandolin and John Kirkpatrick&#x27;s accordion, melodeon and concertina. Carthy was also a member of The Imagined Village for all three of their albums (2007–2012).

For many years Carthy enjoyed a creative partnership with fiddle player Dave Swarbrick; more recently, has provided the forum for his successful musical partnership with wife Norma Waterson and their daughter Eliza Carthy.

Carthy has inspired contemporaries such as Bob Dylan and Paul Simon, as well as later artists such as Richard Thompson.

==Personal life==
Carthy has lived for many years in Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, North Yorkshire.

==Awards and honours==
In June 1998 he was appointed an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He was named Folk Singer of the Year at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2002, and again in 2005 when he also won the award for Best Traditional Track for &quot;The Famous Flower of Serving-Men&quot;. In the 2007 Folk Awards Martin Carthy and Dave Swarbrick won Best Duo. In 2008 he was made an Honorary Fellow of the University of Central Lancashire. In 2014 he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards.

<text>The scaly thrush (Zoothera dauma) is a member of the thrush family Turdidae.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in wet coniferous taiga, mainly in the Himalayas through Malaysia.

==Description==
The sexes are similar, 27–31 cm long, with black scaling on a paler white or yellowish background. The most striking identification feature in flight is the black band on the white underwings, a feature shared with Siberian thrush. The male has a song which is a loud, far-carrying mechanical whistle, with 5-10 second pauses between each one second long phrase &quot;twee...tuuu...tuuu...tuuu&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
There are several races which are now often split into a varying number of separate species. &quot;Z. aurea&quot; (White&#x27;s thrush), including the questionable subspecies &quot;Z. a. toratugumi&quot;, is the migratory Siberian and north-east Asian form. &quot;Z. neilgherriensis&quot; (Nilgiri thrush) is resident in the hills of southwest India. &quot;Z. imbricata&quot; (Sri Lanka thrush) is endemic to the hills of Sri Lanka and is particularly distinctive, being smaller, long-billed and rufous below. &quot;Z. d. dauma&quot; (scaly thrush) breeds in the Himalaya and migrates to the foothills in winter. &quot;Z. d. horsfieldi&quot; (Horsfield&#x27;s thrush) is resident in Indonesia on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok and Sumbawa. &quot;Z. major&quot; (Amami thrush) is restricted to the Amami Islands in Japan and is now considered a distinct species.

The taxonomy of this group is still in flux. Some of these subspecies are very similar and the identity of some populations, such as those on Taiwan, is uncertain.

The fawn-breasted thrush (&quot;Z. machiki&quot;) of Indonesia and the Bassian thrush (&quot;Z. lunulata&quot;) and russet-tailed thrush (&quot;Z. heinei&quot;) of Australia were also included in &quot;Z. dauma&quot; in the past.

==Behaviour==
The scaly thrush is very secretive, preferring dense cover. It nests in trees, laying three or four dull green eggs in a neat cup nest. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms and berries.

<text>C.F. Martin &amp; Company (often referred to as Martin) is an American guitar manufacturer established in 1833 by Christian Frederick Martin. It is highly respected for its acoustic guitars and is a leading manufacturer of flat top guitars and ukuleles. The company has also made mandolins and tiples, as well as several models of electric guitars and electric basses, although none of these other instruments are still in production.

The company&#x27;s headquarters and primary factory are situated in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, located in the Lehigh Valley region of the state. The original factory on North Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2018. This building no longer houses manufacturing, instead a luthier store called Guitar Maker&#x27;s Connection. The current headquarters on Sycamore Street includes the Martin Guitar Museum, which features over 170 guitars made by the company over its history. Visitors can see pictures of famous guitar owners, try out and purchase guitars, or take a factory tour.

The range of instruments manufactured by Martin include steel-string and classical acoustic guitars and ukuleles. The company also manufactures instruments and strings in Navojoa, Mexico. It produces approximately 193 guitars per day.

== Company history ==
The company has been run by the Martin family throughout its history. Its executive chairman, C.F. &#x27;Chris&#x27; Martin IV, is the great-great-great-grandson of the founder. The firm was the first to introduce many of the characteristic features of the modern flattop, steel-string acoustic guitar. Influential Martin innovations include the Dreadnought body style and scalloped bracing.

In June 2021, CFM IV retired as CEO. He still maintains a seat on the Board as Executive Chairman. The first non-family member, Thomas Ripsam, has since assumed the role of CEO. 

==Founding==

C. F. Martin was born in 1796 in Markneukirchen, a small town in Germany historically famous for building musical instruments. He came from a long line of cabinet makers and woodworkers. His father, Johann Georg Martin, also built guitars. By the age of 15, according to the book &quot;Martin Guitars: A History&quot; by Mike Longworth, C. F. Martin apprenticed to Johann Georg Stauffer, a well-known guitar maker in Vienna, Austria. Martin returned to his hometown after completing training and opened his own guitar-making shop. However, he soon became embroiled in a controversy between two guilds.

In the early 1800s, European craftsmen still operated under the guild system. The guitar (in its modern form) was a relatively new instrument, and most guitar makers were members of the Cabinet Makers&#x27; Guild. However, the Violin Makers&#x27; Guild claimed exclusive rights to manufacture musical instruments. The Violin Makers&#x27; Guild filed appeals on three occasions—the first in 1806—to prevent cabinet makers from producing guitars. Johann Martin is mentioned in a surviving submission dated 1832.

Although the cabinet makers successfully defended their right to build guitars, C. F. Martin believed that the guild system was too restrictive and moved to New York City in 1833. By 1838, he moved his business to Nazareth, Pennsylvania.

==Company==

The Martin company is generally credited with developing the X-bracing system during the 1850s (possibly July 1842) although C. F. Martin did not apply for a patent on the new bracing system. During the 1850s, X-bracing was used by several makers, all of whom were German immigrants who were known to each other, and according to historian Philip Gura there is no evidence that C. F. Martin invented the system. The Martin company was the first to use X-bracing on a large scale, however.

From the 1860s on, fan bracing became standard in Europe. Martin and other American builders including Washburn and others since forgotten (Schmidt &amp; Maul, Stumcke, Tilton) used X-bracing instead. While some consider the sound of X-bracing less delicate sounding in guitars strung with gut strings, this bracing method helped prepare the American guitar for steel strings, which emerged in the first quarter of the 20th century. Martin&#x27;s tinkering did not stop at X-bracing. From his cabinet-making heritage, he carried over the dovetail joint to connect the neck of the guitar to its body. Some feel that this new technique contributed to the propagation of tone transmission from the guitar neck into the body.

The growing popularity of the guitar in the early 1900s led to a demand for louder and more percussive guitars. In response, many companies began to use metal strings instead of the traditional catgut. These became known as steel-string guitars. By 1921, Martin had focused production towards steel-string guitars.

The company&#x27;s reputation and output continued to grow. Forays into mandolin making in the late 1890s and ukulele making in the 1920s greatly contributed to their expansion, and by 1928 they were making over 5,000 instruments per year. The ukulele was responsible for keeping the company profitable in the 1920s. The company remained family-owned and employed a relatively small number of highly trained craftsmen making instruments primarily by hand. By the early 1960s Martin guitars were back-ordered by as much as three years due to limited production capacity. In 1964, Martin opened a new plant that is still the primary Martin production facility.

One of the consistent policies of the company was to not engage in endorsement deals. At the same time, they offered a 20% discount as a courtesy to professional musicians. They would also offer to customize instruments with inlays of names for the performers.

==History==
===The Great Depression===

The Great Depression in 1929 drastically affected Martin&#x27;s sales. The company came up with two innovations to help regain business.

====14 fret orchestra model====

One of these was the 14-fret neck, which allowed easier access to higher notes. Most guitars of the day, with the exception of Gibson&#x27;s L-5 archtop jazz guitars, had necks joined at the 12th fret, half the scale length of the string. Martin intended it to appeal to plectrum banjo players interested in switching to guitar for increased work opportunities. This was in response to specific requests from tenor players including Al Esposito, the manager of the Carl Fischer store in New York City. The &quot;Carl Fischer Model&quot; tenors were soon renamed 0-18T. Martin altered the shape of its 0-size guitar body to accommodate 14 frets, the first time Martin changed one of their original body shapes to accommodate a longer neck with more frets clear of the body.

It was also during this time that Perry Bechtel, a well-known banjo player and guitar teacher from Cable Piano in Atlanta, requested that Martin build a guitar with a 15-fret neck-to-body join. In keeping with Bechtel&#x27;s request, Martin modified the shape of their 12-fret 000-size instrument, lowering the waist and giving the upper bout more acute curves to cause the neck joint to fall at the 14th fret rather than the 12th. Fourteen-fret guitars were designed to play with a pick and replace banjos in jazz orchestras. Thus Martin named its first 14-fret, 000-shape guitar the Orchestra Model (OM). Martin applied this term to all 14-fret instruments in its catalogs by the mid- to late-1930s.
Original Martin OMs from approximately 1929 to 1931 are extremely rare and sell for high prices. Many guitarists believe that the OM—a combination of Martin&#x27;s modified 14-fret 000 body shape, long scale (25.4&quot;) neck, solid headstock, 1-3/4&quot; nut width, 4-1/8&quot; maximum depth at the endwedge, and 2-3/8&quot; string spread at the bridge—offers the most versatile combination of features available in a steel-string acoustic guitar. Many contemporary guitar makers (including many small shops and hand-builders) design instruments on the OM pattern.

The change in body shape and longer neck became so popular that Martin made the 14-fret neck standard on almost all of its guitars and the rest of the guitar industry soon followed. Classical guitars, which were evolving on their own track largely among European builders, retained the 12-fret neck design.

====Dreadnought====
Martin&#x27;s second major innovation of the period 1915–1930 was the dreadnought guitar. Originally devised in 1916 as a collaboration between Martin and a prominent retailer, the Oliver Ditson Co., the dreadnought body style was larger and deeper than most guitars. In 1906, the Royal Navy launched a battleship that was considerably larger than any before it. From the idea that a ship that big had nothing to fear (nought to dread), it was christened . Martin borrowed this name for their new, large guitar. The greater volume and louder bass produced by this expansion in size was intended to make the guitar more useful as an accompaniment instrument for singers working with the limited sound equipment of the day. Initial models produced for Ditson were fan-braced, and the instruments were poorly received.
In 1931, Martin reintroduced the dreadnought with X-bracing and two years later gave it a modified body shape to accommodate a 14-fret neck, and it quickly became their bestselling guitar. The rest of the industry soon followed, and the &quot;dreadnought&quot; size and shape became one of the &quot;standard&quot; acoustic guitar shapes, iconic for its use in a wide variety of musical genres.

====Archtop====
Martin also developed a line of archtop instruments during the 1930s. Their design differed from Gibson and other archtops in a variety of respects–the fingerboard was glued to the top, rather than a floating extension of the neck, and the backs and sides were flat rosewood plates pressed into an arch rather than the more common carved figured maple. Martin archtops were not commercially successful and were withdrawn after several years. In spite of this, during the 1960s, David Bromberg had a Martin F-7 archtop converted to a flat-top guitar with exceptionally successful results, and as a result, Martin has issued a David Bromberg model based on this conversion (no longer in production). This and other conversions of Martin F-size guitars later became the basis for the Martin &quot;M&quot;-sized guitars (also known as the 0000 size). The original production models of this size in the 1970s were the M-36 and the M-38. After a hiatus, the M-36 is once again in regular production.

During this time, Martin also continued to make ukuleles, tiples, and mandolins.

===The 1960s===
During the late 1960s, Martin manufactured hollow-body electric guitars similar to those manufactured by Gretsch. Martin&#x27;s electric guitars were not popular and the company has since produced only acoustics. They also reinstated the famous D-45 in 1968.

During the 1960s, many musicians, including Clarence White and Eric Thompson preferred Martin guitars built before World War II to more recent guitars of the same model. The prewar guitars had a different internal bracing pattern consisting of scalloped braces (the later ones were tapered rather than scalloped), with the x-brace forward-shifted to about an inch of the soundhole, producing better resonance, and tops made from Adirondack red spruce rather than Sitka spruce. After 1969, the rosewood components, including the backs and sides of some models, were changed from Brazilian rosewood to Indian rosewood, due to restrictions on the sale of Brazilian rosewood. The D-28s and D-35s (introduced in the mid-1960s to make use of the more narrow pieces of wood, by using a three-piece back design) are now very sought-after on the vintage guitar market, fetching sums in the neighborhood of $50,000–$60,000. The same models from the early 1970s, with Indian Rosewood backs and sides, generally sell for less than $2,500.

Martin domestically produced hollow-body electric guitars in the mid-&#x27;60s, the GT-70, and GT-75. About 700 of each were produced. The guitars looked like a cross between Gretsch and Guild hollow-body guitars. The guitars have a typical 60&#x27;s jangly sound. DeArmond pickups were used. The units had Kluson tuners and most had a machined aluminum bridge though some were made with wooden bridges. Single and double-cutaway models were produced. Black, red and burgundy colors were available. The guitars failed to make a significant cultural or commercial impact.

=== Stinger Guitars ===

From 1985 to 1996 Martin produced a line of solid body electric guitars and basses under the brand name Stinger. These were modeled after Fender guitars and were made in Korea. The guitars were shipped to the Martin factory where they were inspected and given a final setup before being sent on to the distributors.

===Recent events===

Martin opened its &quot;Custom Shop&quot; division in 1979. Martin built its 500,000th guitar in 1990, and in 2004 they built their millionth guitar. This guitar is entirely hand-crafted and features more than 40 inlaid rubies and diamonds. It is worth an estimated $1 million. As of 2007, Martin employed 600 people.

In October 2009, a Martin D-28 that was played by Elvis Presley in his last concert was purchased at auction for $106,200.

In an effort to attract customers from the growing mid-level guitar market Martin introduced their first guitar constructed with laminated wood in 1993 with the D1 series that had laminated wood sides and a solid wood back. Since then they have also introduced an even less expensive DX series using printable HPL (high pressure laminates) as well as laminated &quot;durabond&quot; necks and yet maintain high tonal quality, built at their own factory in Mexico.

In January 2018, Martin announced it would release a D-45 John Mayer signature model. The model was unveiled on the winter NAMM Show.

In support of the imprisoned Kurdish singer Nûdem Durak, Roger Waters sent her his black Martin guitar he had played during the Us + Them Tour.

On June 21, 2020, the 1959 Martin D-18 E, modified to be plugged into an amplifier and played by Kurt Cobain during Nirvana&#x27;s 1993 &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; appearance, sold at auction for $6,010,000 a record sale price for any guitar.

On August 1, 2020, a D-18 owned and used by Elvis Presley from December 1954 to May 1955, sold at an auction by Gottahaverockandroll for US$1,320,000, the highest price ever paid for a non modified acoustic guitar.

===Martin ambassador===
In 2018 Martin hired Greg Koch as a Martin guitar ambassador. Koch now does clinics demonstrating Martin guitar models.

<doc id="185207" wikidata="Q258964" url="?curid=185207" title="Siberian thrush">
<text>The Siberian thrush (Geokichla sibirica) is a member of the thrush family, Turdidae. The genus name &quot;Geokichla&quot; comes from Ancient Greek &quot;geo-&quot;, &quot;ground-&quot; and &quot;kikhle&quot;, &quot; thrush&quot;. The specific &quot;sibirica&quot; is Latin for Siberia.

It breeds in taiga in Siberia. It is strongly migratory, with most birds moving to southeastern Asia during the winter. It is a very rare vagrant to western Europe. It is very secretive.

The Siberian thrush is similar in size to the song thrush. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms and berries.

The male Siberian thrush is a dark blue-grey above and below, with a white stripe above the eye. The lower belly and flanks are white. The female is a much browner bird, with a buff stripe above the eye.

A striking identification feature of both sexes in flight is the black band on the white underwings, a feature shared with the scaly thrush.

<doc id="185210" wikidata="Q711515" url="?curid=185210" title="Ralph McTell">
<text>Ralph McTell (born Ralph May; 3 December 1944) is an English singer-songwriter and guitar player who has been an influential figure on the UK folk music scene since the 1960s. McTell is best known for his song &quot;Streets of London&quot; (1969), which has been covered by over two hundred artists around the world. 

McTell modelled his guitar style on American country blues guitar players of the early 20th century, including Blind Blake, Robert Johnson and Blind Willie McTell. These influences led a friend to suggest his professional surname. An accomplished performer on piano and harmonica as well as guitar, McTell issued his first album in 1968 and found acclaim on the folk circuit. He reached his greatest commercial success in 1974 when a new recording of &quot;Streets of London&quot; became a No. 2 hit on the UK Singles Chart. 

Another of his notable compositions is &quot;From Clare to Here&quot;, a ballad about Irish emigration. In the 1980s, he wrote and played songs for two TV children&#x27;s programmes, &quot;Alphabet Zoo&quot;, which also featured Nerys Hughes, followed by &quot;Tickle on the Tum&quot;, featuring Jaqui Reddin. He also recorded Keith Hopwood&#x27;s and Malcolm Rowe&#x27;s theme song to Cosgrove Hall&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;.

==Biography==
McTell&#x27;s mother, Winifred (née Moss), was born in Hammersmith, London. During the Second World War she was living in Banbury, Oxfordshire, with her sister Olive when she met Frank May. They married in 1943 while Frank was home on leave from the army. Winifred moved to Croydon, Surrey, and McTell was born on 3 December 1944 in Farnborough, Kent. He was named after Ralph Vaughan Williams – Frank had worked as the composer&#x27;s gardener before the war. A second son, Bruce, was born in 1946. Frank was demobilised, but after a year or so at home, he walked out on his family in 1947.

Winifred was left to support herself and bring up the boys unaided. She told McTell&#x27;s biographer, &quot;I remember Ralph saying to me quite soon after Frank left us, &#x27;I&#x27;ll look after you, Mummy&#x27;. I guess he&#x27;d got used to Frank being away all his short life.&quot; But despite their father&#x27;s desertion and the consequent poverty, Ralph and Bruce May had a happy and fulfilled childhood in Croydon.

McTell&#x27;s love of music surfaced early. He was given a plastic mouth organ and his grandfather, who played the harmonica, taught and encouraged him. The brothers spent many contented summer holidays at Banbury with their uncle and aunt and their grandparents. Banbury and north Oxfordshire figured throughout McTell&#x27;s life. Later, he recalled those childhood summers in his song &quot;Barges&quot;.

===Influences===
Other childhood experiences shaped McTell&#x27;s songwriting. A young Irishman and his family were the Mays&#x27; upstairs neighbours. Needing a father figure, McTell greatly valued the young man&#x27;s friendship, which later inspired the song &quot;Mr. Connaughton&quot;. Similarly, &quot;Mrs Adlam&#x27;s Angels&quot; recalls his Sunday school teacher: &quot;I loved the ceremonial and the music,&quot; he says, &quot;you can hear the influence of hymn tunes in my song structures.&quot;

In 1952, two youths attempted to break into a Croydon warehouse: one, Derek Bentley, surrendered to the police but the other, sixteen-year-old Christopher Craig, shot and killed a police officer. Yet at the trial, Bentley was sentenced to death. &quot;My mum knew the Bentleys,&quot; McTell recalls. &quot;I was about eight, but even then I could see the horror and injustice of executing a teenager for a murder he didn&#x27;t commit.&quot; Many years later, McTell expressed that sense of injustice in the song &quot;Bentley &amp; Craig&quot;.

===Teens===
After passing his 11-plus school examination, McTell attended the John Ruskin Grammar School. He hated his time there, and despite being a very bright pupil, he did not do well academically. Many of his fellow pupils were from wealthier backgrounds, and though having many school friends, he felt he didn&#x27;t fit in.

Musically, his tastes tended towards being an outsider as well. He was captivated by skiffle and American rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll. Acquiring an old ukulele and a copy of &quot;The George Formby Method&quot;, he played his first chord. He later recalled, &quot;I was thunderstruck – it was like magic!&quot; Soon, he mastered skiffle classics such as &quot;Don&#x27;t You Rock Me, Daddy-O&quot;, and by his second year at school, he formed a skiffle band.

By the age of 15, McTell was very anxious to leave grammar school and the British Army looked like a way out, so in 1959 he enlisted in the Junior Leaders Battalion of The Queen&#x27;s Surrey Regiment. Army life proved far worse than school. After six months, he bought himself out and resumed his education at technical college, passing several O level exams and an A level exam in art.

In 1963, McTell was working on a building site, and it is of this time that he wrote, in the mid-1970s, &quot;From Clare to Here&quot;. &quot;There was an Irish gang on the site, and the &quot;craic&quot;, as they call it, relieved the stress of the hard work. I was working with an Irishman called Michael, as so many of them are. And I said to him, &#x27;It must be very strange to be here in London after the place you come from.&#x27; And he responded by saying, &#x27;Yes, it&#x27;s a long way from Clare to here.&#x27;&quot;

===Discovering African American music===
At college, McTell became interested in the beatnik culture that flourished in the 1950s and early 1960s. Besides reading the works of writers such as Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, he discovered African American music – jazz, blues and R&amp;B. Inspired by musicians such as Jesse Fuller, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters, he bought a guitar and practiced assiduously.

He and a group of like-minded friends became habitués of London&#x27;s Soho jazz clubs and regularly went down to Brighton to &quot;...sit on the beach looking windswept and interesting,&quot; as McTell put it. Soon he was spending much of his time away from Croydon, supporting himself with temporary work in factories, laundries and hotels.

During his travels, McTell met musicians who were destined to remain lifelong friends, among them Jacqui McShee (later to gain fame in the band Pentangle), Martin Carthy and Wizz Jones. He was persuaded to join a bluegrass-influenced band called the Hickory Nuts, who performed all over England and, despite playing in some dire places for pin money early on, ended up with decent fees and respectable crowds in venues such as Croydon&#x27;s Fairfield Halls.

===Busking===

By now, McTell had begun travelling abroad, busking around Europe with his guitar. He spent time in France and visited Belgium and Germany. Other trips took him to Italy and through Yugoslavia (&quot;I felt a madness there, even then&quot;) to Greece.

Paris was a city that McTell revisited frequently. Late in 1965 he and a friend from Croydon took a room in a cheap hotel on the Left Bank, earning their rent by busking cinema queues. After braving a bitterly cold Paris winter, McTell met a young American, Gary Petersen, who had studied with the guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. &quot;There was a great anticipation every time I got to play with (Petersen)&quot;, McTell recalled. &quot;Each time I learned something new, and through him I learned how to play ragtime properly.&quot;

In 1966, McTell met another émigré to Paris, a student from Norway named Nanna Stein. The pair soon became inseparable. Back in England, they lived in a caravan in Cornwall. McTell and Wizz Jones were regular performers on the Cornish circuit, especially at The Folk Cottage in Mitchell. It was Jones who suggested the stage name &quot;McTell&quot;, &quot;after Blind Willie McTell, whose &#x27;Statesboro Blues&#x27; we both loved&quot;.

Cornwall captured McTell&#x27;s heart – a place whose &quot;unique spirit got to me&quot; – and the county has always remained a place for him to retreat to. By the end of 1966, he and Stein were expecting their first child. They married on 30 November in Norway and returned to live in Croydon with Winifred. Their son, Sam, was born on 21 January 1967.

After an unrewarding spell at teacher training college, McTell decided he had to try to make it full-time in music. As well as his vocal and instrumental talents, he was developing as a songwriter and was in demand in folk clubs and festivals.

===Record deal===
During 1967, McTell landed a deal with Transatlantic Records and by the end of the year was recording his first album. Arranged by Tony Visconti and produced by Gus Dudgeon, the album, &quot;Eight Frames a Second&quot;, was released early in 1968. It came to the attention of the BBC and was featured on radio programmes including &quot;Country Meets Folk&quot; in August and John Peel&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot;. The release of the album meant more live work so McTell&#x27;s brother Bruce became his manager and booking agent.

His second album &quot;Spiral Staircase&quot;, recorded for Transatlantic in late 1968, included the first recording of &quot;Streets of London&quot;, which was recorded in one take by McTell on guitar and vocals.

The third album, &quot;My Side of Your Window&quot;, released in 1969, became Melody Maker magazine&#x27;s Folk Album of the Month. In July, McTell had appeared at Cambridge Folk Festival for the first time and at the end of the year headlined at Hornsey Town Hall.

===Into the 1970s===
By 1970, &quot;I&#x27;d got a family,&quot; McTell recalled in an interview, &quot;and found I had a musical career, somehow.&quot; He was getting extensive radio play, and the audiences at his concerts were growing.

By May, he was sufficiently successful to fill the Royal Festival Hall in London. In August, McTell played the huge Isle of Wight Festival alongside Jimi Hendrix, Joan Baez, and Leonard Cohen.

Bruce May had bowed out and McTell was now being managed by impresario Jo Lustig. In October 1970, McTell sold out the Royal Festival Hall again and the album &quot;Revisited&quot; was released. This remixed compilation was originally intended to introduce McTell to American record-buyers but was released in the UK. It has still not been released on cd, even though all the other Transatlantic albums have been remastered.

Ralph and Nanna&#x27;s daughter Leah was born on 9 February 1971.

&quot;You Well-Meaning Brought Me Here&quot; was released on the Famous label in 1971. Among the highlights of this fourth studio album was &quot;The Ferryman&quot;, inspired by the Hermann Hesse book &quot;Siddhartha&quot;. That year also saw McTell&#x27;s first tour in the United States.

Initially, Paramount Records had been McTell&#x27;s American label but had not been supportive, and he later signed with Warner Bros. Records. While in the US, McTell hung out with the British folk-rock band Fairport Convention, establishing a lifelong professional relationship as well as personal friendships.

Paramount put a new recording of &quot;Streets of London&quot; on the US release of &quot;You Well-Meaning Brought Me Here&quot;, and, in April 1972, issued it as a single in the Netherlands, where it charted, climbing slowly to No. 9 in May.

McTell&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Not Till Tomorrow&quot;, was produced by Tony Visconti, and released on Reprise in 1972. His UK concert tour played to packed houses and he met one of his guitar heroes, the Rev Gary Davis. By the end of the year, he&#x27;d parted company with Jo Lustig and his brother Bruce was again managing his career.

Although living in Putney, southwest London, Ralph and Nanna bought a derelict cottage in Cornwall during 1972.

===The Royal Albert Hall===
During 1973, McTell undertook two major tours. The spring tour culminated in a sell-out concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall on 5 May, whilst the winter tour was completed in front of a full house at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 30 January 1974. By the end of the year, McTell was in the studio with Visconti again working on his next album. Released early in 1974, &quot;Easy&quot; won critical acclaim. It was promoted by lengthy tours of Britain and Europe with Danny Thompson and Mike Piggott as backing musicians. Despite the civil unrest and violence in Northern Ireland, the tour included concerts in the province – in fact, McTell continued to play there regularly throughout &#x27;the Troubles&#x27;.

===&#x27;Streets of London&#x27; and the band===
McTell re-recorded &quot;Streets of London&quot; with bassist Rod Clements and backing vocalists Prelude. Released as a single (recorded on the Reprise label) on 7 December 1974, it rocketed up the charts to No. 2 in the first week of 1975, became a worldwide million-seller, and won McTell the Ivor Novello Award.

In early 1975, McTell released the album &quot;Streets...&quot;, which sold strongly and spent twelve weeks in the album charts. Backing musicians on the album included Lindisfarne&#x27;s Rod Clements, Fairport Convention&#x27;s Dave Pegg and Jerry Donahue, and Maddy Prior from Steeleye Span, who inspired McTell to write the song &quot;Maddy Dances&quot;. He decided to tour with a band to promote the album, but the experiment was not a success. That tour, he recalls, &quot;became a nightmare.&quot; It was time for a break. McTell went to America with his family where he spent time relaxing and writing. Refreshed, he returned to the UK. His single &quot;Dreams of You&quot;, released in November 1975, reached number 36 in the UK charts.

During 1976, McTell topped the bill at Montreux Jazz Festival and played another sold-out concert at The Royal Albert Hall. This was followed by his first tour of Australia and the far east. At McTell&#x27;s insistence, local buskers were given free tickets for the flagship concert at Sydney Opera House.

Ralph and Nanna&#x27;s son Tom was born on 7 September 1976.

McTell&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Right Side Up&quot;, was released late in 1976 and the year ended with a packed-out Christmas concert in Belfast where he got standing ovations both before and after the show.

The concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and Sydney Opera House had both been recorded and in 1977, Warner Bros. Records released the live album &quot;Ralph, Albert and Sydney&quot;.

During the year, McTell met John &#x27;Jonah&#x27; Jones, a popular figure on London&#x27;s music scene. It was the start of a close friendship that lasted until John&#x27;s death in 2003. After tours in the US and Britain, McTell again appeared at Cambridge Folk Festival.

===Quieter times===
Ralph and Nanna&#x27;s son Billy was born on 19 April 1978. Professionally, it was a quieter year and Ralph spent time with his family in their homes in London and Cornwall.

In March 1979, McTell played The Royal Festival Hall accompanied by Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks of Fairport Convention, and Nigel Smith and Mike Piggott.

McTell had written a number of new songs and went into the studio with backing musicians including Richard Thompson, Dave Pegg and Simon Nicol. The resulting album, &quot;Slide Away The Screen&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Records.

The recording contract with Warner Bros. Records expired in 1980 so McTell and Bruce May set up Mays Records as an &#x27;own brand&#x27; label. It would be a year or more until they had an album to release but McTell continued to tour.

During 1981, McTell, Dave Pegg, Dave Mattacks and Richard Thompson formed an impromptu band called The GP&#x27;s. They performed half-a-dozen concerts but contractual restrictions meant the band could not be developed further.

The first release on Mays Records was the 1981 single &quot;England&quot;, a song later adopted as the theme for a television travelogue presented by comedian Billy Connolly, a long-standing friend of McTell. Mays Records&#x27; first album release was &quot;Water of Dreams&quot;, which featured &quot;Bentley &amp; Craig&quot;, the song that led to McTell&#x27;s support of the campaign to grant Derek Bentley a posthumous pardon.

===Television===
In 1982, McTell&#x27;s career took an unexpected change of direction. Granada Television commissioned &quot;Alphabet Zoo&quot;, a series of children&#x27;s programmes built around songs written and performed by McTell. Although initially reluctant to accept the offer, the fact that one of his heroes, Woody Guthrie, had composed dozens of songs for children, convinced him it was worthwhile. The first series, broadcast in 1983, was a success. A second series followed and Mays Records released two albums of the material – &quot;Songs From Alphabet Zoo&quot; and &quot;Best of Alphabet Zoo&quot;.

During 1983, McTell presented his own music series on BBC Radio 2. His guests included Billy Connolly, Georgie Fame, Simon Nicol with Dave Swarbrick, and Mike Harding.

In 1984, McTell fronted another children&#x27;s TV programme, called &quot;Tickle on the Tum&quot;, again built around his songs. McTell featured in three series alongside guests including John Wells, Willie Rushton, Kenny Lynch, Penelope Keith and Nerys Hughes. Mays Records released &quot;The Best of – Tickle on the Tum&quot; in 1986. The first series was released on DVD by Revelation Films in 2010.

McTell was still playing concerts between his television commitments and he toured during 1984 at home and in Canada and the United States. After composing the music for a Skol lager advertising campaign, he decided to concentrate on his musical career and turned down further television work.

===Commercialism===
Bruce May negotiated a deal with Telstar Records, a company that pushed its products heavily with major advertising and hyping campaigns. McTell was persuaded to record an album that mixed his own material and &#x27;classic songs&#x27; such as &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Morning Has Broken&quot; and &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;. The result, &quot;At the End of a Perfect Day&quot;, released late in 1985, was one of McTell&#x27;s least satisfactory recordings. It was &quot;a totally commercial venture and a miserable failure,&quot; he said later; &quot;...while I was reluctant to do it, the possibility of getting the kind of back-up that Telstar were offering was too good to miss.&quot;

The next year McTell was back on form with &quot;Bridge of Sighs&quot;. Released on Mays Records in 1987, the album gathered together a lot of hitherto unfinished songs. It included &quot;The Girl from the Hiring Fair&quot; (originally written for Fairport Convention, and in whose core repertoire it remains to this day), and &quot;The Setting&quot;, influenced by Seán Ó Faoláin.

===Homage===
As well as tours in his own right, McTell secured a prestigious support slot in 1987 opening the shows on The Everly Brothers&#x27; UK tour. 

After tours in Europe, the US and Australia, McTell was back in the studio in February 1988 to record the album &quot;Blue Skies Black Heroes&quot;. Released on his own Leola Music label, the album was a homage to the blues and ragtime musicians who had so influenced his playing.

&quot;Nearly all my guitar heroes are black, American, usually blind and most of &#x27;em dead,&quot; McTell said. All the tracks on &quot;Blue Skies Black Heroes&quot; were recorded as live takes, four with Danny Thompson on bass. The follow-up tour that summer saw McTell on the road with a veritable arsenal of guitars.

1988 also saw the release of a compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Ralph McTell&quot;. Issued by Start, it was McTell&#x27;s first album to appear on CD.

McTell was a regular visitor to, and occasional performer at, Fairport Convention&#x27;s annual music festival in the village of Cropredy, near Banbury. The location inspired him to pen the ballad &quot;Red and Gold&quot; about the English Civil War, which has become another staple of Fairport&#x27;s repertoire.

At the end of 1988, Bruce May ceased to be McTell&#x27;s manager, the post being taken by Mick McDonagh.

===Castle compilations===
In 1989, McTell signed a deal with the label Castle Communications to produce a compilation of his love songs. For contractual reasons, some songs had to be re-recorded in Dave Pegg&#x27;s Woodworm Studio in Barford St. Michael. The resulting album, &quot;A Collection of His Love Songs&quot;, was subtitled &#x27;Affairs of the Heart&#x27;.

To support the album&#x27;s release, McTell undertook an extensive tour in the autumn and early winter. The tour was well-supported with PR material and was managed on the road by John &#x27;Jonah&#x27; Jones.

The next year, 1990, Castle released &quot;Stealin&#x27; Back&quot;, another collection of McTell&#x27;s blues and jug band numbers.

In 1991, McTell shared the billing with Donovan on a tour of Germany. He also toured in his own right in the UK.

A second Castle compilation was released in 1992 to celebrate McTell&#x27;s 25 years of recording. &quot;Silver Celebration&quot; featured a selection of tracks including &quot;The Ferryman&quot;, &quot;From Clare to Here&quot; and &quot;Streets of London&quot;. A very extensive Silver Celebration tour occupied much of the year, again managed by &#x27;Jonah&#x27; Jones.

Castle had by now obtained the rights to the Transatlantic catalogue, and released a &quot;Best of&quot; CD with 24 tracks from McTell&#x27;s earliest albums. Castle subsequently licensed the early McTell back-catalogue to other labels, resulting in the release of several CD compilations under such titles as &quot;The Best of Ralph McTell&quot; or &quot;Streets of London&quot;.

===&quot;The Boy with a Note&quot;===
McTell completed a major project when in 1992, the BBC commissioned and broadcast &quot;The Boy with a Note&quot; – &#x27;an evocation of the life of Dylan Thomas in words and music&#x27;. It was re-recorded and released on McTell&#x27;s Leola label as an album. McTell is very proud of this ambitious piece. &quot;Two or three years went into that,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s grown-up work.&quot;

During 1993, McTell toured Australia and the Far East, and back home he undertook The Black And White Tour. Road Goes on Forever Records released &quot;The Complete Alphabet Zoo&quot;, presenting the songs from the two television series in alphabetical order. McTell and Mick McDonagh parted company.

In 1994 McTell took part in a concert at the Royal Albert Hall to commemorate the life of Ken Woolard. Ken was the founder of Cambridge Folk Festival and McTell assembled a band, Good Men in the Jungle, to play at that summer&#x27;s festival. He also celebrated his fiftieth year by giving up smoking.

&quot;Slide Away The Screen&quot; was released as a CD by Road Goes on Forever Records with three previously unreleased songs added.

&quot;Sand in Your Shoes&quot; was recorded at Woodworm, by now relocated in Barford St Michael near Banbury. The album came out on the Transatlantic label during 1995.

McTell performed his song &quot;Bentley &amp; Craig&quot; at a special service for Derek Bentley held in Croydon cemetery with the Bentley family. Bentley&#x27;s sister Iris died before he was pardoned and, at her request, McTell performed at her funeral a few years later.

In 1995 McTell performed songs from &quot;The Boy with a Note&quot; at the Year of Literature Festival in Swansea, in South Wales.

===Tickety Boo===
In 1996, McTell presented BBC radio&#x27;s coverage of Sidmouth Festival and toured the UK, Europe, and the US.

McTell&#x27;s long-standing sound engineer, Gordon &#x27;Doon&#x27; Graham, had captured many of McTell&#x27;s concert performances on the desk, and an album of live material from 1976 to 1995 was released on Leola as &quot;Songs for Six Strings Vol II&quot;.

Early in 1997, McTell began his association with Tickety Boo, the company which produced Billy Connolly&#x27;s &#x27;World Tour of...&#x27; television series. &quot;In The Dreamtime&quot;, the song played over the closing credits to &quot;Billy Connolly&#x27;s World Tour of Australia,&quot; later featured on McTell&#x27;s album &quot;Red Sky&quot;.

In the same year, McTell was the subject of a major feature in &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper. An authorised biography of McTell, entitled &quot;Streets of London&quot;, was published by Northdown Publishing. McTell&#x27;s concert at Croydon Town Hall was filmed, and released on videocassette as &quot;Live at the Town Hall&quot; by Leola in 1998.

By now, Leola had taken most of McTell&#x27;s management arrangements in-house. Two sell-out concerts in London&#x27;s Purcell Room were recorded by McTell&#x27;s tour manager and sound engineer, Donard Duffy, and released on Leola as a two-CD set. Entitled &quot;Travelling Man&quot;, the double album came out in time for McTell&#x27;s 1999 spring tour. A two-page feature about McTell appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in May 1999.

===New century===
McTell had been busy writing during the previous couple of years and the result was &quot;Red Sky&quot;. Recorded at Woodworm and released in 2000 on the Leola label, the album contained 19 listed tracks plus &quot;Tickety-boo&quot; as an instrumental hidden track.

McTell&#x27;s output was not restricted to songs, however. He had been working on an autobiography for some years and the first volume, entitled &quot;Angel Laughter&quot;, was published by Heartland Publishing in 2000.

To promote &quot;Angel Laughter&quot;, McTell undertook a tour of bookshops and libraries.

In 2001, McTell undertook a special tour of the UK. Billed as &#x27;The National Tour&#x27;, it gave McTell a chance to present concerts featuring his newly acquired National Steel resonator guitar. Two live recordings from the National Tour made their way onto the 2002 Leola album &quot;National Treasure&quot;.

On Sunday 22 February 2002, McTell appeared to a sellout audience at Liverpool&#x27;s Empire Theatre. The event was marked as a tribute to the late George Harrison who had died the previous November. The date would have been George&#x27;s 59th birthday. McTell appeared alongside Steve &#x27;Cockney Rebel&#x27; Harley, Darren Wharton (Thin Lizzy), Sir Paul McCartney and many others to raise £36,000 for the 3 main cancer charities. 

Heartland published &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;, the second volume of McTell&#x27;s autobiography, in 2002. Another highlight of the year was the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting presented to McTell at the annual BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. By then, McTell had written and recorded well over 200 songs.

McTell had been touring extensively at home and abroad for many years so in 2003 he decided to take a break from the road. He split the year between his London and Cornwall homes and spent the time writing, travelling and spending time with his grandchildren.

Early in 2004, McTell co-headlined on Steeleye Span&#x27;s tour of Australia and New Zealand as well as touring in the UK, Ireland and continental Europe.

McTell appeared at the fortieth Cambridge Folk Festival (the performance was broadcast on BBC Four television) and also played at the fiftieth Sidmouth Festival. He made a guest appearance at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention in August.

===&quot;The Journey&quot;===

McTell celebrated his 60th birthday with a concert at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall in November 2004. The entire show was filmed and released on DVD in 2005 as &quot;The London Show&quot;.

Leola published &quot;Time&#x27;s Poems – The Song Lyrics of Ralph McTell&quot; towards the end of 2005. Dedicated &quot;to Woody Guthrie, the man who started it all for me&quot;, &quot;Time&#x27;s Poems&quot; contains &quot;...all the songs I could find in notebooks, on scraps of paper and old tapes, on records and CDs&quot;.

In 2006, McTell&#x27;s &#x27;Walk Into The Morning&#x27; tour was a sellout success.

For his &#x27;up close&#x27; tour in September 2006, McTell performed a set billed as &#x27;Dylan, Guthrie and The Country Blues&#x27;, featuring his covers of songs by Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan and black American blues artists such as Big Bill Broonzy. He also recorded an album of the material, titled &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;. McTell described the music on this CD as &quot;…the beginning of my own journey… these songs are almost sacred to me&quot;.

A boxed set of four CDs (accompanied by an extended essay on McTell&#x27;s songs by Paul Jenkins) was released in October 2006. Compiled by David Suff from recordings made between 1965 and 2006, &quot;The Journey&quot; was promoted with several radio interviews and a major tour that included two &#x27;gala&#x27; concerts at London&#x27;s Union Chapel. The box set&#x27;s packaging was designed by John Haxby, who also took the cover photograph.

A solo tour of Australia early in 2007 was followed by &#x27;The Journey Continues&#x27; tour in the UK. In August 2007, Sanctuary Records recognised the 40th anniversary of McTell&#x27;s first recording contract by re-releasing his three Transatlantic albums as CDs with bonus tracks.

===&quot;As Far As I Can Tell&quot;===

In October 2007, McTell released an &#x27;audio book&#x27; titled &quot;As Far As I Can Tell&quot;. The three CDs included readings from the autobiography interspersed with new recordings of the songs they inspired. The &quot;As Far As I Can Tell&quot; treble CD was promoted by a tour that included a concert at St Mary&#x27;s church in Banbury, a location that featured in the first volume of autobiography.

A compilation CD comprising McTell&#x27;s own selection of songs, including the &#x27;hit&#x27; version of &quot;Streets of London&quot;, was released in December 2007 on the Highpoint label as &quot;The Definitive Collection&quot;.

During 2008, McTell combined the two volumes of his autobiography into a single volume under the title &quot;As Far As I Can Tell&quot; for publication to coincide with his autumn tour. The new edition featured additional chapters illustrated by photos from the May family album.

On 9 October 2008, McTell appeared on BBC1 TV&#x27;s nationally broadcast magazine programme &quot;The One Show&quot; in a pre-recorded package about the song &quot;Streets of London&quot;. The interview was filmed in Paris and conducted by Myleene Klass.

The appearance on &quot;The One Show&quot; was the springboard for two &#x27;official&#x27; McTell internet videos. Made by Leola Music Ltd and published on YouTube, the videos featured McTell talking about his work and about &quot;Streets of London&quot;, with concert footage shot at the Institute of Contemporary Arts.

The Institute of Contemporary Arts concert footage was released during 2008 as a full-length DVD titled &quot;McTell on The Mall&quot;.

McTell embarked on his most extensive UK tour for many years in October 2008, visiting thirty venues throughout England. The concert at Birmingham Town Hall was unusual because McTell, who rarely appears with a supporting act, shared the bill with The Dylan Project.

===Story songs===

McTell released his first downloadable album in July 2009, titled &quot;Streets of London and Other Story Songs&quot;, comprising twelve tracks from his back-catalogue.

McTell&#x27;s summer 2009 festival appearances included a solo set at Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention on Saturday 15 August. He also joined Fairport Convention onstage during their set later the same evening.

In October 2009, McTell was honoured by the UK Parliament’s All Party Folk Music Group at a special award ceremony in the House of Commons, to celebrate his lifetime&#x27;s contribution to folk music. This was only the second time such an award had been made, the previous recipient having been Tom Paxton.

In early 2010, McTell&#x27;s Leola Music record label released &quot;Affairs of the Heart&quot;, a four-CD box set of love songs in a presentation package. In keeping with its theme, the album was released on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 14 February. There were no previously-unrecorded songs among the fifty-six tracks on the set. Two tracks were specially re-recorded but the remaining fifty-four were digital remixes of previous recordings. Comedian Rory McGrath contributed extensive sleeve notes in the set&#x27;s accompanying booklet. The sleeve design and set packaging concept were by designer Peter Thaine.

During 2010, McTell recorded an album of new songs, his first for ten years, and released in October as &quot;Somewhere Down the Road&quot;. He kept an online diary of the album’s progress which described assembling the material, the recording sessions and preparing for release. McTell’s UK autumn tour was branded with the same title.

On 21 November 2010, McTell released a seasonal song, &quot;The Things You Wish Yourself&quot;, as a download-only single.

===Tribute===

McTell was invited to record his own interpretation of a Bob Dylan song for the BBC Radio 2 celebration of Dylan&#x27;s 70th birthday in May 2011. &quot;Don’t Think Twice It’s Alright&quot; was also the title of McTell&#x27;s own six-song tribute to Dylan, which was released as a downloadable EP.

McTell embarked on a 36-date UK autumn tour in September 2011, culminating in a concert at London&#x27;s Cadogan Hall on 11 December. On the first night of the tour, McTell launched his new &quot;Songs For Six Strings&quot; boxed set.

In April and May 2012, McTell undertook a short tour of Australia. McTell&#x27;s 2012 UK tour, branded “An English Heartbeat”, commenced in October, and saw the release of a CD of guitar instrumentals called &quot;Sofa Noodling&quot;. In an interview published ahead of his 2013 &quot;One More for the Road&quot; tour, McTell said, &quot;It could be the last time I do a big tour... this is the beginning of slowing things down.&quot;

The spring of 2014 saw McTell touring the Celtic nations of the British Isles, and the release of a CD compilation of Celt-themed songs, &quot;Celtic Cousins&quot;. A high point of the tour was a performance of McTell&#x27;s tribute to Dylan Thomas, &quot;The Boy With a Note&quot;, in Thomas&#x27;s adopted home town of Laugharne in South Wales. Later in the year, McTell marked the centenary of the start of the first world war with a four-song EP, &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;.

McTell celebrated his 70th birthday with a concert at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, on 7 December 2014. A DVD of the concert was released in 2015.

===&quot;About Time&quot;===

2015 saw little sign of &quot;slowing things down&quot;, as McTell played more than 30 solo shows over the year. Towards the end of the year, McTell started a recording project with one of his earliest performing partners, Wizz Jones. The resulting CD was released in June 2016 with the appropriate title &quot;About Time&quot;. McTell&#x27;s fifty years as a recording artist was marked by Martin Guitars with a &#x27;signature&#x27; Ralph McTell guitar, built to McTell&#x27;s specification and marketed as the Martin RM50.

McTell played a special show at the Royal Albert Hall in May 2016. Billed as a &#x27;Loyal Command Performance&#x27;, the setlist was voted for by McTell&#x27;s fans, and McTell performed the 20 songs that received the most votes. Summer highlights included McTell&#x27;s first appearance at the Glastonbury Festival and a return to Fairport&#x27;s Cropredy Convention. In the autumn McTell undertook an extensive tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland. The sixth and final CD of McTell&#x27;s &quot;Songs for Six Strings&quot; boxed set was released during the tour.

== Recent work ==
During 2017, McTell and Jones toured their &quot;About Time&quot; album, which was so well received that they recorded and issued a follow-up album, &quot;About Time Too&quot;. Ahead of his solo autumn tour, McTell invited applicants to submit recordings of original music, from which McTell would select performers to open for him in an ‘open mic’ format at the shows. McTell then chose one act to open his London Palladium concert in October. 

Since 2014, McTell had played an annual benefit concert for the UK homeless charity, Crisis at Christmas, and in 2017 McTell invited The Crisis Choir to sing &quot;Streets of London&quot; with him at his Palladium concert. McTell also recorded his song with The Crisis Choir and guest vocalist Annie Lennox, for release in the lead up to Christmas. The song charted at No.94 in the Official Singles Chart (for downloads, CDs and streams), and at No. 1 in the Official Physical Singles Chart (for CD sales).

In September 2018, McTell made his debut on BBC&#x27;s music show &quot;Later... with Jools Holland&quot;, on which he performed two songs, including the Bob Dylan-inspired &quot;West 4th Street and Jones&quot;. In a short interview segment with Holland, McTell announced a new tour and album for 2019. The album, Hill of Beans, comprising 11 tracks including &quot;West 4th Street and Jones&quot;, was released in September.

On 8 June 2024, McTell was a special guest for Richard Thompson, on the final night of his UK tour, at the Royal Albert Hall.

<doc id="185216" wikidata="Q274131" url="?curid=185216" title="Everglades National Park">
<text>Everglades National Park is a national park of the United States that protects the southern twenty percent of the original Everglades in Florida. The park is the largest tropical wilderness in the United States and the largest wilderness of any kind east of the Mississippi River. An average of one million people visit the park each year. Everglades is the third-largest national park in the contiguous United States after Death Valley and Yellowstone. UNESCO declared the Everglades &amp; Dry Tortugas Biosphere Reserve in 1976 and listed the park as a World Heritage Site in 1979, and the Ramsar Convention included the park on its list of Wetlands of International Importance in 1987. Everglades is one of only three locations in the world to appear on all three lists.

Most national parks preserve unique geographic features; Everglades National Park was the first created to protect a fragile ecosystem. The Everglades are a network of wetlands and forests fed by a river flowing per day out of Lake Okeechobee, southwest into Florida Bay. The park is the most significant breeding ground for tropical wading birds in North America and contains the largest mangrove ecosystem in the Western Hemisphere. Thirty-six threatened or protected species inhabit the park, including the Florida panther, the American crocodile, and the West Indian manatee, along with 350 species of birds, 300 species of fresh and saltwater fish, 40 species of mammals, and 50 species of reptiles. The majority of South Florida&#x27;s fresh water, which is stored in the Biscayne Aquifer, is recharged in the park.

Humans have lived for thousands of years in or around the Everglades. Plans arose in 1882 to drain the wetlands and develop the land for agricultural and residential use. As the 20th century progressed, water flow from Lake Okeechobee was increasingly controlled and diverted to enable explosive growth of the Miami metropolitan area. The park was established in 1934, to protect the quickly vanishing Everglades, and dedicated in 1947, as major canal-building projects were initiated across South Florida. The ecosystems in Everglades National Park have suffered significantly from human activity, and restoration of the Everglades is a politically charged issue in South Florida.

==Geography==

Everglades National Park covers , throughout Dade, Monroe, and Collier counties in Florida, at the southern tip of the Atlantic coastal plain. The elevation typically ranges from 0 to above sea level, but a Calusa-built shell mound on the Gulf Coast rises above sea level.

==Geology==
The terrain of South Florida is relatively and consistently flat. The limestone that underlies the Everglades is integral to the diverse ecosystems within the park. Florida was once part of the African portion of the supercontinent Gondwana. After it separated, conditions allowed a shallow marine environment to deposit calcium carbonate in sand, shells, and coral to be converted into limestone. Tiny bits of shell, sand, and bryozoans compressed over multiple layers forming structures in the limestone called ooids, which created permeable conditions that hold water.

The Florida peninsula appeared above sea level between 100,000 and 150,000 years ago. As sea levels rose at the end of the Wisconsin ice age, the water table appeared closer to land. Lake Okeechobee began to flood, and convection thunderstorms were created. Vast peat deposits south of Lake Okeechobee indicate that regular flooding had occurred about 5,000 years ago. Plants began to migrate, subtropical ones from the northern part of Florida, and tropicals carried as seeds by birds from islands in the Caribbean. The limestone shelf appears to be flat, but there are slight rises—called pinnacles—and depressions caused by the erosion of limestone by the acidic properties of the water. The amount of time throughout the year that water is present in a location in the Everglades determines the type of soil, of which there only two in the Everglades: peat, created by many years of decomposing plant matter, and marl, the result of dried periphyton, or chunks of algae and microorganisms that create a grayish mud. Portions of the Everglades that remain flooded for more than nine months out of the year are usually covered by peat. Areas that are flooded for six months or less are covered by marl. Plant communities are determined by the type of soil and the amount of water present.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, Royal Palm at Everglades National Park has a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;). Summers are long, hot, and very wet and winters are warm and dry.

==Hydrography==
While they are common in the northern portion of Florida, no underground springs feed water into the Everglades system. An underground reservoir called the Floridan aquifer lies about below the surface of South Florida. The Everglades has an immense capacity for water storage, owing to the permeable limestone beneath the exposed land. Most of the water arrives in the form of rainfall, and a significant amount is stored in the limestone. Water evaporating from the Everglades becomes rain over metropolitan areas, providing the fresh water supply for the region. Water also flows into the park after falling as rain to the north onto the watersheds of the Kissimmee River and other sources of Lake Okeechobee, to appear in the Everglades days later. Water overflows Lake Okeechobee into a river wide, which moves almost imperceptibly.

==Ecosystems==
At the turn of the 20th century, common concepts of what should be protected in national parks invariably included formidable geologic features like mountains, geysers, or canyons. As Florida&#x27;s population began to grow significantly and urban areas near the Everglades were developed, proponents of the park&#x27;s establishment faced difficulty in persuading the federal government and the people of Florida that the subtle and constantly shifting ecosystems in the Everglades were just as worthy of protection. When the park was established in 1947, it became the first area within the U.S. to protect flora and fauna native to a region as opposed to geologic scenery. The National Park Service recognizes nine distinct interdependent ecosystems within the park that constantly shift in size owing to the amount of water present and other environmental factors.

===Freshwater sloughs and marl prairies===

Freshwater sloughs are perhaps the most common ecosystem associated with Everglades National Park. These drainage channels are characterized by low-lying areas covered in fresh water, flowing at an almost imperceptible per day. Shark River Slough and Taylor Slough are significant features of the park. Sawgrass growing to a height of or more, and broad-leafed marsh plants, are so prominent in this region that they gave the Everglades its nickname &quot;River of Grass&quot;, cemented in the public imagination in the title for Marjory Stoneman Douglas&#x27;s book (1947), which culminated years of her advocacy for considering the Everglades ecosystem as more than a &quot;swamp&quot;. Excellent feeding locations for birds, sloughs in the Everglades attract a great variety of waders such as herons, egrets, roseate spoonbills (&quot;Platalea ajaja&quot;), ibises and brown pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus occidentalis&quot;), as well as limpkins (&quot;Aramus guarauna&quot;) and snail kites that eat apple snails, which in turn feed on the sawgrass. The sloughs&#x27; availability of fish, amphibians, and young birds attract a variety of freshwater turtles, American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;), Florida cottonmouth (&quot;Agkistrodon conanti)&quot;), and eastern diamondback rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus adamanteus&quot;).
Freshwater marl prairies are similar to sloughs but lack the slow movement of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries it turns into a gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl than they do in peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (&quot;Muhlenbergia sericea&quot;) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry in some parts of the year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians which were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.

===Tropical hardwood hammocks===
Hammocks are often the only dry land within the park. They rise several inches above the grass-covered river and are dominated by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks (&quot;Quercus virginiana&quot;). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (&quot;Psychotria&quot;), white indigoberry (&quot;Randia aculeata&quot;), poisonwood (&quot;Metopium toxiferum&quot;) and saw palmetto (&quot;Serenoa repens&quot;). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form the shape of a teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (&quot;Lysiloma latisiliquum&quot;) and gumbo-limbo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;), rarely grow higher than because of wind, fire, and climate.
The plant growth around the hammock base is nearly impenetrable; beneath the canopy hammocks is an ideal habitat for animals. Reptiles (such as various species of snake and anole) and amphibians (such as the American green tree frog, &quot;Hyla cinerea&quot;), live in the hardwood hammocks. Birds such as barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), woodpeckers, northern cardinals (&quot;Cardinalis cardinalis&quot;), and southern bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus&quot;) nest in hammock trees. Mammal species living in hardwood hammocks include Florida black bears (&quot;Ursus americanus floridanus&quot;), red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), minks (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), marsh rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus palustris&quot;), gray foxes (&quot;Urocyon cinereoargenteus&quot;), white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;), and the rare, critically endangered Florida panther (&quot;Puma concolor couguar&quot;).

===Pineland===

Miami-Dade County was once covered in of pine rockland forests, but most of it was harvested by the lumber industry. Pineland ecosystems (or pine rocklands) are characterized by shallow, dry sandy loam over a limestone substrate covered almost exclusively by slash pines (&quot;Pinus elliottii var. densa&quot;). Trees in this ecosystem grow in solution holes, where the soft limestone has worn away and filled with soil, allowing plants to take hold. Pinelands require regular maintenance by fire to ensure their existence. South Florida slash pines are uniquely adapted to promote fire by dropping a large amount of dried pine needles and shedding dry bark. Pine cones require heat from fires to open, allowing seeds to disperse and take hold. The trunks and roots of slash pines are resistant to fire. Prescribed burns in these areas take place every three to seven years; without regular fires, hardwood trees begin to grow in this region, and pinelands become recategorized as mixed swamp forests. Most plants in the area bloom about 16 weeks after a fire. Nearly all pinelands have an understory of palm shrubs and a diverse ground covering of wild herbs.

Pine rocklands are considered one of the most threatened habitats in Florida; less than of pineland exist outside the park. Within the park, of pineland are protected. A variety of animal species meet their needs for food, shelter, nesting, and rooking in pine rocklands. Woodpeckers, eastern meadowlarks (&quot;Sturnella magna&quot;), loggerhead shrikes (&quot;Lanius ludovicianus&quot;), grackles, and northern mockingbirds (&quot;Mimus polyglottos&quot;) are commonly found in pinelands. Black bears and Florida panthers also live in this habitat.

===Cypress and mangrove===

Cypress trees are conifers that are adapted to live in standing fresh water. They grow in compact structures called cypress domes and in long strands over limestone. Water levels may fluctuate dramatically around cypress domes and strands, so cypresses develop &quot;knees&quot; that protrude from the water at high levels to provide oxygen for the root systems. Dwarf cypress trees grow in drier areas with poorer soil. Epiphytes, such as bromeliads, Spanish moss (&quot;Tillandsia usneoides&quot;), orchids and ferns grow on the branches and trunks of cypress trees. Everglades National Park features twenty-five species of orchids. Tall cypress trees provide excellent nesting areas for birds including wild turkey (&quot;Meleagris gallopavo&quot;), ibis, herons, egrets, anhingas (&quot;Anhinga anhinga&quot;), and belted kingfisher (&quot;Megaceryle alcyon&quot;). Mammals in cypress regions include white-tailed deer, squirrels, raccoons, opossums, skunks, swamp rabbits, river otters (&quot;Lontra canadensis&quot;), and bobcats, as well as small rodents.

Mangrove trees cover the coastlines of South Florida, sometimes growing inland depending on the amount of salt water present within the Everglades ecosystems. During drier years when less fresh water flows to the coast, mangroves will appear among fresh water plants. When rain is abundant, sawgrass and other fresh water plants may be found closer to the coast. Three species of mangrove trees—red (&quot;Rhizophora mangle&quot;), black (&quot;Avicennia germinans&quot;), and white (&quot;Laguncularia racemosa&quot;)—can be found in the Everglades. With a high tolerance of salt water, winds, extreme tides, high temperatures, and muddy soils, mangrove trees are uniquely adapted to extreme conditions. They act as nurseries for many marine and bird species. They are also Florida&#x27;s first defense against the destructive forces of hurricanes, absorbing flood waters and preventing coastal erosion. The mangrove system in Everglades National Park is the largest continuous system of mangroves in the world.
Within the Florida mangrove systems live 220 species of fish, and a variety of crabs, crayfish, shrimp, mollusks, and other invertebrates, which serve as the main source of food for many birds. Dozens of bird species use mangroves as nurseries and food stores, including pelicans, grebes, tricolored herons (&quot;Egretta tricolor&quot;), gulls, terns, hawks and kites, and arboreal birds like mangrove cuckoos (&quot;Coccyzus minor&quot;), yellow warblers (&quot;Dendroica petechia&quot;), and white-crowned pigeons (&quot;Patagioenas leucocephala&quot;). The mangroves also support 24 species of amphibians and reptiles, and 18 species of mammals, including the endangered green turtle (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;), hawksbill sea turtle (&quot;Eretmochelys imbricata&quot;), and West Indian manatee (&quot;Trichechus manatus&quot;).

===Coastal lowlands===
Coastal lowlands, or wet prairies, are salt water marshes that absorb marine water when it gets high or fresh water when rains are heavy. Floods occur during hurricane and tropical storm surges when ocean water can rise several feet over the land. Heavy wet seasons also cause floods when rain from the north flows into the Everglades. Few trees can survive in the conditions of this region, but plants—succulents like saltwort and glasswort—tolerate salt, brackish water, and desert conditions. Animal life in this zone is dependent upon the amount of water present, but commonly found animals include Cape Sable seaside sparrow (&quot;Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis&quot;), Everglades snail kite (&quot;Rostrhamus sociabilis&quot;), wood stork (&quot;Mycteria americana&quot;), eastern indigo snake (&quot;Drymarchon couperi&quot;), and small mammals such as rats, mice, and rabbits.

===Marine and estuarine===

The largest body of water within the park is Florida Bay, which extends from the mangrove swamps of the mainland&#x27;s southern tip to the Florida Keys. Over of marine ecosystem lies in this range. Coral, sponges, and seagrasses serve as shelter and food for crustaceans and mollusks, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. Sharks, stingrays, and barracudas also live in this ecosystem. Pelicans, shorebirds, terns, and black skimmers (&quot;Rynchops niger&quot;) are among the birds frequenting park shorelines. The bay also has its own resident population of bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;).

The bay&#x27;s many basins are broken up by sandbanks that serve as plentiful recreational fishing grounds for snook (&quot;Centropomus undecimalis&quot;), redfish (&quot;Sciaenops ocellatus&quot;), spotted seatrout (&quot;Cynoscion nebulosus)&quot;, tarpon (&quot;Megaflops atlanticus),&quot; bonefish (&quot;Albula vulpes)&quot;, and permit (&quot;Trichinous falcatus)&quot;, as well as snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and bass. Wading birds such as roseate spoonbills (&quot;Platalea ajaja&quot;), reddish egrets (&quot;Egretta rufescens&quot;), and great white herons (&quot;Ardea herodias occidentalis&quot;) have unique subpopulations that are largely restricted to Florida Bay. Other bird species include bald eagles, cormorants, and ospreys. Mammals along the shoreline include raccoons, opossums, bobcats, and fox squirrels.

==Human history==

===Native peoples===


Humans likely first inhabited the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Two tribes of Native Americans developed on the peninsula&#x27;s southern tip: the Tequesta lived on the eastern side and the Calusa, greater in numbers, on the western side. The Everglades served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the Miami River, while the Calusa lived in 30 villages. Both groups traveled through the Everglades but rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.

The diets of both groups consisted mostly of shellfish and fish, small mammals, game, and wild plants. Having access only to soft limestone, most of the tools fashioned by Native Americans in the region were made of shell, bone, wood, and animal teeth; shark teeth were used as cutting blades, and sharpened reeds became arrows and spears. Shell mounds still exist today within the park, giving archaeologists and anthropologists evidence of the raw materials available to the indigenous people for tool construction. Spanish explorers estimated the number of Tequesta at first contact to be around 800, and Calusa at 2,000; the National Park Service reports there were probably about 20,000 natives living in or near the Everglades when the Spanish established contact in the late 16th century. The Calusa lived in social strata and were able to create canals, earthworks, and shellworks. The Calusa were also able to resist Spanish attempts at conquest.

The Spanish had contact with these societies and established missions further north, near Lake Okeechobee. In the 18th century, invading Creeks incorporated the dwindling numbers of the Tequesta into their own. Neither the Tequesta nor Calusa tribe existed by 1800. Disease, warfare, and capture for slavery were the reasons for the eradication of both groups. The only evidence of their existence within the park boundaries is a series of shell mounds that were built by the Calusa.

In the first half of the 19th century, people call Spanish Indians and Muspas lived in southern Florida. At the same time Creeks, escaped African slaves, and other Indians from northern Florida displaced by the Creek War, formed the area&#x27;s Seminole nation. After the end of the Seminole Wars in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to Indian territory near Oklahoma. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today Big Cypress National Preserve, to escape the forced emigration to the west. Some survivors of the &quot;Spanish Indians&quot; were sent to Indian Territory with the Seminoles. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and Miccosukee lived in relative isolation, making their living by trading. In 1928, surveying and construction began on the Tamiami Trail, along the northern border of Everglades National Park. The road bisected the Everglades, introducing a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.

Some members of the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes continue to live within park boundaries. Management of the park includes approval of new policies and procedures by tribal representatives &quot;in such a manner that they do not conflict with the park purpose&quot;.

===American settlements===
Following the end of the Seminole Wars, Americans began settling at isolated points along the coast in what is now the park, from the Ten Thousand Islands to Cape Sable. Communities developed on the two largest pieces of dry ground in the area, on Chokoloskee Island and at Flamingo on Cape Sable, both of which established post offices in the early 1890s. Chokoloskee Island is a shell mound, a midden built roughly 20 feet (6 m) high over thousands of years of occupation by the Calusa. The settlements in Chokoloskee and Flamingo served as trading centers for small populations of farmers, fishermen, and charcoal burners settled in the Ten Thousand Islands. Both settlements and the more isolated homesteads could only be reached by boat until well into the 20th century. Everglades City, on the mainland near Chokoloskee, enjoyed a brief period of prosperity when, beginning in 1920, it served as the headquarters for the construction of the Tamiami Trail. A dirt road from Florida City reached Flamingo in 1922, while a causeway finally connected Chokoloskee to the mainland&#x27;s Everglades City in 1956. After the park was established, private property in the Flamingo area was claimed by eminent domain, and the site was incorporated into the park as a visitor center.

===Land development and conservation===

Several attempts were made to drain and develop the Everglades in the 1880s. The first canals built in the Everglades did little harm to the ecosystem, as they were unable to drain much of it. Napoleon Bonaparte Broward based the majority of his 1904 campaign for governor on how drainage would create &quot;The Empire of the Everglades&quot;. Broward ordered the drainage that took place between 1905 and 1910, and it was successful enough that land developers sold tracts for $30 per acre, settling the town of Davie, and developing regions in Lee and Dade counties. The canals also cleared water that made way for agricultural fields growing sugarcane.

In the 1920s, a population boom in South Florida created the Florida land boom, which was described by author Michael Grunwald as &quot;insanity&quot;. Land was sold before any homes or structures were built on it and in some cases before any plans for construction were in place. New landowners, eager to make good on their investments, hastily constructed homes and small towns on recently drained land. Mangrove trees on the coasts were taken down for better views and replaced with shallow-rooted palm trees. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on larger canals to control the rising waters in the Everglades. Nevertheless, Lake Okeechobee continued to rise and fall, the region was covered with rain, and city planners continued to battle the water. The 1926 Miami Hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee levees to fail; hundreds of people south of the lake drowned. Two years later, the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane claimed 2,500 lives when Lake Okeechobee once again surged over its levees. Politicians who declared the Everglades uninhabitable were silenced when a four-story wall, the Herbert Hoover Dike, was built around Lake Okeechobee. This wall effectively cut off the water source from the Everglades.

Following the wall&#x27;s construction, South Florida endured a drought severe enough to cause serious wildfires in 1939. The influx of humans had a detrimental effect on the plants and animals of the region when melaleuca trees (&quot;Melaleuca quinquenervia&quot;) were introduced to help with drainage, along with Australian pines brought in by developers as windbreaks. The region&#x27;s timber was devastated for lumber supplies. Alligators, birds, frogs, and fish were hunted on a large scale. Entire rookeries of wading birds were shot to collect their plumes, which were used in women&#x27;s hats in the early 20th century. The largest impact people had on the region was the diversion of water away from the Everglades. Canals were deepened and widened, and water levels fell dramatically, causing chaos in food webs. Salt water replaced fresh water in the canals, and by 1997 scientists noticed that salt water was seeping into the Biscayne Aquifer, South Florida&#x27;s water source.

In the 1940s, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, a freelance writer and former reporter for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, began to research the Everglades for an assignment about the Miami River. She studied the land and water for five years and published &quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; in 1947, describing the area in great detail, including a chapter on its disappearance. She wrote: &quot;What had been a river of grass and sweet water that had given meaning and life and uniqueness to this enormous geography through centuries in which man had no place here was made, in one chaotic gesture of greed and ignorance and folly, a river of fire.&quot; The book has sold 500,000 copies since its publication, and Douglas&#x27;s continued dedication to ecology conservation earned her the nicknames &quot;Grand Dame of the Everglades&quot;, &quot;Grandmother of the Everglades&quot; and &quot;the anti-Christ&quot; for her singular focus at the expense of some political interests. She founded and served as president for an organization called Friends of the Everglades, initially intended to protest the construction of a proposed Big Cypress jetport in 1968. Successful in that confrontation, the organization has grown to over 4,000 members, committed to the preservation of the Everglades. She wrote and spoke about the importance of the Everglades until her death at age 108 in 1998.

==Park history==
Floridians hoping to preserve at least part of the Everglades began to express their concern over diminishing resources in the early 20th century. Royal Palm State Park was created in 1916 and protected Paradise Key; it included several trails and a visitor center several miles from Homestead. Miami-based naturalists first proposed that the area become a national park in 1923. Five years later, the Florida state legislature established the Tropical Everglades National Park Commission to study the formation of a protected area. The commission was led by Ernest F. Coe, a land developer turned conservationist, who was eventually nicknamed Father of Everglades National Park. Coe&#x27;s original plan for the park included more than including Key Largo and Big Cypress, and his unwillingness to compromise almost prevented the park&#x27;s creation. Various other interests, including land developers and sport hunters, demanded that the size of the park be decreased.

The commission was also tasked with proposing a method to raise the money to purchase the land. The search coincided with the arrival of the Great Depression in the United States, and money for land purchase was scarce. The U.S. House of Representatives authorized the creation of the new national park on May 30, 1934, but the Act (HR 2837), which permanently reserved lands donated by public or private donation as wilderness, passed only with a rider that ensured no money would be allotted to the project for at least five years. Coe&#x27;s passion and U.S. Senator Spessard Holland&#x27;s politicking helped to fully establish the park, after Holland was able to negotiate of the park, leaving out Big Cypress, Key Largo, the Turner River area, and a tract of land called &quot;The Hole in the Donut&quot; that was too highly valued for agriculture. &quot;Miami Herald&quot; editor John Pennekamp was instrumental in pushing the Florida Legislature to raise $2 million to purchase the private land inside the park boundaries. It was dedicated by President Harry Truman on December 6, 1947, one month after Marjory Stoneman Douglas&#x27;s book &quot;The Everglades: River of Grass&quot; was released. The same year, several tropical storms struck South Florida, prompting the construction of of canals, sending water unwanted by farmers and residents to the ocean.

The Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project (C&amp;SF) was authorized by Congress to construct more than one thousand miles of canals and flood control structures across South Florida. The C&amp;SF, run by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, established an agricultural area directly south of Lake Okeechobee, and three water conservation areas, all bordered by canals that diverted excess water either to urban areas or into the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico or Florida Bay. South of these manmade regions was Everglades National Park, which had been effectively cut off from its water supply. By the 1960s, the park was visibly suffering. The C&amp;SF was directed to provide enough water to sustain the park; it did not follow through. A proposed airport that would have dire environmental effects on Everglades National Park became the center of a battle that helped to initiate the environmental movement into local and national politics. The airport proposal was eventually abandoned, and in 1972 a bill was introduced to curb development in South Florida and ensure the national park would receive the amount of water it needed. Efforts turned to repairing the damage wrought by decades of mismanagement: the Army Corps of Engineers changed its focus in 1990 from constructing dams and canals to constructing &quot;purely environmental projects&quot;.

Regions originally included in Ernest Coe&#x27;s vision for a national park were slowly added over the years to the park or incorporated into other protected areas: Biscayne National Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park on Key Largo, Ten Thousand Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary were all protected after the park&#x27;s opening in 1947. Everglades National Park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve on October 26, 1976. On November 10, 1978, , about 86% of the park, was declared a wilderness area. It was renamed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness in 1997. It was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on October 24, 1979, and as a Wetland of International Importance on June 4, 1987. It was placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger from 1993 until 2007 and then again in 2010. The park was added again due to the continued degradation of the set causing significant indications of eutrophication (for example algal blooms) negatively impacting the marine life causing the US government to request UNESCO and IUCN for assistance in development.

===Restoration efforts===
President George H. W. Bush signed the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act on December 13, 1989, that added to the eastern side of the park, closed the park to airboats, directed the Department of the Army to restore water to improve the ecosystems within Everglades National Park, and &quot;Direct(ed) the Secretary of the Interior to manage the Park in order to maintain the natural abundance, diversity, and ecological integrity of native plants and animals, as well as the behavior of native animals, as part of their ecosystem.&quot; Bush remarked in his statement when signing the act, &quot;Through this legislation that river of grass may now be restored to its natural flow of water&quot;.

In 2000, Congress approved the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a federal effort to restore the Everglades with the objectives of &quot;restoration, preservation and protection of the south Florida ecosystem while providing for other water-related needs of the region&quot;, and claiming to be the largest environmental restoration in history. It was a controversial plan; detractors worried that it &quot;relies on uncertain technologies, overlooks water quality, subsidizes damaging growth and delays its environmental benefits&quot;. Supporters of the plan included the National Audubon Society, who were accused by Friends of the Everglades and the Biodiversity Legal Foundation of prioritizing agricultural and business interests.
CERP projects are designed to capture of fresh water every day, store it in underground reservoirs, and release the water to areas within 16 counties in South Florida. Approximately of man-made wetlands are to be constructed to confine contaminated water before it is released to the Everglades, and of canals that divert water away from the Everglades are to be destroyed. During the first five years of implementation, CERP was responsible for the purchase of of land at a cost of $1 billion. The plan aims to spend $10.5 billion over 30 years, combining 50 different projects and giving them 5-year timelines. 

Everglades National Park was directly hit by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita in 2005. Such storms are a natural part of the park&#x27;s ecosystem; 1960&#x27;s Hurricane Donna left nothing in the mangroves but &quot;standing dead snags&quot; several miles wide, but 30 years later the area had completely recovered. Predictably, what suffered the most in the park from the 2005 hurricanes were man-made structures. In 2009 the visitor center and lodge at Flamingo were irreparably damaged by winds and an storm surge; the lodge had been functioning for 50 years when it was torn down; nothing is slated to replace it.

===Park economics===
Everglades National Park reported in 2005 a budget of over $28 million. Of that, $14.8 million was granted from the National Park Service and $13.5 million from various sources including CERP, donations, and other grants. The entry fee for private vehicles in 2021 is $30. Of the nearly one million visitors to Everglades National Park in 2006, more than 38,000 were overnight campers, paying $16 a night or $10 a night for backcountry permits. Visitors spent $2.6 million within the park and $48 million in local economies. More than 900 jobs were sustained or created within or by the park, and the park added value of $35 million to local economies.

=== Leadership and administration ===
Everglades National Park has had 19 superintendents since it was dedicated in 1947. The park&#x27;s first superintendent, Daniel Beard (1947-1958), was also its longest-serving. After Superintendent Beard, Warren F. Hamilton served between 1958 and 1963, followed by Stanley C. Joseph (1963-1966), Roger W. Allin (1966-1968), John C. Raftery (1968-1970), Joseph Brown (1970-1971), Jack E. Stark (1971-1976), John M. Good (1976-1980), John M. Morehead (1980-1986), Marueen E. Finnerty (Acting Superintendent, 1986), Michael V. Finley (1986-1989), Robert L. Arnberger (Acting Superintendent, 1989), Robert S. Chandler (1989-1992), Dick Ring (1992-2000), Marueen E. Finnerty (2000-2003), Dan Kimball (2004-2014), Shawn Benge (Acting Superintendent, 2014), Bob Krumenaker (Acting Superintendent, 2014-2015), and finally Pedro Ramos, who was appointed in 2015 and continues to serve.

The park was placed into Administrative Region I in 1937, when the regions were first established. Region I was retitled the Southeast Region in 1962, which was restructured into the Southeast Area in 1995. The reorganized unified Interior regions put it in the new Region 2.

==Activities==
The busiest season for visitors is from December to March, when temperatures are lowest and mosquitoes are least active. The park features five visitor centers: on the Tamiami Trail (part of U.S. Route 41) directly west of Miami is the &quot;Shark Valley Visitor Center&quot;. A fifteen-mile (24 km) round trip path leads from this center to a two-story observation tower. Tram tours are available during the busy season. Closest to Homestead on State Road 9336 is the &quot;Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center&quot;, where a road begins, winding through pine rockland, cypress, freshwater marl prairie, coastal prairie, and mangrove ecosystems. Various hiking trails are accessible from the road, which runs to the &quot;Flamingo Visitor Center&quot; and marina, open and staffed during the busier time of the year. The &quot;Gulf Coast Visitor Center&quot; is closest to Everglades City on State Road 29 along the west coast. The Gulf Coast Visitor Center gives canoers access to the Wilderness Waterway, a 99-mile (160 km) canoe trail that extends to the Flamingo Visitor Center. The former Royal Palm State Park was the site of the first Everglades National Park visitor center and later became the &quot;Royal Palm Visitor Center&quot; within the park. 
The western coast of the park and the Ten Thousand Islands and the various key islands in Florida Bay are accessible only by boat.

===Trails===
Several walking trails in the park vary in hiking difficulty on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility makes it one of the most visited sites in the park. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half-mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo (&quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;), royal palms (&quot;Roystonea&quot;), strangler figs (&quot;Ficus aurea&quot;), and a variety of epiphytes.

Twenty-eight miles (45 km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to &quot;Swietenia mahagoni&quot;) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.

===Camping and recreation===
Camping is available year-round in Everglades National Park. Camping with some services is available at Long Pine Key, close to the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, where 108 sites are accessible by car. Near Flamingo, 234 campsites with some services are also available. Recreational vehicle camping is available at these sites, but not with all necessary services. Back-country permits are required for campsites along the Wilderness Waterway, Gulf Coast sites, and sites in the various keys. Several back-country sites are chickees; others are beach and ground sites.

Low-powered motorboats are allowed in the park; the majority of salt water areas are no-wake zones to protect manatees and other marine animals from harm. Jet skis, airboats, and other motorized personal watercraft are prohibited. Many trails allow kayaks and canoes. A state license is required for fishing. Fresh water licenses are not sold in the park, but a salt water license may be available. Swimming is not recommended within the park boundaries; water moccasins, snapping turtles (&quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;), alligators, and crocodiles thrive in fresh water. Sharks, barracuda, and sharp dangerous coral are plentiful in salt water. Visibility is low in both salt water and fresh water areas.

Everglades National Park is an important part of the Great Florida Birding Trail. It has great biodiversity and many species of birds for bird watching and bird photography also.
===Dark skies site===

Portions of Everglades National Park are ideal for dark sky observations in South Florida. The best viewing locations are in the remote southern and western areas of the Everglades, such as Flamingo and the Ten Thousand Islands. The Milky Way appears brightest when looking south, toward the least light-polluted areas.

==Threats to the park and ecology==

===Diversion and quality of water===

Less than 50 percent of the Everglades which existed prior to drainage attempts remains intact today. Populations of wading birds dwindled 90 percent from their original numbers between the 1940s and 2000s. The diversion of water to South Florida&#x27;s still-growing metropolitan areas is the Everglades National Park&#x27;s number one threat. In the 1950s and 1960s, of canals and levees, 150 gates and spillways, and 16 pumping stations were constructed to direct water toward cities and away from the Everglades. Low levels of water leave fish vulnerable to reptiles and birds, and as sawgrass dries it can burn or die off, which in turn kills apple snails and other animals that wading birds feed upon. Populations of birds fluctuate; in 2009, the South Florida Water Management District claimed wading birds across South Florida increased by 335 percent. Following three years of increasing numbers, &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; reported in 2009 that populations of wading birds within the park decreased by 29 percent.

Cities along the west coast of Florida rely on desalinization for fresh water; the quantity demanded is too great for the land to provide. Nitrates in the underground water system and high levels of mercury also impact the quality of fresh water the park receives. In 1998, a Florida panther was found dead in Shark Water Slough, with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Increased occurrences of algal blooms and red tide in Biscayne Bay and Florida Bay have been traced to the amounts of controlled water released from Lake Okeechobee. The brochure given to visitors at Everglades National Park includes a statement that reads, &quot;Freshwater flowing into the park is engineered. With the help of pumps, floodgates, and retention ponds along the park&#x27;s boundary, the Everglades is presently on life support, alive but diminished.&quot;

===Urban encroachment===
A series of levees on the park&#x27;s eastern border marks the line between urban and protected areas, but development into these areas threatens the park system. Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park&#x27;s western border, Fort Myers, Naples, and Cape Coral are expanding, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. &quot;National Geographic&quot; rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55 parks by their sustainable tourism, destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: &quot;Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn&#x27;t back off, there will be nothing left of one of this country&#x27;s most amazing treasures&quot;.

===Endangered and threatened animals===
Thirty-six federally protected animals live in the park, some of which face grave threats to their survival.

In the United States, the American crocodile&#x27;s only habitat is within South Florida. They were once overhunted for their hides. They are protected today from hunting but are still threatened by habitat destruction and injury from vehicle collisions when crossing roads to reach waterways. About 2,000 crocodiles live in Florida, and there are roughly 100 nests in the Everglades and Biscayne National Parks. Crocodile populations in South Florida have increased as has the number of alligators. Crocodiles were reclassified from &quot;endangered&quot; to &quot;threatened&quot; in the United States in 2007.

The Florida panther is one of the most endangered mammals on earth. About 230 live in the wild, primarily in the Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp. The biggest threats to the panther include habitat destruction from human development, vehicle collisions, inbreeding due to their limited gene pool, parasites, diseases, and mercury poisoning.

Four Everglade species of sea turtle including the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;), and the Atlantic ridley (&quot;Lepidochelys kempii&quot;) are endangered. Also, the leatherback sea turtle (&quot;Dermochelys coriacea&quot;) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace. Females, however lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss, illegal poaching, and destructive fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.

The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is restricted to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981, 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the locally endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but the loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.

The West Indian manatee has been upgraded from endangered to threatened. Collisions with boats and habitat loss are still its biggest threats.

===Drought, fire, and rising sea levels===
Fire naturally occurs after lightning storms but takes its heaviest toll when water levels are low. Hardwood hammock and cypress trees are susceptible to heavy damage from fire, and some may take decades to grow back. Peat built up over centuries in the marsh can cause fires to burn deep scars in the soil. In 2007, Fred Sklar of the South Florida Water Management District said: &quot;An extreme drought can be viewed (as) almost as catastrophic as a volcano. It can reshape the entire landscape. It can take 1,000 years to produce two inches of peat, and you can lose those couple of inches in a week.&quot;

Rising sea levels caused by global warming are another threat to the future of the park. Since 1932, ocean levels at Key West have steadily risen over , which could have disastrous consequences for land so close to the ocean. It is estimated that within 500 years freshwater habitats in the Everglades National Park will be obliterated by salt water, leaving only the northernmost portion of the Everglades. Cost estimates for raising or replacing the Tamiami Trail and Alligator Alley with bridges are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Through Trump Administration, The Florida Department of Transportation, and Everglades National Park, there are plans to execute and complete the Next Steps project to help fix these various water issues, along with other parts of the park. This completion plan was announced in September 2020, will begin November 2020, and should be done by the end of 2024.

===Non-native species===

The introduction of non-native species into South Florida is a considerable problem for the park. Many of the biological controls such as weather, disease, and consumers who naturally limit plants in their native environments do not exist in the Everglades, causing many to grow larger and multiply far beyond their average numbers in their native habitats. Approximately 26 percent of all fish, reptiles, birds, and mammal species in South Florida are exotic—more than in any other part of the U.S.—and the region hosts one of the highest numbers of exotic plant species in the world.

Species that adapt the most aggressively to conditions in the Everglades, by spreading quickly or competing with native species that sometimes are threatened or endangered, are called &quot;invasive&quot;. Thousands of exotic plant species have been observed in South Florida, usually introduced as ornamental landscaping, but park staff must eradicate such invasive plants as melaleuca tree (&quot;Melaleuca quinquenervia&quot;), Brazilian pepper (&quot;Schinus terebinthifolius&quot;), and Old World climbing fern (&quot;Lygodium microphyllum&quot;). Similarly, animals often do not find the predators or natural barriers to reproduction in the Everglades as they do where they originate, thus they often reproduce more quickly and efficiently. Lobate lac scale insects (&quot;Paratachardina pseudolobata&quot;) kill shrubs and other plants in hardwood hammocks. Bromeliad beetles (&quot;Metamasius callizona&quot;) destroy bromeliads and the ecosystems they host.

Walking catfish (&quot;Clarias batrachus&quot;) can deplete aquaculture stocks and they carry enteric septicemia. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) listed eight &quot;Reptiles of Concern&quot;, including the Burmese python (&quot;Python molurus bivittatus&quot;), focusing on them for their large sizes and aggressive natures, allowing licensed hunters to kill any listed animals in protected areas and sell their meat and hides. Burmese pythons, two subspecies of African rock pythons (&quot;Python sebae&quot;; northern and southern), and yellow anacondas (&quot;Eunectes notaeus&quot;) were banned from import into the U.S. in 2012. United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced the inclusion of these reptiles at Everglades National Park. Exotic species control falls under the management of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has been compiling and disseminating information about invasive species since 1994. Control of invasive species costs $500 million per year, but of land in South Florida remains infested.

<text>Funchal () is the capital, largest city and a municipality in Portugal&#x27;s Autonomous Region of Madeira, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. The city has a population of 105,795, making it the sixth largest city in Portugal. Because of its high cultural and historical value, Funchal is one of Portugal&#x27;s main tourist attractions; it is also popular as a destination for New Year&#x27;s Eve, and it is the leading Portuguese port on cruise liner dockings.

==Etymology==
The first settlers named their settlement Funchal after the abundant wild fennel that grew there. The name is formed from the Portuguese word for fennel, &quot;funcho,&quot; and the suffix &quot;-al&quot;, to denote &quot;a plantation of fennel&quot;:
==History==
The settlement of Funchal began between 1420 and 1425. The island was divided into two captaincies&quot;.&quot; The zones that would become the urbanized core of Funchal were founded by João Gonçalves Zarco who settled there with members of his family. Owing to its geographic location, the site became an important maritime port and its productive soils attracted new settlers. Its coastal position, the most productive on the island, quickly permitted Funchal to develop an urban core and surpass the populations of other settlements.

In the early 15th century, Álvaro Fernandes became the commander of Funchal.

As part of its administrative role, the settlement received its primary lighthouse between 1452 and 1454, when it was elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; and municipal seat. Funchal became an important transfer point for European commercial interests. Many of merchant families established commercial interests on the island, including: João d&#x27;Esmenaut from the Picardy region, the Lomelino from Genoa, the Mondragão from Biscay, the Acciauoli from Florence, the Bettencourts from France, the Lemilhana Berenguer from Valencia and many others.

During the second half of the 15th century, the sugar industry expanded significantly along the southern coast, from Machico until Fajã da Ovelha, making Funchal the most important industrial centre of the industry. By the end of the century, fronting the Order of Christ, D. Manuel, Duke of Beja, expanded the support of the local community; he ordered the construction of the administrative Paços do Concelho and the Paços dos Tabeliães (completed in 1491), raised the construction of a church (began in 1493 and later raised to cathedral in 1514), and finally the construction of a hospital and customs-house in the village. In 1508, it was elevated to the status of city by King Manuel I of Portugal, and in 1514 (on completion of the Sé Cathedral) the bishopric was headquartered in Funchal.
In September 1566, French corsairs under the command of Bertrand de Montluc, a gentleman in the court of Charles IX of France and second-son of Field Marshal Blaise de Montluc, departed from Bordeaux with a force of 1200 men, on a small fleet of three main ships and eight support craft. The armada sacked Porto Santo. When the news was relayed to the settlements on Madeira and the villas of Machico and Santa Cruz, the citizenry armed themselves. In Funchal, the governor, Francisco de Sales Gonçalves Zarco da Câmara, did not take any hostile action. Meanwhile, the armada anchored off the beach of Formosa, disembarked a contingent of 800 men that marched towards the city in three columns, encountering no resistance until the main bridge in São Paulo. At the bridge the privateers encountered a force from the small fort, with a few small-caliber pieces, which were quickly routed in confusion. At the road near Carreira, the attackers were confronted by a small group of Franciscan friars, who were quickly dispatched. Funchal&#x27;s fortifications were finally assaulted by land, where its defense was thin; the defenders could not even reposition many of the cannons directed towards the sea. The city suffered a violent sack that lasted fifteen days, after which little remained.

The following year, the military architect Mateus Fernandes III was sent to Funchal in order to completely modify the defensive system of the city. Evidence of the work produced by this architect was published in the &quot;Mapa de Mateus Fernandes&quot; (1573), considered to be the oldest plan of the island of Funchal. The document identifies the major defenses of the city, which included a large fortification in the area around the dyke in Pena.

During the 16th century, Funchal was an important stop-over for caravels travelling between the Indies and the New World.

The wine culture appeared during early settlement, through the incentives from Henry the Navigator. By 1455, the Venetian navigator, Luís de Cadamosto, on visiting Madeira, referred to the excellence of the Madeirense wines, principally the Malvasia castes from the island of Crete, which were being exported in greater numbers. By the end of the 16th century, the celebrated English poet and playwright, William Shakespeare, cited the important export and notoriety of the Madeiran Malvasia castes: in Richard III the Duke of Clarence, the brother of King Edward IV selected a death by drowning in a barrel of Madeira. Later, in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV&quot; he has Poins censure Falstaff for having sold his soul to the devil for a cup of Madeira wine. The growth of viticulture in Madeira expanded when the sugar industry was attacked by cheaper exports from the New World and Africa, but also from various epidemics and the after-effects of the 1566 privateer sacks. In the 17th century, commercial treaties with England brought increased investments to a business that was still insular. Many commercial wine-makers from England moved to the island, changing the economy, architecture forms and lifestyle of the community. This incremental growth expanded the city with new estates, and a new merchant class that populated the urban quarters. Generally, there were many new three-floor homes with an intermediary service floor, a floor for storage and wine-cellars, and in some cases a tower to watch the port and monitor shipping in the harbour. Various island governors and the convents participated in commercial viticulture. The Companhia de Jesus developed the vast estate of Campanário, which extended from the city to Fajã dos Padres into one of the most successful wines on the island, whereas the nuns of Santa Clara, owners of some large parcels of land, entered into the wine industry, financing the ships that would take their wines to Brazil (and exchanging them for sugar for their sweets business). But, during the 19th century there were epidemics, aggravating the economy and forcing some to return to sugar plantations. In order to maintain the level of development, many landowners tried to plant new more-resistant castes, but of an inferior quality, in order to support the industry.

Among the notable visitors to the region were Queen Adelaide of the United Kingdom, Prince Alexander of the Netherlands (who died in Funchal in 1848), Empress Amélia of Brazil and Elisabeth, empress of Austria-Hungary. Most of them travelled to the island hoping the gentle climate would benefit their health. Charles I of Austria, Emperor of Austria and king of Hungary, 1867–1918, was exiled to Funchal. Polish Field Marshal Józef Piłsudski in order to recuperate his health. Winston Churchill travelled there on holidays and was known to have painted a few paintings during his visits and Fulgencio Batista stopped over en route to his exile in Spain. The presence of these notable visitors marked a period when Funchal became a center of tourism and therapeutic health. With the formal creation of the Port of Funchal, and later the establishment of the Santa Catarina Airport, Funchal turned into a major international tourist destination supported by a series of hotels and ocean-front residences.

==Geography==
===Physical geography===
Funchal is located inside a natural amphitheatre-shaped valley, with gentle slopes beginning at the coast which rise to 1200 metres and provide a natural shelter for early settlers

In addition to the urbanized area, the municipality includes the Ilhas Selvagens (), a nature reserve located south of the capital.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Funchal has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) bordering on a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;As&quot;). It is the warmest city in Portugal, with an annual temperature of .

The climate can be divided into two main seasons: a warm dry summer season spanning from May to September with average daily high temperatures ranging from , and a cool wet winter season from October to April with average daily high temperatures ranging from . The city has warm temperatures all year round, and humidity levels remain constantly high at about 70%.

Sea temperatures range from a low of in February–March to in August–October.

Since the city rises from the sea level up to altitudes of on its northern slopes, it is quite common to experience cloudiness, fog and rain in the northern suburbs while, at the same time, having clear skies in the south. Temperatures also tend to be slightly lower at the higher altitudes.

Early summer, especially June, tends to be quite infamous due to a phenomenon where persistent cloudiness covers the entire bay area of the city, similar to the June Gloom phenomenon, locally nicknamed &quot;Funchal&#x27;s helmet&quot;. The length and severity of the wet and dry seasons varied greatly from year to year.

=== Climate change ===
A 2019 paper published in PLOS One estimated that under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, a &quot;moderate&quot; scenario of climate change where global warming reaches ~ by 2100, the climate of Funchal in the year 2050 would most closely resemble the current climate of Rabat in Morocco. The annual temperature and the temperature of the warmest and coldest month would all increase by , putting the coldest and warmest months above . According to Climate Action Tracker, the current warming trajectory appears consistent with , which closely matches RCP 4.5.

===Human geography===


The urbanised core of the city of Funchal includes several of the civil parishes that surround the municipality (Câmara de Lobos, Santa Cruz, Machico and Ribeira Brava), and includes a population of 150,000 inhabitants, the largest Portuguese city outside of mainland Portugal. The municipality itself is a grouping of several smaller administrative entities, that includes Funchal, Câmara de Lobos, Caniço and Santa Cruz, located along the southern coast of Madeira. Funchal is a cosmopolitan and panoramic city, with parks, shops and hotels.

The municipality () and city () are one administrative division, administered by an executive and legislative committee in the city hall. Local communities, are administered at the civil parish levels, through their own legislative bodies and executives. Funchal comprises ten civil parishes () based on traditional religious districts ():

==Transportation==
Madeira Airport, often known as Funchal Airport (code: FNC) and officially Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport, is located east of the city, in the municipality of Santa Cruz. The airport was one of the most dangerous airports in the world due to the limited flat space in close proximity to cliffs, but the extension of the runway on concrete pillars in the sea has improved safety. It served more than 5 million passengers as of 2024.

The Port of Funchal was the only major port in Madeira. Since 2007 it has been fully dedicated to passenger transport (cruise ships and ferries) and other tourist-related boats and yachts. In that year all remaining fishing activity and cargo trade was moved to the newly developed port of Caniçal, to the east.

A ferry service between Funchal and Portimão, on the mainland, provided by Naviera Armas sailed weekly from 2008, but was discontinued in 2013 due to a dispute over harbour fees. In summer 2018 it was re-instated, but as a seasonal service from July to September, being operated by Grupo Sousa using Naviera Armas&#x27;s ship &quot;Volcán de Tijarafe&quot;, that provided the crossing prior to the 2013 discontinuation, with a maximum speed of 23 knots. The crossing takes around 24 hours.

A ferry runs in two hours between Funchal and Porto Santo Island, called the &quot;Lobo Marinho&quot;.
Funchal is frequently used as a stop-over by transatlantic ships, en route from Europe to the Caribbean, as it is the northernmost Atlantic island that lies in the path of the Westerlies.

A highway provides access to Câmara de Lobos and Ribeira Brava to the west, and Santa Cruz, Machico and Caniçal to the east.

<doc id="185220" wikidata="Q193058" url="?curid=185220" title="Livius Andronicus">
<text>Lucius Livius Andronicus (; ; ) was a Greco-Roman dramatist and epic poet of the Old Latin period during the Roman Republic. He began as an educator in the service of a noble family, producing Latin translations of Greek works, including Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;. The translations were meant, at first, as educational devices for the school which he founded. He also wrote works for the stage—both tragedies and comedies—which are regarded as the first dramatic works written in the Latin language. His comedies were based on Greek New Comedy and featured characters in Greek costume. Thus, the Romans referred to this new genre by the term comoedia palliata or fabula palliata, meaning &quot;cloaked comedy,&quot; the pallium being a Greek-style cloak. The Roman biographer Suetonius later coined the term &quot;half-Greek&quot; of Livius and Ennius (referring to their genre, not their ethnic backgrounds). The genre was imitated by later generations of playwrights, and Andronicus is accordingly regarded as the father of Roman drama and of Latin literature in general; that is, he was the first man of letters to write in Latin. Varro, Cicero, and Horace, all men of letters during the subsequent Classical Latin period, considered Livius Andronicus to have been the originator of Latin literature. He is the earliest Roman poet whose name is known.

== Biography ==
===Origins===
He was born in Tarentum, Magna Graecia. Livius was originally a highly educated Greek, who was bought as a slave by Roman nobles.

===Name===
In ancient sources, Livius Andronicus is either given that name or is simply called Livius. Andronicus is the Latinization of a Greek name, which was held by a number of Greek historical figures of the period. It is generally considered that Andronicus came from his Greek name and that Livius, a name originally local to Latium, was the gentilicium, the family name, of his patron (&quot;patronus&quot;). His career at Rome was launched from servitude and he became a freedman (&quot;libertus&quot;) by the grace of his master, one of the &quot;Livia gens&quot;. The praenomen Lucius is given by Aulus Gellius and Cassiodorus.

===Dates===
Livius&#x27; dates are based mainly on Cicero and Livy. Cicero says, &quot;This Livius exhibited his first performance at Rome in the Consulship of M. Tuditanus, and C. Clodius the son of Caecus, the year before Ennius was born,&quot; that is, in 240 BC. Cicero goes on to relate the point of view of Accius, that Livius was captured from Tarentum in 209, and produced a play in 197. Cicero disagrees with this view on the grounds that it would make Livius younger than Plautus and Naevius, though he was supposed to have been the first to produce a play. Livy says, &quot;The pontiffs also decreed that three bands of maidens, each consisting of nine, should go through the city singing a hymn. This hymn [the &quot;parthenion&quot;) was composed by the poet, Livius.&quot; This action was taken to appease the gods after a series of evil portents in the consulship of &quot;C. Claudius Nero for the first time, M. Livius for the second;&quot; that is, in 207. Only the dates of 240 and 207 seem exempt from controversy.

===Events===
Jerome has some additional detail that tends to support the capture at Tarentum and enslavement. His entry for the year of Abraham 1829, the second year of the 148th Olympiad (186/185 BC), of his &quot;Chronicon&quot;, reads&quot;Titus Livius tragoediarum scriptor clarus habetur, qui ob ingenii meritum a Livio Salinatore, cuius liberos erudiebat, libertate donatus est.&quot;

Titus Livius, author of tragedies, is held to be outstanding. He was given liberty by Livius Salinator, whose children he was educating, by merit of his intelligence.

Jerome is the only author to name him Titus. The passage is ambiguous concerning the events actually happening in Olympiad 148; Andronicus might have been given liberty or simply been honoured, having been liberated long ago. Livius Salinator might be Gaius Livius Salinator, his father Marcus Livius Salinator, or his grandfather Marcus. If Jerome means that the liberation took place in 186, then he seems to be following Accius&#x27; view, which might have been presented in the missing portions of Suetonius&#x27; &quot;de Poetis&quot; and read by Jerome. The passage is not conclusive about anything. However, the mixed name of Livius and his being associated with Salinator suggests that he was captured at the first fall of Tarentum in 272, sold to the first Marcus Livius Salinator, tutored the second and was set free to have an independent career when the task was complete.

==Works==
===&quot;Odusia&quot;===
Livius made a translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, entitled the &quot;Odusia&quot; in Latin, for his classes in Saturnian verse. All that survives is parts of 46 scattered lines from 17 books of the Greek 24-book epic. In some lines, he translates literally, though in others more freely. His translation of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; had a great historical importance. Livius&#x27; translation made this fundamental Greek text accessible to Romans, and advanced literary culture in Latin. This project was one of the first examples of translation as an artistic process; the work was to be enjoyed on its own, and Livius strove to preserve the artistic quality of the original. Since there was no tradition of epic in Italy before him, Livius must have faced enormous problems. For example, he used archaising forms to make his language more solemn and intense. His innovations would be important in the history of Latin poetry.

In the fragments we have, it is clear that Livius had a desire to remain faithful to the original and to be clear, while having to alter untranslatable phrases and ideas. For example, the phrase &quot;equal to the gods&quot;, which would have been unacceptable to Romans, was changed to &quot;summus adprimus&quot;, &quot;greatest and of first rank&quot;. Also, early Roman poetry made use of pathos, expressive force, and dramatic tension, so Livius interprets Homer with a mind to these ideas as well. In general, Livius did not make arbitrary changes to the text; rather, he attempted to remain faithful to Homer and to the Latin language.

=== Plays ===

Livius&#x27; first play, according to Cicero, was staged in 240. Livy tells us that Livius was the first to create a play with a plot. One story says that after straining his voice, Livius, who was also an actor, was the first to leave the singing to singers and limited the actors to dialogue.

His dramatic works were written in the iambic senarius and trochaic septenarius. They included both lyric passages (&quot;cantica&quot;) and dialogue (&quot;diverbia&quot;). His dramatic works had large element of solos for chief actor, often himself. It is not known whether he had a chorus. These dramatic works of Livius Andronicus were consistent with Greek requirements of drama and probably had Greek models, and we have no more than 60 fragments, as quoted in other authors.

The titles of his known tragedies are &quot;Achilles&quot;, &quot;Aegisthus&quot;, &quot;Aiax Mastigophorus&quot; (&quot;Ajax with the Whip&quot;), &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Antiopa&quot;, &quot;Danae&quot;, &quot;Equus Troianus&quot;, &quot;Hermiona&quot;, and &quot;Tereus&quot;.

Two titles of his comedies are certain, &quot;Gladiolus&quot; and &quot;Ludius&quot;, though the third, &quot;Virgo&quot;, is probably corrupt. They were all composed on the model of Greek New Comedy, adapting stories from the Greek. The Romans called this sort of adaptation of comedy by Livius and his immediate successors &quot;fabulae palliatae&quot;, or &quot;comoedia palliata&quot;, named from the &quot;pallium&quot;, or short cloak, worn by the actors. Of Andronicus&#x27; &quot;palliata&quot; we have 6 fragments of 1 verse each and 1 title, &quot;Gladiolus&quot;, (&quot;Little Saber&quot;).

===The hymn===
According to Livy, Livius also composed a hymn for a chorus of 27 girls in honour of Juno to be performed in public as part of religious ceremonies in 207. Because of the success of this hymn, Livius received public honours when his professional organization, the &quot;collegium scribarum histrionumque&quot; was installed in the Temple of Minerva on the Aventine. Actors and writers would gather here and offer gifts.

<doc id="185222" wikidata="Q3258628" url="?curid=185222" title="War Measures Act">
<text>The War Measures Act (; 5 George V, Chap. 2) was a statute of the Parliament of Canada that provided for the declaration of war, invasion, or insurrection, and the types of emergency measures that could thereby be taken. The Act was brought into force three times in Canadian history: during the First World War, Second World War, and the 1970 October Crisis.

The Act was questioned for its suspension of civil liberties and personal freedoms, including only for Ukrainians and other Europeans during Canada&#x27;s first national internment operations of 19141920, the Second World War&#x27;s Japanese Canadian internment, and in the October Crisis. In 1988, it was repealed and replaced by the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot;.

==First World War==

In the First World War, a state of war with Germany was declared by the United Kingdom on behalf of the entire British Empire. Canada was notified by telegraphic despatch accordingly, effective 4 August 1914, and that status remained in effect until 10 January 1920.

The &quot;War Measures Act, 1914&quot;, was subsequently adopted on 22 August 1914 to ratify all steps taken by Canada from the declaration of war, to continue until the war was over. Sections 2 to 6 of the original Act in particular provided for the following:

===Extent of authority under the Act===
The Act conferred broad authority, and was even held by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;In re Gray&quot; to include the power to amend other Acts by way of regulation. Noting that the British House of Lords, in &quot;R v Halliday&quot;, had held in 1917 that the &quot;Defence of the Realm Act 1914&quot; possessed similar wide powers with respect to the United Kingdom, Chief Justice of Canada Sir Charles Fitzpatrick declared:

===Internment during First World War and afterwards===

Canada&#x27;s first national internment operations of 1914–1920 involved the internment of both genuine POWs and thousands of civilians, most of them Ukrainians who had come from western Ukrainian lands (Galicia and Northern Bukovina) then held by the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Branded as &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, they were stripped of what little wealth they had, forced to work for the profit of their jailers and subjected to other state-sanctioned censures, including disenfranchisement under the &quot;Wartime Elections Act&quot;. A campaign begun by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association in 1985 aimed at securing official acknowledgement and symbolic restitution for what happened succeeded in 2005, following passage of the &quot;Internment of Persons of Ukrainian Origin Recognition Act&quot;, which resulted in the establishment of the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund.

With the advent of the Russian Revolution in 1917, additional regulations and orders were added to make the membership in a number of organizations, including socialist and communist organizations, forbidden. Immigration from nations that were connected directly or indirectly with the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Germany was stopped and natives of these countries (Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine) were classed as enemy aliens under the Act. These enemy aliens were required to always carry identification with them and forbidden from possessing firearms, leaving the country without permission, or publishing or reading anything in a language other than English or French. Thousands of these enemy aliens were also interned in camps or deported from Canada. It was not until the labour shortage in Canada became dire that these interned individuals were released into the workforce again in an attempt to boost the economy and the war effort.

==Second World War==

In contrast to the previous war, by virtue of the Statute of Westminster 1931, Canada instituted its measures separately from the United Kingdom. A state of apprehended war was declared on 25 August 1939, and the Defence of Canada Regulations were implemented under the Act. A state of war was declared with Germany on 10 September 1939.

The extreme security measures permitted by the Defence of Canada Regulations included the waiving of habeas corpus and the right to trial, internment, bans on political and religious groups, restrictions of free speech including the banning of certain publications, and the confiscation of property. S. 21 of the Defence of Canada Regulations allowed the Minister of Justice to detain without charge anyone who might act &quot;in any manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the state.&quot; The government soon interned fascists and Communists as well as opponents of conscription. The regulations were later used to intern Japanese Canadians on a large scale as well as some German and Italian Canadians who were viewed as enemy aliens.

In 1940, the more complex nature of organizing the war effort required the &quot;National Resources Mobilization Act&quot; to be adopted as well, and many subsequent regulations were brought into force by virtue of both of these Acts.

In 1943, the Supreme Court of Canada, in the &quot;Chemicals Reference&quot;, ruled that Orders in Council made under the Act were equivalent to an Act of Parliament, as Rinfret J observed:

(Citations omitted.) This authority was cited later in support of decisions taken in the &quot;Reference re Persons of Japanese Race&quot;.

The Act&#x27;s effect was further clarified in the &quot;Wartime Leasehold Regulations Reference&quot;, which held that regulations instituting rental and housing controls displaced provincial jurisdiction for the duration of the emergency. As Taschereau J (as he then was) noted:

The Act was in force until 31 December 1945, after which the &quot;National Emergency Transitional Powers Act&quot;, 1945 was in force until 31 March 1947. In 1947, the &quot;Continuation of Transitional Measures Act&quot;, 1947 was enacted, maintaining certain wartime orders and regulations, and stayed in place until 30 April 1951.

===Treatment of Japanese Canadians===

The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 led to Canada declaring war against Japan on 8 December 1941. An already established racial bias towards Japanese Canadians was transformed into full anti-Japanese thoughts and behaviour by many Canadian citizens who saw Japanese Canadians as spies for Japan. This fear towards Japanese Canadians led to the quick restriction of their rights and freedoms:

* On 17 December 1941, persons of Japanese descent were required to register with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
* On 29 January 1942, a protected area was declared by Government Notice within British Columbia.
* On 24 February, the Defence of Canada Regulations were amended to restrict Japanese Canadians from owning land or growing crops.
* On 26 February, a notice was issued instituting curfews on Japanese Canadians in the protected area of British Columbia, and restricting them from possessing motor vehicles, cameras, radios, firearms, ammunition or explosives.
* On 4 March, regulations under the Act were adopted to forcibly remove Japanese Canadians from the protected area. As a result, 12,000 were interned in interior camps, 2,000 were sent to road camps and another 2,000 were forced to work in the prairies at sugar beet farms.

In December 1945, three Orders in Council were issued to provide for the expulsion of Japanese nationals and other persons of Japanese origin, whether or not they were British subjects (either natural born or naturalized). Although the Supreme Court of Canada gave a mixed ruling on the matter, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council declared all of them to be valid. Following various protests among politicians and academics, the orders were revoked in 1947.

===Control of the wartime economy===
At the beginning of the war, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board was created with a wide mandate to regulate all matters dealing with the necessities of life, rental and housing controls, import and export controls, and wage and price controls. In 1942, its responsibilities were expanded to include the reduction of non-essential industrial activities in order to maintain minimum requirements only for civilian goods.

The Act was also used to create the Wartime Labour Relations Regulations in order to control strikes and lockouts and keep wartime production going. While the regulations were initially restricted to industries under federal jurisdictions and companies directly involved in the war effort, provision was made for the provinces to co-opt into the scheme (which all eventually did).

As labour unrest was widespread at the time, a system of compulsory conciliation was brought into effect, and no strike or lockout could occur until:

* a collective agreement had expired,
* an attempt had been made to negotiate a new agreement,
* compulsory conciliation had been undertaken, and
* fourteen days after the conciliation period had elapsed.

There was, however, frustration on the part of the unions which felt that the government tended to not care about the issues the unions were trying to bring to light. The regulations continued after the war&#x27;s end until 1948, where they were replaced by similar legislation at both the federal and provincial levels.

==Postwar history==

In 1960, the Act was amended by the &quot;Canadian Bill of Rights&quot;, in order to ensure that:

* actions taken under the Act were deemed not to be infringements of the latter statute, and
* proclamations to bring the Act into force were subject to abrogation by both the Senate and the House of Commons.

===The October Crisis===
In 1970, members of the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) kidnapped British diplomat James Cross and Quebec provincial cabinet minister Pierre Laporte, who was later murdered. What is now referred to as the October Crisis raised fears in Canada of a militant faction rising up against the government.

Under provisions of the &quot;National Defence Act&quot;, the Canadian Armed Forces were deployed to assist the police. They appeared on the streets of Ottawa on 12 October 1970. Upon request of the Quebec government with the unanimous consent of all party leaders in the Quebec National Assembly, troops appeared on the streets of Montreal on 15 October.

At the request of the Mayor of Montreal, Jean Drapeau, and the Quebec provincial government, and in response to general threats and demands made by the FLQ, the federal government declared a state of apprehended insurrection under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; on 16 October. This was done so that police had more power in arrest and detention, in order to find and stop the FLQ members.

The use of the Act to address the problem presented by the FLQ was well supported by Canadians in all regions of Canada, according to a December Gallup Poll. However, there were many vocal critics of the government action, including New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas, who said, &quot;The government, I submit, is using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut.&quot;

While the Act was in force, 465 people were arrested and held without charge but were eventually released.

The response by the federal and provincial governments to the incident still sparks controversy. There was a large amount of concern about the act being used, as it was a considered to be a direct threat to civil liberties, removing rights such as &quot;habeas corpus&quot; from all Canadians. This is the only time that the Act had been put in place during peacetime in Canada.

Critics, such as Laurier LaPierre, accused Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s move to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; as more of a reaction to the separatist movement in Quebec by criminalizing it.

The Act&#x27;s 1970 regulations were replaced by the &quot;Public Order (Temporary Measures) Act&quot; in November 1970, which subsequently expired on 30 April 1971.

In October 2020, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-François Blanchet asked PM Justin Trudeau to apologize for the Canadian Government&#x27;s invocation of the Act.

===Replacement===

In May 1981, the Emergency Planning Order was passed, which assigned responsibilities for planning to meet the exigencies of different types of emergencies to various Ministers, departments and agencies of government.

In 1988, the &quot;Emergencies Act&quot; was passed, and the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; was repealed as a consequence.

<doc id="185223" wikidata="Q1329419" url="?curid=185223" title="Elijah McCoy">
<text>Elijah J. McCoy (May 2, 1844 – October 10, 1929) was a Canadian-American engineer of African-American descent who invented lubrication systems for steam engines. Born free on the Ontario shore of Lake Erie to parents who fled enslavement in Kentucky, he traveled to the United States as a young child when his family returned in 1847, becoming a U.S. resident and citizen. His inventions and accomplishments were honored in 2012 when the United States Patent and Trademark Office named its first regional office, in Detroit, Michigan, the &quot;Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Patent Office&quot;.

==Early life==
Elijah McCoy was born in 1844 in Colchester, Ontario, to George and Mildred Goins McCoy. At the time, they were fugitive slaves who had escaped from Kentucky to Ontario via helpers through the Underground Railroad. George and Mildred arrived in Colchester Township, Essex County, in what was then called Upper Canada in 1837 via Detroit. Elijah McCoy had eleven siblings. Ten of the children were born in Ontario from Alfred (1836) to William (1859).

Upper Canadian schools were segregated under the Common Schools Act as amended in 1850, and McCoy was educated in black schools of Colchester Township. At the age of 15, in 1859, Elijah McCoy was sent to Scotland. While there he was apprenticed and, after studying at the University of Edinburgh, certified as a mechanical engineer. Based on 1860 Tax Assessment Rolls, land deeds of sale, and the 1870 US Census it can be determined George McCoy&#x27;s family moved to Ypsilanti, Michigan in the United States in 1859–60; by the time Elijah returned, his family had established themselves on the farm of John and Maryann Starkweather in Ypsilanti. George used his skills as a tobacconist in order to establish a tobacco and cigar business.

==Career==
When Elijah McCoy arrived in Michigan, he could find work only as a fireman and oiler at the Michigan Central Railroad. In a home-based machine shop in Ypsilanti, McCoy also did more highly skilled work, such as developing improvements and inventions. He invented an automatic lubricator for oiling the steam engines of locomotives and ships, patenting it in 1872 as &quot;Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-Engines&quot; ().

Similar automatic oilers had been patented previously; one is the displacement lubricator, which had already attained widespread use and whose technological descendants continued to be widely used into the 20th century. Lubricators were a boon for railroads, as they enabled trains to run faster and more profitably with less need to stop for lubrication and maintenance. By 1899, the Michigan Bureau of Labor and Industrial Statistics reported that the McCoy lubricator was in use on almost all North American railroads.

McCoy continued to refine his devices and design new ones, and was noted in periodicals of the time, including the Railroad Gazette. Most of his patents dealt with lubricating systems, including a further patent in 1898 which added a glass &#x27;sight-feed&#x27; tube to monitor the rate of lubricant delivery ().

After the turn of the century, he attracted notice among his Black contemporaries. Booker T. Washington, in &quot;Story of the Negro&quot; (1909), recognized him as having produced more patents than any other Black inventor up to that time. This creativity gave McCoy an honored status in the Black community that has persisted to this day. He continued to invent until late in life, obtaining as many as 57 patents; most related to lubrication, but others also included a folding ironing board and a lawn sprinkler. Lacking the capital with which to manufacture his lubricators in large numbers, he usually assigned his patent rights to his employers or sold them to investors. In 1920, near the end of his career, he formed the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company.

==Regarding the phrase &quot;The real McCoy&quot;==
This popular expression, typically meaning &quot;the real thing&quot;, has been attributed to Elijah McCoy&#x27;s oil-drip cup invention. One theory is that railroad engineers looking to avoid inferior copies would request it by name, and inquire if a locomotive was fitted with &quot;the real McCoy system&quot;. This theory is mentioned in Elijah McCoy&#x27;s biography at the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

The expression &quot;The real McCoy&quot; was first published in Yorkville (now part of Toronto), Ontario, in 1881. Later, the December 1966 issue of &quot;Ebony&quot;, in an advertisement for Old Taylor bourbon whiskey made mention of Elijah McCoy: &quot;But the most famous legacy McCoy left his country was his name.&quot; Other possibilities for its origin have been proposed, including it being a corruption of the Scottish name &quot;Reay Mackay&quot; and while it has undoubtedly been applied as an epithet to many other McCoys, its association with Elijah has become iconic in American parlance.

== Marriage and death ==
McCoy married for the second time in 1873 to Mary Eleanora Delaney. The couple moved to Detroit when McCoy found work there. Mary McCoy (died 1923) helped found the Phillis Wheatley Home for Aged Colored Men in 1898. Elijah McCoy died in the Eloise Infirmary in Nankin Township, now Westland, Michigan, on 10 October 1929, at the age of 85, as a result of injuries suffered in a car accident seven years earlier in which his wife Mary died. He is buried in Detroit Memorial Park East in Warren, Michigan.

==In popular culture==
*1966, an ad for Old Taylor bourbon cited Elijah McCoy with a photo and the expression &quot;the real McCoy&quot;, ending with the tag line: &quot;But the most famous legacy McCoy left his country was his name.&quot;
*2006, Canadian playwright Andrew Moodie&#x27;s &quot;The Real McCoy&quot; portrayed McCoy&#x27;s life, the challenges he faced as an African American, and the development of his inventions. It was first produced in Toronto and has also been produced in the United States, for example in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 2011, where it was performed by the Black Rep Theatre.
*In her 2001 novel &quot;Noughts &amp; Crosses&quot;, Malorie Blackman describes a racial dystopia in which the roles of black and white people are reversed; Elijah McCoy is among the black scientists, inventors, and pioneers mentioned in a history class that Blackman &quot;never learned about in school&quot;.
*A 1945 song by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it Kinda Fun&quot;, from the musical &quot;State Fair&quot;, includes the lyrical phrase &quot;...this is the real McCoy.&quot;

== Legacy ==

* In 1974, the state of Michigan put a historical marker (P25170) at the McCoys&#x27; former home at 5720 Lincoln Avenue, and at his gravesite.
* In 1975, Detroit celebrated Elijah McCoy Day by placing a historic marker at the site of his home. The city also named a nearby street for him.
* In 1994, Michigan installed a historical marker (S0642) at his first workshop in Ypsilanti, Michigan.
* In 2001, McCoy was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in Alexandria, Virginia.
* In 2012, The &quot;Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional U.S. Patent and Trademark Office&quot; (the first USPTO satellite office) was opened in Detroit, Michigan.
* In 2022, a Google Doodle appeared in Canada and the U.S. marking his 178th birthday on May 2.

<text>MPEG-7 is a multimedia content description standard. It was standardized in ISO/IEC 15938 (Multimedia content description interface). This description will be associated with the content itself, to allow fast and efficient searching for material that is of interest to the user. MPEG-7 is formally called &quot;Multimedia Content Description Interface&quot;. Thus, it is &quot;not&quot; a standard which deals with the actual encoding of moving pictures and audio, like MPEG-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4. It uses XML to store metadata, and can be attached to timecode in order to tag particular events, or synchronise lyrics to a song, for example.

It was designed to standardize:
* a set of Description Schemes (&quot;DS&quot;) and Descriptors (&quot;D&quot;)
* a language to specify these schemes, called the Description Definition Language (&quot;DDL&quot;)
* a scheme for coding the description

The combination of MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 has been sometimes referred to as MPEG-47.

==Introduction==

MPEG-7 is intended to complement the previous MPEG standards, by standardizing multimedia metadata -- information about the content, not the content itself. MPEG-7 can be used independently of the other MPEG standards - the description might even be attached to an analog movie. The representation that is defined within MPEG-4, i.e. the representation of audio-visual data in terms of objects, is however very well suited to what will be built on the MPEG-7 standard. This representation is basic to the process of categorization. In addition, MPEG-7 descriptions could be used to improve the functionality of previous MPEG standards. With these tools, we can build an MPEG-7 Description and deploy it. According to the requirements document,1 &quot;a Description consists of a Description Scheme (structure) and the
set of Descriptor Values (instantiations) that
describe the Data.&quot; A Descriptor Value is &quot;an instantiation of a Descriptor for a given data set (or subset thereof).&quot;
The Descriptor is the syntactic and semantic definition of the content.
Extraction algorithms are inside the scope of the standard because their standardization is not required to allow interoperability.

==Parts==
The MPEG-7 (ISO/IEC 15938) consists of different Parts. Each part covers a certain aspect of the whole specification.
==Relation between description and content==

An MPEG-7 architecture requirement is that description must be separate from the audiovisual content.

On the other hand, there must be a relation between the content and description. Thus the description is multiplexed with the content itself.

On the right side you can see this relation between description and content.

==MPEG-7 tools==
MPEG-7 uses the following tools:

* Descriptor (D): It is a representation of a feature defined syntactically and semantically. It could be that a unique object was described by several descriptors.
* Description Schemes (DS): Specify the structure and semantics of the relations between its components, these components can be descriptors (D) or description schemes (DS).
* Description Definition Language (DDL): It is based on XML language used to define the structural relations between descriptors. It allows the creation and modification of description schemes and also the creation of new descriptors (D).
* System tools: These tools deal with binarization, synchronization, transport and storage of descriptors. It also deals with Intellectual Property protection.

On the right side you can see the relation between MPEG-7 tools.

==MPEG-7 applications==
There are many applications and application domains which will benefit from the MPEG-7 standard. A few application examples are:

* Digital library: Image/video catalogue, musical dictionary. 
* Multimedia directory services: e.g. yellow pages. 
* Broadcast media selection: Radio channel, TV channel. 
* Multimedia editing: Personalized electronic news service, media authoring.
* Security services: Traffic control, production chains...
* E-business: Searching process of products.
* Cultural services: Art-galleries, museums...
* Educational applications.
* Biomedical applications.
* Intelligent multimedia applications that leverage low-level multimedia semantics via formal representation and automated reasoning.

==See also==
* Exif
* ID3
* Metadata standards
* MPEG-4 Part 11 – Scene description and application engine
* Multimedia information retrieval
* Query by humming

==Limitations==

The MPEG-7 standard was originally written in XML Schema (XSD), which constitutes semi-structured data. For example, the running time of a movie annotated using MPEG-7 in XML is machine-readable data, so software agents will know that the number expressing the running time is a positive integer, but such data is not machine-interpretable (cannot be understood by agents), because it does not convey semantics (meaning), known as the &quot;Semantic Gap.&quot; To address this issue, there were many attempts to map the MPEG-7 XML Schema to the Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is a structured data equivalent of the terms of the MPEG-7 standard (MPEG-7Ontos, COMM, SWIntO, etc.). However, these mappings did not really bridge the &quot;Semantic Gap,&quot; because low-level video features alone are inadequate for representing video semantics. In other words, annotating an automatically extracted video feature, such as color distribution, does not provide the meaning of the actual visual content.

<text>Väinö Linna (; 20 December 1920 – 21 April 1992) was a Finnish author and a former soldier who fought in the Continuation War (1941–44). Linna gained literary fame with his third novel, &quot;Tuntematon sotilas&quot; (&quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, published in 1954), and consolidated his position with the trilogy &quot;Täällä Pohjantähden alla&quot; (&quot;Under the North Star&quot;, published in 1959–1963 and translated into English by Richard Impola). Both have been adapted to a film format on several occasions; &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; was first adapted into a film in 1955 and &quot;Under the North Star&quot; in 1968 as &quot;Here, Beneath the North Star&quot;, both directed by Edvin Laine.

==Biography==
Väinö Linna was born in Urjala in the Pirkanmaa region. He was the seventh child of Viktor (Vihtori) Linna (1874–1928) and Johanna Maria (Maija) Linna (1888–1972). Linna&#x27;s father, a butcher, died when Linna was only seven years old, thus Linna&#x27;s mother had to support the entire family by working at a nearby manor. Despite his background, Linna&#x27;s interest in literature began early on. As a child, Linna loved adventure novels which he borrowed from the local library. The author&#x27;s education was, however, limited to six years at a public school which he finished in the mid-1930s. After working as a lumberjack and a farm hand at the same manor where his mother had worked, Linna moved to Tampere in 1938. Typical of his generation, the adolescent author-to-be moved from the countryside to a developing city in search of industrial labour which he found at the Finlayson textile mills.

In 1940, Linna was conscripted into the army. The Second World War had broken out, and for Linna&#x27;s part it meant participation in the Continuation War (1941–44). He fought on the eastern front. In addition to being a squad-leader, he wrote notes and observations about his and his unit&#x27;s experiences. Already at this point Linna knew that writing would be his preferred occupation. However, failure to get the notes published led him to burn them. In spite of rejection, the idea of a novel, which would depict ordinary soldiers&#x27; views on war, would later lead him to write &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;.

After the war, Linna got married and started writing while working at the mills during the day. Throughout his time at Finlayson, Väinö Linna read avidly. Such authors as Schopenhauer, Dostoyevsky, and Nietzsche gained Linna&#x27;s respect. Linna later said that Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; had also had a great influence on him. However, Linna&#x27;s first two novels &quot;Päämäärä&quot; and &quot;Musta rakkaus&quot; sold poorly; he also wrote poetry but did not enjoy success with that either. Not until the release of &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; (1954) did he rise to fame. It is evident that at the time there was a distinct social need for a novel that would deal with the war and ordinary people&#x27;s role in it. A decade after the peace treaty with the Soviet Union many Finns were ready to reminisce, some even in a critical manner. &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; satisfied that need completely, as its characters were unarguably more diverse, realistic yet heroic, than those of earlier Finnish war novels. The book soon became something of a best-seller, as it sold 175,000 copies in only six months – quite a lot for a Finnish novel in the 1950s. 

Early on, the reception of the book was harsh. In Finland&#x27;s biggest newspaper, &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot;, the critic Toini Havu argued in her review that Linna did not present his characters in a grand historical and ethical context, which she thought was crucial. Also modernists treated &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; with contempt. At the time Tuomas Anhava referred to &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot; as a &quot;boy&#x27;s book&quot; because of its action-packed storyline. Acceptance by the general public was enough to counter the negative criticism in the end. The novel is now considered both a classic in Finnish literature and a part of the national legacy.

In the mid-1950s, he moved to Hämeenkyrö and began to cultivate crops. In 1959, the first part of &quot;Under the North Star&quot; was released. The book was a success and other parts were to follow. The second part was published in 1960 and the final part in 1963. The third part of the novel was honoured with the Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize. In 1964, Linna sold the farm and moved back to Tampere. This time he did not return to Finlayson, as he now could dedicate his life entirely to literature due to the financial success his works had earned him. He was given the honorary title of academician in 1980, despite the fact that he had no higher education.

In 1984, Väinö Linna had a stroke, which caused him to lose the ability to speak. Some time after that, he was diagnosed with cancer, which tired him out, leading to his death on 21 April 1992.

==Legacy==
Linna&#x27;s realism of his work has had a profound influence on Finnish social, political and cultural life. His novels have a place in Finland&#x27;s literary canon, among &quot;Kalevala&quot;, &quot;Seven Brothers&quot; and other classics. Many quotations from his works are nowadays Finnish sayings. The opening line of &quot;Under the North Star&quot;, &quot;In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe – and Jussi&quot;, is recognized by most Finns as well as Rokka&#x27;s famous exclamation, &quot;Where do you need a real good man, here you have one!&quot;, from &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;. Showcasing the value of his legacy, Linna was pictured on the 20 markka banknote which was in use from 1993 to the introduction of the Euro. In addition, both of his major works have been filmed multiple times.

In 1995, a square of the same name was named after Väinö Linna in Tampere.

<doc id="185229" wikidata="Q841238" url="?curid=185229" title="Chaconne">
<text>A chaconne ( , ; ; ; earlier English: chacony) is a type of musical composition often used as a vehicle for variation on a repeated short harmonic progression, often involving a fairly short repetitive bass-line (ground bass) which offers a compositional outline for variation, decoration, figuration and melodic invention. In this it closely resembles the passacaglia. It originates and was particularly popular in the Baroque era; a large number of Chaconnes exist from the 17th and 18th centuries.

The ground bass, if there is one, may typically descend stepwise from the tonic to the dominant pitch of the scale; the harmonies given to the upper parts may emphasize the circle of fifths or a derivative pattern thereof.

==History==

Though it originally emerged during the late sixteenth century in Spanish culture, having reputedly been introduced from the New World, as a quick dance-song characterized by suggestive movements and mocking texts, the chaconne by the early eighteenth century had evolved into a slow triple meter instrumental form.

Alex Ross describes the origins of the &quot;chacona&quot; as actually having been a sexily swirling dance that appeared in South America at the end of the sixteenth century and quickly spread to Europe. The dance became popular both in the elite courts and in the general population. &quot;Un sarao de la chacona&quot; is one of the earliest known examples of a &quot;chacona&quot;, written down by Spanish musician Juan Arañés.

Outstanding examples of early baroque chaconnes are Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Zefiro torna&quot; and &quot;Es steh Gott auf&quot; by Heinrich Schütz.

One of the best known and most masterful and expressive examples of the chaconne is the final movement from the Violin Partita in D minor by Johann Sebastian Bach. This 256-measure chaconne takes a plaintive four-bar phrase through a continuous kaleidoscope of musical expression in both major and minor modes. However, recently it has been proposed that Bach&#x27;s &quot;Ciaccona&quot; (he used the Italian form of the name, rather than the French &quot;Chaconne&quot;) is really cast in the form of a French theatrical dance known as the &quot;passacaille&quot;, although it also incorporates Italian and German style features as well.

After the Baroque period, the chaconne fell into decline during the 19th century, though the 32 Variations in C minor by Beethoven suggest its continuing influence. However, the form saw a very substantial revival during the 20th century, with more than two dozen composers contributing examples (see below).

==Chaconne and passacaglia==

The chaconne has been understood by some nineteenth and early twentieth-century theorists to be a set of variations on a harmonic progression, as opposed to a set of variations on a melodic bass pattern (to which is assigned the term &quot;passacaglia&quot;), while other theorists of the same period make the distinction the other way around. In actual usage in music history, the term &quot;chaconne&quot; has not been so clearly distinguished from passacaglia as regards the way the given piece of music is constructed, and &quot;modern attempts to arrive at a clear distinction are arbitrary and historically unfounded.&quot; In fact, the two genres were sometimes combined in a single composition, as in the &quot;Cento partite sopra passacagli&quot;, from &quot;Toccate d’intavolatura di cimbalo et organo, partite di diverse arie ...&quot; (1637), by Girolamo Frescobaldi, and the first suite of &quot;Les Nations&quot; (1726) as well as in the &quot;Pièces de Violes&quot; (1728) by François Couperin.

Frescobaldi, who was probably the first composer to treat the chaconne and passacaglia comparatively, usually (but not always) sets the former in major key, with two compound triple-beat groups per variation, giving his chaconne a more propulsive forward motion than his passacaglia, which usually has four simple triple-beat groups per variation. Both are usually in triple meter, begin on the second beat of the bar, and have a theme of four measures (or a close multiple thereof). (In more recent times the chaconne, like the passacaglia, need not be in time; see, for instance, Francesco Tristano Schlimé&#x27;s Chaconne/Ground Bass, where every section is built on seven-beats patterns)

<doc id="185232" wikidata="Q11116" url="?curid=185232" title="Ruth Bader Ginsburg">
<text>Joan Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( ; Bader; March 15, 1933 – September 18, 2020) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 until her death in 2020. She was nominated by President Bill Clinton to replace retiring justice Byron White, and at the time was viewed as a moderate consensus-builder. Ginsburg was the first Jewish woman and the second woman to serve on the Court, after Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. During her tenure, Ginsburg authored the majority opinions in cases such as &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;(1996), &quot;Olmstead v. L.C.&quot;(1999), &quot;Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.&quot;(2000), and &quot;City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York&quot;(2005). Later in her tenure, Ginsburg received attention for passionate dissents that reflected liberal views of the law. She was popularly dubbed &quot;the Notorious R.B.G.&quot;, a moniker she later embraced.

Ginsburg was born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Just over a year later her older sister and only sibling, Marilyn, died of meningitis at the age of six. Her mother died shortly before she graduated from high school. She earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree at Cornell University and married Martin D. Ginsburg, becoming a mother before starting law school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School, where she graduated joint first in her class. During the early 1960s she worked with the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, learned Swedish, and co-authored a book with Swedish jurist Anders Bruzelius; her work in Sweden profoundly influenced her thinking on gender equality. She then became a professor at Rutgers Law School and Columbia Law School, teaching civil procedure as one of the few women in her field.

Ginsburg spent much of her legal career as an advocate for gender equality and women&#x27;s rights, winning many arguments before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general counsel in the 1970s. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where she served until her appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993. Between O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s retirement in 2006 and the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, she was the only female justice on the Supreme Court. During that time, Ginsburg became more forceful with her dissents, such as with &quot;Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.&quot;(2007).

Despite two bouts with cancer and public pleas from liberal law scholars, she decided not to retire in 2013 or 2014 when President Barack Obama and a Democratic-controlled Senate could appoint and confirm her successor. Ginsburg died at her home in Washington, D.C., in September 2020, at the age of 87, from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The vacancy created by her death was filled days later by Amy Coney Barrett. The result was one of three major rightward shifts in the Court since 1953, following the appointment of Clarence Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall in 1991 and the appointment of Warren Burger to replace Earl Warren in 1969.

==Early life and education==

Joan Ruth Bader was born on March 15, 1933, at Beth Moses Hospital in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, the second daughter of Celia (née Amster) and Nathan Bader, who lived in Brooklyn&#x27;s Flatbush neighborhood. Her father was a Jewish emigrant from Odesa, Ukraine, at that time part of the Russian Empire, and her mother was born in New York to Jewish parents who came from Kraków, Poland, at that time part of Austria-Hungary. The Baders&#x27; elder daughter Marylin died of meningitis at age six. Joan, who was 14 months old when Marylin died, was known to the family as &quot;Kiki&quot;, a nickname Marylin had given her for being &quot;a kicky baby&quot;. When Joan started school, Celia discovered that her daughter&#x27;s class had several other girls named Joan, so Celia suggested the teacher call her daughter by her second name, Ruth, to avoid confusion. Although not devout, the Bader family belonged to East Midwood Jewish Center, a Conservative synagogue, where Ruth learned tenets of the Jewish faith and gained familiarity with the Hebrew language. Ruth was not allowed to have a bat mitzvah ceremony because of Orthodox restrictions on women reading from the Torah, which upset her. Starting as a camper from the age of four, she attended Camp Che-Na-Wah, a Jewish summer program at Lake Balfour near Minerva, New York, where she was later a camp counselor until the age of eighteen.

Celia took an active role in her daughter&#x27;s education, often taking her to the library. Celia had been a good student in her youth, graduating from high school at age 15, yet she could not further her own education because her family instead chose to send her brother to college. Celia wanted her daughter to get more education, which she thought would allow Ruth to become a high school history teacher. Ruth attended James Madison High School, whose law program later dedicated a courtroom in her honor. Celia struggled with cancer throughout Ruth&#x27;s high school years and died the day before Ruth&#x27;s high school graduation.

Ruth Bader attended Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where she was a member of Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. While at Cornell, she met Martin D. Ginsburg at age 17. She graduated from Cornell with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government on June 23, 1954. While at Cornell, Bader studied under Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov, and she later identified Nabokov as a major influence on her development as a writer. She was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the highest-ranking female student in her graduating class. Bader married Ginsburg a month after her graduation from Cornell. The couple moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where Martin Ginsburg, a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps graduate, was stationed as a called-up active duty United States Army Reserve officer during the Korean War. At age 21, Ruth Bader Ginsburg worked for the Social Security Administration office in Oklahoma, where she was demoted after becoming pregnant with her first child. She gave birth to a daughter in 1955.

In the fall of 1956, Ruth Bader Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law School, where she was one of only 9 women in a class of about 500 men. The dean of Harvard Law, Erwin Griswold, reportedly invited all the female law students to dinner at his family home and asked the female law students, including Ginsburg, &quot;Why are you at Harvard Law School, taking the place of a man?&quot; When her husband took a job in New York City, that same dean denied Ginsburg&#x27;s request to complete her third year towards a Harvard law degree at Columbia Law School, so Ginsburg transferred to Columbia and became the first woman to be on two major law reviews: the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and &quot;Columbia Law Review&quot;. In 1959, she earned her law degree at Columbia and tied for first in her class.

==Early career==

At the start of her legal career, Ginsburg encountered difficulty in finding employment. In 1960, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter rejected Ginsburg for a clerkship because of her gender. He did so despite a strong recommendation from Albert Martin Sacks, who was a professor and later dean of Harvard Law School. Columbia law professor Gerald Gunther also pushed for Judge Edmund L. Palmieri of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to hire Ginsburg as a law clerk, threatening to never recommend another Columbia student to Palmieri if he did not give Ginsburg the opportunity and guaranteeing to provide the judge with a replacement clerk should Ginsburg not succeed. Later that year, Ginsburg began her clerkship for Judge Palmieri, and she held the position for two years.

===Academia===

From 1961 to 1963, Ginsburg was a research associate and then an associate director of the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, working alongside director Hans Smit; she learned Swedish to co-author a book with Anders Bruzelius on civil procedure in Sweden. Ginsburg conducted extensive research for her book at Lund University in Sweden. Ginsburg&#x27;s time in Sweden and her association with the Swedish Bruzelius family of jurists also influenced her thinking on gender equality. She was inspired when she observed the changes in Sweden, where women were 20 to 25 percent of all law students; one of the judges whom Ginsburg observed for her research was eight months pregnant and still working. Bruzelius&#x27; daughter, Norwegian supreme court justice and president of the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights, Karin M. Bruzelius, herself a law student when Ginsburg worked with her father, said that &quot;by getting close to my family, Ruth realized that one could live in a completely different way, that women could have a different lifestyle and legal position than what they had in the United States.&quot;

Ginsburg&#x27;s first position as a professor was at Rutgers Law School in 1963. She was paid less than her male colleagues because, she was told, &quot;your husband has a very good job.&quot; At the time Ginsburg entered academia, she was one of fewer than twenty female law professors in the United States. She was a professor of law at Rutgers from 1963 to 1972, teaching mainly civil procedure and receiving tenure in 1969.

In 1970, she co-founded the &quot;Women&#x27;s Rights Law Reporter&quot;, the first law journal in the U.S. to focus exclusively on women&#x27;s rights. From 1972 to 1980, she taught at Columbia Law School, becoming its first tenured woman. At Columbia, she co-authored the first law school casebook on sex discrimination and taught the first legal seminar on sex discrimination. She also spent a year as a fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University from 1977 to 1978.

===Litigation and advocacy===

In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women&#x27;s Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and in 1973, she became the Project&#x27;s general counsel. The Women&#x27;s Rights Project and related ACLU projects participated in more than 300 gender discrimination cases by 1974. As the director of the ACLU&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Rights Project, she argued six gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court between 1973 and 1976, winning five. Rather than asking the Court to end all gender discrimination at once, Ginsburg charted a strategic course, taking aim at specific discriminatory statutes and building on each successive victory. She chose plaintiffs carefully, at times picking male plaintiffs to demonstrate that gender discrimination was harmful to both men and women. The laws Ginsburg targeted included those that on the surface appeared beneficial to women, but in fact reinforced the notion that women needed to be dependent on men. Her strategic advocacy extended to word choice, favoring the use of &quot;gender&quot; instead of &quot;sex&quot;, after her secretary suggested the word &quot;sex&quot; would serve as a distraction to judges. She attained a reputation as a skilled oral advocate, and her work led directly to the end of gender discrimination in many areas of the law.

Ginsburg volunteered to write the brief for &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot;, , in which the Supreme Court extended the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women. In 1972, she argued before the 10th Circuit in &quot;Moritz v. Commissioner&quot; on behalf of a man who had been denied a caregiver deduction because of his gender. As &quot;amicus&quot; she argued in &quot;Frontiero v. Richardson&quot;, , which challenged a statute making it more difficult for a female service member (Frontiero) to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued that the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in Frontiero&#x27;s favor. The court again ruled in Ginsburg&#x27;s favor in &quot;Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld&quot;, , where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued that the statute discriminated against male survivors of workers by denying them the same protection as their female counterparts.

In 1973, the same year &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was decided, Ginsburg filed a federal case to challenge involuntary sterilization, suing members of the Eugenics Board of North Carolina on behalf of Nial Ruth Cox, a mother who had been coercively sterilized under North Carolina&#x27;s Sterilization of Persons Mentally Defective program on penalty of her family losing welfare benefits. During a 2009 interview with Emily Bazelon of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ginsburg stated: &quot;I had thought that at the time &quot;Roe&quot; was decided, there was concern about population growth and particularly growth in populations that we don&#x27;t want to have too many of.&quot; Bazelon conducted a follow-up interview with Ginsburg in 2012 at a joint appearance at Yale University, where Ginsburg claimed her 2009 quote was vastly misinterpreted and clarified her stance.

Ginsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for &quot;Craig v. Boren&quot;, , which challenged an Oklahoma statute that set different minimum drinking ages for men and women. For the first time, the court imposed what is known as intermediate scrutiny on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review. Her last case as an attorney before the Supreme Court was &quot;Duren v. Missouri&quot;, , which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women, on the ground that participation in jury duty was a citizen&#x27;s vital governmental service and therefore should not be optional for women. At the end of Ginsburg&#x27;s oral argument, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, &quot;You won&#x27;t settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?&quot; Ginsburg said she considered responding, &quot;We won&#x27;t settle for tokens,&quot; but instead opted not to answer the question.

Legal scholars and advocates credit Ginsburg&#x27;s body of work with making significant legal advances for women under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Taken together, Ginsburg&#x27;s legal victories discouraged legislatures from treating women and men differently under the law. She continued to work on the ACLU&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Rights Project until her appointment to the Federal Bench in 1980. Later, colleague Antonin Scalia praised Ginsburg&#x27;s skills as an advocate. &quot;She became the leading (and very successful) litigator on behalf of women&#x27;s rights—the Thurgood Marshall of that cause, so to speak.&quot; This was a comparison that had first been made by former solicitor general Erwin Griswold who was also her former professor and dean at Harvard Law School, in a speech given in 1985.

==U.S. Court of Appeals==
In light of the mounting backlog in the federal judiciary, Congress passed the Omnibus Judgeship Act of 1978 increasing the number of federal judges by 117 in district courts and another 35 to be added to the circuit courts. The law placed an emphasis on ensuring that the judges included women and minority groups, a matter that was important to President Jimmy Carter who had been elected two years before. The bill also required that the nomination process consider the character and experience of the candidates. Ginsburg was considering a change in career as soon as Carter was elected. She was interviewed by the Department of Justice to become Solicitor General, the position she most desired, but knew that she and the African-American candidate who was interviewed the same day had little chance of being appointed by Attorney General Griffin Bell.
At the time, Ginsburg was a fellow at Stanford University where she was working on a written account of her work in litigation and advocacy for equal rights. Her husband was a visiting professor at Stanford Law School and was ready to leave his firm, Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, for a tenured position. He was at the same time working hard to promote a possible judgeship for his wife. In January 1979, she filled out the questionnaire for possible nominees to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and another for the District of Columbia Circuit. Ginsburg was nominated by President Carter on April 14, 1980, to a seat on the DC Circuit vacated by Judge Harold Leventhal upon his death. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 18, 1980, and received her commission later that day.

During her time as a judge on the DC Circuit, Ginsburg often found consensus with her colleagues including conservatives Robert H. Bork and Antonin Scalia. Her time on the court earned her a reputation as a &quot;cautious jurist&quot; and a moderate. Her service ended on August 9, 1993, due to her elevation to the United States Supreme Court, and she was replaced by Judge David S. Tatel.

==Supreme Court==
===Nomination and confirmation===
President Bill Clinton nominated Ginsburg as an associate justice of the Supreme Court on June 22, 1993, to fill the seat vacated by retiring justice Byron White. She was recommended to Clinton by then–U.S. attorney general Janet Reno, after a suggestion by Utah Republican senator Orrin Hatch. At the time of her nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as having been a moderate and a consensus-builder in her time on the appeals court. Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the Court&#x27;s diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas. She was the second female and the first Jewish female justice of the Supreme Court. She eventually became the longest-serving Jewish justice. The American Bar Association&#x27;s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as &quot;well qualified&quot;, its highest rating for a prospective justice.
During her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of the confirmation hearings, Ginsburg refused to answer questions about her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it was an issue she might have to vote on if it came before the Court.

At the same time, Ginsburg did answer questions about some potentially controversial issues. For instance, she affirmed her belief in a constitutional right to privacy and explained at some length her personal judicial philosophy and thoughts regarding gender equality. Ginsburg was more forthright in discussing her views on topics about which she had previously written. The United States Senate confirmed her by a 96–3 vote on August 3, 1993. She received her commission on August 5, 1993 and took her judicial oath on August 10, 1993.

Ginsburg&#x27;s name was later invoked during the confirmation process of John Roberts. Ginsburg was not the first nominee to avoid answering certain specific questions before Congress, and as a young attorney in 1981 Roberts had advised against Supreme Court nominees&#x27; giving specific responses. Nevertheless, some conservative commentators and senators invoked the phrase &quot;Ginsburg precedent&quot; to defend his demurrers. In a September 28, 2005, speech at Wake Forest University, Ginsburg said Roberts&#x27;s refusal to answer questions during his Senate confirmation hearings on some cases was &quot;unquestionably right&quot;.

===Supreme Court tenure===
Ginsburg characterized her performance on the Court as a cautious approach to adjudication. She argued in a speech shortly before her nomination to the Court that &quot;[m]easured motions seem to me right, in the main, for constitutional as well as common law adjudication. Doctrinal limbs too swiftly shaped, experience teaches, may prove unstable.&quot; Legal scholar Cass Sunstein characterized Ginsburg as a &quot;rational minimalist&quot;, a jurist who seeks to build cautiously on precedent rather than pushing the Constitution towards her own vision.

The retirement of Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in 2006 left Ginsburg as the only woman on the Court. Linda Greenhouse of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the subsequent 2006–2007 term of the Court as &quot;the time when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg found her voice, and used it&quot;. The term also marked the first time in Ginsburg&#x27;s history with the Court where she read multiple dissents from the bench, a tactic employed to signal more intense disagreement with the majority.
With the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, Ginsburg became the senior member of what was sometimes referred to as the Court&#x27;s &quot;liberal wing&quot;. When the Court split 5–4 along ideological lines and the liberal justices were in the minority, Ginsburg often had the authority to assign authorship of the dissenting opinion because of her seniority. Ginsburg was a proponent of the liberal dissenters speaking &quot;with one voice&quot; and, where practicable, presenting a unified approach to which all the dissenting justices can agree.

During Ginsburg&#x27;s entire Supreme Court tenure from 1993 to 2020, she only hired one African-American clerk (Paul J. Watford). During her 13 years on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, she never hired an African-American clerk, intern, or secretary. The lack of diversity was briefly an issue during her 1993 confirmation hearing. When this issue was raised by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ginsburg stated that &quot;If you confirm me for this job, my attractiveness to black candidates is going to improve.&quot; This issue received renewed attention after more than a hundred of her former legal clerks served as pallbearers during her funeral.

====Gender discrimination====

Ginsburg authored the Court&#x27;s opinion in &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;, , which struck down the Virginia Military Institute&#x27;s (VMI) male-only admissions policy as violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. For Ginsburg, a state actor could not use gender to deny women equal protection; therefore VMI must allow women the opportunity to attend VMI with its unique educational methods. Ginsburg emphasized that the government must show an &quot;exceedingly persuasive justification&quot; to use a classification based on sex. VMI proposed a separate institute for women, but Ginsburg found this solution reminiscent of the effort by Texas decades earlier to preserve the University of Texas Law School for Whites by establishing a separate school for Blacks.

Ginsburg dissented in the Court&#x27;s decision on &quot;Ledbetter v. Goodyear&quot;, , in which plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter sued her employer, claiming pay discrimination based on her gender, in violation of TitleVII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In a 5–4 decision, the majority interpreted the statute of limitations as starting to run at the time of every pay period, even if a woman did not know she was being paid less than her male colleague until later. Ginsburg found the result absurd, pointing out that women often do not know they are being paid less, and therefore it was unfair to expect them to act at the time of each paycheck. She also called attention to the reluctance women may have in male-dominated fields to making waves by filing lawsuits over small amounts, choosing instead to wait until the disparity accumulates. As part of her dissent, Ginsburg called on Congress to amend TitleVII to undo the Court&#x27;s decision with legislation. Following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, making it easier for employees to win pay discrimination claims, became law. Ginsburg was credited with helping to inspire the law.

====Abortion rights====

Ginsburg discussed her views on abortion and gender equality in a 2009 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, in which she said, &quot;[t]he basic thing is that the government has no business making that choice for a woman.&quot; Although Ginsburg consistently supported abortion rights and joined in the Court&#x27;s opinion striking down Nebraska&#x27;s partial-birth abortion law in &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;, , on the 40th anniversary of the Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, , she criticized the decision in &quot;Roe&quot; as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.
Ginsburg was in the minority for &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, , a 5–4 decision upholding restrictions on partial birth abortion. In her dissent, Ginsburg opposed the majority&#x27;s decision to defer to legislative findings that the procedure was not safe for women. Ginsburg focused her ire on the way Congress reached its findings and with their veracity. Joining the majority for &quot;Whole Woman&#x27;s Health v. Hellerstedt&quot;, , a case which struck down parts of a 2013 Texas law regulating abortion providers, Ginsburg also authored a short concurring opinion which was even more critical of the legislation at issue. She asserted the legislation was not aimed at protecting women&#x27;s health, as Texas had said, but rather to impede women&#x27;s access to abortions.

====Religious Freedom====
On May 31, 2005, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in Cutter v. Wilkinson that facilities utilizing federal funds cannot deny prisoners accommodations necessary for the practice of their religious beliefs. In doing so, Ginsburg held that RLUIPA was a valid accommodation permitted by the First Amendment&#x27;s Establishment Clause. In addition, Ginsburg acknowledged that the free exercise of religion encompasses both belief and action but noted that accommodation of a religious belief did not predispose equal accommodation for a non-secular preference.

On June 28, 2010, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez relating to a campus policy of acceptance of all students, regardless of status or belief, in becoming an officially recognized student group. Ginsburg ruled that a religious-based group stood at odds with an &quot;all-comers&quot; campus policy by singling out a religious group for exclusion in a manner at odds with the &quot;limited public forum&quot; of the campus. Such a public forum was thus legally obligated to provide equal access via open membership and was determined to not be required to officially recognize a student group at odds with it.

====Search and seizure====
On June 27, 2002, Ginsburg dissented in &quot;Board of Education v. Earls&quot; which permitted schools to enact mandatory drug testing on students partaking in extracurricular activities. In her dissent, Ginsburg criticized the application of such a policy when the district had failed to identify either a significant drug risk among the students or in the school. In doing so, Ginsburg contrasted the case with &quot;Vernonia School District v. Acton&quot; which had permitted drug testing due to &#x27;special needs&#x27; of athlete participation, acknowledging her prior agreement with the verdict but stating that such an opinion &quot;cannot be read to endorse invasive and suspicionless drug testing of all students&quot;.

Although Ginsburg did not author the majority opinion, she was credited with influencing her colleagues on &quot;Safford Unified School District v. Redding&quot;, , which held that a school went too far in ordering a 13-year-old female student to strip to her bra and underpants so female officials could search for drugs. In an interview published prior to the Court&#x27;s decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not fully appreciate the effect of a strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she said, &quot;They have never been a 13-year-old girl.&quot; In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school&#x27;s search violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student&#x27;s lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.

In &quot;Herring v. United States&quot;, , Ginsburg dissented from the Court&#x27;s decision not to suppress evidence due to a police officer&#x27;s failure to update a computer system. In contrast to Roberts&#x27;s emphasis on suppression as a means to deter police misconduct, Ginsburg took a more robust view on the use of suppression as a remedy for a violation of a defendant&#x27;s Fourth Amendment rights. Ginsburg viewed suppression as a way to prevent the government from profiting from mistakes, and therefore as a remedy to preserve judicial integrity and respect civil rights. She also rejected Roberts&#x27;s assertion that suppression would not deter mistakes, contending making police pay a high price for mistakes would encourage them to take greater care.

On January 26, 2009, Ginsburg wrote for a unanimous court in &quot;Arizona v. Johnson&quot; that a police officer may pat down an individual at a traffic stop provided reasonable suspicion by the officer the individual was armed and dangerous. In her opinion, Ginsburg concluded that the &quot;combined thrust&quot; of past opinions such as &quot;Terry v. Ohio&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania v. Mimms&quot; provided officers the authority to conduct such a search provided reasonable suspicion of danger by the individual. Additionally, Ginsburg noted that comments made by the officer unrelated to the traffic stop &quot;do not convert the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop&quot;.

On April 21, 2015, Ginsburg authored the majority opinion in &quot;Rodriguez v. United States&quot; stating that an officer may not extend the length of a standard traffic stop to conduct a search with a detection dog. In her opinion, Ginsburg stated that the use of a detection dog or any action not related to the initial traffic stop could not be used in suspicion of a separate crime. Ginsburg additionally contended that such an action would only be permissible by the officer provided the officer had &quot;independently supported reasonable suspicion&quot; that a separate crime had occurred at the time of the initial traffic violation and that the action taken would not add additional time to the traffic stop.

====International law====

Ginsburg advocated the use of foreign law and norms to shape U.S. law in judicial opinions, a view rejected by some of her conservative colleagues. Ginsburg supported using foreign interpretations of law for persuasive value and possible wisdom, not as binding precedent. Ginsburg expressed the view that consulting international law is a well-ingrained tradition in American law, counting John Henry Wigmore and President John Adams as internationalists. Ginsburg&#x27;s own reliance on international law dated back to her time as an attorney; in her first argument before the Court, &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot;, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), she cited two German cases. In her concurring opinion in &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), a decision upholding Michigan Law School&#x27;s affirmative action admissions policy, Ginsburg noted there was accord between the notion that affirmative action admissions policies would have an end point and agrees with international treaties designed to combat racial and gender-based discrimination.

====Voting rights and affirmative action====
In 2013, Ginsburg dissented in &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot;, in which the Court held unconstitutional the part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 requiring federal preclearance before changing voting practices. Ginsburg wrote, &quot;Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.&quot;

Besides &quot;Grutter&quot;, Ginsburg wrote in favor of affirmative action in her dissent in &quot;Gratz v. Bollinger&quot; (2003), in which the Court ruled an affirmative action policy unconstitutional because it was not narrowly tailored to the state&#x27;s interest in diversity. She argued that &quot;government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and inclusion...Actions designed to burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched discrimination and its after effects have been extirpated.&quot;

====Native Americans====
In 1997, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Strate v. A-1 Contractors&quot; against tribal jurisdiction over tribal-owned land in a reservation. The case involved a nonmember who caused a car crash in the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation. Ginsburg reasoned that the state right-of-way on which the crash occurred rendered the tribal-owned land equivalent to non-Indian land. She then considered the rule set in &quot;Montana v. United States&quot;, which allows tribes to regulate the activities of nonmembers who have a relationship with the tribe. Ginsburg noted that the driver&#x27;s employer did have a relationship with the tribe, but she reasoned that the tribe could not regulate their activities because the victim had no relationship to the tribe. Ginsburg concluded that although &quot;those who drive carelessly on a public highway running through a reservation endanger all in the vicinity, and surely jeopardize the safety of tribal members&quot;, having a nonmember go before an &quot;unfamiliar court&quot; was &quot;not crucial to the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the Three Affiliated Tribes&quot; (internal quotations and brackets omitted). The decision, by a unanimous Court, was generally criticized by scholars of Indian law, such as David Getches and Frank Pommersheim.

Later in 2005, Ginsburg cited the doctrine of discovery in the majority opinion of &quot;City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York&quot; and concluded that the Oneida Indian Nation could not revive its ancient sovereignty over its historic land. The discovery doctrine has been used to grant ownership of Native American lands to colonial governments. The Oneida had lived in towns, grew extensive crops, and maintained trade routes to the Gulf of Mexico. In her opinion for the Court, Ginsburg reasoned that the historic Oneida land had been &quot;converted from wilderness&quot; ever since it was dislodged from the Oneidas&#x27; possession. She also reasoned that &quot;the longstanding, distinctly non-Indian character of the area and its inhabitants&quot; and &quot;the regulatory authority constantly exercised by New York State and its counties and towns&quot; justified the ruling. Ginsburg also invoked, sua sponte, the doctrine of laches, reasoning that the Oneidas took a &quot;long delay in seeking judicial relief&quot;. She also reasoned that the dispossession of the Oneidas&#x27; land was &quot;ancient&quot;. Lower courts later relied on &quot;Sherrill&quot; as precedent to extinguish Native American land claims, including in &quot;Cayuga Indian Nation of New York v. Pataki&quot;.

Less than a year after &quot;Sherrill&quot;, Ginsburg offered a starkly contrasting approach to Native American law. In December 2005, Ginsburg dissented in &quot;Wagnon v. Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation&quot;, arguing that a state tax on fuel sold to Potawatomi retailers would impermissibly nullify the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation&#x27;s own tax authority. In 2008, when Ginsburg&#x27;s precedent in &quot;Strate&quot; was used in &quot;Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land &amp; Cattle Co.&quot;, she dissented in part and argued that the tribal court of the Cheyenne River Lakota Nation had jurisdiction over the case. In 2020, Ginsburg joined the ruling of &quot;McGirt v. Oklahoma&quot;, which affirmed Native American jurisdictions over reservations in much of Oklahoma.

====Other majority opinions====
In 1999, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Olmstead v. L.C.,&quot; in which the Court ruled that mental illness is a form of disability covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

In 2000, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc.&quot;, in which the Court held that residents have standing to seek fines for an industrial polluter that affected their interests and that is able to continue doing so.

===Decision not to retire under Obama===

When John Paul Stevens retired in 2010, Ginsburg became the oldest justice on the court at age 77. Despite rumors that she would retire because of advancing age, poor health, and the death of her husband, she denied she was planning to step down. In an interview in August 2010, Ginsburg said her work on the Court was helping her cope with the death of her husband. She also expressed a wish to emulate Justice Louis Brandeis&#x27;s service of nearly 23years, which she achieved in April 2016.

Several times during the presidency of Barack Obama, progressive attorneys and activists called for Ginsburg to retire so that Obama could appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate. Ginsburg reaffirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties. In 2013, Obama met with her in the White House to point out that Democrats might soon lose control of the Senate and nudge her toward stepping down, but she again refused. She opined that Republicans would use the judicial filibuster to prevent Obama from appointing a jurist like herself. She stated that she had a new model to emulate in her former colleague, Justice John Paul Stevens, who retired at the age of 90 after nearly 35 years on the bench.

Lawyer and author Linda Hirshman believed that, in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Ginsburg was waiting for candidate Hillary Clinton to beat candidate Donald Trump before retiring, because Clinton would nominate a more liberal successor for her than Obama would, or so that her successor could be nominated by the first female president. After Trump&#x27;s victory in 2016 and the election of a Republican Senate, she would have had to wait until at least 2021 for a Democrat to be president, but died in office in September 2020 at age 87.

==Other activities==

At his request, Ginsburg administered the oath of office to Vice President Al Gore for a second term during the second inauguration of Bill Clinton on January 20, 1997. She was the third woman to administer an inaugural oath of office. Ginsburg is believed to have been the first Supreme Court justice to officiate at a same-sex wedding, performing the August 31, 2013, ceremony of Kennedy Center president Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist. Earlier that summer, the Court had bolstered same-sex marriage rights in two separate cases. Ginsburg believed the issue being settled led same-sex couples to ask her to officiate as there was no longer the fear of compromising rulings on the issue.

The Supreme Court bar formerly inscribed its certificates &quot;in the year of our Lord&quot;, which some Orthodox Jews opposed, and asked Ginsburg to object to. She did so, and due to her objection, Supreme Court bar members have since been given other choices of how to inscribe the year on their certificates.

Despite their ideological differences, Ginsburg considered Antonin Scalia her closest colleague on the Court. The two justices often dined together and attended the opera. In addition to befriending modern composers, including Tobias Picker, in her spare time, Ginsburg appeared in several operas in non-speaking supernumerary roles such as &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (2003) and &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; (1994 and 2009 with Scalia), and spoke lines penned by herself in &quot;The Daughter of the Regiment&quot; (2016).

In January 2012, Ginsburg went to Egypt for four days of discussions with judges, law school faculty, law school students, and legal experts. In an interview with Al Hayat TV, she said the first requirement of a new constitution should be that it would &quot;safeguard basic fundamental human rights like our First Amendment&quot;. Asked if Egypt should model its new constitution on those of other nations, she said Egypt should be &quot;aided by all Constitution-writing that has gone on since the end of World WarII&quot;, and cited the United States Constitution and Constitution of South Africa as documents she might look to if drafting a new constitution. She said the U.S. was fortunate to have a constitution authored by &quot;very wise&quot; men but said that in the 1780s, no women were able to participate directly in the process, and slavery still existed in the U.S.

During three interviews in July 2016, Ginsburg criticized presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the Associated Press that she did not want to think about the possibility of a Trump presidency. She joked that she might consider moving to New Zealand. She later apologized for commenting on the presumptive Republican nominee, calling her remarks &quot;ill advised&quot;.

Ginsburg&#x27;s first book, &quot;My Own Words&quot;, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster on October 4, 2016. The book debuted on The &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller List for hardcover nonfiction at No.12. While promoting her book in October 2016 during an interview with Katie Couric, Ginsburg responded to a question about Colin Kaepernick choosing not to stand for the national anthem at sporting events by calling the protest &quot;really dumb&quot;. She later apologized for her criticism calling her earlier comments &quot;inappropriately dismissive and harsh&quot; and noting she had not been familiar with the incident and should have declined to respond to the question. In 2021, Couric revealed that she had edited out some statements by Ginsburg in their interview; Ginsburg said that athletes who protested by not standing were showing &quot;contempt for a government that has made it possible for their parents and grandparents to live a decent life... which they probably could not have lived in the places they came from.&quot;

In 2017, Ginsburg gave the keynote address to a Georgetown University symposium on governmental reform. She spoke on the need for improving the confirmation process, &quot;recall[ing] the &#x27;collegiality&#x27; and &#x27;civility&#x27; of her own nomination and confirmation...&quot;

In 2018, Ginsburg expressed her support for the MeToo movement, which encourages women to speak up about their experiences with sexual harassment. She told an audience, &quot;It&#x27;s about time. For so long women were silent, thinking there was nothing you could do about it, but now the law is on the side of women, or men, who encounter harassment and that&#x27;s a good thing.&quot; She also reflected on her own experiences with gender discrimination and sexual harassment, including a time when a chemistry professor at Cornell unsuccessfully attempted to trade her exam answers for sex.

==Personal life==

A few days after Ruth Bader graduated from Cornell, she married Martin D. Ginsburg, who later became an internationally prominent tax attorney practicing at Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges. Upon Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#x27;s accession to the D.C. Circuit, the couple moved from New York City to Washington, D.C., where Martin became a professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Jane C. Ginsburg (born 1955), is a professor at Columbia Law School. Their son, James Steven Ginsburg (born 1965), is the founder and president of Cedille Records, a classical music recording company based in Chicago, Illinois. Martin and Ruth had four grandchildren.

After the birth of their daughter, Martin was diagnosed with testicular cancer. During this period, Ruth attended class and took notes for both of them, typing her husband&#x27;s dictated papers and caring for their daughter and her sick husband. During this period, she also was selected to be a member of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. Martin died of complications from metastatic cancer on June 27, 2010, four days after their 56th wedding anniversary. They spoke publicly of being in a shared earning/shared parenting marriage including in a speech Martin wrote and had intended to give before his death that Ruth delivered posthumously.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a non-observant Jew, attributing this to gender inequality in Jewish prayer ritual and relating it to her mother&#x27;s death. However, she said she might have felt differently if she were younger, and she was pleased that Reform and Conservative Judaism were becoming more egalitarian in this regard. In March 2015, Ginsburg and Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt released &quot;The Heroic and Visionary Women of Passover&quot;, an essay highlighting the roles of five key women in the saga. The text states, &quot;These women had a vision leading out of the darkness shrouding their world. They were women of action, prepared to defy authority to make their vision a reality bathed in the light of the day...&quot; In addition, she decorated her chambers with an artist&#x27;s rendering of the Hebrew phrase from Deuteronomy, &quot;Zedek, zedek, tirdof,&quot; (&quot;Justice, justice shall you pursue&quot;) as a reminder of her heritage and professional responsibility.

Ginsburg had a collection of lace jabots from around the world. She said in 2014 she had a particular jabot she wore when issuing her dissents (black with gold embroidery and faceted stones) as well as another she wore when issuing majority opinions (crocheted yellow and cream with crystals), which was a gift from her law clerks. Her favorite jabot (woven with white beads) was from Cape Town, South Africa.

===Health===
In 1999, Ginsburg was diagnosed with colon cancer, the first of her five bouts with cancer. She underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. During the process, she did not miss a day on the bench. Ginsburg was physically weakened by the cancer treatment, and she began working with a personal trainer. Bryant Johnson, a former Army reservist attached to the U.S. Army Special Forces, trained Ginsburg twice weekly in the justices-only gym at the Supreme Court. Ginsburg saw her physical fitness improve after her first bout with cancer; she was able to complete twenty push-ups in a session before her 80th birthday.

Nearly a decade after her first bout with cancer, Ginsburg again underwent surgery on February 5, 2009, this time for pancreatic cancer. She had a tumor that was discovered at an early stage. She was released from a New York City hospital on February 13, 2009, and returned to the bench when the Supreme Court went back into session on February 23, 2009. After experiencing discomfort while exercising in the Supreme Court gym in November 2014, she had a stent placed in her right coronary artery.

Ginsburg&#x27;s next hospitalization helped her detect another round of cancer. On November 8, 2018, Ginsburg fell in her office at the Supreme Court, fracturing three ribs, for which she was hospitalized. An outpouring of public support followed. Although the day after her fall, Ginsburg&#x27;s nephew revealed she had already returned to official judicial work after a day of observation, a CT scan of her ribs following her fall showed cancerous nodules in her lungs. On December 21, Ginsburg underwent a left-lung lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to remove the nodules. For the first time since joining the Court more than 25 years earlier, Ginsburg missed oral argument on January 7, 2019, while she recuperated. She returned to the Supreme Court on February 15, 2019, to participate in a private conference with other justices in her first appearance at the Court since her cancer surgery in December 2018.

Months later in August 2019, the Supreme Court announced that Ginsburg had recently completed three weeks of focused radiation treatment to ablate a tumor found in her pancreas over the summer. By January 2020, Ginsburg was cancer-free. By February 2020, the cancer had returned but this news was not released to the public. However, by May 2020, Ginsburg was once again receiving treatment for a recurrence of cancer. She reiterated her position that she &quot;would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam&quot;, adding that she remained fully able to do so.

==Death and succession==

Ginsburg died from complications of pancreatic cancer on September 18, 2020, at age 87. She died on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and according to Rabbi Richard Jacobs, &quot;One of the themes of Rosh Hashanah suggest that very righteous people would die at the very end of the year because they were needed until the very end&quot;. After the announcement of her death, thousands of people gathered in front of the Supreme Court building to lay flowers, light candles, and leave messages.

Five days after her death, the eight Supreme Court justices, Ginsburg&#x27;s children, and other family members held a private ceremony for Ginsburg in the Court&#x27;s great hall. Following the private ceremony, due to COVID-19 pandemic conditions prohibiting the usual lying in repose in the great hall, Ginsburg&#x27;s casket was moved outdoors to the Court&#x27;s west portico so the public could pay respects. Thousands of mourners lined up to walk past the casket over the course of two days. 

After the two days in repose at the Court, Ginsburg lay in state at the Capitol. She was the first woman and first Jew to lie in state therein. On September 29, Ginsburg was buried beside her husband in Arlington National Cemetery.

Ginsburg&#x27;s death opened a vacancy on the Supreme Court about six weeks before the 2020 presidential election, initiating controversies regarding the nomination and confirmation of her successor. Days before her death, Ginsburg dictated a statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera, as heard by Ginsburg&#x27;s doctor and others in the room at the time: &quot;My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.&quot; President Trump&#x27;s pick to replace her, Amy Coney Barrett, was confirmed by the Senate on October 27.

==Recognition==

In 2002, Ginsburg was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. Ginsburg was named one of 100 Most Powerful Women (2009), one of &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine&#x27;s Women of the Year 2012, and one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people (2015). She was awarded honorary degrees by Lund University (1969), American University Law School (1981), Vermont Law School (1984), Georgetown University (1985), DePaul University (1985), Brooklyn Law School (1987), Hebrew Union College (1988), Rutgers University (1990), Amherst College (1990), Lewis &amp; Clark College (1992), Columbia University (1994), Long Island University (1994), NYU (1994), Smith College (1994), The University of Illinois (1994), Brandeis University (1996), George Washington University (1997), Jewish Theological Seminary of America (1997), Wheaton College (Massachusetts) (1997), Northwestern University (1998), University of Michigan (2001), Brown University (2002), Yale University (2003), John Jay College of Criminal Justice (2004), Johns Hopkins University (2004), University of Pennsylvania (2007), Willamette University (2009), Princeton University (2010), Harvard University (2011), and the State University of New York (2019).

In 2009, Ginsburg received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Scribes—The American Society of Legal Writers.

In 2013, a painting featuring the four female justices to have served as justices on the Supreme Court (Ginsburg, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan) was unveiled at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

In 2018 Ginsburg was the inaugural recipient of the Genesis Lifetime Achievement Award.

Ginsburg was the recipient of the 2019 $1million Berggruen Prize for Philosophy and Culture, which is awarded annually by the US think tank the Berggruen Institute. This award recognizes &quot;thinkers whose ideas have profoundly shaped human self-understanding and advancement in a rapidly changing world&quot;, noting Ginsburg as &quot;a lifelong trailblazer for human rights and gender equality&quot;. Ginsburg donated the entirety of the prize money to charitable and non-profit organizations, including the Malala Fund, Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish-Arab Education in Israel, the American Bar Foundation, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the Washington Concert Opera. 

In 2019, the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles created &quot;Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg&quot;, a large-scale exhibition focusing on Ginsburg&#x27;s life and career.

In February 2020, she received the World Peace &amp; Liberty Award from the World Jurist Association and the World Law Foundation, their highest honor.

Ginsburg received numerous additional awards, including the LBJ Foundation&#x27;s Liberty &amp; Justice for All Award; a lifetime achievement award from Diane von Furstenberg&#x27;s foundation, and the 2020 Liberty Medal by the National Constitution Center, all in 2020 alone.

===Legacy===
In 2016, researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave a species of praying mantis the name &quot;Ilomantis ginsburgae&quot; after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the &quot;Ilomantis ginsburgae&quot; bears a resemblance to a jabot, which Ginsburg was known for wearing. Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect&#x27;s genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg&#x27;s fight for gender equality.

In 2019 the Dwight D. Opperman Foundation established the Ruth Bader Ginsburg Woman of Leadership Award in honour of Ginsburg, with her input into establishing the award criteria. Ginsburg presented the first award in February 2020 to arts patron and philanthropist Agnes Gund. After being presented to women in 2021–2023, the organization changed its award guidelines in 2024, with four of the five awards going to men, including Elon Musk and Rupert Murdoch. Ginsburg&#x27;s family distanced itself from the award and asked for her name to be removed from it. The awards were not given.

The Ruth Bader Ginsburg Medal, established by the World Jurist Association, was first presented in 2021. It aims to recognise prominent female jurists, and several awards are given each year.

The U.S. Navy announced on March 31, 2022, that it will name one of its &quot;John Lewis&quot;-class replenishment oilers the USNS &quot;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&quot;.

In August 2022, Ruth Bader Ginsburg Hall, a residence hall at Cornell University, opened its doors to the Class of 2026. 

An elementary school in Chicago was named to honor her in 2024.

In March 2023, a special memorial session of the Supreme Court honored Ginburg Also in 2023, Ginsburg was featured on a USPS Forever stamp. The stamp was designed by art director Ethel Kessler, using an oil painting by Michael J. Deas based on a photograph by Philip Bermingham.

==In popular culture==

Ginsburg has been referred to as a &quot;pop culture icon&quot; and also an &quot;American cultural icon&quot;. Ginsburg&#x27;s profile began to rise after O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s retirement in 2006 left Ginsburg as the only serving female justice. Her increasingly fiery dissents, particularly in &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot;, led to the creation of a sobriquet, &quot;the Notorious R.B.G.&quot; (a takeoff on the name of a rap star, the Notorious B.I.G.), which became an internet meme. The name beginning on Tumblr. The Tumblr blogger who coined the meme, law student Shana Knizhnik, teamed up with MSNBC reporter Irin Carmon to turn the contents of the blog into a book titled &quot;Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg&quot;. Published in October 2015, the book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. In 2016, the progressive magazine Current Affairs criticized Ginsburg&#x27;s status as an icon of progressivism, noting that her voting record was significantly more moderate than deceased justices Thurgood Marshall, William J. Brennan Jr., and William O. Douglas, and that she often sided with law enforcement in qualified immunity cases.

In 2015, Ginsburg and Scalia, known for their shared love of opera, were fictionalized in &quot;Scalia/Ginsburg&quot;, an opera by Derrick Wang broadcast on national radio on November 7, 2020. The opera was introduced before Ginsburg and Scalia at the Supreme Court in 2013, and Ginsburg attended the 2015 Castleton Festival world premiere as well as a revised version at the 2017 Glimmerglass Festival. Ginsburg, who with Scalia wrote forewords to Wang&#x27;s libretto, included excerpts from the opera as a chapter in her book &quot;My Own Words&quot;, quoted it in her official statement on Scalia&#x27;s death, and spoke about it frequently.

Additionally, Ginsburg&#x27;s pop culture appeal has inspired nail art, Halloween costumes, a bobblehead doll, tattoos, t-shirts, coffee mugs, and a children&#x27;s coloring book among other things. She appears in both a comic opera and a workout book. Musician Jonathan Mann also made a song using part of her &quot;Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.&quot; dissent. Ginsburg admitted to having a &quot;large supply&quot; of Notorious R.B.G. t-shirts, which she distributed as gifts.

Since 2015, Kate McKinnon has portrayed Ginsburg on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. McKinnon has repeatedly reprised the role, including during a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; sketch that aired from the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. The segments typically feature McKinnon (as Ginsburg) lobbing insults she calls &quot;Ginsburns&quot; and doing a celebratory dance. Filmmakers Betsy West and Julie Cohen created a documentary about Ginsburg, titled &quot;RBG&quot;, for CNN Films, which premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. In the film &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018), a photo of her is shown as Deadpool considers her for his X-Force, a team of superheroes. Another film, &quot;On the Basis of Sex&quot;, focusing on Ginsburg&#x27;s career struggles fighting for equal rights, was released later in 2018; its screenplay was named to the Black List of best unproduced screenplays of 2014. English actress Felicity Jones portrays Ginsburg in the film, with Armie Hammer as her husband Marty. Ginsburg herself has a cameo in the film. The seventh season of the sitcom &quot;New Girl&quot; features a three-year-old character named Ruth Bader Schmidt, named after Ginsburg. A Lego mini-figurine of Ginsburg is shown within a brief segment of &quot;The Lego Movie 2&quot;. Ginsburg gave her blessing for the cameo, as well as to have the mini-figurine produced as part of the Lego toy sets following the film&#x27;s release in February 2019. Also in 2019, Samuel Adams released a limited-edition beer called When There Are Nine, referring to Ginsburg&#x27;s well-known reply to the question about when there would be enough women on the Supreme Court.

In the sitcom &quot;The Good Place&quot;, the &quot;craziest secret celebrity hookup&quot; was Ginsburg and Canadian rapper Drake, whom protagonist Tahani reveals she set up as a &quot;perfect couple&quot;.

&quot;Sisters in Law&quot; (2015), a book by Linda Hirshman, follows the careers and judicial records of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor and Ginsburg.

In 2018, Ginsburg appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, which featured her following her regular workout routine accompanied by Stephen Colbert joking with her and attempting to perform the same routine. She also answered a few questions and weighed in on the famous internet question and ongoing debate &quot;Is a hot dog a sandwich?&quot; She ultimately ruled that, based on Colbert&#x27;s definition of a sandwich, a hot dog is a sandwich.

<text>The darters, anhingas, or snakebirds are mainly tropical waterbirds in the family Anhingidae, which contains a single genus, &quot;Anhinga&quot;. There are four living species, three of which are very common and widespread while the fourth is rarer and classified as near-threatened by the IUCN. The term &quot;snakebird&quot; is usually used without any additions to signify whichever of the completely allopatric species occurs in any one region. It refers to their long thin neck, which has a snake-like appearance when they swim with their bodies submerged, or when mated pairs twist it during their bonding displays. &quot;Darter&quot; is used with a geographical term when referring to particular species. It alludes to their manner of procuring food, as they impale fishes with their thin, pointed beak. The American darter (&quot;A. anhinga&quot;) is more commonly known as the anhinga. It is sometimes called &quot;water turkey&quot; in the southern United States; though the anhinga is quite unrelated to the wild turkey, they are both large, blackish birds with long tails that are sometimes hunted for food.

== Description ==
Anhingidae are large birds with sexually dimorphic plumage. They measure about in length, with a wingspan around , and weigh some . The males have black and dark-brown plumage, a short erectile crest on the nape and a larger bill than the female. The females have much paler plumage, especially on the neck and underparts, and are a bit larger overall. Both have grey stippling on long scapulars and upper wing coverts. The sharply pointed bill has serrated edges, a desmognathous palate and no external nostrils. The darters have completely webbed feet, and their legs are short and set far back on the body.

There is no eclipse plumage, but the bare parts vary in color around the year. During breeding, however, their small gular sac changes from pink or yellow to black, and the bare facial skin, otherwise yellow or yellow-green, turns turquoise. The iris changes in color between yellow, red or brown seasonally. The young hatch naked, but soon grow white or tan down.

Darter vocalizations include a clicking or rattling when flying or perching. In the nesting colonies, adults communicate with croaks, grunts or rattles. During breeding, adults sometimes give a &quot;caw&quot; or sighing or hissing calls. Nestlings communicate with squealing or squawking calls.

== Distribution and ecology ==
Darters are mostly tropical in distribution, ranging into subtropical and barely into warm temperate regions. They typically inhabit fresh water lakes, rivers, marshes, swamps, and are less often found along the seashore in brackish estuaries, bays, lagoons and mangrove. Most are sedentary and do not migrate; the populations in the coolest parts of the range may migrate however. Their preferred mode of flight is soaring and gliding; in flapping flight they are rather cumbersome. On dry land, darters walk with a high-stepped gait, wings often spread for balance, just like pelicans do. They tend to gather in flocks – sometimes up to about 100 birds – and frequently associate with storks, herons or ibises, but are highly territorial on the nest: despite being a colonial nester, breeding pairs – especially males – will stab at any other bird that ventures within reach of their long neck and bill. The Oriental darter (&quot;A. melanogaster sensu stricto&quot;) is a Near Threatened species. Habitat destruction along with other human interferences (such as egg collection and pesticide overuse) are the main reasons for declining darter populations.

=== Diet ===

Darters feed mainly on mid-sized fish; far more rarely, they eat other aquatic vertebrates and large invertebrates of comparable size. These birds are foot-propelled divers which quietly stalk and ambush their prey; then they use their sharply pointed bill to impale the food animal. They do not dive deep but make use of their low buoyancy made possible by wettable plumage, small air sacs and denser bones. On the underside of the cervical vertebrae 5–7 is a keel, which allows for muscles to attach to form a hinge-like mechanism that can project the neck, head and bill forward like a throwing spear. After they have stabbed the prey, they return to the surface where they toss their food into the air and catch it again, so that they can swallow it head-first. Like cormorants, they have a vestigial preen gland and their plumage gets wet during diving. To dry their feathers after diving, darters move to a safe location and spread their wings. Darters go through a synchronous moult of all their primaries and secondaries making them temporarily flightless, although it is possible that some individuals go through incomplete moults.

=== Predation ===
Predators of darters are mainly large carnivorous birds, including passerines like the Australian raven (&quot;Corvus coronoides&quot;) and house crow (&quot;Corvus splendens&quot;), and birds of prey such as marsh harriers (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot; complex) or Pallas&#x27;s fish eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucoryphus&quot;). Predation by &quot;Crocodylus&quot; crocodiles has also been noted. But many would-be predators know better than to try to catch a darter. The long neck and pointed bill in combination with the &quot;darting&quot; mechanism make the birds dangerous even to larger carnivorous mammals, and they will actually move toward an intruder to attack rather than defending passively or fleeing.

=== Breeding ===
They usually breed in colonies, occasionally mixed with cormorants or herons. The darters pair bond monogamously at least for a breeding season. There are many different types of displays used for mating. Males display to attract females by raising (but not stretching) their wings to wave them in an alternating fashion, bowing and snapping the bill, or giving twigs to potential mates. To strengthen the pair bond, partners rub their bills or wave, point upwards or bow their necks in unison. When one partner comes to relieve the other at the nest, males and females use the same display the male employs during courtship; during changeovers, the birds may also &quot;yawn&quot; at each other.
Breeding is seasonal (peaking in March/April) at the northern end of their range; elsewhere they can be found breeding all year round. The nests are made of twigs and lined with leaves; they are built in trees or reeds, usually near water. Typically, the male gathers nesting material and brings it to the female, which does most of the actual construction work. Nest construction takes only a few days (about three at most), and the pairs copulate at the nest site. The clutch size is two to six eggs (usually about four) which have a pale green color. The eggs are laid within 24–48 hours and incubated for 25 to 30 days, starting after the first has been laid; they hatch asynchronously. To provide warmth to the eggs, the parents will cover them with their large webbed feet, because like their relatives they lack a brood patch. The last young to hatch will usually starve in years with little food available. Bi-parental care is given and the young are considered altricial. They are fed by regurgitation of partly digested food when young, switching to entire food items as they grow older. After fledging, the young are fed for about two more weeks while they learn to hunt for themselves.

These birds reach sexual maturity by about two years, and generally live to around nine years. The maximum possible lifespan of darters seems to be about sixteen years.

Darter eggs are edible and considered delicious by some; they are locally collected by humans as food. The adults are also eaten occasionally, as they are rather meaty birds (comparable to a domestic duck); like other fish-eating birds such as cormorants or seaducks they do not taste particularly good though. Darter eggs and nestlings are also collected in a few places to raise the young. Sometimes this is done for food, but some nomads in Assam and Bengal train tame darters to be employed as in cormorant fishing. With an increasing number of nomads settling down in recent decades, this cultural heritage is in danger of being lost. On the other hand, as evidenced by the etymology of &quot;anhinga&quot; detailed below, the Tupi seem to have considered the anhinga a kind of bird of ill omen.

== Systematics and evolution ==

The genus &quot;Anhinga&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760, with the anhinga or American darter (&quot;Anhinga anhinga&quot;) as the type species. &quot;Anhinga&quot; is derived from the Tupi &quot;ajíŋa&quot; (also transcribed &quot;áyinga&quot; or &quot;ayingá&quot;), which in local mythology refers to a malevolent demonic forest spirit; it is often translated as &quot;devil bird&quot;. The name changed to &quot;anhingá&quot; or &quot;anhangá&quot; as it was transferred to the Tupi–Portuguese Língua Geral. However, in its first documented use as an English term in 1818, it referred to an Old World darter. Ever since, it has also been used for the modern genus &quot;Anhinga&quot; as a whole.

This family is very closely related to the other families in the suborder Sulae, i.e. the Phalacrocoracidae (cormorants and shags) and the Sulidae (gannets and boobies). Cormorants and darters are extremely similar as regards their body and leg skeletons and may be sister taxa. In fact, several darter fossils were initially believed to be cormorants or shags (see below). Some earlier authors included the darters in the Phalacrocoracidae as subfamily Anhingina, but this is nowadays generally considered overlumping. However, as this agrees quite well with the fossil evidence, some unite the Anhingidae and Phalacrocoracidae in a superfamily Phalacrocoracoidea.

The Sulae are also united by their characteristic display behavior, which agrees with the phylogeny as laid out by anatomical and DNA sequence data. While the darters&#x27; lack of many display behaviors is shared with gannets (and that of a few with cormorants), these are all symplesiomorphies that are absent in frigatebirds, tropicbirds and pelicans also. Like cormorants but unlike other birds, darters use their hyoid bone to stretch the gular sac in display. Whether the pointing display of mates is another synapomorphy of darters and cormorants that was dropped again in some of the latter, or whether it evolved independently in darters and those cormorants that do it, is not clear. The male raised-wing display seems to be a synapomorphy of the Sulae; like almost all cormorants and shags but unlike almost all gannets and boobies, darters keep their wrists bent as they lift the wings in display, but their alternating wing-waving, which they also show before take-off, is unique. That they often balance with their outstretched wings during walking is probably an autapomorphy of darters, necessitated by their being plumper than the other Sulae.

The Sulae were traditionally included in the Pelecaniformes, then a paraphyletic group of &quot;higher waterbirds&quot;. The supposed traits uniting them, like all-webbed toes and a bare gular sac, are now known to be convergent, and pelicans are apparently closer relatives of storks than of the Sulae. Hence, the Sulae and the frigatebirds – and some prehistoric relatives – are increasingly separated as the Suliformes, which is sometimes dubbed &quot;Phalacrocoraciformes&quot;.

=== Living species ===
There are four living species of darters recognized, all in the genus &quot;Anhinga&quot;, although the Old World ones were often lumped together as subspecies of &quot;A. melanogaster&quot;. They may form a superspecies with regard to the more distinct anhinga:





Extinct &quot;darters&quot; from Mauritius and Australia known only from bones were described as &quot;Anhinga nana&quot; (&quot;Mauritian darter&quot;) and &quot;Anhinga parva&quot;. But these are actually misidentified bones of the long-tailed cormorant (&quot;Microcarbo/Phalacrocorax africanus&quot;) and the little pied cormorant (&quot;M./P. melanoleucos&quot;), respectively. In the former case, however, the remains are larger than those of the geographically closest extant population of long-tailed cormorants on Madagascar: they thus might belong to an extinct subspecies (Mauritian cormorant), which would have to be called &quot;Microcarbo africanus nanus&quot; (or &quot;Phalacrocorax a. nanus&quot;) – quite ironically, as the Latin term &quot;nanus&quot; means dwarf. The Late Pleistocene &quot;Anhinga laticeps&quot; is not specifically distinct from the Australasian darter; it might have been a large paleosubspecies of the last ice age.

=== Fossil record ===
The fossil record of the Anhingidae is rather dense, but very apomorphic already and appears to be lacking its base. The other families placed in the Phalacrocoraciformes sequentially appear throughout the Eocene, the most distinct – frigatebirds – being known since almost 50 Ma (million years ago) and probably of Paleocene origin. With fossil gannets being known since the mid-Eocene (c. 40 Ma) and fossil cormorants appearing soon thereafter, the origin of the darters as a distinct lineage was presumably around 50–40 Ma, maybe a bit earlier.

Fossil Anhingidae are known since the Early Miocene; a number of prehistoric darters similar to those still alive have been described, as well as some more distinct genera now extinct. The diversity was highest in South America, and thus it is likely that the family originated there. Some of the genera which ultimately became extinct were very large, and a tendency to become flightless has been noted in prehistoric darters. Their distinctness has been doubted, but this was due to the supposed &quot;&quot;Anhinga&quot; fraileyi&quot; being rather similar to &quot;Macranhinga&quot;, rather than due to them resembling the living species:
* &quot;Meganhinga&quot; (Early Miocene of Chile)
* &quot;Paranavis&quot; (Middle/Late Miocene of Paraná, Argentina) – a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;
* &quot;Macranhinga&quot; (Middle/Late Miocene – Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of SC South America) – may include &quot;&quot;Anhinga&quot; fraileyi&quot;
* &quot;Giganhinga&quot; (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene of Uruguay)

;&quot;Anhinga&quot;
Prehistoric members of &quot;Anhinga&quot; were presumably distributed in similar climates as today, ranging into Europe in the hotter and wetter Miocene. With their considerable stamina and continent-wide distribution abilities (as evidenced by the anhinga and the Old World superspecies), the smaller lineage has survived for over 20 Ma. As evidenced by the fossil species&#x27; biogeography centered around the equator, with the younger species ranging eastwards out of the Americas, the Hadley cell seems to have been the main driver of the genus&#x27; success and survival:
* &quot;Anhinga walterbolesi&quot; (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene of central Australia
* &quot;Anhinga subvolans&quot; (Early Miocene of Thomas Farm, US) – formerly in &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;
* &quot;Anhinga&quot; cf. &quot;grandis&quot; (Middle Miocene of Colombia –? Late Pliocene of SC South America)
* &quot;Anhinga&quot; sp. (Sajóvölgyi Middle Miocene of Mátraszõlõs, Hungary) – &quot;A. pannonica&quot;?
* &quot;&quot;Anhinga&quot; fraileyi&quot; (Late Miocene –? Early Pliocene of SC South America) – may belong in &quot;Macranhinga&quot;
* &quot;Anhinga pannonica&quot; (Late Miocene of C Europe ?and Tunisia, East Africa, Pakistan and Thailand –? Sahabi Early Pliocene of Libya)
* &quot;Anhinga minuta&quot; (Solimões Late Miocene/Early Pliocene of SC South America)
* &quot;Anhinga grandis&quot; (Late Miocene –? Late Pliocene of US)
* &quot;Anhinga malagurala&quot; (Allingham Early Pliocene of Charters Towers, Australia)
* &quot;Anhinga&quot; sp. (Early Pliocene of Bone Valley, US) – &quot;A. beckeri&quot;?
* &quot;Anhinga hadarensis&quot; (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene of E Africa)
* &quot;Anhinga beckeri&quot; (Early – Late Pleistocene of SE US)

&quot;Protoplotus&quot;, a small Paleogene phalacrocoraciform from Sumatra, was in old times considered a primitive darter. However, it is also placed in its own family (Protoplotidae) and might be a basal member of the Sulae and/or close to the common ancestor of cormorants and darters.

<text>An airbase (stylised air base in American English), sometimes referred to as a military airbase, military airfield, military airport, air station, naval air station, air force station, or air force base, is an aerodrome or airport used as a military base by a military force for the operation of military aircraft.

==Airbase facilities==
An airbase typically has some facilities similar to a civilian airport; for example, air traffic control and firefighting. Some military aerodromes have passenger facilities; for example, RAF Brize Norton in England has a terminal used by passengers for the Royal Air Force&#x27;s passenger transport flights. A number of military airbases may also have a civil enclave for commercial passenger flights, e.g. Beijing Nanyuan Airport (China), Chandigarh Airport (India), Ibaraki Airport (Japan), Burlington International Airport (USA),
Sheikh Ul-Alam International Airport Srinagar (India), Taipei Songshan Airport (Taiwan), Eindhoven airport (The Netherlands). Likewise, the opposite also occurs; large civilian airports may contain a smaller military airbase within their environs, such as Royal Brunei Air Force Base, Rimba (located within Brunei International Airport).

Some airbases have dispersed aircraft parking, revetments, hardened aircraft shelters, or even underground hangars, to protect aircraft from enemy attack. Combat aircraft require secure protected storage of aircraft ordnance and munitions. Other facilities may also include technical buildings for servicing and support of survival equipment (including flying helmets and personal liquid oxygen), flight simulator for synthetic training, servicing facilities for all aircraft systems (airframes, propulsion, avionics, weapons systems) and associated ground support systems (including mechanical transport). All military airbases will have buildings for military administration (station headquarters, squadron briefing and operations), and larger bases will also include medical and dental facilities for military personnel (and sometimes their dependents), along with dining (mess, informally known as the &#x27;cook house&#x27;), accommodation (single living accommodation for junior ranks, Sergeants&#x27; and Officers&#x27; Mess for senior non-commissioned officers and commissioned officers), recreational facilities (club house for socialising), shopping facilities (NAAFI shops, base exchange, commissary), and sports facilities (gymnasium, swimming pool, sports pitches). An airbase may be defended by anti-aircraft weapons and force protection troops.
==Dispersal airbase==
A dispersal (or dispersed) airbase is an airfield that is used for the purpose of dispersing air units in the event of conflict, so to minimise the vulnerability of aircraft and its supporting units whilst on the ground. Dispersal airbases are not necessarily ordinarily operational in peace time, and may only be activated when needed. Airfields used as dispersal bases can either be auxiliary military airfields, civilian airports, or highway strips. Examples of uses of dispersal bases are the Swedish Bas 60 and Bas 90 systems, the British V-Bomber dispersal bases, and NATO&#x27;s Dispersed Operating Bases in France.
==Road airbase==

Road airbases are highways constructed to double as auxiliary airbases in the event of war. Countries known to utilise this strategy are India, Sweden, Finland, Germany (formerly), Singapore, Switzerland, South Korea, Turkey, Poland, Pakistan, and the Czech Republic. In the case of Finnish road airbases, the space needed for landing aircraft is reduced by means of an arrestor wire, similar to that used on some aircraft carriers (Finnish Air Force uses F/A-18s, which were originally designed to land on aircraft carriers).

==Aircraft carrier==

An aircraft carrier is a type of naval ship which serves as a seaborne airbase, the development of which has greatly enhanced the capabilities of modern air forces and naval aviation. In many countries, they are now a key part of the military, allowing for their military aircraft to be staged much nearer the area of conflict. Aircraft carriers were vital to the United States during World War II, Korea and the Vietnam War, and to the United Kingdom in the 1982 Falklands War. They retain modern roles as well as &quot;several acres of sovereign territory a nation can move about at will&quot;, which allows greater flexibility in diplomacy as well as military affairs. Aircraft carriers may also used in disaster relief.

<text>Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted by the thermal motion of particles in matter. All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation. The emission of energy arises from a combination of electronic, molecular, and lattice oscillations in a material. Kinetic energy is converted to electromagnetism due to charge-acceleration or dipole oscillation. At room temperature, most of the emission is in the infrared (IR) spectrum, though above around 525 °C (977 °F) enough of it becomes visible for the matter to visibly glow. This visible glow is called incandescence. Thermal radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer, along with conduction and convection.

The primary method by which the Sun transfers heat to the Earth is thermal radiation. This energy is partially absorbed and scattered in the atmosphere, the latter process being the reason why the sky is visibly blue. Much of the Sun&#x27;s radiation transmits through the atmosphere to the surface where it is either absorbed or reflected.

Thermal radiation can be used to detect objects or phenomena normally invisible to the human eye. Thermographic cameras create an image by sensing infrared radiation. These images can represent the temperature gradient of a scene and are commonly used to locate objects at a higher temperature than their surroundings. In a dark environment where visible light is at low levels, infrared images can be used to locate animals or people due to their body temperature. Cosmic microwave background radiation is another example of thermal radiation.

Blackbody radiation is a concept used to analyze thermal radiation in idealized systems. This model applies if a radiating object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium. Planck&#x27;s law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation, and relates the radiative heat flux from a body to its temperature. Wien&#x27;s displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation, and the Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the radiant intensity. Where blackbody radiation is not an accurate approximation, emission and absorption can be modeled using quantum electrodynamics (QED).

==Overview==
Thermal radiation is the emission of electromagnetic waves from all matter that has a temperature greater than absolute zero. Thermal radiation reflects the conversion of thermal energy into electromagnetic energy. Thermal energy is the kinetic energy of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. It is present in all matter of nonzero temperature. These atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles, i.e., protons and electrons. The kinetic interactions among matter particles result in charge acceleration and dipole oscillation. This results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of photons, radiating energy away from the body. Electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, will propagate indefinitely in vacuum.

The characteristics of thermal radiation depend on various properties of the surface from which it is emanating, including its temperature and its spectral emissivity, as expressed by Kirchhoff&#x27;s law. The radiation is not monochromatic, i.e., it does not consist of only a single frequency, but comprises a continuous spectrum of photon energies, its characteristic spectrum. If the radiating body and its surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium and the surface has perfect absorptivity at all wavelengths, it is characterized as a black body. A black body is also a perfect emitter. The radiation of such perfect emitters is called black-body radiation. The ratio of any body&#x27;s emission relative to that of a black body is the body&#x27;s emissivity, so a black body has an emissivity of one.

Absorptivity, reflectivity, and emissivity of all bodies are dependent on the wavelength of the radiation. Due to reciprocity, absorptivity and emissivity for any particular wavelength are equal at equilibrium – a good absorber is necessarily a good emitter, and a poor absorber is a poor emitter. The temperature determines the wavelength distribution of the electromagnetic radiation.

The distribution of power that a black body emits with varying frequency is described by Planck&#x27;s law. At any given temperature, there is a frequency &quot;f&quot;max at which the power emitted is a maximum. Wien&#x27;s displacement law, and the fact that the frequency is inversely proportional to the wavelength, indicates that the peak frequency &quot;f&quot;max is proportional to the absolute temperature &quot;T&quot; of the black body. The photosphere of the sun, at a temperature of approximately 6000 K, emits radiation principally in the (human-)visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is partly transparent to visible light, and the light reaching the surface is absorbed or reflected. Earth&#x27;s surface emits the absorbed radiation, approximating the behavior of a black body at 300 K with spectral peak at &quot;f&quot;max. At these lower frequencies, the atmosphere is largely opaque and radiation from Earth&#x27;s surface is absorbed or scattered by the atmosphere. Though about 10% of this radiation escapes into space, most is absorbed and then re-emitted by atmospheric gases. It is this spectral selectivity of the atmosphere that is responsible for the planetary greenhouse effect, contributing to global warming and climate change in general (but also critically contributing to climate stability when the composition and properties of the atmosphere are not changing).

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===
Burning glasses are known to date back to about 700 BC. One of the first accurate mentions of burning glasses appears in Aristophanes&#x27;s comedy, &quot;The Clouds&quot;, written in 423 BC. According to the Archimedes&#x27; heat ray anecdote, Archimedes is purported to have developed mirrors to concentrate heat rays in order to burn attacking Roman ships during the Siege of Syracuse (c. 213–212 BC), but no sources from the time have been confirmed. &quot;Catoptrics&quot; is a book attributed to Euclid on how to focus light in order to produce heat, but the book might have been written in 300 AD.

=== Renaissance ===
During the Renaissance, Santorio Santorio came up with one of the earliest thermoscopes. In 1612 he published his results on the heating effects from the Sun, and his attempts to measure heat from the Moon.

Earlier, in 1589, Giambattista della Porta reported on the heat felt on his face, emitted by a remote candle and facilitated by a concave metallic mirror. He also reported the cooling felt from a solid ice block. Della Porta&#x27;s experiment would be replicated many times with increasing accuracy. It was replicated by astronomers Giovanni Antonio Magini and Christopher Heydon in 1603, and supplied instructions for Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor who performed it in 1611. In 1660, della Porta&#x27;s experiment was updated by the Accademia del Cimento using a thermometer invented by Ferdinand II, Grand Duke of Tuscany.

=== Enlightenment ===
In 1761, Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter describing his experiments on the relationship between color and heat absorption. He found that darker color clothes got hotter when exposed to sunlight than lighter color clothes. One experiment he performed consisted of placing square pieces of cloth of various colors out in the snow on a sunny day. He waited some time and then measured that the black pieces sank furthest into the snow of all the colors, indicating that they got the hottest and melted the most snow.

=== Caloric theory ===

Antoine Lavoisier considered that radiation of heat was concerned with the condition of the surface of a physical body rather than the material of which it was composed. Lavoisier described a poor radiator to be a substance with a polished or smooth surface as it possessed its molecules lying in a plane closely bound together thus creating a surface layer of caloric fluid which insulated the release of the rest within. He described a good radiator to be a substance with a rough surface as only a small proportion of molecules held caloric in within a given plane, allowing for greater escape from within. Count Rumford would later cite this explanation of caloric movement as insufficient to explain the radiation of cold, which became a point of contention for the theory as a whole.

In his first memoir, Augustin-Jean Fresnel responded to a view he extracted from a French translation of Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot;. He says that Newton imagined particles of light traversing space uninhibited by the caloric medium filling it, and refutes this view (never actually held by Newton) by saying that a body under illumination would increase indefinitely in heat.

In Marc-Auguste Pictet&#x27;s famous experiment of 1790, it was reported that a thermometer detected a lower temperature when a set of mirrors were used to focus &quot;frigorific rays&quot; from a cold object.

In 1791, Pierre Prevost a colleague of Pictet, introduced the concept of radiative equilibrium, wherein all objects both radiate and absorb heat. When an object is cooler than its surroundings, it absorbs more heat than it emits, causing its temperature to increase until it reaches equilibrium. Even at equilibrium, it continues to radiate heat, balancing absorption and emission.

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to astronomer William Herschel. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the calorific rays, beyond the red part of the spectrum, by an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer in that region.

=== Electromagnetic theory ===
At the end of the 19th century it was shown that the transmission of light or of radiant heat was allowed by the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Television and radio broadcasting waves are types of electromagnetic waves with specific wavelengths. All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed; therefore, shorter wavelengths are associated with high frequencies. All bodies generate and receive electromagnetic waves at the expense of heat exchange.

In 1860, Gustav Kirchhoff published a mathematical description of thermal equilibrium (i.e. Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation). By 1884 the emissive power of a perfect blackbody was inferred by Josef Stefan using John Tyndall&#x27;s experimental measurements, and derived by Ludwig Boltzmann from fundamental statistical principles. This relation is known as Stefan–Boltzmann law.

=== Quantum theory ===
The microscopic theory of radiation is best known as the quantum theory and was first offered by Max Planck in 1900. According to this theory, energy emitted by a radiator is not continuous but is in the form of quanta. Planck noted that energy was emitted in quantas of frequency of vibration similarly to the wave theory. The energy &quot;E&quot; of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum is found by the expression &quot;E&quot; = &quot;hf&quot;, where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant and &quot;f&quot; is its frequency.

Bodies at higher temperatures emit radiation at higher frequencies with an increasing energy per quantum. While the propagation of electromagnetic waves of all wavelengths is often referred as &quot;radiation&quot;, thermal radiation is often constrained to the visible and infrared regions. For engineering purposes, it may be stated that thermal radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation which varies on the nature of a surface and its temperature.

Radiation waves may travel in unusual patterns compared to conduction heat flow. Radiation allows waves to travel from a heated body through a cold non-absorbing or partially absorbing medium and reach a warmer body again. An example is the case of the radiation waves that travel from the Sun to the Earth.

==Characteristics==

=== Frequency ===
Thermal radiation emitted by a body at any temperature consists of a wide range of frequencies. The frequency distribution is given by Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation for an idealized emitter as shown in the diagram at top.

The dominant frequency (or color) range of the emitted radiation shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature of the emitter increases. For example, a &quot;red hot&quot; object radiates mainly in the long wavelengths (red and orange) of the visible band. If it is heated further, it also begins to emit discernible amounts of green and blue light, and the spread of frequencies in the entire visible range cause it to appear white to the human eye; it is &quot;white hot&quot;. Even at a white-hot temperature of 2000 K, 99% of the energy of the radiation is still in the infrared. This is determined by Wien&#x27;s displacement law. In the diagram the peak value for each curve moves to the left as the temperature increases.

=== Relationship to temperature ===
The total radiation intensity of a black body rises as the fourth power of the absolute temperature, as expressed by the Stefan–Boltzmann law. A kitchen oven, at a temperature about double room temperature on the absolute temperature scale (600 K vs. 300 K) radiates 16 times as much power per unit area. An object at the temperature of the filament in an incandescent light bulb—roughly 3000 K, or 10 times room temperature—radiates 10,000 times as much energy per unit area.

As for photon statistics, thermal light obeys Super-Poissonian statistics.

=== Appearance ===
When the temperature of a body is high enough, its thermal radiation spectrum becomes strong enough in the visible range to visibly glow. The visible component of thermal radiation is sometimes called &quot;incandescence&quot;,
though this term can also refer to thermal radiation in general. The term derive from the Latin verb , &#x27;to glow white&#x27;.

In practice, virtually all solid or liquid substances start to glow around , with a mildly dull red color, whether or not a chemical reaction takes place that produces light as a result of an exothermic process. This limit is called the Draper point. The incandescence does not vanish below that temperature, but it is too weak in the visible spectrum to be perceptible.

=== Reciprocity ===
The rate of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body at a given frequency is proportional to the rate that the body absorbs radiation at that frequency, a property known as reciprocity. Thus, a surface that absorbs more red light thermally radiates more red light. This principle applies to all properties of the wave, including wavelength (color), direction, polarization, and even coherence. It is therefore possible to have thermal radiation which is polarized, coherent, and directional; though polarized and coherent sources are fairly rare in nature.

==Fundamental principles==
Thermal radiation is one of the three principal mechanisms of heat transfer. It entails the emission of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation due to an object&#x27;s temperature. Other mechanisms are convection and conduction.

=== Electromagnetic waves ===

Thermal radiation is characteristically different from conduction and convection in that it does not require a medium and, in fact it reaches maximum efficiency in a vacuum. Thermal radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation which is often modeled by the propagation of waves. These waves have the standard wave properties of frequency, formula_1 and wavelength, formula_2 which are related by the equationformula_3where formula_4 is the speed of light in the medium.

=== Irradiation ===

&quot;Thermal irradiation&quot; is the rate at which radiation is incident upon a surface per unit area. It is measured in watts per square meter. Irradiation can either be &quot;reflected&quot;, &quot;absorbed&quot;, or &quot;transmitted&quot;. The components of irradiation can then be characterized by the equation

:formula_5

where, formula_6 represents the absorptivity, formula_7 reflectivity and formula_8 transmissivity. These components are a function of the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave as well as the material properties of the medium.

==== Absorptivity and emissivity ====
The spectral absorption is equal to the emissivity formula_9; this relation is known as Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation. An object is called a black body if this holds for all frequencies, and the following formula applies:
:formula_10
If objects appear white (reflective in the visual spectrum), they are not necessarily equally reflective (and thus non-emissive) in the thermal infrared – see the diagram at the left. Most household radiators are painted white, which is sensible given that they are not hot enough to radiate any significant amount of heat, and are not designed as thermal radiators at all – instead, they are actually convectors, and painting them matt black would make little difference to their efficacy. Acrylic and urethane based white paints have 93% blackbody radiation efficiency at room temperature (meaning the term &quot;black body&quot; does not always correspond to the visually perceived color of an object). These materials that do not follow the &quot;black color = high emissivity/absorptivity&quot; caveat will most likely have functional spectral emissivity/absorptivity dependence.

Only truly &quot;gray&quot; systems (relative equivalent emissivity/absorptivity and no directional transmissivity dependence in &quot;all&quot; control volume bodies considered) can achieve reasonable steady-state heat flux estimates through the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Encountering this &quot;ideally calculable&quot; situation is almost impossible (although common engineering procedures surrender the dependency of these unknown variables and &quot;assume&quot; this to be the case). Optimistically, these &quot;gray&quot; approximations will get close to real solutions, as most divergence from Stefan-Boltzmann solutions is very small (especially in most standard temperature and pressure lab controlled environments).

==== Reflectivity ====
Reflectivity deviates from the other properties in that it is bidirectional in nature. In other words, this property depends on the direction of the incident of radiation as well as the direction of the reflection. Therefore, the reflected rays of a radiation spectrum incident on a real surface in a specified direction forms an irregular shape that is not easily predictable. In practice, surfaces are often assumed to reflect either in a perfectly specular or a diffuse manner. In a specular reflection, the angles of reflection and incidence are equal. In diffuse reflection, radiation is reflected equally in all directions. Reflection from smooth and polished surfaces can be assumed to be specular reflection, whereas reflection from rough surfaces approximates diffuse reflection. In radiation analysis a surface is defined as smooth if the height of the surface roughness is much smaller relative to the wavelength of the incident radiation.

==== Transmissivity ====
A medium that experiences no transmission (formula_11) is &quot;opaque,&quot; in which case absorptivity and reflectivity sum to unity:formula_12

=== Radiation intensity ===

Radiation emitted from a surface can propagate in any direction from the surface. Irradiation can also be incident upon a surface from any direction. The amount of irradiation on a surface is therefore dependent on the relative orientation of both the emitter and the receiver. The parameter &quot;radiation intensity,&quot; formula_13 is used to quantify how much radiation makes it from one surface to another.

Radiation intensity is often modeled using a spherical coordinate system.

==== Emissive power ====

&quot;Emissive power&quot; is the rate at which radiation is emitted per unit area. It is a measure of heat flux. The total emissive power from a surface is denoted as formula_14 and can be determined by,formula_15where formula_16 is in units of steradians and formula_13 is the total intensity.

The total emissive power can also be found by integrating the &quot;spectral emissive power&quot; over all possible wavelengths. This is calculated as,formula_18where formula_2 represents wavelength.

The spectral emissive power can also be determined from the spectral intensity, formula_20as follows,

formula_21where both spectral emissive power and emissive intensity are functions of wavelength.

=== Blackbody radiation ===

A &quot;black body&quot; is a body which has the property of allowing all incident rays to enter without surface reflection and not allowing them to leave again.

Blackbodies are idealized surfaces that act as the perfect absorber and emitter. They serve as the standard against which real surfaces are compared when characterizing thermal radiation. A blackbody is defined by three characteristics:

# &quot;A blackbody absorbs all incident radiation, regardless of wavelength and direction.&quot;
# &quot;No surface can emit more energy than a blackbody for a given temperature and wavelength.&quot;
# &quot;A blackbody is a diffuse emitter.&quot;

==== The Planck distribution ====

The spectral intensity of a blackbody, formula_22 was first determined by Max Planck. It is given by Planck&#x27;s law per unit wavelength as:formula_23This formula mathematically follows from calculation of spectral distribution of energy in quantized electromagnetic field which is in complete thermal equilibrium with the radiating object. Planck&#x27;s law shows that radiative energy increases with temperature, and explains why the peak of an emission spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures. It can also be found that energy emitted at shorter wavelengths increases more rapidly with temperature relative to longer wavelengths. 

The equation is derived as an infinite sum over all possible frequencies in a semi-sphere region. The energy, formula_24, of each photon is multiplied by the number of states available at that frequency, and the probability that each of those states will be occupied.

==== Stefan-Boltzmann law ====
The Planck distribution can be used to find the spectral emissive power of a blackbody, formula_25 as follows,

formula_26

The total emissive power of a blackbody is then calculated as,formula_27The solution of the above integral yields a remarkably elegant equation for the total emissive power of a blackbody, the &quot;Stefan-Boltzmann law&quot;, which is given as,formula_28where formula_29 is the &quot;Steffan-Boltzmann constant&quot;.

==== Wien&#x27;s displacement law ====

The wavelength formula_30 for which the emission intensity is highest is given by Wien&#x27;s displacement law as:

:formula_31

==== Constants ====
Definitions of constants used in the above equations:
==== Variables ====
Definitions of variables, with example values:
=== Emission from non-black surfaces ===
For surfaces which are not black bodies, one has to consider the (generally frequency dependent) emissivity factor formula_32. This factor has to be multiplied with the radiation spectrum formula before integration. If it is taken as a constant, the resulting formula for the power output can be written in a way that contains formula_9 as a factor:
:formula_34

This type of theoretical model, with frequency-independent emissivity lower than that of a perfect black body, is often known as a &quot;grey body&quot;. For frequency-dependent emissivity, the solution for the integrated power depends on the functional form of the dependence, though in general there is no simple expression for it. Practically speaking, if the emissivity of the body is roughly constant around the peak emission wavelength, the gray body model tends to work fairly well since the weight of the curve around the peak emission tends to dominate the integral.

==Heat transfer between surfaces==
Calculation of radiative heat transfer between groups of objects, including a &#x27;cavity&#x27; or &#x27;surroundings&#x27; requires solution of a set of simultaneous equations using the radiosity method. In these calculations, the geometrical configuration of the problem is distilled to a set of numbers called view factors, which give the proportion of radiation leaving any given surface that hits another specific surface. These calculations are important in the fields of solar thermal energy, boiler and furnace design and raytraced computer graphics.

The &quot;net&quot; radiative heat transfer from one surface to another is the radiation leaving the first surface for the other minus that arriving from the second surface. + \frac{1 - \epsilon_2}{A_2\epsilon_2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where formula_35 and formula_36 are the emissivities of the surfaces.

Formulas for radiative heat transfer can be derived for more particular or more elaborate physical arrangements, such as between parallel plates, concentric spheres and the internal surfaces of a cylinder.

== Applications ==
Thermal radiation is an important factor of many engineering applications, especially for those dealing with high temperatures.

=== Solar energy ===
Sunlight is the incandescence of the &quot;white hot&quot; surface of the Sun. Electromagnetic radiation from the sun has a peak wavelength of about 550 nm, and can be harvested to generate heat or electricity.

Thermal radiation can be concentrated on a tiny spot via reflecting mirrors, which concentrating solar power takes advantage of. Instead of mirrors, Fresnel lenses can also be used to concentrate radiant energy. Either method can be used to quickly vaporize water into steam using sunlight. For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the PS10 Solar Power Plant, and during the day it can heat water to .

A selective surface can be used when energy is being extracted from the sun. Selective surfaces are surfaces tuned to maximize the amount of energy they absorb from the sun&#x27;s radiation while minimizing the amount of energy they lose to their own thermal radiation. Selective surfaces can also be used on solar collectors.

=== Incandescent light bulbs ===
The incandescent light bulb creates light by heating a filament to a temperature at which it emits significant visible thermal radiation. For a tungsten filament at a typical temperature of 3000 K, only a small fraction of the emitted radiation is visible, and the majority is infrared light. This infrared light does not help a person see, but still transfers heat to the environment, making incandescent lights relatively inefficient as a light source.
If the filament could be made hotter, efficiency would increase; however, there are currently no materials able to withstand such temperatures which would be appropriate for use in lamps.

More efficient light sources, such as fluorescent lamps and LEDs, do not function by incandescence.

=== Thermal comfort ===

Thermal radiation plays a crucial role in human comfort, influencing perceived temperature sensation. Various technologies have been developed to enhance thermal comfort, including personal heating and cooling devices.

The mean radiant temperature is a metric used to quantify the exchange of radiant heat between a human and their surrounding environment.

==== Personal heating ====
Radiant personal heaters are devices that convert energy into infrared radiation that are designed to increase a user&#x27;s perceived temperature. They typically are either gas-powered or electric. In domestic and commercial applications, gas-powered radiant heaters can produce a higher heat flux than electric heaters which are limited by the amount of current that can be drawn through a circuit breaker.

==== Personal cooling ====
Personalized cooling technology is an example of an application where optical spectral selectivity can be beneficial. Conventional personal cooling is typically achieved through heat conduction and convection. However, the human body is a very efficient emitter of infrared radiation, which provides an additional cooling mechanism. Most conventional fabrics are opaque to infrared radiation and block thermal emission from the body to the environment. Fabrics for personalized cooling applications have been proposed that enable infrared transmission to directly pass through clothing, while being opaque at visible wavelengths, allowing the wearer to remain cooler.

=== Windows ===
Low-emissivity windows in houses are a more complicated technology, since they must have low emissivity at thermal wavelengths while remaining transparent to visible light. To reduce the heat transfer from a surface, such as a glass window, a clear reflective film with a low emissivity coating can be placed on the interior of the surface. &quot;Low-emittance (low-E) coatings are microscopically thin, virtually invisible, metal or metallic oxide layers deposited on a window or skylight glazing surface primarily to reduce the U-factor by suppressing radiative heat flow&quot;. By adding this coating we are limiting the amount of radiation that leaves the window thus increasing the amount of heat that is retained inside the window.

=== Spacecraft ===
Shiny metal surfaces, have low emissivities both in the visible wavelengths and in the far infrared. Such surfaces can be used to reduce heat transfer in both directions; an example of this is the multi-layer insulation used to insulate spacecraft.

Since any electromagnetic radiation, including thermal radiation, conveys momentum as well as energy, thermal radiation also induces very small forces on the radiating or absorbing objects. Normally these forces are negligible, but they must be taken into account when considering spacecraft navigation. The Pioneer anomaly, where the motion of the craft slightly deviated from that expected from gravity alone, was eventually tracked down to asymmetric thermal radiation from the spacecraft. Similarly, the orbits of asteroids are perturbed since the asteroid absorbs solar radiation on the side facing the Sun, but then re-emits the energy at a different angle as the rotation of the asteroid carries the warm surface out of the Sun&#x27;s view (the YORP effect).

=== Nanostructures ===
Nanostructures with spectrally selective thermal emittance properties offer numerous technological applications for energy generation and efficiency, e.g., for daytime radiative cooling of photovoltaic cells and buildings. These applications require high emittance in the frequency range corresponding to the atmospheric transparency window in 8 to 13 micron wavelength range. A selective emitter radiating strongly in this range is thus exposed to the clear sky, enabling the use of the outer space as a very low temperature heat sink.

== Health and safety ==

=== Metabolic temperature regulation ===
In a practical, room-temperature setting, humans lose considerable energy due to infrared thermal radiation in addition to that lost by conduction to air (aided by concurrent convection, or other air movement like drafts). The heat energy lost is partially regained by absorbing heat radiation from walls or other surroundings. Human skin has an emissivity of very close to 1.0. A human, having roughly 2m2 in surface area, and a temperature of about 307 K, continuously radiates approximately 1000 W. If people are indoors, surrounded by surfaces at 296 K, they receive back about 900 W from the wall, ceiling, and other surroundings, resulting in a net loss of 100 W. These estimates are highly dependent on extrinsic variables, such as wearing clothes.

Lighter colors and also whites and metallic substances absorb less of the illuminating light, and as a result heat up less. However, color makes little difference in the heat transfer between an object at everyday temperatures and its surroundings. This is because the dominant emitted wavelengths are not in the visible spectrum, but rather infrared. Emissivities at those wavelengths are largely unrelated to visual emissivities (visible colors); in the far infra-red, most objects have high emissivities. Thus, except in sunlight, the color of clothing makes little difference as regards warmth; likewise, paint color of houses makes little difference to warmth except when the painted part is sunlit.

=== Burns ===
Thermal radiation is a phenomenon that can burn skin and ignite flammable materials. The time to a damage from exposure to thermal radiation is a function of the rate of delivery of the heat. Radiative heat flux and effects are given as follows:

== Near-field radiative heat transfer ==

At distances on the scale of the wavelength of a radiated electromangetic wave or smaller, Planck&#x27;s law is not accurate. For objects this small and close together, the quantum tunneling of EM waves has a significant impact on the rate of radiation.

A more sophisticated framework involving electromagnetic theory must be used for smaller distances from the thermal source or surface. For example, although far-field thermal radiation at distances from surfaces of more than one wavelength is generally not coherent to any extent, near-field thermal radiation (i.e., radiation at distances of a fraction of various radiation wavelengths) may exhibit a degree of both temporal and spatial coherence.

Planck&#x27;s law of thermal radiation has been challenged in recent decades by predictions and successful demonstrations of the radiative heat transfer between objects separated by nanoscale gaps that deviate significantly from the law predictions. This deviation is especially strong (up to several orders in magnitude) when the emitter and absorber support surface polariton modes that can couple through the gap separating cold and hot objects. However, to take advantage of the surface-polariton-mediated near-field radiative heat transfer, the two objects need to be separated by ultra-narrow gaps on the order of microns or even nanometers. This limitation significantly complicates practical device designs.

Another way to modify the object thermal emission spectrum is by reducing the dimensionality of the emitter itself. This approach builds upon the concept of confining electrons in quantum wells, wires and dots, and tailors thermal emission by engineering confined photon states in two- and three-dimensional potential traps, including wells, wires, and dots. Such spatial confinement concentrates photon states and enhances thermal emission at select frequencies. To achieve the required level of photon confinement, the dimensions of the radiating objects should be on the order of or below the thermal wavelength predicted by Planck&#x27;s law. Most importantly, the emission spectrum of thermal wells, wires and dots deviates from Planck&#x27;s law predictions not only in the near field, but also in the far field, which significantly expands the range of their applications.

<doc id="185242" wikidata="Q827135" url="?curid=185242" title="Vespers">
<text>Vespers () is a liturgy of evening prayer, one of the canonical hours in Catholic (both Latin and Eastern Catholic liturgical rites), Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Lutheran liturgies. The word for this prayer time comes from the Latin &quot;vesper&quot;, meaning &quot;evening&quot;.

Vespers typically follows a set order that focuses on the performance of psalms and other biblical canticles. Eastern Orthodox liturgies recognised as vespers (, ) often conclude with compline, especially the all-night vigil. Performing these liturgies together without break was also a common practice in medieval Europe, especially outside of monastic and religious communities.

Old English speakers translated the Latin word as , which became evensong in modern English. The term is now usually applied to the Anglican variant of the liturgy that combines vespers with compline, following the conception of early sixteenth-century worshippers that conceived these as a single unit. The term can also apply to the pre-Reformation form of vespers or forms of evening prayer from other denominations.

Vespers is usually prayed around sunset. In Oriental Orthodox Christianity, the office is known as Ramsho in the Indian and Syriac traditions; it is prayed facing the east by all members in these churches, both clergy and laity, being one of the seven fixed prayer times.

==Current use==
===Roman Rite===
Vespers, also called Evening Prayer, takes place as dusk begins to fall. Evening Prayer gives thanks for the day just past and makes an evening sacrifice of praise to God (Psalm 141:1).

The general structure of the Roman Rite Catholic liturgy of vespers is as follows:

* Vespers begins with the singing or chanting of the opening responsory consisting of the verse &quot;Deus, in adiutorium meum intende&quot;, followed by the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot;, and the &quot;Alleluia&quot;. The &quot;Alleluia&quot; is omitted during Lent. This opening formula is common to all the liturgical hours apart from the first of the day where it is replaced by the Invitatory. 
* The appointed hymn (from the hymnaria) is then sung;
* The appointed psalmody is then sung: in the liturgy in general use since 1970 there are two psalms and a New Testament canticle. In older forms of the Roman Office five psalms were sung. Each psalm (and canticle) concludes with a doxology (Gloria Patri) and is preceded and followed by an antiphon. Additionally, most Psalms also have a short caption explaining how the Psalm/Canticle relates to the Church in a Christological or spiritual way; lastly, English translations oftentimes have a psalm-prayer said after the Gloria and before the antiphon.
* After the psalms, there is a reading from the Bible.
* Following the reading, there is a short responsory consisting of a verse, a response, the first half only of the Gloria Patri, and then the verse again.
* The &quot;Magnificat&quot; follows – the canticle of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Luke 1:46–55 – the key daily canticle of Vespers. Like the psalmody, the &quot;Magnificat&quot; is always preceded by an antiphon, and followed by the Gloria and the repeated antiphon. While singing the Magnificat the altar may be incensed, followed by the ministers and the people.&quot;
* The preces (intercessory prayers) are then said, followed by the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, and then the collect (oratio) and blessing.
* The office is sometimes followed by Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.

====First and Second Vespers====
Sundays and solemnities have two Vespers. The church worship day begins in the evening with the setting of the sun or at sunset. This practice follows the tradition of the Old Testament which says in the story of creation: &quot;Evening came, and morning followedthe first day.&quot; (Gen1:5). The solemnity begins with First Vespers prayed around sunset on the day before the observance, with Second Vespers held around sunset on the day itself.

===Byzantine Rite===
The Byzantine Rite has three basic types of vespers: great, daily, and small. Great vespers is used on Sundays and major feast days (those when the Polyeleos is prescribed at matins) when it may be celebrated alone or as part of an All-Night Vigil, as well as on a handful of special days &quot;e.g.&quot;, Good Friday and Pascha afternoon; on certain days of strict fasting when, in theory, fasting before communion should be day-long, vespers also commences the divine liturgy and always commences the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts. Daily vespers is otherwise used. Small vespers, which is seldom used except in monasteries, is a very abbreviated form used only on the afternoon before a vigil and is redundant to the subsequent great vespers, being a placeholder between the ninth hour and compline.

Since the liturgical day begins at sunset, vespers is a day&#x27;s first liturgy and its hymns introduce the day&#x27;s themes.

====Outline====
The general structure of the liturgy is as follows (psalm numbers are according to the Septuagint):
* Vespers opens with a blessing by the priest and then &quot;Come, let us worship ...&quot;; when part of an All-Night Vigil, the blessing that normally begins matins is used; when part of the Divine Liturgy, the blessing that is part thereof is used.
*Proemial Psalm (Psalm 103 (104)): &quot;Bless the Lord, O my soul; O Lord my God, Thou hast been magnified exceedingly...&quot;.
* The &quot;Litany of Peace&quot;.
* A kathisma, a portion of the Psalter is read, or on Saturday evening, when it is the First Kathisma (Psalms 1–8), it is sung, and on major feast, the first third of that (Psalms 1–3) is sung. For about half the year, and for five of the six weeks of Lent, on weekdays, it is the Eighteenth Kathisma (Psalms 119-133 [120-134]).
* The church is censed while &quot;Lord I have Cried&quot; (Psalms 140 (141), 141 (142), 129 (130), and 116 (117)) is sung with stichera (stanzas) about the feast day (or resurrection on a Saturday) inserted between the last several verses.
* The Entrance is made with the censer unless there is a Gospel reading, in which case the Gospel Book is carried.
* The hymn &quot;Phos Ilaron&quot; (&quot;O Gladsome Light&quot;) is recited or sung.
* The Prokeimenon is chanted.
* On feast days, there are three or more readings from the Old Testament, called Prophecies.
* The Litany of Fervent Supplication
* The prayer &quot;Vouchsafe, O Lord&quot;, is read.
* The Litany of Supplication
* On major feast days, a Litiy is inserted. The clergy and the cantors process to the narthex or outside while hymns pertaining to the feastare sung. Then the deacon recites a litany with several long petitions, the response to each petition beings &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; (&quot;Lord, Have Mercy&quot;) many times. The priest ends with a long prayer invoking the intercessions of the saints and the Theotokos.
* The Aposticha are chanted. These are verses that teach about the feast day (or on a Saturday evening, Christ&#x27;s resurrection).
* The Nunc dimittis, the Canticle of St. Simeon (&quot;Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace...&quot;) (Luke ), is read.
* Then are sung the Apolytikia of the day (or an All-Night Vigil on Saturday night the hymn &quot;Rejoice, O Virgin Theotokos&quot;).

* On major feast days, the artoklasia is performed, at which the priest blesses five loaves of bread which have been prepared in the center of the church, together with wheat, wine and oil which are later distributed to the faithful. The beginning of Psalm 33 (34) is then sung.
* The dismissal is given by the priest. If it is an All-Night Vigil this is a simple blessing by the priest; otherwise, it is the full dismissal sequence.

On strict fast days when food and drink are prohibited before vespers, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Christmas Eve, the Annunciation when it falls on a weekday of great lent, or Holy Saturday, Vespers is joined to the Divine Liturgy, functioning in place of the typica as the framework of the hymns of the Liturgy of the Catechumens. After the readings from the Old Testament, the Trisagion is chanted, followed by the Epistle and Gospel, and the Divine Liturgy proceeds normally from that point. On these occasions, as at other times when the Gospel is read at vespers, the Little Entrance is made with the Gospel Book instead of the censer.

The Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts always is similarly combined with Vespers, with the first half of Vespers (up to and including the Old Testament readings) making up a significant portion of the liturgy.

===East Syriac liturgy===

Vespers are known by the Aramaic or Syriac term &quot;Ramsha&quot; in the East Syriac liturgy which was used historically in the Church of the East and remains in use in Churches descended from it, namely the Assyrian Church of the East, the Ancient Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
====Armenian liturgy====
The office of vespers commemorates the hour when &quot;the Son of God descended from the Cross, and was wrapped in the winding sheet, and laid in the tomb.&quot;

Vespers is the only liturgy in the Armenian daily office other than the Morning Service which has hymns proper to the commemoration, feast, or tone assigned to it: a vespers hymn after Psalm 142 (or after Gladsome Light if it is appointed for the day) and the &quot;Lifting-up Hymn&quot; after Psalm 121.

Vespers undergoes a wide range of changes depending on the liturgical season. The following outline contains only some of these variations.

====Coptic Orthodox Church====

In the Coptic Orthodox Church, Vespers refers to a series of liturgies:
# The Vespers Prayer – This is taken from the Canonical Book of Hours. In the liturgical context, the 9th, 11th, 12th and Veil hours are prayed.
# The Vespers Praises – This is taken from the Psalmody and is described in greater detail below.
# The Vespers Raising of Incense

Vespers, as a whole, is an introduction and preparation for the Eucharistic Liturgy, consisting of a collection of prayers, praises and Thanksgiving prayers which request the Lord&#x27;s blessings upon the sacramental liturgy.

The rite of Vespers Praises in the Coptic Orthodox Church is as follows:
# The hymn Ⲛⲓⲉⲑⲛⲟⲥ ⲧⲏⲣⲟⲩ (Psalm 116)
# The Fourth Canticle (Psalms 148, 149, 150)
# The Psali for the day (each day of the week has its own Psali)
# The Theotokion for the day (each day of the week has its own Theotokion)
# The Lobsh or Explanation of the Theotokion
# The reading of the Antiphonary
# On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday: The Conclusion of the Adam Theotokia
# On Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday: The Conclusion of the Batos Theotokia
# Ⲥⲱⲑⲓⲥ ⲁⲙⲏⲛ (Saved Amen.)
# The Lord&#x27;s Prayer

The rite of Vespers Raising of Incense in the Coptic Orthodox Church is as follows:
# The Thanksgiving Prayer – As with all Coptic Orthodox liturgies, Vespers first thanks God &quot;for everything, concerning everything, and in everything&quot;
# Minor Circuit of Incense and Three Inaudible Litanies
# The Verses of the Cymbals
# The Litany for the Departed
# Major Circuit of Incense
# Graciously Accord O Lord...
# The Trisagion
# The Doxologies – commemorating the saints of the church and the liturgical season of the church
# The Creed
# The Prayer of Ⲫⲛⲟⲩϯ ⲛⲁⲓ ⲛⲁⲛ (O God have mercy upon us...)
# The Prayer for the Gospel
# The Reading of the Psalm and Gospel
# The Absolution, Conclusion, and Blessing

====Indian Orthodox Church and Syriac Orthodox Church====

In the Indian Orthodox Church, Vespers (Ramsho) is one of the canonical hours given in the Shehimo.

===Lutheran Church===

Following the Reformation, the form of Vespers in the Lutheran Church remained largely unchanged. First Vespers and Second Vespers of Sundays and major feasts continued to be sung in Latin in many places, while some cathedrals and larger city churches continued singing Vespers in Latin on a daily basis into the eighteenth century.

===In other Christian churches and religious bodies===
Since its inception, the Anglican communion has maintained an evening office, which is called evening prayer (or &quot;evensong&quot;). There are prescribed forms of the service in the Anglican prayer book. The &quot;Anglican Breviary&quot; contains Vespers in English according to the pre-1970 Roman Rite. For information on that service, see above, as in the Roman breviary. The Liberal Catholic Rite also includes Vespers, including the Te Deum as an alternative to the Magnificat.

Daily office books that conform to the historic structure of Vespers have also been published by the Pilgrim Press (The New Century Psalter) and Westminster John Knox Press (Book of Common Worship Daily Prayer). Both publishing houses are affiliated with churches in the Reformed tradition.

From its traditional usage, the term &quot;vespers&quot; has come to be used more broadly for various evening services of other churches, some of which model their evening services on the traditional Latin Catholic form. Presbyterians and Methodists, as well as congregationalist religious bodies such as Unitarian Universalism, often include congregational singing, readings, and a period of silent meditation, contemplation, or prayer.

Some regular community vespers services are completely areligious (or at least are not sponsored by any church) and serve simply as a time for quiet contemplation in the evening hours.

In addition, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, synagogues in the Classical Reform tradition sometimes referred to their Friday evening worship services as &quot;vespers&quot;. Nowadays, such services are instead called &quot;kabbalat shabbat&quot;, which means &quot;welcoming the Sabbath&quot;.

== Historical development==
&quot;This section incorporates information from the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1917. References to psalms follow the numbering system of the Septuagint, and said in the Latin of the Vulgate.&quot;

===Origins===
From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times have been taught; in &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot;, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day &quot;on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight&quot; and &quot;the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ&#x27;s Passion.&quot;

Before the fourth century allusions to the evening prayer are found in the earlier Fathers, Clement I of Rome (&quot;Clemens Romanus&quot;), St. Ignatius, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Origen, the Canons of St. Hippolytus, St. Cyprian. Vespers is, therefore, together with Vigil, the most ancient Office known in the Church.

The Rule of St. Benedict was written about 530–43. A much earlier evening Office corresponds to both Vespers and Compline. Its name varies. John Cassian calls it &quot;Vespertina synaxis&quot;, or &quot;Vespertina solemnitas&quot;. Benedict used the name &quot;vespera&quot; which has prevailed, whence the French word &quot;vêpres&quot; and the English vespers. The name, however, by which it was most widely known during that period was &quot;Lucernalis&quot; or &quot;Lucernaria hora&quot;. It was so called because at this hour candles were lit, not only to give light, but also for symbolical purposes. The &quot;Peregrinatio&quot;, the date of which is probably the 4th century, gives the liturgical order as practised at Jerusalem. The author states that this Office took place at the tenth hour (four o&#x27;clock in the evening); it is really the &quot;Office des lumières&quot;, i.e. of the lights; it was celebrated in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; all the lamps and torches of the church were lighted, making, as the author says, &quot;an infinite light&quot;. In the &quot;Antiphonary of Bangor&quot;, an Irish document of the 6th century, Vespers are called &quot;hora duodecima&quot;, which corresponds to six o&#x27;clock in the evening, or &quot;hora incensi&quot;, or again &quot;ad cereum benedicendum&quot;.

Vespers, then, was the most solemn office of the day and was composed of the psalms called &quot;Lucernales&quot; (Psalm 140 is called &quot;psalmus lucernalis&quot; by the Apostolic Constitutions). Cassian describes this Office as it was celebrated by the monks of Egypt and says they recited twelve psalms as at the vigil (matins). Then two lessons were read as at vigils, one from the Old, and the other from the New Testament. Each psalm was followed by a short prayer. Cassian says the Office was recited towards five or six o&#x27;clock and that all the lights were lit. The use of incense, candles, and other lights would seem to suggest the Jewish rites which accompanied the evening sacrifice (Exodus 29:39; Numbers 28:4; Psalm 140:2; Daniel 9:21; 1 Chronicles 23:30). It may thus be seen that the &quot;Lucernarium&quot; was, together with Vigil, the most important part of the Offices of the day, being composed of almost the same elements as the latter, at least in certain regions. Its existence in the fourth century is also confirmed by St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, St. Basil, St. Ephraem, and, a little later, by several councils in Gaul and Spain, and by the various monastic rules.

=== In the 6th century ===
In the sixth century the Office of Vespers in the Latin Church was almost the same as it has been throughout the Middle Ages and up to the present day. In a document of unquestionable authority of that period the Office is described as follows: The evening hour, or &quot;vespertina synaxis&quot;, is composed of four psalms, a &quot;capitulum&quot;, a response, a hymn, a versicle, a canticle from the Gospel, litany (&quot;Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison&quot;), &quot;Pater&quot; with the ordinary finale, &quot;oratio&quot;, or prayer, and dismissal (&quot;Regula Sancti Benedicti&quot;, xvii). The psalms recited are taken from the series of psalms from Pss. 109 to 147 (with the exception of the groups 117 to 127 and 133 to 142); Pss. 138, 143, 144 are each divided into two portions, whilst the Pss. 115 and 116 are united to form one. This disposition is almost the same as that of the &quot;&quot;Ordo Romanus&quot;, except that the number of psalms recited is five instead of four. They are taken, however, from the series 109 to 147. Here, too, the &quot;capitulum&quot;, versicle, and canticle of the &quot;Magnificat&quot; appear. The hymn is a more recent introduction in the Roman Vespers; the finale (litanies, &quot;Pater&quot;, versicles, prayers) seems all to have existed from this epoch as in the Benedictine &quot;cursus&quot;. Like the other hours, therefore, Vespers is divided into two parts; the psalmody, or singing of the psalms, forming the first part, and the &quot;capitulum&quot; and &quot;formulæ&quot; the second. Vesper time varied according to the season between the tenth hour (4 p.m.) and the twelfth (6 p.m.). As a matter of fact it was no longer the evening hour, but the sunset hour, so that it was celebrated before the day had departed and consequently before there was any necessity for artificial light (&quot;Regula S. Benedicti&quot;, xli). This was an innovation; before this epoch this evening &quot;synaxis&quot; was celebrated with all the torches alight. The reason of this is that St Benedict introduced in the cursus, another hourthat of Complinewhich was prescribed to be celebrated in the evening, and which might be considered as a kind of doubling of the Office of Lucernarium.

=== Office of Vespers in the Middle Ages: variations ===
As has already been remarked, the institution of the office of compline transformed the &quot;lucernarium&quot; by taking from it something of its importance and symbolism, the latter at the same time losing its original sense. St. Benedict called it only &quot;Vespera&quot;, the name which has prevailed over that of &quot;lucernarium&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Ducange, &quot;Glossarium med. et inf. lat.&quot;, &quot;s.v. Vesperae&quot;). The Gallican liturgy, the Mozarabic Liturgy, and, to a certain extent, the Milanese, have preserved the &quot;lucernarium&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Bäumer-Biron, l. c., 358). The Eastern Orthodox Church retains the &quot;Lumen hilare&quot;&quot; and some other traces of the ancient &quot;lucernarium&quot; in the offices of vespers and compline (&quot;cf.&quot; Smith, &quot;Dict. Christ. Antiq.&quot;, &quot;s.v.&quot; Office, Divine). In the Rule of St. Columbanus, dated about 590, Vespers still has twelve psalms, amongst which are Pss. cxii and cxiii, the Gradual psalms, Pss. cxix &quot;sqq.&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Gougaud, &quot;&quot;Les chrétientés celtiques&quot;, 309; &quot;Dict. d&#x27;arch. chrét. et de liturgie&quot;&quot;, &quot;s.v. Celtique&quot;, 3015). The &quot;Antiphonary of Bangor&quot;, a document of Irish origin, gives for vespers Ps. cxii and also the &quot;&quot;Gloria in Excelsis&quot;. For modifications since the 12th century, &quot;cf.&quot; Bäumer-Biron, l. c., II, 54 &quot;sqq.&quot;

=== Changes as of 1917 ===
The decree &quot;Divino afflatu&quot; (November 1, 1911) involves important changes in the old Roman Rite office. There is an entire rearrangement of the psalms (see Reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X) with new ones appointed for each day of the week. These psalms are to be recited with their antiphons, not only at the &quot;Office de tempore&quot; (Sundays and &quot;feriæ&quot;) but also on feasts of a lesser rite than doubles of the second class, that is to say, on simples, semidoubles (double minors), and double majors. On feasts which are doubles of the second class and a fortiori of the first class, as well as on feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Holy Angels, and Apostles, the psalms are proper to the feast as heretofore. On all feasts, of whatever rite, the second part of vespers, that is, the &quot;capitulum&quot;, hymn, antiphon of the &quot;Magnificat&quot;, is taken from the Sanctorale. On semi-doubles and those of a lesser rite the suffrages are now reduced to a single antiphon and orison which is common to all the saints heretofore commemorated, whilst the preces (&quot;Miserere&quot; and versicles) formerly imposed on the greater feriæ are now suppressed.

===Structure: 1917–1969===
The office of Vespers in general use before 1970 continues to be used today by those adhering to the Roman Rite as in 1962 or to earlier versions. The structure of Vespers prior to 1970 is as follows:

* Vespers begins with the singing or chanting of the opening versicles &quot;Deus, in adiutorium meum intende. Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina. Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in principio, et nunc et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. Alleluia.&quot; (O God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, both now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen. Alleluia.) From Septuagesima until Easter, &quot;Laus tibi Domine, Rex aeternae gloriae&quot; (Praise be to Thee O Lord, King of eternal glory) replaces &quot;Alleluia&quot;.
* Five psalms are sung, each concluding with the doxology Gloria Patri. Each psalm is preceded and followed with an antiphon.
* The Little Chapter, a short biblical verse, is read.
* The hymn, which varies according to season and feast, is sung, followed by its versicle and response.
* The &quot;Magnificat&quot;, preceded and followed with an antiphon, is then sung.
* The preces are then said on certain greater ferias.
* The collect of the day is said, followed by commemorations of any concurring feasts according to the rubrics.
* If Compline does not immediately follow, Vespers may end with the seasonal Marian Antiphon.
* The office is frequently followed by Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.

=== Symbolism: the hymns ===
Notwithstanding the changes brought about in the course of time, Vespers still remains the great and important Office of the evening. As already pointed out, it recalls the &quot;sacrificium vespertinum&quot; of the Old Law. In the same manner as the night is consecrated to God by the Office of the Vigil, so also is the end of the day by Vespers. It terminates, as Matins formerly terminated, and Lauds at present terminates, by a lection, or reading, from the Gospel, or &quot;canticum evangelii&quot;, which, for Vespers, is always the &quot;Magnificat&quot;. This is one of the characteristic traits of Vespers, one of the liturgical elements which this particular Office has retained in almost all regions and at all times. There are, however, a few exceptions, as in some liturgies the &quot;Magnificat&quot; is sung at Lauds (&quot;cf.&quot; Cabrol in &quot;Dict. d&#x27;arch. et de liturgie&quot;&quot;, &quot;s.v. Cantiques évangéliques&quot;). This place of honour accorded so persistently to the canticle of Mary from such remote antiquity is but one of the many, and of the least striking, proofs of the devotion which has always been paid to the Blessed Virgin Mary in the Church. The psalms used at Vespers have been selected, from time immemorial, from Pss. cix to cxlvii, with the exception of Ps. cxviii, which on account of its unusual length does not square with the others, and is consequently ordinarily divided up into parts and recited at the little hours. Pss. i to cviii are consecrated to Matins and Lauds, whilst the three last psalms, cxlviii to cl, belong invariably to Lauds. 

The series of hymns consecrated to Vespers in the Roman Breviary also form a class apart and help to give us some hints as to the symbolism of this hour. The hymns are very ancient, dating probably, for the most part, from the 6th century. They have this particular characteristicthey are all devoted to the praise of one of the days of the Creation as described in the Genesis creation narrative, according to the day of the week, thus:

#the first, &quot;&quot;Lucis creator optime&quot;, on Sunday, to the creation of light; 
#the second, &quot;Immense coeli Conditor&quot; on Monday, to the separation of the earth and the waters; 
#the third, &quot;Telluris alme Conditor&quot;, on Tuesday, to the creation of the plants; 
#the fourth, &quot;Caeli Deus sanctissime&quot;, on Wednesday, to the creation of the sun and moon;
#the fifth, &quot;Magnae Deus potentiae&quot;, on Thursday, to the creation of the fish; 
#the sixth, &quot;Hominis supernae Conditor&quot;, on Friday, to the creation of the beasts of the earth; 
#Saturday is an exception, the hymn, &quot;Iam sol recedit igneus&quot;&quot;, on that day being in honour of the Blessed Trinity, because of the Office of Sunday then commencing.

===Solemn Vespers before the Second Vatican Council===
On weekdays that are not major feasts Vespers features hardly any ceremonies and the celebrant wears the usual choir dress. However, on Sundays and greater feasts Vespers may be solemn. Solemn Vespers differ in that the celebrant wears the cope, he is assisted by assistants also in copes, incense is used, and two acolytes, a thurifer, and at least one master of ceremonies are needed. On ordinary Sundays only two assistants are needed while on greater feasts four or six assistants may be used. The celebrant and assistants vest in the surplice and the cope, which is of the color of the day. The celebrant sits at the sedile, in front of which is placed a lectern, covered with a cloth in the color of the day. The assistants sit on benches or stools facing the altar, or if there are two assistants, they may sit at the sedile next to the celebrant (the first assistant in the place of the deacon and the second assistant in place of the subdeacon).

The celebrant and assistants follow the acolytes into the church wearing the biretta. Upon arriving in the sanctuary the acolytes place their candles on the lowest altar step, after which they are extinguished. The celebrant and assistants kneel on the lowest step and recite the &quot;Aperi Domine&quot; silently, after which they go to their places and recite the &quot;Pater noster&quot; and &quot;Ave Maria&quot; silently. A curious practice which exists from ancient times is the intoning of the antiphons and psalms to the celebrant. The rubrics presuppose that the first assistant or cantors will intone all which the celebrant must sing by singing it to him first in a soft voice after which the celebrant sings it again aloud. The five antiphons and psalms are sung with the first assistant intoning the antiphons and the cantors intoning the psalms. During the singing of the psalms all sit. After the psalms, the acolytes relight their candles and carry them to each side of the lectern for the chapter. The assistants follow, standing facing each other in front of the lectern. The celebrant then sings the chapter, after which all return to their places. The first assistant intones the hymn to the celebrant, and all stand while the hymn is sung. The first assistant intones the &quot;Magnificat&quot; to the celebrant, who sings the first line aloud. The celebrant and the first two assistants go to altar, and the altar is then incensed as at Mass while the first two assistants hold the ends of the cope. Other altars in the church may be incensed as well. The first assistant then incenses the celebrant, after which the thurifer incenses the others as at Mass. If there are commemorations, the acolytes and assistants again go to the lectern as described above for the chapter. The choir sings the antiphons, the cantors sing the versicles, and the celebrant sings the collects. After all commemorations, the celebrant sings &quot;Dominus vobiscum&quot;, the cantor sings &quot;Benedicamus Domino&quot;, and the celebrant sings &quot;Fidelium animae...&quot;. The Marian antiphon is said in the low voice. Especially in English-speaking countries, Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament often follows Solemn Vespers.

==Musical settings==

The psalms and hymns of the Vespers liturgy have attracted the interest of many composers, including Claudio Monteverdi, Antonio Vivaldi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Anton Bruckner. (Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s &quot;Vespers&quot; is really a setting of the Eastern Orthodox all-night vigil; calling it &quot;Vespers&quot; was an error in judgement made by a translator.)

<text>Adana is a large city in southern Turkey. The city is situated on the Seyhan River, inland from the northeastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is the administrative seat of the Adana province, and has a population of 1.8 million, making it the largest city in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey.

Adana lies in the heart of Cilicia, which was once one of the most important regions of the classical world. Home to six million people, Cilicia is an important agricultural area, owing to the large fertile plain of Çukurova.

Adana is a centre for regional trade, healthcare, and public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are important parts of the economy.

The city is connected to Tarsus and Mersin by TCDD train.

The closest public airport is Çukurova International Airport.

==Etymology==
The name Adana (; ; ) has been used for over four millennia, making it one of the oldest continuously used place names in the world; the first mention of Adana came in Hittite tablets of around 2000 BC. It has had only minor pronunciation changes despite changing political control.

One theory holds that the city name originates from an Indo-European expression &quot;a danu&quot; &#x27;on the river&#x27;, using the same Proto-Indo-European root as the Danube, Don, Dnieper and Donets.

Greco-Roman legend suggests that the name of Adana originates from &quot;Adanus&quot;, the son of the Greek god Uranus, who founded the city next to the river with his brother &quot;Sarus&quot;, whose name was given to the river. An older legend, in Akkadian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian and Hittite mythologies, attributes the name to the storm and rain god, Adad, who lived in the surrounding forests. Hittite manuscripts found in the area reported the legend. The locals had great admiration for the god and called the region Uru Adaniyya (&quot;Adana Region&quot;) in his honour. The city inhabitants were called Danuna.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the city is mentioned as Adana. For a brief period during the Hellenistic era, it was known as Ἀντιόχεια τῆς Κιλικίας (&quot;Antioch of Cilicia&quot;) and as Ἀντιόχεια ἡ πρὸς Σάρον (&quot;Antioch on the Sarus&quot;). On some cuneiform tablets, the city name was given as Quwê, while some other sources call it Coa which could be the place where Solomon obtained his horses according to the Bible (I Kings 10:28; II Chronicles 1:16).

It is also sometimes suggested that the name is related to the Danaoi, the name for Greeks of the Trojan War in Homer and Thucydides.

Under Armenian rule, the city was known as Ատանա (Adana) or Ադանա (Atana).

According to Ali Cevad&#x27;s &quot;Memalik-i Osmaniye Coğrafya Lügat&quot; (&quot;Ottoman Geographical Dictionary&quot;), the Muslims of Adana attributed the city&#x27;s name to Ebu Süleym Ezene, who was appointed as Wāli by Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid.

Other Ottoman and Islamic sources call the city &quot;Edene&quot;, &quot;Azana&quot; and &quot;Batana&quot;.

==History==
Adana is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia, with a history going back for eight millennia, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. The history of the Tepebağ tumulus dates back to the Neolithic, to around 6000 BC, the time of the first human settlements. A place called &quot;Adana&quot; is mentioned by name in the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh.

===Bronze Age===
The first people known to have lived in Adana and the surrounding area were the Luwians. They controlled the Mediterranean coast of Anatolia roughly from 3000 BC to around 1600 BC.

Then the Hittites took over the region which came to be known as Kizzuwatna. Inhabited by Luwians and Hurrians, Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under Hittite protection, but they had a brief period of independence from the 1500s to 1420s BC. According to the Hittite inscription of Kava, found in Hattusa (Boğazkale), Kizzuwatna was ruling Adana, under the protection of the Hittites, by 1335 BC. With the collapse of the Hittite Empire around 1191–1189 BC, native Denyen sea peoples took control of Adana and the plain until around 900 BC.

===Iron Age===
Then Neo-Hittite states were founded in the region with the Quwê state centred on Adana. Quwê and other states were protected by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, though they had periods of independence too. After the Greek migration into Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the Mopsos dynasty and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries found in Mopsuestia (modern Yakapınar) were written in hieroglyphic Luwian and Phoenician. The Assyrians took control of the regions several times before their collapse in 612 BC.
Cilicians founded the Kingdom of Cilicia in 612 BC with the help of Syennesis I. The kingdom was independent until the invasion of the Achaemenid Empire in 549 BC, then became an autonomous satrapy of the Achaemenids until 401 BC. The uncertain loyalty of Syennessis during the rebellion of Cyrus the Younger led Artaxerxes II to abolish the Syennesis administration and replace it with a centrally appointed satrap. Archaeological remains of a procession reveal the existence of Persian nobility in Adana.
Alexander the Great entered Cilicia through the Cilician Gates in 333 BC. After defeating the Persians at the Battle of Issus, he installed his own satrap, Balacrus, to oversee the region&#x27;s administration. His death in 323 BC marked the beginning of the Hellenistic era, as Greek replaced Luwian as the language of the region. After a short time under Ptolemaic dominion, the Seleucid Empire took control of the region in 312 BC. Adanan locals adopted a Greek name - &quot;Antioch on Sarus -&quot; for the city to demonstrate their loyalty to the Seleucid dynasty. The adopted name and the motifs illustrating the personification of the city seated above the river-god &quot;Sarus&quot; on the city&#x27;s coins, suggest a special appreciation of the rivers which were a strong part of the Cilician identity. The Seleucids ruled Adana for more than two centuries until they were weakened by a civil war which led them to offer allegiance to Tigranes II, the King of Armenia who conquered a vast part of the Levant. Cilicia became a vassal state of the Kingdom of Armenia in 83 BC and new settlements were founded by Armenians in the region.

===Romano-Byzantine era ===

The Roman general Pompey took over the whole of Cilicia and organised it as a Roman province in 64 BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during this period, while nearby Tarsus and Anazarbus were more important metropolises. During the era of Pompey, the city was used as a prison for the pirates who frequently ravaged the Cilician coast and disrupted trade. A bridge over the Sarus (Taşköprü) was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a on a Roman military road leading to the East.

In the early period of Roman rule, Zoroastrianism, that had been introduced to the region by the Persians, was still observed in Cilicia as was Judaism which attracted many sympathisers. As home to some of the earliest Christian missionary efforts, Cilicia welcomed Christianity more easily than some other provinces.

After the permanent partitioning of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the Adana area became a part of the Byzantine Empire, and was probably developed during the time of Julian the Apostate. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantations, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important regional trade centres. 

Adana became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of an autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the Third Council of Constantinople, but before its listing in a 10th-century &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot; as an archdiocese. The Bishop Paulinus participated in the First Council of Nicaea in 325. Piso was among the Arianism-inclined bishops at the Council of Sardica (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to orthodoxy and signed the profession of Nicene faith at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the First Council of Constantinople in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint John Chrysostom. Cyrillus was at the Council of Ephesus in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434. Philippus took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and was a signatory of the joint letter of the bishops of Cilicia Prima to Byzantine Emperor Leo I the Thracian in 458 protesting at the murder of Proterius of Alexandria. Ioannes participated in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680. No longer a residential bishopric, Adana is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

=== Period of Byzantine and Islamic rivalry ===

At the Battle of Sarus in April 625, Heraclius defeated the forces of Shahrbaraz of the Sasanian Empire that were stationed on the east bank of the river, after a fearless charge across the bridge built by the Emperor Justinian (now Taşköprü). During the reign of Caliph Omar, Muslims who are commanded by Khalid ibn Walid, launched columns to raid Cilicia, going as far as Tarsus, in the autumn of 638. The Byzantines defended the region from the encroaching Islamic Caliphates throughout the 7th century, but it was finally conquered in 704 by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik. Under Umayyad rule, Cilicia became a no man&#x27;s land frontier between Byzantine Christian and Arab Muslim forces. In 746, profiting from the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V took control of Adana. The Abbasid Caliphate took over rule of the region from the Byzantines after Al-Mansur became caliph in 756. Under Abbasid rule, Muslims started settling in Cilicia for the first time.

Abandoned for more than fifty years, Adana was garrisoned and re-settled from 758 to 760. So that it could form a thughūr on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonised by the Turkic Sayābija tribe from Khorasan. The city saw rapid economic and cultural growth during the reigns of Harun al-Rashid and Al-Amin. Abbasid rule continued for more than two centuries until the Byzantines retook control of Adana in 965. The city became part of the Seleucia theme. After the great Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the emperor Romanos IV Diogenes was removed from the throne by a coup. He then gathered an army to regain power but was defeated and had to retreat to Adana. There he was forced to surrender after receiving assurances of his personal safety.

=== Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia ===
Suleiman ibn Qutulmish, the founder of the Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate, annexed Adana in his campaign in 1084. During the Crusades, Cilicia had been criss-crossed by invading armies until it was eventually captured by the forces of the Armenian Principality of Cilicia in 1132, under its king, Leo I. It was retaken by Byzantine forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it again in around 1170. During the Armenian era, Adana continued as a centre for handicrafts and international trade as part of an ancient network from Asia Minor to North Africa, the Near East and India. Venetian and Genoese merchants frequented the city to sell goods imported through the port at Ayas. In 1268, the devastating Cilicia earthquake destroyed much of the city and eighty years later, in 1348, the Black Death reached the region and caused severe depopulation. Adana remained part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was lost to the Turkmen supporting the Mamluk Sultanate who Cilicia captured the plain.

===Ramadanid Emirate===

The Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, Ayas and Sarvandikar (Savranda), and left the administration of the plain of Adana to Yüreğir Turks who had already formed a Mamluk authorised &quot;Türkmen Emirate&quot; in the Camili area, just southeast of Adana, in 1352. The Emir, Ramazan Bey, designated Adana his capital, and led the Yüreğir Turks as they settled the city. The Ramadanid Emirate, was &quot;de facto&quot; independent throughout the 15th century as a result of being a thughūr in Ottoman-Mamluk relations. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the emirate into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The Ramadanid Beys held onto the administration of the new Ottoman Sanjak of Adana by a hereditary title until 1608.

=== Ottoman and Egyptian eras ===

The Ottomans terminated the Ramadanid administration in 1608 after the Celali rebellions and began direct rule from Constantinople through an appointed Vali. In late 1832, the Vali of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, invaded Syria, and reached Cilicia. The Convention of Kütahya signed on 14 May 1833 ceded Cilicia to the &quot;de facto&quot; independent Egypt. At that time, the Sanjak of Adana&#x27;s population of 68,934 had hardly any urban services. The first neighbourhood (Verâ-yı Cisr) east of the river was founded and Alawites were brought from Syria to work in the flourishing agricultural lands. İbrahim Paşa, the son of Muhammad Ali Paşa, demolished Adana Castle and the city walls in 1836. He built the first canals for irrigation and transportation and also built a water system for the residential areas of the town, including wheels that raised the water of the river for public fountains. After the Oriental crisis, the Convention of Alexandria signed on 27 November 1840 required the return of Cilicia to Ottoman sovereignty.

The American Civil War that broke out in 1861 interrupted the flow of cotton to Europe and European cotton traders turned their attentions to fertile Cilicia. Adana had developed as a hub for cotton trading and had become one of the most prosperous Ottoman cities. New Armenian, Turkish, Greek, Chaldo-Assyrian, Jewish and Alawite neighbourhoods were founded around what had been a walled city. The Adana–Mersin railway line opened in 1886, connecting Adana to international ports through the port in Mersin.

By the turn of the 20th century, further migration attracted by large-scale industrialisation grew Adana&#x27;s population to over 107,000: That population was made up of 62,250 Muslims (Turks, Alawites, Circassians, Kurds), 30,000 Armenians, 9,250 Assyrians (many of whom were Chaldean Catholics), 5,000 Greeks, 500 Arab Christians and 200 internationals.

====Adana massacre of 1909====

In the early 20th century the local economy thrived and the Armenian population doubled as people fled the Hamidian massacres. When the revolution of July 1908 brought about the end of Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s autocratic rule, the Armenian community felt empowered to imagine an autonomous Cilicia. The CUP&#x27;s post-revolution mismanagement of the vilayets caused the pro-diversity Vali Bahri Pasha to be removed from office in late 1908. He was replaced by the weak Cevad Bey. Taking advantage of this, Bağdadizade Abdülkadir (later Paksoy), the local leader of the Cemiyet-i Muhammediye, took almost complete control of the local government and led an action plan to &quot;punish&quot; Armenians throughout Cilicia. Rumours of an upcoming Armenian attack, raised tension in the Turkish neighbourhoods. As soon as news of the countercoup reached Cilicia, enraged members of the Cemiyet-i Muhammediye and dissatisfied peasants left out of work by mechanisation flocked to the city on market day. After staying overnight in the city, the groups and their local supporters started attacking Armenian shops on the morning of 14 April 1909. Later in the day the attacks were also directed at Armenian dwellings and spread to the rest of Cilicia. Armed Armenians defended themselves and the clashes lasted until April 17.
After a week of silence, 850 soldiers from regiments of the Ottoman Army arrived in the city on April 25. Shots were fired at the campground and a rumour immediately spread that the Armenians had opened fire from a church tower. Without even investigating the rumour, the military commander Mustafa Remzi Pasha directed soldiers and bashi-bazouks towards the Armenian quarters and for three days they shot people, destroyed buildings and burned down Christian neighbourhoods. The pogroms of 25–27 April were on a much greater scale than the clashes of 14–17 April, and almost all the casualties were Christian.

The Adana massacre of April 1909 resulted in the deaths of 18,839 Armenians, 1,250 Greeks, 1,272 Assyrians and 620 Muslims. Adding in the roughly 2,500 Hadjinian and other seasonal workers who disappeared, the death toll in the entire Vilayet is estimated to have been around 25,500. Over the summer 2,000 children died of dysentery and a few thousand adults died of injuries or from epidemics. The massacre orphaned 3,500 children and caused heavy destruction of Christian properties. Cevad Bey and Mustafa Remzi Pasha were sacked and given light sentences for abuse of power, and on 8 August 1909, Djemal Pasha was appointed the new Vali. He quickly rebuilt relations with the surviving Armenian community and gathered financial support to found a new neighbourhood for Armenians called &quot;Çarçabuk&quot; (now Döşeme). He also ordered the construction of two orphanages and the restoration of destroyed buildings.

The Cilicia section of the Berlin–Baghdad railway had opened in 1912, connecting Adana to the Middle East. Within a few years, the city had regained its momentum and by the turn of 1915, the Armenian population numbered up to 30,000, not far short of the figure from before 1909.

====Armenian genocide====
Early in May 1915, Vali Ismail Hakkı Bey received an order from Constantinople (now İstanbul) to deport the Armenians of Adana. The Vali was able to delay the deportations and let the Armenians sell their movable assets to acquire money for the journey. The first convoy of deportees consisting of more than 4,000 Armenians left the city on May 20. The Catholicos of Cilicia, Sahak II, wrote a letter to Djemal Pasha, the then Syria-Cilicia General Vali to prevent further deportations and the chief secretary Kerovpe Papazian met the pasha in Aley in Lebanon in early June and delivered the message of the Catholicos. Djemal Pasha immediately wired the Vali ordering him not to deport more Armenians. As a result of his efforts, the Adana Armenians earned a stay of execution for the summer, while the rest of the Cilician Armenians were being deported and hundreds of thousands of exhausted Armenian deportees from Western Anatolia were passing through the city. Armenian intellectuals Rupen Zartarian, Sarkis Minassian, Nazaret Daghavarian, Harutiun Jangülian, and Karekin Khajag, who were deported from Constantinople on April 24th, were kept in custody in the Vilayet offices for a few days. They failed to be able to arrange a meeting with the Catholicos at the Cathedral, their last attempt at survival. Later in June, two prominent leaders, Krikor Zohrab and Vartkes Serengülian, were also kept in the city during their final journey towards Diyarbakır.

The Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, wanted to end the exemption of Adana Armenians and sent his second in command, Ali Munif, to the city in mid-August to order the resumption of the deportations. Ali Munif immediately deported 250 families who were accused of insurrection. Before the remaining Armenians were deported, the Vali again arranged for them to sell their assets. As almost a third of the city&#x27;s residents were selling their belongings, the city must have seemed like the site of a massive clearance sale. The deportation of 5,000 Armenian families in eight convoys started on 2 September 1915 and continued until the end of October. One thousand craftsmen, state officers and army personnel and their families were exempted from deportation. Unlike the deportees of other Vilayets, many of Adana&#x27;s Armenians were sent to Damascus and further south, thereby avoiding the death camps of Deir ez-Zor, at the request of Djemal Pasha. During the course of the Armenian genocide, the death rate of the roughly 25,000 Armenians deported from Adana in 1915 was a lot lower than that of deportees from other regions for three main reasons: there were no reports of direct killings in and around the city; many were deported to the Damascus area; and some had money to keep them going.

===French rule===


The Armistice of Mudros, signed on 30 October 1918, ended Ottoman participation in World War I. The terms of the armistice ceded control of Cilicia to France. In December the French government sent four battalions of the Armenian Legion to take over Adana and oversee the repatriation of more than 170,000 Armenians to Cilicia. Returning Armenians negotiated with France to establish an autonomous &quot;State of Cilicia&quot; and Mihran Damadian, the chief negotiator for the Armenians, signed a provisional &quot;Constitution of Cilicia&quot; in 1919. Pre-war life resumed with the re-opening of churches, schools, cultural centres and businesses.

However, the French forces were spread thinly across Cilicia and the villages to which people returned came under attack from the Turkish Kuva-yi Milliye. The costs and difficulties associated with the repatriation process, and growing Arab nationalism within the Syria mandate forced the French High Commissioners to meet the Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal Pasha, several times in late 1919 and early 1920, resulting in a halt to the deployment of extra forces to Cilicia. A truce arranged on 28 May 1920 between the French and the Kemalists, led the French forces to retreat south of the Mersin-Osmaniye railroad. The subsequent evacuation of thousands of Armenians from Sis and its environs and their migration to Adana raised the number of Armenians in the city to more than 100,000. Throughout June, the Armenian Legion, along with repatriated Armenians and Assyrians, committed vengeful acts against the Turks, killing hundreds around Kahyaoğlu, Kocavezir, Camili and İncirlik. On 10 July 1920, to ease the overpopulation south of the railroad, a Franco-Armenian operation forced the local Turkish population to escape north. Roughly 40,000 Turks from Adana and around fled to the countryside and to the mountains north, an event known as the &quot;Kaç Kaç&quot; incident, which lasted for four days and claimed hundreds of lives. The Turkish Cilician Society () and national defence associations then met at a congress in Pozantı on 5 August 1920 to re-establish Turkish rule over Cilicia. On the same day, Mihran Damadian declared the autonomy of Cilicia by coming to an agreement with the city&#x27;s Christian communities. However, the French government did not recognise its autonomy, expelled the community leaders and disbanded the Armenian Legion in September.

As the political environment changed, the French abandoned all claims to Cilicia, which they had originally hoped to attach to their mandate over Syria. On 9 March 1921, the Cilicia Peace Treaty was signed between France and the Turkish Grand National Assembly. However, it did not achieve its intended goals and was replaced by the Treaty of Ankara, signed on 20 October 1921. Under the terms of this agreement, France recognised the end of the Cilicia War and agreed to withdraw provided that the Christian communities&#x27; rights were protected. Those Armenians who were not satisfied with such guarantees rushed to Mersin port and Dörtyol, and had evacuated their homeland of two millennia by December 1921. The French troops together with the remaining Armenian volunteers then withdrew from the city on 5 January 1922.

In 1922, up to 10,000 local Greeks moved to Greece before the policy of Greco-Turkish population exchange took effect. Among the 172,000 Armenians in the Adana area just before the Cilicia Evacuation, 80,000 took refuge in Syria or Lebanon while up 10,000 of them migrated to Cyprus, Izmir and Istanbul. The remained 82,000 or so Armenians most likely remained in the Adana area and assimilated into Turkish/Muslim society. Armenians who settled in Lebanon founded the &quot;Nor Adana&quot; (English: New Adana) neighbourhood within the mostly Armenian town of Bourj Hammoud, north-east of Beirut. From the 1920s onwards, around 60 percent of Cilician Armenians moved to Argentina. An informal census of 1941 revealed that 70 percent of all the Armenian Argentines in Buenos Aires had Adana origins.

===Modern Turkey===

On 15 April 1923, just before the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, the Turkish government enacted the &quot;Law of Abandoned Properties&quot; which confiscated the properties of Armenians and Greeks who were not present there. Adana became one of the cities with the most confiscated property, which meant that muhacirs (immigrants) from the Balkans and Crete, as well as migrants from Kayseri and Darende were resettled in the Armenian and Greek neighbourhoods, with more modest pieces of land, houses and workshops distributed to them. The large farms, factories, stores and mansions were granted to Kayseri notables (e.g. Nuh Naci Yazgan, Nuri Has, Mustafa Özgür) and to local nationalists (e.g. Sefa Özler, Ali Münif) as promised at the Sivas Congress by Mustafa Kemal (later Atatürk). Within a decade, the city experienced drastic demographic change, socially and economically, and turned into an almost entirely Muslim/Turkish city. The remaining Jews and Christians were hammered by the burden of the Wealth Tax in 1942, causing most to leave Adana, selling their properties at way below their actual value to families like the Sabancıs, who built their wealth on such confiscated or undervalued properties.

On 27 June 1998, the city was hit by a 6.2 magnitude earthquake which killed 145 and left 1500 people wounded and many thousand homeless in the city centre and in Ceyhan district. The economic loss was estimated at about US$1 billion.

On 6 February 2023, Adana was one of the major cities in Southern Turkey affected by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake.

==Geography==
Adana is located on the 37th parallel north on the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, occupying the center of the Cilician plain (); a relatively large stretch of flat, fertile land that lies southeast of the Taurus Mountains.

The Seyhan (likely from ) divides Adana into its two metropolitan districts, and is the main source for Adana&#x27;s fertile alluvial soils, while also being responsible for the region&#x27;s proclivity to regular winter and spring floods, which affected the city until embankments were built in the 1900s. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power, along with plans to irrigate the lower Çukurova plain more regularly than the floodplain could naturally provide. Therefore, two irrigation channels now flow into the plain, crossing the city centre from east to west.

Heading west across Cilicia from Adana, the path to Tarsus crosses the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly while passing through the Cilician Gates (), a rocky mountain pass functioning as the main artery to the Turkish hinterland.

===Climate===

Adana has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) under the Köppen classification, and a dry summer subtropical climate (&quot;Cs&quot;) under the Trewartha classification. Winters are mild and wet. Frost does occasionally occur at night almost every winter, but snow is a very rare phenomenon. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. During heatwaves, the temperature often reaches or exceeds . The highest recorded temperature was on 13 August 2023 at . The lowest recorded temperature was on 20 January 1964 at . 
==Governance==
Adana Metropolitan Municipality covers an area of around the City Hall. Four levels of government are involved in the administration of the city; national, provincial, metropolitan and district municipalities.The Government of Turkey in Ankara holds most of the power: health, education, the police and many other city-related services are administered by Ankara through an appointed Governor. The national government is also the lawmaker, adjudicator and auditor of all the other levels of government and the neighbourhood administration. Municipal governance is run via a two-tier structure: the Metropolitan Municipality forms the upper tier and the district municipalities form the lower tier. The Metropolitan Municipality takes care of construction and the maintenance of major roads and parks, and operates local transit and fire services. The district municipalities are responsible for neighbourhood streets, parks, garbage collections and cemetery services. The district municipalities are further divided into neighbourhoods (mahalle) administrations, the smallest administrative units of the city.

===Metropolitan municipality===
Adana Municipality was incorporated in 1871 though the city continued to be governed under the muhtesip system until 1877 by the first mayor Gözlüklü Süleyman Efendi. Modern municipal governance began with the second mayor Kirkor Bezdikyan and his successor Sinyor Artin. Roads were widened and paved with cobblestones, drainage canals and trenches were cut, and the first municipal regulations were put into effect. After the founding of the republic in 1923, major infrastructure projects were carried out and the first planned neighbourhoods were built to the north of the city. Turhan Cemal Beriker served as mayor and governor from 1926 to 1938. With the completion of the Seyhan Dam in 1956, the city saw explosive growth and the then prime minister Adnan Menderes showed special interest in Adana, initiating large-scale infrastructure projects like citywide underground sewer systems and rezoning residential areas. Since 1984, the cityscape has seen great change with the revitalisation of the Seyhan river and the construction of large parks and boulevards.

Metropolitan Municipality Law was introduced in 1989 when municipal governance was split between the metropolitan municipality and the district municipalities. Adana Municipality became the Metropolitan Municipality and two new district municipalities - Seyhan and Yüreğir - were founded. Karaisalı was annexed to the city in 2006, while the Çukurova and Sarıçam districts were founded in 2008 by partitioning the Seyhan and Yüreğir districts. On 3 February 2012, Karataş Municipal Council agreed to amalgamate with Adana, hence Karataş will become the city&#x27;s sixth district after the transition process is complete.

The Metropolitan Municipality consists of three organs: the Metropolitan Council, the Mayor and the Encümen or Executive Committee. Each district municipal council elects one-fifth of their members to represent it at the metropolitan council. Thus, the metropolitan council consists of 35 councillors, ten from Seyhan district, eight from Yüreğir, eight from Çukurova, six from Sarıçam, two from Karaisalı and the metropolitan mayor who is elected directly by the voters. The executive committee consists of ten members, five being metropolitan councillors and the other five directors at the metropolitan hall who are appointed by the metropolitan mayor.

===Districts===

The City of Adana consists of the urban areas of the four metropolitan districts; Seyhan, Yüreğir, Çukurova and Sarıçam. Seyhan district is fully within the city limits whereas the Yüreğir, Çukurova and Sarıçam districts have rural areas outside the city.

Seyhan district, west of the Seyhan River, is the city&#x27;s cultural and business centre. The D-400 state road (also called Turhan Cemal Beriker Boulevard within the city limits) divides the district into north and south. Seyhan north of the D-400 is the most economically developed part of the city. Hotels, cultural centres, commercial and public buildings line the D-400. The Old Town to the south of the D-400 is the shopping district with a mixture of traditional and modern shops. South of the old town is a low-income residential area.

Çukurova district is a modern residential district that lies north of Seyhan district and south of the Seyhan Reservoir. It was planned in the mid-1980s to direct the urban sprawl towards land north of the city. Called New Adana, the project consisted of 200,000 homes including villas along the lake shore and high-rise apartment blocks along the wide, newly opened boulevards of Turgut Özal, Süleyman Demirel and Kenan Evren.

Yüreğir district, east of the river, consists mainly of large-scale industry and low-income residential areas. With the construction of new bridges over the river and the extension of the metro line, Yüreğir became increasingly important, with the Adana Court of Justice re-locating to the district and a 47.5-hectare health campus planned for the Kazım Karabekir neighbourhood. An extensive urban redevelopment plan will also convert the Sinanpaşa, Yavuzlar, Köprülü and Kışla neighbourhoods into modern residential areas.

The district of Sarıçam lies north and east of Yüreğir and consists of former municipalities that were amalgamated into the City of Adana in 2008. Some of the city&#x27;s larger institutions are in Sarıçam such as Çukurova University, the İncirlik Air Base and the Organised Industrial Region.

===Neighbourhoods===
Individual neighbourhoods (mahalle) are administrative units within the district municipalities and are administered by the muhtar (headman) and the Neighborhood Seniors Council. Although elected by the neighbourhood residents, the muhtar is not granted any powers but functions as an administrator of the national government. The muhtar can raise neighbourhood issues with the district municipality and has a seat at the Adana City Assembly, an umbrella organisation for the coordination of public institutions in the city. Even though neighbourhood administrations cannot provide social services nor provide funding to increase the involvement of residents in local issues, many residents still identify strongly with their neighbourhoods.

There are a total of 254 neighbourhoods in the city. Seyhan has 99 neighbourhoods, 69 of them in the original urban area and 30 in the neighbourhoods of the former municipalities and the former villages that were converted into neighbourhoods. Yüreğir has 99 neighbourhoods, 38 in the urban area and 61 in the rural. There are 29 neighbourhoods in Sarıçam, 16 neighbourhoods in Çukurova and 11 in Karaisalı district. A neighbourhood population can range from 150 to 63,000. Some neighbourhoods, especially in the Çukurova district, are very large—almost the size of a town—making access to muhtars difficult.

Tepebağ, Kayalıbağ, Kuruköprü, Sarıyakup and Alidede are the historical neighbourhoods of Adana. The planned neighbourhoods of the Republican era - Reşatbey, Cemalpaşa, Kurtuluş and Çınarlı - form the core of the city&#x27;s cultural life. Güzelyalı, Karslılar and Kurttepe are scenic neighbourhoods overlooking the Seyhan reservoir.

==Economy==
A major centre for grain and cotton production in the Ottoman period, Adana was one of Turkey&#x27;s first industrialised cities and is now one of its most economically developed cities. A mid-size trading city until the mid-1800s, the city attracted European traders after the United States, a major cotton supplier, became embroiled in its Civil War. Cilician farmers exported agricultural products for the first time and started building up capital. By the start of the 20th century, factories, almost all of them processing cotton, began to operate here. The coming of the Republic accelerated industrialisation as closed plants were re-activated and state-owned plants opened. With the construction of the Seyhan Dam and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s. Large-scale industry grew up along the D-400 highway and the Karataş road. A service industry, especially banking, developed during this period. Rapid economic growth continued until the mid-1980s and movie makers were attracted to the region.

Extensive neo-liberal policies adopted by then Prime Minister Turgut Özal to centralise Turkey&#x27;s economy caused almost all the Adana-based companies to move their headquarters to Istanbul. The decline in cotton planting raised the cost of raw material for manufacturing, and the city saw a wave of plant closures starting from the mid-1990s. Young professionals fled the city, contributing to Adana&#x27;s unenviable status as the country&#x27;s top brain drain city. Financial and human capital flight from Adana has continued to increase since 2002 due to the government&#x27;s neo-liberal centralisation policies similar to Özal&#x27;s. In 2010, unemployment in the city reached a record 19.1 percent. After 20 years of stagnation, Adana&#x27;s economy is starting to pick up again with investments in the tourism and service industries, and the wholesale and retail sectors, and the city is being re-shaped as a regional centre.

Adana was named among the 25 &quot;European Regions of the Future&quot; for 2006/2007 by &quot;Foreign Direct Investment&quot; magazine. Chosen alongside Kocaeli, Adana scored the highest points for cost effectiveness against Kocaeli&#x27;s points for infrastructure development, while the two towns tied for points in the categories of human resources and quality of life.

===Commerce===
A leading commercial centre in southern Turkey, Adana hosts the regional headquarters of many corporate and public institutions. TÜYAP Exhibition and Congress Center hosts fairs and business conferences, and is currently the main meeting point for businesses in Çukurova. The academic oriented 2000-seater Alper Akınoğlu Congress Center is expected to open in 2012 at Çukurova University campus.

The Adana Chamber of Commerce (ATO) was founded in 1894 to guide and regulate the cotton trade and it is one of the oldest of its kind in Turkey. Today the Chamber has more than 25,000 member companies, and furthers the interests of businesses and advocates on their behalf. The Adana Commodity Exchange, founded in 1913, functions mainly to organise the trade in agricultural produce and livestock. It is located opposite the Metropolitan Theatre. According to the Patent Registrar, an original Adana kebab is made only by a vendor who has successfully passed an inspection conducted on the spot by the Adana Chamber of Commerce.
The designation of the coastal areas of Ceyhan and Yumurtalık districts as Energy-specific Industrial Areas has made Adana an attraction for hotel building. Current 5-star hotels of the city, Hilton, Seyhan and Sürmeli will be complemented by Sheraton and Türkmen hotels on the river bank, Ramada and Divan hotels in the city center, Anemon hotel at the west end which are all currently under construction.

===Agriculture===
Adana is the marketing and distribution centre for the Çukurova agricultural region, where cotton, wheat, corn, soy bean, barley, grapes and citrus fruits are produced in great quantities. Adana&#x27;s farmers produce half of Turkey&#x27;s corn and soy beans. Thirty-four percent of Turkey&#x27;s peanuts and 29 percent of Turkey&#x27;s oranges are harvested in Adana. Most of the local farming and agricultural-based companies have their offices in Adana. Producer co-operatives play a significant role in the city&#x27;s economy. Çukobirlik, Turkey&#x27;s largest co-operative producer, has 36,064 members in ten provinces and does everything from planting to the marketing of cotton, peanuts, soybeans, sunflowers and canola.

The Adana Agriculture Fair is the region&#x27;s largest fair attracting more than 100,000 visitors from twenty nations. It hosts agriculture, livestock, poultry and dairy businesses. A Greenhouse and Gardening Fair takes place at the same time as the Agriculture Fair which is organised on a 3.5-hectare area of the TÜYAP Exhibition Center every October.

===Manufacturing===
Adana&#x27;s large-scale industry is mostly centred on agriculture. Food processing and fabricating metal products are major industries, making up 27 percent of Adana&#x27;s manufacturing, but furniture and rubber/plastic product manufacturing plants are also numerous. , Adana has eleven companies in Turkey&#x27;s top 500 industrial firms. The largest company in Adana, Temsa Global, an automotive manufacturer, has more than 2500 employees and manufactures 4000 buses annually. Marsan-Adana is the largest margarine and plant oil factory in Turkey. Advansa Sasa is Europe&#x27;s largest polyester manufacturer employing 2650. The Organised Industrial Region of Adana covers an area of 1225 hectare with 300 plants, most of them medium-scale.

==Demographics==
As of 31 December 2024, the total population of the four districts which composes the Adana metropolitan area was 1,816,750. 

Two-thirds of Adana&#x27;s residents live west of the Seyhan River, where the city was first founded. East of the river urban sprawl has been restricted by large institutions such as Çukurova University and the Incirlik Air Base.

According to Evliya Çelebi, during the 17th century, the town was mostly composed of Turkomans but also included Arabs, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews.

An Ottoman tax register from 1526 records sixteen Turkish and one Armenian residential area. During the 17th century more Armenians and Greeks settled in the city.

The demographics of the city changed significantly in the 1990s after the massive migration of Kurds, many of them having been forced to leave their villages in the southeast at the peak of the Turkey–PKK conflict. The Conos, a tribe of Romani people of Romania, settled in Adana during the Balkan Wars; today they mainly live around the Sinanpaşa neighbourhood. Around 8,000 Romani people live in Adana Province. There is also a sizeable community of migrants from the Balkans and Caucasia, who settled in Adana before and during the Balkan Wars.

There were 172,000 Armenians in the Adana area in 1921, just before the Cilicia Evacuation. Around 82,000 of them were not sent into exile which explains why they remained in Adana and assimilated into Turkish society. Ten thousand to 15,000 of the descendants, who are known as Crypto-Armenians, still practise their Armenian/Christian culture behind closed doors. There are also many descendants of the Armenian children given to orphanages or to Muslim families for fostering in 1909 and 1915. Altogether, Adana may have the largest number of assimilated Armenians in contemporary Turkey. Adana is home to a community of around 2,000 British and Americans serving at NATO&#x27;s Incirlik Air Base. Before 2003, the community numbered up to 22,000 but it declined after many troops were stationed in Iraq.

As with other cities on the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts, Adana has a strong secularist population. Amongst the people of faith, the majority of Turks, most of the Kurds and some of the Arabs are Sunni Muslim. Adana is also a stronghold of Alevism, many Alevis having moved to the city from Kahramanmaraş after the Maraş Massacre of 1978. Most of the Arabs of Adana are Alawites and often confused with Alevis. Alawite Arabs are known locally as Nusayri or &quot;Fellah&quot;. Adana also has a tiny community of Roman Catholics and a few Jewish families.

==Local attractions==
===Architecture===

The first traces of settlement in the quarter of Tepebağ, can be traced to the Neolithic Age. The quarter is next to the Taşköprü stone bridge and on a hill which gave it its name Tepebağ, meaning &#x27;garden on the hill&#x27;. The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the Ottoman houses near the river. A house where Atatürk stayed on Seyhan Caddesi now houses the Atatürk Museum.

Adana&#x27;s golden age for architecture was the late 15th and 16th centuries when the Ramadanid principality chose it as their capital. The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighbourhoods and most of the historical landmarks being built during this period. Thus Mamluk and Seljukid styles of architecture are dominant in Adana&#x27;s architectural history. Taşköprü is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, while a few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule.

=== Mosques ===

The Ulu Cami, a külliye built in 1541 during the Ramadanid era, is the most interesting medieval mosque to survive in Adana along with its medrese and türbe. The mosque is made from black and white marble with decorative window surrounds and is famous for the 16th century Iznik tiles lining the interior. The minaret features unique Mamluk decoration and an orthogonal floor plan.

The Yağ Camii was originally built as the Church of St. James, then converted into a mosque by Ramazanoğlu Halil Bey in 1501. His successor Piri Mehmet Paşa added its minaret in 1525 and its medrese in 1558. It is in the Seljukid Grand Mosque style and has an attractive gate made of yellow stone.

The Yeni Camii (New Mosque) was built in 1724 by Abdülrezzak Antaki, and is still known to some as the Antaki Mosque. The influence of Mamluk architecture is visible. A rectangular building, it has interesting stonework on its south walls.

The Alemdar Mescidi, Şeyh Zülfi Mescidi, Kızıldağ Ramazanoğlu Mosque and Hasan Aga Camii (a 16th-century wooden mosque constructed without using nails) are also of historic value.

The huge and prominent Sabancı Merkez Camii (Sabancı Central Mosque) on the west bank of the Seyhan river is Adana&#x27;s most visited mosque and one of the largest mosques in the Middle East. Built following Ottoman architectural traditions, the mosque was opened in 1998 to accommodate up to 28,500 worshippers. It has six minarets, four of them 99 meters high. Its dome has a diameter of 32 meters and is 54 meters above the prayer hall. Near the Seyhan Bridge, the mosque is visible over a wide area.

=== Museums and art galleries ===
Adana Archaeological Museum originally opened in 1924 as one of Turkey&#x27;s first ten museums. It moved to the west corner of Seyhan Bridge in 1972. The museum exhibits archeological works from all over the Çukurova. Notable exhibits include two statues of Augustus, the Achilles Sarcophagus depicting the Trojan War and statues found in the ancient cities of Magarsus and Augusta. In 2019 it moved to a completely new location in an abandoned textiles factory. A mosaic from Misis (Yaprakpınar) depicting Noah and twenty-three birds that he took into the Ark during the Flood has been moved into the new museum which also exhibits works excavated from the Misis Tumulus.

Adana Ethnography Museum opened inside a converted church in 1983. The courtyard contains the epitaphs and gravestones of Adana&#x27;s leading figures of the 17th century. The interiors exhibits clothing, jewellery and weaponry of Yörük (nomadic) villagers.

The Atatürk Museum focuses on the War of Independence and the first years of Republic in a mansion where Atatürk stayed during his trips to Adana.

Other museums, several of them in restored historic buildings, include the Karacaoğlan Museum of Literature, the Adana Museum of Cinema, the Yeşiloba Martyrs&#x27; Museum, the Mehmet Baltacı Museum of Photography and the Adana Urban Museum.

The State Fine Arts Gallery opened in the Sabancı Cultural Centre in 1982. Other public art galleries include the 75.Yıl Art Gallery in Atatürk Park, the Adana City Hall Art Gallery and the Art Gallery in the Seyhan Cultural Centre.

=== Bridges ===
Of the bridges crossing the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable is the Taşköprü, a 2nd-century Roman bridge. Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was, until 2007, the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorised vehicles. Demirköprü is a railway bridge that was built in 1912 as part of the Berlin-Baghdad Railway project. Regülatör bridge, at the southern section of the city, is a road bridge as well as a regulator for the river water. There are also three footbridges, Seyhan and Mustafakemalpaşa road bridges, the bridge of the metro and the bridge of the motorway spanning the river.

=== Turkish Baths (Hamams) ===
The Çarşı Hamam (&quot;Turkish bath of the Bazaar&quot;) was built in 1529 by Ramazanoğlu Piri Pasha and is Adana&#x27;s largest hamam. It has five domes and the interior is faced with marble. At the time it was built, water used to be brought from the Seyhan River using a sequence of canals and water wheels.

The Irmak Hamam (&quot;Turkish bath of the River&quot;), next to the Seyhan District Hall, was built in 1494 by Ramazanoğlu Halil Bey over the ruins of an ancient Roman bath. Its water comes from the river. Other historical hamams in the city are Mestenzade Bath and Yeni Bath.

=== Churches ===

Nineteenth century Adana had four churches, two Armenian, one Greek Orthodox and one Roman Catholic. The Roman Catholic Saint Paul Church (Bebekli Kilise) was built in 1870 and is in the old town, close to 5 Ocak Square. It currently serves the Roman Catholic and Protestant communities.

The Agios Nikolaos (St Nicholas) Greek Orthodox Church was built in 1845 in the Kuruköprü area but was converted into a museum in 1950. It was reconsecrated as a church in 2015 and renamed the Kuruköprü Monumental Church.

The Armenian Church on Ali Münif Street, midway between the Yağ Camii and the Büyük Saat, was converted into a branch of the Ziraat Bank during the Republican Era. Surp Asdvadzadzin Armenian Apostolic Church on Abidinpaşa Street, which was in service until 1915, was used as a cinema until 1970 then demolished by the government. The Central Bank (Merkez Bankası) regional headquarters was built in its place.

=== Parks and gardens ===
Adana has many parks and gardens. Owing to the warm climate, they are open all year round without the need for winter maintenance.

Paths along both banks of the Seyhan river track the city from the south end to the Seyhan Reservoir. The path then joins up with the wide sidewalks of Adnan Menderes Boulevard which follows the southern shores of the Seyhan Reservoir, thereby extending the path to the west end of the reservoir. The most scenic stretch is Dilberler Sekisi on the west bank between the old and new dams. A path along the north side of the Grand Canal goes from the east end to the west end of the city, crossing the Seyhan river. Once completed, the network of paths within the city will cover almost , connecting several parks.
The Merkez Park (Central Park) is a 33-hectare urban park on both banks of the Seyhan river, just north of the Sabancı Merkez Mosque. With a 2100-seater amphitheatre, a Chinese Garden, a Rowing Club and two cafes, it is the city&#x27;s main recreational area.

The Süleyman Demirel Arboretum is a large botanical garden containing collections of woody plants intended partly for scientific study by Çukurova University researchers. The arboretum is also used for recreational purposes by city residents. 512 species of plants can be found in the arboretum.

Atatürk Park is a 4.7-hectare city park built during the first years of the Republic in the central commercial district of the city. The park holds a statue of Atatürk and hosts public ceremonies.

Çobandede Park is a 16.5-hectare park on a hill overlooking the Seyhan Reservoir. It contains the tomb of Çoban Dede, a wise man from Karslı Village.

The Yaşar Kemal Woods serves as a hiking area on the eastern bank of the Seyhan river opposite Dilberler Sekisi. It is dedicated to the Çukurova-born writer Yaşar Kemal.

Çatalan Woods is a large recreational area between the Çatalan and Seyhan reservoirs in the Karaisalı district north of the city.

=== Other Attractions ===
The Büyük Saat (&quot;Great Clock Tower&quot;), built by the governor of Adana in 1882, is Turkey&#x27;s tallest clock tower, rising high. It was damaged during the French occupation, but was rebuilt in 1935, and its image appears on the city&#x27;s coat of arms. The Kazancılar Çarşısı (Cauldron-makers Bazaar) grew up around the Büyük Saat.

Ramazanoğlu Hall was built in 1495 during the reign of Halil Bey. A three-story building, made of stone and brick, it is one of the oldest houses to survive in Turkey. The existing hall was the Harem section of the property where the Ramadanid family lived. The Selamlık section, which contained the government offices, has been lost.

== Society and culture ==
One of the defining features of Adana is its agriculture-based life and the agriculture-based industrial culture associated with it. However, developments in industrial life, improvements in transportation, the effects of mass communication and large-scale migration have affected Adana&#x27;s culture. As in other Turkish cities, the culture in different sections of the city is often very different from that in other areas.

==Cuisine==

The , simply called &quot;kebap&quot; locally, is made from minced meat and is the most popular dining choice in the city. Since it can be found in all kebab restaurants in Turkey and in most Turkish restaurants around the world, the Adana name is still associated with the kebab for many people.
Adana kebab is usually served with an onion salad, green salad or a well-chopped tomato salad. Rakı or şalgam (turnip juice) usually accompany it.

There are many salads typical to Adana. Radish salad with tahini is very popular and is found only in the Çukurova region. Şalgam and pickle juice are the preferred drinks for winter with aşlama (licorice juice) replacing them in summer.

A sweet called Seker Sucugu (Sweet Sausage) originated in Adana where it was invented by Sir Duran O. during the First World War, around 1915.

Alongside tomato paste, pepper paste is used in almost every dish. 

The city is also famous for its &quot;Şırdan&quot; a kind of sausage stuffed with rice and eaten with cumin.

The city is also known for &quot;paça&quot;, boiled sheep&#x27;s feet and &quot;bicibici&quot; (pronounced as bee-jee-bee-jee) made from jellied starch, rose water and sugar and served with crushed ice especially in the summer. The city also offers a number of famous desserts, such as &quot;Halka Tatlı&quot;, a round-shaped dessert, and &quot;Taş Kadayıf&quot;, a bow-shaped dessert. Several types of fruit, including the apricot, are native to this area.

===Nightlife===

During the mid-20th century, Adana was well known for its vibrant nightlife and many which mostly functioned as adult entertainment clubs, similar to the Japanese hostess clubs, with live music and a lounge with tables lined up on the ground floor and private rooms upstairs. The first opened before 1942 with the arrival of Englishmen who worked on the Adana-Ulukışla road that was funded by the British Government in an effort to persuade Turkey to join World War II. By the 1950s landowners who had grown wealthy from the cotton trade opened more and more &quot;pavyons&quot; along the Seyhan river. In the 1960s, rapid industrialisation brought more patrons from across the country, including from Istanbul and Ankara, and Adana was dubbed the Pavyon Capital of Turkey. Many popular singers owed their fame to the Adana .

The &quot;pavyons&quot; led the way for Western-style pubs and nightclubs by the late 1980s as Adana underwent big socio-economic changes. The traditional entertainment district was Sular, near the Central Station, but nowadays pubs and clubs are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs are mostly along the river and around the lake. There are still two active , Afrodit and Maksim, but now most adult entertainment is directed at what is known locally as tele-bars which are licensed as regular pubs but function as places where bargirls entertain customers. There are around twenty tele-bars mainly in the city centre and around the old dam.

A hundred-year-long tradition of dining on kebab, liver and rakı in the Kazancılar Bazaar, with street music and dancing, turned into a festival with all-night entertainment in 2010. The World Rakı Festival, officially renamed the Adana Kebab and Şalgam Festival, is held on the second Saturday night of December and attracts more than 20,000 people to the old town.

===Sports===
Athletic sport life had progressed in Cilicia with the coaches that were invited to Adana from Istanbul in the early 20th century. Varag Pogharian and Mateos Zarifian played an important role in organising the athletic movement and the first sports clubs in the city were founded by the Armenian community. In 1913, Adana Türkgücü was founded by Ahmet Remzi Bey and İsmail Sefa Bey in alliance with the Istanbul Türkgücü club that had been initiated by the Committee of Union and Progress. Adana&#x27;s athletic clubs joined the Cilician Olympic Games held in April 1914 at a venue north of Dörtyol, a first of its kind for the region. In the 1920s, Adana İdman Yurdu, Adana Türk Ocağı, Seyhanspor and Milli Mensucat clubs were all founded and joined the Adana Football League that was established in 1924 along with clubs from other Cilician provinces. Adanaspor, founded in 1932, and Adana Demirspor, founded in 1940, later joined the Adana League.

Football is the most popular sport in Adana although basketball, volleyball and handball are also played widely at professional and amateur levels. Warm weather makes the city a haven for sports like rowing, sailing, swimming and water polo. Horse racing and horse riding are also popular. The biannual Men&#x27;s European Wheelchair Basketball Championship took place in Adana on 5–15 October 2009; twelve countries competed and Italy won the title after a final game against Turkey. Adana also hosted the 2013 IWBF Men&#x27;s U23 Wheelchair Basketball World Championship. The 1967 Women&#x27;s European Volleyball Championship was organised in Turkey with Adana a host city along with Istanbul, Ankara and İzmir. Group C games are played in Adana at the Menderes Sports Hall.


Adanaspor and Adana Demirspor are the two Adana clubs that appear in the Turkish Professional Football League. After twelve years, Adanaspor returned to the Super Lig, in which they had competed for twenty-one years and were the runner up in the 1980–81 season. Adanaspor also performed at the UEFA Cup for three years. Adana Demirspor, currently performing in the TFF First League, was the runner up for the Turkish Cup in the 1977–1978 season and performed in the SuperLig for seventeen years. Both teams use the 5 Ocak Stadium, and matches between them are known as the Adana derby, creating an arch-rival atmosphere found in only three cities in Turkey. Kiremithanespor of the Yüreğir district compete in the Turkish Regional Amateur League. In women&#x27;s football, Adana Demirspor compete in the Women&#x27;s Super League.

Adana ASKİ is the major club for Women&#x27;s Pro-Basketball, performing in the Turkish Women&#x27;s Basketball League (TKBL). Adana ASKİ was founded as Ceyhan Belediyespor in 2000, and was renamed and moved to Adana in 2014. After the move, the club had its best season ever (2014–15), playing in the final of the Turkish Women&#x27;s Cup and the semi-final of the TKBL First Division. Adana ASKİ also play their home games at Menderes Sports Hall. Adanaspor, relegated to the third tier of the Turkish Men&#x27;s Basketball League in 2016, play their home games at the Menderes Sports Hall. Wheelchair basketball clubs Adana Engelliler and Martı Engelliler play in the first division of the Turkish Wheelchair Basketball League, both playing their home games at the Serinevler Sports Hall.

Professional volleyball club Adana Toros was promoted to the top flight of the Turkish Men&#x27;s Volleyball League on 12 April 2016 at the play-off finals in Bursa. Adana Toros play their home games at the Menderes Sports Hall. The city&#x27;s handball club, Şakirpaşa HEM, was promoted to the Turkish Women&#x27;s Handball Super League on 21 April 2016, at the play-off finals in Ankara. The venue of Şakirpaşa is Yüreğir Serinevler Arena.
Water sports are also popular in Adana. Adana Demirspor&#x27;s water polo team is a legend in the community, joining the Turkish Water Polo League in 1942 after Turkey&#x27;s first modern watersports venue, the Atatürk Swimming Complex, opened in Adana in 1936. The team has a record twenty-two years of straight championship titles in the Turkish Men&#x27;s Water Polo League, seventeen years of it without losing a game, hence their nickname &quot;The Unbeatables&quot;. Demirspor has a total of twenty-nine championship titles.

Rowing became a popular local sport in the last twenty years. Rowing competitions are held all year long on the Seyhan River and the Seyhan Reservoir. The Metropolitan Rowing Club and Çukurova University SK compete at the national and international level. Sailing competitions are also held at the Seyhan Reservoir all year round. The Adana Sailing Club competes at regattas in different categories. In swimming, Erdal Acet of Adana Demirspor is a prominent local figure, who broke the record for swimming the English Channel in nine hours and two minutes in 1976. Recreationally, the lack of swimming pools make the Seyhan River and the irrigation canals attractive for swimmers who want to cool off in the hot, humid summers. With almost one hundred people drowning every year, the Metropolitan Municipality has now opened forty-one swimming pools.

The Adana Half Marathon was inaugurated in 2011 on a national level with the participation of 223 athletes. In 2012, the marathon gained IAAF International Marathon status and hosted 610 athletes from ten nations. The marathon takes place on the first Sunday after 5 January, Adana&#x27;s Independence Day. The route follows Adana&#x27;s historic streets and the streets along the Seyhan river.

Horse racing is very popular in Adana. Yeşiloba Hippodrome is one of four Turkish racecourses to host horse racing competitions from October to May. Adana Equestrian Club is Turkey&#x27;s biggest horse riding centre, hosting national and international competitions.

===Shopping===

Çakmak Street is the traditional shopping street in the old town. Attempts to pedestrianise it have been unsuccessful because traffic flow can&#x27;t be diverted. There are several historical bazaars around the Büyük Saat (Clocktower) and Yağ Camii (Oil Mosque). The covered markets around Saydam street, and the Kilis and Mısır bazaars used to be centres for shopping for quality foreign goods.

Ziyapaşa Boulevard is an elegant street where expensive brand-name shops are located. It runs from the D-400 state road to the Central Train Station with the shops are concentrated towards the north end. The streets around Ziyapaşa and the Özal, Demirel and Evren boulevards in northern Adana also feature high-end shops.

Adana has four modern shopping malls. Galleria was the first to be built in the early 1990s. The M1 and Carrefour malls were built during the late 1990s at the west end of the city. Recently opened Optimum Outlet is the first mall east of the river and the closest to the city centre. It has a view of the river and the Merkez (Central) Park.

==Education==

=== Schools ===
Public, private and not-for-profit institutions are located in Adana. Primary and secondary education in the city is regulated by the provincial directorate of the national Ministry of Education which also administers the state schools.

There are 282 public and 12 private primary schools which pupils attend from grades 1 to 8. From grades 9 to 11, pupils go to one of the 85 public and 26 private high schools. Notable high schools of the city with entrance exams include the state-owned Adana Fen and Adana Anadolu High Schools, and the private Gündoğdu and Bilfen High Schools. The Adana Gundogdu Schools is the largest private school in Adana and expands every year. There are six public and six private schools for pupils with special needs. Nine Community Training Centres help adult residents improve their skills.

Although the city has large Kurdish and Arab communities education in &quot;unofficial&quot; languages is only provided at institutions that do not get government support. Few of them teach Arabic or Kurdish.

The requirement to pass an entrance exam for admission to high schools and universities and for a career in the civil service led to the opening of more than one hundred crammer schools () in the city.

===Libraries ===
The Ramazanoğlu Library was founded in 1923 by combining two smaller libraries. It moved to its current location in the Sabancı Cultural Centre in 1976 and was renamed the Adana Public Library. It also has a branch in the Karacaoğlan Museum of Literature. Seyhan, Yüreğir, Sarıçam and Karaisalı also have public libraries administered by each district. Adana City Library specialises in publications about Adana and Çukurova&#x27;s history and culture, and has a good collection of photography and films about the city. It is located in the Adana Centre for Arts and Culture.

=== Fairs ===
The fifth Çukurova Book Fair took place in 2012, hosting 182,450 visitors from Çukurova and neighbouring regions. More than two hundred publishers and volunteer organisations had stands, more than 50 cultural events were performed and 300 authors were present to meet their readers. At the same time, the Çukurova Education Fair was organised at the Tüyap Exhibition Centre with the participation of 45 education institutions.

===Universities===
There are two state universities and one foundation university inside the city and another foundation university just outside it. Universities are regulated by the Council of Higher Education (YÖK).

Çukurova University is a state university located on the eastern shore of the Seyhan Reservoir. In 2008, it was ranked one of the top 500 universities in the world according to research conducted by Blackwell Publishing, Quacquarelli Symonds and &quot;The Times&quot;. It was founded in 1973 following the merger of the colleges of Agriculture and Medicine. Its campus has many cultural, social and athletic facilities for its 40,000 students.

Adana University for Science and Technology is a newer state university with nine faculties, two institutions and a college.

Çağ University is a not-for-profit tuition-based university founded in 1997. It is outside the city centre on the way to Tarsus. Most of its 2,500 students commute from Adana, Tarsus and Mersin.

Kanuni University is a recently opened, tuition-based university founded by the Çukurova Education and Culture Foundation.

==Healthcare==
Adana is a major health centre for a wide area stretching from the Mediterranean to Southeastern Anatolia. It has four university hospitals, eight state hospitals and seven private hospitals.

In the Hastaneler (Hospitals) part of the Seyhan district hospitals - including the Numune General Hospital, the Çukurova State Hospital, the Hospital for Thoracic Diseases and the Military Hospital - line up on both sides of H. Ömer Sabancı Street.

Part of Çukurova University, Balcalı Hospital is a research hospital that was founded in 1987 after the Faculty of Medicine moved to the main campus. It has 1050 inpatient beds in 47 service units, a 58-bed intensive care unit and a 17-bed emergency unit. The largest hospital in Southern and Southeastern Anatolia, it is also one of the biggest hospitals of Turkey.

A new health campus is expected to open in Yüreğir by 2014, which will include a 600-bed General Hospital, 200-bed Heart and Stroke Hospital, 250-bed maternity hospital, 100-bed oncology hospital, 150-bed Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Centre and 100-bed Psychiatry Hospital. The campus will have a capacity of 1400 inpatients and will be connected to the Hastaneler area via a bridge over the Seyhan river which will create one big campus.

==Transportation==
In the 16th century, Adana was a port city where ships could navigate along the Seyhan River to the port just south of Taşköprü. It is now on the main route connecting Europe to the Middle East.

===Intercity transport===

Adana’s closest airport is Çukurova International Airport, located 34km (21mi) from the city centre. It is the sixth busiest airport in Turkey. There are international flights to major cities of Germany, to Beirut, Jeddah, London, Amsterdam, Brussels, Moscow and Nicosia (TRNC), and frequent domestic flights to Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Antalya, Trabzon, Bodrum and Van.

Turkish State Railways (TCDD) runs five long-distance lines connecting Adana to Ankara, Kayseri, Karaman, Konya and Elazığ. All these lines use the Central Railway Station while some also use the city&#x27;s other railway stations—Şehitlik and Şakirpaşa stations to the west, Kiremithane, İncirlik and Yakapınar stations o the east. TCDD also runs three regional lines across Çukurova. The Adana-Mersin Line operates as a commuter train with 27 trains daily. Services to Osmaniye–Islahiye and to İskenderun run once a day. Regional trains stop at all city stations.

Although they became less popular as private airlines introduced inexpensive flights, buses are still the main form of transport to and from the city. Adana has two intercity bus terminals offering services to almost all Turkey&#x27;s towns and cities. Bus companies travelling to cities west of Adana depart from the Central Bus Terminal while buses travelling to cities east of Adana depart from Yüreğir Bus Terminal. A shuttle service runs between the two terminals. Regional bus and minibus services from Adana to other places in Çukurova are plentiful. Extra summer bus services operate to the high plains of Tekir, Bürücek and Kızıldağ to enable Adana residents to escape the city heat.

There is an extensive motorway network (O50-O59) connecting Adana to as far as Erdemli in the west, Niğde in the north, Şanlıurfa in the east and Iskenderun in the south. It can take as little as 40 minutes to get to Mersin and two hours to reach Gaziantep.

===Local transport===
Local transport is provided by the Adana Transit Corporation (a division of the Metropolitan Municipality) and by dolmuş and bus co-operatives. The Transit Corporation runs the Metro and the municipal buses.

Adana Metro is a rapid transit system that extends from the north-west to the city centre and Yüreğir. The Metro M1 line has thirteen stations and can transport 21,600 passengers an hour in each direction, a complete journey taking twenty minutes. A planned second line will run from Akıncılar to Çukurova University in the Sarıçam District. It will be long and will have seven stations..The Metro will eventually cover and serve 20 stations.

The Adana Transit Corporation also operates 229 bus services, eight of them designed specifically for disabled users. Payment is collected via a Kentkart smartcard system. Six Bus Co-operatives (known as Can buses) operate another 411 buses also using the Kentkart. Eighteen dolmuş co-operatives, with a total of 1,086 minibuses, provide services even to minor streets.

===Cycling and walking===
Adana is mostly flat and the warm weather makes it convenient for year-round cycling and walking. Cycling from one end of the city to the other usually takes less than 40 minutes. Although there are no bike lanes there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpaşa Boulevard. When compared to cities like İzmir, Konya and Eskişehir, Adana is less bicycle friendly.

Car-oriented urban planning has become even more extreme since the 1980s, with pedestrians finding parts of the sidewalks of popular streets converted into car parks. Adana has almost no car-free streets or squares. There are plans to convert both ends of Taşköprü (the Stone bridge) into squares and to widen the overcrowded sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk. By far the most pedestrian-friendly street is Turgut Özal Boulevard although Kenan Evren and other major streets in the Çukurova district are also convenient for walking.

<text>Tiswas (; an acronym of &quot;Today Is Saturday: Watch And Smile&quot;) was a British children&#x27;s television series that originally aired on Saturday mornings from 5 January 1974 to 3 April 1982 and was produced for the ITV network by ATV.

It was created by ATV continuity announcer Peter Tomlinson (later to become a regular presenter on the show) following a test period in 1973 when he tried out a few competitions and &quot;daft stuff&quot; between the programmes.

==Overview==

&quot;Tiswas&quot; began life as a &#x27;links&#x27; strand between many &#x27;filler&#x27; programmes, such as cartoons and old films. The popularity of the presenters&#x27; links soon eclipsed the staple diet of filler.

The correct meaning of the Tiswas initials – &quot;Today Is Saturday: Watch And Smile&quot; – was confirmed by &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; host Chris Tarrant on the &quot;Tiswas Reunited&quot; special of 2007, although &quot; Today Is Saturday: Wear A Smile&quot; had also been often cited, albeit incorrectly. &quot;Tiswas&quot;, as a word meaning &quot;A state of nervous agitation or confusion ... physical disorder or chaos&quot;, is attested from 1960 by the Oxford English Dictionary.

It was originally produced as a Midlands regional programme by ATV, and was first broadcast live on 5 January 1974. The then federal structure of ITV, with its independent regional companies, meant that not all of these stations broadcast the show when it became available for networked transmission. Over time most ITV regions chose to broadcast it, with Granada Television and Southern Television being among the last to pick up the show, in 1979, the year of the ITV technicians’ strike. Tyne Tees and Ulster eventually decided to take &quot;Tiswas&quot; for its final series in 1981.

Most famously hosted by Chris Tarrant between 1974 and 1981, and later Sally James, it also featured Lenny Henry and occasionally Jim Davidson together with Bob Carolgees and his puppet, Spit the Dog. John Gorman, former member of 1960s cult band The Scaffold, was also a presenter. On the programme, Birmingham folk-singer and comedian Jasper Carrott was to introduce the nation to the &quot;Dying Fly Dance&quot;. Like its cleaner BBC counterpart, &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;, it had a running order but no script (with the exception of some specific sketches). The programme was broadcast from Studio 3 at ATV Centre in Birmingham; this was the weekday home for the company&#x27;s regional news magazine, &quot;ATV Today&quot;.

The show was a stitch-together of competitions, film clips and pop promos, just about held together by sketches and links from the cast. The show also regularly featured spoofs of BBC children&#x27;s programming.

A feature of &quot;Tiswas&quot; was &quot;The Cage&quot; wherein initially the child audience, later their parents and, finally, members of the public were confined and periodically doused in water (one spin-off of the series was the hit &quot;The Bucket of Water Song&quot;, performed by the Four Bucketeers). This became so popular that the 100th show (broadcast from the Hednesford Hills Raceway) featured several hundred fans lining the racetrack whilst a fire-engine of the local brigade drove around the track and hosed them down with water.

Another feature of &quot;Tiswas&quot; was its spoof gardening segment &quot;Compost Corner&quot;, which Chris Tarrant later revealed was a ruse to get an audience callback in the style of &quot;Crackerjack&quot;. This feature regularly featured Lenny Henry – complete with khaki shorts; Hawaiian shirt; and ginger fake beard – performing an impersonation of David Bellamy, with gardening-based puns and jokes.

Lenny Henry also performed a regular slot of Newsflashes as Trevor McDoughnut – an impersonation of ITN newsreader Trevor McDonald – in which he performed news-based puns and jokes, punctuated by buckets of water being thrown at him. Henry also regularly performed an impersonation of Tommy Cooper, in which he either told a joke (which often ended with the &quot;Phantom Flan Flinger&quot; – standing behind Henry – slapping two flans into either side of Henry&#x27;s head); or performed a spoof magic trick.

From the fourth series onwards, the series was frequently visited by the &quot;Phantom Flan Flinger&quot;, who would throw custard pies (&quot;flans&quot;), buckets of water, gunge, sprayers, etc. around the studio at all and sundry. Both Tarrant and the Flan Flinger would take great delight in trying to &#x27;flan&#x27; cameramen who would go to great lengths to avoid being hit.

=== The logo ===
The original logo featured the word &quot;TISWAS&quot; in chunky letters. A later version of this logo featured a circle going round the edge with &quot;Today Is Saturday Watch And Smile&quot; embossed upon it. The classic &quot;zig-zag&quot; logo designed by Stuart Kettle appeared in 1977 – this initially featured a mechanical bird flying above it, but later, Chris Wroe (who drew all of the classic caricatures of the &quot;Tiswas&quot; team) replaced this with a drawing of the Phantom Flan Flinger.

==Timeline==
===Series 1 (1974)===
The first series was intended to be eleven episodes, purely acting as links between the usual staple fillers of old films and cartoons that ATV would transmit on Saturday mornings. Presented by Chris Tarrant and John Asher from merely a desk in a continuity studio, the pair had to rely on ad-libs and jokes sent in by viewers. Within a few weeks, the show was moved to studio 3 at ATV Centre (a studio usually reserved for amongst other programmes, the news magazine programme, &quot;ATV Today&quot;) from which Tiswas was produced for the majority of its run.

Due to an industrial dispute by technicians at ATV, this initial run was only nine programmes in length, but was so well-received that a second series was commissioned.

Billed in &quot;TV Times&quot; as &quot;Today Is Saturday or the Tis-was Show&quot;, the title sequence features both &quot;Today Is Saturday&quot; and the original &quot;Tiswas&quot; chunky letters logo, shown over a background very similar to that of &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;. The sequence featured clips from various films and Disney cartoons, backed by a funky jazz number known as &quot;Atomic Butterfly&quot; (which also seems to have been used for &quot;Sports Arena&quot;, an HTV Wales sports programme in the early 1970s).

===Series 2 (1974-1976)===
The presenting team was doubled to four presenters, and these were usually culled from ATV&#x27;s presentation department. Chris Tarrant and John Asher retained their roles as the main presenters, although John would leave during this series. From the ranks at ATV, other regular presenters were established, notably sports reporter Trevor East (later director of sport at Setanta Sports) and announcer Peter Tomlinson (later to become managing director of &quot;Saga Radio West Midlands&quot; and High Sheriff of the West Midlands).

Producer Peter Harris left the show in the summer, to help produce fellow cult TV success &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; at ATV&#x27;s London-orientated operation in Elstree.

===Series 3 (1976-1977)===
Chris Tarrant, Peter Tomlinson and Trevor East were the main presenters. Almost all these shows were produced by Sid Kilbey. The 2 April 1977 show was a landmark edition, as part of the programme was broadcast outside the Midlands for the first time, on HTV Cymru Wales and HTV West, filling up their &#x27;round-the-regions&#x27; compilation of Saturday morning programmes called &quot;Ten on Saturday&quot;.

===Series 4 (1977-1978)===
This series marked an end to the provincial micro-budget shows of the previous series, as the initial edition of this series brought significant changes. Sally James was drafted in as the series&#x27; first regular female presenter. She had been the presenter of a regional Saturday morning show in London called &quot;Saturday Scene&quot;, produced by LWT. Comedian Jim Davidson was intended to be a regular presenter but left after only a few editions, although he would return for cameo appearances. Peter Tomlinson was axed as a regular, which came as a surprise to him.

Chris Tarrant was retained as the anchor presenter, and behind the scenes was annoyed with the changes, particularly the inclusion of a woman as presenter. However, he later retracted this view, having witnessed the progress &quot;Tiswas&quot; had made with James&#x27;s contribution.

One significant change almost never happened. ATV management were displeased with the visual slapstick element - the hurling of custard pies and water. They believed this was setting a bad example to the young viewers. Newly drafted producer/director Glyn Edwards managed to retain this vital, messy element by drawing on his experience as a Punch &amp; Judy puppeteer to create a &#x27;villain&#x27; character called &#x27;The Phantom Flan Flinger&#x27;, who would be the black-clad masked nemesis of the presenting team, and the main instigator of pie-throwing chaos. The &quot;phantom&quot; was later revealed to be Ben Mills, a taxi driver from Cheswick Green near Solihull.

John Gorman made his debut in this series, but with just four appearances, it would not be until series 5 that he became a regular visitor to the &quot;Tiswas&quot; studios. Likewise, child performer Paul Hardin made sporadic appearances.

The programme expanded its footprint further outside its home region. As well as appearing in part on HTV, Anglia, Border, Granada and Scottish Television began to screen &quot;Tiswas&quot; in its entirety. Anglia dropped the series a number of times to pick up other regions&#x27; Saturday morning programmes throughout &quot;Tiswas&quot;″s history.

===Series 5 (1978-1979)===
John Gorman became a regular performer from November onwards. Scottish and Granada dropped the series in 1978 in favour of showing other programmes but began carrying the series again in 1979. HTV continued to opt in and out of the programme during &quot;Ten on Saturday&quot;.

Bob Carolgees made his debut in early 1979, having been told to go on the programme by Irish comic Frank Carson. Carolgees appeared again two weeks later, and Chris was so pleased with his contribution that he decided to make a regular fixture out of Bob.

Lenny Henry made sporadic appearances throughout this series, but was not established as a regular. Child performer Paul Hardin increased his visits to the studios, and could well be considered as a series 5 team member, likewise Sylveste McCoy (who added an &quot;r&quot; to his first name later in his career) who performed surreal comic interludes.

===Series 6 (1979-1980)===
Many ITV regions took the programme for the first time, establishing the show strongly in the nation&#x27;s consciousness. London-based viewers tended to complain to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) about some of the edgier moments the show had.

With an almost national audience, the show became inclusive of its increased viewership by making a bigger role out of specially invited viewer performances. Many of these were children who sang songs or performed dance routines. Chris Tarrant, now producer as well as presenter, found most of these contributions to be of little value, until he came across a unique act by a five-year-old boy, Matthew Butler. Encouraged by his &quot;Tiswas&quot;-obsessed mother, Butler auditioned for the series wearing a rabbit costume and sang the song &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; made famous by the animated film &quot;Watership Down&quot;, although his own singing ability was rather poor. Tarrant found this so amusing that he arranged for him to appear on the following &quot;Tiswas&quot;, as well as many subsequent editions.

Also appearing a number of times in this series was Norman Collier, the Yorkshire comedian best known for his broken microphone routine and chicken impressions.

Another by-product of &quot;Tiswas&quot;″s increased audience was the boost to merchandise sales: an annual book was established, and there was a tour of universities (recognising their adult and teenaged audience) by the &quot;Tiswas&quot; team, under the name of the Four Bucketeers, which tied in with their spin-off album on CBS Records. This was all born out of one feature of the sixth series - &quot;The Bucket of Water Song&quot;, which was such a hit with the viewers that it evolved from an intended one-off to an almost regular part of &quot;Tiswas&quot;.

&quot;Tiswas&quot; had been off air due to the massive strike by ITV technicians which lasted 11 weeks from August to October 1979.

===Series 7 (1980-1981)===
By now, ATV had increased the budget for &quot;Tiswas&quot;, and Chris Tarrant had more of a say in the programme&#x27;s production than ever before. The most remembered theme tune was heard for the first time, and the studio set was based around ATV cartoonist Chris Wroe&#x27;s caricatures of the presenting team.

This series can be considered as the definitive series, due to the material drawn from this era that usually gets an airing on documentaries and clips shows when &quot;Tiswas&quot; is the subject. In addition, the three video compilations that have been released for sale have been packaged around a seventh series theme, with the bulk of the clips also being from this age.

Midway through this series, Chris Tarrant decided to leave upon its conclusion. Bob Carolgees, Lenny Henry and John Gorman also left after the final edition of series 7. (28 March 1981) They had decamped to start work on &quot;O.T.T.&quot;, a late-night version of &quot;Tiswas&quot; intended for an adult audience, which would debut in 1982. The only regular &quot;Tiswas&quot; presenter left was Sally James, who stayed on for series 8.

===Series 8 (1981-1982)===
The last series had its format heavily tinkered with by ATV management. They believed that the adult audience should be avid viewers of Chris&#x27; &#x27;late-night&#x27; &quot;Tiswas&quot;, and therefore &quot;Tiswas&quot; itself should focus on its child audience. It was also the first time Tyne Tees and Ulster started to screen the series.

The new presenting team consisted of Midlands DJ Gordon Astley, former Darts frontman Den Hegarty and comic impressionist Fogwell Flax. Veteran &quot;Tiswas&quot; presenter Sally James stayed on and became the series&#x27; Music Editor, but decided to leave towards the series&#x27; end. This was likely to be a factor in Central Television&#x27;s decision not to bring the programme back for a ninth series.

Semi-regulars were dwarf actor David Rappaport who played characters such as &#x27;Green Nigel&#x27; (in a pastiche of BBC programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot;) and the Fonz-like &#x27;Shades&#x27;, Emil Wolk and puppeteer Trevor James with a giant parrot, presumably to fill the void left by Bob Carolgees.

At the end of 1981, a restructure of ITV&#x27;s broadcast franchises saw ATV win back the franchise for the Midlands on condition of changes in management, regional output and branding. Thus, the first part of the series was produced by ATV and the second part by Central Television.

The decision by TVS, the new ITV station in the south and south-east of England, to drop the Central-produced half of the last series in favour of its own Saturday morning programme &quot;No. 73&quot; saw fans of &quot;Tiswas&quot; picket outside its studios in Southampton. The eighth series was broadcast on TVS upon the conclusion of &quot;No. 73&quot;″s first series.

During its ATV days the chairman of the station, Lew Grade, was said to have taken a personal dislike to the show but was persuaded to let it continue, even arguing in its defence to criticism from the IBA. It was believed that the new management at Central frowned upon the anarchy of &quot;Tiswas&quot; (and the common popularity of another production, the soap opera &quot;Crossroads&quot;) and in a desire to make the station more upmarket than its previous incarnation took the evidence of declining audiences for the new format as justification to axe &quot;Tiswas&quot; after series 8, the final episode of Tiswas was transmitted live on 3 April 1982, ending the entire show with the cast singing &quot;Auld Flang Syne.&quot;

==Transmissions==
===Missing episodes===
Almost every edition of &quot;Tiswas&quot; was transmitted live, and only recorded in case of any future IBA investigation (as was standard practice at the time). Accordingly, they suffered the same fate as a number of 1970s children&#x27;s series, in that they were thought to have no further commercial use (the idea of home video entertainment was still in its infancy), and therefore many master tapes were wiped for re-use. As a result, very few programmes officially exist in their entirety. Those that were kept were often stored in poor conditions, which led to severe picture deterioration, so they are no longer of broadcast quality.

However, some did survive; many viewers made their own recordings and in many cases these are the only existing copies of the programmes. Members of the production team and performers on the show would also record their appearances, leading to many episodes existing in private hands. In 2006, ITV began a search for many missing ITV programmes, including &quot;Tiswas&quot;, for their &quot;Raiders of the Lost Archive&quot; series broadcast in 2007.

Their website reveals that only 22 episodes are known to officially exist in their entirety: episode 60 from 30 August 1975, four episodes from 1978, two episodes from 1979, two episodes from 1980, five episodes from 1981 and nine episodes from 1982. Incomplete segments from show 151 (broadcast on 10 December 1977), an episode from 1978 and two episodes from 1979 are also known to have survived.

The prolific &quot;TiswasOnline&quot; fansite features an in-depth episode guide for the whole series, detailing where an episode is known to exist, whether as a private home recording or in the official archive. ITV plc has confirmed to &quot;TiswasOnline&quot; that many more programme elements (other than those officially known to exist) have been kept, but as yet these have not been fully catalogued. This may include insert material such as animations and graphics or filmed clips. Furthermore, the &quot;Tiswas Reunited&quot; programme in 2007 resulted in the discovery of further footage.

===&quot;O.T.T.&quot;===
On 2 January 1982 Tarrant, Carolgees, Gorman, Randolph Sutherland and Henry launched a late-night show - with the up-and-coming comics Alexei Sayle and Helen Atkinson-Wood called &quot;O.T.T.&quot; (standing for &quot;Over the Top&quot;) which was effectively an &quot;adult&quot; version of &quot;Tiswas&quot; - in other words, it attempted to be just as anarchic, but with swearing and occasional topless women. It was not such a success, running for just one series, and is today chiefly remembered for the naked &#x27;Balloon Dance&#x27; performed by The Greatest Show on Legs, including comedian Malcolm Hardee. The theme tune was recorded by Roy Wood and was released as a single

=== &quot;Saturday Stayback&quot; ===
&quot;Saturday Stayback&quot; was a short-lived (January–February 1983) late night comedy show based in a pub. Although intended as some sort of sequel to &quot;O.T.T.&quot;, this differed quite a lot, for it was all recorded rather than the live chaos of its predecessor. It mainly consisted of comedy sketches, with some live music acts - usually Thin Lizzy and Roy Wood. &quot;Saturday Stayback&quot; received much less controversy than &quot;O.T.T.&quot;, and also introduced new talent such as Phil Cool and Tony Slattery. It lasted only six episodes. Chris Tarrant and Bob Carolgees were the only ex-&quot;Tiswas&quot; personnel regularly seen on screen, and John Gorman helped out on writing duty.

===&quot;Tiswas&quot; Reunion===
A definitive line-up of &quot;Tiswas&quot; presenters regrouped for a resurrection of &quot;Tiswas&quot; on the ITV Telethon of 1988. This took place in LWT&#x27;s South Bank studios in London, culminating in an outside performance of &quot;The Bucket of Water Song&quot;.

===&quot;Ministry of Mayhem&quot;===
In late 2005, ITV&#x27;s Saturday morning show &quot;Ministry of Mayhem&quot; had a special edition featuring presenters from past Saturday morning shows, including &quot;Tiswas&quot;. Representing &quot;Tiswas&quot; was Sally James, although Chris Tarrant did a video link-up for a brief interview during the show. Out of the cult Saturday morning shows that were focused on, &quot;Tiswas&quot; was significantly the most prominent, with many clips shown from it, and even a re-enactment of two &quot;Tiswas&quot; staples - the Cage and the &quot;Pass The Pie&quot; game.

===&quot;Tiswas&quot; on &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot;===
In December 2005, BBC Saturday morning show &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot; featured a thirty-year-old man singing &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; with his friends as part of a talent spot. This person was Matthew Lewis, formerly known as Matthew Butler, who performed his unique rendition of the song back in 1980 on &quot;Tiswas&quot; when he was aged five. Presenters Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood took the opportunity to praise Matthew, as they are fans of &quot;Tiswas&quot;, and also to dispel recent tabloid rumours of Dick and Dom resurrecting &quot;Tiswas&quot; on ITV. However, Wood did present one episode of &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot; wearing a &quot;Tiswas&quot; T-shirt.

===Lenny Henry on &quot;It Started With Swap Shop&quot;===
Lenny Henry appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;It Started With Swap Shop&quot; programme in 2006, in which he spoke to Noel Edmonds about &quot;Tiswas&quot; being the rival of &quot;Swap Shop&quot; during the entire era.

===&quot;Tiswas Reunited – The 2007 Special&quot;===
A new programme to celebrate 25 years since the final Tiswas show was broadcast by ITV1 on 16 June 2007, it started with the traditional ATV logo and jingle. This programme had been delayed from May in order to allow for an extended transmission slot. Celebrities and &#x27;old &quot;Tiswas&quot; mates&#x27; alike joined in the fun. In an interview publicising this, Chris Tarrant put out an appeal to the public to submit any surviving video footage of the series to be included in the new programme - which resulted in the discovery of further footage.

A DVD release of the programme, featuring an extended edition plus a short featurette on the history of &quot;Tiswas&quot;, was released shortly after transmission.

From the official press release:
&quot;For one night only, ITV1 brings you TiSWAS REUNITED, a one-off special reuniting the stars of the iconic groundbreaking children’s show TiSWAS. With a wealth of clips and reminiscences from the many stars who appeared on the series, the team will recreate the chaos and mayhem of those heady days of the show that broke the mould. TiSWAS REUNITED is new and exclusive to ITV1, spring 2007&quot;.
The producers of the programme looked for people who were involved in the original series, whether they were in the audience, appeared as a guest, won a competition (&quot;pulled up by the ears&quot;) or in any other capacity. The TiswasOnline website helped with these searches (and numerous other aspects of the new programme), and people could submit their details directly to the production team and apply to be in the cage.

A new logo for the programme was produced - it features the regular &#x27;zig-zag&#x27; logo (including the Phantom Flan Flinger) with &quot;Reunited&quot; rubber-stamped across it.

The official Tiswas Reunited &#x27;mini-site&#x27; features exclusive material about the making of the programme, as well as blogs by those who took part in the programme itself (guests and residents of the Cage!)

The ITV broadcast referred only briefly to John Asher and Trevor East, the programme&#x27;s original presenters, and omitted to make any reference to the eighth and final series (possibly because it was the one series in which &quot;Reunited&quot;&#x27;s Executive Producer Chris Tarrant was not involved.)

==Merchandise==
&quot;Tiswas&quot; was a pioneer for children&#x27;s television, making its way to shop shelves. Books, T-shirts, a regular magazine, an album, various singles and even a ceramic money box have all been daubed with the &quot;Tiswas&quot; logo.

===Magazine===
A magazine counterpart was produced with interviews with cast, quizzes and letters. This appeared initially as &quot;Tiswas Family Fun Book&quot; at the beginning of 1981 and developed into &quot;Tiswas Magazine&quot; from September 1981 to coincide with the final series.

===Annuals===
Four annual hardcover books were produced in &quot;Tiswas&quot;″s later years. Presenter/performer John Gorman wrote the first three (published in the Autumn of 1979, 1980, 1981), and Ollie Spencer the 1983 edition (prepared in spring 1982 and published that autumn, featuring presenters and characters from the final 1981–82 series).

===Video compilations===
In the early 1990s, three VHS compilations were made available. The majority of &quot;Tiswas&quot; never survived as recordings, but among collectors, some with the earliest domestic VCRs, and some studio copies of later editions.

These compilations were not like ordinary editions of &quot;Tiswas&quot;, in that &#x27;non-original&#x27; content such as music videos, film clips and cartoons were stripped out. Original features like competition spots and pop interviews were also excluded, in favour of highlighting the show&#x27;s legacy to comedy and visual slapstick.

====&quot;Best of the Best Bits&quot;====
The first compilation, lasting about an hour, and purely full of comedy sketches from the series. Some of the most repeated clips from the series have made the grade for this compilation - notably some News Flash sketches with Lenny Henry as &#x27;Trevor McDoughnut&#x27; (including one where the target of the spoof - Trevor McDonald - takes over as a surprise) and the &#x27;viewer&#x27;s letters&#x27; clip where Sally James is pied and drenched in semolina, baked beans and custard. Moving slightly away from comedy, the music video for the Four Bucketeers&#x27; &quot;Bucket of Water Song&quot; is included.

====&quot;More of the Best Bits&quot;====
The second compilation continued in the same vein as the first. Frank Carson being soaked unexpectedly is a running gag, and there is a full rendition of &#x27;Bright Eyes&#x27; from Matthew Butler. A music video for The Four Bucketeers&#x27; Water Is Wonderful ends the compilation.

====&quot;Comedy Capers&quot;====
This was targeted at the stand-up comedy VHS market at the time, and the inlay cover made great mention of comic legends&#x27; appearances, such as Spike Milligan, Michael Palin and Bernard Manning. Content-wise, it is very similar to the previous two compilations, with many sketches being performed by the &quot;Tiswas&quot; team. However, this compilation has no contribution from the Four Bucketeers.

===DVD===
Apart from the &quot;Tiswas Reunited&quot; DVD, released by ITV DVD a week after transmission of the 2007 programme, the only other &quot;Tiswas&quot; DVD available is &quot;The Best of Tiswas&quot;.

Issued in October 2005 by Network DVD, &quot;The Best of Tiswas&quot; was a straight DVD issuing of the three VHS compilations - &quot;Best of the Best Bits&quot;, &quot;More of the Best Bits&quot; and &quot;Comedy Capers&quot;. Being on DVD format, it has better picture quality than the VHS version. However, due to the rarity of some &quot;Tiswas&quot; material (many episodes surviving only on off-air recordings) there is some understandably rough-looking footage here and there. Additionally, the &quot;More of the Best Bits&quot; compilation is entirely sourced from a VHS copy, for the original VHS release&#x27;s master tape could not be located in time for transfer.
