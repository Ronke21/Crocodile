<text>The Snowy Mountains Scheme, also known as the Snowy Hydro or the Snowy scheme, is a hydroelectricity and irrigation complex in south-east Australia. Near the border of New South Wales and Victoria, the scheme consists of sixteen major dams; nine power stations; two pumping stations; and of tunnels, pipelines and aqueducts that were constructed between 1949 and 1974. The Scheme was completed under the supervision of Chief Engineer, Sir William Hudson. It is the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia.

The water of the Snowy River and some of its tributaries, much of which formerly flowed southeast onto the river flats of East Gippsland, and into Bass Strait of the Tasman Sea, is captured at high elevations and diverted inland to the Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers irrigation areas. The Scheme includes two major tunnel systems constructed through the continental divide of the Snowy Mountains, known in Australia as the Great Dividing Range. The water falls and travels through large hydro-electric power stations which generate peak-load power for the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria. The Scheme also provides some security of water flows to the Murray-Darling basin, providing approximately of water a year to the basin for use in Australia&#x27;s irrigated agriculture industry.

In 2016, the Snowy Mountains Scheme was added to the Australian National Heritage List.

==History==


===Background===
Since the 1800s, both the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers have been subject to development and control to meet water supply and irrigation needs. By contrast, the Snowy River, that rises in the Australian Alps and flows through mountainous and practically uninhabited country until debouching onto the river flats of East Gippsland, had never been controlled in any way, neither for the production of power nor for irrigation. A great proportion of its waters flowed eastwards into the South Pacific Ocean (the Tasman Sea). The Snowy River has the highest headwater source of any in Australia and draws away a large proportion of the waters from the south-eastern New South Wales snowfields. The construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme was seen as a means of supplementing the flow of the great inland rivers, a means for developing hydro-electric power, and also a way to increase agricultural production in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys.

Following World War II, the Government of New South Wales proposed that the flow of the Snowy River be diverted into the Murrumbidgee River for irrigation and agricultural purposes. There was little emphasis placed on the generation of power. A counter proposal by the Government of Victoria involved a greater generation of power, and involved diversion of the Snowy River to the Murray River. Additionally, the Government of South Australia was concerned that downstream flows on the Murray River would be severely jeopardised.

The Commonwealth Government, looking at the national implications of the two proposals, initiated a meeting to discuss the use of the waters of the Snowy River, and a Committee was set up in 1946 to examine the question on the broadest possible basis. This Committee, in a report submitted in November 1948, suggested consideration of a far greater scheme than any previously put forward. It involved not only the simple question of use of the waters of the Snowy River, but consideration of the possible diversion of a number of rivers in the area, tributaries, not only of the Snowy, but of the Murray and Murrumbidgee. The recommendations of the Committee were generally agreed to by a conference of Ministers representing the Commonwealth, New South Wales, and Victoria, and it was also agreed that the Committee should continue its investigations.

However, limitations in the Australian Constitution meant that the Commonwealth Government was limited in the powers it could exercise, without the agreement of the States. Subsequently, the Commonwealth Government introduced legislation into the Federal Parliament under its defence power; and enacted the that enabled the formation of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority. Ten years later, the relevant States and Territories introduced their own corresponding legislation and in January 1959 the Snowy Mountains Agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States.

The legislation created the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority that was given responsibility for the final evaluation, design and construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. The final agreed plan was to divert the waters of the Snowy Mountains region to provide increased electricity generating capacity and to provide irrigation water for the dry west. It was &quot;greeted with enthusiasm by the people of Australia&quot; and was seen to be &quot;a milestone towards full national development&quot;.

The chief engineer, New Zealand-born William Hudson (knighted 1955), was chosen to head the scheme as Chairman of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority, and was instructed to seek workers from overseas. Hudson&#x27;s employment of workers from 32 (mostly European) countries, many of whom had been at war with each other only a few years earlier, had a significant effect on the cultural mix of Australia.

=== Construction ===



Construction of the Snowy Scheme was managed by the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority. It officially began on 17 October 1949 and took 25 years, being officially completed in 1974.

An agreement between the United States Bureau of Reclamation and Snowy Mountains Hydro to provide technical assistance and training of engineers was agreed between the United States and Australia in Washington, D.C., on 16 November 1951. A loan for $100 million was obtained from the World Bank in 1962.

Tunneling records were set in the construction of the Scheme and it was completed on time and on budget in 1974, at a cost of 820 million; a dollar value equivalent in 1999 and 2004 to A$6 billion. Around two thirds of the workforce employed in the construction of the scheme were immigrant workers, originating from over thirty countries. The official death toll of workers on the Scheme stands at 121 people. Some of roads and tracks were constructed, seven townships and over 100 camps were built to enable construction of the 16 major dams, seven hydroelectric power stations, two pumping stations, of tunnel and of pipelines and aqueducts. Just 2% of the construction work is visible from above ground.

Two of the towns constructed for the scheme are now permanent; Cabramurra, the highest town in Australia; and Khancoban. Cooma flourished during construction of the Scheme and remains the headquarters of the operating company of the Scheme. Townships at Adaminaby, Jindabyne and Talbingo were inundated by the flooded waters from Lake Eucumbene, Lake Jindabyne and Jounama Reservoir. Improved vehicular access to the high country enabled ski-resort villages to be constructed at Thredbo and Guthega in the 1950s by former Snowy Scheme workers who realised the potential for expansion of the Australian ski industry.

The Scheme is in an area of , almost entirely within the Kosciuszko National Park. The design of the scheme was modelled on that of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Over 100,000 people from over 30 countries were employed during its construction, providing employment for many recently arrived immigrants, and was important in Australia&#x27;s post-war economic and social development. Seventy percent of all the workers were migrants. During construction of the tunnels, a number of railways were employed to convey spoil from worksites and to deliver personnel, concrete and equipment throughout.

The project used Australia&#x27;s first transistorised computer; one of the first in the world. Called &#x27;Snowcom&#x27;, the computer was used from 1960 to 1967.

At the completion of the project, the Australian Government maintained much of the diverse workforce and established the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC), which is now an international engineering consultancy company. The Scheme is the largest renewable energy generator in mainland Australia and plays an important role in the operation of the National Electricity Market, generating approximately 67% of all renewable energy in the mainland National Electricity Market. The Snowy Scheme&#x27;s primary function is as a water manager, however under the corporatised model must deliver dollar dividends to the three shareholder governments - the NSW, Commonwealth and Victorian Governments.

The Scheme also has a significant role in providing security of water flows to the Murray-Darling Basin. The Scheme provides approximately of water a year to the Basin, providing additional water for an irrigated agriculture industry worth about A$3 bn per annum, representing more than 40% of the gross value of the nation&#x27;s agricultural production.

The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme, is one of the most complex integrated water and hydro-electric power schemes in the world and is listed as a &quot;world-class civil engineering project&quot; by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The scheme interlocks seven power stations and 16 major dams through of trans-mountain tunnels and of aqueducts. The history of the Snowy Scheme reveals its important role in building post World War II Australia.

Sir William Hudson was appointed the first commissioner of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority, serving between 1949 and 1967. The Commissioner&#x27;s role was the overall management of the Scheme. He represented the Scheme at the highest levels of government, welcomed international scientists and engineers, encouraged scientific and engineering research, as well as attending many social and civic activities. Sir William&#x27;s management style &#x27;stressed cooperation between management and labour and scientific knowledge (facts) over opinion&#x27;.

The Scheme was completed with the official opening of the Tumut 3 Power Station project by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Paul Hasluck on 21 October 1972.

===Safety===

The Scheme used a number of innovative approaches to many things during its construction. Notably, all vehicles driven on all parts of the scheme were required to be fitted with seatbelts for driver and front seat passenger; and that these seatbelts were required to be used.

On 16 April 1958, an elevator at Tumut 1 underground power station near Cabramurra fell about 400 feet when the cable broke, killing 4 Italian employees of a French construction firm.

The official death toll during construction was 121.

=== Personal stories and memoirs of work on the Snowy Scheme ===
Various stories and memoirs have been written about work on the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Siobhan McHugh&#x27;s social history, &quot;The Snowy: The People Behind the Power&quot; is the most prominent, having been awarded the NSW Premier&#x27;s Literary Award for Non-Fiction and being the source of an ABC radio documentary series (1987) and a Film Australia documentary, &quot;Snowy, A Dream of Growing Up&quot; (1989). Her book is based on about 90 oral histories with former Snowy workers and residents, with original recordings archived as a research collection at the State Library of New South Wales. An updated 70th anniversary edition of her book was published by New South in 2019 and its content showcased by Richard Fidler in an interview with McHugh for his popular ABC podcast, Conversations. Most recently, Snowy Hydro, Woden Community Service, Gen S Stories and PhotoAccess partnered for a Digital Storytelling project to present a diverse collection of stories told from the point of view of seven ex-workers, two lifelong employees and a child of a Snowy worker.

As part of the project, participants created short films about their experience on the Snowy Scheme, each story offering a unique perspective into what life was like building the Scheme between 1949 and 1974. The project&#x27;s artistic director Jenni Savigny assisted participants to make the short films; enabling them to put together the scripts, record voice overs and edit the short films. In an interview with Andrew Brown (The Canberra Times), Savigny said it was important to create a history of the Snowy Hydro using the participant&#x27;s own words, &quot;You just get a personal sense of what it was like to be there, and what it meant to people&#x27;s lives.&quot;

The films premiered 7 June 2018 at the Palace Electric Cinema in New Acton in Canberra and can be viewed on the Woden Community Service YouTube Channel.

=== Current operations ===
The Scheme is operated by Snowy Hydro Limited, an unlisted public company incorporated pursuant to the , owned by the Australian Federal government.

There is currently further work ongoing for the expansion of the snowy scheme under the Snowy scheme 2.0 announced in 2017. Despite government support it has received many criticisms and concerns over the logistical and financial feasibility of the operation.

==Environmental concerns==

The original plan was for 99% of the water of the Snowy River&#x27;s natural flow to be diverted by the Scheme below Lake Jindabyne. Releases from the Scheme were based on the needs of users only and took no account of the ecosystem&#x27;s needs. It soon became clear that there were major environmental problems in the lower reaches of the Snowy river. An extensive public campaign led to the Snowy Water Inquiry being established in January 1998. The Inquiry reported to the New South Wales and Victorian Governments in October of that year, recommending an increase to 15% of natural flows. The two governments were equivocal about this target. Aside from economic considerations, there was a view that the health of the Murray was more important than that of the Snowy and that any extra environmental flows were better used there instead.

In the 1999 Victorian state election, the seat of Gippsland East was won by Craig Ingram, an independent and member of the Snowy River Alliance, based in large part on his campaign to improve Snowy flows. In 2000, Victoria and NSW agreed to a long-term target of 28%, requiring A$156 million of investment to offset losses to inland irrigators. In August 2002 flows were increased to 6%, with a target of 21% within 10 years. However, by October 2008 it was evident that the return of environmental flows to the Snowy River in 2009 would be no more than 4% of natural flow with governments arguing the Snowy River needs to &quot;pay back&quot; the &quot;Mowamba Borrowings&quot;. At the 2010 state election, Ingram lost the seat of Gippsland East to the Nationals.

In 2017, it was announced that the 21% target would be reached for the first time.

Some concerned water managers, conservationists, politicians and farmers continue to advocate for the return of environmental flows to the Snowy River. The Snowy River Alliance formed in 1996 to address the lack of environmental flow commemorates Snowy River Day annually, towards the end of August, to mark the 2002 anniversary of when the governments of Victoria, NSW and the Commonwealth first released water into the Snowy River over the Mowamba Weir.
The Dalgety District and Community Association started in response to dirty drinking water for the town of Dalgety, the loss of fishing and looming closure of the caravan park. A weir was constructed at Dalgety and the caravan park stayed as a result of their efforts.
In accordance with the Snowy Water Licence, Snowy Hydro Limited has &#x27;re-commissioned&#x27; the Mowamba Aqueduct. Seasonal variable flows are essential to river ecology including flushing flows to support vital ecosystems for the Australian platypus and native Australian Bass, the species over which Ingram initially fought for flows into the Snowy River. A major spillway upgrade now facilitates these flows.

==Components==
Construction of the Scheme began in 1949 and was completed in 1974. Guthega power station commenced power production on 21 February 1955.

===Power stations===
The total installed capacity is .

=== Major dams and reservoirs ===
The Scheme&#x27;s largest dam is Talbingo Dam with an embankment volume of 14 488 000 m3 and a wall height of 161.5 metres. Khancoban Dam is the longest dam in the scheme with a crest length of . A variety of dam and spillway types were used in the construction.

With a capacity of , Lake Eucumbene is the largest reservoir in the Scheme. At the other end of the scale, Deep Creek Reservoir is the smallest reservoir with just .

=== Tunnels ===
=== Pumping Stations ===
The Snowy Mountains Scheme has two pumping stations. The 600 MW pump storage facility at Tumut 3 Power Station returns water to Talbingo Reservoir. The 1 MW Jindabyne Pumping Station pumps water from Lake Jindabyne through to the Snowy-Geehi Tunnel at Island Bend.

==== Expansion plans ====
In March 2017, the Australian government then headed by Malcolm Turnbull suggested a $2 billion project expanding the 4.1 GW Snowy Mountains Scheme by 2 GW of pump storage for a week, building new tunnels and power stations, but no new dams. The 80% efficiency of such storage can be sufficient in leveling differences between supply and demand. Dubbed Snowy 2.0, the expansion has been under construction since 2019 and was expected to be complete by 2026. Delays have meant the project will not be fully operational until 2029.

==Tourism==
The Snowy Scheme is a major tourist destination. Sightseeing driving tours to the key locations of the Scheme are popular out of regional centres like Cooma, Adaminaby and Jindabyne along roads built for the Scheme like the Snowy Mountains Highway and Alpine Way and towards sights like Cabramurra, as Australia&#x27;s highest town, spectacular dam walls, and scenic lakes. Trout fishing is popular in the lakes of the Scheme, notably Lake Jindabyne and Lake Eucumbene.

The Snowy Scheme Museum opened at Adaminaby in 2011 to profile the history of the Scheme.

Though skiing in Australia began in the northern Snowy Mountains in the 1860s, it was the construction of the vast Snowy Scheme from 1949, with its improvements to infrastructure and influx of experienced European skiers among the workers on the Scheme, that really opened up the mountains for the large scale development of a ski industry, and led to the establishment of Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts. The construction of Guthega Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957. Charles Anton, a snowy worker identified the potential of the Thredbo Valley.

<text>Great Zimbabwe was a city in the south-eastern hills of the modern country of Zimbabwe, near Masvingo. It was settled from 1000 AD, and served as the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe from the 13th century. It is the largest stone structure in precolonial Southern Africa. Major construction on the city began in the 11th century until the 15th century, and it was abandoned in the 16th or 17th century. The edifices were erected by ancestors of the Shona people, currently located in Zimbabwe and nearby countries. The stone city spans an area of and could have housed up to 18,000 people at its peak, giving it a population density of approximately . The Zimbabwe state centred on it likely covered 50,000 km² (19,000 sq mi). It is recognised as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

The site of Great Zimbabwe is composed of the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex, and the Great Enclosure (constructed at different times), and contained area for commoner housing within the perimeter walls. There is disagreement on the functions of the complexes among scholars. Some consider them to have been residences for the royals and elites at different periods of the site, while others infer them to have had separate functions. The Great Enclosure, with its 11m (36 ft) high dry stone walls (that is, constructed without mortar), was built during the 13th and 14th centuries, and likely served as the royal residence, with demarcated public spaces for rituals.

The earliest document mentioning the Great Zimbabwe ruins was in 1531 by Vicente Pegado, captain of the Portuguese garrison of Sofala on the coast of modern-day Mozambique, who recorded it as &quot;Symbaoe&quot;. The first confirmed visits by Europeans were in the late 19th century, with investigations of the site starting in 1871. Great Zimbabwe and surrounding sites were looted by European antiquarians between the 1890s and 1920s. Some later studies of the monument were controversial, as the white government of Rhodesia pressured archaeologists to deny its construction by black Africans. Its African origin only became consensus by the 1950s. Great Zimbabwe has since been adopted as a national monument by the Zimbabwean government, and the modern independent state was named after it.

The word &quot;great&quot; distinguishes the site from the many smaller ruins, known as &quot;zimbabwes&quot;, spread across the Zimbabwe Highveld. There are around 200 such sites in Southern Africa, such as Bumbusi in Zimbabwe and Manyikeni in Mozambique, with monumental, mortarless walls.

==Name==

&quot;Zimbabwe&quot; is the Shona name of the ruins, first recorded in 1531 by Vicente Pegado, captain of the Portuguese garrison of Sofala. Pegado noted that &quot;The natives of the country call these edifices &quot;Symbaoe&quot;, which according to their language signifies &#x27;court.

The name contains , the Shona term for &#x27;houses&#x27;. There are two theories for the etymology of the name. The first proposes that the word is derived from , translated from Shona as &#x27;large houses of stone&#x27; ( = plural of , &#x27;house&#x27;; = plural of , &#x27;stone&#x27;). A second suggests that &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; is a contracted form of , which means &#x27;venerated houses&#x27; in the Zezuru dialect of Shona, as usually applied to the houses or graves of chiefs.

==History and description==

===Settlement===
The Great Zimbabwe area was previously settled by the San dating back 100,000 years, and by Bantu-speaking peoples from 150 BC who formed agricultural chiefdoms from the 4th century AD. Between the 4th and the 7th centuries, communities of the Gokomere or Ziwa cultures farmed the valley, and mined and worked iron, but built no stone structures. These are the earliest Iron Age settlements in the area identified from archaeological diggings, and the later Gumanye people are considered the ancestors of the Karanga (south-central Shona), who would construct Great Zimbabwe.

===Construction and growth===
Construction of the stone buildings started in the 11th century and continued for over 300 years. The ruins at Great Zimbabwe are some of the oldest and largest structures located in Southern Africa. Its most formidable edifice, commonly referred to as the Great Enclosure, has walls as high as extending approximately . Its growth has been linked to the decline of Mapungubwe from around 1300, or the greater availability of gold in the hinterland of Great Zimbabwe.
Traditional estimates are that Great Zimbabwe had as many as 18,000 inhabitants at its peak. However, a more recent survey concluded that the population likely never exceeded 10,000. The ruins that survive are built entirely of stone; they span . Great Zimbabwe covered a similar area to medieval London; while the density of buildings within the stone enclosures was high, in areas outside them it was much lower. The institutionalisation of Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s politico-religious ideology served to legitimise the position of the king (&quot;mambo&quot;), with a link between leaders, their ancestors, and God. Ken Mufuka writes that the shrine in the Hill Complex was the home of spirit mediums (&quot;svikiro&quot;) who were tasked with acting as the conscience of the state, and preserving the traditions of the founders, reported to be Chigwagu Rusvingo (the first &quot;mambo&quot;), Chaminuka, Chimurenga, Tovera, and Soro-rezhou among others.

The majority of the population lived in houses made out of mud on wooden frame structures, however the number of these can only be estimated. It is equally assumed that the stone structures were royal or official buildings, and elite dwellings. No burials have been found at the site to give another basis for estimating population.

===Features of the ruins===
In 1531, Vicente Pegado, Captain of the Portuguese Garrison of Sofala, described Zimbabwe thus:
The ruins form three distinct architectural groups. They are known as the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex and the Great Enclosure. The Hill Complex is the oldest, and was occupied from the 11th to 13th centuries. The Great Enclosure was occupied from the 13th to 15th centuries, and the Valley Complex from the 14th to 16th centuries. Notable features of the Hill Complex include the Eastern Enclosure, in which it is thought the Zimbabwe Birds stood, a high balcony enclosure overlooking the Eastern Enclosure, and a huge boulder in a shape similar to that of the Zimbabwe Bird. The Great Enclosure is composed of an inner wall, encircling a series of structures and a younger outer wall. The Conical Tower, in diameter and high, was constructed between the two walls. The Valley Complex is divided into the Upper and Lower Valley Ruins, with different periods of occupation.
There are different archaeological interpretations of these groupings. It has been suggested that the complexes represent the work of successive kings: some of the new rulers founded a new residence. The focus of power moved from the Hill Complex in the 12th century, to the Great Enclosure, the Upper Valley and finally the Lower Valley in the early 16th century. The alternative &quot;structuralist&quot; interpretation holds that the different complexes had different functions: the Hill Complex as an area for rituals, perhaps related to rain making, the Valley complex was for the citizens, and the Great Enclosure was used by the king. Structures that were more elaborate were probably built for the kings, although it has been argued that the dating of finds in the complexes does not support this interpretation.

Dhaka pits were closed depressions utilized by inhabitants of Great Zimbabwe as sources of water management in the form of reservoirs, wells and springs. Dhaka pits may have been in use since the mid-2nd millennium CE and the system could hold more than 18,000 m3 of water storage.

===Notable artefacts===
The most important artefacts recovered from the Monument are the eight Zimbabwe Birds. These were carved from a micaceous schist (soapstone) on the tops of monoliths the height of a person. Slots in a platform in the Eastern Enclosure of the Hill Complex appear designed to hold the monoliths with the Zimbabwe birds, but as they were not found in situ, the original location of each monolith and bird within the enclosure cannot be determined . Other artefacts include soapstone figurines (one of which is in the British Museum), pottery, iron gongs, elaborately worked ivory, iron and copper wire, iron hoes, bronze spearheads, copper ingots and crucibles, and gold beads, bracelets, pendants and sheaths. Glass beads and porcelain from China and Persia among other foreign artefacts were also found, attesting the international trade linkages of the Kingdom. In the extensive stone ruins of the great city, which still remain today, include eight, monolithic birds carved in soapstone. It is thought that they represent the bateleur eagle – a good omen, protective spirit and messenger of the gods in Shona culture.

===Trade===
Great Zimbabwe became a centre for trading, having replaced Mapungubwe around 1300. Regional networks were expansive, and salt, cattle, grain, and copper were traded as far north as the Kundelungu Plateau in present-day DR Congo. A significant portion of Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s wealth came from the domination of trade routes from the goldfields of the Zimbabwean Plateau to the Swahili coast. Through Swahili city-states such as Sofala, they exported gold and ivory into the Indian Ocean trade. That international commerce was in addition to the local agricultural trade, in which cattle were especially important. The large cattle herd that supplied the city moved seasonally and was managed by the court. Chinese pottery shards, coins from Arabia, glass beads and other non-local items have been excavated at Zimbabwe. Despite these strong international trade links, there is no evidence to suggest exchange of architectural concepts between Great Zimbabwe and centres such as Kilwa. 

===Decline===
It is unknown what caused Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s demise and its eventual abandonment. It is unclear to what extent climate change played a role, however Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s location in a favourable rainfall zone makes this unlikely to have been a primary cause. Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s dominance over the region depended on its continual extension and projection of influence, as its growing population needed more farming land and traders more gold. Shona oral tradition attributes Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s demise to a salt shortage, which may be a figurative way of speaking of land depletion for agriculturalists or of the depletion of critical resources for the community. It is plausible the aquifer Great Zimbabwe sat on top of ran out of water, or the growing population contaminated the water.

From the early 15th century, international trade began to decline amid a global economic downturn, reducing demand for gold, which adversely affected Great Zimbabwe. In response to this, elites expanded regional trading networks, resulting in greater prosperity for other settlements in the region. By the late 15th century, the consequences of this decision began to manifest, as offshoots from Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s royal family formed new dynasties, possibly as a result of losing succession disputes. According to oral tradition, Nyatsimba Mutota, a member of Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s royal family, led part of the population north in search for salt to found the Mutapa Empire. It was believed that only their most recent ancestors would follow them, with older ancestors staying at Great Zimbabwe and providing protection there. Angoche traders opened a new route along the Zambezi via Mutapa and Ingombe Ilede to reach the goldfields west of Great Zimbabwe, precipitating its decline and the rise of Khami, the capital of the Kingdom of Butua. By the 16th century, political and economic power had shifted away from Great Zimbabwe to the north and west. The site likely continued to be inhabited into the 17th century, before it was eventually abandoned.

==History of research and origins of the ruins==
There has historically been much debate around the origins of Great Zimbabwe, termed the &quot;Zimbabwe controversy&quot;. Mired in racial prejudice, Rhodesians found it inconceivable that the structures could have been built be indigenous Africans, stipulating that archaeological discoveries of Persian bowls and Chinese celadon were the result of pre-Bantu settlement. The colonial government pressured archaeologists to deny that the structure was built by indigenous Africans, because acknowledging it would have dismantled their &quot;civilising mission&quot; rationale. The refutation of various fantastical and dehumanising theories ascribing the construction to Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, and anyone but the Shona, along with other activities of the antiquarians, dominated the historiography of Great Zimbabwe throughout the 20th century. Its African origin only became consensus by the 1950s. 

===From Portuguese traders to Karl Mauch===
The first European visit may have been made by the Portuguese traveler António Fernandes in 1513–1515, who crossed twice and reported in detail the region of present-day Zimbabwe (including the Shona kingdoms) and also fortified centers in stone without mortar. However, passing en route a few kilometres north and about south of the site, he did not make a reference to Great Zimbabwe. Portuguese traders heard about the remains of the medieval city in the early 16th century, and records survive of interviews and notes made by some of them, linking Great Zimbabwe to gold production and long-distance trade. Two of those accounts mention an inscription above the entrance to Great Zimbabwe, written in characters not known to the Arab merchants who had seen it.

In 1506, the explorer Diogo de Alcáçova described the edifices in a letter to Manuel I of Portugal, writing that they were part of the larger kingdom of Ucalanga (presumably Karanga, a dialect of the Shona people spoken mainly in Masvingo and Midlands provinces of Zimbabwe). João de Barros left another such description of Great Zimbabwe in 1538, as recounted to him by Moorish traders who had visited the area and possessed knowledge of the hinterland. He indicates that the edifices were locally known as &quot;Symbaoe&quot;, which meant &quot;royal court&quot; in the vernacular. As to the actual identity of the builders of Great Zimbabwe, de Barros writes:
Additionally, with regard to the purpose of the Great Zimbabwe ruins, de Barros asserted that: &quot;in the opinion of the Moors who saw it [Great Zimbabwe] it is very ancient and was built to keep possessions of the mines, which are very old, and no gold has been extracted from them for years, because of the wars ... it would seem that some prince who has possession of these mines ordered it to be built as a sign thereof, which he afterwards lost in the course of time and through their being so remote from his kingdom&quot;.

De Barros further remarked that &quot;Symbaoe&quot; &quot;is guarded by a nobleman, who has charge of it, after the manner of a chief alcaide, and they call this officer Symbacayo ... and there are always some of Benomotapa&#x27;s wives therein of whom Symbacayo takes care.&quot; Thus, Great Zimbabwe appears to have still been inhabited as recently as the early 16th century.

===Karl Mauch and the Queen of Sheba===
The ruins were rediscovered by Europeans during a hunting trip in 1867 by Adam Render, a German-American hunter, prospector and trader in southern Africa, who in 1871 showed the ruins to Karl Mauch, a German explorer and geographer of Africa. Karl Mauch recorded the ruins and immediately speculated about a possible Biblical association with King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, an explanation which had been suggested by earlier writers such as the Portuguese João dos Santos. Mauch went so far as to favour a legend that the structures were built to replicate the palace of the Queen of Sheba in Jerusalem, and claimed a wooden lintel at the site must be Lebanese cedar, brought by Phoenicians. The Sheba legend, as promoted by Mauch, became so pervasive in the white settler community as to cause the later scholar James Theodore Bent to say, 

===Carl Peters and Theodore Bent===

Carl Peters collected a ceramic ushabti in 1905. Flinders Petrie examined it and identified a cartouche on its chest as belonging to the 18th Dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III and suggested that it was a statuette of the king and cited it as proof of commercial ties between rulers in the area and the ancient Egyptians during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC), if not a relic of an old Egyptian station near the local gold mines. Johann Heinrich Schäfer later appraised the statuette, and argued that it belonged to a well-known group of forgeries. After having received the ushabti, Felix von Luschan suggested that it was of more recent origin than the New Kingdom. He asserted that the figurine instead appeared to date to the subsequent Ptolemaic era (c. 323–30 BC), when Alexandria-based Greek merchants would export Egyptian antiquities and pseudo-antiquities to southern Africa.

J. Theodore Bent undertook a season at Zimbabwe with Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s patronage and funding from the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. This, and other excavations undertaken for Rhodes, resulted in a book publication that introduced the ruins to English readers. Bent had no formal archaeological training, but had travelled very widely in Arabia, Greece and Asia Minor. He was aided by the expert cartographer and surveyor Robert M. W. Swan (1858–1904), who also visited and surveyed a host of related stone ruins nearby. Bent stated in the first edition of his book &quot;The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland&quot; (1892) that the ruins revealed either the Phoenicians or the Arabs as builders, and he favoured the possibility of great antiquity for the fortress. By the third edition of his book (1902) he was more specific, with his primary theory being &quot;a Semitic race and of Arabian origin&quot; of &quot;strongly commercial&quot; traders living within a client African city.

===The Lemba===

The construction of Great Zimbabwe is also claimed by the Lemba, as documented by William Bolts in 1777 (to the Austrian Habsburg authorities), and by an A.A. Anderson (writing about his travels north of the Limpopo River in the 19th century). Lemba speak the Bantu languages spoken by their geographic neighbours, but they have some religious practices and beliefs similar to those in Judaism and Islam, which they claim were transmitted by oral tradition.

===David Randall-MacIver and medieval origin===
The first scientific archaeological excavations at the site were undertaken by David Randall-MacIver for the British Association in 1905–1906. In &quot;Medieval Rhodesia&quot;, he rejected the claims made by Adam Render, Carl Peters and Karl Mauch, and instead wrote of the existence in the site of objects that were of Bantu origin. Randall-MacIver concluded that all available evidence led him to believe that the Zimbabwe structures were constructed by the ancestors of the Shona people. More importantly he suggested a wholly medieval date for the walled fortifications and temple. This claim was not immediately accepted, partly due to the relatively short and undermanned period of excavation he was able to undertake.

===Gertrude Caton Thompson===

In mid-1929 Gertrude Caton Thompson concluded, after a twelve-day visit of a three-person team and the digging of several trenches, that the site was indeed created by Bantu. She had first sunk three test pits into what had been refuse heaps on the upper terraces of the hill complex, producing a mix of unremarkable pottery and ironwork. She then moved to the Conical Tower and tried to dig under the tower, arguing that the ground there would be undisturbed, but nothing was revealed. Some further test trenches were then put down outside the lower Great Enclosure and in the Valley Ruins, which unearthed domestic ironwork, glass beads, and a gold bracelet. Caton Thompson immediately announced her Bantu origin theory to a meeting of the British Association in Johannesburg. Caton Thompson&#x27;s claim was not immediately favoured, although it had strong support among some scientific archaeologists due to her modern methods. Her most important contribution was in helping to confirm the theory of a medieval origin for the masonry work of the 14th and 15th centuries. By 1931, she had modified her Bantu theory somewhat, allowing for a possible Arabian influence for the towers through the imitation of buildings or art seen at coastal Arabian trading cities.

===Post-1945 research===

Since the 1950s, there has been consensus among archaeologists as to the African origins of Great Zimbabwe. Artefacts and radiocarbon dating indicate settlement in at least the 5th century, with continuous settlement of Great Zimbabwe between the 12th and 15th centuries and the bulk of the finds from the 15th century. The radiocarbon evidence is a suite of 28 measurements, for which all but the first four, from the early days of the use of that method and now viewed as inaccurate, support the 12th-to-15th-centuries chronology. In the 1970s, a beam that produced some of the anomalous dates in 1952 was reanalysed and gave a 14th-century date. Dated finds such as Chinese, Persian and Syrian artefacts also support the 12th- and 15th-century dates.

===Gokomere===
Archaeologists generally agree that the builders spoke one of the Shona languages, based upon evidence of pottery, oral traditions and anthropology and DNA evidence and recent scholarship supports the construction of Great Zimbabwe (and the origin of its culture) by Shona and Venda peoples, who were probably descended from the Gokomere culture. The Gokomere culture, an eastern Bantu subgroup, existed in the area from around 200 AD and flourished from 500 AD to about 800 AD. Archaeological evidence indicates that it constitutes an early phase of the Great Zimbabwe culture. The Gokomere culture likely gave rise to both the modern Mashona people, an ethnic cluster comprising distinct sub-ethnic groups such as the local Karanga clan and the Rozwi culture, which originated as several Shona states. Gokomere peoples were probably also related to certain nearby early Bantu groups like the Mapungubwe civilisation of neighbouring North eastern South Africa, which is believed to have been an early Venda-speaking culture, and to the nearby Sotho.
===Recent research===

More recent archaeological work has been carried out by Peter Garlake, who has produced the comprehensive descriptions of the site, David Beach and Thomas Huffman, who have worked on the chronology and development of Great Zimbabwe and Gilbert Pwiti, who has published extensively on trade links. Today, the most recent consensus attributes the construction of Great Zimbabwe to the Shona people (a Bantu group). Some evidence also suggests an early influence from the probably Venda-speaking peoples of the Mapungubwe civilization.

===Damage to the ruins===

Damage to the ruins has taken place throughout the last century. European antiquarians looted and pillaged Great Zimbabwe and similar structures from the 1890s to 1920s, greatly inhibiting the work of future archaeologists by destroying its stratigraphy. The removal of gold and artefacts in amateurist diggings by early colonial antiquarians caused widespread damage, notably diggings by Richard Nicklin Hall. More extensive damage was caused by the mining of some of the ruins for gold. Reconstruction attempts since 1980 caused further damage, leading to alienation of the local communities from the site. Another source of damage to the ruins has been due to the site being open to visitors with many cases of people climbing the walls, walking over archaeological deposits, and the over-use of certain paths all have had major impacts on the structures at the site. These are in conjunction with damages due to the natural weathering that occurs over time due to vegetation growth, the foundations settling, and erosion from the weather.

==Political implications==

Martin Hall writes that the history of Iron Age research south of the Zambezi shows the prevalent influence of colonial ideologies, both in the earliest speculations about the nature of the African past and in the adaptations that have been made to contemporary archaeological methodologies. Preben Kaarsholm writes that both colonial and black nationalist groups invoked Great Zimbabwe&#x27;s past to support their vision of the country&#x27;s present, through the media of popular history and of fiction. Examples of such popular history include Alexander Wilmot&#x27;s &quot;Monomotapa (Rhodesia)&quot; and Ken Mufuka&#x27;s &quot;Dzimbahwe: Life and Politics in the Golden Age&quot;; examples from fiction include Wilbur Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Sunbird&quot; and Stanlake Samkange&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Uprising&quot;.

When white colonialists like Cecil Rhodes first saw the ruins, they saw them as a sign of the great riches that the area would yield to its new masters. Pikirayi and Kaarsholm suggest that this presentation of Great Zimbabwe was partly intended to encourage settlement and investment in the area. Gertrude Caton-Thompson recognised that the builders were indigenous Africans, but she characterised the site as the &quot;product of an infantile mind&quot; built by a subjugated society. The official line in Rhodesia during the 1960s and 1970s was that the structures were built by non-blacks. Archaeologists who disputed the official statement were censored by the government. According to Paul Sinclair, interviewed for &quot;None But Ourselves&quot;:
This suppression of archaeology culminated in the departure from the country of prominent archaeologists of Great Zimbabwe, including Peter Garlake, Senior Inspector of Monuments for Rhodesia, and Roger Summers of the National Museum.

To black nationalist groups, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol of achievement by Africans: reclaiming its history was a major aim for those seeking majority rule. In 1980 the new internationally recognised independent country was renamed for the site, and its famous soapstone bird carvings were retained from the Rhodesian flag and Coat of Arms as a national symbol and depicted in the new Zimbabwean flag. After the creation of the modern state of Zimbabwe in 1980, Great Zimbabwe has been employed to mirror and legitimise shifting policies of the ruling regime. At first it was argued that it represented a form of pre-colonial &quot;African socialism&quot; and later the focus shifted to stressing the natural evolution of an accumulation of wealth and power within a ruling elite. An example of the former is Ken Mufuka&#x27;s booklet, although the work has been heavily criticised. A tower of the Great Zimbabwe is also depicted on the coat of arms of Zimbabwe.

Some of the carvings had been taken from Great Zimbabwe around 1890 and sold to Cecil Rhodes, who was intrigued and had copies made which he gave to friends. Most of the carvings have now been returned to Zimbabwe, but one remains at Rhodes&#x27; old home, Groote Schuur, in Cape Town.

==Local perspectives==
Local narratives, despite each clan claiming the site of Great Zimbabwe, are very similar in lamenting both the European antiquarians and the professional archaeologists for desecrating and appropriating a sacred site. They hold the government responsible for the &quot;silence&quot; and &quot;closure&quot; of Great Zimbabwe due to their refusal to &quot;acknowledge the ownership and control of the site by the ancestors and Mwari&quot;.

==The Great Zimbabwe University==

In the early 21st century, the government of Zimbabwe endorsed the creation of a university in the vicinity of the ruins. This university is an arts and culture based university which draws from the rich history of the monuments. The university main site is near the monuments with other campuses in the City centre and Mashava. The campuses include Herbet Chitepo Law School, Robert Mugabe School of Education, Gary Magadzire School of Agriculture and Natural Science, Simon Muzenda School of Arts, and Munhumutapa School of Commerce.

<text>America&#x27;s Army is a series of first-person shooter video games developed and published by the U.S. Army, intended to inform, educate, and recruit prospective soldiers. Launched in 2002, the game was branded as a strategic communication device designed to allow Americans to virtually explore the Army at their own pace, and allowed them to determine whether becoming a soldier fits their interests and abilities. &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; represents the first large-scale use of game technology by the U.S. government as a platform for strategic communication and recruitment, and the first use of game technology in support of U.S. Army recruiting.

The Windows version 1.0, subtitled &quot;Recon&quot;, was the first released version on July 4, 2002. As of January 2014 there had been over 41 versions and updates released including updates to &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot;, which was released in August 2013. All versions have been developed on the Unreal Engine. The game was financed by the U.S. government and distributed by free download. &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; has also been used to deliver virtual military experiences to participants at air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country.

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; had been expanded to include versions for Xbox, arcade, and mobile applications published through licensing arrangements.

In May 2022, official online functionality and support for the latest game in the series, &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot;, was withdrawn.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; is a multiplayer video game that enables players to act as soldiers in the U.S. Army in a round-based team tactical shooter with combat at squad-level and three fireteams. GameSpot admired the game&#x27;s authenticity: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty realistic—you take one or two shots and you go limp, you take one more and you&#x27;re done.&quot; Another game review described &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; as &quot;the most realistic portrayal of weapons and combat of any game&quot;.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; ===
&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; promotes adherence to the U.S. Army&#x27;s seven core values. To this extent, the game&#x27;s main ranking system, &quot;Honor&quot;, is named after one.

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; includes optional medical training designed to provide real-world information. In order to assume the role of combat lifesaver in the game, players must pass a virtual medical training course based on actual training that soldiers receive with regard to evaluating and prioritizing casualties, controlling bleeding, recognizing and treating shock, and administering aid when victims are not breathing. Two &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; players have reported using the training they received in-game to save lives in emergency situations; one such account, by Paxton Galvanek, received national media attention.

The game also allows players to train to drive the HMMWV and qualify to use the CROWS system allowing in-game use of the Mk 19 grenade launcher and Browning M2. Training is also available for the Javelin missile as well as specialist training such as parachute training, which allows access to the Airborne missions, and Special Forces training which allows access to the Special Forces missions.

The round ends when one team completes the objective or eliminates the entire opposing team. In certain circumstances, such as when both teams are eliminated or both sides have not completed their objectives when time runs out, there will be a tie.

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; achieves a high realism level in terms of visual and acoustic representation of combat, firearm usage, and mechanics, but its critics have alleged that it fails to convey wartime conditions as accurately as it claims. &quot;If you are going to join the Army, you know the risk&quot;, says player Bart Koscinski. &quot;In this game, you might die eight times in 15 minutes. In real life, people know what they are getting themselves into.&quot;

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; ===
&quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; is a first-person shooter video game, the sequel to &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;. In comparison to its previous versions, &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; was completely remade using Unreal Engine 3 and introduced a number of changes. Medical training is now compulsory, allowing all players to give basic IFAK treatment. While the original &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; required the completion of training to play online, &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; allows one to jump into a game with limited capability, and training is required to unlock desired equipment and skills. Another feature is melee combat in battle using a rifle butt, allowing for stealthier close combat situations. &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; also removed jumping to eliminate the practice of unrealistic bunny hopping-type evasive maneuvers. Players can climb onto or hurdle over low obstacles. &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; reorganizes the fire teams that players were grouped into; the Designated Marksman was made a member of one of the fire teams instead of being a separate two-man shooter/spotter element as would be more fitting of a sniper team.

In June 2011, the U.S. Army released an update to &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot;, which includes two new multiplayer maps, Shantytown and Stronghold, and a number of features including gameplay for &quot;Every Soldier a Sensor&quot;. The ES2 gameplay in &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; brought awareness of the importance of every soldier being observant on every mission. During &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; gameplay, players are rewarded for observing and reporting back things that they came across during the mission that were suspicious or out of place. In December 2011, &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; introduced a new inventory item, the M106 Fast Obscurant Grenade (FOG), into gameplay. The release also provided a new game loader front end to easily create player accounts, view news, manuals, Personnel Jacket and player stats, launch a game server, and a link to the &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; website.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; ===
&quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; is a first-person shooter video game, created using Unreal Engine 3. &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; was released in open beta on August 29, 2013. The game brings back many features from previous &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; games and stresses small unit tactical maneuvers and training to reflect the current day U.S. Army. As with previous versions, &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; was designed with certain principles and ideals in mind including Army values, the Soldier&#x27;s Creed, teamwork, training, and completing the objective. Gameplay scenarios include Battle Drill Exercises and Forward Line Operations. Battle Drill Exercises (BDX) is fast-paced and meant for small engagements of 6 vs. 6 players. BDX maps focus on the basic movements and maneuvers, allowing players to quickly learn how opposing forces play and adjust their strategy for future engagements. Forward Line Operations (FLO) are larger 12 vs. 12 mission-based exercises allowing players to use the skills learned in their Battle Drills to achieve success.

In &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot;, players can use weapons new to the series such as the Remington 870 MCS shotgun and M14 EBR-RI Designated Marksman Rifle, in addition to weapons like the M9 pistol, M4/M4A1 and the M249 light machine gun which had been in previous &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; games. Gameplay features include situational awareness for spotting enemies, effects of weapon suppression, a supported fire system for steadying or resting weapons to help with aim, self-aid where players can stabilize themselves, the revival of incapacitated teammates, securing the enemy, and a more advanced hardcore mode. The game also features updated versions of the hospital and bridge.

Set in the fictional Republic of the Ostregals, players assume the role of an 11B Infantryman practicing combat maneuvers at Joint Training Center Griffin (aka The Proving Grounds) as well as a MOUT (Military Operations in Urban Terrain) training environment quickly assembled using existing building infrastructure, Conex shipping containers, and local materials. This training is crucial to the player&#x27;s success as part of the Long Range Combined Arms–Recon (LRCA-R) team, a full spectrum capable unit for doing special operations missions deep behind enemy lines.

== Development and release ==
=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; ===
&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;&#x27;s concept was conceived in 1999 by Colonel Casey Wardynski, the Army&#x27;s chief economist and a professor at the United States Military Academy. Wardynski envisioned &quot;using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining&quot;. &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; was managed by two other U.S. Army officers serving with Wardynski at the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA): Major Chris Chambers and Major Brett Wilson. Wardynski approached Michael Zyda and Michael Capps at the Naval Postgraduate School&#x27;s (NPS) MOVES Institute in Monterey, California, to make this video game vision a reality. Zyda and Capps took a unique approach for developing a major software project in the United States Department of Defense by assembling a team of professional game developers with experience developing major titles and creating a development studio on the campus of NPS. The project had a development budget of $5 million.

The game was developed by Wardynski who recognized that a video game might be helpful to the U.S. Army in the strategic communication efforts by providing more information to prospective soldiers and to help reduce the number of recruits who wash out during the nine weeks of basic training. The effort proved successful as more than 13 million players have registered &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; accounts over the years, with more than 260 million hours played on the various titles. One teenager was quoted saying the game &quot;provides great information. This would probably spark an interest. I don&#x27;t know how I would have found out so much some other way.&quot;

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; developers licensed commercial game engine technology, specifically the Unreal game engine, as the foundation for its game. It was the first game to feature Unreal Engine 2. &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; is intended to give a positive impression of the U.S. Army. In the official Frequently Asked Questions page the developers confirmed in a statement that one of the reasons people outside the United States can play the game is &quot;We want the whole world to know how great the U.S. Army is.&quot;

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; is the first well-known overt use of computer games for political aims. Chris Chambers, the former deputy director of development for &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;, admits it is a recruitment tool, and Chris Morris of CNN/Money states that &quot;the Army readily admits [America&#x27;s Army] is a propaganda device&quot;. The game aims to become part of youth culture&#x27;s consideration set as confirmed by Army Deputy Chief of Personnel Timothy Maude in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; and its official web page contain links to the &quot;Go Army&quot; recruitment website, another recruiting tool that, according to the Army Subcommittee Testimony from February 2000, has a higher chance of recruiting than &quot;any other method of contact&quot;. Guiding American players to the website is a major goal of the game and it was confirmed that twenty-eight percent of all visitors of &quot;America&#x27;s Army&#x27;s&quot; web page click through to this recruitment site. According to Colonel Wardynski, the game generated interest from other U.S. government agencies, including the Secret Service, resulting in the development of a training version for internal government use only.

Since the shutdown of &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; in 2022, the website of the game now redirects to the &quot;Go Army&quot; website.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army 2&quot; ===
On November 6, 2003, version 2.0 of &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; was released, with the full title of &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Special Forces&quot;. In a booklet produced by the MOVES Institute, an article by Wagner James Au explains that &quot;the Department of Defense wants to double the number of Special Forces soldiers; consequently, orders trickled down the chain of command and found application in the current release of America&#x27;s Army&quot;.

As the game became more widely distributed, it generated additional media interest. In December 2003, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; columnist said &quot;&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; isn&#x27;t just a time-wasting shoot-&#x27;em-up. It&#x27;s full of accurate information about military training and tactics, intended to prepare a new generation of potential recruits. Amidst all the shouting drill sergeants and whistling bullets, some real education is going on. &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; is a &#x27;serious game&#x27;, part of a new wave of computer simulations that provide entertaining lessons about real-world activities.&quot;

After the game proved successful, the lack of the Army&#x27;s acknowledgment for the contribution by the U.S. Navy led to tension and political fights over the project. Eventually, the project was withdrawn from the Naval Postgraduate School due to allegations of mismanagement in March 2004 and the development team was moved to two new locations.

One month after taking over production, the army signed an exclusive long-term contract with Ubisoft to reach a wider and younger audience. &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Rise of a Soldier&quot;, a different version of the game for the Xbox, was produced by Ubisoft in collaboration with the U.S. Army. Despite a 10-year publishing deal, the control over all communication and advertising remains with the army. The Xbox version was released in November 2005. It was also due to be released on the PlayStation 2, but was later canceled. A version of the game was also made for mobile phones by Gameloft.

About this time America&#x27;s Army 2.5 Assist started out as a fix for a no longer working server list for Mac OSX based computers. It is still working today as America&#x27;s Army 2.x deploy client that people can use to play the game.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; ===
It was announced in early 2008 that &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; would be released in &quot;fall 2008&quot;. Due to technical issues and problems with software licenses, the game release was delayed and rescheduled for &quot;some time in 2009&quot;. &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; entered beta testing in late 2008 and was released on June 17, 2009. Although &quot;America&#x27;s Army 3&quot; was an entirely new game created using the Unreal Engine 3, there were still several similarities between previous versions of &quot;America&#x27;s Army,&quot; including similar training exercises. AA3 emphasized graphical performance and flexibility to cover a broader range of PCs as well as decreased size for the full version of the software. The game also featured fictional weapons for the enemy, as opposed to the Soviet and Warsaw Pact based weapons used in the previous versions. Although the game had initial problems with online play, it worked well offline. A hotfix was launched shortly after the game&#x27;s release which addressed several problems with the authorization servers not being able to register that players had completed training. Five days after release, players were once again able to play online.

One day after the launch, the civilian developer&#x27;s team contracted until game release was dismissed. Responsibility for the development of the game was passed on to the Army Game Studio, part of the AMRDEC Software Engineering Directorate at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama. The Army Game Studio houses the development and management staff for &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; outreach products as well as numerous Military and Government applications.

==== Teamwarfare league ====
Finnish [PCM] clan holds the record for the longest winning streak in the 20-year America&#x27;s Army video game history.

[PCM] did not lose a single match for 388 days in 2011-2012 and in the same year they won the world championship in the game&#x27;s most prestigious series, the teamwarfare league.

Finnish team was successful mainly because of Mmichael, who was generally considered the second best aimer in the world. Also the team leader intRaZ played a significant role in creating tactics where the team was superior on maps such as Stronghold, Ranch and Pipeline.

In long distance maps like Bridge was chosen to play Olvi, he was considered the best long distance player in the world in 2005-2007. Nuba, Wilekala, Dives, Jakke and Terzi also brought firepower to the team. tuksu82 also played an important role as a machine gun man.

In the World Championship finals [PCM] beat the [?]NoPlan clan 7-5. You could say that the Finns were lucky in terms of map selection because they got their favorite map for the Stronghold final. In particular, NoPlan clan player Flatlander produced difficulties for pcm. [?]Flatlander was considered the greatest player in AA3 era.

The team&#x27;s record winning streak was broken when the German national team managed to beat pcm in shantytown 4-3. Pcm used the inexperienced but promising player Shrubbie in the match, who cracked under the pressure and remained without any kills in the match.

However, the most famous pcm match was not the world championship final, but the match against the Italian amateur team TOS clan.

This was because Italian player -=]ToS[=-OxYgEn used aimbot in a match against pcm and the Italians still lost both matches. the Italian was later caught cheating.

The public noticed the auto aim immediately, but it took months before the Italian player was banned by esl, aci and uac. to protest the bad anticheat software, pcm published a video on YouTube showing the cheating of an Italian. Tos team became a common joke in the professional scene, because they didn&#x27;t even win by cheating

The Finnish team retired when the fourth version of the video game was released.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; ===
On August 28, 2012, the developers were taking suggestions for a new &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; game, the fourth in &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; series. The game, which is called &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot;, was released in an open beta on Steam on August 29, 2013. During the open beta, the developers had been updating the game with new maps and features as the game evolved. The beta ended on October 1, 2015, with the full release of the game, introducing new features and a new look and feel. &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; brings back many features from previous games, and stresses small unit tactical maneuvers and training that reflects the current day army. The game includes a mission editor, a feature brought back from &quot;America&#x27;s Army 2&quot;.

=== &quot;America&#x27;s Army 5&quot; ===
In August 2018, a developer confirmed that the Army was beginning development on &quot;America&#x27;s Army 5&quot; (or AAV). As of December 2024, the project remains vaporware.

== &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Rise of a Soldier&quot; ==

&quot;America&#x27;s Army: Rise of a Soldier&quot; was released for Xbox in November 2005. According to the press release, the game features &quot;all the action-packed realism that players have come to expect from the &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; game brand&quot; and &quot;offers the most true-to-life Army experience, allowing players to create a soldier and lead him through the excitement of an Army career&quot;.

== &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Special Operations&quot; ==
In February 2007, Gameloft and the U.S. Army released &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Special Operations&quot; for mobile phones. The game features two types of gameplay; players can man an armored vehicle or serve as an infantryman. According to Mobi Critic, &quot;Gameloft does a great job with this game and the only fault one could find is that the game is too short. It isn&#x27;t, really: you just won&#x27;t realize how fast the hours of play have passed, as this game really gives the term &#x27;action packed&#x27; a new meaning.&quot;

== Arcade game ==
The arcade version of &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; was developed by Global VR and released in July 2007. It is billed as a &quot;realistic and engaging game centered on exciting training exercises and includes a significant amount of authentic Army videos&quot;.

== &quot;America&#x27;s Army: True Soldiers&quot; ==

&quot;America&#x27;s Army: True Soldiers&quot; was released for the Xbox 360 in November 2007. It had both a single-player campaign and multiplayer features on Xbox Live. &quot;True Soldiers&quot; focused on the Army&#x27;s core values by incorporating game play based on mission accomplishment, teamwork, leadership, and rules of engagement.

== Real Heroes ==
&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; Real Heroes program, launched in September 2006, focused on specific soldiers who had been recognized for various acts. Described in an article from &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, the idea of the Real Heroes program is &quot;to tout ordinary people who, when thrust into danger, showed extraordinary courage&quot;.

The Real Heroes program used videos, photo albums and blogs on the Real Heroes website to depict the lives of nine U.S. Army, Reserve, and National Guard Soldiers featured in the program. Soldiers&#x27; likenesses and biographies were incorporated into &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; game and used to create action figures sold at retail stores and distributed at Army events. Additionally, those featured in the Real Heroes program made media appearances at &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; events across the country, such as the Virtual Army Experience, gaming competitions and Technology Education programs. On January 23, 2007, Real Hero Sergeant Tommy Rieman was recognized by President George W. Bush during his State of the Union address. President Bush affirmed, &quot;And like so many other Americans who have volunteered to defend us, he has earned the respect and the gratitude of our country.&quot;


== Government applications ==
According to game historian Carrie McLeroy, &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; has &quot;grown in ways its originators couldn&#x27;t have imagined&quot;. Dozens of government training and simulation applications using &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; platform have been developed to train and educate U.S. Army soldiers.

In 2005, &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; developers partnered with the Software Engineering Directorate and the Army&#x27;s Aviation and Missile Research Development Engineering Center in Huntsville, Alabama, to manage the commercial game development process and use the &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; platform to create government training and simulations. &quot;&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; has pushed to reuse the same elements for many purposes&quot;, said Colonel Wardynski, the originator of the game. &quot;We can build one soldier avatar and use it again and again. When we build something in &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot;, the U.S. government owns it completely ... and [it] can, therefore, be used for any application or use of the game. So costs keep going down.&quot; After &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; went live, requests started coming in to use the game for purposes other than recruiting, such as training.

The partnership with SED, an Army software life cycle management center, allowed the development team to re-purpose the commercial software to meet the needs of soldiers preparing for deployment. SED engineers developed customized applications used by many different Army and government organizations, including the JFK Special Forces School and the Army&#x27;s Chemical School. They are used to provide training in the use of rare equipment such as PackBot robots, CROWS, and Nuclear Biological Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicles.

=== Virtual Army Experience ===
The Virtual Army Experience (VAE) was a mobile U.S. Army simulator that launched in February 2007. The VAE, enclosed in a inflatable dome, was displayed at public events across the U.S., such as NASCAR races and air shows, and allowed participants to virtually experience aspects of soldiering. The core of VAE was the America&#x27;s Army game reworked to provide a variety of scenarios. The VAE could be deployed in a single full-scale rendition or split into two smaller versions enabling it to appear at separate events. During its lifetime, the VAE hosted over 130,000 participants at more than 100 events.

=== Army Experience Center ===
From August 29, 2008, to July 31, 2010, the U.S. Army operated the Army Experience Center, a facility where visitors could virtually experience many aspects of Army life. Located inside the Franklin Mills Mall in Philadelphia, the facility featured a number of interactive simulations and online learning programs to inform visitors about Army careers, training, and educational opportunities.

Pete Geren, Secretary of the Army, said, &quot;Potential recruits are afforded a unique opportunity through the Army Experience Center to learn what it means to be the best-led, best-trained and best-equipped Army in the world by allowing them to virtually experience multiple aspects of the Army.&quot; The head of Army Recruiting Command, Major General Thomas Bostick, called the AEC &quot;a learning laboratory&quot;—but not just for those who are thinking of joining. &quot;It&#x27;s incumbent upon the American public to know about their Army&quot;, Bostick said. In July 2010, the Army closed the center at the end of its two-year pilot program.

=== Technology Education Program ===
Launched in 2007, the Technology Education Program provided real-world applications of classroom learning that augmented the curriculum in academic areas including math, physical science, physics, chemistry, technology, computer science, art, animation, graphic design, social studies, anatomy, physiology, and psychology. Army experts and soldiers worked with students to teach them about robotics, optics, missiles, video games, and intellectual, emotional and physical development.

In April 2008, Discovery Education featured &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; in a live webinar in which over 1000 students and educators participated with game developers and software engineers.

== Comics ==
With the first issue published June 14, 2013, &quot;America&#x27;s Army: Proving Grounds&quot; debuted a new storyline in a fully digital comic series through IDW Publishing. The &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; Comics series, available on the web and for mobile devices, unveils the story line that influences the plot for the game&#x27;s missions and maps and gives the player a better understanding of their assignment and the challenges they will face. In the series, players learn the saga of American forces deployed to the Ostregal Islands, a tiny foreign nation in the middle of a chaotic conflict.

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; comics series allowed readers to further explore the &quot;Army&quot; universe and delve deep into the lives of Soldiers who are deployed or at home station. Readers learn about Soldiers and the missions they do, their values, jobs, or Military Occupational Specialties (MOS), the high-tech equipment they use, and about the vast team of support on which they rely. The comics are free and available to read on a browser or mobile device, through the &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; website, or through IDW publishing using comiXology, Apple Books, Nook, Kindle, and others.

The comics tell the story of U.S. Soldiers deployed to a tiny foreign nation in the middle of a chaotic conflict. The description for the series reads: &quot;From the seemingly insignificant country of Czervenia, President-General Adzic and his army set upon a campaign of annihilation against the neighboring Republic of the Ostregals, setting in motion a mysterious plan that could change the course of world power forever. America&#x27;s Army must create new experimental combat teams, forged together in secret Proving Grounds, and uncover the General&#x27;s insidious plot before time runs out.&quot;

The last issue was published April 15, 2015. 

== Reception ==
&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; has been generally positively received. GameSpot stated: &quot;nothing beats going in and seeing what the Army really does. Without actually having to do it.&quot; The game has a rating of 82 on Metacritic.

== Controversy ==
&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; has been described as an extension of the military entertainment complex (militainment) with criticism that it contributes to a militarization of society. Because &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; focuses on the technological aspect of war rather than the moral, it has been referred to as &quot;How We Fight&quot;, alluding to the U.S. government&#x27;s series of films named &quot;Why We Fight&quot;, which supported the war effort for World War II.

Media theorist David B. Nieborg criticized the game and noted that its mechanics are a careful blend of propaganda, advertising, and education. Use of the game by recruitment and training centers has been criticized and protested against, among others by the Veterans for Peace group. Its use in schools as a recruiting tool aimed at children has also been criticized.

From 2006 to 2011, artist and academic Joseph DeLappe carried out a protest titled &quot;Dead-in-Iraq&quot; using &quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; by logging onto the game&#x27;s servers and using the in-game messaging function to type the name, age, service branch, and date of death of the over 4,000 American soldiers killed during the Iraq War, in response to the game&#x27;s purpose as an army recruitment tool.

&quot;America&#x27;s Army&quot; has gained the interest of numerous professionals in the fields of business, economics, and social science. A partial list of published analyses includes:

* Allen&#x27;s book based on ethnographic research detailing the history and culture of development behind the video game.
* 
* Details the 2009 layoffs of the America&#x27;s Army game development team; and the cognitive/immaterial labor undertaken in the video game industry.
* 
* Edery, a Microsoft Xbox executive and research affiliate of the MIT Comparative Media Studies Program, and Mollick, researcher at the MIT Sloan School of Management, investigate the future of video games. They cite the combat medic training received by Paxton Galvanek to save a life as &quot;tangible evidence of the power of games to educate&quot;. (p. 97) Furthermore, the book praises America&#x27;s Army by saying &quot;Far-sighted companies are using games to recruit, train, motivate, and make employees more productive&quot; (p. 97) and includes research that supports this point: &quot;30% of all Americans age 16 to 24 had a more positive impression of the Army because of the game and, even more amazingly, the game had more impact on recruits than all other forms of Army advertising combined.&quot; (p. 141)
* The authors test the stability of old, traditional media and find they are collapsing under pressure from online services. It highlights the U.S. Army video game as the 21st century&#x27;s recruitment poster. &quot;America&#x27;s Army has proven to be such powerful weaponry that an official game store does brisk business selling collectible action figures, clothes, coffee mugs, and other doodads emblazoned with the logo.&quot; (p. 90)
* Lendermann, creative director of GMR Marketing, cites AA advergaming success and rollout to an experiential marketing campaign. &quot;The America&#x27;s Army experience is an advergaming juggernaut, an empire that is looked to enviably by the rest of the advergaming nations.&quot; (p. 218) &quot;Not only do players get a fun and exciting experience, they also get as close to the real thing of being in the army as possible, without actually getting a buzz cut and general-issue fatigues.&quot; (p. 222)
* This book cites America&#x27;s Army as one of the most innovative and successful examples of virtual placemaking and Col. Wardynski&#x27;s efforts in establishing new and better metric analyses. &quot;According to the director of the program, Colonel Casey Wardynski, 20 percent of those matriculating at West Point in 2005 had played America&#x27;s Army, along with 20 to 40 percent of enlisted soldiers recruited that year.&quot; (p. 168) &quot;America&#x27;s Army director Colonel Wardynski uses the metric &#x27;cost per person hour&#x27;, estimating in 2005 that the million the Army puts into the program each year results in &#x27;a cost per person hour of 10 cents, versus $5 to $8 for TV&#x27;.&quot; (p. 173)
* Career Innovation Case Study of the U.S. Army as part of the &quot;Digital Generation Initiative&quot;. This case study analyzed the Army game project efforts and concluded the following: First, to reach the Digital Generation, content must be engaging and authentic. Employers will have to adopt a much more open and transparent approach to communicating information and allowing contact with employees than is currently the norm. Second, the Digital Generation will expect to be able to virtually explore and even &quot;test drive&quot; jobs and organizations. The Army&#x27;s experience shows the potential and importance of virtual tools and capabilities in shaping the brand image of employers. Third, games and simulations can play a role in preparing new hires for the job. And finally, employers should treat investments in games and simulations as a platform to support a wide range of recruiting, learning and performance development activities and goals. Virtual simulators are cheaper than real ones in many instances.
* Includes ethnographic analysis of soldiers who played the game during the invasion of Iraq, and interviews with West Point directors of the America&#x27;s Army project.
* Galloway, an associate professor at New York University notes that &quot;What is interesting about America&#x27;s Army, is not the debate over whether it is thinly-veiled propaganda or a legitimate recruitment tool, for it is unabashedly and decisively both, but rather that the central conceit of the game is one of mimetic realism.&quot; In his analysis, Galloway concludes that AA, despite being a fairly realistic game, with real-life settings, does not make even the least attempt to achieve narrative realism—that is, accurately representing what serving a tour in the Army would actually be like. Instead, it simply expresses a nationalistic sentiment under the guise of realism, being little more than a &quot;naïve and unmediated or reflective conception of aesthetic construction&quot;.

<text>Halden (), between 1665 and 1928 known as Fredrikshald, is both a town and a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The municipality borders Sarpsborg to the northwest, Rakkestad to the north and Aremark to the east, as well as the Swedish municipalities Strömstad, Tanum and Dals-Ed respectively to the southwest, south and southeast.

The seat of the municipality, Halden is a border town located at the mouth of the Tista river on the Iddefjord, the southernmost border crossing between Norway and Sweden. The town of Halden is located about south of Oslo, north of Gothenburg, and west of the border crossing at Svinesund.

==History==
Evidence of early human settlements in this region of Norway have been found, particularly in the Svinesund area of the municipality where evidence of early settlements from the Nordic Bronze Age have been found. Named after a small farm &quot;Hallen&quot; () first mentioned in 1629, &quot;Halden&quot;, became the city of &quot;Fredrikshald&quot; in 1665, named after Frederick III of Denmark. The &quot;Gud med oss&quot; (&quot;God be with us&quot;) coat-of-arms created in 1665 shows a knight standing on a mountain, yellow on a blue background, and was inspired by the bravery of the citizens of the city in the Dano-Swedish War (1658–1660).

Swedish forces unsuccessfully attempted to invade the town six times between 1658 and 1814. As a reference to the town&#x27;s citizens burning their own houses to prevent them being taken on 4 July 1716 by the forces of King Charles XII of Sweden, Halden is one of only two cities in Norway&#x27;s national anthem. In 1718, the Great Northern War ended when Charles XII was shot and killed at the Fredriksten fortress. The fortress had been erected in the 17th century as a replacement for the Bohus Fortress lost at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658 when Bohuslän was ceded to Sweden. Halden has never been captured by force by any invading army, although it was occupied by Nazi forces in WWII.

In an 1835 census, Fredrikshald was the seventh largest town or city in Norway, with 4,921 inhabitants. In 1838, Fredrikshald became a city municipality (), and in 1928, the name was changed back to Halden. Tistedalen, which is east of Halden, was part of the city from 1686 to 1967, until it was separated from Halden. At the same time, the area of Halden, Tistedalen, and the rural municipalities of Berg and Idd, became the Halden municipality on 1 January 1967.

==Politics==
The political situation in Halden has become infamous in Norway for conflicts between individual politicians and between local political parties.
The municipality is governed by the Conservative Party, the Liberal Party, the Christian Democratic Party, the Centre Party, and the Green Party.
==Economy==
The slogan, &quot;Halden, IT- og Miljøbyen&quot; (Halden, IT and Environment City), is a reference to Halden&#x27;s relatively large number of information technology companies. In the late 1960s, the most powerful mainframe computer in Norway at the time was located at the Institute for Energy Technology&#x27;s facilities in Halden. From the 1960s-1980s, Halden was infamous for high levels of industrial pollution, largely originating from the Norske Skog Saugbrugs paper mill (part of Norske Skog since 1989). As a result of projects initiated by both Norske Skog-Saugbrugs and the city authorities, the polluted fjords and rivers of Halden have been cleaned up and the city was dubbed Norway&#x27;s Environment City in 1996.

One of Norway&#x27;s two nuclear reactors under decommissioning is located in Halden. The Halden Boiling Water Reactor is a research reactor located within Månefjell, adjacent to the Saugbrugs paper mill. The OECD Halden Reactor Project is one of the world&#x27;s longest running international research collaborations and is the largest international research project in Norway. While the reactor closed in 2018, safety-oriented research collaboration for the nuclear power industry has continued, focusing primarily on human-technology-organisation research. In 2024, Halden municipality took part in the creation of Halden Kjernekraft AS and initiated investigation for the possible construction of a Small Modular Reactor; a location has since been identified. IFE&#x27;s Man-Technology-Organisation Lab facility in Os Alle was opened by the Prince Regent in 2004 and houses the most recent incarnations of the Halden Man-Machine Laboratory (HAMMLAB) and Halden Virtual Reality Centre&#x27;s (HVRC) VR laboratory. IFE also has advanced robotics and cybersecurity labs in Halden. The Halden Project at IFE has ensured a steady influx of international guest scientists to the city, many of whom made Halden their permanent homes.

Nexans has a large cable factory in Halden. The main products from this factory are submarine power cables, umbilical cables for subsea installations, and cable systems for heating of subsea pipelines.

==Rød Herregård==

Rød Herregård in Halden is one of the best preserved manor houses in Norway. The property features well-preserved buildings, a Baroque garden and an English landscape garden. The buildings have their oldest origins of the late 1600s, but were largely built during the last half of the 1700s. The main building contains authentic furnishings including period furniture, hunting trophies, an extensive collection of art and a large weapons collection.
Rød Herregård was owned and inhabited by members of the Tank and Anker families from 1733 including Carsten Tank and Nils Otto Tank as well as Peter Martin Anker and Nils Anker. The manor house and estate complex was owned by the Tank family through three generations, from 1733 to 1829. Both Danish Crown Prince regent Christian Frederik and Swedish Crown Prince and Regent Charles John were guests at the mansion. The estate was visited by English economist Thomas Robert Malthus during his European tour in 1799.

In 1961, two foundations were established to maintain the historic property. Rød Manor Foundation (&quot;Stiftelsen Rød Herregård&quot;) is responsible for the manor house, buildings and gardens. Ankerske Foundation Collections (&quot;Stiftelsen De Ankerske Samlinger&quot;) is responsible for the contents and the rich archives related to the property.

==Notable sights==
Halden sights include the Halden Canal system, the two Svinesund bridges, and Høiåsmasten, a partially guyed TV tower. The fortress of Fredriksten has historical museums, and the Østfold University College (&quot;Høgskolen i Østfold&quot;) is in Halden which offer business, social sciences, foreign language, computer science and education.

Petroglyphs (rock carvings) dated from the Nordic Bronze Age are found around town, some locally, but more impressive are ones found along &quot;Oldtidsveien&quot;, the historical road between Halden and Fredrikstad some north, and around Tanum in Sweden, some to the south. Jellhaugen, a major tumulus (grave mound) is found west of town, situated only 120 feet away from the site of the later discovered Gjellestad Ship.

==Nature==
Halden is surrounded by forests and water, so hiking and fishing locations can easily be found. Deer and elk are a common sight, and wolves have also been observed in the district along the border with Sweden. Raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, wild cranberries, and many varieties of mushroom can be found in the woods in the early autumn. Popular destinations for hikers and other nature lovers include Prestebakke and Kornsjø.

Halden&#x27;s meteorological station is at Buer.
==Gjellestad ship burial==

The Gjellestad () ship, also spelt Jellestad, is the remains of a Viking Age longship found at the farm of Gjellestad in Halden municipality in Norway in 2018 by the archeologists Lars Gustavsen and Erich Nau. A 2019 examination by the University of Oslo has dated it to earliest AD 733. Originally interred beneath a burial mound, in the present day the ship lies 40 centimetres below the topsoil due to years of ploughing.

Due to extensive fungus damage to the hull caused by field drainage, drought and exposure to the air, archaeologists called for an immediate dig to save the ship. Excavation of the ship at Gjellestad began in June 2020, and is led by Christian L. Rødsrud of the Museum of Cultural History. It is estimated to be over 20 metres long, although only parts of the keel have survived. This would mean that the boat is of a similar size to the Gokstad ship. The identity of the boat&#x27;s occupant has not yet been confirmed, but experts have speculated that it may have belonged to a king or queen.

==Culture==
Outdoor concerts are frequently held at the fortress while the local churches, pubs, and student union are regular venues for indoor concerts. Musicians recorded by the Hitsville and Athletic Sound studios in the Halden region include Motorpsycho, Madrugada, Morten Harket, and Kurt Nilsen. The city&#x27;s intimate theatre hosts frequent plays by national and local theatre groups, and occasionally serves as a concert hall.

Halden festivals include Tons of Rock (hard rock and metal) in June each year (from 2014 before the festival was moved to Oslo in 2019) and a vegetarian food festival in August. 

Artists born in Halden that are represented in the Norwegian National Gallery in Oslo include Thomas Fearnley (1802–1842) and Jacob Mathias Calmeyer (1802–1883). Fearnley is locally exhibited at the manor house Rød Herregård. Other significant artists that lived in Halden, but were not born there, include Johannes Fintoe (1786–1870) and Heinrich August Grosch (1763–1843). Grosch&#x27;s son, Christian Heinrich Grosch (1801–1865), who moved with his parents to Halden at the age of ten, became an influential architect, whose works include seventy-eight churches (including Immanuel Church in Halden), the Bank of Norway, the Oslo Stock Exchange, and the original university buildings in Oslo.

Current archaeological excavations includes Jellestadskipet (Gjellestadskipet) located a stone&#x27;s throw from Jellhaugen; it was first photographed in 2018.

===Sports===
The Halden VBK volleyball club plays in the Premier Division, and while the local ice hockey team Comet did play in the GET-league (Norway&#x27;s highest ice hockey division) for some years, but they ran into some financial problems in 2008/2009, and is now in division 1. Halden also has many football clubs, the biggest of them, Kvik Halden FK, plays in the Norwegian Second Division. The two handball clubs, Tistedalens TIF in the first division and HK Halden, have teams for children, youth and adults.

One of Norway&#x27;s few curling centres lies in Halden. Halden Curling Center is host to East-Norway 1 division. In addition there is a separate amateur league with two divisions. Several curlers from Halden have won Norwegian championships and competed internationally.

Halden&#x27;s forests are a good place for orienteering; and hiking, canoeing, boating, fishing, and gymnastics are also popular sports amongst Halden&#x27;s population.

==Halden&#x27;s prison==
Halden fengsel is one of Norway&#x27;s highest-security jails. It has acquired a “reputation as the world&#x27;s most humane prison.” The architectural design of this prison is not like other prisons. The conditions inside the prison have been made as much like life outside the walls as possible. It is in fact to create an environment “as unprisonlike as possible.” This reflects the flagship of the Norwegian justice system, which focuses on rehabilitation rather than punishment.

To explore what makes incarceration in Norway different from being imprisoned in other countries, British journalist Raphael Rowe
spent a week at Halden Prison for the Netflix documentary &quot;Inside the World&#x27;s Toughest Prisons&quot; (Season 3, Episode 4).

<text>Sarpsborg ( ), historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg.

Sarpsborg is part of the fifth largest urban area in Norway when paired with neighbouring Fredrikstad. As of 1 January 2018, according to Statistics Norway these two municipalities have a total population of 136,127 with 55,840 in Sarpsborg and 81,278 in Fredrikstad.

Statistics for 2021, say that the city has a population where 19% of the children belong to families that have &quot;low-income in the long-term&quot;; that is the highest level for a city (in Norway); the national level is 11.3%.

==General information==

===Name===

In Norse times the city was just called &quot;Borg&quot; (from &quot;borg&quot; which means &quot;castle&quot;). The background for this was the fortification built by Olav Haraldsson (see History section). Later the genitive case of the name of the waterfall &quot;Sarpr&quot; (Sarp Falls) was added, it&#x27;s unclear how Sarpsborg received this part of its name, two interpretations are the most prevalent. The first coming from the Icelandic word &quot;Sarpr&quot; which means birdcage in English. The other interpretation is that &quot;Sarpr&quot; means &quot;the one who swallows&quot;, probably referring to the local waterfall.

In Norse times Østfold county was called &quot;Borgarsýsla&quot; which means &quot;the county (sýsla) of Borg&quot; and the law district of southeast Norway was called &quot;Borgarþing&quot; meaning &quot;the thing/court of Borg&quot;.

The old name has been revived in the diocese of Borg (1968) and Borgarting Court of Appeal (1995).

===Coat of arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times and was granted on 13 November 1991. It is based on a coat of arms dating from 1556 and shows a bear above a castle. The bear was introduced as early as some time in the 13th century, by the earl of Sarpsborg &quot;(Comes de Saresburgh)&quot;, Alv Erlingsson. He used the bear to symbolise his strength. The castle symbolises the fortress (borg) that gave the city its original name.

==History==

The city was founded as &quot;Borg&quot; by the Viking King Olav Haraldsson (Saint Olaf) in 1016. It was burned to the ground by Swedish invaders in 1567 during the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War. Half the population was evacuated down the river to what is today known as Fredrikstad, about downstream.

Much of the rebuilt town disappeared into the river Glomma during a 1702 mudslide. Again Borg was rebuilt, and it was recreated as a city in 1839, and separated from Tune as a municipality of its own.

The rural municipalities of Tune, Skjeberg, and Varteig were merged with the city on 1 January 1992. The population is steadily growing, and during the summer of 2005 it reached 50,000 inhabitants.

In 2016 the town celebrated its 1,000th anniversary, and the entire year was commemorated by a special programme that encouraged historic preservation within the town.

Historically, the sawmill and timber shipping industry has been Sarpsborg&#x27;s most important sources of income, however since the industrialisation in Norway, more specifically Sarpsborg and the establishment of local manufacturing businesses during the late 1800s, the biggest being Borregaard, Sarpsborg has changed from its traditional timber-based economy and pre-industrial society to a more manufacturing and refining-based economy and industrial society. In modern times Sarpsborg has moved away from being a city based on the local manufacturing and refining industry, with only around ten percent employed within the local manufacturing industry, coinciding with Norway&#x27;s general shift towards a post-industrial society. Despite this, the city is still widely regarded by Norwegians both unofficially and officially, to be an industrial city.

==Economy==
Borregaard Industries is, and always has been, the most important industry in the city. The city is also the home of Borg Bryggerier, part of the Hansa Borg Bryggerier, which is Norway&#x27;s second largest brewery-group.

==Sport==
During the 1950s and 1960s, Sarpsborg was famous for its football (soccer) team, Sarpsborg FK, but is now more known for its ice hockey team, Sparta Warriors. In football, Sarpsborg 08 FF has taken over the local throne, currently playing at the highest national level. On 6 November 2009, they sent arch-rival FFK down from the top division in a play-off game in Fredrikstad stadion. Sarpsborg 08 has a women&#x27;s football team that was promoted to the women&#x27;s Division 1 at the end of 2011, at the same time as the club&#x27;s under-19 girls reached the Junior Cup Final. Sarpsborg BK plays in the highest bandy division.

Sarpsborg is famous for its two elite leagues teams in floorball, Sarpsborg IBK and Greåker IBK.

==Climate==
Sarpsborg has a humid continental climate (Dfb) or temperate oceanic climate (Cfb), depending on winter threshold used ( as in US or as in Europe). The all-time high was recorded in July 2018. The all-time low was set in December 2002. Since the weather station was incepted in 1991, the records may not be representative of a longer time frame. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below ) in spring is 20 April and average date for first freeze in autumn is 22 October giving a frost-free season of 184 days (1981-2010 average).

<text>Hvaler is a municipality that is a group of islands in the southern part of Østfold County, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Skjærhalden, on the island of Kirkeøy. The only police station in the municipality is located in Skjærhalden. Hvaler was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see &quot;formannskapsdistrikt&quot;).

==Name==
The name is the plural form of &quot;hval&quot;, which means &quot;whale&quot;. The form and shape of the islands resemble a pod of whales. Prior to 1889, the name was spelled Hvaløerne, meaning the whale isles.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. It was granted on 9 December 1983. The arms show a silver-colored boat on a blue background. This boat is the type that was typical in the 13th century. This was chosen since this island municipality has been dependent on boats for all its history, and because fisheries and sailing have been the main economic activities for many centuries.

==Culture==
&quot;Hvalerdrakten&quot; is the traditional costume or &quot;bunad&quot; for women in Hvaler. The bodice and skirt are blue or black and are made from 100% wool. The shirt is white and made from 100% cotton. Several symbolic expressions exist in the embroideries and the accompanying silver brooches. The embroidered flowers are characteristic to the islands&#x27; flora and symbolize the different islands that constitute the municipality. All the silver that belongs to the costume is portraying the locally famous Hvalerbåten (The Boat of Hvaler) and herring, which has been an important commodity to the islands through the ages. All patterns used in this costume have been patented.
Since 1999, &quot;hvalerdrakten&quot; have been manufactured by Hvalerdraktstua AS.

==Hvaler Church==
Hvaler Church (&quot;Hvaler Kirke&quot;) is a medieval-era church, probably begun around 1000-1100 AD. Hvaler Church is the main church of the archipelago. It is located on Kirkeøy in the extreme south of the parish. It is a stone church with a rectangular nave and narrow choir and apse. The pulpit is from the 1600s. In 1750, the church received a new altar which in 1759 was supplemented with an altarpiece mounted on the altar. Between 1953 and 1955, the church went through a thorough restoration led by antiquarian Håkon Christie in connection with the church&#x27;s restoration. The J. H. Jorgensen organ is from 1955.

==Geography==
South of Skjærhalden lies a chain of a few inhabitable islands and several hundreds of smaller islands and rocks. The bigger islands are named, clockwise, Nordre Sandøy, Søndre Sandøy, Hærføl, Søndre Lauer, and Nordre Lauer. Another smaller island is Tisler. On all of these islands, with the exception of Søndre Lauer, summer houses fill the landscape. The islands of Søndre Sandøy and Hærføl are the two only islands that have local shops and roads which support car traffic.

Nordre Sandøy, situated on the north end of this chain of islands in southern Hvaler, is one of the largest islands with a distinct flora and fauna diversity. Although equipped with a good stretch of roads, car traffic is forbidden there and no commercial activity whatsoever exists. In many ways, this gives its population (mostly summertime vacationers) a greater feeling of isolation from the average Norwegian&#x27;s hectic life, and it acts as a buffer against pollution. Nordre Sandøy is thought to have been one of the bases of Peter Tordenskjold during his time as a privateer. One of the bays on the island is named &quot;Tordenskjoldsbukta&quot; (). The remains of two dead pirates have been found on the island. Legend has it that he buried some of his treasure on the island. In 1997, a local boy, Simon Rene Magnussen, found three old golden coins while scuba diving in the area.

== Notable people ==
* Egil Abrahamsen (born 1923 in Hvaler, died 2023), Norwegian ships engineer
* Vebjørn Sand (born 1966 in Bærum), Norwegian painter and artist who was brought up in Hvaler

The Norse form of the name was &quot;Aramǫrk&quot;. The first element is the genitive of the name of the lake &quot;Ari&quot; (now Aremarksjøen).

== Culture ==
Every two years in Aremark there is a relatively large festival: &quot;Elgfestivalen&quot; (elk festival). It is held in a festivity area at Kirkeng Camping. It has been arranged every two years since September 1998. The festival begins Friday afternoon and lasts until Sunday afternoon.

=== Religion ===
There are two chapels/churches in Aremark. Aremark church, which is located near Kirkeng(Church meadow), and Holmgil chapel in Bjørkebekk (Birch creek).

=== Television ===
Aremark has been used in several movie titles and in television. The Norwegian movies &quot;Folk flest bor i Kina&quot; (Most people live in China) and &quot;Celofan&quot; are both filmed in the municipality.

<text>Rømskog was a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Rømskog. The former municipality of Rømskog was separated from Rødenes on 1 January 1902.

Rømskog was well known as one of the smallest municipalities in Norway, in numbers of citizens, with just above 600 citizens.

The word &quot;skog&quot; means &quot;forest&quot; in Norwegian, and that is what Rømskog consists of together with the agricultural landscape. Farms and huge / deep forests and small lakes like the lake of Rømsjøen. Deep forests that Rømskog shares with the neighbouring municipalities across the border of Sweden.

Slavasshøgda is a hill in Rømskog, and is the highest point in former Østfold county at .

At January 1. 2020 Rømskog merged with neighbouring Aurskog-Høland kommune (municipality).

The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Rymsskógr&quot;. The first element is the genitive case of the name of the lake &quot;Rymr&quot; (now Rømsjøen) and the last element is &quot;skógr&quot; which means &quot;wood&quot; or &quot;forest&quot;. The meaning of the name &quot;Rymr&quot; is unknown.

<text>Trøgstad was a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Skjønhaug. The municipality included the parishes of Skjønhaug, Havnås and Båstad. The parish of &quot;Trygstad&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Trøgstad is now part of the municipality Indre Østfold.

The scene of the crime for the World War II-era Feldmann case is at Skrikerudtjernet in Trøgstad.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Trøgstad&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Þrygsstaðir&quot; and/or &quot;Þrjúgsstaðir&quot;), since the first church was built here. The meaning of the first element is not known (maybe a male nickname) and the last element is &quot;staðir&quot; which means &quot;homestead&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;. Prior to 1889, the name was written &quot;Trygstad&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms is from modern times. They were granted on 24 August 1979. The arms show an anvil and was chosen because Trøgstad historically was well known for the quality of its blacksmiths who made iron tools and objects. The green background of the shield symbolizes the fields and forests in the municipality. The arms were designed by Truls Nygaard.

===Trøgstad Church===
Trøgstad Church (&quot;Trøgstad kirke&quot;) is a medieval era, stone church. It belongs to Østre Borgesyssel deanery in Diocese of Borg. The church is located on a ridge south of Øyeren. The church is of Romanesque architecture and has a rectangular nave with a lower and narrower choir.

The church is probably built ca. 1250. It was the equipped with turret with a bell tower ca. 1620. This had to be demolished and replaced with a new tower in 1700. A sacristy was built by the choir&#x27;s north face in 1697. In 1904 the church was extended and rebuilt, the western wall and the porch were demolished and choir was extended. After rebuilding the church has approximately 350 seats.

<text>Askim () is a town and a former municipality in (from January 1, 2020) Indre Østfold municipality in the county of Østfold, Norway. 

The administrative centre of the Askim municipality was the town of Askim. Askim was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Askim is the largest population centre in the Indre Østfold region, with 15,315 inhabitants as of 2012, and serves as a regional center for nine municipalities in the Indre Østfold region. It lies next to the longest river in Norway, Glomma, which forms the border with the former Spydeberg municipality to the north and west, and Skiptvet municipality to the south. Askim also borders to the former Trøgstad municipality to the northeast and the former Eidsberg municipality to the southeast.

Askim produces large amounts of hydroelectricity at three dams / hydroelectric power plants in the river Glomma. From upstream to downstream: Solbergfoss, Kykkelsrud, then Vamma.

There was nickel mining at Kykkelsrud at the turn of the 20th century. These mines are also one of the few places where &quot;Spheroidal Norite&quot; (&quot;Potato Stone&quot;) is found.

Askim has been an industrial city for most of the 20th century. The main employer, Viking Gummi (producing rubber products like boots and tyres etc.), shut down their rubber product production in 1991 after being taken over by the Continental Tyres owned Swedish Gislaved Tyres.

Glava was the main employer by the 2010s, making glass cotton insulation etc.

==History==
Askim has always been a strategic point in wars due to its relative easy crossing of the river. The last battle between Norway and Sweden was fought at the crossing over Glomma on 9 August 1814. There is a yearly historical reenactment, as well as a stone monument at Langnes to commemorate this event.

During the Norwegian Campaign of World War II, a battle occurred at Fossum Bridge when the Norwegian Army defended the crossing against invading Germans in April 1940.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Askim&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Askheimr&quot;), since the first church was built here. The first element is &quot;askr&quot; which means &quot;ash tree&quot; and the last element is &quot;heimr&quot; which means &quot;home&quot;, &quot;homestead&quot;, or &quot;farm&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 1 November 1963. The arms symbolize the three large waterfalls in the municipality, the Solbergfoss, Kykkelsrudfoss, and Vammafoss. The rivers and waterfalls are also partially harnessed for hydroelectric power.

==Transportation==
European route E18 used to go through the city centre, however, since the upgrade to four-lane highway in 2005, its route now runs outside the centre. Vy&#x27;s Eastern Østfold Line serves the municipality with stops at Langnes Station and Næringsparken and Askim Station in between.

==Government==
The municipal council runs the government of Askim. The 2007 election results are as follows:

==Attractions==
* Østfoldbadet 
* Askim videregående skole

<text>Rygge was a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. It was merged into Moss municipality on 1 January 2020. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Rygge. Rygge was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

The emblem of Rygge is the Pasque flower. Rygge is connected to Oslo by double-tracked railway, and four-lane freeway.

Rygge was served by Moss Airport, which has not been operational since 2016.

== General information ==
=== Name ===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Rygge&quot; farm, since the first church was built there. The Old Norse form of the name is not known (the oldest manuscripts from 1353-1528 use the form &quot;Ryg(g)jof&quot;). A possible (but uncertain) reconstruction is &quot;Rýgjuhof&quot;. The first element would then be the genitive case of &quot;rýgja&quot;, a sideform of &quot;rýgr&quot; which means &quot;lady&quot;. (Like &quot;ylgja&quot; to &quot;ylgr&quot;, both forms with the meaning &#x27;she-wolf&#x27;.) The last element is probably &quot;hof&quot; meaning &quot;temple&quot;. If this is correct, then the word &quot;rýgja&quot; most probably is referring to the goddess Freyja, since the meaning of the word &quot;freyja&quot; also is &#x27;lady&#x27;.

An alternative explanation is that the word is derived from &quot;rygg&quot;, which means &quot;ridge&quot;, and related to place names like &quot;Ryen&quot; further east. The &quot;ridge&quot; in question would be the end moraine that runs across the landscape here, from the other side of the fjord and stretching east through Sweden and into the Baltic region. In Østfold, this moraine is referred to as the &quot;Raet&quot;.

=== Coat-of-arms ===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. It was granted on 30 November 1984. The arms show a golden spur on a red background. A spur like this was found in the area that dated back to the Viking Age. It is one of the largest golden items that was ever found in Norway and was thus chosen as a symbol on the arms.

===Rygge Church===
Rygge church (&quot;Rygge kirke&quot;) is a medieval era church located in the village of Kirkegrenda. The church belongs to Vestre Borgesyssel deanery in Diocese of Borg. Rygge church is one of the county&#x27;s better preserved medieval stone churches. It is built around the year 1170. Rygge church was originally a chapter church, which had income from a larger area than a parish and contained several villages. The building is characterized by the use of large stones, partly of granite, but parts of the facade is carved of stone cultivar, including large parts of the north portal. It has a long nave and lower and narrower choir. The church was restored in 1967.
== Military ==
Rygge Air Station replaced a temporary airfield constructed by German forces during World War II. The contemporary airfield, northeast of the highway and main railway, is situated in Rygge and its neighbouring municipality Råde. It was constructed from 1952 to 1954 and until recently it was one of the largest establishments of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The military use of the airfield is now much reduced. A civilian air terminal Moss Airport, Rygge, was opened in early 2008. The airport was closed to all civilian traffic on 1 November 2016 after its main commercial operator, Ryanair, decided to shut down its base there.

<text>Hobøl was a municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Elvestad. Hobøl is situated about southeast of Oslo. The parish of &quot;Haabøl&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

The largest village in Hobøl was Tomter, whose railway station is served by Eastern Østfold Line. Other villages in the municipality were Knapstad, Ringvoll, and the middle part of the municipality which is called Hobøl.

Hobøl was suggested as the replacement site for a new airport to replace Fornebu, and in 1972 the Norwegian parliament voted to build it there. The 1973 oil crisis postponed that plan, and the new airport was finally built at Gardermoen, north of Oslo.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Hobøl&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Hóbœli&quot;), since the first church was built here. The first element is &quot;hór&quot; or &quot;hár&quot; meaning &quot;high&quot;. The last element is &quot;bœli&quot; which means &quot;farm&quot;. Thus the name means &quot;the farm lying on a high ground&quot;. Prior to 1889 the name was written &quot;Haabøl&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The Coat-of-arms is from modern times. It was granted on 30 August 1985; it shows the municipality as seen from above. The municipality is mainly formed by a large valley, cut by the meandering Hobølelva river.

<text>Vestby is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the Follo traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Vestby.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Vestby&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Vestbýr&quot;), since the first church was built here. The first element is &quot;vestr&quot; which means &quot;west&quot; and the last element is &quot;býr&quot; meaning &quot;farm&quot;. The neighbouring farms have the names &quot;Østby&quot; (&quot;eastern farm&quot;), &quot;Sunnby&quot; (&quot;southern farm&quot;), and &quot;Nordby&quot; (&quot;northern farm&quot;); and they must all four be the parts of a bigger and older farm, whose name is now unknown.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 18 June 1982 and designed by Bjørn Linnestad. The arms show three gold bottony crosses on a red background, two over one. They represent the three original parishes in the municipality: Vestby, Garder, and Såner. At the same time they also represent the three natural harbors in the area: Emmerstad, Kjøvangen, and Sonskilen.

==History==
Archaeological research in Hølen has confirmed that the area has been populated since about 2400 BC. There are various archeological finds in the area, such as the ones from the Bronze Age.

Many Norwegian emigrants went to America during the 1840s and later settled in the area of the present city of Westby, Wisconsin (named after general store owner and American Civil War Union soldier Ole T. Westby); a city which still has a mostly Norwegian American population.

Hølen became known for the production of timber. It became a lading place in the 17th century.

From the Renaissance until the 18th century, Son was an important harbour. On some Dutch maps from that time, the Oslofjord is called &quot;Zoon Water&quot;.

Vestby was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The municipality and lading place of Hølen was merged with Vestby on 1 July 1943. The municipality and lading place of Son was merged with Vestby on 1 January 1964. (The lading place of Hvitsten in Vestby has never been a municipality of its own.)

==Geography==
Vestby includes the villages Vestby, Hølen, Hvitsten, Garder, and Son. Recently urbanized areas are Randem, Pepperstad skog, and Sole skog. Randem is located north of the municipal centre, Vestby, and includes an industrial area. Pepperstad is located southwest of Vestby, by the road 155. Sole skog lies west of the centre. The village of Vestby has 5,424 inhabitants (2006). All the small towns together have over 13,000 inhabitants.

<text>Ski () is a town and former municipality in the new municipality (as of January 1, 2020) of Nordre Follo Municipality in the greater region Follo, in Akershus county, Norway.

Ski is the most populous and largest town in Follo, and serves as the de facto municipality center of Nordre Follo. Institutions like the hospital, tingrett (district court), police station, and other regional public services, are located in and around the town of Ski.

==Etymology==
The municipality of Ski inherited its name from the town of Ski, upon being instated as a separate municipality, with the town as its administrative centre. The town of Ski is named after a large farm called Skeidi (Old Norse: &quot;Skeiði&quot;). The word &quot;skeiði&quot; is a side form of &quot;skeið&quot;, meaning &quot;running track for horse racing&quot; - suggesting that there may have been such a track at the farm in medieval times.

Accordingly, and contrary to popular assumption, the name is a reference to horse racing, not skiing.

==History==
Archeological remains from settlements dating as far back as 11,000 years have been found in the Ski and Ås areas. Stone Age tools are still being found when fields are ploughed, and Ski has more than 300 registered ancient historical artifacts.

From the Middle Ages and up to modern times the areas of Kråkstad and Ski were originally administered as medieval church parishes, and each have a medieval stone church from the 1150s. During the 19th century, Kråkstad was the political and administrative centre of the municipality.

On July 1, 1931, the rural, but rapidly growing municipality of Kråkstad was split into two separate municipalities. The village of Ski was chosen as the administrative centre of the northern part, thus giving its name to the new municipality. The village of Kråkstad remained the administrative centre of the southern part, retaining its original name.

By 1964 Ski had developed into a busy town and trading hub for the surrounding, rural areas. Ski municipality had by far outgrown its southern neighbour economically and population-wise. Consequently, on January 1, Kråkstad was officially absorbed into Ski municipality, ceasing to be a municipality of its own. Today, the name &quot;Kråkstad&quot; simply refers to the village, just southeast of the much larger town of Ski.

==Coat of arms==
The current coat of arms was approved on December 19, 1986. It was based on a logo used since 1979. It was designed to reflect the original meaning of the name &quot;Ski&quot; - thus depicting three silver horse heads arranged in a triskelion on a blue background. 

==Geography==
Ski is located in Akershus county, south of Oslo. It borders Oppegård Municipality to the west, Enebakk Municipality to the east, Ås Municipality to the south-west and Hobøl Municipality to the south-east. Ski is an inland municipality and is separated from the Oslofjord by Oppegård and Ås.

The landscape is dominated by rolling hills, covered in forest and farmland interspersed with settlements. In fact, 102.12 of the total of 165.5 square kilometres of land area belonging to the municipality are forest. Apart from the town of Ski, other notable settlements are the villages of Kråkstad and Siggerud, and the larger, sub-urban area of Langhus.

Both major roads leading from Oslo through eastern Norway to Sweden, the E6 and E18, pass through Ski, as well as the main southbound railway line.

==Economy==
Ski is traditionally a rural municipality, and agriculture is still prominent. However, its location at the centre of the district, with Norway&#x27;s two most important main roads intersecting nearby and the main railway line passing through, has made it the commercial and transport hub of the region. This has drawn companies to set up headquarters, factories and logistics hubs in the area, boosting the economy.

Ski town is a regional passenger hub for the national rail service, Vy, and as much of Ski municipality is easily reachable by train or car from central Oslo, the number of people living in Ski and commuting to Oslo has increased rapidly over the last 30 years, and is set to continue increasing - as immigration and birthrates in the Oslo/Akershus region is strong and housing in Oslo proper is of limited availability - and therefore costly.

Ski town has retained its traditional status as a market town and trading hub, and is home to the largest shopping centre in the district and one of the largest in Norway – Ski Storsenter. Ski town is also the political and administrative hub of the Follo region, and the local police headquarter, hospital, and district court - as well as a number of inter-municipal services companies, are located there.

==Ethnicity and foreign minority==

==Geology==
Ski, as most of Follo, lies on ancient rock foundations. Throughout the local area from east to west there is a moraine left from the Ice age.

==Sports==
There are numerous sports clubs in Ski municipality, covering a wide range of sports. Most are junior or amateur sports clubs. The best known sports team is the football team Follo FK, which is based in Ski town. Follo FK is a joint effort by a number of local sports clubs in the Follo district, in order to be able to field a national-level football team. Follo FK currently (2016) plays in the 2nd division of the national football league, having played both in the 1st division and in the 3rd division previously, and have played in the national cup finals twice.

<doc id="177972" wikidata="Q54062" url="?curid=177972" title="Ås, Akershus">
<text>Ås is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the Follo traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ås. The parish of &quot;Aas&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Ås is one of the fastest-growing municipalities in Akershus, with a population of 20,652 in 2020, and an increase of 539 in 2008. Ås is the largest agricultural municipality of Akershus, and home to the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and the amusement park Tusenfryd.

==General information==

===Etymology===
The parish was named after the old &quot;Ås&quot; (Norse &quot;Áss&quot;) farm, since the first church was built there. The name is identical with the word &quot;áss&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;ridge&quot; or &quot;esker&quot; (height in moraine landscape). Prior to 1921, the name was spelled &quot;Aas&quot;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 23 July 1982. The three silver diamonds are a symbol for the many archaeological findings in the area. The diamond (rhombus) shape was taken as it resembled many of the axes found in the area &quot;(Nøstvet ax)&quot;. The silver colour resembles the flint, which the tools were made of. The number of three diamonds was chosen to represent the three parishes in the municipality: Ås, Kroer and Nordby.

==Economy==
The most important source of income is agriculture. Ås is the largest agricultural municipality of Akershus: providing the region with grain, vegetables, and dairy products. Of the of land in the municipality, about are farmed and about are forested.

== The park at NMBU ==
The park at Norwegian University of Life Sciences is one of the largest and most completed neoclassical parka facilities in Norway. The park today appears as a result of the docent Olav L. Moen&#x27;s plans from around 1924. The park is located at highway 152 towards Drøbak, about 1 kilometre west of Ås town centre. The entire park area is about 600 acres and is used for recreation and teaching. The park contains 800 different types of shrubs and trees, a teaching field with just over 200 perennial species and a rosarium founded in 1965. The plant species are collected family and family. Most of the plants are labelled so that it is possible for plant enthusiasts to orient themselves in the plant collection. The park is an integral part of NMBU.

== Leonardo da Vinci Bridge ==

In Nygårdskrysset in Ås municipality over The European route E18 lies the 108-metre-long Leonardo Da Vinci project which is a project by the painter and artist Vebjørn Sandas part of his Da Vinci project. Vebjørn Sand saw the drawings of the bridge for the first time in 1985. Later in 1995 he saw a model of the bridge on display in Stockholm, and got the idea to build the bridge in full size.

The bridge was opened in October 2001. The bridge has received solid media coverage in Norway and in the rest of the world. In the United States, the bridge has been featured in CNN, Washington Post, The New York Times and Time Magazine. Leonardo da Vinci presented a miniature model of the bridge in 1502 that was originally designed by the Turkish sultan Bayezid II and intended to cross the Golden Horn at the Bosporos-Strait. The bridge was originally supposed to be 240 metres long.

==Climate==
==Transportation==
Ås Station is a train station served by the line R21 of the Oslo Commuter Rail, operated by the Vy. Two of Norway&#x27;s largest highways, European route E6 and European route E18, run through the municipality, and many of the inhabitants commute to Oslo.
A bridge, which is a smaller-scale recreation of a bridge that Leonardo da Vinci proposed in 1502 for the crossing of the Golden Horn, is located in the municipality. It was created by Norwegian painter and artist Vebjørn Sand as part of his Da Vinci project. The bridge serves as a pedestrian crossing over European route E18.

==Population==
As of 1 January 2020, Ås municipality covers and has 20,652 inhabitants. In 2007, the Ås urban area had a population of 8,095. The municipality also contains one additional urban area, Togrenda, with a population of 2,783. Also, 1,566 inhabitants live in the Ski urban area.

<text>Frogn is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the Follo traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Drøbak. Frogn was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The city of Drøbak was merged with Frogn on 1 January 1962.

Frogn is located at the southern part of the peninsula between the main Oslofjord and Bunnefjorden. It borders Nesodden, Ås and Vestby.

== General information ==

=== Name ===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Frogn&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Fraun&quot;), since the first church was built here. The name must be very old and the meaning is unknown. One theory is that it is derived from the Norse word &quot;frauð&quot; which means &quot;manure&quot; and the meaning would then be &quot;the fertilized field&quot; (see also Frogner and Tøyen).

Prior to 1889, the name was written &quot;Fron&quot;. Between 1837 and 1865, the name of the municipality was &quot;Drøbak landdistrikt&quot;.

=== Coat-of-arms ===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 20 May 1988. The arms symbolize the Oscarsborg Fortress in silver on a blue background. The fortress is on the Drøbaksund in the Oslofjord in the municipality. The fortress was built in the late 19th century and played a major role in the defence of Norway in the beginning of World War II.

<text>Nesodden is a municipality in Akershus in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the Greater Oslo Region and many residents of the peninsula Nesodden commute to work in Oslo. 

It is part of the traditional region of Follo. The administrative centre of the municipality is Nesoddtangen. The parish of &quot;Næsodden&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt.

== General information ==

=== Name ===
The name (Old Norse: &quot;Nesoddi&quot;) is an old district name. The first element is &quot;nes&quot; which means &quot;headland&quot; and the last element is (the definite form of) &quot;odde&quot; which means &quot;point&quot;.

The very tip of the peninsula is called Nesoddtangen, where the last element is (the definite form of) &quot;tange&quot; which means &quot;spit&quot;. In fact, all three elements in this name have (nearly) the same meaning, so it can be translated roughly as peninsula-peninsula-peninsula.

===Nesodden Church===

Nesodden Church (&quot;Nesodden kirke&quot;) is located in Nesodden parish in Follo rural deanery. The Medieval, Romanesque church is situated southeast of the village of Nesodden. The building material is stone and brick. It was built in 1175. It has a rectangular nave and lower, narrower choir. The church is of long plan and has 130 seats. In the church, there is a Renaissance pulpit from about 1600 decorated with paintings of Jesus and the four Evangelists. The altarpiece from 1715 was carved by Johan Jørgen Schram with a motif showing Jesus in Gethsemane. Domenico Erdmann conducted restoration during 1920. The baptismal font made in clay stone and dates from the Middle Ages.

The church was renovated several times between the 17th and the 20th centuries. The chancel was extended in 1714. The church was most recently restored between 1956 and 1960, both times under the direction of architect Ragnar Nilsen (1896–1986). The church celebrated its 800th anniversary during 1975.

===Sunnaas Hospital===
Sunnaas Hospital, founded in 1954 as a nursing home, was authorized as a hospital in 1960, primarily to treat polio patients from Oslo in cooperation with Oslo City Hospital. The hospital is a university hospital today.

==Minorities==
== Geography ==
Nesodden is located on the tip of the peninsula between main Oslofjord and its arm Bunnefjorden. It includes the villages Hellvik, Fjellstrand, Bjørnemyr, Nesoddtangen, and Fagerstrand, which is also the name of a reality show that was filmed on Fagerstrand and aired on TV 2 during the first half of 2005.

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms is designed by the architect Christian Doxrud (1917–2002) and authorized 12 December 1986. The coat of arms shows a silver triangle on a blue background as a canting of the geographical position of the municipality, which is situated on a peninsula in the Oslofjord.

== The Nesodden Ferries ==
Most Nesodden residents rely on a 5 km ferry connection from Nesoddtangen to access Oslo, as the distance by road is 45 km. Nesoddtangen has passenger ferry connections to Lysaker in Bærum (8 min) and Aker Brygge in Oslo (23 min).

<text>Oppegård is an area in Nordre Follo, Akershus, Norway. Oppegård was a municipality in the county Akershus.

It is part of the traditional region of Follo. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Kolbotn. The municipality of Oppegård was separated from the municipality of Nesodden on 1 July 1915. Oppegård municipality had an area of , hence it was the smallest municipality in Akershus by area.

On 1 January 2020, Oppegård municipality was merged with Ski into the new Nordre Follo municipality.

Within Oppegård, there is an eponymous village.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Oppegård&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Uppigarðr&quot;), since the first church was built here. The first element is &quot;uppi&quot; which means &quot;upper&quot; and the last element is &quot;garðr&quot; which means &quot;farm&quot;. (The farm is probably a part of an older and bigger farm.)

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms were granted on 6 August 1976. The arms show 17 gold triangles on a black background. The 17 triangles symbolize 17 trees, which again symbolize the 17 old farms in the municipality. Most of the farms lie in an area called Svartskog (&#x27;black forest&#x27;), so the arms are canting arms.

== History ==
Oppegård has been populated since the end of the last ice age. Archeological remains of hunter-gatherer societies dating back to 5000–6000 BCE have been found, as well as the remains of agricultural settlements from 1000 to 2000 BCE. The main southern roads connecting Oslo to Sweden and Denmark have passed through Oppegård since the Iron Age.

19 farms from the Middle Ages, have been counted.

The former municipality was created from the eastern part of the municipality of Nesodden in 1915. At the time, the population of Oppegård was only 600. The 1960s and 1970s saw a population boom, as larger housing projects established the Oppegård villages as suburbs of Oslo. The commercial centres along the main railroad axis is examples of the functionalist architecture characteristic of that period of urbanization in Scandinavia.

Arctic explorer Roald Amundsen lived in Svartskog and his house is now a museum, administered by the municipality. Svartskog is also home to a medieval stone church, and is likely the oldest settlement in Oppegård.

==Politics==
Since 1968, coinciding with the population boom, the Conservative Party of Norway &quot;(Høyre)&quot; has held either a majority or plurality of representatives in the municipal council. Several leading politicians for Høyre began their political careers as mayors of Oppegård, including Rolf Presthus (mayor from 1968 to 1970, Conservative Party Leader and Minister of Finance) and Jan Petersen (mayor from 1975 to 1981, Conservative Party Leader and Minister of Foreign Affairs). Oppegård is demographically an urban middle class area, demographically similar to Bærum and Asker and a traditional stronghold for Høyre.

Former Prime Minister and leader of the Christian Democratic Party Kjell Magne Bondevik lives in Oppegård.

==Geography==
Oppegård is located at the eastern coast of Bunnefjorden (originally called &quot;Foli&quot;, like the Årungen lake to the south), which is an arm of Oslofjord. It includes the villages Oppegård, Svartskog, and Kolbotn. The landscape is dominated by a vast part of the north–south oriented lake Gjersjøen, which roughly divides the district into western and eastern sections. The lake Kolbotnvannet is located here as well. The undeveloped areas are largely covered by forest.

Oppegård is a largely residential suburb of Oslo, but also a business hub. It hosts the Norwegian headquarters of several larger corporations (including Kodak and IBM) within its borders. Tax revenues from large corporations made Oppegård one of Norway&#x27;s richest municipalities in the 1980s and 1990s. These revenues, and the wealth they brought, were lost in the 2000s when corporations were made to pay taxes directly to the national government, rather than the local government.

Commuter trains connect Oppegård to Oslo, and makes the neighbourhoods close to the train stations (Rosenholm, Kolbotn, Solbråtan, Myrvoll, Greverud, and Oppegård) popular residential areas.

<text>Soyuz 2 (, Union 2) was an uncrewed spacecraft (capsule number 7K-OK-P No. 11) in the Soyuz family, intended to be the target of a docking maneuver by the crewed Soyuz 3 spacecraft. It was intended to be the first docking of a crewed spacecraft in the Soviet space program. Although the two craft approached closely, the docking did not take place and the first successful Soviet docking of crewed spacecraft took place in the joint Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 mission. It served for the radio search and as a target vehicle for docking by the crewed Soyuz 3. Soyuz 2 soft-landed in a predetermined area of the Soviet Union, near the village of Maiburnak, southwest of the city of Karaganda. 

== Mission parameters ==

* Perigee: 
* Apogee: 
* Inclination: 51.65°
* Period: 88.50 minutes

== &quot;Crew&quot; hoax ==
Conceptual artist Joan Fontcuberta claimed in 1997 that Soyuz 2 was crewed by Ivan Istochnikov and a dog named Kloka, who disappeared on 26 October 1968, with signs of having been hit by a meteorite. According to Fontcuberta, Soviet officials deleted Istochnikov from official Soviet history to avoid embarrassment; however, the &quot;Sputnik Foundation&quot; discovered Istochnikov&#x27;s &quot;voice transcriptions, videos, original annotations, some of his personal effects, and photographs taken throughout his lifetime&quot;. The exhibition of artifacts (e.g., photographs) related to &quot;Soyuz 2&quot; was shown in many countries, including Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Japan, and the United States. Among other reactions to the exhibition, a Russian ambassador &quot;got extremely angry because [Fontcuberta] was insulting the glorious Russian past and threatened to present a diplomatic complaint&quot;.

Several lines of evidence available since the first exhibition of &quot;Sputnik&quot; in 1997 in Madrid suggested that the story and artifacts form an elaborate hoax:

* The name &quot;Ivan Istochnikov&quot; is a Russian translation of Joan Fontcuberta&#x27;s name; in specific, &quot;Joan&quot; and &quot;Ivan&quot; both translate to &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Fontcuberta&quot; and &quot;Istochnikov&quot; both mean &quot;hidden fountain&quot;.
* The photographs of Istochnikov show Fontcuberta&#x27;s face.
* Pages of the official website of the Madrid exhibition contain the words &quot;PURE FICTION&quot; toward the top of each page in light red text on a dark red background or light pink text on a white background.
* The front and rear endpapers of the catalog accompanying the Madrid exhibition have the words &quot;it&#x27;s all fiction&quot; in Russian and Spanish printed on them using glow-in-the-dark ink.
* At the website of Spanish newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;, the third of three pages concerning the Madrid exhibition states that &quot;the report which we published on the previous pages is a product of his [Fontcuberta&#x27;s] imagination&quot;.

<text>Asker (), also called Asker proper (&quot;Askerbygda&quot; or &quot;gamle Asker&quot; in Norwegian), is a district and former municipality in Akershus, Norway, located approximately 20km southwest of Oslo. From 2020 it is part of the larger administrative municipality Asker (also known as Greater Asker) together with the traditional Buskerud districts Røyken and Hurum; Asker constitutes the northern fourth and is part of the Greater Oslo Region. The administrative center was the town of Asker, which remains so for the new larger municipality. Asker was established as a parish in the Middle Ages and as a municipality on 1 January 1838.

==History==

Since the Middle Ages, the Asker parish consisted of the later municipalities Asker and Bærum. In the 19th century, Bærum became the Vestre Bærum and Østre Bærum parish and Asker and Bærum were also established as separate municipalities.

In 2020, Asker merged with Røyken and Hurum to form Asker Municipality, a larger administrative region than traditional/geographical Asker. The newly-formed Asker Municipality was made part of Viken County immediately following the 2020 merge. However, Viken dissolved on 1 January 2024, returning Asker (with the addition of Røyken and Hurum) to the county of Akershus.

== Name ==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Asker&quot; farm since the first church was built here. The name (Old Norse: &quot;Askar&quot;) is the plural form of &quot;ask&quot; which means &quot;ash tree&quot;.

== Coat-of-arms ==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 7 October 1975. The arms show a green background with three silver-colored tree trunks () and are thus canting arms. The trees are ashes, which were cropped every year to provide food for the animals. The trees thus developed after many years a very typical shape, which was characteristic for the area.

== Place of the Millennium ==
In 1998, just before the millennium, the &#x27;Askerbøringer&#x27; (the inhabitants of Asker) elected the beautiful area of Semsvannet including the mountain ridge Skaugumsåsen – to be their Place of the Millennium.

== Geography ==
Its main parts are Asker, Gullhella, Vollen, Vettre, Blakstad, Bleiker, Borgen, Drengsrud, Dikemark, Vardåsen, Engelsrud, Holmen, Høn, Hvalstad, Billingstad, Nesøya, Nesbru, and Heggedal. Asker is a coastal place with many beaches, but also contains hills and woods. The district is known for many important businesses. It is also known for gardening. The Skaugum estate, where Crown Prince Haakon of Norway lives with his family, is situated here. The first IKEA store outside of Sweden opened at Slependen in Asker in 1963. There are many hiking/ sightseeing spots around Asker; such as Semsvannet lake and Drengsrud cultural path around the area.

==Municipality reform==
As part of the municipality reform process instigated by Minister of Local Government Jan Tore Sanner the municipalities of Asker, Hurum, and Røyken evaluated if they should merge into a new common municipality during the first half of 2016. A tentative agreement was reached and on 16 June 2016 the Municipal Council of Røyken approved the merger with Asker and Hurum with 24 votes for and 3 against. On 14 June 2016 the Municipal Council of Asker also approved the merger with 42 votes for and 5 against. A few days later the Municipal Council of Hurum followed suit and approved the merger. The proposed merger date was 1 January 2020 and the new name will be Asker. Asker was merged with the municipalities of Røyken and Hurum as of 1 January 2020.

== Minorities ==
== Culture ==
Although Asker is principally a rural municipality, the expansion of Oslo has resulted in its becoming an affluent suburb. Thus numerous celebrities now reside in the area. According to SSB (Statistics Norway), Asker ranks as the 2nd wealthiest municipality in Norway based on median household income.

=== Sports ===
Asker is also the home of the sports club IF Frisk Asker; the club won the Norwegian Hockey championship in 1975, 1979, 2002, and 2019. Asker Skiklubb is the largest sports club in Norway. It has a long history dating back to 1889. Many of Asker&#x27;s famous people have been successful individuals associated with the sports club.

The city is the home of Asker svømmeklubb. Asker women&#x27;s football club has been home to many international players including four who played in the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in China.

=== Politics ===
Asker is politically dominated by the conservatives, and the mayor is Lene Conradi who represents the Conservative Party of Norway &quot;(Høyre)&quot;.

===Church===

Asker Church (&quot;Asker Kirke&quot;) is located not far from Skaugum in Asker. The neo-Gothic red brick church was built in 1879 based upon designs by architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan. The church renovation in 1930 was led by the architects Gudolf Blakstad and Herman Munthe-Kaas. Architect Arnstein Arneberg was in charge of the renovation in the 1950s. The church was the sight of the wedding of Princess Ragnhild and Erling Lorentzen in 1953. The statue of Crown Princess Märtha in front of the church was designed by sculptor Dyre Vaa in 1957.

== &quot;Maud&quot; ==
In 1916 (or 1917) the Arctic expedition ship &quot;Maud&quot; was built in nearby Vollen and launched into Oslofjord. The ship was designed and built especially for Roald Amundsen and sailed through the Northeast Passage between 1918 and 1924. Sold to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company as the supply vessel &quot;Baymaud&quot; she sank at Cambridge Bay, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), Canada in 1930. In 1990, the ship was sold by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to Asker town with the expectation that she would be returned there; however, the export permit expired due to the 230 million kroner () cost to repair and move the ship. In 2011 a new project was commenced to salvage &quot;Maud&quot; and transport her to a new museum to be built at Vollen.

On 31 July 2016 it was reported that the hull of &quot;Maud&quot; had been raised to the surface and placed on a barge in preparation for shipment to Norway. In August 2017 &quot;Maud&quot; began the journey back to Norway; she was towed through the Northwest Passage. In September 2017 she arrived in Greenland to stay for the winter. &quot;Maud&quot; arrived in Bergen on 6 August 2018, finally returning to Norway nearly a century after her departure with Amundsen. She was then towed along the Norwegian coast, and arrived at Vollen on 18 August.

<text>Fet was a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It was part of the Romerike traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Fetsund.

Fet was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The new municipality of Rælingen was separated from Fet on 1 July 1929. The part of Enebakk municipality lying east of lake Øyeren was transferred to Fet in 1962. On 1 January 2020 Fet was merged with Skedsmo and Sørum municipalities to form Lillestrøm municipality.

==General information==
===Name===
The name (Old Norse: &quot;Fit&quot;) was first recorded in 1321 (&quot;a Fit&quot;). The word &quot;fit&quot; means &#x27;vigorous meadow&#x27;.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 19 December 1986. The arms show a logging hook, which was used in the area to haul the logs cut in the surrounding forests. The logs were transported over the streams and lakes to the sawmills. The people used long poles with hooks to haul the logs. The colours of the arms are green and silver because the name is derived from an old word describing a field (green) near a lake (silver).

==Geography==

Fet is located on the eastern side of Lake Øyeren and includes the point at which the River Glomma enters the lake. The inland river delta that has formed is the largest in Europe and reaches the opposite shore of the lake, across its short axis. Until 1985, logs floated down the river were brought onshore here before the river entered its delta, and were then transported onwards by rail. Today, many of Fet&#x27;s floating buildings have been preserved and converted into a museum and cultural centre.

<text>Enebakk is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the Follo traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Kirkebygda. 
The parish of &quot;Enebak&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The part of Enebakk lying east of lake Øyeren was transferred to Fet municipality in 1962.

==General information==
===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Enebakk&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Ignarbakki&quot;), since the first church was built here. The first element is the genitive case of a river name &quot;Ign&quot; (the meaning is unknown) and the last element is &quot;bakki&quot; which means &quot;river bank&quot;. In Norse times the parish was alternatively called &quot;Ignardalr&quot; meaning &quot;the valley of (the river) Ign&quot;. Prior to 1921, the name was written &quot;Enebak&quot;.
==Enebakk Church==
Enebakk Church (&quot;Enebakk kirke&quot;) dated from 11th-12th century. It is constructed in a rectangular shape. The edifice is of stone and has 280 seats. The present church has since been expanded and undergone major restorations, the latest in 2010. Enebakk church is a medieval era church, with a rectangular nave and finished choir. Portals and corners are quarried sandstone, while the church was constructed by the macadam. The nave and chancel were built in the 1100s, while the west tower was built during the 1200s. The tower was originally higher than now, but was rebuilt around 1520. The ridge turret of the tower roof was built in 1622, and is thus the oldest preserved wooden tower in the country.

The frescoes in the nave were uncovered in the 1960s. They were originally painted in the late 1500s and covered all the walls, but were later painted over after the Reformation. The decoration is done in Renaissance style. In 1608 the church received a new altar with catechism boards, which are an altarpiece without pictures, just text. The altarpiece was later elevated to a picture field showing the Crucifixion. This was done in the 1660s. The baptismal font from the 1100s is of soapstone with Romanesque decoration. The church has two wooden sculptures: a crucifix hanging above the chancel arch and a Madonna both in Gothic style.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 12 December 1986. The arms are based on a drawing in the local church that dates back to the early 17th century. They show four silver crosses on a green background. It is inspired by old mural paintings in the Enebakk church from the Middle Ages. It shows four fourblades. The number four symbolizes the four parts of the municipality (see below).

==Media==
The newspaper &quot;Enebakk Avis&quot; is published in Enebakk.

==Geography==
Enebakk is divided into four areas, named Flateby (Postcode 1911), Kirkebygda (Postcode 1912), and Ytre Enebakk (Postcode 1914), being closest to Oslo.

The highest point in Enebakk is Vardåsen, situated between the lakes Børtervann and Øyeren, at above sea level.

Enebakk is a mere from the city limits of Oslo, with easy bus-access to the country&#x27;s capital. As of 2004, there are no train stations in the municipality.

== Notable people ==
* Thomas Alsgaard (1972 in Enebakk) a Norwegian cross-country skier 
* Thorleif Andresen (born 1945 in Enebakk) cyclist, competed at the 1968, 1972 and the 1976 Summer Olympics

==General information==

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old (and no longer existent) &quot;Leirheimr&quot; farm. The first element is &quot;leirr&quot; which means &quot;clay&quot; and the last element is &quot;heimr&quot; which means &quot;homestead&quot; or &quot;farm&quot;. Thus: &quot;the farm built on clay ground&quot;. The suffix &quot;skógr&quot; (meaning &quot;wood&quot;) was added later, changing the meaning to &quot;the woodlands around the farm &quot;Leirheimr&quot;&quot;. Prior to 1918, the name was spelled &quot;Lørenskogen&quot;.

===Heraldry===
Lørenskog&#x27;s arms date from modern times. Granted on 26 July 1957, they show a red waterwheel on a gold background. Water-driven sawmills were once an important part of the municipality&#x27;s economy.

==Lørenskog Church==
Lørenskog Church (&quot;Lørenskog kirke&quot;) is a medieval era church. The building material was brick and quarried limestone. The church dates to ca. 1150. The church is of rectangular plan and has 140 seats. In 1608 the church received a pulpit. The west tower was made of wood and was erected in 1864. In the tower hangs two church bells, the larger made in 1874. Its walls are one meter thick, and the stones are held together with lime mortar. The exterior and interior plaster was repaired during the 1600s and 1700s. In 1956 old plaster was removed and walls re-plastered and painted. The current outward opening door was inserted in 1946.

==Minorities==
==Geography==
The municipality is located just east of the capital, Oslo, with many main roads going through it. Almost all the inhabitants live in the northern part of Lørenskog. The southern parts consist of forest, while farms and grain fields occupy the space in between.
An important train station, Lørenskog Station, is situated in the district. Within Lørenskog, Losby is known for its waterwheel, which is represented in the municipal coat-of-arms of Lørenskog. Losby Golf and Country Club is located within the municipality.

==Village==
From 2006 to 2008, workers renovated the village of Lørenskog (the administrative center of the municipality), also called the &quot;Metro Senter&quot;. This renovation includes a considerably larger shopping mall, a bus terminal with buses going in and out of Oslo every 15 minutes, possibly a future subway station, and the new Mailand Upper Secondary School.

==Economy==
The headquarters of Power, a consumer electronics company, are located at Lørenskog.

They represent the main transportation lines that run through the municipality from Oslo to other parts of the country: the main highway and the railroad, they also can represent skiing tracks, an old winter transportation method. At the same time the two lines symbolize matches, as one of Norway&#x27;s oldest match factories was founded in Nittedal. The lines also symbolize tree logs, as forestry is of great importance for the local economy.

<text>Gjerdrum () is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike.

Gjerdrum borders the municipalities of Nannestad, Nittedal, and Ullensaker, and Lillestrøm. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Ask.

==Name and coat of arms==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Gjerdrum farm (Norse &quot;Gerðarvin&quot;). The first element is the genitive of a river name &quot;Gerð&quot; and the last element is &quot;vin&quot; &#x27;meadow, pasture&#x27;. The river name is derived from the Norse word &quot;garðr&quot; meaning &#x27;fence&#x27; and so the meaning is &#x27;the river whose function is a fence (or as a border)&#x27;.

The coat of arms is from modern times. They were granted in 1993. The arms show a traditional Norwegian form of roundpole fence. The arms are also canting because the name of the municipality refers to a fence.

==History==
Gjerdrum was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

Store norske leksikon says that artefacts indicate that humans have lived in Gjerdrum since ancient times; furthermore the names of places also indicate the same.

===2020 landslide===

On 30 December 2020 a quick clay landslide occurred in the village of Ask within Gjerdum municipality. 10 people died. The slide measured , injured 10 people (including one seriously), left 10 unaccounted for and led to 1,000 being evacuated from the village, with several homes having been destroyed in the slide.

==Geography==

Gjerdrum lies on the southwestern part of the Romerike Plain (&quot;Romerikssletta&quot;); this eastern part of the municipality lies at a low altitude and is covered by significant layers of clay that was deposited, towards the end of the previous ice age.

The quick-clay at Gjerdrum was deposited (in a fjord) around 8,000 or 9,000 years ago, when the sea level was around 200 meters higher.

==Demographics==

In 2021, 1258 inhabitants were immigrants or Norwegian-born to immigrant parents. 264 inhabitants had Polish parents or were Polish themselves; 173 had Lithuanian parents or were Lithuanian.

==Sports==
The local sports team is Gjerdrum IL.

== People from Gjerdrum ==

* Christian Krohg (1777–1828) politician, cabinet member, MP
* Olaf Devik (1886 in Gjerdrum – 1987) meteorologist and physicist 
* Daniel Franck (born 1974) a snowboarder, silver medallist in the men&#x27;s halfpipe in the 1998 Winter Olympics

<text>Ullensaker is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Jessheim. It has a population of 40,459 inhabitants. Norway&#x27;s largest international airport Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, is located in Ullensaker.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Ullensaker&quot; farm. The name is first recorded in 1300 as &quot;Ullinshof&quot;. 
The first element is the genitive case of the name &quot;Ullinn&quot; (a sideform of &quot;Ullr&quot;). The last element was originally &quot;hof&quot; which means &quot;temple&quot;, but this was later (around 1500 AD) changed to &quot;aker&quot; meaning &quot;acre&quot; or &quot;field&quot;.

==Coat-of-arms==

Ullensaker does not have an heraldic coat-of-arms properly granted. The municipality uses a non-heraldic badge that is from modern times. The logo was adopted on 8 November 1979, and it shows the god Ullr of Norse mythology holding a bow and three arrows. The colors on the logo can vary.

==Geography==
Ullensaker borders with Eidsvoll to the north, Nes to the east, Sørum to the south, and Gjerdrum and Nannestad to the west.
The international airport that serves as the main airport of Norway, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, is located in Ullensaker. The municipality has two major population centres: the village of Kløfta and the city of Jessheim, the latter one houses the administration center of Ullensaker. There is also a Royal Norwegian Army base at Sessvollmoen as well as a Royal Norwegian Air Force air station, Gardermoen Air Station.

==Society==
Ullensaker has had a huge population increase over the past fifty years. This increase has been slightly accelerating over the past few years. From 2000 to 2007, the population of Ullensaker increased by almost 6,000 people. The recent increase is partly attributed to the founding of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.

<text>Nes is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the traditional region of Romerike. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Årnes.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Nes&quot; farm (Old Norse: &quot;Nes&quot; which means &quot;headland&quot;), since the first church was built here. The actual &quot;nes&quot; is the headland made by the two great rivers Glomma and Vorma, which have their meeting point just south of the farm. Prior to 1889, the name was spelled &quot;Næs&quot;.

==Coat-of-arms==
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted in 1988. The arms show three yellow logs (to represent forestry) on a green background (to symbolize youth and hope). The position of the logs represents the meeting of the rivers Glomma and Vorma, creating the headland of Nes. 

==History==
The parish of &quot;Næs&quot; was established as a municipality of its own on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt).

==Nes Church Ruins==
Nes Church ruins (&quot;Nes kirkeruin&quot;) are one of Norway&#x27;s best preserved church ruins. The church which dated from ca 1100 was designed in Romanesque style and was extended into a cruciform church in 1697. The old medieval stone was located near the juncture of two rivers; Glomma and Vorma. The church suffered fire damage in 1854. After the fire the walls were preserved as ruins. The new Nes Church was completed in 1860.

==Geography==
The municipality borders Eidsvoll, Ullensaker, Sørum, and Aurskog-Høland in Akershus county and Eidskog, Sør-Odal, and Nord-Odal in Hedmark county.

Nes includes many natural attractions, such as parts of the river Glomma, as well as 168 lakes. Elk, beaver, wolf, and lynx can be found here. Hunting and sportfishing are very prevalent.

Eight hundred farms make the area one of the largest producers of wheat in the country.

<text>Eidsvoll (; sometimes written as &quot;Eidsvold&quot;) is a municipality in Akershus county, Norway. It is part of the Romerike traditional region. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Sundet.

==General information==

===Etymology===
The first element is the genitive case of the word &quot;eid&quot; (Old Norse: &quot;eið&quot;) and the last element is &quot;voll&quot; (Old Norse: &quot;vǫllr&quot;) which means &quot;meadow&quot; or &quot;field&quot;. The meaning of the word &quot;eid&quot; in this case is &quot;a road passing around a waterfall&quot;. People from the districts around the lake (Mjøsa) who were sailing down the river Vorma, and people from Romerike sailing up the same river, both had to enter this area by passing the Sundfossen waterfall. Because of this, the site became an important meeting place long before the introduction of Christianity. Prior to 1918, the name was spelled &quot;Eidsvold&quot;. The town of Eidsvold in Queensland, Australia and Eidsvold Township, Lyon County, Minnesota, United States still use this old spelling.
===Eidsvoll Church=== 
Eidsvoll Church (&quot;Eidsvoll Kirke&quot;) is a cruciform church from approx 1200. It is part of the Norwegian Church and belongs to Øvre Romerike deanery in the Diocese of Borg. The Romanesque building is in stone. Eidsvoll church is repeatedly burned and rebuilt. The old church records were lost in a fire. The altarpiece in Eidsvoll church is from 1765. It is a wooden structure with three floors, decreasing towards the top, where each floor concludes with gilded pilasters with capitals and rococo decor on each side of a painting. The altarpiece was restored after a fire in 1883, the next restoration occurred in 1915 and a third restoration occurred late 1960s. Access to the church is a well traveled tourist destination is via Rv181 and Fv502 / Rv177. Pilegrimsleden goes through Eidsvoll. Eidsvoll church is one of the more prominent stops along the path, which was officially opened on 16 June 2002.

===Coat-of-arms===
The coat-of-arms is from modern times. They were granted on 20 November 1987. The arms show a balance as a symbol of justice. In the early Middle Ages a local court was established in Eidsvoll.


==History==
The parish of &quot;Eidsvold&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The municipality of Feiring was merged with Eidsvoll on 1 January 1964.

Eidsvoll is mentioned in Old Norse manuscripts. In the 11th century, it became the site of court and assembly (&quot;ting&quot;) for eastern parts of Norway, replacing Vang, now a part of Hamar in Hedmark. Because of its access to the river Vorma and the lake Mjøsa, Eidsvoll has long provided a thoroughfare to northern parts of inland Norway. Historically the main industry of Eidsvoll was agriculture, though the soil is rich in clay. Eastern parts of Eidsvoll were for a short time the site of a minor gold rush when gold was found in 1758, and these areas are still known as &quot;Gullverket&quot;.

Eidsvoll Verk was opened to smelt iron ore by King Christian IV of Denmark in 1624, relying on the excellent water power from the Andelva river. In 1688, it was owned by the director of the Kongsberg Silver Mines, &quot;Schlanbusch&quot;, and remained in his family until 1781. Carsten Anker came into possession of works in 1794, at which time it was in decay since many of the surrounding forests required for charcoal had been depleted. He restored it and set up the production of stoves and similar iron goods. He also took residence in Eidsvoll in 1811, rebuilding the manor house which is now the Eidsvollsbygningen, the site where the constitutional assembly met to draft and sign the Constitution of Norway on 17 May 1814. Eidsvollsbygningen is today a famous museum.

In 1854, Eidsvoll became the end point for the first railroad line in Norway from Oslo. This became the transit point for travel with the steamship Skibladner to Hamar, Gjøvik, and Lillehammer on the lake Mjøsa. In addition to the historic Eidsvoll Church, Eidsvoll is the site of the Langset Church (&quot;Langset kirke&quot;) which dates to 1859 and the Feiring Church (&quot;Feiring Kirke&quot;) which dates to 1875.

<doc id="177995" wikidata="Q308120" url="?curid=177995" title="Ølen">
<text>Ølen is a former municipality in the Vestlandet region of Norway. The municipality existed from 1916 until 2006, and originally it was a part of Hordaland county, but in 2002 it was transferred to Rogaland county prior to its dissolution in 2006. The municipality was located on the south side of the Bjoafjorden and east of the Ålfjorden. The administrative center of Ølen was the village of Ølensjøen. The municipality of Ølen makes up the northern part of the present-day Vindafjord Municipality in Rogaland county.

==History==

The parish of Ølen was established as a municipality on 1 July 1916 when it was split off from the large municipality of Fjelberg. Initially, Ølen had 1,715 residents. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the neighboring municipality of Vikebygd was dissolved and the eastern half of it (population: 578) was merged into the municipality of Ølen.

On 1 January 2002, the municipality of Ølen was transferred administratively from Hordaland county to Rogaland county. On 1 January 2003, the people of Ølen and the neighboring municipality of Vindafjord held a merger referendum which was successful. On 1 January 2006, Ølen and Vindafjord merged, forming a larger municipality called Vindafjord. Before the merger, Ølen had a population of 3,426. The coat of arms of the new Vindafjord municipality bears the design of the old Ølen arms and the colours of the old Vindafjord arms.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Ølsfjorden () since it was a central geographical feature of the municipality. The meaning of the name is uncertain, but it may come from the word which means &quot;to produce&quot; or &quot;to nourish&quot;, possibly referring to the rich fishing in the fjord.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 4 April 1986. The official blazon is &quot;Gyronny embowed argent and vert&quot; (). This means the arms are a whirl design that divides the shield into 8 curved sections. The field (background) alternates colors, with half having a tincture of green and the other half have a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The design was chosen to symbolise the way that several major roads come together in the municipality, making it an important centre of trade. The arms were designed by Vigdis Viland. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

==Government==
While it existed, this municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. During its existence, this municipality was governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor was indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality was under the jurisdiction of the Gulating Court of Appeal.

===Mayors===

The mayors () of Ølen (incomplete list):
*1999-2005: Arne Bergsvåg (Sp)

===Municipal council===
The municipal council of Ølen was made up of 21 representatives that were elected to four-year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council of Ølen was as follows:

<text>Vardø (; ; ; ) is a municipality in Finnmark county in the extreme northeastern part of Norway. Vardø is the easternmost town in Norway, more to the east than Saint Petersburg or Istanbul. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Vardø. Two of the larger villages in the municipality are Kiberg and Svartnes.

The municipality is the 188th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Vardø is the 284th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 1,972. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 6.9% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The town of Vardø and the rural district around it was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The law required that all towns be separated from their rural districts, but because of a low population and very few voters, this was impossible to carry out for Vardø in 1838. (This also happened to the nearby towns of Hammerfest and Vadsø.) The rural district of Vardø (&quot;Vardø landdistrikt&quot;, which was renamed Båtsfjord Municipality in 1957) was officially separated from the town of Vardø in 1868. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the eastern part of Båtsfjord merged with the town of Vardø to create Vardø Municipality.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name was &quot;Vargøy&quot;. The first element is &quot;vargr&quot; which means &quot;wolf&quot; and the last element is &quot;øy&quot; which means &quot;island&quot;. The first element was later replaced (around 1500) with &quot;varða&quot; which means &quot;cairn&quot;. Historically, the name was spelled &quot;Vardöe&quot;.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms dates to 1898. Its borders are drawn using the national colours: red, white, and blue. The border frames the shield, and the centre field shows a complex scene incorporating a sunrise with rays, two fishing boats with crews, the sea with waves, and a large cod. In the chief is the year of the town&#x27;s foundation, 1789, together with the words &quot;Vardöensis Insignia Urbis&quot;, meaning &quot;the seal of the town of Vardø&quot;. In the lower part of the arms is the town motto: &quot;Cedant Tenebræ Soli&quot;, meaning &quot;Darkness shall give way to the sun.&quot; This is a high resolution version of the coat of arms.

===Churches===

The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Vardø. It is part of the Varanger prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==History==
Vardø has a long settlement history before it was granted status as a town in 1789. Several stone-age sites as well as sites dating from the Sami Iron Age are known on the island. In the Medieval period, Vardø&#x27;s importance grew as a result of it being the easternmost stronghold of the then-expanding Norwegian royal power. A church was built in Vardø in 1307, and the first fortress was established at about the same time. Thick cultural layers in the southeastern part of the town, Østervågen, document continuous habitation in this area reaching back at least some 800 years.

Even if the presence of the fortress and king&#x27;s bailiff gave Vardø a certain degree of permanence and stability not experienced by other fishing communities in Finnmark, the town&#x27;s size and importance waxed and waned with the changing fortunes of the fisheries. In the mid-16th century Vardø had a population of 400 to 500 people. By 1789, however, it had reduced to about 100.

In the 17th century, Vardø was the center of a great number of witchcraft trials. More than 90 persons, Norwegian and Sami, were given death sentences. They are commemorated in the Steilneset Memorial.

In 1769, the Hungarian astronomer Maximilian Hell and his assistant János Sajnovics, delegated by Christian VII of Denmark, traveled to Vardø to observe the Transit of Venus.

After 1850, the town saw a marked expansion. The fisheries grew in importance, and so did the Pomor trade with Russia&#x27;s White Sea region. In 1850 the population reached 400, and in 1910 it passed 3 000.

During World War II, with Norway occupied by the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, Vardø was heavily bombed by Allied, mostly Russian forces. Most of the town center was destroyed, and the population was evacuated. After the war, the city center was completely reconstructed, but older, traditional houses survived in the periphery, such as in the old town in Østervågen.

As of 2017, the fishing industry had collapsed. From 1995 to 2017, the population shrank by 50 percent to 2,100 people. In May 2017 work to lay a new electric cable from the Norwegian mainland to the island began. The additional electricity is needed to power the American-funded GLOBUS space surveillance system, located about 40 miles from Russia&#x27;s Kola Peninsula, a territory studded with high-security naval bases and restricted military zones. The secrecy surrounding the radar systems has spawned fears that officials are covering up health hazards and other possible dangers. The electromagnetic pulses the current radar system emits interfere with television and radio reception, and some residents have blamed them for a rash of miscarriages and cancer cases in a civilian district next to the fenced-in security zone.

The town was selected as the millennium site for Finnmark county.

==Government==
All municipalities in Norway are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Indre og Østre Finnmark District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

==Geography==

Vardø is the easternmost town in Norway and the Nordic countries, located at 31°E, which is east of Saint Petersburg, Kyiv and Istanbul. The eastern part of Finnmark is in the same time zone as the rest of the country, despite daylight shifted by more than an hour. The town is on the island of Vardøya, but the municipality includes significant area on the mainland of the Varanger Peninsula, including part of the Varangerhalvøya National Park in the southwest. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Grythaugen.

The mountain Domen lies on the shore of the Varanger Peninsula. South of it lies the small Kibergsneset peninsula, where the village of Kiberg is. The town lies on the island of Vardøya, which is surrounded by a few smaller islands. Hornøya is one of them. It is northeast of Vardøya and is the site of Vardø Lighthouse. The mouth of the Varangerfjorden lies along the municipality&#x27;s eastern coast.

===Climate===

The port of Vardø, on the Barents Sea, remains ice-free all year round thanks to the warm North Atlantic drift. Vardø earlier had a tundra climate (Köppen: &quot;ET&quot;), but as a result of warming, Vardø now has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) using the official 1991-2020 period, because the monthly mean temperatures in July and August has passed the threshold. Excluding high mountain areas, it was earlier the only town in Norway proper (excluding Svalbard and Jan Mayen) with a polar climate. The town is on an unsheltered island in the Barents Sea and treeless. The &quot;midnight sun&quot; is above the horizon from 16 May to 29 July, and the period with continuous daylight lasts a bit longer, polar night from 24 November to 19 January. The average date for first overnight freeze (below ) in autumn is October 12. The weather station Vardø Radio (10 m) started recording in June 1829.
===Fauna and flora===
The municipality of Vardø with its seabird colonies of Hornøya and Reinøya are among the most interesting on this part of the coast. There is a small breeding population of Brunnich&#x27;s guillemot as well as larger numbers of razorbill and common guillemot.

The climate is too cold in summer and too windy in winter for trees, but a few planted trees exist in wind-sheltered locations, generally rowans.

==Transportation==
The island is connected to the mainland via the undersea Vardø Tunnel which was Norway&#x27;s first such structure. Vardø Airport and the settlement of Svartnes are on the mainland opposite the tunnel entrance. Vardø is a port of call on Norway&#x27;s Hurtigruten ferry service. The town is the northern termination of European route E75, which starts in Sitia, Crete.

==Media==
The newspaper &quot;Østhavet&quot; has been published in Vardø since 1997.

==Economy and tourism==
Fishing and seafood processing remain Vardø&#x27;s major sources of income, although tourism is starting to become an important economic factor.

Vardø&#x27;s tourist attractions include the Vardøhus Festning, a fortress dating back to the 14th century (although the present structure dates from 1734); the witchcraft trials memorial; several sea bird colonies; two museums: the Pomor Museum and the Partisan Museum; and remnants of German fortifications from World War II. The Yukigassen competition in Vardø is unique in Norway.

Vardøhus Festning is home to two rowan trees that are diligently nurtured and warmed in winter since they cannot normally survive in Vardø&#x27;s climate, north of the Arctic tree line. Seven trees were planted in 1960; the one that survived managed to blossom twice, in 1974 and 1981. It finally succumbed to the cold in 2002, but two new saplings have been planted in its place.
In the summer of 2012, Vardø hosted the urban art event Komafest, where 12 international artists painted tens of the town&#x27;s abandoned houses in a three-week period.

===River fishing===
Fishing permits (for salmon fishing) are sold for use on specific rivers, including Komag-elva.

== GLOBUS Radar ==
Since 1998, the town has housed radar installations called GLOBUS I, II and III. Its official purpose is the tracking of space junk, but due to the site&#x27;s proximity to Russia and an alleged connection between the GLOBUS system and US anti-missile systems, the site has been the basis for heated controversy in diplomatic and intelligence circles. In March 2017 and again in February 2018 Russia executed mock air strikes aimed at Vardø, presumably because of the radar site. Both times military aircraft took off from the Kola Peninsula in attack formations, but stopped short of Norwegian airspace.

<text>Vadsø (; ; ) is a municipality in Finnmark County, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Vadsø, which is also the administrative centre of Finnmark county. Other settlements in Vadsø include Ekkerøy, Kiby, Krampenes, Skallelv, Valen, and Vestre Jakobselv.

The municipality is the 83rd largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Vadsø is the 166th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 5,807. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 6.7% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The village of Vadsø was granted town status in 1833. In 1838, the town of Vadsø and the entire rural district surrounding the Varangerfjorden were established as the new Vadsø Municipality (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The law required that all towns should be separated from their rural districts, but because of a low population and very few voters, this was impossible to carry out for the municipality of Vadsø in 1838. (This was also true in the nearby towns of Hammerfest and Vardø.)

In 1839, the western district (population: 598) was separated to become the new Nesseby Municipality. This left Vadsø with 388 residents. In 1858, Vadsø Municipality changed again: Nesseby Municipality (population: 706) was merged back into Vadsø and the district of Vadsø located south of the Varangerfjorden (population: 1,171) was separated to form the new Sør-Varanger Municipality. This change resulted in a population of 2,050 in Vadsø Municipality. In 1864, the western district of Vadsø (population: 866) was separated (once again) to re-create Nesseby Municipality, leaving Vadsø with 1,367 residents.

On 1 January 1894, the rest of the rural district (population: 1,296) surrounding the town of Vadsø was separated to form the new Nord-Varanger Municipality. This left just the town of Vadsø remaining in the municipality of Vadsø which now had 1,114 residents. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Nord-Varanger Municipality (population: 1,587) was merged with the town of Vadsø (population: 3,353) to form the present-day Vadsø Municipality.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality is named after the town of Vadsø. The name of the town comes from the island Vadsøya, since that was the original townsite. The Old Norse form of the name would be &quot;*Vazøy&quot;, &quot;*Vatsøy&quot;, &quot;*Vassøy&quot;; the eldest references to the town show the forms &quot;Vasthøen&quot; (1520) and &quot;Vaadsøenn&quot; (1567). The first element is the genitive case of which means &quot;water&quot; and the last element is which means &quot;island&quot;. Therefore, the meaning of the name is &quot;the island with drinking water&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 20 February 1976. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, a reindeer&#x27;s head couped argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is the head of a reindeer stag. The reindeer head has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. Reindeer husbandry is common in the municipality and of great economic importance, especially important among the Sámi population. The reindeer also symbolizes freedom, strength, and endurance. The arms were designed by Hallvard Trætteberg. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Vadsø. It is part of the Varanger prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==History==
In the 16th century, the settlement of Vadsø consisted of a fishing village and the old Vadsø Church, located on the island of Vadsøya. The settlement later moved to the mainland. Pomor trade led Vadsø to be a major trading centre in this part of Norway. Township privilege was granted in 1833, and soon settlers came from Finland and the northern part of Sweden, which suffered from famine.

Finnish was rapidly becoming the language of the majority, and this continued for decades. As of 2016, Finnish is still spoken in some households. During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Vadsø suffered several air raids from the Soviet Union, which bombed German troops. However, there are, unlike most places in Finnmark, a number of 19th century wooden houses preserved close to the city centre, notably the house of Esbensen, built by a Norwegian, and the house of Tuomainen, built by a Finn. On the island of Vadsøya is the airship mast used by Umberto Nobile and Roald Amundsen for their expedition over the North Pole with the airship &quot;Norge&quot; in 1926, and used again on Nobile&#x27;s flight with the airship &quot;Italia&quot; in 1928.

==Government==
All municipalities in Norway are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Indre og Østre Finnmark District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

<doc id="177999" wikidata="Q6459" url="?curid=177999" title="Kautokeino Municipality">
<text>Kautokeino (; ; ; ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Guovdageaidnu/Kautokeino. Other villages include Láhpoluoppal and Máze.

The municipality is the largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Kautokeino is the 236th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,848. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 2.8% over the previous 10-year period.

Guovdageainnu Municipality (Kautokeino) is one of two cultural centers of Northern Sápmi today (the other being the neighboring Kárášjoga Municipality). The most significant industries are reindeer herding, theatre/movie industry, and the public education system. Kautokeino is one of the coldest places in the Nordics.

==General information==

The municipality of Kautokeino was established in 1851 when the large Kistrand Municipality was divided in two: the southern part became Kautokeino Municipality and the northern part remained as Kistrand Municipality. Initially, there were 869 residents in the new municipality. The municipal boundaries have not changed since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The first element in Guovdageaidnu is which means &quot;middle&quot; or &quot;half&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;road&quot; or &quot;way&quot;. Combined it means &quot;half way&quot;, since the location is halfway between two traditional migrating points. It is also the geographic centre of Northern Sápmi. &quot;Kautokeino&quot; is a Finnicized form of the Sámi name , and it is also adopted by the Norwegians.

The official name of the municipality was &quot;Kautokeino&quot; until 1987 when it was changed to the bilingual &quot;Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino&quot;. It was the first municipality in Norway to get a Sami language name. In 2005, the name was again changed, such that either &quot;Guovdageaidnu&quot; or &quot;Kautokeino&quot; can be used interchangeably. The spelling of the Sami language name changes depending on how it is used. It is called when it is spelled alone, but it is when using the Sami language equivalent to &quot;Kautokeino Municipality&quot;.

===Coat of arms===

The coat of arms was granted on 4 September 1987. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, a lavvo Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a lavvo (also spelled &quot;lavvu&quot;). The lavvo has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The lavvu (often spelled as &#x27;lavvo&#x27;) is still in use by reindeer herders who follow their herds according to the season and food availability of food for the animals, and so it was chosen as the symbol for the municipality. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen.

==History==
=== The ice age ===
The area where the Kautokeino settlement is located became ice-free approximately 10,500 years ago after the last Ice age. The northern part of today&#x27;s Kautokeino municipality became ice-free first, approximately 500–800 years before the area where the settlement of Kautokeino is located today. The ice edge retreated south before disappearing completely from Fennoscandia 9,600 years ago, most recently in Sarek in Sweden.

=== The Stone Age ===
In Kautokeino there are traces of human activity stretching back 7,000–9,000 years. The people entering the Kautokeino area when the ice retreated has belonged to one of the three main genetic groups in the postglacial period of early Europe; Eastern Hunter-Gatherers ,Western Hunter-Gatherers or the Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers. At Kautokeino church, arrowheads have been found where the dating extends over a large period of time. The oldest arrowheads date to 5000–7000 BC, while the youngest date to 1000–000 BC. In 2020, the University of Tromsø conducted archaeological excavations at Gáidnomanjávri I Kautokeino, approximately 300 meters northeast of the church. There, among other things, burnt bone remains were found, the oldest of which were dated to 4846-5009 BC.

In Juntevađđa, about 10 kilometers north of Kautokeino, archaeological excavations were carried out in 2018. The results from the samples show that there has been human activity in the area which has been dated back to 5560–5520 BC, mesolithic period. Among other things, bone remains of reindeer were identified.

=== The Iron Age ===
Junttevađđa has traces of human activity spanning a long period of time. In 1967, the archaeologist Povl Simonsen excavated at Junttevađđa, where he uncovered a total of 10 stone piles that lay in a row at intervals of between 5 and 13 metres. He found layers of charcoal in the stone piles, and thought these were fire pits. These stone piles are dated to approximately AD 1050. However, later research has concluded that it is not fire pits, but solid hearths associated with tent settlements that have been used by the Sami population.

=== 1550–1751 ===
Until 1751, Kautokeino was part of Sweden.

In 1695, Kautokeino was part of a [common district,] &quot;fellesdistriktet&quot; - which consisted of Kautokeino and Ávjovárre. The same year, the size of the population of &quot;fellesdistriktet&quot; was recorded as 36 families (recorded by the census performed by tax authorities, and that has later been estimated to likely indicate around 150–200 persons in &quot;fellesdistriktet&quot;).

From 1553, Gustav Vasa&#x27;s bailiffs began systematic taxation of the Sami in the Kautokeino area. There are tax lists from 1553 to 1608, except for the year 1565. In addition, there is an overview of the population and accounting list for 1553. Peter Lorenz Smith writes in the book Kautokeino og Kautokeino lappene: a historical and ergological regional study from 1938 that the &quot;lapp village&quot; in Kautokeino had 8 people in the tax man count in 1553. Today, the term siida is used for what Smith called &quot;lapp village&quot;. He further estimates the total population of the Kautokeino siida to 48 people based on an assumption of 6 people per household. In the Swedish tax accounts from 1553, Kautokeino is called the town of Kwothekyla. Smith believes it may be a combination of the words goahti (Sami for a large tent) and kylla(sic) (kylä, Finnish for hamlet). The siida was located on Goahtedievva, which is near today&#x27;s Kautokeino church. Findings from the Stone Age to our time show that the area has been influenced by human activity for 9,000 years.

In addition to the siida in Kautokeino, there was also a siida at Lahpojávri within today&#x27;s Kautokeino municipality. In 1553 there were 6 people in the tax census and with Smith&#x27;s assumption of 6 people per household a population of 36 people.

The first priest to hold a service in Kautokeino was Johannes Torneaus from Övertorneå. This happened in 1641. The service was held in a small log cabin that had just been set up. It is said to have been Kautokeino&#x27;s first wooden building. Today, the rest of this log cabin is preserved in the Kautokeino museum.

The first resident priest was Swedish Amund Isaksen Curtelius. He wintered in Masi from 1674 to 1675. He was succeeded by Johan Tornberg. In 1682 he was again succeeded by his brother, Anders Nicolai Tornensis. Tornensis had a vicarage built in Kautokeino, and started construction of Kautokeino&#x27;s old church in 1701. The church was consecrated on 11 February 1703, and was named &quot;St. Charles&#x27; Church&quot;. The old Kautokeino church was consecrated as a church for 241 years and 296 days before it was burned down by the German occupation forces on 3 December 1944, and was then Finnmark&#x27;s oldest Protestant church.

There is little written source material about Kautokeino from before around 1550.

=== 1752–1940 ===
In 1752, church herder Johan Björkman was registered as the only permanent resident in Kautokeino. By 1756, it was reported that there were three permanent resident families at the church site: Matz Hinderson Hetta and his family, bell-ringer Michel Andersson Kemi and his family, and Oluf Andersson Tornensis and his family. The reindeer herding Sami around Kautokeino led a nomadic existence, following the migrations of the reindeer. P.L Smith estimates in the book &quot;Kautokeino og Kautokeino lappene&quot; that the population in the area covering today&#x27;s Kautokeino municipality was 481 people in 1754, based on church records, which he considers to be a fairly accurate census shortly after Kautokeino became part of Norway following the border drawing in 1751.

In 1845, measurements were made for Struve Geodetic Arc at the mountain tops of Lodiken (Luvdiidcohkka) and Bealjasvarri in Kautokeino.

==== Russia Bans Reindeer Migration Across the Border to Finland ====
Major Emigration from Kautokeino In 1852, the border to Finland was closed to reindeer migration. This led to a significant number of reindeer herding Sami moving from Kautokeino, with a particularly large emigration to Karesuando, but many also moved to Skjervøy Municipality. P.L Smith writes in the book &quot;Kautokeino og Kautokeino lappene&quot; that 310 people moved from Kautokeino to Karesuando and Skjervøy between 1852 and 1889, taking with them approximately 25 to 30 thousand reindeer. It is estimated that about 60 people later moved back to Kautokeino.

In 1852, Kautokeino was the site of a Sami uprising against representatives of the Norwegian authorities. This was one of the few violent reactions by the Sami against the exploitation policies of the Norwegian government and was the only known confrontation between Samis and Norwegians with loss of human lives.

==== The first emigration to Alaska in 1894 ====
On April 10, 1894, 19 people left Kautokeino for Alaska, consisting of 6 families and 1 bachelor. The journey was organized by Willian A Kjellmann from Talvik on behalf of Sheldon Jackson in Alaska. Sheldon Jackson&#x27;s purpose was to use the Sami&#x27;s expertise in reindeer herding to teach this knowledge to the Inuit in Alaska. The names of those who left from Kautokeino are listed below, organized by families: Per Aslaksen Rist and his wife Berit Anne Andersdatter Spein with their daughters Marit and Inger. Johan Speinsen Tornensis, his wife Marit Grete Salomonsdatter Näkkäläjärvi, and their daughter Marit. Mikkel Josefsen Näkkälä and his wife Berit Anne Klemetsdatter Hætta. Samuel Johnsen Kemi, his wife Kirsten Persdatter Bals, and their children Samuel and Karen. Mathis Aslaksen Eira, his wife Berit Johannsedatter Hætta, and their son Aslak. Aslak Larsen Somby and his wife Brita Olsdatter Nango. Bachelor Fredrik Larsen.

==== The 1898 Manitoba Journey ====
Departing from Alta on February 4, 1898, the vessel Manitoba set sail for New York. It carried 539 reindeer and 113 passengers, including 44 individuals from Kautokeino, all part of the Manitoba Journey. This expedition aimed to avert starvation among Klondike gold miners by moving reindeer from Finnmark to the Klondike. Additionally, it sought to establish reindeer farming in Alaska as a means to provide a consistent food source for Alaskans.

==== Population Figures in 1900 ====
The year 1900 saw Kautokeino home to 267 settled Sami individuals and 522 Sami engaged in reindeer herding, making up a total population of 789. In total, 63 people traveled to Alaska from Kautokeino in 1894 and 1898. Relative to the population in 1900, 63 people would have constituted about 7% of the population in 1900. Some of those who traveled in 1894 and 1898 later returned to Kautokeino, so the number does not precisely indicate the proportion of the population in Kautokeino that emigrated to America permanently.

==== Referendum on the dissolution of the union in 1905 ====
In Kautokeino, 100% of those who voted in the referendum were in favour of Norway being a kingdom after the dissolution of the union with Sweden. Kautokeino was one of 2 municipalities in Norway where 100% voted for the kingdom.

==== Reindeer Herding Project in Newfoundland 1908-1910 ====
On 14 December 1907, the ship Anita departed from Alta bound for Newfoundland in America. Onboard were two families from Masi in Kautokeino, a married couple from Kvalsund, and 300 reindeer. In 1909, another family from Masi joined them. The purpose of the journey was to introduce reindeer herding in Newfoundland. A total of 12 individuals from Masi made the trip in 1908 and 1909. The project concluded in 1910, and the families returned to Masi. A child was born in Newfoundland, so in total, 13 people returned to Masi in 1910.

==== The Otto von Rosen affair ====
Between 15 and 20 January 1917, the Swedish Baron Otto von Rosen was arrested in what is now the Kautokeino municipality or in today&#x27;s Karasjok municipality, near the border with Finland. He was suspected of espionage. He was sent to Kristiania (now Oslo) and released in February 1917 without conviction but expelled to Sweden. It turned out that when his luggage was searched, it contained spy equipment and a sugar cube containing anthrax bacteria. This was confirmed by analysis 80 years later. Otto von Rosen had been mentioned in newspapers for suspicious activity in the Karesuando area earlier in January, and was then suspected of being a German spy. Finland in 1917 was part of the Russian Empire and at war with Germany. The distance between Karesuando and Kautokeino is approximately 70 kilometers in a straight line.

==== The Spanish flu 1919 ====
Kautokeino was severely affected by a wave of the Spanish flu in January 1919; that month, 24 people died in the municipality, corresponding to 2.2% of the population. In 1920, Kautokeino had a population of 979 people.

==== Telephone to Kautokeino ====
Kautokeino was connected to the country&#x27;s telephone network in October 1919 when the telephone line to Alta was completed.

==== Reindeer Herding Project in Baffin Island 1921-1923 ====
In 1921, 3 families from Masi and 1 bachelor from Kautokeino were recruited for a reindeer herding project in Baffin Island, Canada, under the auspices of the Hudson Bay Company. The group, consisting of 13 people and 600-700 reindeer, departed from Alta on 19 October 1921, aboard the ship Nascobie. Their destination was Amadjuak Bay on Baffin Island, and the purpose of this reindeer herding project was the same as previous ones involving reindeer in America, namely to introduce domestic reindeer herding and thus ensure a stable food supply for the residents. The project concluded in 1923, and all participants returned home to Masi and Kautokeino.

==== Reindeer herding project at the mouth of the Mackenzie River from 1931 ====
3 families from Kautokeino traveled to the northern coast of Canada, to the area where the Mackenzie River flows into the sea, near the present-day town of Inuvik, which was founded later in 1953. The group totaled 10 people. The purpose of this project, too, was to introduce reindeer herding and secure a stable food supply for the local population. Two of the families returned to Kautokeino after 5 and 7 years, while one family remained in Canada, and their descendants continued reindeer herding in the area until recently. The reindeer were sourced from Alaska, and the chief herder who led the reindeer from Alaska to the mouth of the Mackenzie River was Anders Bær, born in the mountains between Kautokeino Municipality and Karasjok Municipality, with a father from Kautokeino. He had emigrated to Alaska in 1898. The journey from Alaska to the mouth of the Mackenzie River took 5 years, from 1929 to 1935. Anders Bær earned the nickname &quot;the Arctic Moses&quot; after leading the reindeer to Canada.

==== Crown Prince couple visits Kautokeino ====
On Tuesday, 27 March 1934, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha arrived in Kautokeino. The Crown Prince couple stayed in Kautokeino until Thursday, 29 March (Maundy Thursday), before continuing to Karasjok. In Kautokeino, the royal couple was greeted by 80 children who sang three songs in Sami to honor their arrival. On Maundy Thursday, the Crown Prince couple attended a service at Kautokeino Old Church from 1701 before departing further to Karasjok.

==== Nomadic life ====
Adolf Steen writes in his book Kautokeino Studies that in the 1930s there was one winter house in the eastern mountains, which means that the vast majority of reindeer-herding Sami still lived in lavvu (traditional Sami tents) and gamme (turf huts) all year round.

=== World War 2 ===

==== 1940–1943 ====
During the war at the Narvik front in the spring of 1940, at least four soldiers from Kautokeino took part; they belonged to the Alta Battalion.

In August 1940, four German soldiers came to Kautokeino by riverboat; they were the first German soldiers on the scene. They traveled again, and there was no permanent German presence in Kautokeino until the winter of 1941. Then they requisitioned the boarding school for accommodation.

A Serbian prisoner of war named Bora Ivankovic was arrested by the Germans in autumn 1942 and executed in Kautokeino. Together with Petar Filipovic, he had managed to escape from the prison camp in Karasjok. After 28 days on the run, Petar Filipovic managed to get into Sweden.

In 1942, the Germans planned to build a railway line through Kautokeino municipality. The line was to go via Reisadalen to Kautokeino and on to Karasjok. The railway was part of the German Polar Railway, which was planned to run all the way from Fauske to Kirkenes. The plan was stated in 1943.

In 1943, the Germans built a field airport with a runway of 1,200 meters in Kautokeino. At the end of the runway there is still the wreckage of a German Junkers Ju 52.

==== 1944 ====

The Sámi author Odd Mathis Hætta writes in the book &quot;Samebygder på Finnmarksvidda 2&quot; about 3 Serbian prisoners who had escaped from a prison camp and who were surprised and taken by the Germans and executed. This happened at Áidejávri, 30 kilometers south of Kautokeino in August 1944. The bodies were dug up and transported to Kautokeino by Norwegian soldiers in the spring of 1945. It is likely that they were not Serbian prisoners but from another nationality, this since the Serbian prisoners were held captive in Karasjok from 23 July 1942 to 15 December 1942, and this incident happened two years later.

A German Focke-Wulf Fw 189 reconnaissance aircraft made an emergency landing on 15 October 1944 at Flyvarjávri 13 kilometers south of Kautokeino. The water was named Flyvarjávri as a result of the accident, which means &quot;plane lake&quot; in Sámi.

In the autumn of 1944, the German 139th Mountain Brigade was stationed in and around Kautokeino. The force consisted of approximately 5,000 soldiers and had arrived in the Kautokeino area no later than 29 October 1944. The 139th Mountain Brigade was formed on 5 June 1944 from the remnants of the 139th Mountain Regiment from the 3rd Mountain Division. The commander of the brigade in the Kautokeino area was Colonel Schirmbacker. He was on loan from the 6th SS Gebirgsjäger division. The 139th Mountain Regiment was the German unit that was about to be defeated by Norwegian forces at Bjørnfjell in June 1940, during the battles of Narvik before Norway had to capitulate when the Allies withdrew. Alta Battalion, where soldiers from Kautokeino also participated, were among the Norwegian units that took part in the battles at Bjørnfjell. The Austrian soldier Toni Russold took part in the battle against the Alta battalion in Narvik in 1940, and was part of the force that made up the flank protection in Kautokeino in the autumn of 1944.

The brigade&#x27;s mission in Kautokeino in the autumn of 1944 was to form the flank protection for the Sturmbock-Stellung line which ran across the Finnish wedge north of Karesuando. The Germans set up positions in Kautokeino due to concerns about a potential Allied landing at Hammerfest and a subsequent assault through Alta, moving directly south towards Finland across the Finnmarksvidda. Their objective woukld be to intercept the 20th Mountain Army&#x27;s 18th Army Corps during their retreat from Finland through the Finnish wedge. Additionally, they aimed to prevent Finnish or, in the worst-case scenario, Russian forces from circumventing the Strumbuck-Stellung line in Karesuando, which would allow them to breach the German positions and proceed towards the Lyngen fjord in Norway. South and southwest of Kautokeino, defensive positions were established at Máttavárri, Joppevárri, Áddjit, Gálggovárri and Junkkavárri. The last German soldiers withdrew from the position in Kautokeino on 3 January 1945. The route they followed was a makeshift cart road that went south-west from Kautokeino to Goathteluoppal, on to Hirvas in Finland and finally the road through the Finnish wedge to Skibotn in Norway. In June 2022, shells were found in the area around the German positions from 1944 at Máttavárri, 5 kilometers south of Kautokeino. In the autumn of 1941, only 100 of the 2,000 soldiers were left from the 139th Mountain Regiment of those who had taken part in the campaign in Narvik, in that sense Toni Russold&#x27;s period in the regiment and the brigade, from the campaign in Narvik all the way to Kautokeino in the autumn of 1944, must have been one of the longest.

On 23 October 1944, a meeting was held in Kautokeino with representatives of the Germans, the Nazi police, police chief Hoem and representatives of Kautokeino municipality. The municipality reached an agreement with the Nazis and the Germans that the population of Kautokeino together with the large herds of reindeer should evacuate to the Helligskogen in Troms and meet the Germans there. The Germans wanted to take control of the reindeer herds because it constituted a large food reserve for the Germans, they wanted to prevent the Allies from getting hold of this food reserve, and because they feared that Soviet red army could use driving reindeer for transport, in a similar way to reindeer had been used for transport on the Murmansk front. The agreement was announced to the population in Norwegian. However, the verbal order to the population was given in Sámi and there the population was asked to evacuate to Helligskogen at Anarjohka in the east. Police Chief Hoem was aware that the oral order in Sámi was different from the written order in Norwegian. The population had to leave Kautokeino by 30 November 1944. The result was that the population listened to the oral order in Sámi and failed to evacuate to the Helligskogen in Troms, instead they escaped to the Finnmarksvidda and spread out over a large area. The Germans missed out on the meat reserve that the reindeer herds would have represented, and the population avoided forced evacuation. Of Kautokeino&#x27;s 1,330 inhabitants, 47 were forcibly evacuated south. The fate of two women who fell ill and were forcibly evacuated south is still unknown.

Kautokeino was burned down by retreating German forces. The Germans began the burning of the Kautokeino church site on 20 November 1944, and the burning was completed in the first week of December. Of 220 buildings, 168 were burned, including the old Kautokeino church from 1701, which was burned on 3 December 1944.

==Geography==

Guovdageaidnu/Kautokeino is the southernmost municipality of Finnmark county and it shares a border with several municipalities: Alta Municipality to the north, Kárášjoga Municipality to the east, Nordreisa Municipality and Kvænangen Municipality (in Troms county) to the west, and Enontekiö Municipality (in Finland) to the south.

At , it is the largest municipality in Norway. A total of approximately 10,000 lakes cover . A significant part of the Finnmarksvidda plateau is located inside Kautokeino municipality. Anárjohka National Park is partially located in the municipality. The rivers Anarjohka and Karasjohka have their headwaters inside the park. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Mollejus.

The Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino River runs from a lake at the Finnish border, north through the villages of Guovdageaidnu (Kautokeino) and Máze before it leaves into Alta municipality and changes name to Altaelva. The river is collectively known as the &quot;Kautokeino/Alta-vassdraget&quot; and was the site of a major political controversy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The lake Šuoikkatjávri is located on the border of the municipality with Kvænangen. Other lakes in the municipality include Bajášjávri, Bajit Spielgajávri, Biggejávri, Čárajávri, Dátkojávri, Gahččanjávri, Gavdnjajávri, Geađgejávri, Geašjávri, Guolehis Suolojávri, Heammojávri, Iešjávri, Láhpojávri, Latnetjávri, Nuorbejávri, Rágesjávri, Sálganjávri, Soagŋojávri, Stuora Galbajávri, Stuorajávri, Šuoikkatjávri, Suolojávri, Virdnejávri, and Vuolit Spielgajávri.

===Climate===
Kautokeino has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with cool to mild summers and long, cold and fairly dry winters. Located quite far inland on the Arctic highlands of the Finnmarksvidda plateau of Northern Norway, Kautokeino generally has warmer summer days than the coast to the north, but also much colder winter temperatures.

Located above the Arctic Circle at 69°N latitude, Kautokeino experiences midnight sun and polar nights. The Sun does not set for nine weeks in the summer (21 May to 22 July), and does not rise for six weeks in the winter (1 December to 11 January).

Kautokeino is the coldest town in mainland Norway by annual mean temperature. The all-time low was recorded in January 1999. The all-time high was recorded in July 2018, which was the warmest month recorded with mean and average daily high . The coldest month on record is, as for much of Norway, February 1966. That month Kautokeino had mean , average daily high , average daily low - and the warmest high that February was .

Average precipitation ranges from to per year depending on normal period, which is among the lowest amounts in Norway.

During summer, daytime temperatures typically range between and . While this is nice for humans, the temperature, combined with 10,000 lakes, makes it a heaven for mosquitos. Consequently, both humans and reindeer tend to flee to the coast for the summer. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below ) in spring is 31 May and average date for first freeze in autumn is 19 August giving an average frost-free season of 79 days (1981-2010 average).

While winter usually lasts from mid-October until well into April, the hard winter is only for December–February. During hard winter, temperatures can drop as far as and beyond.
&lt;br&gt;
===Birdlife===
Lying south in the county, and bordering with Finland, Guovdageaidnu/Kautokeino has a very interesting birdlife. There are virtually thousands of lakes in the municipality, and these combined with the Altaelva waterway system provide habitats for a whole host of wetland species. Whooper swan can sometimes be found while spotted redshank are not uncommon.

==Transportation==
The nearest airports are Alta Airport, about from Kautokeino, and Enontekiö Airport, about from Kautokeino. The small Kautokeino Airport is located in the village, but it has no commercial services.

==Population==
In the village of Guovdageaidnu/Kautokeino, about 1,300 of the 3,000 people in the municipality reside. The village of Máze has about 400 people, while the remaining people in the municipality live in 14 smaller villages scattered around the area.

Also, the number of people older than 66 years is half of the national average. The gender ratio amounts to 86 women for every 100 men. For the last couple of years, Kautokeino has been plagued by high rates of unemployment, peaking at 10% in 2006/2007.

Most teachers speak Sámi as their mother tongue allowing for classes to be taught in Sámi. In addition to ordinary courses, students can also study duodji (traditional Sámi crafts) and reindeer herding. In fact, it is the only high school in the world that features a reindeer herding class.
* Sámi allaskuvla - the Sámi University College. The college has national responsibility for Sámi higher education, including teacher-, and journalist-training. The college attempts to develop the syllabuses on the basis of Sámi needs, and attempts to develop Sámi as an academic language.

* The department of education of the Norwegian Sami Parliament.

The Sámi are also internationally active with regards to indigenous people issues and reindeer husbandry. Therefore, the following institutions are also located in Guovdageaidnu/Kautokeino:

==Cultural events==

Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino is perhaps the cultural center of Northern Sámi today, and hosts several of the most well known Sami cultural events. The biggest event is the Sámi Easter Festival. Easter has traditionally been the time when the Sámis gather to celebrate weddings and confirmations. Today, also the Sami culture is celebrated with many yoik concerts, Sami theater shows, reindeer races, snowmobile races, ice fishing competitions, parties, and the Sámi Grand Prix; a Sámi version of the Eurovision Song Contest where in addition to the best song, the best yoik is also selected. In addition, the Sami Film Festival is usually held during the Easter, which is notable for having an outdoor cinema made of snow.

In June, the annual Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino Walk/Bicycle Ride, has Sámis return to Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino, just to walk a few kilometers, or ride a bicycle for twice the distance.

In August, there is the White Fish festival, as well as the Autumn Festival. The latter is a weekend-long party full of concerts, but also includes snowmobile skipping races on the (unfrozen) river. If the riders go too slow or make too sharp a turn, the snowmobile sinks.

<doc id="178000" wikidata="Q6535" url="?curid=178000" title="Alta Municipality">
<text>Alta (; ; ; ) is the most populated municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Alta. Some of the main villages in the municipality include Kåfjord, Komagfjord, Kvenvik, Langfjordbotn, Leirbotn, Rafsbotn, Talvik, and Tverrelvdalen.

The town of Alta and most of the municipality is located just below the 70th latitude and is closer to the North Pole than it is to much of Central Europe and the British Isles. The town is the northernmost settlement of urban significance in the European Economic Area, with municipalities north of Alta being sparsely populated. In spite of its high latitude the local climate is seldom severely cold thanks to Gulf Stream moderation in the prevailing wind, and lower altitudes of the municipality are covered with boreal forests. Due to Norway curving above its Nordic neighbours, Alta is located further east than almost all of Sweden and much of southern Finland. Being at a very high latitude, midnight sun and polar night are present for sizeable parts of the year.

The municipality is the 7th largest municipality by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Alta is the 59th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 21,708. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 9.5% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The old Alten-Talvig Municipality was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). Not long afterwards, on 1 January 1863, it was divided into two: Talvik Municipality to the north (population: 1,938) and Alta Municipality to the south (population: 2,442). On 1 January 1964, the two neighboring municipalities were merged back together to form a new Alta Municipality. Prior to the merger, Alta had 6,629 residents and Talvik had 3,266 residents. The borders have not changed since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the local Altafjorden. The name possibly comes from the Old Norse words or which refer to a swan. It could also be the Norwegianization of the Finnish word () which refers to a &quot;lowland&quot;. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Alten&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Alta&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 9 July 1976. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, a spearhead argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a spear head. The spear head has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field symbolizes the local river, sea, and mountains. The spear head is derived from the findings of quartzite spear heads dating back to the late Stone Age and found in the area. The quartzite was quarried in the municipality and tools made from it were used all over Northern Norway.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has two parishes () within the municipality of Alta. It is part of the Alta prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==History==
The rock carvings at Alta, located near the Jiepmaluokta bay, dating from c. 4200 BC to 500 BC, are on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. The Komsa culture was named after Komsa Mountain in Alta municipality, where the first archeological remains of this culture were discovered.

In the aftermath of the Sami Kautokeino rebellion of 1852, rebel leaders Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jacobsen Hætta were decapitated at Elvebakken in what is now the town of Alta on 14 October 1854.

Their bodies were buried in graves just outside the Kåfjord Church graveyard in the village of Kåfjord in Alta, but their heads were sent on to the &quot;Anatomisk Institute&quot; at the University of Oslo, where they were kept for more than a century as part of the university&#x27;s skull collections. The two skulls were only relinquished by the university in 1985, following a controversy and protests by Sami activists, and were in November 1997 buried at the Kåfjord Church in Alta, at the same spot as their bodies were buried over 140 years earlier.

During World War II, the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; used the Kåfjorden, an arm of Altafjorden, as a harbour, and was damaged here by attacking Allied warplanes. The town Alta was seriously destroyed by fire near the end of the World War II. It was rebuilt in subsequent years.

The &quot;Altasaken&quot; in 1979 made headlines for weeks, as many people (especially Sami people and environmentalists) demonstrated and used civil disobedience to prevent the building of a dam on the river Altaelva in order to produce hydropower. The dam was built, however, and the river still offers good salmon fishing. The King of Norway usually visits the river once in the summer to fish.

The urban area made up of Bossekop, Elvebakken, and Bukta, also known collectively now as the town of Alta, became a town on 1 January 2000. The population has been growing steadily for many years.

On 31 August 2019, a sightseeing helicopter crashed in the mountains of Skoddevarre south of Alta.

==Geography==
Alta Municipality covers , in western Finnmark, mostly situated along the Altafjord, including large tracts of woodlands, as well as parts of the Finnmarksvidda plateau. On its way from the plateau down to the fjord, the river Altaelva has carved out the Sautso canyon, one of the largest canyons in Europe. The large Altafjorden has several notable bays and fjord arms that branch off from it including Langfjorden, Jiepmaluokta, Kåfjorden, and Lille Kufjorden.

Alta is based on the mainland of Norway, but it also includes parts of the islands of Stjernøya and Seiland. Seiland is the home of Seiland National Park where the Seilandsjøkelen glacier and the mountain Seilandstuva are located. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain &quot;Store Haldi&quot;.

<text>Loppa ( and ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Øksfjord. Other villages in Loppa include Andsnes, Bergsfjord, Langfjordhamn, Loppa, Nuvsvåg, Øksfjordbotn, Sandland, and Sør-Tverrfjord.

The municipality is the 167th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Loppa is the 343rd most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 864. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 15.9% over the previous 10-year period.

Most people live in the village of Øksfjord, but smaller communities are spread out along the shores and islands, notably Nuvsvåg, Sandland, Bergsfjord, Brynilen, and the island of Loppa. This island was previously the administrative centre of the municipality (hence the name). There is no airport, but Øksfjord is a port of call for the Hurtigruten boats.

==General information==

The municipality of &quot;Loppen&quot; (later spelled &quot;Loppa&quot;) was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1858, the northern part of Loppa on the island of Sørøya and most of Loppa on the island of Stjernøya (population: 506) was separated to form the new Hasvik Municipality. This left Loppa with 801 residents. The borders of the municipality have not changed since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Loppa (), since it was the former centre of the municipality and the first church (Loppa Church) was located there. The meaning of the name is uncertain, however it is mentioned to be of Norse origin. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Loppen&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Loppa&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 19 December 1980. The official blazon is &quot;Or a cormorant wings elevated sable&quot; (). This means the arms have a charge that is a great black cormorant in sable. The field (background) has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The cormorant was chosen as a symbol since the municipality has several typical fishing villages which often attract cormorants which are reputed to be good fish-catchers. The yellow color in the field symbolizes the riches from the local fishing industry. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Loppa. It is part of the Alta prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. In the medieval ages Loppa was its own parish, with traces after an old church in the fishing village of Yttervær, on the island Loppa.

==Geography==
Loppa is the westernmost municipality of Finnmark and it faces the open stretch of the Norwegian Sea called Lopphavet, and it is mostly coastal with fjords and islands under the gigantic snowcap of the Øksfjordjøkelen glacier. The municipality includes most of the peninsula between the Kvænangen and the Altafjorden. There are also several islands in the municipality, notably Loppa, Silda, and part of Stjernøya. The mountains Lopptinden and Svartfjellet both lie in the municipality along with the glaciers Langfjordjøkelen, Øksfjordjøkelen, and Svartfjelljøkelen. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Øksfjordjøkelen.

== History ==
The area of Loppa is suggested to have been inhabited since the Mesolithic times with traces after settlement and scattered findings in both Nuvsvåg, Øksfjord, Sandland, Loppa, Silda and Bergsfjord. The activity of fishing and whaling in the municipality seems to have its origins from ancient times.

=== Roman Age ===
Little is known of this period historically and archaeologically in this area. However the discovering of a Roman Age longhouse from 120 AD, at the island of Loppa shows the earliest signs of settlement in the Early Iron Age. Perhaps was this the very beginning of Norse taxation of the Sami peoples in the area and the interaction between the two peoples of trade and commerce in fishing and the industry of the hunting of maritime mammals. The longhouse is also one of the oldest one ever discovered in Northern Norway.

=== Viking Age ===
In 1962 a rich female Viking Age grave was discovered on the island of Loppa. It contained luxurious personal objects such as tortoise brooches, a round brooch in the Oseberg style, a whalebone plaque, beads, knife, scissor and an arrowhead. The female grave was dubbed &quot;The Queens Grave&quot; due to the manner in which she was buried. However she was most likely not a queen but a very important person indeed on Viking Age Loppa. Perhaps a housewife of a local chieftain? The wealth of the grave reflects that of the Norse elite&#x27;s presence in the area. The burial was dated to the 9th century AD.

In 1964 a longhouse from Viking Age was also discovered dated to the end of the 8th century AD. Several other buildings and boathouses was also discovered and dated to the same period as the longhouse and the rich female grave. There is also several burials from Iron Age on the island, where the biggest a burial cairn with the size of 13 meters in diameter. The amount of Iron Age burials and houses suggests that of a more permanent Norse settlement.

=== Middle Ages ===
In Middle Ages, the hunting and the production of oil from marine mammals seems to stop, and fishing becomes more important. Along the coast of Northern Norway we see so called farm mounds of ancient settlements, and at Loppa there are at least 6 farm mounds spread out on the island of Loppa, Silda and at mainland Andsnes. However, the farm mounds of Northern Norway seem to have their upbringing already in Early Iron Age, suggesting that fishing was already a commercial trade before the Middle Ages. On the island of Loppa one of the farm mounds was dated to the 1100s AD, with a church site close by. This suggests that Loppa was its own parish already in the Middle Ages.

The coat of arms was granted on 13 July 1984. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, a gull argent rising&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a seagull that is just taking flight. The seagull has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field and the seagull were chosen by the municipality as a symbol for the local fishing and fish processing industry which attracts many seagulls. The design of the arms was proposed by Martha Gamst from Breivikbotn, and it was refined and finalized by Arvid Sveen. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Hasvik. It is part of the Alta prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==History==
In 1900, Hasvik was connected to the telegraph system of the rest of Norway.

In June 1944, a Catalina aircraft crashed into a mountain in Hasvik, killing the crew of 6; the crew consisted of Soviet airmen wearing American uniforms; the aircraft was flying from the U.S. to Murmansk, Russia via Iceland. (138 PBN-1s produced by Naval Aircraft Factory served with the Soviet Navy, after the NAF transferred ownership via Project ZEBRA). The remains of the crew members were moved out of Norway after World War II.

=== Stranded Soviet warship ===

In the sea off the village of Sørvær, the decommissioned Soviet cruiser Murmansk ran aground on Christmas Eve in 1994. Her towlines had snapped off the nearby North Cape while the vessel was on its way to India to be scrapped. She stayed in Sørvær for 18 years.

In 2012, the operation to removed the vessel started. A breakwater and dry dock was constructed around the vessel to access it from land and demolish it where it rested. The dock around the wreck was sealed in April. By mid-May the dock was almost empty of water and the demolishing of the cruiser began. The project was completed in 2013.

In 2021, a plaque was unveiled in the presence of minister of defence, representatives from embassies of USA and Russia, and a Russian military attaché; 6 Soviet airmen who died in 1944, were honored.

==Government==

<text>Kvalsund ( and ) is a former municipality in Finnmark county in Norway. The area is now part of Hammerfest Municipality. The municipality existed from 1869 until its dissolution in 2020. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Kvalsund. Other villages in the municipality included Áisaroaivi, Kokelv, Oldernes, Oldervik, Revsneshamn, Skaidi.

At the time of its dissolution on 1 January 2020, the municipality was the 37th largest by area out of the 422 municipalities in Norway. Kvalsund was also the 394th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 988. The municipality&#x27;s population density was and its population had decreased by 5.4% over the previous 10-year period.

The Kvalsund Bridge () is a suspension bridge that crosses the Kvalsundet strait from the mainland to the island of Kvaløya.

In 2015, the media said that for four years an application has been filed for establishing Norway&#x27;s largest copper mine, depending on a permit for creating a zone in Repparfjorden for depositing waste from the mine.

==General information==
The municipality of Kvalsund was established on 1 July 1869 when it was separated from the Hammerfest landdistrikt (the rural municipality surrounding the town of Hammerfest). Initially, Kvalsund had 514 residents. On 1 January 1963, the Kokelv area in southern Måsøy Municipality (population: 34) was transferred to Kvalsund.

On 1 January 2020, Kvalsund Municipality was merged into the neighboring Hammerfest Municipality, a decision that the people of the two municipalities had agreed to in 2017.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the Kvalsundet strait (). The first element comes from the name of the island Kvaløya. The island&#x27;s name comes form the Old Norse word which means &quot;whale&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;strait&quot; or &quot;sound&quot;. The Sámi name also translates to &quot;whale strait&quot; ( means &quot;whale&quot; and means strait).

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 27 March 1987. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, three salmon argent in pall heads to center&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is three salmon arranged in pall with their heads facing the centre. The salmon have a tincture of argent which means they are commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field and the salmon were chosen to represent fishing in various forms: as a traditional way of living and source of income, as modern fish farming, and as a recreational activity in the area. The arms were designed by Ingunn Bjerkås. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway had two parishes () within Kvalsund Municipality. It was part of the Hammerfest prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==Culture==
===Aboriginal culture===
Until a few hundred years ago, the Coast Sámi culture was completely dominant in Kvalsund. Norwegian and Kven immigration soon made the area multicultural. During Norwegianization much of the traditional culture was lost. Kokelv is the village that has most successfully preserved elements of Sámi culture, and today has a Coast Sámi museum. The gakti of the Kvalsund region is easily recognizable by dots and jags on the collars (for men) and sleeves (for women).

===Fægstock===
The municipality hosts an annual rock festival known as Fægstock, which takes place in Fægfjord (, meaning &quot;twilight fiord&quot;).

==Government==
While it existed, Kvalsund Municipality was responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment, social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.

==General information==

The town of Hammerfest and the vast surrounding &quot;rural district of Hammerfest&quot; was established as the municipality of &quot;Hammerfest by og landdistrikt&quot; on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). Soon after (the same year), the northern district (population: 498) was separated to become the new &quot;Maasøe Municipality&quot;, named after the village on the island of Måsøya where the local Måsøy Church is located. The spelling was later changed to Måsøy.

On 1 January 1963, a small area of southern Måsøy, north of Kokelv, (population: 34) was transferred to the neighboring Kvalsund Municipality. On 1 January 1984, the western part of the island of Magerøya (population: 240) was transferred from Måsøy to the neighboring Nordkapp Municipality.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the island of Måsøya () since the first Måsøy Church was built there. The first element is , the diminuitive form of the genitive case of the word which means &quot;little seagull&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;island&quot;. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Maasø&quot; or &quot;Maasøe&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Maasøy&quot;. On 21 December 1917, a royal resolution enacted the 1917 Norwegian language reforms. Prior to this change, the name was spelled &quot;Maasøy&quot; with the digraph &quot;aa&quot;, and after this reform, the name was spelled &quot;Måsøy&quot;, using the letter å instead.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 7 September 1984. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, a gaff bendwise Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a fishing gaff. The gaff has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. A gaff is a stick with a metal hook or a barbed spear (historically it was made of bone). It is used for pulling large fish onto a boat. These fishing gaffs have been used for many centuries in the municipality. The tool was chosen as a symbol for the importance of fishing to the municipality. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Måsøy. It is part of the Hammerfest prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==Government==
Måsøy Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Vestre Finnmark District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

==Geography==

The municipality is located on the northern coast of western Finnmark, comprising parts of the mainland (located on the Porsanger Peninsula) and many islands of various sizes. The main islands include Måsøya, Hjelmsøya, Havøya, Ingøya, and Rolvsøya. Most people live in the village of Havøysund, but there are also small hamlets spread around the islands and in the fjord areas, notably Snefjord, Slåtten, Ingøy, Gunnarnes, and Måsøy. The large lake Havvatnet lies in the southern part of the municipality. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Gárdevárri.

===Birdlife===
Lying in the northwest part of the county, Måsøy has a selection of habitats and a varied birdlife. Once again, some of the county&#x27;s largest seabird colonies can be found in the municipality with the island of Hjelmsøya being one of the more interesting. White-tailed eagles can be seen as well as both Arctic skuas and great skuas.

===Climate===
Måsøy has a subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfc), due to the relatively mild winter, but also due to the precipitation pattern with drier summer and wetter winter, which is opposite of the subarctic climate. Fruholmen was earlier a tundra climate, and is close to tundra with 1991-2020 normals. As the weather station is located at an exposed lighthouse, the inhabited areas of the municipality such as Havøysund will be slightly warmer in summer and slightly colder in winter than Fruholmen.

<doc id="178005" wikidata="Q62641" url="?curid=178005" title="Nordkapp Municipality">
<text>Nordkapp (; or ; or ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Honningsvåg, where most residents live. Other settlements in Nordkapp include the villages of Gjesvær, Kåfjord, Kamøyvær, Kjelvik, Nordvågen, Repvåg, Skarsvåg, and Valan.

The municipality is the 127th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Nordkapp is the 231st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,951. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 8.2% over the previous 10-year period.

Around 200,000 tourists visit Nordkapp annually during the two to three months of summer. The main tourist attractions are the North Cape and the nearby Knivskjellodden. The North Cape first became famous when the English explorer Richard Chancellor rounded it in 1553 while attempting to find a sea route through the Northeast Passage. Helnes Lighthouse is located at the entrance to the Porsangerfjorden.

==General information==
This municipality was established on 1 July 1861 when the northern district of Kistrand Municipality was separated to form the new &quot;Kjelvik Municipality&quot;. Initially, the new municipality encompassed the land on both sides of the northern end of the Porsangerfjorden, including the eastern part of the island of Magerøya, and it had a population of 345. The name of the municipality was changed from Kjelvik to Nordkapp in 1950. On 1 January 1984, the western part of the island of Magerøya as well as the small surrounding islands of Gjesværstappan (population: 240) were transferred from Måsøy Municipality to Nordkapp Municipality.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) was named after the old &quot;Kjelvik&quot; farm () since the first Kjelvik Church was built there. The first element is derived from the word which means &quot;helmet&quot; or &quot;kettle&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;cove&quot; or &quot;bay&quot;. The municipality was originally named Kjelvik, but that village was totally destroyed by the Germans in 1944 and it was never rebuilt. As a consequence of this, on 8 July 1949, a royal resolution changed the name of the municipality to &quot;Nordkapp&quot; effective on 1 January 1950. Nordkapp is a Norwegianized form of the English name &quot;North Cape&quot; by which the area was historically known dating back to at least 1553. The Old Norse name of the cape was .

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 19 October 1973. The official blazon is &quot;Per fess angeled Or and gules&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) that is divided by an angeled line. Above the line the field has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. Below the line, the field has a tincture of gules (red). The arms are designed to look like a simplified silhouette of the North Cape, a large cliff in Nordkapp Municipality that is traditionally taken to be the northernmost point in Norway and of the European continent. The red and yellow colors are meant to show the sea under a golden sky representing the midnight sun. The arms were designed by Hallvard Trætteberg.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Nordkapp. It is part of the Hammerfest prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==Government==
Nordkapp Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Vestre Finnmark District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

==Geography==

The municipality encompasses the island of Magerøya, but also parts of the mainland on the Porsanger Peninsula and Sværholt Peninsula on both sides of the Porsangerfjorden. There are many other fjords in the municipality including Duksfjorden, Kåfjorden, Kamøyfjorden, and Skipsfjorden. The main island is Magerøya and there are a few islands located around Magerøya including Gjesvær, Gjesværstappan, Lille Kamøya, and Store Kamøya. The highest point in the municipality is the tall &quot;Savzavárri&quot;.

===North Cape===
The municipality is named after &quot;Nordkapp&quot; (&quot;North Cape&quot;), a cliff that is commonly referred to as the northernmost point of Europe. However, the true northernmost point of the European mainland is Cape Nordkinn (), at 71° 08′ 02″ N, located about from the village of Mehamn on the Nordkinn Peninsula. If Europe&#x27;s northernmost point is allowed to be on an island, then it still is not the North Cape. It would be Cape Fligely on Rudolf Island, Franz Josef Land in Russia, which is located much further north at 81° 48′ 24″ N. If Franz Josef Land is not considered to be in Europe, then Europe&#x27;s northernmost point is the northern point of the island of Rossøya, an islet in Svalbard, north of Spitsbergen at 80° 49′ 44.41″ N.

===Birdlife===

This coastal municipality is like many others in Finnmark, home of large seabird colonies. The island group known as Gjesværstappan is one of the better known with at least 2,500 pairs of razorbill. Away from the coast it is the typical tundra habitat of the region that dominates with lakes, marshes, and areas of willow scrub. Many of the lakes hold breeding wildfowl, with species like long-tailed duck being found.

===Climate===
The populated areas of Nordkapp municipality have a subarctic climate (Dfc) with long, moderately cold winters and short, cool summers. If February were slightly warmer it would be a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). The well known North Cape plateau (cliff) is at 307 m ASL and will be colder with a tundra climate. 
&lt;br&gt;


==Transportation==
Due to the heavy tourist traffic in the summers, Nordkapp has an extensive transportation infrastructure for such a small, remote municipality. The Honningsvåg Airport is located just north of the town of Honningsvåg, with daily connections to Tromsø. The European route E69 highway runs north throughout the municipality from Porsanger to the North Cape. The North Cape Tunnel connects the mainland to the island of Magerøya. The Honningsvåg Tunnel goes through a large mountain near Honningsvåg.

<doc id="178006" wikidata="Q483885" url="?curid=178006" title="Porsanger Municipality">
<text>Porsanger (; ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Lakselv. Other villages in the municipality include Børselv, Brenna, Indre Billefjord, Kistrand, Olderfjord, and Skoganvarre.

The municipality is the 3rd largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Porsanger is the 208th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 3,889 (many of whom have a Kven (Kainu) or Sami background). The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 1.9% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The municipality of &quot;Kistrand&quot; (renamed &quot;Porsanger&quot; in 1964) was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). On 1 January 1851, the southern part of Kistrand (population: 869) was separated to become the new Kautokeino Municipality. On 1 January 1861, the northern part of Kistrand (population: 345) was separated to become the new Kjelvik Municipality. On 1 January 1866, the southern part of Kistrand (population: 515) was separated to become the new Karasjok Municipality.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) was first named after the old &quot;Kistrand&quot; farm since the first Kistrand Church was built there. The first element is possibly derived from the word which means &quot;kid&quot; (as in a young goat). The last element is which means &quot;beach&quot; or &quot;shore&quot;.

On 2 November 1962, a royal resolution changed the name of the municipality to &quot;Porsanger&quot;. The new name comes the local Porsangerfjorden (). The first element is probably the name of the plant or &quot;finnmarkspors&quot; (&quot;Rhododendron tomentosum&quot;). Another theory is that the first element is derived from the Northern Sami word which means &quot;waterfall&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;fjord&quot; or &quot;bay&quot;.

Since 2004, the municipality has had three co-official, co-equal, interchangeable names: , , and , since it has three official languages: Norwegian, Northern Sami, and Kven. The spelling of the Sami and Kven language names change depending on how they are used. In Sami, it is called when it is spelled alone, but it is when using the Sami language equivalent to &quot;Porsanger Municipality&quot;. In Kven, it is called when it is spelled alone, and it is when using the Kven language equivalent to &quot;Porsanger municipality&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 16 June 1967. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, three reindeer salient argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is three leaping reindeer, two over one. The reindeer have a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. Porsanger is one of the largest municipalities in the Northern Norway that is not dependent on fishing. Instead, the local people historically farmed reindeer, which is still an importance source of income for the residents. The arms were designed by Hallvard Trætteberg. 

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Porsanger. It is part of the Indre Finnmark prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==History==
The area has been settled by Norwegians and Sami people since time immemorial. In the 18th century, people from Finland, escaping famine and war, settled along the Porsangerfjorden. These people are today known as Kven. 

==Government==
Porsanger Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

The airport is also used by the Royal Norwegian Air Force&#x27;s Station Group Banak. The Norwegian Army also has a garrison at Porsangermoen (Garrison of Porsanger), and so the military presence in Porsanger is quite heavy.

The local newspapers are Finnmark Dagblad and Ságat. The northernmost winery is located here, using crowberries instead of grapes.

==Geography==

Porsanger Municipality is the third largest municipality in Norway by area, with . The municipality surrounds the inner part of the Porsangerfjorden, the fourth longest fjord in Norway and the longest in Northern Norway. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain &quot;Čohkkarášša&quot;.

The Porsangerfjorden is a wide, open body of water with many islands. The Porsanger Peninsula lies on the western shore of the fjord and the Sværholt Peninsula lies on the eastern shore. The biggest village (and municipal centre) is the village of Lakselv at the fjord&#x27;s southern end. There are many smaller villages spread around the fjord on both sides, notably Kistrand, Olderfjord, Børselv, and Indre Billefjord.

Stabbursdalen National Park, with the world&#x27;s northernmost pine forest, lies just west of the fjord and the village of Lakselv. The Stabburselva river runs through the park. Other notable rivers include the Børselva and Lakselva, both are well known for their salmon fishing. The lakes Gákkajávri and Kjæsvannet are both located in the municipality.

In Porsanger, there is midnight sun from 16 May until 27 July each year and there is polar night from 25 November to 16 January.

===Birdlife===
Porsanger is an area of rich and varied bird fauna. Here one can find such species as pine grosbeak. Away from the woodlands, it is the surrounding wetlands that have the greatest diversity. During spring, thousands of red knots stop to rest and feed along the shores of Porsangerfjord.

===Climate===
Lakselv has a boreal climate with modest precipitation and long winters, but still with annual mean well above freezing, ensuring there is no permafrost. The winters are less severe in terms of cold than would be expected for a town at 70 degrees latitude. The all-time high temperature was recorded on 5 July 2021. This is the warmest temperature ever recorded north of 70 degrees North in Europe. The all-time low is from January 1986. The average date for the last overnight freeze (low below ) in spring is 24 May and average date for first freeze in autumn is 6 September giving a frost-free season of 105 days. 
The weather station (recording since Aug 1945) is located at Banak Airport, from the town.

<doc id="178007" wikidata="Q1825" url="?curid=178007" title="Karasjok Municipality">
<text>or (Northern Sami; ) (also: ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Karasjok. Other villages include Dorvonjárga, Šuoššjávri, and Váljohka.

The municipality is the second largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Karasjok is the 250th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,565. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 4.9% over the previous 10-year period.

A survey conducted on behalf of the Sami Language Council in the year 2000 showed that 94 percent of the population are Sami speakers.

==General information==
The municipality of Karasjok was established on 1 January 1866 when it was separated from the old Kistrand Municipality. Initially, the population of Karasjok was 515. The municipal borders have not changed since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipal name &quot;Karasjok&quot; is a Norwegianized form of the Northern Sami language name . The meaning of the first element is uncertain. It could be &quot;káráš&quot; which is the Northern Sami word for a wooden food platter, or from the Finnish word, , which means &quot;something that sticks&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;river&quot;, whose equivalent in Finnish is .

The official name of the municipality was &quot;Karasjok&quot; until 1990 when it was changed to the bilingual &quot;Kárášjohka-Karasjok&quot;. It was the third municipality in Norway to get a Sami language name. In 2005, the name was again changed, such that either &quot;Kárášjohka&quot; or &quot;Karasjok&quot; can be used interchangeably. The spelling of the Sami language name changes depending on how it is used. It is called when it is used alone, but it is when in the phrase meaning &quot;Karasjok Municipality&quot;. literally translates as Karasjok&#x27;s Commune, &quot;-joga&quot; being the genitive form of the word -&quot;johka.&quot; 

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 27 June 1986. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, three five-tongued flames Or two and one&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is three five-tongued flames with two above one. The flames have a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The red color and flame designs were chosen as a symbol for the importance of fire to the local (nomadic) Sami people. The fire brings both heat and thus survival during the harsh winters, but it is also a major threat, both in the tents as well as in the large pine forests. The fire is also the point around which people gather and it is a guard against dangers. The flag contains three flames also because Kárásjoga-Karasjok is a place where three peoples live: the Sami, Norwegians, and Kvens.

The municipality is situated along the upper river basin of the Deatnu / Tana river and its tributaries: Anárjohka and Kárášjohka. It includes large tracts of the high Finnmarksvidda plateau. Lakes in the region include Čorotjávri, Gásadatjávri, Iešjávri, and Idjajávri. The river valley, unlike the plateau, is covered with pine and birch forests. The southern part of the municipality is part of the Anárjohka National Park. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Vuorji.

===Climate===
Karasjok has a typical subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Eclc&quot;) with cold, long and dry winters, and short summers that can see warm periods. In this far northeastern part of Norway, the climate is much more continental and dry compared to the typical coastal climate in Norway.

Situated in a river valley on this plateau, Karasjok has recorded the coldest official temperature ever in Norway: on 1 January 1886. The warmest temperature ever recorded is recorded July 1914 at an earlier weather station. The warmest month on record was July 2014 with mean and average daily high . The coldest month on record was February 1966 with a mean of . The coldest month in more recent decades is February 2007 with mean and average daily low .

===Wildlife===

The inland habitats of Finnmarksvidda are known for their rich bird life with species like Bluethroat preferring areas with scrub. The Tana river also flows through Karasjok and many of the species found in higher areas use it as a migration route.

In late 2022, there were estimated to be 16 bears are in the municipality.

===Tourism===
The attractions include the Sami parliament, &quot;Samediggi&quot;, the Sami museum, and the Old Karasjok Church, dating from 1807. The Sami parliament was opened in 1989, by King Olav V, the first Sami parliament president was Ole Henrik Magga, from the neighboring Kautokeino Municipality. He was the president for more than eight years. The Old Karasjok Church is the oldest Lutheran church in Finnmark county.

<doc id="178008" wikidata="Q48760" url="?curid=178008" title="Lebesby Municipality">
<text>Lebesby ( and ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Kjøllefjord. Other villages in the municipality include Ifjord, Kunes, Lebesby, and Veidnes.

The municipality is the 8th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Lebesby is the 320th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 1,215. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 9.4% over the previous 10-year period.

The municipality consists of the western half of the Nordkinn Peninsula, along with areas around the Laksefjorden. Most people live in the village of Kjøllefjord. This municipality is dominated by ethnic Norwegians, whereas the areas around the Laksefjorden are predominantly Sami. Fishing is the mainstay of the population.

==Economy==
There are 17 wind turbines that generate electrical power in Kjøllefjord, as of 2024. The world&#x27;s northernmost dairy farm that produces milk () is located in Bekkarfjord.

==History==
The parish of Lebesby was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). In 1864, the eastern part of Lebesby that surrounds the Tanafjorden (population: 1,388) was separated to become the new Tana Municipality. Tana was later separated into three: Tana Municipality, Gamvik Municipality, and Berlevåg Municipality. The borders of Lebesby have remained unchanged since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The origins of the municipal name are uncertain. There are two main possibilities. &quot;Lebesby&quot; may be a Norwegianized form of a Northern Sami name . The first element is the genitive form of the word which means &quot;grey alder&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;reindeer camp&quot; or &quot;dwelling place&quot;. A second option for the origin of the name is that &quot;Lebesby&quot; is a corruption of the Old Norse word . The first element is which is a male name from long ago. The last element is which means &quot;dwelling place&quot; or &quot;farmstead&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 22 July 1988. The official blazon is &quot;Per fess embattled grady with three steps and two peaks Or and Sable&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) that is divided by a line that is &quot;embattled grady&quot;. A line embattled grady consists of series of two or three steps, as if each merlon has a smaller merlon atop it. The field below the line has a tincture of sable and the field above the line has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The idea is that the arms represent the &quot;Finnkirka&quot; (&quot;the Finn Church&quot;), a cliff by the sea in the municipality. This cliff formation has the appearance of a church, and in former times was used by Sami people as a place of sacrifice. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen.

==Geography==

The municipality consists of the areas around the Laksefjorden, including the eastern part of the Sværholt Peninsula and the western half of the Nordkinn Peninsula. At the entrance to the Kjøllefjorden at the northwestern tip of the Nordkinn Peninsula, one finds the spectacular &quot;Finnkirka&quot; sea cliff, so named because of its soaring spires that look like a church. On the other side of the Oksefjorden on the northern end of the peninsula, the Kinnarodden cape (shared with Gamvik Municipality) is the northernmost point on the European mainland. There are several large lakes in the municipality including Kjæsvannet, Store Måsvannet, and Suolojávri. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Rásttigáisá.

===Birdlife===
The same seacliffs mentioned above hold large numbers of breeding seabirds. In fact Norway&#x27;s third largest seabird colony can be found in the municipality. Experiencing a seabird colony is one of nature&#x27;s great experiences, here you can see and listen to thousands of birds with such species as fulmar and Atlantic puffin being a part of a fascinating ecosystem.

===Flora===
The world&#x27;s northernmost birch forest is located in this municipality, near Oksefjorden, east of Kjøllefjord ().

<doc id="178009" wikidata="Q796171" url="?curid=178009" title="Pachisi">
<text>Pachisi ( , ) is a cross and circle board game that originated in Ancient India. It is described in the ancient text &quot;Mahabharata&quot; under the name of &quot;Pasha&quot;. It is played on a board shaped like a symmetrical cross. A player&#x27;s pieces move around the board based upon a throw of six or seven cowrie shells, with the number of shells resting with the aperture upward indicating the number of spaces to move.

The name of the game is derived from the Hindi word , meaning &#x27;twenty-five&#x27;, the largest score that can be thrown with the cowrie shells; thus this game is also known by the name &quot;Twenty-Five&quot;. There are other versions of this game where the largest score that can be thrown is thirty.

In addition to chaupar, there are many versions of the game. (barsis) is popular in the Levant, mainly Syria, while Parchís is another version popular in Spain and northern Morocco. Parqués is its Colombian variant. Parcheesi, Sorry!, and Ludo are among the many Westernised commercial versions of the game. The (&#x27;game of little horses&#x27;) is played in France, and is a popular German variant. It is also possible that this game led to the development of the Korean board game , through the ancient kingdom .

==History==
Games similar to chaupar with different colour schemes along with dice have been identified from the Iron Age during the Painted Grey Ware period from sites in Mathura and Noh (1100–800 BC). Cruciform boards have been depicted from art reliefs of Chandraketugarh dated to 2nd–1st century BC. A 6th- or 7th-century representation of Shiva and Parvati said to be playing Chaupar (a closely related game) in fact depicts only dice and not the distinctive board. In a similar period, a board identical to pachisi was discovered in the Ellora cave system. A Song dynasty (960–1279) document referencing the Chinese game Chupu (), &quot;invented in western India and spread to China in the time of the Wei dynasty (AD 220–265)&quot; may relate to Chaupar, but the actual nature of the Chinese game (which may be more closely related to backgammon) is uncertain. Speculation that Pachisi derived from the earlier game of Ashtapada is plausible but unsubstantiated.
Louis Rousselet wrote:

The game of Pachisi was played by Akbar in a truly regal manner. The Court itself, divided into red and white squares, being the board, and an enormous stone raised on four feet, representing the central point. It was here that Akbar and his courtiers played this game; sixteen young slaves from the harem wearing the players&#x27; colours, represented the pieces, and moved to the squares according to the throw of the dice. It is said that the Emperor took such a fancy to playing the game on this grand scale that he had a court for pachisi constructed in all his palaces, and traces of such are still visible at Agra and Allahabad.

Irving Finkel adds:

To date, these grandiose boards still represent the earliest secure evidence for the existence of the game in India. The game&#x27;s role in the history of India still remains to be investigated. It is often assumed that the gambling game that plays so significant a role in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the classical literary epic, is &quot;pachisi&quot;, but the descriptions, such as they are, do not tie in with the game, and this conclusion is perhaps erroneous.

In 1938, the American toy and game company Transogram introduced a mass market board game version called &quot;Game of India&quot;, later marketed as &quot;Pa-Chiz-Si: The Game of India&quot;.

==Players==

Pachisi is a game for two, three, or four players, four usually play in two teams. One team has yellow and black pieces, the other team has red and green. The team which moves all its pieces to the finish first wins the game.

==Traditional equipment==
Each player has four beehive-shaped pieces (this can be increased to up to 16 pieces on each side in some versions). The pieces of one player are distinguishable from another by their colours: black, green, red, and yellow.

Six cowrie shells are used to determine the amount to move the players&#x27; pieces. The shells are thrown from the player&#x27;s hand and the number of cowries which fall with their openings upwards indicate how many spaces the player may move:

In some versions, seven cowrie shells are used:

The board is usually embroidered on cloth. The playing area is cruciform. There is a large square in the centre, called the Charkoni, which is the starting and finishing position of the pieces. The four arms are divided into three columns of eight squares. The players&#x27; pieces are moved along these columns during play.

Twelve squares are specially marked as castle squares. Four of these are positioned at the end of the middle columns of each arm; the other eight are four squares inwards from the end of the outer columns on each arm. A piece may not be captured by an opponent while it lies on a castle square.

==Gameplay==

Each player&#x27;s objective is to move all four of their pieces completely around the board, counter-clockwise, before their opponents do. The pieces start and finish on the Charkoni.

The playing order is decided by each player throwing the cowries. The player with the highest score starts, and turns continue counter-clockwise around the board. In some versions, each player throws the cowrie shells and pieces cannot move until a 2, 3, or 4 is thrown.

If a 6, 10, or 25 is thrown, the player gets a &quot;grace&quot;, which enables the player to introduce one of their pieces from the Charkoni onto the board. The player then repeats their turn. In other versions, this includes 10, 25, or 35 to introduce another of their pieces. The newly introduced pawn will be landed on square number 1, which is the very first square for every respective player: here, it is said that on throwing 10 or 25, or 35, you will introduce your new pawn at square number 1, and then you will add the second throw numbers that will be appeared on your cowries and 7, 14 as a &quot;grace&quot; without the introduction of pieces (here, it should be clear to players that on throwing 7 or 14, you can not introduce your new pawn, you only get an extra turn). A player needs to have at least one piece on the board to be able to throw a 7 or 14.

Simply put, on throwing 10 or 25, or 35, you can not introduce your new pawn directly to 10 or 25, or 35 number square directly, you have to land the new pawn on square number 1 and then add your remaining numbers. Once your all pawns have entered the game, throwing 10 or 25, or 35 allows you to move the respective numbers ahead.

Each player&#x27;s first piece may leave the Charkoni on any throw after it has been introduced onto the board. Each player moves their pieces down the centre column of their own arm of the board, then counter-clockwise around the outside columns.

A player may have any number of pieces on the board at one time. Only one piece may be moved with a single throw, or if the player chooses, they can decline to move any piece on a throw. In some versions, a player can move any number of their pieces with a single throw. Also, if the player casts a value higher than they are eligible to move in a single throw, then the player automatically loses that turn.

More than one piece of the same team may occupy a single square (not true for all squares in some versions). However, a piece may not move onto a castle square that is already occupied by an opponent&#x27;s piece.

If a piece lands on a square (other than a castle square) occupied by any number of the opponent&#x27;s pieces, those pieces are &quot;captured&quot;/&quot;killed&quot; and must return to the Charkoni. Captured pieces may only enter the game again with a grace throw. A player making a capture is allowed another turn (not true in some versions).

In some versions, a player cannot take their pieces back to the Charkoni/home, unless they have captured/killed at least one of the opponent&#x27;s pieces. Some versions have a rule where if, for example, two players are playing against each other, and Player 1 captures a piece of Player 2, then Player 2, in their immediate turn after being captured for the first time, captures the same piece Player 1 just used to capture, in the same square where the capture took place, then Player 1&#x27;s capture/kill is invalidated. Player 1 will need to recapture Player 2&#x27;s piece again to be able to go back to the Charkoni, but Player 2 is free to go ahead to their respective Charkoni unless the above repeats.

A piece completes its trip around the board by moving back up its central column. Returning pieces may be placed on their side in order to distinguish them from pieces that have just entered. A piece can only return to the Charkoni by a direct throw.

Four of the castle squares are placed so they are exactly 25 moves from the Charkoni. A common strategy is for returning pieces to stay on these squares, where they are safe from capture until a 25 is thrown. The pieces can then finish the game directly. This is where the name of the game comes from.

In some versions, where more emphasis is put on the throwing of the cowries, experienced players can cause cowries to land in a specific way, so there are certain other rules to make the game more exciting.

# If a player has their pieces closer to the end, and does not need a higher value throw, there are ways to nullify the higher value throw.
## If the player casts a 10, 25, or 30, the player needs to consecutively throw either 10, 25, or 30 three times (including the original throw) to nullify the higher value throw.
## If the player casts a 7, the player must consecutively cast a 7 only 3 times (including the original throw) to nullify the throw.
## If the player casts a 14, the player must consecutively cast a 14 only 3 times (including the original throw) to nullify the throw.
# Since throwing three consecutive throws of 10, 25, or 30 in a single turn nullifies them, players can instead throw a 7 or 14 in between to keep their turn going. EX: A player can throw the following in a single turn: 25, 25, 14, 10, 30, 7, 25, 30, 7, 10, 14, 25, 3.
# Once all of the player&#x27;s pieces are introduced onto the board, every time a player throws a 10, 25, or 30, the player must move their piece one additional square, which is known as PYADA. EX: A player casts 25, 25, 3 in their turn, and their pieces can move a total of 53 squares. However, when all the player&#x27;s pieces have already been introduced onto the board, the player can then move a total of 55 squares (25+25+3+1+1), meaning 2 pyadas extra.

<doc id="178010" wikidata="Q113729" url="?curid=178010" title="Gamvik Municipality">
<text>() is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Mehamn. The other notable villages in Gamvik include Gamvik and Skjånes. Gamvik is known as one of the poorest and most undeveloped municipalities in Norway. The number of inhabitants rose at one moment in 2012, but in 2014, after the fish factory closed, the population declined dramatically with the departure of the eastern European fishermen.

Most people live in the village of Mehamn (about 500 inhabitants), which has an airport, Mehamn Airport, and is also a port of call of the hurtigruten coastal boats. The Slettnes Lighthouse near the village of Gamvik is the northernmost lighthouse on the mainland of Europe. Nervei and Langfjordbotn are two very small villages in southern Gamvik that are only accessible by boat. Finnkongkeila is an abandoned village along the Tanafjorden.

The municipality is the 65th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Gamvik is the 331st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 1,070. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 2.6% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The municipality of Gamvik was established on 1 January 1914 when the old Tana Municipality was divided into three municipalities: Tana (population: 1,426) in the south, Berlevåg Municipality (population: 784) in the northeast, and Gamvik Municipality (population: 1,371) in the northwest. The municipal boundaries have not changed since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The Old Norse form of the name may have been &quot;Gangvík&quot;. The first element is then &quot;gangr&quot; which means &quot;path&quot; and the last element is &quot;vík&quot; which means &quot;cove&quot; or &quot;wick&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 28 September 1990. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, three net needles Or in bend sinister&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is three fishing net sewing needles that are arranged diagonally. The net needles have a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. These needles are a characteristic maritime tool used for making and mending the fishing nets used by local fishermen. These arms were chosen to emphasize the importance of fishing in the area.

===Churches===

<doc id="178011" wikidata="Q109489" url="?curid=178011" title="Berlevåg Municipality">
<text>() is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Øst-Finnmark. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Berlevåg.

There are two settlements in the municipality of Berlevåg: the village of Berlevåg and the village of Kongsfjord. The village of Berlevåg is by far the biggest; Kongsfjord only has around 45 inhabitants. Kjølnes Lighthouse is located along the shore, east of the village of Berlevåg.

The municipality is the 100th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Berlevåg is the 341st most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 892. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 15.6% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The municipality of Berlevåg was established on 1 January 1914 when it was separated from Tana Municipality. Initially, there were 784 residents. The borders have remained unchanged since that time.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
There are different opinions of the origin of the name &quot;Berlevåg&quot; (or historically spelled &quot;Berlevaag&quot;). The first is that it relates to an old Northern Sami language name that sounded like &quot;Berlevaggi&quot; or &quot;Perlavaggi&quot;. The second is that it derives from the name of the first settler or explorer at the bay whose name was &quot;Berle&quot; or &quot;Perle&quot;. The last theory of the name Berlevåg (which is less likely) is that the first element derives from the Norwegian word which means &quot;pearl&quot; and the last element is which means &quot;bay&quot;. On 21 December 1917, a royal resolution enacted the 1917 Norwegian language reforms. Prior to this change, the name was spelled &quot;Berlevaag&quot; with the digraph &quot;aa&quot;, and after this reform, the name was spelled &quot;Berlevåg&quot;, using the letter å instead.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 22 July 1988. The official blazon is &quot;Per fess rayonny Or and azure&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) that is divided by a line with a rayonny design with five waves with yellow over blue. The field above the line has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The color below the line has a tincture of azure (blue). The design is meant to symbolize the sun over the waves of the sea that break against the shore. This can represent both the struggle against the sea as well as the dependence on it. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Berlevåg. It is part of the Varanger prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==Transportation==
Berlevåg Airport is located just outside the village of Berlevåg. Norwegian County Road 890 runs through Berlevåg, connecting it to the neighboring municipalities, and the rest of Norway.

Facing rough ocean conditions, the four man-made breakwaters that protect the harbor of Berlevåg have been destroyed several times due to bad weather. The current breakwaters include tetrapods that intertwine and have made for a flexible breakwater that can resist the Barents Sea. The port was completely secured with breakwaters in 1973. Since then, the Coastal Ferry has been able to dock in Berlevåg. Prior to that time, a smaller vessel had to unload cargo and passengers from it in the open sea and then ferry them in to the port.

==Government==
Berlevåg Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Indre og Østre Finnmark District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

==Geography==

The municipality is situated in the northwestern part of the Varanger Peninsula, facing the open Barents Sea to the north and the Tanafjorden to the west. It is an isolated and barren region with mostly rocks and tundra. There are no native trees in Berlevåg because of the cold and windy summers. The municipality also contains the lakes Geatnjajávri and Skonsvikvatnan. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Hanglefjellet.

===Climate===
Berlevåg&#x27;s coastal location serves to moderate temperatures during winter, giving it a marine subarctic climate. Coldest month is February with mean , while warmest month is July and August, both with mean .

===Birdlife===
The sea and the islands along this part of Finnmark&#x27;s coastline are home for thousands of seabirds. As well as the large seabird colonies with thousands of nesting birds, there are also areas of unspoiled nature consisting of mountains, moorlands, and marshes. This enables birdwatching in a natural environment. A 17,855 ha area of marine waters along the coast, including supralittoral and neritic habitats, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a population of Steller&#x27;s eiders.

==History==
===World War II===
Berlevåg, along with the rest of Finnmark, was occupied during World War II. Berlevåg Airport was originally put into use at this time, when German occupying forces constructed it with the help of hundreds of Russian prisoners of war. From 1943 to 1944, there were nearly daily bombing raids from Russia on Berlevåg and the German airfield.

In November 1944, the village was completely burned down and the inhabitants evacuated by force as part of the scorched earth strategy of the Germans. In the aftermath, the Norwegian government wanted to relocate the inhabitants to nearby Kongsfjord because of a better harbour, but they refused, and the village was rebuilt. As there are absolutely no trees in Berlevåg, many of the houses in Berlevåg were built by the help of the wooden planks in the &quot;tarmac&quot; and runway of the previous German airfield.

==Popular culture==
Berlevåg was brought some fame in Norway when the Norwegian film director Knut Erik Jensen made a documentary film about &quot;Berlevåg Mannsangsforening&quot;, Berlevåg&#x27;s men&#x27;s choir. The movie &quot;Heftig og begeistret&quot; () was a big hit 2001 in Norway, first shown at Tromsø International Film Festival. The choir later went on a tour of the United States and were featured at Ground zero in New York City. The choir&#x27;s oldest and most famous member, Einar Strand, died at the age of 98 in 2004.

Berlevåg is also the place for the fictional story &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot; by the Danish author Karen Blixen / Isak Dinesen published in the anthology &quot;Anecdotes of Destiny&quot; (1958). (See also the homonym film Babette&#x27;s Feast.)

<text>or is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Tana bru. Among the other villages in the municipality are Austertana, Bonakas, Polmak, Rustefjelbma, and Skiippagurra.

The municipality is the 5th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Deanu-Tana is the 239th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,807. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 2.6% over the previous 10-year period.

==History==

On 1 January 1864, the large Lebesby Municipality was divided into two. The eastern part (population: 1,388) became the new Tane Municipality and the rest remained as Lebesby. Initially, Tana Municipality included all the land on both sides surrounding the Tanafjorden and the Tana River.

On 1 January 1914, the municipality of Tana was divided into three parts. The southern part (population: 1,426) remained as (a smaller) Tana Municipality. The northern part of the municipality was divided by the Tanafjorden with the western side becoming Gamvik Municipality (population: 1,374) and the eastern side becoming Berlevåg Municipality (population: 784). On 1 January 1964, the neighboring Polmak Municipality (population: 1,072) was merged into Tana. (Polmak was originally part of Nesseby Municipality before 1 January 1903 when it became a separate municipality.)

Tana Municipality marks the furthest Soviet advance into Nazi-occupied Norway.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) was originally named &quot;Tanen&quot;, a Norwegianized form of the Northern Sami name for the area, . The Sami name is identical to the genitive case of Sami word which means &quot;great river&quot; or &quot;large river&quot;, referring to the main river (Tana River) which runs through the municipality. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Tanen&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Tana&quot;.

On 1 September 1992, the name of the municipality was changed to &quot;Deatnu-Tana&quot; to symbolize the two official languages in the municipality. Then in 2005, the name was again changed such that either &quot;Deatnu&quot; or &quot;Tana&quot; can be used. The Sami language name spelling changes depending on how it is used. It is called when it is spelled alone, but it is when using the Sami language equivalent to &quot;Deanu municipality&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 11 May 1984. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, three boats Or in pale&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is three riverboats. The riverboat has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. The red and yellow colors in the arms were chosen to mimic the Norwegian national arms. The three riverboats were chosen because boats like this have been used in the area for centuries. There are three boats to symbolize the three ethnic groups in the border municipality: the Sámi, Kvens, and Norwegians. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen.

==Economy==
In 2013, 29% of the work force was employed in retail, hotels/restaurants and finance; 23% in the healthcare industry and the social sector; 16% in the Secondary sector of the economy; 11% in the primary sector; 9% worked in the education sector; the work force totaled 1,401.

The most important [economic] resources are farmland and [coastal areas, mountains and forests or] &quot;utmark&quot;; the use of these gives [significant results relating to] agriculture.

The world&#x27;s northernmost dairy is &quot;Tine Tana&quot;, and it employs around 30 people.

The Tana Valley is the core area for &quot;the River-Sami Culture&quot; in Finnmark; salmon fishing is central in regard to that culture. According to written sources since the 17th century, fishing has been a major livelihood for the Sami people in the river valley of Tana River.

==Churches==

==Geography==

Deatnu-Tana is situated along the lower river basin of the Tana River, which borders Finland along most of its course. People live in small settlements along the river, notably Sirma, Polmak, Rustefjelbma, Seida, Skiippagurra, Austertana, and Tana bru. Most inhabitants of Tana are Sami people, and the Sami language and culture are today promoted by the municipality and the schools. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Rásttigáisá.

The river Tana has represented a mainstay in the economy, as it is one of Europe&#x27;s main salmon rivers, and it empties into the Tanafjorden. River transportation is traditionally done by long, narrow river boats, that are still in use, albeit motorized. Lakes in this area include Geassájávri, Nissojávri, and Sundvatnet. At Tana bru, the Tana Bridge (part of European route E6 and European route E75) crosses over the Tana River. The nearest airports are Vadsø Airport (about away) and Kirkenes Airport (about away). Kirkenes Airport (but not Vadsø) has direct flights to Oslo.

===Wildlife===
With the Tana River flowing through wild and spectacular habitat, the municipality of Tana has one of the most spectacular gatherings in Norway. As many as 25,000 goosanders can accumulate along the Tana waterway system. Add to this, thousands of common eider and long-tailed duck, then you have one of the largest concentrations of wildfowl in Norway.

In 2022 one bear was killed because of deaths of sheep from a local farm; An investigation deemed the killing of the bear, legal; The report said there likely had been at least one other bear in the municipality.

===Climate===
Tana has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with long, cold winters and short cool summers.

<text>Båtsfjord () is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Båtsfjord (which is the only settlement remaining in the municipality). Båtsfjord Airport is a new, modern airport, located just outside Båtsfjord village. The Hurtigruten coastal express ferry also has regularly-scheduled stops in Båtsfjord village.

The municipality is the 63rd largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Båtsfjord is the 276th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 2,113. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 4.3% over the previous 10-year period.

Historically, there were many other villages in the municipality, but they have been abandoned over the years. Some of these villages include Hamningberg (abandoned in 1964), Makkaur (abandoned in the 1950s), Sandfjord/Ytre Syltefjord (abandoned in 1946), Hamna (abandoned around 1950), and Nordfjord (abandoned in 1989).

==General information==

Vardø Municipality was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law), encompassing the northeastern part of the Varanger Peninsula. In 1839, to comply with the &quot;formannskapsdistrikt&quot; law, the rural parts of the municipality, outside of the island/town of Vardø, were separated to form the new municipality of &quot;Vardø landdistrikt&quot;. Initially, Vardø landdistrikt had a population of 245. The new municipality was too small to be an official self-governing municipality, and it was not until 22 May 1868 when a royal resolution was passed that officially declared it a self-governing municipality. On 1 January 1874, a small part of Vardø landdistrikt (population: 48) was transferred to the town of Vardø. In 1956, the name was changed to &quot;Båtsfjord&quot;. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the eastern fourth of Båtsfjord (population: 621) was transferred to the neighboring Vardø Municipality.

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Name===
The name was originally &quot;Vardø landdistrikt&quot; (and later &quot;Vardø herred&quot;) which both mean &quot;the rural district of Vardø&quot;, since the municipality surrounded the town of Vardø. On 24 August 1956, a royal resolution changed the name of the municipality to &quot;Båtsfjord&quot;. This new name was chosen because the village of Båtsfjord () was the main population centre of the municipality. The first element is the genitive case of which means &quot;the innermost part of a fjord&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;fjord&quot;. The village is located at the innermost part of a fjord, so the name has a very straightforward meaning.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 19 April 1985. The official blazon is &quot;Azure, a fish hook argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a blue field (background) and the charge is a Stone Age bone fish hook. The fishing hook has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The blue color in the field and the fish hook was chosen for the great economic importance of fishing and fish processing in the municipality. The shape of the hook was derived from ancient Stone Age hooks found in the municipality. The arms were designed by Arvid Sveen after a proposal by Svein Harald Eliassen. 

==Economy==
Fishing permits (for salmon fishing) are sold for use on specific rivers including the Sandfjordelva, Syltefjordelva and Komagelva. A crab processing factory was started in 2015. About 20 to 30 million Norwegian kroner was the cost of investment. It initially employed 28 people.

==Government==
Båtsfjord Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council.

<doc id="178015" wikidata="Q48827" url="?curid=178015" title="Sør-Varanger Municipality">
<text>Sør-Varanger (; ; ) is a municipality in Finnmark county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Kirkenes. Other settlements in the municipality include the villages of Bjørnevatn, Bugøynes, Elvenes, Grense Jakobselv, Hesseng, Jakobsnes, Neiden, and Sandnes. Located west of the Norway–Russia border, Sør-Varanger is the only Norwegian municipality that shares a land border with Russia, with the only legal border crossing at Storskog.

The municipality is the 6th largest by area out of the 357 municipalities in Norway. Sør-Varanger is the 112th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 10,063. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has decreased by 0.3% over the previous 10-year period.

There is a Dark-sky park in Pasvik.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the large Varangerfjorden ( or ), located along the northern shore of the municipality (a neighboring municipality on the north side of the same fjord was Nord-Varanger). The first element is which is the plural genitive case of the word which means &quot;fishing village&quot;. The last element is which means &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;small fjord&quot;. It was first probably used for the narrow fjord on the inside of Angsnes which now is called &quot;Meskfjorden&quot; and leads into Varangerbotn. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Sørvaranger&quot; or &quot;Sydvaranger&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Sør-Varanger&quot;. 

==History==
Prehistoric labyrinth constructions at Holmengrå, were possibly used for religious purposes.

The original inhabitants of the area are the Skolt Sami. This Sami group migrated between coast and inland in present Norwegian, Finnish, and Russian territory long before any borders existed. In the 16th century, they were converted to the Russian Orthodox faith, and still today the chapel of Saint George at Neiden, dating from 1565, is a reminder of eastern influence.

Sør-Varanger became Norwegian in 1826, after having been [part of] a Russian-Norwegian &quot;fellesdistrikt&quot; - a district shared between two countries - that had a small Eastern Sami population group that was under Russian jurisdiction. In 1826, the previously disputed areas were divided between Norway and Russia, causing great difficulties for the Sami. The Norwegian state also invited Norwegian settlers to come to the area, building Lutheran churches to counterbalance the Orthodox heritage, notably the King Oscar II Chapel, located immediately west of the Russian border. The historic border crossing station was at Skafferhullet (which was replaced with the present day station at Storskog).
The King Oscar II Chapel in Grense Jakobselv on the Russian border was built in 1869 to mark the border.

During the 19th century, Finnish settlers (Kven) arrived to the valleys, and since 1906, Norwegians came in large numbers because of the iron mining starting up near Kirkenes. After the Treaty of Tartu the area of Petsamo was ceded to Finland, and Sør-Varanger (and Norway) no longer bordered Russia, until Finland had to cede it back to the Soviet Union in 1944.

In 1906, the Sydvaranger company opened the Bjørnevatn Mine at Bjørnevatn and four years later the mine was connected to the port in Kirkenes by Kirkenes–Bjørnevatn Line, the world&#x27;s most northern railway. The mine was closed in 1996, but re-opened in 2009.

In October 1944, Soviet forces chased Nazi-Germany&#x27;s forces out of the municipality; some inhabitants were living in tunnels (outside Kirkenes) used for the mining industry, when the Soviet forces arrived; at the time Kirkenes was under intense bombing from aircraft.

In a 1944 report to Norway&#x27;s prime minister in exile, a Norwegian government official (&quot;embedsmann &quot;) in Finnmark—Thore Boye—said that Norwegian soldiers had [crop-] cut (&quot;snauklippet&quot;) &quot;25 young girls—some of them married&quot; who had been pointed out by local men, as having had relations with German soldiers&quot;.

===Establishment of municipality===
The municipality of Sør-Varanger was established on 1 July 1858 when the large Vadsø Municipality (population: 1,171) was divided and the part located south of the Varangerfjorden became the new Sør-Varanger municipality. The borders of the municipality have not changed since that time. 

On 1 January 2020, the municipality became part of the newly formed Troms og Finnmark county. Previously, it had been part of the old Finnmark county. On 1 January 2024, the Troms og Finnmark county was divided and the municipality once again became part of Finnmark county.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 16 April 1982. The official blazon is &quot;Per bend rayonny Or and gules&quot; (). This means the arms have a field (background) with a diagonal line in the shape of flames. Above the line, the field has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. Below the line, the field has a tincture of gules (red). The arms show three flames along the division of the field. The division of the shield symbolizes the importance of the number three: The three main sources of income are agriculture, mining, and fishing; the municipality also has three main rivers (Neiden, Pasvikelva, and Jakobselva) that form the borders of Norway, Russia, and Finland; and there are three cultures in the municipality: Norwegians, Finns, and Sami. The arms were designed by Sissel Sildnes.

==Geography==

Sør-Varanger is a vast area of about , situated between Finland and Russia. Most of the area is low-lying forest of pine and birch, with barren sections facing the Barents Sea. The highest point in the municipality is the tall mountain Báhttervárri.

The Varangerfjorden runs along the northern part of the municipality and the Bøkfjorden runs north–south cutting into the municipality and flowing into the Varangerfjorden. The large island of Skogerøya lies on the west side of the Bøkfjorden. Skogerøytoppen is the tallest mountain on Skogerøya. The Bøkfjord Lighthouse lies along the mouth of the Bøkfjorden.

The municipal centre of Sør-Varanger is the town of Kirkenes, located on a peninsula in the Bøkfjorden. Other settlements include Bugøynes, Neiden, and little hamlets along the river of Pasvikelva. The local airport is called Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen which is also a military camp. The Garrison of Sør-Varanger (GSV) is based at Høybuktmoen.

The flora of the area is a part of the Russian and Siberian taiga, including a few hundred spruce trees of the Russian variety. Bears also inhabit the upper valley, notably in the Øvre Pasvik National Park, Øvre Pasvik Landscape Protection Area, and Pasvik Nature Reserve.

Lakes include Ellenvatnet, Gardsjøen, Garsjøen, Klistervatnet, and Ødevatnet. The fjords include Korsfjorden.

===Climate===
Sør-Varanger has a boreal climate (subarctic) with long, cold winters. Summers are short, but can sometimes see warm temperatures.


==Economy==
The service sector is one of the two most important industries related to the city of Kirkenes. Kimek, a company for repair of boats and ships, has 66 employees (as of Q4 2024); the company is one of the largest employers in the municipality - alongside the municipality itself.

As of 2013, 2.8% of the work force in Sør-Varanger are employed in the primary sector.

Cruise ships have in 2022, stopped using the port at Kirkenes; ship owners consider the port to be too close to the [Russian border or] Russia; in 2022 the war between Russia and Ukraine escalated.

The mining company Sydvaranger went bankrupt in 2015 and its mining operations in the municipality does not have a timeframe for a restart (as of 2022), however there are 30 employees preparing for a possible restart; the company was acquired by Tacora Resources Inc (an American corporation) in 2021. In Q2 2024, Grangex completed the purchase of Sydvaranger Mining; case work by the authorities shows planning for 400-500 employees split between the mining complex at Bjørnevatn and the complex in Kirkenes (for processing and moving products onto freighting ships).

A research station at Svanvik (which is part of Norsk institutt for bioøkonomi), has employees of the national government.

==Government==
All municipalities in Norway are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Indre og Østre Finnmark District Court and the Hålogaland Court of Appeal.

That highway heads south into Russia through the Storskog border crossing, the only legal public crossing on the Norway-Russia border.

==Religion==
===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Sør-Varanger. It is part of the Varanger prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland.

==Archaeology==
In 2015 rock carvings, estimatedly dated to 4200–5200 B.C. were found at Tømmerneset on Gamneset, several kilometers outside Kirkenes. The carvings were discovered along an old path used by reindeers—between two crags—by an archaeologist traveling between existing excavation sites at Gamneset. (A planned oil terminal will expectedly shut out the general public, from the site of the carvings.)

==Leisure==
Popular leisure activities include salmon fishing in one of the numerous rivers, hunting for moose and grouse, and snowmobile driving. Many inhabitants also own and frequently use a cabin located in more remote parts of the municipality.

==General information==
The municipality of Ringsaker was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law).

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Ringsaker (population: 16,490) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Furnes (population: 7,288) and Nes (population: 4,184) plus the Hamarsberget and Vikersødegården exclave areas of the municipality of Vang (population: 34) to create the new, larger municipality of Ringsaker. On 1 January 1965, a part of Ringsaker (population: 100) was transferred to the neighboring Hamar Municipality. On 1 January 1967 there was a municipal land swap between Vang and Ringsaker municipalities. The Stav, Valsigsvea, and Arnkvern Nedre areas of Vang (population: 50) was transferred to Ringsaker Municipality and the Stensby and Holmlund areas of Ringsaker (population: 114) was transferred to Vang.

On 1 January 1992, the parts of the Stensby, Hanstad, Viker, and Stammerud areas of Ringsaker (population: 224) were transferred to the neighboring Hamar Municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Ringsaker&quot; farm ( or ) since the first Ringsaker Church was built there. The first element is the genitive case of or which has an unknown meaning. One possibility is that or (&#x27;Lord of the Ring&#x27;) may have been an epithet or alias for the Norse god Ullr, based on a ceremony mentioned in the poem &quot;Atlakviða&quot; where an oath is sworn by (&#x27;the ring of Ullr&#x27;). The last element is which means &quot;acre&quot; or &quot;field&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 1 February 1985. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, an moose statant argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a moose. The moose has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The moose design is inspired by the pre-historic cave paintings found at the Stein farm in Ringsaker, indicating the early inhabitation of the area. The arms were designed by Arne Løvstad. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

==History==
===Harald Hårfagre in 882===
Ringsaker is first mentioned in King Harald Hårfagre&#x27;s Saga, in the Heimskringla by Snorri Sturluson. The saga reports that Harald Hårfagre (872–930) was but ten years old when he succeeded his father (Halfdan the Black). After Halfdan the Black&#x27;s death, many chiefs coveted the dominions he had left. Among these King Gandalf was the first; then Högne and Fróði, sons of King Eystein of Hedemark; and also King Hogne Karuson of Ringerike.

Hake, the son of Gandalf, led an expedition of 300 men against Vestfold. King Harald&#x27;s army, led by Guthorm, met and fought a great battle, and King Harald was victorious, killing king Hake. Then King Harald turned back, but King Gandalf had come to Vestfold so they defeated him also. When the sons of King Eystein in Hedemark heard the news, they proposed to meet at Ringsaker in Hedemark with the remaining kings, Hogne Karuson and Herse Gudbrand. King Harald and Guthorm found out where the Oppland kings were meeting, and coming undetected at night, set fire to the houses in which Hogne Karuson and Herse Gudbrand slept. King Eystein&#x27;s two sons and their men fought, but both Hogne and Frode died.

After the fall of these kings, King Harald had subdued Hedemark, Ringerike, Gudbrandsdal, Hadeland, Thoten, Romerike, and the whole northern part of Vingulmark. In addition, King Gandalf was slain, and King Harald took the whole of his kingdom as far south as the river Raum (Glomma).

===Saint Olaf in 1018===
Ringsaker is again mentioned in a saga about 1018 when Olaf (later Saint Olaf) sent people to advise the Opplands that he was coming, as it was custom for the king to live as guest there every third year. In the autumn, he left Sarpsborg and went first to Vingulmark. He inquired about their Christianity, teaching some and punishing others. He went through that district, and on to Romerike. Christianity was weaker there and he punished all who had not obeyed his word. The king of Romerike proceeded to Ringsaker, to consult King Hrorek of Hedemark. They sent messages to King Gudrod of Gudbrandsdal, and to the King of Hadaland, inviting them to meet at Hedemark. The kings agreed to resist Olaf. They summoned the leaders from their kingdoms, and when they had assembled, the kings directed them to gather warriors. Most approved of the measure, but the kings were betrayed to Olav by Ketil Kavl of Ringanes (the southernmost district in Hedemark, Stange), who proceeded rapidly down lake Mjøsa to Eid, where Olaf was then located.

King Olaf, accompanied by 400 men, arrived at Ringsaker before the next day dawned. Ketil knew where the kings slept, and Olaf had all these houses surrounded. The kings were taken prisoners. King Hrorek&#x27;s eyes were put out. King Gudrod&#x27;s tongue was cut out. King Ring and two others were banished from Norway. King Olaf took possession of the land these kings had possessed, and after this Olaf alone bore the title of king in Norway.

===Sigurd of Røyr in 1163===
Sigurd of Røyr, who was Haakon II&#x27;s champion, lived at Røyr (Rør) in Ringsaker. He died at Re in 1163.

A SOS Children&#x27;s Village has been planned for Ringsaker—Norway&#x27;s second.

<text>Løten is a municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Hedemarken. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Løten. Other villages in the municipality include Ådalsbruk, Heimdal, and Brenneriroa.

The municipality is the 246th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Løten is the 133rd most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 7,836. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 4.8% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==
The parish of &quot;Løiten&quot; was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). The name was later changed to &quot;Løten&quot;. The boundaries of the municipality have never changed.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Løten&quot; farm (). The actual farm is probably the one which is now called &quot;Prestgarden&quot; (meaning &quot;the vicarage&quot;), where the first Løten Church was built. The first element is which means &quot;hollow depression&quot;. (There is a long depression between the &quot;Prestgarden&quot; and the old church.) The last element is which means &quot;meadow&quot; or &quot;pasture&quot;. Historically, the name of the municipality was spelled &quot;Leuten&quot; or &quot;Leuthen&quot;. In 1838 the spelling was changed to &quot;Løiten&quot;. On 3 November 1917, a royal resolution changed the spelling of the name of the municipality to &quot;Løten&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 7 September 1984. The official blazon is &quot;Gules, a drinking horn Or&quot; (). This means the arms have a red field (background) and the charge is a drinking horn from the Middle Ages. The charge has a tincture of Or which means it is commonly colored yellow, but if it is made out of metal, then gold is used. It represents the historical importance of growing wheat and also the products of the modern Løiten Brænderi (Løten distillery), which was established in 1855. The arms were designed by Harald Trætteberg. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has one parish () within the municipality of Løten. It is part of the Hamar domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar.

==History==
There has been traffic from east to west through Løten, throughout all recorded periods of history and archeological evidence supports earlier trade along this route. The old village center was formed around the Løten Church, which was built during the 13th century.

When King Christian IV of Denmark prohibited the importation of German beer in the early 17th Century, distillation began in Norway. In 1624, distilled alcohol was prohibited at weddings, and by 1638 King Christian forbade the clergy the right to distill in their own homes. The corn-growing districts of Løten, Vang (the former municipality in Hedmark), and Romedal all became famous for their distilleries. &quot;Gamle Løiten&quot; from Løiten Brænderi, which was established in 1855, was a highly prized &quot;akvavit&quot; produced in Løten.

When the railway was opened in 1862, Løten Station became the new centre of trade and management. The area around the new station grew up as the present village of Løten.

==Government==
Løten Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Østre Innlandet District Court and the Eidsivating Court of Appeal.

==Geography==

Løten lies in the eastern part of the traditional district of Hedmarken. It is surrounded by Hamar Municipality to the west-northwest, Stange municipality to the west-southwest, and Elverum municipality to the east. Small portions of the municipality border on Åmot in the far north and Våler in the south. The Hedmarksvidda moorland lies in the north.

Løten lies along the &quot;border&quot; between the agricultural wheat fields of the lower part of Eastern Norway (the areas around and south of lake Mjøsa), and the taiga (boreal coniferous forests) that stretch from eastern Norway all the way to Siberia. This border area between the cultivated farm land and the wilderness was written about by the poet Rolf Jacobsen, from Hamar, in his classic poem (&quot;Thoughts at the Ånestad crossroad&quot;).

<text>is a municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is located in the traditional district of Hedemarken. The administrative centre of the municipality is the village of Stangebyen. Other villages include Bekkelaget, Espa, Bottenfjellet, Ilseng, Ottestad, Sandvika, Sinnerud, Starhellinga, Tangen, and Romedal.

The municipality is the 157th largest by area out of the 356 municipalities in Norway. Stange is the 59th most populous municipality in Norway with a population of 21,356. The municipality&#x27;s population density is and its population has increased by 10% over the previous 10-year period.

==General information==

The parish of Stange was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt law). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the neighboring municipalities of Romedal (population: 6,441) and Stange (population: 9,734) were merged to form a new, larger municipality of Stange with a population of 16,175 residents. On 13 July 1956, a small part of the municipality of Vang (population: 24) was transferred to Stange municipality.

===Name===
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old &quot;Stange&quot; farm () since the first Stange Church was built there. The name is the plural form of which means &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;pole&quot;, or &quot;rod&quot;. (The farm is lying on a long hill, and this is probably the background for the name.)

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms was granted on 20 June 1986. The official blazon is &quot;Vert, a plough argent&quot; (). This means the arms have a green field (background) and the charge is a medieval plough called an ard. The charge has a tincture of argent which means it is commonly colored white, but if it is made out of metal, then silver is used. The design symbolizes this historic importance of agriculture in the area; originally the growing of grains and then later growing potatoes. The arms were designed by Arne Løvstad. The municipal flag has the same design as the coat of arms.

===Churches===
The Church of Norway has five parishes () within the municipality of Stange. It is part of the Hamar domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Hamar.

===Media===
The newspaper &quot;Stangeavisa&quot; has been published in Stange since 2004.

==History==
Archeological finds indicate agricultural settlements in the area well before the Viking Age. Since the shortest route from the south to Hamar went through the area, there have also been trade and hospitality there since time immemorial. Stange has its own historical association that publishes articles, short research topics, as well as authoritative works on the area&#x27;s history.

Stange Church is located in Stangebyen. The church is mentioned in 1225 in Håkon Håkonsen&#x27;s saga and the current church building was constructed around the year 1250.

The Atlungstad Distillery was established in Stange in 1855.

==Geography==
The municipality is situated on the east side of the lake Mjøsa. It borders the municipalities of Hamar on the north; Løten, Våler, and Åsnes to the east; Nord-Odal to the south; and Eidsvoll to the west.

The municipality can be roughly divided into two areas: the northern area, with rich and fertile agricultural land; and a southern area with craggy, forested area (the Stange Commons). As a result, the northern section is dominated by large, prosperous farms; the southern part by small, marginal farms. The rivers Lageråa and Svartelva both run through the municipality.

==Government==
Stange Municipality is responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. The municipality is under the jurisdiction of the Østre Innlandet District Court and the Eidsivating Court of Appeal.
