<text>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour is an American comedy and variety show television series hosted by the Smothers Brothers and initially airing on CBS from 1967 to 1969.

The series was a major success, especially considering it was scheduled against the major NBC television series &quot;Bonanza&quot;, with content that appealed to contemporary youth viewership with daring political satire humor and significant popular music performers such as Buffalo Springfield, Pete Seeger, The Beatles, and the Who. Despite this success, continual conflicts with network executives over content led to the show being abruptly pulled from the schedule in violation of the Smothers&#x27; contract in 1969.

==History==
The evolution of The Comedy Hour was unique to a medium that was fearful of change. The show debuted in the winter of 1967 as a slightly &quot;hip&quot; version of the typical comedy-variety show of its era. But within weeks it rapidly evolved into a program that extended the boundaries of what was considered permissible in television satire. The roster of writers and performers included Hal Goldman and Al Gordon (who had written for &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;), Jim Stafford, Steve Martin, Don Novello, Rob Reiner, Lorenzo Music, perennial presidential candidate Pat Paulsen, Bob Einstein (&quot;Officer Judy&quot;), and Leigh French (&quot;Share a Little Tea with Goldie&quot;). The show also introduced audiences to pop singer Jennifer Warnes (originally billed as Jennifer Warren or simply &quot;Jennifer&quot;), who was a regular on the series. The television premiere of Mason Williams&#x27; hit record, &quot;Classical Gas,&quot; took place on the show, and Williams himself received an Emmy for his work as a staff writer; during the show&#x27;s run, Warnes provided vocals for several tracks of Williams&#x27; album, &quot;The Mason Williams Ear Show&quot;.

===Musical guests===
The series showcased new musical artists that other comedy-variety shows rarely gave airtime to, due to the nature of their music or their political affiliations. George Harrison, Joan Baez, Buffalo Springfield, Cass Elliot, Harry Belafonte, Cream, the Who, Donovan, the Doors, Janis Ian, Yank Barry, Jefferson Airplane, Peter, Paul and Mary, Spanky and Our Gang, Steppenwolf, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Ray Charles, Hello People, Pete Seeger and Ike and Tina Turner were showcased during the latter years of the show despite the advertiser-sensitive nature of their music.

Seeger&#x27;s appearance on the season two premiere which aired on September 10, 1967, was his first on network commercial television in 17 years since being blacklisted in 1950. His performance of &quot;Waist Deep in the Big Muddy&quot; was dropped from the broadcast after his refusal to comply with CBS&#x27;s request to remove the sixth verse. The song, its story related to the present by the controversial stanza, was a metaphor for President Lyndon B. Johnson and his Vietnam War policy. Seeger was eventually allowed to reappear on the show to perform the song again on Episode 24 later that season.

In 1968, the show broadcast several promotional films (later known as &quot;music videos&quot;) for the Beatles&#x27; songs &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot; and several songs of the Bee Gees. Before a rowdy crowd at the Los Angeles Forum, Jimi Hendrix dedicated &quot;I Don&#x27;t Live Today&quot; to the Smothers Brothers, as heard on &quot;The Jimi Hendrix Box Set&quot;.

===Controversies and cancellation===
The show became both popular and controversial for those same references to youth culture and the issues that both interested and affected this particular target audience. Whereas most older and more conservative audiences were tuning into shows such as the western &quot;Bonanza&quot;, the younger, more liberal generation—ages 15–25—were watching the Smothers&#x27; more socially relevant humor. However, despite the reputation both brothers earned, Tom Smothers later acknowledged in 2006 that he was in reality the &quot;little bit looser&quot; of the two brothers, stating that he and Dick &quot;still disagree about everything&quot; and even describing Dick as &quot;more conservative politically&quot; and &quot;very pragmatic.&quot;

The brothers soon found themselves in regular conflicts with CBS&#x27; network censors. At the start of the 1968–69 season, the network ordered that the Smothers deliver their shows finished and ready for air ten days before airdate so that the censors could edit the shows as necessary. In the season premiere, CBS deleted an entire segment featuring Belafonte singing &quot;Lord, Don&#x27;t Stop the Carnival&quot; against a backdrop of the havoc during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with two lines from a satire of their main competitor, &quot;Bonanza&quot;. As the year progressed, battles over content continued, including a David Steinberg sermon about Moses and the Burning Bush.

With some local stations making their own deletions of controversial sketches or comments, the continuing problems over the show reached a boiling point after CBS showed a rerun on March 9, 1969. The network explained the decision by stating that because that week&#x27;s episode did not arrive in time to be previewed, it would not be shown. In that program, Joan Baez paid tribute to her then-husband David Harris, who was entering jail after refusing military service, while comedian Jackie Mason made a joke about children &quot;playing doctor.&quot; When the show finally did air, three weeks later, the network allowed Baez to state that her husband was in prison, but edited out the reason.

Despite the conflict, the show was picked up for the 1969–70 season on March 14, seemingly ending the debate over the show&#x27;s status. An episode slated for an April 13 broadcast was refused by CBS because the brothers had brought back Steinberg to perform another sermon routine; the original sermon on October 27, 1968, had been met with hundreds of angry viewer letters. However, the episode was aired in Canada on CTV on a pre-release, which was a common occurrence at that time. Network CEO and president William S. Paley abruptly canceled the show on April 4, 1969, citing the Smothers&#x27; failure to meet the contractual pre-air delivery dates required for local affiliate screening. Another of the network&#x27;s presidents, Robert Wood, stated that it became evident that the brothers &quot;were unwilling to accept the criteria of taste established by CBS.&quot; &quot;Hee Haw&quot; replaced the Smothers Brothers that summer.

This cancelation led the brothers to file a breach of contract suit against the network. On April 6, 1973, after four years of litigation, a federal court ruled in favor of the Smotherses and ordered CBS to pay them US$776,300 (equivalent to $ in ), and in 1975, the duo returned to television, hosting the tamer (and unsuccessful) &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; that aired on NBC.

The show won the Emmy Award that year for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy, Variety or Music.
The story of its cancelation is the subject of a 2002 documentary film, &quot;Smothered: The Censorship Struggles of the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot;.

==Revival==
In February 1970, &quot;The Return of the Smothers Brothers&quot; aired. The hour-long special was written by Tom Smothers, David Steinberg, and Bob Einstein. Guests included Peter Fonda and Glen Campbell.

&quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; was revived for the 1988–89 television season. The revival, which included the return of cast regular Pat Paulsen alongside new performers, lasted one season. The revived &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; began production during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, resulting in the brothers resorting to performing their own material.

In 1993, the series was repackaged for broadcast on the E! Network featuring introductions by the Smothers Brothers and new interview footage by participants in the original series.

==Home media==
In celebration of the 50th Anniversary of The Smothers Brothers, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; was first released on DVD by Time-Life Entertainment with &quot;The Best of Season 3&quot; that features 11 episodes from the third and final season of the show, presented in its uncensored and uncut original broadcast form, including extra features that were never-before-released on DVD. Time Life released a second DVD collection on October 20, 2009, &quot;The Best of Season 2.&quot; Previously, in 2002, Time Life Entertainment released Bravo&#x27;s documentary special, &quot;Smothered: The Censorship Struggles of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; on DVD.

<text>Duel in the Sun is a 1946 American epic psychological Western film directed by King Vidor, produced and written by David O. Selznick, and starring Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Gregory Peck, Lillian Gish, Walter Huston, and Lionel Barrymore. Based on the 1944 novel of the same name by Niven Busch, it follows a young orphaned Mestiza woman who experiences prejudice and forbidden love, while residing with her white relatives on a large Texas ranch.

==Plot==
Pearl Chavez is orphaned after her father Scott Chavez kills her mother, having caught her with a lover. Before Scott Chavez is executed as a punishment for killing his wife, he arranges for his daughter Pearl to live with his second cousin and old sweetheart, Laura Belle in Texas.

Arriving by stagecoach, Pearl is met by Jesse McCanles, one of Laura Belle&#x27;s two grown sons. He takes her to Spanish Bit, their enormous cattle ranch. The gentle and gracious Laura Belle is happy to welcome her to their home, but not so her husband, the Senator Jackson McCanles, who uses a wheelchair. He calls Pearl &quot;a half-breed&quot; and jealously despises Pearl&#x27;s father.

The second son, Lewt, is a ladies&#x27; man with a personality quite unlike that of his gentlemanly brother Jesse. He expresses his interest in Pearl in direct terms and she takes a strong dislike to him. Laura Belle calls in Mr. Jubal Crabbe, the &quot;Sinkiller&quot;, a gun-toting preacher, to counsel Pearl on how to avoid the evils of temptation. Pearl is determined to remain &quot;a good girl&quot;.

When she submits to Lewt&#x27;s aggressive advances one night, Pearl is angry with him and ashamed of her own behavior. But she also cannot help but be flattered by his lust and attentions. Jesse, meanwhile, is ostracized by his father and no longer welcome at the ranch after siding with railroad men, headed by Mr. Langford, against the Senator&#x27;s personal interests. Jesse is in love with Pearl but he leaves for Austin to pursue a political career and becomes engaged to Helen Langford, Langford&#x27;s daughter.

Offended when Lewt reneges on a promise to marry her, Pearl takes up with Sam Pierce, a neighboring rancher who is smitten with her. She does not love him but says yes to his proposal. Before they can be married, however, Lewt picks a fight with Pierce in a saloon and guns him down. He insists that Pearl can belong only to him. Lewt becomes a wanted man.

On the run from the law, Lewt finds time to derail a train and occasionally drop by the ranch late at night and press his attentions on Pearl. She cannot resist her desire for him and lies for Lewt to the law, hiding him in her room. Afterward, he walks out on her, despite her pleas that she loves him.

Laura Belle&#x27;s health takes a turn for the worse and the Senator admits his love for her before she dies. Jesse returns to visit but is too late; his mother is dead. The Senator continues to shun him, as does Lewt, their family feud finally resulting in a showdown. Lewt tosses a gun to his unarmed brother but Jesse stands his ground without attempting to pick it up. Jesse warns that Lewt will eventually be hanged as a murderer, and Lewt responds by shooting Jesse.

The Senator&#x27;s old friend, Lem Smoot, tells him that Jesse&#x27;s wound is not mortal and the old man softens up towards his son and reconciles. Pearl is relieved that Jesse is going to survive. When Helen arrives, she invites Pearl to leave Spanish Bit forever and come live with them in Austin. Pearl agrees, but when she is tipped off by one of the Spanish Bit hands that Lewt intends to come after Jesse again, she arms herself and engages in a shootout with Lewt in the desert. They die in each other&#x27;s arms.

==Cast==
==Themes and analysis==
&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; was released the same year as John Ford&#x27;s film &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; and has been described as taking &quot;the moment of sadism&quot; from Ford&#x27;s film to extremes. Released in the postwar years during a period of economic boom and the changing role of women in society including marriage, sexuality and inclusion in the work force left some Americans feeling alienated. Psychological westerns, popular in the 1940s, featured characters plagued by a dark torment that reflected the post-war attitudes. The march of progress is symbolized by an advancing railroad cutting across a senator&#x27;s cattle lands.

The &quot;civilizing forces&quot; of the American West are represented by the characters of Pearl&#x27;s father, Laura Belle and Jesse, while Lewt and Senator McCanles are constant reminders that she is not part of the white patriarchal order. After being raped by Lewt, Pearl is not able to meet the Victorian-era standards for moral conduct. Her identity as part Indian is &quot;linked to notions of uncontrollable drives, the fading of subjectivity, and the loss of conscious agency&quot;. Believing she encouraged the rape, Jesse ends their romantic relationship. The &quot;dark&quot; or savage element of her sexuality and unrestrained passions has a racial dimension, contrasted with the white feminine ideal in the film&#x27;s imagery, it is something needing to be tamed. She is &quot;too sexual to be a proper wife, too dark to be a comfortable part of [white] society, and too passionate to be controlled with anything but violence&quot;.

As Pearl is already &quot;spoiled&quot; by the rape she no longer needs to control her sexuality and enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with Lewt who treats her viciously and with racist abuse like calling her a &quot;bob-tailed little half-breed&quot;. Marriage with Pearl is out of the question for Lewt due to his father&#x27;s expectations that the family ranch not be &quot;turned into an Injun reservation&quot; though Lewt continues to exhibit jealous, controlling behaviors including attempting to murder his brother Jesse when he makes plans for Pearl to attend school in Austin. While in many ways the typical hero of American westerns, Lewt crosses over into the realm of the &quot;savage&quot; or &quot;uncivilized&quot;. The violence Pearl encounters from Lewt leads her to develop gradually into a femme fatale type character who eventually murders him even as she loves him in order to protect the goodness of Jesse and his fiancée Helen.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was adapted by Oliver H. P. Garrett and David O. Selznick from the novel by Niven Busch.

Busch wrote the novel after working on the script for &quot;The Westerner&quot; which made him convinced he could write a better Western. He went to Arizona to research a book and got the idea for the novel. According to Busch: &quot;The idea was, simply, instead of writing about two guys and wondering how to get a girl in, to write about a girl and let the guys come in as they happened. Having a woman was new, especially a very sexy woman in a family consisting entirely of men. It was dynamite—like the whore and the lighthouse.&quot; Busch said the novel &quot;had great success right off&quot; and &quot;was a huge bestseller in paperback&quot;.
Busch set up the film as producer at RKO and hired Garrett to write the script. John Wayne was going to play Lewt because he had an obligation with the studio. Busch had difficulty casting the female lead. He wanted Veronica Lake; they offered it to Hedy Lamar, who fell pregnant. Busch&#x27;s then-wife Terese Wright did not want to play the role as she felt it did not suit her. Then the role was offered to Jennifer Jones. Her lover (and future husband) David O. Selznick started making a series of demands so RKO&#x27;s head of production Charles Koerner sold the project at a profit to Selznick to produce.

The film proved to be a turbulent experience for Selznick and Vidor, with several directors being left uncredited for their work in the film, such as Josef von Sternberg, William Dieterle, William Cameron Menzies, Otto Brower, Sidney Franklin and Selznick himself. Production unit managers Glenn Cook and William McGarry were also uncredited.

Busch said Selznick &quot;had deteriorated a lot. He was taking sleeping pills at night and benzedrine by day. And he was beginning to get very sloppy and very arrogant. Then he tried to hoist Vidor out of there&quot;.

===Filming===
&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; had a protracted filming process that lasted approximately a year and a half, with principal photography beginning March 1, 1945, and concluding in September 1946. The film was largely shot in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. The train derailment scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California, using a combination of a real train and large scale models.

==Release==
===Censorship===
As shot, the film could not make it past the Hays Code censors or religious review boards and so was heavily edited by state censor boards while several states (mostly in the South but also in New England) refused to license the film. It was nicknamed &quot;Lust in the Dust&quot;, which eventually became the name of another film. A scene in which Pearl does a seductive dance for Lewton was cut from the film before it was released.

===Box office===

&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; had its world premiere in Los Angeles on December 31, 1946 at the Egyptian Theatre. It opened in New York City on May 8, 1947. The film was shown at increased admission prices which boosted its earnings to $8.7 million in rentals in the United States and Canada during its initial release, making it the highest-grossing film of 1947.

Because of the film&#x27;s huge production costs, rumored to be over $6,000,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in ), its $2,000,000 advertising campaign (unheard of at the time) and Selznick&#x27;s costly distribution tactics, the film only broke even.

===Critical reaction===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;For, despite all his flashy exploitation, Mr. Selznick can&#x27;t long hide the fact that his multimillion-dollar Western is a spectacularly disappointing job... Those are also harsh words about a picture which promises very much and which, even for all its disappointments, has some flashes of brilliance in it. But the ultimate banality of the story and its juvenile slobbering over sex (or should we say &quot;primitive passion&quot;, as says a ponderous foreword?) compels their use.&quot; William Brogdon of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a favorable review: &quot;As a production it adds no class distinction to David O. Selznick but assures him a top commercial success. The star lineup is impressive. Vastness of the western locale is splendidly displayed in color by mobile cameras. Footage is overwhelmingly expansive, too much so at times considering its length.&quot;

&quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; deemed the film as a glorified&#x27; Western, produced on an immense scale. Its theme is tragic love-making, with tragic consequences...Some of the photographic shots are extremely effective; they make the film look immense.&quot; Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;a picture of terrific in fact, well-nigh bewildering impact. It embodies a strange tragical drama of love, hate and death, set against wild western desert wastes and mesas and fierce mountain fastnesses. Historical in pattern, the narrative, as told on the screen, seems to draw from the most elemental sources, with few of its characters that are not, at times, motivated by the most primitive and even brutal impulses. A tremendously strong production, lurid and violent in the handling of many of its scenes, it still possesses a bigness of design which commands appreciation and respect.&quot;

In an interview, Niven Busch (author of the original novel) said:Great showmanship. It had a few good scenes, and it had a big expansive canvas. It wasn’t the way I would have made the picture. But I took the money and ran. It sold a lot of books for me, so why should I complain? It was an extravaganza rather than realistic. There were more people in the charge down to the railroad than there were in Texas at that time. But what a grand piece of panorama. It did not have the quality of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, but it had the same kind of scope.

===Awards and nominations===
===Home media===
The film never received a LaserDisc release, though 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment did issue a VHS edition of the film. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on DVD in 1999 in a standard edition, followed by a &quot;Roadshow Edition&quot; (featuring its original theatrical musical overture, narration, and outro) in 2001.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Home Entertainment released a subsequent DVD edition on May 25, 2004. The film was released for the first time on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber (in the &quot;Roadshow Edition&quot;) on August 15, 2017.

==Legacy==
The film was one of the first to be honored by a record album, featuring selections from Dimitri Tiomkin&#x27;s musical score. Rather than use excerpts from the soundtrack, RCA Victor recorded some of the music with the Boston Pops Orchestra conducted by Arthur Fiedler. The music was split into approximately three-minute sections and released on 10-inch (254-mm) 78-rpm discs in 1946. A musical prelude lasting nine and a half minutes as well as a two-minute overture preceded the film with Tiomkin conducting the studio orchestra; this recording was later issued on LP and CD.

&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; was first shown on American television on ABC on January 23, 1972.

Martin Scorsese has stated to James Lipton on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; that this was the first film he saw and holds it in high regard. He mentioned it in his documentary of American films. David Stratton has also stated a similar high opinion of the film, at the ACMI&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Flicks&quot; on March 10, 2010. He first saw the film at the age of six.

When explaining the aesthetic of NFL Films, Steve Sabol would point to the climax where Jennifer Jones climbs a mountain. King Vidor uses extreme closeups of her sweating face and bloody hands, and Sabol felt it &quot;would be a great way to show pro football.&quot;

Many of the film&#x27;s plot points (such as the Pearl/Lewt/Sam love triangle) were reused in the Hindi film &quot;Janbaaz&quot; (1986). In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor&#x27;s career.

&quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; was remade as &quot;Saiyan&quot; in Hindi and was released in 1951.

<text>To Each His Own is a 1946 American romantic drama film directed by Mitchell Leisen and starring Olivia de Havilland, Mary Anderson, Roland Culver and John Lund. It was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Charles Brackett and Jacques Théry. A young woman bears a child out of wedlock and has to give him up.

De Havilland won the Academy Award for Best Actress. Brackett was nominated for Best Writing, Original Story. The title song became a hit.

==Plot==
In World War II London, fire wardens Josephine &quot;Jody&quot; Norris and Lord Desham keep vigil and bond over being lonely, middle-aged people. While Desham is arranging dinner plans, a man from Jody’s hometown turns up and tells her that someone from their town is arriving at the train station. Overjoyed, she rushes to the station and runs into a young woman who is waiting for her pilot beau, which sends Jody into a flashback.

Jody is the belle of her small American hometown of Piersen Falls. Both Alec Piersen and traveling salesman Mac Tilton propose to her, but she turns them down. Alec marries Corinne, his second choice. When handsome US Army Air Service fighter pilot Captain Bart Cosgrove flies in to promote a World War I bond drive, he and Jody fall in love, though they have only one night together.

Later, a pregnant Jody is secretly visiting a doctor in New York and is advised that her life is in danger and she needs an operation. She agrees, though she would lose her unborn child. When she learns that Bart has been killed in action, she changes her mind and secretly gives birth to their son in 1919. She tries to arrange it so that she can &quot;adopt&quot; the boy without scandal, but the scheme backfires. Corinne loses her own newborn that same day but is consoled by Jody&#x27;s. Jody loves her son, named Gregory or &quot;Griggsy&quot;, from afar.

Jody&#x27;s father dies, forcing her to sell the family drugstore. When Jody asks to become Griggsy&#x27;s live-in nurse, Corinne turns her down. Agitated, Jody reveals that she is Griggsy&#x27;s mother. Knowing that her husband never loved her, Corinne is determined to keep the one person who does.

Jody moves to New York City to work for Mac and discovers that he is a bootlegger, using a cosmetics business as a front. The same day, the place is raided by the police, leaving Mac with nothing but the cosmetics equipment. Jody persuades him to make cold cream; with her drive and determination, she builds a thriving business, and they become rich.

In 1924, she forces Corinne to give her Griggsy by threatening to block a bank loan for Alec&#x27;s failing business. After two months, however, Jody has not revealed her identity to Griggsy, and the boy is miserably homesick. When she attempts to tell him that she is his mother, Griggsy begins crying at the mention of his adoption, which Corinne has already discussed with him. Jody gives up and sends him back to Corinne and Alec.

Heartbroken, Jody leaves the US to immerse herself in work, running the English branch of her Lady Vyvyan Cosmetics Company. During World War II, her son becomes a pilot in the 8th Air Force. When he gets a leave in London, Jody meets his train and fusses over him, arranging for him and his WREN fiancée, Liz, the young woman she bumped into, to stay at her apartment and go out on the town. Griggsy tells Jody that he and Liz have been struggling to get married all day, as England requires a 15-day delay. Because they cannot be married, he will end his leave early.

Lord Desham, who is attracted to Jody, arrives at her apartment and finds her despondent over the fact that Griggsy will not be staying the week in London. She also lets out that she is his mother. Using his influence, Desham arranges for the young man to marry his fiancée without the customary delay. After some broad hints from Desham and musing from his new wife, Lieutenant Piersen realizes why Jody has been so helpful and asks his mother, by that title, for a dance.

==Adaptation==
The film inspired the Indian writer Sachin Bhowmick to work on a script thematically similar to &quot;&quot;To Each His Own &quot;&quot; later on it was filmed as &quot;Aradhana&quot; (1969) and went to become one of the most successful films in Hindi cinema, The film is considered as milestone in Rajesh Khanna&#x27;s career. The film was remade in Turkish as &quot;Kadın Asla Unutmaz&quot; also, directed by Orhan Aksoy which released in same year.

Aradhana was remade in Telugu as &quot;Kannavari Kalalu&quot; and in Tamil as Sivagamiyin Selvan.

==Critical reception==

Alt Film Guide said &quot;&quot;To Each His Own&quot; is surprisingly direct in its handling of an unwed mother, paralleling Jody&#x27;s increasing coldness with the detached—but honest—flashbacks that comprise the bulk of the film.&quot; One reviewer at Cinescene said &quot;In &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, the sufferer is able to learn something from her mistakes and misfortunes, growing past her grief and distress into a kind of wisdom. The picture has style, but also a sincerity of sentiment that gives it distinction.&quot; Another wrote, &quot;Forthrightly feminist avant la lettre, the film is conscious of constraints, but committed to its movement forward: less resentful than resourceful, and more stalwart than strident, yet angry and determined nonetheless.&quot;

ClassicFilmGuide deemed it &quot;A marvelous sentimental (and now dated) story &quot;. JigsawLounge wrote &quot;Brackett&#x27;s screenplay is a wonder of intricate construction, with pretty much every minor detail of character and plot introduced for a reason which &#x27;pays off&#x27; much later in the script. On sober reflection, it is a rather tall tale—and more than the usual degree of disbelief-suspension may be required here and there. But this should prove a very simple task for all but the most hard-headed of audiences: &quot;To Each His Own&quot;&#x27;s combination of emotional resonance and a lively wit is potent, and enduring.&quot; San.beck said, &quot;This maudlin drama explores the loneliness of a woman who is successful in business but has only one relative she rarely sees. The world wars made for some quick marriages and many widows.&quot; NicksFlickPicks gave the film a rating of 3 stars out of 5. &quot;TV Guide&quot; said, &quot;What might have been a trite soap opera is elevated to the status of superior emotional drama by a wise script, sensitive direction, and an Oscar-winning performance by de Havilland.&quot;

<text>Deception Island is in the South Shetland Islands close to the Antarctic Peninsula with a large and usually &quot;safe&quot; natural harbor, which is occasionally affected by the underlying active volcano. This island is the caldera of an active volcano, which seriously damaged local scientific stations in 1967 and 1969. The island previously held a whaling station. It is now a tourist destination with over 15,000 visitors per year. Two research stations are operated by Argentina and Spain during the summer season. While various countries have asserted sovereignty, it is still administered under the Antarctic Treaty System, meaning it is under no control.

== Geography ==
Located within the Bransfield Strait, the island is roughly circular and horseshoe-shaped, with a maximum diameter around . The highest peak, Mount Pond on the east side of the island, has an elevation of , while Mount Kirkwood on the west has an elevation of . Over half (57%) of the island is covered by glaciers up to 10 m thick, ice-cored moraines, or ice-covered pyroclasts. The centre of the island has been flooded by the sea to form a large bay, now called Port Foster, about long and wide. The bay has a narrow entrance, just wide, called Neptune&#x27;s Bellows. The port is a basin with a flat floor up to deep with several small submarine cones and domes. The port is rimmed by a shallow coastal shelf with sandy-gravelly beaches. The outer coast of the island is characterized by cliffs of rock or ice.

Raven&#x27;s Rock, a navigation hazard, lies below the water in the middle of the channel. Just inside Neptune&#x27;s Bellows lies the cove Whalers Bay, which is bordered by a large black sand beach. Several maars line the inside rim of the caldera, with some containing crater lakes (including one named Crater Lake). Others form bays within the harbour, such as the wide Whalers Bay. Other features of the island include Mount Kirkwood, Fumarole Bay, Sewing-Machine Needles, Telefon Bay, and Telefon Ridge.

The linear Costa Recta spanning most of the east coast is hypothesised to be a scarp of a retreated submarine fault.

A 2016 study on Ardley Island, to the northeast, examined lake guano sediments and studied penguin population dynamics over 7,000 years. Three of five population growth phases were terminated by a sudden crash, due to volcanic eruptions from the active volcano of Deception Island.
The history of volcanic eruptions is still under investigation, but several larger eruptions happened in the last 10,000 years.

==Geology==

Deception Island is the exposed portion of an active shield volcano 30 km in diameter. The island is associated with Bransfield Basin seafloor spreading that includes a volcanic ridge and seamounts dating back to the Pleistocene. Deception Island volcanic ash layers have been found on other South Shetland Islands, the Bransfield Strait, the Scotia Sea and in South Pole ice cores. Volcanic tremors are common, originating from depths less than 10 km. Historical eruptions occurred in 1839–1842, 1967, 1969, and 1970. Stratigraphy of the island is characterized by the pre-caldera Port Foster Group and the post-caldera Mount Pond Group, both within the Deception Island Volcanic Complex. The Port Foster Group&#x27;s principal outcrops are located at South Point, Cathedral Crags near Entrance Point and north of Punta de la Descubierta forming spectacular coastal cliffs along the western portion of the island. The group is composed of the Fumarole Bay Formation consisting of hydrovolcanic tephra, the Basaltic Shield Formation consisting of lavas and Strombolian scoria, and the Outer Coast Tuff Formation consisting of lapilli-tuffs. The Mount Pond Group dominates the surface geology and consists of the pyroclastic Baily Head and Pendulum Cove formations, both formed during hydrovolcanic eruptions, and the Stonethrow Ridge Formation consisting of tuff cone and maar deposits. The caldera collapsed as either a hydrovolcanic eruption of the Outer Coast Tuff Formation, releasing about 30 cubic kilometers of magma, or passively due to regional tectonics, since the island is at the intersection of the Bransfield Strait rift and the orthogonal Hero fracture zone.

== History ==
The first authenticated sighting of Deception Island was by the British sealers William Smith and Edward Bransfield from the brig &quot;Williams&quot; in January 1820. It was first visited and explored by the American sealer Nathaniel Palmer on the sloop &quot;Hero&quot; the following summer, on 15 November 1820. He remained for two days, exploring the central bay. Palmer named it &quot;Deception Island&quot; on account of its outward deceptive appearance as a normal island, when the narrow entrance of Neptune&#x27;s Bellows revealed it rather to be a ring around a flooded caldera.

Palmer was part of an American sealing fleet from Stonington, Connecticut, under the command of Benjamin Pendleton, consisting of 6 ships. Port Fisher was used as their operational base from 1820 to 1821. Palmer met Bellingshausen close to the island in Jan. 1821, during the First Russian Antarctic Expedition.

A lighthouse named Surgidero Iquique was built on the island to guide vessels into Deception Station.

=== Whaling and sealing ===

Over the next few years, Deception became a focal point of the short-lived fur-sealing industry in the South Shetlands. The industry began with a handful of ships in the 1819–1820 summer season, rising to nearly a hundred in 1821–1822. While the island did not have a large seal population, it was a perfect natural harbour, mostly free from ice and winds, and a convenient rendezvous point. Some men likely lived ashore in tents or shacks for short periods during the summer, though no archaeological or documentary evidence survives to confirm this. Massive overhunting meant that the fur seals neared extinction in the South Shetlands within a few years, and the sealing industry collapsed as quickly as it had begun. Deception was abandoned again in approximately 1825.

Sealing captain Robert Fildes charted Port Foster in 1820–1821, which in 1829 became the first published Antarctica nautical chart.

In 1829, the British Naval Expedition to the South Atlantic under the command of Captain Henry Foster in stopped at Deception. The expedition conducted a topographic survey and scientific experiments, particularly pendulum and magnetic observations. A watercolour made by Lieutenant Kendall of the &quot;Chanticleer&quot; during the visit may be the first image made of the island. A subsequent visit by the American elephant-sealer &quot;Ohio&quot; in 1842 reported the first recorded volcanic activity, with the southern shore &quot;in flames&quot;.

The second phase of human activity at Deception began in the early 20th century. In 1904, an active whaling industry was established at South Georgia, taking advantage of new technology and an almost untouched population of whales to make rapid profits. It spread south into the South Shetland Islands, where the lack of shore-based infrastructure meant that the whales had to be towed to moored factory ships for processing; these needed a sheltered anchorage and a plentiful supply of fresh water, both of which could be found at Deception. In 1906, the Norwegian-Chilean whaling company Sociedad Ballenera de Magallanes started using Whalers Bay as a base for a single ship, the &quot;Gobernador Bories&quot;.

Other whalers followed, with several hundred men resident at Deception during the Antarctic summers and as many as 13 ships operating in peak years. In 1908, the British government formally declared the island to be part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies, thus under British control, establishing postal services and appointing a magistrate and customs officer for the island. The magistrate was to ensure that whaling companies were paying appropriate licence fees to the Falklands government and ensuring adherence to catch quotas. A cemetery was built in 1908, a radio station in 1912, a hand-operated railway also in 1912, and a small permanent magistrate&#x27;s house in 1914. 
The cemetery, by far the largest in Antarctica, held graves for 35 men along with a memorial to 10 more presumed drowned.

These were not the only constructions; as the factory ships of the period were only able to strip the blubber from whales and could not use the carcasses, a permanent on-shore station was established by the Norwegian company Hvalfangerselskabet Hektor A/S in 1912 – up to an estimated 40% of the available oil was being wasted by the ship-based system. This was the only successful shore-based industry ever to operate in Antarctica, reaping high profits in its first years. A number of exploring expeditions visited Deception during these years, including the Wilkins-Hearst expedition of 1928, when a Lockheed Vega was flown from a beach airstrip on the first successful flights in Antarctica.

The development of pelagic whaling in the 1920s, where factory ships fitted with a slipway could tow aboard entire whales for processing, meant that whaling companies were no longer tied to sheltered anchorages. A boom in pelagic Antarctic whaling followed, with companies now free to ignore quotas and escape the costs of licences. This rapidly led to overproduction of oil and a collapse in the market, and the less profitable and more heavily regulated shore-based companies had trouble competing. In early 1931, the Hektor factory finally ceased operation, ending commercial whaling at the island entirely.

=== Scientific research ===
On 16 November 1928, Hubert Wilkins made the first Antarctic flight from a Whalers Bay ash runway.

Deception remained uninhabited for a decade, but was revisited in 1941 by the British auxiliary warship HMS &quot;Queen of Bermuda&quot;, which destroyed the oil tanks and some remaining supplies to ensure it could not be used as a German supply base. In 1942, an Argentine party aboard the &quot;Primero de Mayo&quot; visited and left signs and painted flags declaring the site Argentine territory; the following year, a British party with returned to remove the signs.

In 1944, a British expedition under Lieutenant James Marr established a short-lived base on Deception Island as part of Operation Tabarin, which was carried out during the Second World War to deny safe anchorages to enemy raiding vessels and to gather meteorological data for allied shipping in the South Atlantic. It also had the effect of strengthening British claims to the Falkland Island Dependencies that had begun being challenged by Argentina and Chile. Operation Tabarin would deny use of the area to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, which was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points, and address a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands. Following the end of the war, the research begun by Operation Tabarin continued in subsequent years, ultimately becoming the British Antarctic Survey.

In February 1953, as part of a post-war British effort to exert sovereignty over its claimed Antarctic territories, landed a party of Royal Marines on Deception Island to destroy an Argentinian and a Chilean military base; an action known as the Deception Island incident.

In 1961, Argentina&#x27;s president Arturo Frondizi visited the island to show his country&#x27;s interest. Regular visits were made by other countries operating in the Antarctic, including the 1964 visit of the US Coast Guard icebreaker , which ran aground inside the harbour.

However, the volcano returned to activity in 1967 and 1969, destroying the existing scientific stations. Both British and Chilean stations were demolished, and the island was again abandoned for several years. The final major volcanic eruption was reported by the Russian Bellingshausen station on King George Island and the Chilean station Arturo Prat on Greenwich Island; both stations experienced major falls of ash on 13 August 1970.
In 2000, there were two summer-only scientific stations, the Spanish Gabriel de Castilla Base and the Argentine Decepción Station.

Remains of previous structures at Whalers Bay include rusting boilers and tanks, an aircraft hangar, and the British scientific station house (Biscoe House), with the middle torn out by the 1969 mudflows. A bright orange derelict airplane fuselage, which is that of a de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter that belonged to the Royal Air Force, was recovered in 2004. Plans to restore the airplane and return it to the island have been made.

The Russian cruise ship ran aground at Deception Island on 27 November 2006. She was towed off by the Spanish Navy icebreaker &quot;Las Palmas&quot; and made her own way to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. She later became a ghost ship in the North Atlantic after the towing line parted during an operation to scrap the vessel in the Dominican Republic.

==Tourism==
The first commercial cruise ship arrived in January 1966. By 1999, over 10,000 tourists had visited the island.

==Research stations==

===Aguirre Cerda ===

President Pedro Aguirre Cerda Station was a Chilean Antarctic base, located at Pendulum Cove on Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands, inaugurated in 1955. It was evacuated in December 1967 when volcanic eruptions forced the evacuation of the base.

===Deception ===
Deception Station is an Argentine base located at Deception Island. The station was founded on 25 January 1948 and was a year-round station until December 1967, when volcanic eruptions forced the evacuation of the base. Since then, it has been inhabited only during the summer.

===Gabriel de Castilla===

Gabriel de Castilla Base is a Spanish research station located on Deception Island. The station was constructed in 1990.

===Gutiérrez Vargas Refuge===
The Gutiérrez Vargas Refuge, named after an aviation captain who died on 30 December 1955, was located at from Aguirre Cerda Station and was inaugurated on 12 February 1956. Its purpose was to serve as a refuge for the members of the station in case of fire. On 4 December 1967 the refuge was definitively abandoned, as was the Aguirre Cerda Station, due to a violent volcanic eruption. The remains of the refuge structure can still be seen on the beach where it was located.

===Station B===

In early 1944, a party of men from Operation Tabarin, a British expedition, established a permanent scientific base named Station B. This was occupied until 5 December 1967, when an eruption forced a temporary withdrawal. It was used again between 4 December 1968 and 23 February 1969, when further volcanic activity caused it to be abandoned.

== Environment ==

Deception Island has become a popular tourist stop in Antarctica because of its several colonies of chinstrap penguins, as well as the possibility of making a warm bath by digging into the sands of the beach.

After the Norwegian Coastal Cruise Liner ran aground off the coast of Deception Island on 30 January 2007, fuel from the ship washed into a bay. Ecological damage has not yet been determined. On 4 February 2007, the Spanish Gabriel de Castilla research station on Deception Island reported that water and sand tests were clean, and that they had not found signs of the oil, estimated as ).

Deception Island exhibits some wildly varying microclimates. Near volcanic areas, the air can be as hot as , and water temperature can reach .

=== Antarctic specially protected areas ===
Eleven terrestrial sites have been collectively designated as an Antarctic specially protected area (ASPA 140), primarily for their botanic and ecological values, because the island has the greatest number of rare plant species of any place in the Antarctic. This is largely due to frequent volcanic activity creating new substrates for plant colonisation:
* Collins Point (site A) contains good examples of long-established vegetation, with high species diversity and several rarities.
* Crater Lake (site B) has a scoria-covered lava tongue with a diverse cryptogamic flora, and exceptional development of turf-forming mosses.
* An unnamed hill at the southern end of Fumarole Bay (site C) has several rare species of mosses that have colonised the heated soil crust close to a line of volcanic vents.
* Fumarole Bay (site D) is geologically complex with the most diverse flora on the island.
* West Stonethrow Ridge (site E) supports several rare mosses, liverworts, and lichens.
* Telefon Bay (site F) has all its surfaces dating from 1967, thus allowing accurate monitoring of colonisation by plants and animals.
* Pendulum Cove (site G) is another known-age site being colonised by mosses and lichens.
* Mount Pond (site H) contains exceptional moss, liverwort, and lichen communities.
* Perchue Cone (site J) is an ash and cinder cone with rare mosses.
* Ronald Hill to Kroner Lake (site K) is another known-age site being colonised by numerous cryptogam species, and with a unique algal community on the lake shore.
* South East Point (site L) supports the most extensive population of Antarctic pearlwort known in the Antarctic region.

In addition, two marine sites in Port Foster have collectively been designated ASPA 145, to protect their benthic communities.

=== Important bird area ===
Baily Head, a prominent headland forming the easternmost extremity of the island, has been identified as an important bird area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a very large breeding colony of chinstrap penguins (100,000 pairs). The IBA comprises the ice-free headland and about of beach on either side of it. Other birds known to nest at the site include brown skuas, Cape petrels, and snowy sheathbills.

<text>Sister Kenny is a 1946 American biographical film about Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian bush nurse, who fought to help people who suffered from polio, despite opposition from the medical establishment. The film stars Rosalind Russell, Alexander Knox, and Philip Merivale.

The film was adapted by Alexander Knox, Mary McCarthy, Milton Gunzburg (uncredited), and Dudley Nichols from the book &quot;And They Shall Walk&quot;, by Elizabeth Kenny and Martha Ostenso, and directed by Dudley Nichols.

==Plot==
In 1911, Elizabeth Kenny returns from nursing school in Brisbane, Australia, to her home in the bush of Queensland. Her mentor, Dr. McDonnell, is chief at the nearest hospital, 50 miles away. He wants her to work with him, but she wants to be a bush nurse. He says she will not last six months. Three years later, Elizabeth visits a ranch to treat a young girl, Dorrie, who is contorted in agony. She describes the symptoms in a telegram to McDonnell. His reply: infantile paralysis, no known treatment, &quot;do the best you can with the symptoms...” Elizabeth treats “spasming” muscles with heat, wrapping Dorrie in steaming flannel. After the contractions subside, Dorrie cannot move her legs or sit up. Through close observation, Elizabeth realizes that she is not paralyzed. Her muscles have become “alienated”. After her muscles are “re-educated”, Dorrie makes a complete recovery, as do five other cases of polio that Elizabeth treats.

Elizabeth takes Dorrie to see McDonnell. She assumes that she has done the usual thing in treating polio and is horrified to learn that infantile paralysis is a deadly, crippling disease and that the standard treatment is agonizing immobilization. McDonnell believes that Elizabeth has discovered an entirely new way of treating polio. He takes her to Dr. Brack, the most senior expert. Brack scoffs at her theory and refuses to consider the possibility that the science of the past 50 years may be wrong. When Dorrie does cartwheels, Brack contends that she never had polio.

McDonnell suggests that Elizabeth treat the patients that doctors have given up on. At that time, Australian nurses had to be single; she is about to marry Captain Kevin Connors. Elizabeth&#x27;s clinic shuts down. She took 12 “paralyzed” patients, and seven walked out. Doctors argue that they never had polio. Kevin leaves to fight in World War I. Elizabeth joins the Army and finds him in a hospital at the front.

She returns to Australia with the rank of Sister to wait for Kevin. Then she reads about an outbreak in Townsville, and goes there. Kevin appears. She has written to him, ending their engagement. She does not think she will ever be done with polio. Kevin watches as she talks to a new patient and leaves without another word.

In the 1920s, Sister Kenny heads to Brisbane. Some time later, the Elizabeth Kenny Clinic is being closed. She confronts Dr. Brack while he is lecturing on polio to a group of orthopedists. Brack invites her to speak and then belittles her and her treatment. One of the doctors is from the Queensland Health Department. He invites her to his office. Another interested orthopedist arrives, followed by McDonnell. They have been working on getting a Royal Commission to investigate the Kenny treatment. She has an invitation from England. She feels hopeless, but a crowd outside cheers for her.

She travels around Europe, becoming famous. Kevin meets her at Croydon airport. He is glad it turned out this way. He hands her a paper with news of the Munich Agreement.

The Royal Commission condemns her. Reviews of her book are scathing. However, all the younger men are using the Kenny Treatment, whether they call it that or not. In America, she is “given the runaround”. Out of money, she plans to go home. A reporter reads her a press release from the University of Minnesota, stating that the Kenny method will form the basis of all future treatment. She is wanted in Minneapolis, where there is a polio epidemic. After three years&#x27; work in Minneapolis, Sister Kenny dictates a letter to Dr. McDonnell. A national committee is about to report on her work in the U.S. She is about to lecture to orthopedic surgeons. The new book is out. She receives three honorary degrees. A cable arrives: Dr. McDonnell has died.

The lecture hall is full. The medical director of the institute introduces her. The news broadcast of the committee report is piped in. It is devastating. Furious, the director points to the real results. The lecture continues. At the end, a crowd of children gather outside the Institute, singing “Happy Birthday” to Sister Kenny.

==Reception==
The film recorded a loss of $660,000 for RKO.

Box office returns were disappointing even in Australia. It flopped in Brisbane, Kenny&#x27;s hometown.

<text>Tommy James (born Thomas Gregory Jackson; April 29, 1947) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. James is the frontman of the rock band Tommy James and the Shondells, which is known for hit singles such as &quot;Mony Mony&quot;, &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; and &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Born in Dayton, Ohio on April 29, 1947, James later moved with his family to Niles, Michigan. He was a child model at the age of four. 

==Career==
===Tommy James and the Shondells===

In 1959, at the age of twelve, James formed the band &quot;The Echoes&quot;, which eventually became &quot;Tom and the Tornadoes&quot;. In 1964, the band changed its name to The Shondells. That same year, Jack Douglas, a local DJ at WNIL radio station in Niles, formed his own record label, Snap Records. The Shondells were one of the local bands he recorded at WNIL Studios. One of the songs was the Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich ditty &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, which the pair had recorded under the name The Raindrops. The song was a hit locally, but the label had no resources for national promotion, and it was soon forgotten.
In 1965, a local dance promoter, Bob Mack, found a copy of &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; in a used record bin and started playing it at his Pittsburgh dance clubs. Soon after, a Pittsburgh area bootlegger made a copy of the song and began pressing copies of it, speeding it up slightly in the process. Sales of the bootleg were estimated at 80,000 in ten days. It became a number one on Pittsburgh radio stations in early 1966. Douglas heard about the record&#x27;s sudden popularity in Pittsburgh because his name and contact information appeared on Snap Records labels. Numerous calls from Pittsburgh convinced James to go to Pennsylvania, where he met Mack and Chuck Rubin, who handled the talent bookings for Mack&#x27;s dance clubs. Before long, all three major music trade papers, &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Cashbox&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot;, were listing &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; as a regional breakout hit. Rubin, who had music industry connections, said it was a good time for the trio to travel to New York City in search of a record deal.

The band made the rounds of the major recording labels, getting initial potential offers from most companies they visited. One label, Roulette Records, gave no initial response because its head, Morris Levy, was out of town until that evening; Roulette was one of the last stops on their visit. By the next morning, Mack, Rubin, and James were now receiving polite refusals from the major record companies after the enthusiasm for the record the day before. James said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t know what in the world was going on, and finally Jerry Wexler over at Atlantic leveled with us and said, &#x27;Look, Morris Levy and Roulette called up all the other record companies and said, &quot;This is my freakin&#x27; record.&quot; (laughs) and scared &#x27;em all away – even the big corporate labels.&#x27;&quot; Their only option would be to sign with Roulette.

Since the band had broken up two years before, James was the only Shondell left. Mack made his dance club bands available to James, but nothing seemed to fit until one of the bands&#x27; guitarists took James to the Thunderbird Lounge in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. James sang with the house band, the Raconteurs. The Raconteurs became the new Shondells, and Jackson acquired the professional name of Tommy James. By the third week of June 1966, &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; had become the top single at WLS. By the third week of July 1966, &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; had become the top single in the United States.

After a few comings and goings of members, the classic lineup of James, Eddie Gray (guitar), Mike Vale (bass), Ron Rosman (keyboards) and Pete Lucia (drums) was formed. The group recorded a follow-up song to &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;. When Bob Mack&#x27;s attempt at finding some Shondells worked out in an inadvertent way, he told James about another record he found in the same used record bin &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; came from: &quot;Say I Am&quot; by Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs. The only thing James and his new Shondells were aware of when they entered the recording studio for the first time is that whatever they recorded should sound similar to &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, although the two songs sound nothing alike. Mack played The Fireballs record for the group, and they decided to record their version of the song. Mack was credited as the producer for the group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;.

Songwriter Richie Cordell wrote (or co-wrote) and produced many of the group&#x27;s hits, among them &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;, &quot;Mirage&quot;, and &quot;Mony Mony&quot;. The creation of &quot;Mony Mony&quot; was a group effort involving Cordell, James, Shondells band member Peter Lucia, producer Bo Gentry, and Bobby Bloom. James and Cordell set out to create a party rock single, working out everything except the song&#x27;s title, which eluded them even after much effort. When they took a break from their creative endeavors on James&#x27; apartment terrace, they looked up at the Mutual of New York Insurance Company&#x27;s large neon sign bearing the abbreviation for the company: M-O-N-Y, which provided the song&#x27;s name.

Tommy James and the Shondells also produced a &quot;Mony Mony&quot; video when the song was a hit. Even though a number of musical groups had already produced videos by that time, there was no market at all for that film in the US. Television stations would not air it, and it was originally shown between double features in movie theaters in Europe. The film was not seen in the US until the creation of MTV.

James was contacted by Beatle George Harrison, who was working with a group called Grapefruit at the time. Harrison and the group had written some songs they wanted James to consider recording. Since the group had made a decision to change their musical style (and would do so with &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;: see below) and the material Harrison and Grapefruit provided was in the style of &quot;Mony Mony&quot;, James turned down their offer.

The music business changed after the success of &quot;Mony Mony&quot;. Top 40 program formatting, based on 45 RPM single records, drove popular music on the radio. Few stations played cuts from record albums, so radio was, in effect, &quot;selling&quot; single records for the record companies. In August 1968, James and the Shondells went on the campaign trail for three months with presidential candidate Vice President Hubert Humphrey. Meanwhile, popular music had become album-driven, displacing many performers whose singles had been top sellers. James realized he and the Shondells needed to become an album-oriented group if they were to survive in the business, necessitating a change in their style.

After working out a marketing strategy for their new sound, James visited WLS when the group was in Chicago to play a concert, bringing along a rough cut of &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; to the station. WLS secretly recorded the music when James played his tape for them. By the time James was out of the building and in the car, its radio was playing the station&#x27;s dub of the not-yet-finished song. &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; had to be pressed the way it was heard on the radio station, and the marketing plan was now wasted time and effort.

&quot;Crimson and Clover&quot; was a huge success, and the group would have two follow-up hits that also reached the Hot 100&#x27;s top 10, &quot;Sweet Cherry Wine&quot; and &quot;Crystal Blue Persuasion&quot;. James, who co-wrote all three of those songs (with Peter Lucia, Richie Grasso, and Eddie Gray &amp; Mike Vale, respectively), and his band did well enough with the transition to be invited to perform at Woodstock. James describes Artie Kornfeld&#x27;s invitation like this: &quot;Artie was up and asked if you could play at this pig farm up in upstate New York.&quot; I said, &quot;What?!?&quot; &quot;Well, they say it&#x27;s gonna be a lot of people there, and it&#x27;s gonna be a really important show.&quot; At the time James was in Hawaii and was incredulous about being asked to travel 6,000 miles to play a show on an upstate New York pig farm, telling the Roulette Records&#x27; secretary Karin Grasso, &quot;If I&#x27;m not there, start without us, will you please?&quot;

In March 1970, after four more hits, drugs almost killed James when, at a concert, he collapsed, and was pronounced dead. However, he survived, decided to take a break from the recording studio, and moved up into the country to recuperate. The Shondells, without James, recorded two albums under the new group name Hog Heaven (one &quot;self titled&quot; on Roulette Records in 1970 and the second in 1971 but unreleased until 2008), but disbanded soon afterwards.

In October 2008, James and the three surviving members of the original Shondells (Pete Lucia died in 1987) reunited in a New Jersey studio to record again after 37 years. The group recorded an album, &quot;I Love Christmas&quot;.

Tommy James and The Shondells were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends online Hall of Fame in 2006. Four of the band&#x27;s biggest hits have been voted Legendary Michigan Songs: &quot;Crimson &amp; Clover&quot; in 2010, and &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;, and &quot;Mony Mony&quot; in 2011.

===Solo career===
James recorded the Tony Romeo composition, &quot;Indian Lake&quot; which found its way onto a PPX release, backed with an Addrisi Brothers composition which had reached #39 on the Hot 100 for The Association, &quot;Time for Livin&#x27;&quot;.

Having gone solo in 1970, he released his first two solo albums on Roulette, &quot;Tommy James&quot; (September 1970) and &quot;Christian of the World&quot; (August 1971). He had two further Billboard Hot 100 top 20 chart hits with &quot;Draggin&#x27; the Line&quot; (co-written by Bob King) (#4 in 1971) and &quot;Three Times in Love&quot; (#19 in 1980), plus eleven much smaller Hot 100 chartings. &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; has been James&#x27; one RIAA certified gold single. He also wrote and produced the million-selling 1970 hit &quot;Tighter, Tighter&quot; for the group Alive &#x27;N Kickin&#x27; (co-written by Bob King). 

It was evident when James first met Morris Levy of Roulette Records that Levy was willing to strong-arm others when necessary. While a Roulette artist had great creative control when recording for the company, the lack of payment for those efforts was difficult to take. James estimates the company owed him $30 to $40 million in royalties. Roulette was used as a front for organized crime, also functioning as a money laundering operation, as Levy was closely allied with the Genovese crime family. In the early 1970s, the Genovese outfit found itself in a bloody gang war with the Gambino family, which saw victims not only among mobsters (such as Levy&#x27;s close friend and business partner Thomas Eboli), but increasingly among non-mob figures on the periphery of the organizations. Levy had taken a somewhat fatherly shine to James, and worried that he might be a target for those who wanted to get at the Genovese family through Levy, so he warned James to flee New York for an extended period until the war was over. In 1971, James settled in Nashville, Tennessee, where the Mafia had little presence or influence. While there, he recorded an album with top Nashville musicians entitled &quot;My Head, My Bed and My Red Guitar&quot; (January 1972), which received critical acclaim but sold poorly. He left Roulette Records in 1974 and two more albums, &quot;In Touch&quot; (July 1976) and &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; (January 1978), followed on Fantasy Records, with yet another, &quot;Three Times in Love&quot;, appearing on Millennium Records in late 1979. The independent label Aegis Records put out his &quot;Hi-Fi&quot; album in the summer of 1990.

To date, over 300 musicians have recorded versions of James&#x27; music. Covers of three of James&#x27; songs went top ten on the Hot 100 (the last two as consecutive No. 1s) in the 1980s: Joan Jett with &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, Tiffany with &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot;, and Billy Idol with &quot;Mony Mony&quot;.

===Other endeavors===
In February 2010, James published an autobiography entitled &quot;Me, The Mob, and The Music&quot;. James announced that deals were in hand to turn the story into both a film and a Broadway play. Barbara De Fina was said to be producing the film. James did not feel comfortable writing his book until all those deeply involved with the record company had died. After Roulette Records and Levy&#x27;s Big Seven Music publishing company were sold (the record company to an EMI and Rhino Records partnership, the music publishing company to Windswept Pacific Music, which was later sold to EMI) James began to receive large royalty checks from sales of his records.

In February 2018, James became host of weekly radio program &#x27;Gettin Together with Tommy James&#x27; on Sirius XM Radio channel 73, 60s Gold.

James can also be seen on late-night informercials selling collections of music from the Woodstock era for Time Life.

==Personal life==
James moved to Clifton, New Jersey in the mid 1970s and circa 2000 to nearby Cedar Grove. He has been married three times and has one child. On February 23, 2022, his wife Lynda died after a prolonged illness.

<doc id="183749" wikidata="Q878070" url="?curid=183749" title="Duty">
<text>A duty (from &quot;due&quot; meaning &quot;that which is owing&quot;; , past participle of ; , whence &quot;debt&quot;) is a commitment or expectation to perform some action in general or if certain circumstances arise. A duty may arise from a system of ethics or morality, especially in an honor culture. Many duties are created by law, sometimes including a codified punishment or liability for non-performance. Performing one&#x27;s duty may require some sacrifice of self-interest.

A sense-of-duty is also a virtue or personality trait that characterizes someone who is diligent about fulfilling individual duties or who confidently knows their calling. A sense-of-duty can also come from a need to fulfill familial pressures and desires. This is typically seen in a militaristic or patriotic way.

Cicero, an early Roman philosopher who discusses duty in his work &quot;On Duties&quot;, suggests that duties can come from four different sources:
# as a result of being a human
# as a result of one&#x27;s particular place in life (one&#x27;s family, one&#x27;s country, one&#x27;s job)
# as a result of one&#x27;s character
# as a result of one&#x27;s own moral expectations for oneself

The specific duties imposed by law or culture vary considerably, depending on jurisdiction, religion, and social normalities.

==Civic duty==

Duty is also often perceived as something owed to one&#x27;s country (patriotism), or to one&#x27;s homeland or community. Civic duties could include:
* Obey the law
* Pay taxes
* Provide for a common defense, should the need arise
* Enroll to vote, and vote at all elections and referendums (unless there is a reasonable excuse such as a religious objection, being overseas, or illness on polling day)
* Serve on a jury, if called upon
* Go to the aid of victims of accidents and street crime and testifying as a witness later in court
* Report contagious illnesses or pestilence to public-health authorities
* Volunteer for public services (e.g. life-saving drills)
* Donate blood periodically or when needed
* Give time to voice advice on a relevant field of expertise, benefits, workplace improvements and on how it is conducted or run
* Revolt against an unjust government

==Duties of employment==
Specific obligations arise in the services performed by a minister of a church, by a soldier, or by any employee or servant.

Examples:
* Dereliction of duty is an offense in U.S. military law
* Duty to protect, in medicine
* &quot;In loco parentis&quot;, for schools
* Professional responsibility for lawyers and accountants

==Legal duties==
Examples of legal duties include:
* Duty of care
* Duty of candour
* Duty to defend and duty to settle, in insurance
* Duty to pay tax (for instance: import duty)
* Duty to rescue
* Duty to retreat
* Duty to report a felony
* Duty to vote (in countries with mandatory voting)
* Duty to warn
* Fiduciary duties
* Duty to care for children as legal guardian (opposite of child neglect)
* Special duties created by a contract
* &quot;In loco parentis&quot; (duty like a parent to child towards nonhuman entities, such as animals, river, environment, etc. e.g. by treating them as legal person.

==Filial duty==
In most cultures, children are expected to take on duties in relation to their families. This may take the form of behaving in such a way that upholds the family&#x27;s honor in the eyes of the community, entering into arranged marriages that benefit the family&#x27;s status, or caring for ailing relatives.

This family-oriented sense of duty is a particularly central aspect to the teachings of Confucius, and is known as , or filial piety. As such, the duties of filial piety have played an enormous role in the lives of people in eastern Asia for centuries. For example, the painting &quot;Lady Feng and the Bear&quot;, from ancient China, depicts the heroic act of a consort of the emperor placing herself between her husband and a rampaging bear. This is meant to be taken as an example of admirable filial behavior.

Filial piety is considered so important that in some cases, it outweighs other cardinal virtues: In a modern example, &quot;concerns with filial piety of the same general sort that motivate women to engage in factory work in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and elsewhere in Asia are commonly cited by Thai prostitutes as one of their primary rationales for working in the skin trade&quot;. The importance of filial piety can be expressed in this quote from the &quot;Analects&quot; of Confucius: &quot;Yu Tzu said, &#x27;It is rare for a man whose character is such that he is good as a son and obedient as a young man to have the inclination to transgress against his superiors; it is unheard of for one who has no such inclination to be inclined to start a rebellion. The gentleman devotes his efforts to the roots, for once the roots are established, the Way will grow there from. Being good as a son and obedient as a young man is, perhaps, the root of a man&#x27;s character&#x27;&quot;.

==In various cultures==
Duty varies between different cultures and continents. Duty in Asia and Latin America is commonly more heavily weighted than in Western culture. According to a study done on attitudes toward family obligation:
Asian and Latin American adolescents possessed stronger values and greater expectations regarding their duty to assist, respect, and support their families than their peers with European backgrounds.

The deeply rooted tradition of duty among both Asian and Latin American cultures contributes to much of the strong sense of duty that exists in comparison to western cultures. Michael Peletz discusses the concept of duty in his book &quot;Gender, Sexuality, and Body Politics in Modern Asia&quot;:
Notions of filial duty … are commonly invoked to mobilize the loyalties, labor power, and other resources children in the ostensible interests of the household and, in some cases, those of the lineage clan as a whole. Doctrines of filial piety … attuned to them may thus be a source of great comfort and solace to the elders but they can also be experienced as stressful, repressive, or both by those who are enjoined to honor their parents’ (and grandparents’) wishes and unspoken expectations.

An arranged marriage is an example of an expected duty in Asia and the Middle East. In an arranged marriage relating to duty, it is expected that the wife will move in with the husband&#x27;s family and household to raise their children. Patrilocal residence is usual; rarely does the man move in with the woman, or is the married couple allowed to start their own household and life somewhere else. They need to provide for the entire family in labor and care for the farms and family. Older generations rely on help from their children&#x27;s and grandchildren&#x27;s families. This form of duty is keeping the lineage of a family intact and obliging to the needs of elders.

== Philosophical perspectives ==

=== Epictetus ===
In his &quot;Discourses&quot;, Epictetus employs the analogy of the human foot to elucidate the moral significance of duty: &quot;Do you not know, that as a foot is no longer a foot if it is detached from the body, so you are no longer a man if you are separated from other men.&quot; Just as a human foot may sometimes get dirty or pierced by thorns in service to the body, individuals must also fulfil their roles, even if it entails facing sickness, perilous journeys, or premature death. Epictetus states, &quot;It is your duty then, since you are come here, to say what you ought, to arrange these things as it is fit.&quot;

=== Marcus Aurelius ===
Marcus Aurelius extensively discusses duty in his &quot;Meditations,&quot; in a way that can be summarised using a key section from Book VIII:It is thy duty to order thy life well in every single act; and if every act does its duty, as far as is possible, be content; and no one is able to hinder thee so that each act shall not do its duty.- But something external will stand in the way.- Nothing will stand in the way of thy acting justly and soberly and considerately.- But perhaps some other active power will be hindered.- Well, but by acquiescing in the hindrance and by being content to transfer thy efforts to that which is allowed, another opportunity of action is immediately put before thee in place of that which was hindered, and one which will adapt itself to this ordering of which we are speaking.Similar to Epictetus, he emphasises the importance of duty for humans beings in their social dimension, but goes further by grounding duty in rationality. Marcus traces the origins of social obligation through a logical progression, viewing duty as stemming from the shared human capacity to reason: &quot;which commands us what to do, and what not to do; if this is so, we are fellow-citizens; if this is so, we are members of some political community.&quot; This connection between reason and duty is highlighted too in Book VI, where he states: &quot;I do my duty: other things trouble me not; for they are either things without life, or things without reason, or things that have rambled and know not the way.&quot;

In fact, earlier in the &quot;Meditations&quot;, Marcus expresses concern about the decline of cognitive abilities with age as it affects the fulfilment of duty, noting that &quot;the conception of things and the understanding of them cease first,&quot; which weakens &quot;the power of making use of ourselves, and filling up the measure of our duty.&quot; He also urges readers to derive their sense of duty from within, rather than from external pressures, encouraging them to &quot;stand erect; not be kept erect by others&quot; and to &quot;Labour not unwillingly, nor without regard to the common interest&quot;. Marcus repeatedly comes back to duty as a concept grounded in the human mind, but he does not ignore its social component, advising the reader to accept help, just as a lame solder ought to when fulfilling his duty to climb the battlements during a siege. 

=== Nietzsche ===
Friedrich Nietzsche is among the fiercest critics of the concept of duty. &quot;What destroys a man more quickly&quot;, he asks, &quot;than to work, think, and feel without inner necessity, without any deep personal desire, without pleasure—as a mere automaton of &#x27;duty&#x27;?&quot;

Nietzsche claims that the task of all higher education is &quot;to turn men into machines&quot;. The way to turn men into machines is to teach them to tolerate boredom. This is accomplished, Nietzsche says, by means of the concept of duty.

The writings of Arthur Schopenhauer, including &quot;On the Basis of Morality&quot;, greatly influenced Nietzsche. These influences led Nietzsche to undertake a series of inversions, challenging the idea that morality stemmed from &quot;compassion or sympathy.&quot; Instead, Nietzsche asserted that morality was rooted in life&#x27;s self-overcoming through the will to power. As part of these inversions, Nietzsche explored concepts like &quot;duty&quot; and &quot;pity&quot;, previously discussed by Immanuel Kant and Schopenhauer respectively.

=== Ayn Rand ===
Ayn Rand, a youthful admirer of Nietzsche, anchored her morality against Kant&#x27;s notion of duty. &quot;In a deontological theory, all personal desires are banished from the realm of morality; a personal desire has no moral significance, be it a desire to create or a desire to kill. For example, if a man is not supporting his life from duty, such a morality makes no distinction between supporting it by honest labor or by robbery. If a man wants to be honest, he deserves no moral credit; as Kant would put it, such honesty is &#x27;praiseworthy,&#x27; but without &#x27;moral import.&#x27;&quot;

<text>A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input number is prime. Among other fields of mathematics, it is used for cryptography. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do not generally give prime factors, only stating whether the input number is prime or not. Factorization is thought to be a computationally difficult problem, whereas primality testing is comparatively easy (its running time is polynomial in the size of the input). Some primality tests prove that a number is prime, while others like Miller–Rabin prove that a number is composite. Therefore, the latter might more accurately be called &quot;compositeness tests&quot; instead of primality tests.

== Simple methods ==
The simplest primality test is &quot;trial division&quot;: given an input number, formula_1, check whether it is divisible by any prime number between 2 and formula_2 (i.e., whether the division leaves no remainder). If so, then formula_1 is composite. Otherwise, it is prime. For any divisor formula_4, there must be another divisor formula_5, and a prime divisor formula_6 of formula_7, and therefore looking for prime divisors at most formula_2 is sufficient.

For example, consider the number 100, whose divisors are these numbers:

:1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100.

When all possible divisors up to formula_1 are tested, some divisors will be discovered &quot;twice&quot;. To observe this, consider the list of divisor pairs of 100:

:formula_10.

Products past formula_11 are the reverse of products that appeared earlier. For example, formula_12 and formula_13 are the reverse of each other. Further, that of the two divisors, formula_14 and formula_15. This observation generalizes to all formula_1: all divisor pairs of formula_1 contain a divisor less than or equal to formula_18, so the algorithm need only search for divisors less than or equal to formula_18 to guarantee detection of all divisor pairs.

Also, 2 is a prime dividing 100, which immediately proves that 100 is not prime. Every positive integer except 1 is divisible by at least one prime number by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Therefore the algorithm need only search for &quot;prime&quot; divisors less than or equal to formula_18.

For another example, consider how this algorithm determines the primality of 17. One has formula_21, and the only primes formula_22 are 2 and 3. Neither divides 17, proving that 17 is prime. For a last example, consider 221. One has formula_23, and the primes formula_24 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Upon checking each, one discovers that formula_25, proving that 221 is not prime.

In cases where it is not feasible to compute the list of primes formula_26, it is also possible to simply (and slowly) check all numbers between formula_27 and formula_18 for divisors. A rather simple optimization is to test divisibility by 2 and by just the odd numbers between 3 and formula_18, since divisibility by an even number implies divisibility by 2.

This method can be improved further. Observe that all primes greater than 3 are of the form formula_30 for a nonnegative integer formula_31 and formula_32. Indeed, every integer is of the form formula_30 for a positive integer formula_31 and formula_35. Since 2 divides formula_36, and formula_37, and 3 divides formula_38 and formula_39, the only possible remainders mod 6 for a prime greater than 3 are 1 and 5. So, a more efficient primality test for formula_1 is to test whether formula_1 is divisible by 2 or 3, then to check through all numbers of the form formula_42 and formula_43 which are formula_26. This is almost three times as fast as testing all numbers up to formula_18.

Generalizing further, all primes greater than formula_46 (c primorial) are of the form formula_47 for formula_48 positive integers, formula_49, and formula_50 coprime to formula_46. For example, consider formula_52. All integers are of the form formula_53 for formula_48 integers with formula_55. Now, 2 divides formula_56, 3 divides formula_57, and 5 divides formula_58. Thus all prime numbers greater than 30 are of the form formula_53 for formula_60. Of course, not all numbers of the form formula_47 with formula_50 coprime to formula_46 are prime. For example, formula_64 is not prime, even though 17 is coprime to formula_65.

As formula_66 grows, the fraction of coprime remainders to remainders decreases, and so the time to test formula_1 decreases (though it still necessary to check for divisibility by all primes that are less than formula_66). Observations analogous to the preceding can be applied recursively, giving the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

One way to speed up these methods (and all the others mentioned below) is to pre-compute and store a list of all primes up to a certain bound, such as all primes up to 200. (Such a list can be computed with the Sieve of Eratosthenes or by an algorithm that tests each incremental formula_69 against all known primes formula_70). Then, before testing formula_1 for primality with a large-scale method, formula_1 can first be checked for divisibility by any prime from the list. If it is divisible by any of those numbers then it is composite, and any further tests can be skipped.

A simple but inefficient primality test uses Wilson&#x27;s theorem, which states that formula_73 is prime if and only if:

:formula_74

Although this method requires about formula_73 modular multiplications, rendering it impractical, theorems about primes and modular residues form the basis of many more practical methods.

== Heuristic tests ==
These are tests that seem to work well in practice, but are unproven and therefore are not, technically speaking, algorithms at all.
The Fermat test and the Fibonacci test are simple examples, and they are effective when combined. John Selfridge has conjectured that if &quot;p&quot; is an odd number, and &quot;p&quot; ≡ ±2 (mod 5), then &quot;p&quot; will be prime if both of the following hold:
* 2&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;),
* &quot;f&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1 ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;),
where &quot;fk&quot; is the &quot;k&quot;-th Fibonacci number. The first condition is the Fermat primality test using base 2.

In general, if &quot;p&quot; ≡ a (mod &quot;x&quot;2+4), where &quot;a&quot; is a quadratic non-residue (mod &quot;x&quot;2+4) then &quot;p&quot; should be prime if the following conditions hold:

* 2&quot;p&quot;−1 ≡ 1 (mod &quot;p&quot;),
* &quot;f&quot;(&quot;1&quot;)&quot;p&quot;+1 ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;),

&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;k&quot; is the &quot;k&quot;-th Fibonacci polynomial at &quot;x&quot;.

Selfridge, Carl Pomerance and Samuel Wagstaff together offer $620 for a counterexample.

== Probabilistic tests ==
Probabilistic tests are more rigorous than heuristics in that they provide provable bounds on the probability of being fooled by a composite number.
Multiple popular primality tests are probabilistic tests. These tests use, apart from the tested number &quot;n&quot;, some other numbers &quot;a&quot; which are chosen at random from some sample space; the usual randomized primality tests never report a prime number as composite, but it is possible for a composite number to be reported as prime. The probability of error can be reduced by repeating the test with several independently chosen values of &quot;a&quot;; for two commonly used tests, for &quot;any&quot; composite &quot;n&quot; at least half the &quot;a&quot;″s detect &quot;n&quot;″s compositeness, so &quot;k&quot; repetitions reduce the error probability to at most 2−&quot;k&quot;, which can be made arbitrarily small by increasing &quot;k&quot;.

The basic structure of randomized primality tests is as follows:

#Randomly pick a number &quot;a&quot;.
#Check equality (corresponding to the chosen test) involving &quot;a&quot; and the given number &quot;n&quot;. If the equality fails to hold true, then &quot;n&quot; is a composite number and &quot;a&quot; is a &quot;witness&quot; for the compositeness, and the test stops.
#Get back to the step one until the required accuracy is reached.

After one or more iterations, if &quot;n&quot; is not found to be a composite number, then it can be declared probably prime.

=== Fermat primality test ===
The simplest probabilistic primality test is the Fermat primality test (actually a compositeness test). It works as follows:

:Given an integer &quot;n&quot;, choose some integer &quot;a&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot; and calculate &quot;an&quot; − 1 modulo &quot;n&quot;. If the result is different from 1, then &quot;n&quot; is composite. If it is 1, then &quot;n&quot; may be prime.

If &quot;an&quot;−1 (modulo &quot;n&quot;) is 1 but &quot;n&quot; is not prime, then &quot;n&quot; is called a
pseudoprime to base &quot;a&quot;. In practice, if
&quot;an&quot;−1 (modulo &quot;n&quot;)
is 1, then &quot;n&quot; is usually prime. But here is a counterexample:
if &quot;n&quot; = 341 and &quot;a&quot; = 2, then
: formula_76
even though 341 = 11·31 is composite. In fact, 341 is the smallest pseudoprime base 2 (see Figure 1 of

There are only 21853 pseudoprimes base 2 that are less than 2.5 (see page 1005 of ). This means that, for &quot;n&quot; up to 2.5, if &quot;2n&quot;−1 (modulo &quot;n&quot;) equals 1, then &quot;n&quot; is prime, unless &quot;n&quot; is one of these 21853 pseudoprimes.

Some composite numbers (Carmichael numbers) have the property that &quot;an&quot; − 1 is 1 (modulo &quot;n&quot;) for every &quot;a&quot; that is coprime to &quot;n&quot;. The smallest example is &quot;n&quot; = 561 = 3·11·17, for which &quot;a560&quot; is 1 (modulo 561) for all &quot;a&quot; coprime to 561. Nevertheless, the Fermat test is often used if a rapid screening of numbers is needed, for instance in the key generation phase of the RSA public key cryptographic algorithm.

=== Miller–Rabin and Solovay–Strassen primality test===
The Miller–Rabin primality test and Solovay–Strassen primality test are more sophisticated variants, which detect all composites (once again, this means: for &quot;every&quot; composite number &quot;n&quot;, at least 3/4 (Miller–Rabin) or 1/2 (Solovay–Strassen) of numbers &quot;a&quot; are witnesses of compositeness of &quot;n&quot;). These are also compositeness tests.

The Miller–Rabin primality test works as follows:
Given an integer &quot;n&quot;, choose some positive integer &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. Let 2&quot;s&quot;&quot;d&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − 1, where &quot;d&quot; is odd. If

:formula_77
and
:formula_78 for all formula_79

then &quot;n&quot; is composite and &quot;a&quot; is a witness for the compositeness. Otherwise, &quot;n&quot; may or may not be prime.
The Miller–Rabin test is a strong probable prime test (see PSW page 1004).

The Solovay–Strassen primality test uses another equality: Given an odd number &quot;n&quot;, choose some integer &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, if

:formula_80, where formula_81 is the Jacobi symbol,

then &quot;n&quot; is composite and &quot;a&quot; is a witness for the compositeness. Otherwise, &quot;n&quot; may or may not be prime.
The Solovay–Strassen test is an Euler probable prime test (see PSW page 1003).

For each individual value of &quot;a&quot;, the Solovay–Strassen test is weaker than the Miller–Rabin test. For example, if &quot;n&quot; = 1905 and &quot;a&quot; = 2, then the Miller-Rabin test shows that &quot;n&quot; is composite, but the Solovay–Strassen test does not. This is because 1905 is an Euler
pseudoprime base 2 but not a strong pseudoprime base 2 (this is illustrated in Figure 1 of PSW).

=== Frobenius primality test ===
The Miller–Rabin and the Solovay–Strassen primality tests are simple and are much faster than other general primality tests. One method of improving efficiency further in some cases is the Frobenius pseudoprimality test; a round of this test takes about three times as long as a round of Miller–Rabin, but achieves a probability bound comparable to seven rounds of Miller–Rabin.

The Frobenius test is a generalization of the Lucas probable prime test.

=== Baillie–PSW primality test ===
The Baillie–PSW primality test is a probabilistic primality test that combines a Fermat or Miller–Rabin test with a Lucas probable prime test to get a primality test that has no known counterexamples. That is, there are no known composite &quot;n&quot; for which this test reports that &quot;n&quot; is probably prime. It has been shown that there are no counterexamples for &quot;n&quot; formula_82.

=== Other tests ===
Leonard Adleman and Ming-Deh Huang presented an errorless (but expected polynomial-time) variant of the elliptic curve primality test. Unlike the other probabilistic tests, this algorithm produces a primality certificate, and thus can be used to prove that a number is prime. The algorithm is prohibitively slow in practice.

If quantum computers were available, primality could be tested asymptotically faster than by using classical computers. A combination of Shor&#x27;s algorithm, an integer factorization method, with the Pocklington primality test could solve the problem in formula_83.

== Fast deterministic tests ==
Near the beginning of the 20th century, it was shown that a corollary of Fermat&#x27;s little theorem could be used to test for primality. This resulted in the Pocklington primality test. However, as this test requires a partial factorization of &quot;n&quot; − 1 the running time was still quite slow in the worst case. The first deterministic primality test significantly faster than the naive methods was the cyclotomy test; its runtime can be proven to be O((log &quot;n&quot;)&quot;c&quot; log log log &quot;n&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the number to test for primality and &quot;c&quot; is a constant independent of &quot;n&quot;. A number of further improvements were made, but none could be proven to have polynomial running time. (Running time is measured in terms of the size of the input, which in this case is ~ log &quot;n&quot;, that being the number of bits needed to represent the number &quot;n&quot;.) The elliptic curve primality test can be proven to run in O((log &quot;n&quot;)6), if some conjectures on analytic number theory are true. Similarly, under the extended Riemann hypothesis, the deterministic Miller&#x27;s test, which forms the basis of the probabilistic Miller–Rabin test, can be proved to run in Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)4). In practice, this algorithm is slower than the other two for sizes of numbers that can be dealt with at all. Because the implementation of these two methods is rather difficult and creates a risk of programming errors, slower but simpler tests are often preferred.

In 2002, the first provably unconditional deterministic polynomial time test for primality was invented by Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena. The AKS primality test runs in Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)12) (improved to Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)7.5) in the published revision of their paper), which can be further reduced to Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)6) if the Sophie Germain conjecture is true. Subsequently, Lenstra and Pomerance presented a version of the test which runs in time Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)6) unconditionally.

Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena suggest a variant of their algorithm which would run in Õ((log &quot;n&quot;)3) if Agrawal&#x27;s conjecture is true; however, a heuristic argument by Hendrik Lenstra and Carl Pomerance suggests that it is probably false. A modified version of the Agrawal&#x27;s conjecture, the Agrawal–Popovych conjecture, may still be true.

== Complexity ==
In computational complexity theory, the formal language corresponding to the prime numbers is denoted as PRIMES. It is easy to show that PRIMES is in Co-NP: its complement COMPOSITES is in NP because one can decide compositeness by nondeterministically guessing a factor.

In 1975, Vaughan Pratt showed that there existed a certificate for primality that was checkable in polynomial time, and thus that PRIMES was in NP, and therefore in . See primality certificate for details.

The subsequent discovery of the Solovay–Strassen and Miller–Rabin algorithms put PRIMES in coRP. In 1992, the Adleman–Huang algorithm reduced the complexity to , which superseded Pratt&#x27;s result.

The Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test from 1983 put PRIMES in QP (quasi-polynomial time), which is not known to be comparable with the classes mentioned above.

Because of its tractability in practice, polynomial-time algorithms assuming the Riemann hypothesis, and other similar evidence, it was long suspected but not proven that primality could be solved in polynomial time. The existence of the AKS primality test finally settled this long-standing question and placed PRIMES in P. However, PRIMES is not known to be P-complete, and it is not known whether it lies in classes lying inside P such as NC or L. It is known that PRIMES is not in AC0.

== Number-theoretic methods ==
Certain number-theoretic methods exist for testing whether a number is prime, such as the Lucas test and Proth&#x27;s test. These tests typically require factorization of &quot;n&quot; + 1, &quot;n&quot; − 1, or a similar quantity, which means that they are not useful for general-purpose primality testing, but they are often quite powerful when the tested number &quot;n&quot; is known to have a special form.

The Lucas test relies on the fact that the multiplicative order of a number &quot;a&quot; modulo &quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot; − 1 for a prime &quot;n&quot; when &quot;a&quot; is a primitive root modulo n. If we can show &quot;a&quot; is primitive for &quot;n&quot;, we can show &quot;n&quot; is prime.

<text>Jane Wyman ( ; born Sarah Jane Mayfield; January 5, 1917 – September 10, 2007) was an American actress. A star of both movies and television, she received an Academy Award for Best Actress, four Golden Globe Awards and nominations for two Primetime Emmy Awards. In 1960 she received stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for both motion pictures and television. She was the first wife of future President Ronald Reagan.

According to studio biographies Jane Wyman made her theatrical film debut in &quot;The Kid from Spain&quot; (1932) as an uncredited chorus girl. Wyman always maintained that she got her start in 1934 at 17 dancing in the chorus for LeRoy Prinz at Paramount Pictures. In 1936 Bryan Foy signed Wyman, at 19 years old, to her first studio contract with Warner Bros. During her tenure there, Wyman began appearing in bit roles but progressed into supporting roles, including &quot;My Love Came Back&quot; (1940), &quot;Footlight Serenade&quot; (1942), and &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot; (1943).

By 1945, Wyman emerged as a prominent A-list actress with successful releases in &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946), &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948), &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950), &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951), &quot;So Big&quot; (1953), &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1954), and &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955). She received four nominations for Academy Award for Best Actress between 1946 and 1954, winning one for &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948).

In 1955, Wyman transitioned into television, forming her own production company Lewman Productions Ltd. (co-owned with MCA Inc.). She was also made the producer, host, and frequent star of the last three seasons of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fireside Theatre&quot;, which was rebranded with Wyman&#x27;s name. Her career declined shortly after, and she went into virtual retirement for several intervals of the 1960s and 1970s. 

Wyman&#x27;s career resurged when she appeared on the primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1981–1990), portraying the villainous matriarch Angela Channing. She retired in 1993, after appearing in an episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;. Wyman died from natural causes in 2007, at the age of 90.

== Early life ==

Sarah Jane Mayfield was born on January 5, 1917, in St. Joseph, Missouri, to Gladys Hope (&quot;&quot; Christian; 1891–1960) and Manning Jeffries Mayfield (1895–1922). Her father was a meal company laborer and her mother was a doctor&#x27;s stenographer and office assistant. Wyman was an only child. Her birth parents were married in March, 1916 in Jackson County, Missouri. The 1920 census showed her to be three years old on January 15, 1920, and living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

In October 1921, her parents divorced and her father died unexpectedly three months later. After his death, her mother moved to Cleveland, Ohio, leaving her to be reared by neighbours, Emma (née Reiss) and Richard D. Fulks, the chief of detectives in Saint Joseph. She took their surname unofficially, including in her school records and on her marriage certificate to first husband Ernest Wyman. The Fulks’ had two older children who were sometimes referenced as siblings.

Her unsettled family life resulted in few pleasurable memories. Wyman later said, &quot;I was raised with such strict discipline that it was years before I could reason myself out of the bitterness I brought from my childhood.&quot;

In 1928, aged 11, she moved to Southern California with her foster mother. In 1930, the two moved back to Missouri, where Sarah Jane attended Lafayette High School in Saint Joseph. That same year, she began a radio singing career, calling herself Jane Durrell and adding three years to her birthdate to work legally because she was under-aged.

After dropping out of Lafayette High School in 1932 at age 15, she returned to Hollywood, taking on odd jobs as a manicurist and a switchboard operator.

==Career==
===1932–1936: Early years in Hollywood===


Jane Wyman began her 60-year show business career as an extra on &quot;The Kid from Spain&quot; (1932), &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot; (1933), &quot;Elmer, the Great&quot; (1933), and &quot;Harold Teen&quot; (1934). She had taken classes with Edward Albert Prinz (Dad Prinz) at Prinz’s Dancing Academy back in St. Joseph, Missouri. Dad Prinz’s son LeRoy Prinz was now a successful Dance Director at Paramount Pictures. 

Prinz hired Wyman for the chorus of &quot;College Rhythm&quot; (1934), &quot;Rumba&quot; (1935), &quot;All the King&#x27;s Horses&quot; (1935), &quot;Stolen Harmony&quot; (1935), &quot;Broadway Hostess&quot; (1935), and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1936). In between pictures at Paramount she did &quot;King of Burlesque&quot; (1936) and &quot;George White&#x27;s 1935 Scandals&quot; (1935) at Fox.

She then went to Universal Studios for &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936).

===1936–1944: Career at Warner Bros.===
Jane Wyman signed her first contract with Warner Bros. in 1936 and stayed for the next two decades. &quot;Miracle in the Rain&quot; (1956) would become the last film she completed under contract to the studio. It was released on April 7, 1956 almost exactly twenty years after she signed her inaugural contract.

At Warner Bros, Wyman was in &quot;Freshman Love&quot; (1936) and &quot;Bengal Tiger&quot; (1936), &quot;Stage Struck&quot; (1936), &quot;Cain and Mabel&quot; (1936), and &quot;Here Comes Carter&quot; (1936).

Wyman had her first big role, both singing and dancing in a Dick Foran Western &quot;The Sunday Round-Up&quot; (1936).

Wyman had small parts in &quot;Polo Joe&quot; (1936), and &quot;Gold Diggers of 1937&quot; (1936) but a bigger one in &quot;Smart Blonde&quot; (1936), the first of the Torchy Blane series. She appeared in &quot;Ready, Willing and Able&quot; (1937), &quot;The King and the Chorus Girl&quot; (1937), and &quot;Slim&quot; (1937). She had the lead in &quot;Little Pioneer&quot; (1937), a short, and parts in &quot;The Singing Marine&quot; (1937).

By the time Wyman starred in &quot;Public Wedding&quot; (1937), a &quot;B&quot; picture, she was already divorced from first husband Ernest Wyman. She retained use of the surname for the remainder of her career.

She had a supporting part in &quot;Mr. Dodd Takes the Air&quot; (1937) and was the female lead in some &quot;B&quot; films, such as &quot;The Spy Ring&quot; (1938) (at Universal), &quot;He Couldn&#x27;t Say No&quot; (1938) with Frank McHugh and &quot;Wide Open Faces&quot; (1938) with Joe E. Brown.

Wyman was borrowed by MGM to play a supporting part in &quot;The Crowd Roars&quot; (1938).

Back at Warner Brothers, Wyman was cast as one of the leads in &quot;Brother Rat&quot; (1938) for Hal B. Wallis. It co-starred Ronald Reagan, Priscilla Lane, Wayne Morris and Eddie Albert.

Wyman was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for a supporting role in &quot;Tail Spin&quot; (1939), followed by &quot;The Kid from Kokomo&quot; (1939) with Pat O&#x27;Brien and Morris. She played the title role in &quot;Torchy Blane..Playing with Dynamite&quot; (1939).

Now established, Wyman was cast in &quot;Kid Nightingale&quot; (1939) with John Payne, &quot;Private Detective&quot; (1939) with Foran, &quot;Brother Rat and a Baby&quot; (1940) with Reagan, &quot;An Angel from Texas&quot; (1940) with Albert, &quot;Flight Angels &quot; (1940), and &quot;Gambling on the High Seas&quot; (1940) with Wayne Morris.

Wyman had supporting roles in &quot;A&quot; films such as &quot;My Love Came Back&quot; (1940), starring Olivia de Havilland and Jeffrey Lynn. She and Reagan were in &quot;Tugboat Annie Sails Again&quot; (1940). Wyman was a supporting role to Ann Sheridan in &quot;Honeymoon for Three&quot; (1941) and was Dennis Morgan&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Bad Men of Missouri&quot; (1941).

Wyman made &quot;The Body Disappears&quot; (1941) with Jeffrey Lynn and &quot;You&#x27;re in the Army Now&quot; (1941) with Jimmy Durante; in the latter she and Regis Toomey had the longest screen kiss in cinema history: 3 minutes and 5 seconds.

Wyman did &quot;Larceny, Inc.&quot; (1942) with Edward G. Robinson, and &quot;My Favorite Spy&quot; (1942) with Kay Kyser.

At Twentieth Century Fox, Wyman was a supporting actor to Betty Grable in &quot;Footlight Serenade&quot; (1942) then back at Warners supported Olivia de Havilland in &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot; (1943).

Warners teamed Wyman with Jack Carson in &quot;Make Your Own Bed &quot; (1944) and &quot;The Doughgirls&quot; (1944), then she was top billed in &quot;Crime by Night&quot; (1944). She was one of many stars to cameo in &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944).

===1945–1956: Leading roles and critical acclaim===
Wyman finally gained critical attention with &quot;The Lost Weekend&quot; (1945), made by the team of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. Wilder had wanted Katharine Hepburn or Barbara Stanwyck for the female lead but Brackett had been impressed by Wyman’s performance in &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot;. Wyman called it &quot;a small miracle&quot;.

Wyman remained a supporting actor in &quot;One More Tomorrow&quot; (1946), and &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1946). However Wyman was borrowed by MGM for the female lead in &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1946), and was nominated for the 1946 Academy Award for Best Actress.

She was leading lady for Dennis Morgan in &quot;Cheyenne&quot; (1947) and James Stewart in RKO&#x27;s &quot;Magic Town&quot; (1947).

Her breakthrough role was playing a deaf-mute rape victim in &quot;Johnny Belinda&quot; (1948). Wyman spent over six months preparing for the film which was an enormous hit and won Wyman a Best Actress Oscar. She was the first person in the sound era to earn the award without speaking a line of dialogue. In an amusing acceptance speech, Wyman took her statue and said only, &quot;I accept this, very gratefully, for keeping my mouth shut once. I think I&#x27;ll do it again.&quot;

Wyman was now a top-billed star. She did two comedies, &quot;A Kiss in the Dark&quot; (1948) with David Niven and &quot;The Lady Takes a Sailor&quot; (1949) with Morgan, then made a thriller in England, &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1950) for Alfred Hitchcock.

She played Laura in &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1950), and went to MGM for &quot;Three Guys Named Mike&quot; (1951), a popular comedy.

Frank Capra used her as Bing Crosby&#x27;s leading lady in &quot;Here Comes the Groom&quot; (1951) at Paramount, then she had the lead role in RKO&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951), a melodrama that was a big box office hit and earned her an Oscar nomination.

Wyman was one of many stars in Warner Bros&#x27; &quot;Starlift&quot; (1951). She was the female lead in &quot;The Story of Will Rogers&quot; (1952) and Paramount reunited her and Crosby in &quot;Just for You&quot; (1952). Wyman expressed interest around this time of doing no more &quot;weepy&quot; roles.

Columbia cast her in a musical, &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot; (1953) with Ray Milland, then at Warners she was in &quot;So Big&quot; (1953), a melodrama.

Wyman had a huge success when producer Ross Hunter cast her alongside Rock Hudson in &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; (1954). It earned her another Oscar nomination.

Wyman and Hudson were promptly reteamed on &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot; (1955). Pine-Thomas Productions put Wyman in &quot;Lucy Gallant&quot; (1955) with Charlton Heston. She did &quot;Miracle in the Rain&quot; (1956) with Van Johnson. Wyman was meant to follow this with &quot;Annabella&quot; but it appears to have not been made.

===1951–1953: Recording career===
Jane Wyman&#x27;s brief recording career with Decca Records extended between 1951 and 1953. She recorded a few solo tracks along with duets and novelty songs achieving three 
&quot;Billboard&quot; top 30 hits and appearing on one #1 album.

===1955–1967: Career in television===

Wyman&#x27;s television acting debut was the 1955 episode &quot;Amelia&quot; of the anthology series &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; produced by MCA Inc.&#x27;s Revue Studios and hosted by her former husband Ronald Reagan. 

On August 30, 1955 just a year after &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; became Wyman&#x27;s biggest hit and her first #1 film at the weekly box office her eponymous weekly television anthology series made its debut on NBC. 

Wyman announced her first TV series &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot; (1955–58) in 1955. In its first season it was known as &quot;Jane Wyman Presents the Fireside Theatre&quot; then the &quot;Jane Wyman Theatre&quot; and finally &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;. Wyman hosted every episode, acted in half, and was a producer.

When &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot; ended Wyman was no longer a film star, but she remained in demand. She replaced the ailing Gene Tierney in &quot;Holiday for Lovers&quot; (1959) for Fox, and next appeared in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960) and &quot;Bon Voyage!&quot; (1962).

Wyman continued to guest star on TV shows like &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Investigators&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and &quot;Insight&quot;.

&quot;Something happened in the sixties,&quot; she later said. &quot;it seemed that the time didn&#x27;t permit women to be part of it except in a sort of secondary sort of way which I resented. I kept telling myself &#x27;I didn&#x27;t want to play &quot;Whatever Happened to Baby Jane&quot;.&quot; So she went into semi-retirement around 1962.

===1968–1993: Brief retirement and career resurgence===
Wyman focused on painting. She made the occasional acting appearance, mostly on television.
In 1966, Reginald Denham announced Wyman would appear in a play &quot;Wonderful Us&quot; based on the Parker–Hulme murder case but it was not produced.

She returned to films with &quot;How to Commit Marriage&quot; (1969).

Wyman continued to work in the 1970s, guest starring on &quot;My Three Sons&quot;; &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot;; &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;; and &quot;Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot; and her first film for television, &quot;The Failing of Raymond&quot; (1971). She starred in a pilot for a TV series &quot;Amanda Fallon&quot; but it was not picked up.

She was offered roles of &quot;murderers, old ladies that were senile – they were awful. The weirdest kind of writing.&quot;
After five years of retirement living in Carmel painting and focusing on her philanthropic work she took her first acting role since 1974. She accepted a featured role in the television movie, &quot;The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel&quot; (1979). She then guest starred on &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

In the spring of 1981, Wyman&#x27;s career enjoyed a resurgence when she was cast as the scheming Californian vintner and matriarch Angela Channing in &quot;The Vintage Years&quot;, which was retooled as the primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. Wyman said she wanted to make it as it was a change from &quot;the four handkerchief bits&quot; she was known for. &quot;You just can&#x27;t miss on a thing like this,&quot; she added.

Then relatively unknown Lorenzo Lamas appeared as Angela&#x27;s irresponsible grandson, Lance Cumson. The on- and off-screen chemistry between Wyman and Lamas helped fuel the series&#x27; success.

For her role as Angela Channing, Wyman was nominated for a &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award five times (for Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role and for Outstanding Villainess: Prime Time Serial), and was also nominated for a Golden Globe award in 1983 and 1984. She won in 1984 for Best Performance By an Actress in a TV Series. Later in the show&#x27;s run, Wyman suffered several health problems. In 1986 abdominal surgery caused her to miss two episodes. She was plagued with fatigue during the 1988–1989 season, and her health continued to deteriorate. Later in 1989 she collapsed on the set and was hospitalized due to problems with diabetes and a liver ailment. Her doctors told her that she should end her acting career. Wyman was absent for most of the ninth and final season of &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; in 1989–1990.

Against her doctor&#x27;s advice, she returned for the final three episodes in 1990, even writing a soliloquy for the series finale. Wyman appeared in 208 of the show&#x27;s 227 episodes.

After &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, Wyman acted only once more, playing Jane Seymour&#x27;s screen mother in a 1993 episode of &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;. In all, Wyman had starred in 83 movies and two successful TV series, and was nominated for an Academy Award four times, winning once.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Jane Wyman was married five times, to four men. Her last marriage to Fred Karger ended in 1965 and she never remarried.

====Ernest Wyman====
At age 16, Wyman married salesman Ernest Eugene Wyman in Los Angeles, California, on April 8, 1933. She recorded her name as &#x27;Jane Fulks&#x27;, foster parents Emma and Richard Fulks, and her age as 19 on the wedding certificate. Though the couple divorced after just two years, she retained the name Wyman professionally for the rest of her life.

====Myron Futterman====
Wyman was 20 when she married dress manufacturer Myron Martin Futterman in New Orleans on June 29, 1937. She wanted children but he did not, and they separated after only three months. They were divorced on December 5, 1938.

====Ronald Reagan====
In 1938, Wyman co-starred with Ronald Reagan in &quot;Brother Rat&quot; (1938). They were engaged at the Chicago Theatre, and married on January 26, 1940, at the Wee Kirk o&#x27; the Heather in Glendale, California. She and Reagan had two biological daughters: Maureen in 1941, and Christine in 1947 (born prematurely and died the following day). They adopted a son, Michael, in 1945. 

In the aftermath of the premature birth and subsequent death of their infant daughter Christine on June 26, 1947 Wyman separated from Reagan. Wyman’s divorce from Reagan was granted on June 28, 1948 and finalized on July 18, 1949. Wyman leased a home in Palm Springs, California. Wyman, who was a registered Republican, said that their divorce was due to political differences; Ronald Reagan was still a Democrat at the time.

When Reagan was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1981, Wyman became the first ex-wife of a U.S. president in American history. Although she remained silent during Reagan&#x27;s political career, she told a newspaper interviewer in 1968 that this was not because she was bitter or because she did not agree with him politically:

When Reagan died in 2004, Wyman issued a statement, saying, &quot;America has lost a great president. And a great, kind and gentle man.&quot;

====Frederick Karger====
On November 1, 1952, Wyman married German-American Hollywood music director and composer Frederick M. &quot;Fred&quot; Karger at El Montecito Presbyterian Church, Santa Barbara. They separated on November 7, 1954, and were granted an interlocutory divorce decree on December 7, 1954; the divorce was finalized on December 30, 1955.

They remarried on March 11, 1961, and Karger divorced her again on March 9, 1965. According to &quot;The New York Times&#x27;&quot; report of the divorce, the bandleader charged that the actress &quot;had walked out on him.&quot; Wyman had a stepdaughter, Terry, from Karger&#x27;s marriage to Patti Sacks.

Wyman, who had converted to Catholicism in 1953, never remarried. She was a member of the Good Shepherd Parish and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California.

===Later life===
After &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; ended, Wyman made a guest appearance on the CBS series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; and then completely retired from acting; she spent her retirement painting and entertaining friends. Wyman was a recluse and made only a few public appearances in her last years in part due to suffering from arthritis. Wyman also suffered from Type 1 diabetes from a very young age. She attended the funeral of her long-time friend Loretta Young in 2000. She attended her daughter&#x27;s funeral in 2001 after Maureen died of melanoma, and Ronald Reagan&#x27;s funeral in 2004.

===Death===
On September 10, 2007, Wyman died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Rancho Mirage, California, at age 90. Her son Michael Reagan released a statement saying:

A lay tertiary of the Dominican Order of the Catholic Church, she was buried in a nun&#x27;s habit. She was interred at Forest Lawn Mortuary and Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California.

<text>Neuwied () is a town in the north of the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate, capital of the District of Neuwied. Neuwied lies on the east bank of the Rhine, 12 km northwest of Koblenz, on the railway from Frankfurt am Main to Cologne. The town has 13 suburban administrative districts: Heimbach-Weis, Gladbach, Engers, Oberbieber, Niederbieber, Torney, Segendorf, Altwied, Block, Irlich, Feldkirchen, Heddesdorf and Rodenbach. The largest is Heimbach-Weis, with approximately 8000 inhabitants.

==History==

Near Neuwied, one of the largest Roman &quot;castra&quot; on the Rhine has been excavated by archeologists. Caesar&#x27;s Rhine bridges are believed to have been built nearby.

Neuwied was founded in 1653 by Count Frederick III of Wied, initially as a fortress on the site of the village of Langendorf, which had been destroyed in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). It was to serve as the new residence of the lower county, secure its only access to the Rhine and enable the small state, impoverished in the war, to participate in Rhine trade. However, since the place hardly attracted any settlers due to its unfavourable location in a frequently flooded area, the counts of the House of Wied, especially Frederick III, Frederick William and John Frederick Alexander pursued a policy of self-administration and extensive religious tolerance in the town unlike in the rest of their territory. These liberties led to the immigration of numerous religious refugees from other German territories, but also from France and Switzerland, and to a rapid increase in the population. From the middle of the 18th century, members of seven religious communities lived in Neuwied: Calvinists, to which the count&#x27;s house also belonged, Lutherans, Catholics, Mennonites, Inspirationalists, Moravian Brethren and Jews.

The refugees and their descendants contributed significantly to the economic upswing of the town in the 18th and 19th century. Handicraft products by the cabinetmakers Abraham and David Roentgen, who belonged to the Moravian Brethren, or the Mennonite clockmaker Peter Kinzing were found at almost all important courts of Europe between Versailles and St. Petersburg. Thanks to the foundation of the Rasselstein iron rolling mill by Count John Frederick Alexander, Neuwied was one of the first industrial locations in Germany.

On 18 April 1797 the French army, led by General Louis Lazare Hoche, defeated the Austrians under General Franz von Werneck at the Battle of Neuwied.

Neuwied is the native town of paternal ancestors of John D. Rockefeller, traced to the 16th century and possible French Huguenot refugees. His father&#x27;s line emigrated to the North American colonies, arriving in New York in 1710, the year of a massive immigration of nearly 2800 Palatine German refugees, whose transportation costs from London were covered by Queen Anne&#x27;s British government. Neuwied was also the birthplace of William of Wied, who briefly held the title of King of Albania in 1914.

==Geography==
Parts of the 86.5 square kilometre area are divided into the suburban districts of:
* 
* Engers
* 
* 
* 
* 


The core of Neuwied and the former village of Heddesdorf, which belonged to the municipality before these districts were added, are not listed as districts themselves.

The place of the abandoned former village of Rockenfeld, which is considered to be the origin and namesake of the famous Rockefeller family, also belongs to today&#x27;s municipal territory of Neuwied.

Since the inner city of Neuwied is situated on a former bed of the river Rhine, it is at great risk of flooding. It is one of very few towns in the region protected by flood-prevention levees, a source of friction with communities downstream.

Neuwied is twinned with the London Borough of Bromley.

==Politics==
The 2019 municipal council elections led to the following distribution of seats: CDU (15), SPD (12), Greens (7), AfD (5), FWG (3), FDP (2), The Left (2), Ich tu&#x27;s (2).

==Population==
Originally there were only a few thousand people living in Neuwied, with the number not growing significantly because of wars and famines. With the industrialization in the 19th century the number of inhabitants increased from 5,600 in 1831 to 18,000 in 1905.

By 1970 the figure had grown to 31,400 and following a major realignment incorporating several communities within the town, it jumped to 63,000.

As of 30 June 2005 there were officially 66,455 people living in Neuwied.

==Infrastructure==

Neuwied is connected to the German network of &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; (national routes) (here: B9, B42 and B256). The &quot;Autobahnen&quot; (motorways) A3, A48 and A61 are quickly reachable from Neuwied.

===Public transport===
Within the bounds of Neuwied are two railway stations, Neuwied and Engers on the Right Rhine line, and a third station is under consideration by the state agency for northern commuter railway services (SPNV Nord), which is responsible for the service on the railway lines connecting to Koblenz Hauptbahnhof in the south and Köln Hauptbahnhof in the north. Via either of those stations, the German high-speed rail network and the InterCity network are accessible. Daytime service include the following:
* a Deutsche Bahn hourly semi-fast train (Regional-Express), the Rhein-Erft-Express, running Koblenz-Engers-Neuwied-Cologne-Mönchengladbach and back,
* and a Deutsche Bahn hourly all-stops service (Regionalbahn) Koblenz-Neuwied-Cologne-Stommeln(-Mönchengladbach) and back, which is also available in the evening hours.
* A VIAS hourly semi-fast train (StadtExpress) Neuwied-Koblenz-Lahnstein-Wiesbaden(-Frankfurt) and back, running also in evening hours.

It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to travel to Koblenz while Cologne is about 70 to 80 minutes away, Mainz 90 to 120 minutes, direct connection to Frankfurt is around 150 minutes, sometimes faster when changing to the IC/ICE network.

Public transport within Neuwied relies on a bus network, offering (depending on line) 20, 30 or 60-minute schedules, the majority of lines are served by Transdev.

All public transport (road and rail) is integrated into the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Mosel public transport association. Tickets are valid for all service, restricted by time and fare zones. For more information on timetables, see .

<doc id="183758" wikidata="Q3699851" url="?curid=183758" title="Cyclorama (album)">
<text>Cyclorama is the fourteenth studio album by Styx, released in 2003. This was the first studio album with Lawrence Gowan, following the departure of group co-founder Dennis DeYoung in 1999. It was also the latter of two albums to feature Glen Burtnik (the former being 1990&#x27;s &quot;Edge of the Century&quot;), and the only album released by the Lawrence Gowan/Tommy Shaw/James &quot;JY&quot; Young/Glen Burtnik/Chuck Panozzo/Todd Sucherman lineup, and as such the only original Styx album to feature four different singer-songwriters (Shaw, Young, Gowan and Burtnik) as opposed to the usual three. The album peaked significantly higher on the Billboard album charts than Styx&#x27;s previous release, &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1999), ending up 48 slots higher at No. 127 (1 week), but paled in comparison to previous 1970s and 1980s releases on A&amp;M Records.

The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Waiting for Our Time,&quot; which failed to chart on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&quot; singles chart. It charted at #37 for 1 week on the Mainstream Rock charts. A video was released for the single &quot;Yes I Can,&quot; but it failed to chart. 

The album was also released as a &quot;Dual Disc,&quot; with the reverse side of the disc containing a 5.1 DVD-Audio mix as well as music videos. The album was finally released to streaming services in 2020.

<text>Loretta Young (born Gretchen Michaela Young; January 6, 1913 – August 12, 2000) was an American actress. Starting as a child, she had a long and varied career in film from 1917 to 1989. She received numerous honors including an Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and three Primetime Emmy Awards as well as two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her work in film and television. 

She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the film &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1947), and received her second Academy Award nomination for her role in &quot;Come to the Stable&quot; (1949). She also starred in films such as &quot;Born to Be Bad&quot; (1934), &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; (1935), &quot;The Crusades&quot; (1935), &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; (1939), &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1946), &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947), and &quot;Key to the City&quot; (1950).

Young moved to the relatively new medium of television, where she had a dramatic anthology series, &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, from 1953 to 1961. It earned three Primetime Emmy Awards, and was re-run successfully on daytime TV and later in syndication. She also starred in &quot;The New Loretta Young Show&quot; from 1962 to 1963. Young returned to the small screen in the 1980s starring in two NBC television movies, &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (1986), for which she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film, and &quot;Lady in a Corner&quot; (1989).

==Early life and education==
Young was born Gretchen Michaela Young in Salt Lake City, Utah, the daughter of Gladys (née Royal) and John Earle Young.
She was of Luxembourgish descent. When she was two years old, her parents separated, and when she was three, her mother moved the family to Hollywood. A priest helped Gladys to establish a boarding house as income. Gladys&#x27; sister&#x27;s husband helped the little girls get small parts in silent films for income. Gladys met Ida Botiller Lindley, a very wealthy widow, by 1925. Ida had no children, but wanted to carry on her husband&#x27;s name; she proposed that she adopt Gretchen&#x27;s younger brother John Royal Young (1914-1997), educating him to be a lawyer like her late husband. Her brother thus became John Royal Young Lindley (later John R. Lindley), and he became a lawyer. However, as a result he did not remain in close contact with his sisters. Gretchen and her sisters, Polly Ann and Elizabeth Jane (better known as Sally Blane), all worked as child actresses, but of the three, Gretchen was the most successful. Polly Ann Young, Sally Blane, and John R. Lindley all died in their 80s in 1997. John R. Lindley&#x27;s son, David, became a well-known multi-instrumentalist rock musician.

Young&#x27;s first role was at the age of three in the silent film &quot;Sweet Kitty Bellairs&quot;. During her high-school years she was educated at Ramona Convent Secondary School. She was signed to a contract by John McCormick, husband and manager of actress Colleen Moore, who saw the young girl&#x27;s potential. Moore gave her the name Loretta, explaining that it was the name of her favorite doll.

==Career==
===1919–1939: Film debut and early films===

Young was billed as Gretchen Young in the silent film &quot;Sirens of the Sea&quot; (1917). She was first billed as Loretta Young in 1928, in &quot;The Whip Woman&quot;. That same year, she co-starred with Lon Chaney in the MGM film &quot;Laugh, Clown, Laugh&quot;. The next year, she was named one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars. In 1930, when she was 17, she eloped with 26-year-old actor Grant Withers; they were married in Yuma, Arizona. The marriage was annulled the next year, just as their second movie together (coincidentally entitled &quot;Too Young to Marry&quot;) was released.

In 1934, she co-starred with Cary Grant in the pre-Code drama &quot;Born to be Bad&quot; released by Twentieth Century Pictures. This film was rejected by the Hays Office twice before it was finally approved. The next year Young starred opposite Clark Gable and Jack Oakie in the 1935 film adaptation of Jack London&#x27;s action adventure novel &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, directed by William Wellman. Also in 1935 she portrayed Berengaria, Princess of Navarre in the Cecil B. DeMille directed historical epic &quot;The Crusades&quot; (1935). The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival where it received an award for Best Foreign Film. 
The following year she starred as Lady Helen Dudley Dearden in &quot;The Unguarded Hour&quot; (1936). The film was directed by Sam Wood and was based on the 1935 play of the same name by Bernard Merivale. In 1938 she played Countess Eugenie de Montijo in the romantic drama &quot;Suez&quot; starring opposite Tyrone Power. The film was directed by Allan Dwan and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck.

===1940–1952: Career breakthrough===
During World War II, Young made &quot;Ladies Courageous&quot; (1944; re-issued as &quot;Fury in the Sky&quot;), the fictionalized story of the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron. It depicted a unit of female pilots who flew bomber planes from the factories to their final destinations. Young made as many as eight movies a year, and her films in the 1940s were among the best regarded and most memorable of her career.
In 1946, Young made &quot;The Stranger&quot;, in which she plays a small-town American woman who unknowingly marries a Nazi fugitive (Orson Welles). Welles recalled that the film&#x27;s producer ordered a close-up of Young during a pivotal scene, a choice that Welles, who directed, considered &quot;fatal&quot; to the scene&#x27;s impact. Young took the director&#x27;s side, even getting her agent on the phone to take Welles&#x27;s side. &quot;Imagine getting a star&#x27;s agent in to ensure that she wouldn&#x27;t get a closeup!&quot; Welles later said. &quot;She was wonderful.&quot; Critic Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post noted, &quot;The languorous Miss Young has the toughest assignment, being called on to shift from the starry-eyed bride of the early reels to the woman who must know in her heart that her husband is one of the most hated of men.&quot;

In 1947, Young won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; a political comedy that required her to learn a Swedish accent. Ruth Roberts, who had coached Ingrid Bergman on how to lose her Swedish accent, taught Young how to gain one. That same year, she co-starred with Cary Grant and David Niven in the romantic comedy &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot;, a perennial Christmas favorite, which was remade in 1996 as &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;, starring Denzel Washington, Whitney Houston and Courtney B. Vance. In 1949, she received another Academy Award nomination for her role as Sister Margaret in the comedy drama &quot;Come to the Stable&quot;. In 1953, she appeared in her last theatrical film, &quot;It Happens Every Thursday&quot;, a Universal comedy about a New York couple who move to California to take over a struggling weekly newspaper; her co-star was John Forsythe.
In 1950 she reunited with Clark Gable for the romantic comedy &quot;Key to the City&quot;. During production of the film, Gable visited the Young household and spoke with his, and Young&#x27;s, natural daughter, Judy Lewis, for the only time in Lewis&#x27; life. Lewis was fifteen at the time and did not know of Gable&#x27;s role in her conception. The next year she starred in the melodrama &quot;Cause for Alarm!&quot; (1951) and the comedy &quot;Half Angel&quot; (1951), followed by Columbia Pictures&#x27; film noir &quot;Paula&quot; (1952). Also in 1952 she starred in the romance drama &quot;Because of You&quot; from Universal Pictures.

===1953–1961: Television stardom===
Young hosted and starred in the well-received half-hour anthology television series &quot;Letter to Loretta&quot; (soon retitled &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;), which was originally broadcast from 1953 to 1961. She earned three Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for the program. Her trademark was a dramatic entrance through a living room door in various high-fashion evening gowns. She returned at the program&#x27;s conclusion to offer a brief passage from the Bible or a famous quote that reflected upon the evening&#x27;s story. (Young&#x27;s introductions and concluding remarks were not re-run on television because she legally stipulated that they not be, as she did not want the dresses she wore in those segments to make the program seem dated.) 

The show ran in prime time on NBC for eight years, the longest-running primetime network program hosted by a woman up to that time. The program was based on the premise that each drama was an answer to a question asked in her fan mail. The title was changed to &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot; during the first season (as of the episode of February 14, 1954), and the &quot;letter&quot; concept was dropped at the end of the second season. Toward the end of the second season, Young was hospitalized as a result of overwork, which required a number of guest hosts and guest stars; her first appearance in the 1955–1956 season was for the Christmas show. From then on, Young appeared in only about half of each season&#x27;s shows as an actress, and served as the program&#x27;s host for the remainder. 

Minus Young&#x27;s introductions and conclusions, the series was re-run as the &quot;Loretta Young Theatre&quot; in daytime by NBC from 1960 to 1964. It also appeared in syndication into the early 1970s, before being withdrawn. In 1972, a jury in Los Angeles awarded Young $550,000 in a lawsuit against NBC for breach of contract. Filed in 1966, the suit contended that NBC had allowed foreign television outlets to re-run old episodes of &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;, without excluding, as agreed by the parties, the opening segment in which Young made her entrance. Young testified that her image had been damaged by portraying her in &quot;outdated gowns&quot;. She had sought damages of $1.9 million.

===1986–1994: Return to acting and final roles===
Young briefly came out of retirement to star in the NBC television film &quot;Christmas Eve&quot; (1986). The story revolves around an elderly woman played by Young who befriends the homeless and volunteers her time with children, who learns she has an incurable illness and wants desperately to reunite her three grown grand children. Young starred alongside Trevor Howard and Ron Leibman, all three of whom received Golden Globe Award nominations with Young winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film. She then starred in her final role, another NBC television film, 
&quot;Lady in a Corner&quot; (1989) starring as the editor-in-chief of a high fashion magazine. She starred opposite Brian Keith, Roscoe Lee Brown, and Bruce Davison. For her performance she received another Golden Globe Award nomination in the same category losing to Christine Lahti in the CBS film &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Young was married three times and had three children. Her first marriage was to actor Grant Withers in 1930. The marriage was annulled the following year. From September 1933 to June 1934, she had a well-publicized affair with actor Spencer Tracy (who was married to Louise Tracy), her co-star in &quot;Man&#x27;s Castle&quot;. In 1940, Young married producer Tom Lewis. They had two sons: Peter Lewis (of the San Francisco rock band Moby Grape); and Christopher Lewis, a film director. Young and Lewis divorced in 1969.

In 1993, Young married for the third and final time, to the fashion designer Jean Louis. Their marriage lasted until his death in April 1997. Young was godmother to Marlo Thomas (daughter of TV star Danny Thomas).

A smoker since the age of eight, Young quit the habit in the mid-1980s, gaining 10 pounds.

===Judy Lewis===
Young and Clark Gable were the romantic leads of the 1935 Twentieth Century Pictures film &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;. Young was then 22 years old; Gable was 34 and married to Maria “Ria” Langham. During filming, Young became pregnant by Gable. 

Young did not want to damage her career or that of Gable. She knew if her studio, Twentieth Century Pictures, learned of her pregnancy, they would pressure her to have an abortion. Young was unwilling to have an abortion because she considered abortion a mortal sin. Young, her sisters, and their mother devised a plan to conceal the pregnancy and then pretend that her child had been adopted. When Young&#x27;s pregnancy began to advance, she went on a &quot;vacation&quot; to England. After returning to California, she gave an interview from her bed, covered in blankets; at that time, she stated that her long movie absence was due to a condition she had had since childhood. Young gave birth to a daughter, Judith, on November 6, 1935, in Venice, California. Young named Judith after St. Jude because he was the patron saint of (among other things) difficult situations. Weeks after her birth, Judith was placed in an orphanage. Judith spent the next 19 months in various &quot;hideaways and orphanages&quot; before being re-united with her mother; Young then claimed that she had adopted Judith. After Young married Tom Lewis, Judith took Lewis&#x27;s last name.

Young and Gable starred together in &quot;Key to the City&quot; in 1950, when Lewis was 15 years old. At this time, Gable visited the Young household and spoke to Lewis for the only time in her life.

Judy Lewis bore a strong resemblance to Gable, and her true parentage was widely rumored in entertainment circles. When Lewis was 31 years old, she confronted her mother about her parentage; Young privately admitted that she was Lewis&#x27;s birth mother, stating that Lewis was &quot;a walking mortal sin.&quot; Young refused to confirm or comment publicly on the rumors until 1999, when Joan Wester Anderson wrote Young&#x27;s authorized biography. In interviews with Anderson for the book, Young stated that Lewis was her biological child and the product of a brief affair with Gable. Young would not allow the book to be published until after her death.

In 2015, Linda Lewis, the wife of Young&#x27;s son, Christopher, stated publicly that in 1998, Young (then 85 years old) had stated that Judy Lewis had been conceived through an act of date rape by Clark Gable. According to Linda Lewis, Young added that no consensual intimate contact had occurred between Gable and herself. Young had never disclosed the rape to anyone. Lewis said Young shared this information after learning of the concept of date rape from watching &quot;Larry King Live&quot;; she had previously believed it was a woman&#x27;s job to fend off men&#x27;s amorous advances and had perceived her inability to thwart Gable&#x27;s attack as a moral failing on her part. Linda Lewis said that the family remained silent about Young&#x27;s rape claim until after both Young and Judy Lewis had died.

===Politics===
Young was a life-long Republican. In 1952, she appeared in radio, print, and magazine ads in support of Dwight D. Eisenhower in his campaign for US president. She attended his inauguration in 1953, along with Anita Louise, Louella Parsons, Jane Russell, Dick Powell, June Allyson, and Lou Costello, among others. She was a vocal supporter of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan in their presidential campaigns in 1968 and 1980, respectively. Young was also an active member of the Hollywood Republican Committee, with her close friends Irene Dunne, Ginger Rogers, William Holden, George Murphy, Fred Astaire, and John Wayne.

===Charity===
From the time of Young&#x27;s retirement in the 1960s until not long before her death, she devoted herself to volunteer work for charities and churches, together with her friends of many years Jane Wyman, Irene Dunne, and Rosalind Russell. She was a member of the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills, and the Catholic Motion Picture Guild in Beverly Hills, California. A devout Catholic, she worked with various Catholic charities after her acting career.

===Illness and death===
Young died of ovarian cancer on August 12, 2000, at the home of her maternal half-sister, Georgiana Young (the wife of actor Ricardo Montalbán) in Los Angeles, California. She was interred in the family plot in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Her ashes were buried in the grave of her mother, Gladys Belzer.

<doc id="183760" wikidata="Q22932" url="?curid=183760" title="Count palatine">
<text>A count palatine (Latin &quot;comes palatinus&quot;), also count of the palace or palsgrave (from German &quot;Pfalzgraf&quot;), was originally an official attached to a royal or imperial palace or household and later a nobleman of a rank above that of an ordinary count. The title originated in the Late Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages especially and into modern times, it is associated with the Holy Roman Empire, especially Electoral Palatinate.

The office, jurisdiction or territory of a count palatine was a county palatine or palatinate. In England the forms earl palatine and palatine earldom are rare alternative terms.

==Importance of a count palatine in medieval Europe==

===&quot;Comes palatinus&quot;===

This Latin title is the original, but is also pre-feudal: it originated as Roman &quot;comes&quot;, which was a non-hereditary court title of high rank meaning &quot;companion&quot; and connoting the status of peer, the specific part &quot;palatinus&quot; being the adjective derived from &quot;palatium&quot; (&#x27;palace&#x27;).

After the fall of Rome, a new feudal type of title, also known simply as &quot;palatinus&quot;, started developing. The Frankish kings of the Merovingian dynasty (reigned 480–750) employed a high official, the &quot;comes palatinus&quot;, who at first assisted the king in his judicial duties and at a later date discharged many of these himself. Other counts palatine were employed on military and administrative work.

In the Visigothic Kingdom, the &quot;Officium Palatinum&quot; consisted of a number of men with the title of count who managed the various departments of the royal household. The &quot;Comes Cubiculariorum&quot; oversaw the chamberlains, the &quot;Comes Scanciorum&quot; directed the cup-bearers, the &quot;Comes Stabulorum&quot; directed the equerries in charge of the stables, etc. The Ostrogothic Kingdom also maintained palatine counts with titles such as &quot;Comes Patrimonium&quot;, who was in charge of the patrimonial or private real estate of the king, and others.

The system was maintained by the Carolingian sovereigns (reigned 751–987), who increased the power of counts palatine through successive grants of authority. A Frankish capitulary of 882 and Hincmar, archbishop of Reims, writing about the same time, attest to the extent to which the judicial work of the Frankish Empire had passed into the hands of counts palatine.

Instead of remaining near the person of the king, some of the counts palatine were sent to various parts of his empire to act as judges and governors, the districts ruled by them being called palatinates. Being in a special sense the representatives of the sovereign, they were entrusted with more extended power than the ordinary counts. In this way came about the later and more general use of the word &quot;palatine&quot;, its application as an adjective to persons entrusted with special powers—but also to the districts over which these powers were exercised.

By the High Middle Ages, the title &quot;count&quot; had become increasingly common, to the point that both great magnates who ruled regions that were the size of duchies, and local castle-lords, might style themselves &quot;count.&quot; As the great magnates began to centralize their power over their local castle-lords, they felt the need to assert the difference between themselves and these minor &quot;counts&quot;. Therefore, several of these great magnates began styling themselves &quot;Count palatine&quot;, signifying great counts ruling regions equivalent to duchies, such as the Counts Palatine of Champagne in the 13th century. See also Royal Administration of Merovingian and Carolingian Dynasties.

===Related titles===
In early medieval Poland, the &quot;Palatinus&quot; was next in rank to the King. As he is also the chief commander of the King&#x27;s army the rank is merged with &quot;Wojewoda&quot;, with the latter replacing the title of Palatine. During the Fragmentation of Poland each Prince would have his own &quot;voivode&quot;. When some of these Principalities were reunited into the Kingdom of Poland, the Palatines were infeudated with them, as there was no longer a local Prince to rule on behalf of the King to whom all these princely titles returned. The Principalities are thus made Voivodships (sometimes translated as Palatinates). In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth the &quot;Voivodes&quot; sit in the Senate. Throughout its history, the dignity remained non-hereditary, or semi-hereditary. Today &quot;voivodes&quot; are government officials.

As successor to the Byzantine emperor after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultan also claimed the right to bestow the office. Thus Giovanni Bellini was named &quot;Comes palatinus&quot; by Emperor Frederick III in 1469 and later again in 1481 by Sultan Mehmet II.

&quot;Grand Čelnik&quot; (велики челник). The Grand Čelnik was the highest court title of the Serbian Despotate, and the title-holders held great provinces, property, and honours, and Radič (fl. 1413–1441) was one of the most powerful ones.
Hungary in the Middle Ages: &quot;nádorispán&quot; or &quot;nádor&quot; (see Palatine of Hungary)

The term &quot;count palatine&quot; was not used in the United Kingdom. Just as &quot;count&quot; always remained reserved for continental territories, even though the equivalence of earl became clear by rendering it in Latin also as &quot;comes&quot;, &quot;earl palatine&quot; was the exclusively British title for the incumbent of a British county palatine.

== Merovingian and Carolingian Counts palatine ==

=== Robertians ===
*Chrodobertus II, was named on 2 October 678
* Grimbert, probably son of Chrodobertus II, was of Neustria from 691 to 720
* Robert I (also known as &quot;Rupert I&quot;; d. before 764), grandson of Chrodobertus II, was around 741/742
* Anselm (d. 778 in Roncesvalles), son of Robert
*Adalard of Paris, in 877
* Cobbo the Younger

=== Counts Palatine of Champagne ===
King Lothar of France (954–986) gave Herbert III of Omois, one of his most loyal supporters in the struggle against the Robertians, the title of Count palatine. The title was later inherited by his nephews, precursors of the Counts of Champagne. The title of Count of the palace is therefore linked to the title of Count of Champagne until its extiction in 1305.

==Holy Roman Empire==
Pfalzgraf (Old High German &quot;phalanzgrāvo&quot;) is the German equivalent of the title, &quot;Graf&quot; being the German term for &quot;count&quot; or &quot;earl&quot;, and &quot;Pfalz&quot; being the German reflex of Latin &quot;palatium&quot;. The German title has also been rendered as &quot;palsgrave&quot; in English (recorded 1548).

Counts Palatine were the permanent representatives of the Frankish king, later of the Holy Roman Emperor, in a palatial domain of the crown. There were dozens of these royal &quot;Pfalzen&quot; throughout the early Empire, and the emperor would travel between them, as there was no imperial capital.

In the empire, the word count palatine was also used to designate the officials who assisted the emperor in exercising the rights which were reserved for his personal consideration, like granting arms. They were called Imperial counts palatine (in Latin &quot;comites palatini caesarii&quot;, or &quot;comites sacri palatii&quot;; in German, &quot;Hofpfalzgrafen&quot;). Both the Latin form &quot;(Comes) palatinus&quot; and the French &quot;(comte) palatin&quot; have been used as part of the full title of the Dukes of Burgundy (a branch of the French royal dynasty) to render their rare German title Freigraf, which was the style of a (later lost) bordering principality, the allodial County of Burgundy (&quot;Freigrafschaft Burgund&quot; in German), which came to be known as Franche-Comté.

During the 11th century, some imperial palatine counts became a valuable political counterweight against the mighty duchies. Surviving old palatine counties were turned into new institutional pillars through which the imperial authority could be exercised. By the reigns of Henry the Fowler and especially of Otto the Great, &quot;comites palatini&quot; were sent into all parts of the country to support the royal authority by checking the independent tendencies of the great tribal dukes. Apparent thereafter was the existence of a count palatine in Saxony, and of others in Lorraine, in Bavaria and in Swabia, their duties being to administer the royal estates in these duchies.

Next to the Dukes of Lotharingia, Bavaria, Swabia and Saxony, who had become dangerously powerful feudal princes, loyal supporters of the German Emperor were installed as counts palatine.

The Lotharingian palatines out of the Ezzonian dynasty were important commanders of the imperial army and were often employed during internal and external conflicts (e.g. to suppress rebelling counts or dukes, to settle frontier disputes with the Hungarian and the French kingdom and to lead imperial campaigns).

Although a palatinate could belong for decades to one dynasty, the office of the palatine counts became hereditary only during the 12th century. During the 11th century the palatinates were still regarded as &quot;beneficia&quot;, non-hereditary fiefs. The count palatine in Bavaria, an office held by the family of Wittelsbach, became duke of this land, the lower comital title being then merged into the higher ducal one. The Count Palatine of Lotharingia changed his name to Count Palatine of the Rhine in 1085, alone remaining independent until 1777. The office having become hereditary, Pfalzgrafen were in existence until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. The palatinate of Saxony merged with the Electoral Duchy of Saxony. The Palatinate of the Rhine became an electorate, and both were Imperial Vicars.

=== Counts Palatine of Bavaria ===
Originally, the Counts Palatine held the County Palatine (around Regensburg), and were subordinate to the Dukes of Bavaria, rather than to the king. The position gave its holder a leading position in the legal system of the Duchy.

* Rapoto III (d. 1248), son of Rapoto II, Count Palatine of Bavaria from 1231 until his death. He was the last Count Palatine; after his death the Duke of Bavaria assumed the rights and possessions of the Counts Palatine.

=== Counts Palatine of Lotharingia ===
* Wigeric (915 – before 922), Count Palatine of Lotharingia and Count in the Bidgau
* Gottfried ( – after 949), Count Palatine of Lotharingia and Count in the Jülichgau

From 985, the Ezzonids held the title:
* Herman I (d. before 996), Count Palatine of Lotharingia and Count in the Bonngau, the Eiffelgau, the Zülpichgau and the Auelgau 
* Ezzo (d. 1034), son of Herman I, Count in the Auelgau and the Bonngau, Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1020, married Mathilda of Saxony, the daughter of Emperor Otto II
* Otto (d. 1047), son of Ezzo, Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1035 to 1045, then Duke of Swabia as Otto II from 1045 until his death
* Henry I (d. 1061), son of Ezzo&#x27;s brother Hezzelin I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1045 to 1060
* Herman II (1049–1085), son of Henry I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1061 to 1085 (until 1064 under the guardianship of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne), also Count in the Ruhrgau and the Zülpichgau and Count of Brabant

The County Palatine of Lotharingia was suspended by the Emperor. Adelaide of Weimar-Orlamünde, Herman II&#x27;s widow, remarried to Henry of Laach. About 1087 he was assigned in the newly created office of Count Palatine of the Rhine.

=== Counts Palatine of the Rhine ===
In 1085, after the death of Herman II, the County Palatine of Lotharingia lost its military importance in Lorraine. The territorial authority of the Count Palatine was reduced to his territories along the Rhine. Consequently, he is called the Count Palatine of the Rhine after 1085.

The Golden Bull of 1356 made the Count Palatine of the Rhine one of the seven electors. He was therefore known as the Elector Palatine.

=== Counts Palatine of Saxony ===
In the 10th century the Emperor Otto I created the County Palatine of Saxony in the Saale-Unstrut area of southern Saxony. The honour was initially held by a Count of Hessengau, then from the early 11th century by the Counts of Goseck, later by the Counts of Sommerschenburg, and still later by the Landgraves of Thuringia:
* Adalbero (d. 982) was a Count in the Hessengau and in the Liesgau, Count Palatine of Saxony from 972,

In 1169, Emperor Frederick I created the Free County of Burgundy (not to be confused with its western neighbour, the Duchy of Burgundy). The Counts of Burgundy had the title of Free Count (), but are sometimes called Counts Palatine.

===Papal counts palatine===
A papal count palatine (&quot;Comes palatinus lateranus&quot;, properly &quot;Comes sacri Lateranensis palatii&quot; &quot;Count of the Sacred Palace of Lateran&quot;) began to be conferred by the pope in the 16th century. This title was merely honorary and by the 18th century had come to be conferred so widely as to be nearly without consequence. 
The Order of the Golden Spur began to be associated with the inheritable patent of nobility in the form of count palatinate during the Renaissance; Emperor Frederick III named Baldo Bartolini, professor of civil law at the University of Perugia, a count palatinate in 1469, entitled in turn to confer university degrees.

Pope Leo X designated all of the secretaries of the papal curia &quot;Comites aulae Lateranensis&quot; (&quot;Counts of the Lateran court&quot;) in 1514 and bestowed upon them the rights similar to an imperial count palatine. In some cases the title was conferred by specially empowered papal legates. If an imperial count palatine possessed both an imperial and the papal appointment, he bore the title of &quot;Comes palatine imperiali Papali et auctoritate&quot; (Count palatine by Imperial and Papal authority).

The Order of the Golden Spur, linked with the title of count palatinate, was widely conferred after the Sack of Rome, 1527, by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor; the text of surviving diplomas conferred hereditary nobility to the recipients. 
Among the recipients was Titian (1533), who had painted an equestrian portrait of Charles. 
Close on the heels of the Emperor&#x27;s death in 1558, its refounding in Papal hands is attributed to Pope Pius IV in 1559.
Benedict XIV (&quot;In Supremo Militantis Ecclesiæ&quot;, 1746) granted to the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre the right to use the title of Count of the Sacred Palace of Lateran.

By the mid-18th century the Order of the Golden Spur was being so indiscriminately bestowed that Casanova remarked &quot;The Order they call the Golden Spur was so disparaged that people irritated me greatly when they asked me the details of my cross;&quot;

The Order was granted to &quot;those in the pontifical government, artists, and others, whom the pope should think deserving of reward. It is likewise given to strangers, no other condition being required, but that of professing the catholic religion.&quot;

<text>Pieces of Eight is the eighth studio album by American progressive rock band Styx, released in September 1978.

Like the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; (1977), it managed to achieve triple platinum certification, thanks to the hit singles &quot;Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)&quot; and &quot;Renegade&quot;.

The band members produced and recorded the album (like their previous three efforts) at Paragon Studios in Chicago with recording engineer Barry Mraz and mixing engineer Rob Kingsland. &quot;I&#x27;m O.K.&quot; was recorded at Paragon and St. James Cathedral. This would be the last Styx album to be produced at Paragon Studios.

The album&#x27;s cover was done by Hipgnosis. Dennis DeYoung stated in the 1991 interview with Redbeard on the &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; episode that he initially hated the cover but grew to like it as he got older.

==Background==
The record is considered by some to be Styx&#x27;s most obvious concept album, as well as the last Styx album with significant progressive rock leanings. The theme of the album, as Dennis DeYoung explained on &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; which devoted an entire episode to &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;, was about &quot;not giving up your dreams just for the pursuit of money and material possessions&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Lester Bangs was critical of the album, writing that &quot;what&#x27;s really interesting is not that such narcissistic slop should get recorded, but what must be going on in the minds of the people who support it in such amazing numbers. Gall, nerve and ego have never been far from great rock &amp; roll. Yet there&#x27;s a thin but crucial line between those qualities and what it takes to fill arenas today: sheer self-aggrandizement on the most puerile level. If these are the champions, gimme the cripples.&quot; &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted that &quot;when Styx strays too far from its rock and roll foundations ... as on the Gothic-pretentious numbers by Dennis De Young like &#x27;Lords of the Ring&#x27;, it starts getting less credible.&quot;

Mike DeGagne of AllMusic has retrospectively praised the album, saying that the songs on the album &quot;rekindle some of Styx&#x27;s early progressive rock sound, only cleaner.&quot;

The album peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard album chart, and like its predecessor would go triple platinum.

<doc id="183763" wikidata="Q2164191" url="?curid=183763" title="The Grand Illusion">
<text>The Grand Illusion is the seventh studio album by American rock band Styx. Recorded at Paragon Recording Studios in Chicago, the album was released on July 7, 1977, by A&amp;M Records, intentionally choosing the combination 7th on 7-7-77 for luck. The release was a smash worldwide, selling three million copies in the US (Triple Platinum) alone. Some estimates have the album at over 6 million copies sold. The album launched the band to stardom and spawned the hit singles &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; and &quot;Fooling Yourself.&quot; The title track also received substantial FM airplay, but was never released as an official single.

The album cover art is based on Rene Magritte&#x27;s 1965 painting, &quot;The Blank Signature.&quot;

==Background and songs==
As with much of Styx&#x27;s catalog, many of the songs have quasi-medieval/fantasy lyrics and themes. Some are allegories and commentaries on contemporary American life and the members&#x27; experiences in an American rock band in the late 1970s, such as &quot;Castle Walls,&quot; &quot;Superstars,&quot; &quot;Miss America&quot; and the title track, which touches on &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; of fame and fortune and how they are not what they appear.

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Malcolm Dome rated the title track as Styx all-time greatest song. He also rated &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; as the band&#x27;s 7th greatest song.

Tommy Shaw wrote the emotionally deep ballad &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot; after watching a Kansas performance in Detroit, which they had played as the opening act. He has called it &quot;Epic! Unlike any presentation of rock music I&#x27;d ever experienced. To go that big opened up all kinds of ideas in my mind, and the next time I was alone with my acoustic, the song more or less unfolded itself.&quot; The acoustic rocker’s lyrics stem from his experiences of rising to fame with Styx as well as his brother being sent off to fight in the Vietnam War, as a pawn for the strategies of politicians in Washington, D.C.

&quot;Come Sail Away&quot; uses sailing as a metaphor to achieve one&#x27;s dreams and the yearning to sail away. The lyrics touch on nostalgia of &quot;childhood friends,&quot; escapism, and a religious theme symbolized by &quot;a gathering of angels&quot; singing &quot;a song of hope.&quot; The ending lyrics explain a transformation from a sailing ship into a starship: &quot;They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies,&quot; words evoking biblical verses from Ezekiel (1:1-28). However, DeYoung revealed on &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; (which devoted an entire episode to the making of &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot;) that he was depressed when he wrote the track because Styx&#x27;s first two A&amp;M offerings, &quot;Equinox&quot; and &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;, had sold fewer units than expected after the success of the single &quot;Lady.&quot; Musically, it combines a plaintive, ballad-like opening section (including piano and synthesizer interludes) with a bombastic, guitar-heavy second half. In the middle of the second half it features a minute-long instrumental break on synthesizer, characteristic of progressive rock, after which the guitar returns with a catchy chorus.

&quot;Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)&quot; was written by Shaw. It was originally based on Shaw&#x27;s initial perception of DeYoung who was an &quot;angry young man&quot; who viewed the group&#x27;s successes with a wary eye and grew angry or depressed with every setback. It was only in later years that Shaw began to see himself in the lyrics, and the song took on a more personal meaning to him.

The title track is well known in the classic rock genre, although it was never officially released as a pop single. The closing track, &quot;The Grand Finale,&quot; combines the themes of the songs on the album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Joe Fernbacher called &quot;Miss America&quot; &quot;the most dynamic song on the album&quot; but said that it &quot;simply reeks of misogynistic misdirection.&quot; &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; critic Melanie Love called it a &quot;crunchy, hard-edged rocker from guitarist James Young&quot; and said that &quot;the snarling vocals do verge on being laughable, but it&#x27;s an entertaining track nonetheless.&quot; &quot;Daily Vault&quot; critic Christopher Thelen said that the track &quot;lost little of [its] punch over the years&quot; and has become &quot;even a stronger track as the years go by.&quot; Hamish Camp said that it &quot;continues the theme of combining the keyboard ethos of the progressive movement, with the crunching guitar riffs of their more rock-oriented peers.&quot;

<text>Crystal Ball is the sixth album by Styx, released in 1976.

This album marked the recording debut of new guitarist Tommy Shaw. The track &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; was Tommy Shaw&#x27;s vocal debut and the album&#x27;s Top-40 hit.

The album&#x27;s title track would become a concert staple for the band, as it was performed on every subsequent Styx tour with which Shaw was involved.

Claude Debussy&#x27;s classical piece &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; served as the intro to the album&#x27;s closing ballad, &quot;Ballerina&quot;. The version of &quot;Clair de Lune&quot; on &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; features only DeYoung on piano, with the key changed from D flat to C, as the next track (&quot;Ballerina&quot;) begins in C minor.

==Reception==
Crystal Ball lacked the commercial strength and chart performance of its predecessor &quot;Equinox&quot; or its follow up &quot;Grand Illusion&quot;. It peaked at #66 on the Billboard album chart, the lowest of any of the Styx A&amp;M releases. It was certified gold in 1984, 8 years after its release.

Daevid Jehnzen of AllMusic rated &quot;Crystal Ball&quot; three-and-a-half out of five stars. He stated that it was better than Styx&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Equinox&quot; (1975), although it was not as successful. He also said that the album showcases &quot;Styx&#x27;s increased skill for crafting simple, catchy pop hooks out of their bombastic sound.&quot; Alan Niester of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also found the album favorable, stating that &quot;although Styx is based in Chicago, the group has its English scam down pat&quot;. He also stated that the instrumentation &quot;always seems on the verge of going out of control, giving the whole album an extra surge of excitement.&quot;

<text>Equinox is the fifth studio album by American rock band Styx, released in December 1975. The lead single &quot;Lorelei&quot; became Styx&#x27;s second US Top 40 hit.

The album was the band&#x27;s first release for A&amp;M Records (with whom they had signed earlier in 1975, after the success of the 1973 single &quot;Lady&quot;).

The album marked the final appearance of original Styx guitarist John Curulewski who left the band to spend time with his family. Tommy Shaw replaced him.

Although &quot;Equinox&quot; stalled at number 58, it was certified Gold in 1977 shortly before the release of &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; (1977).

&quot;Record World&quot; called &quot;Light Up&quot; an &quot;uptempo effort&quot; with &quot;clean sound and infectious hooks.&quot;

<text>Edge of the Century is the twelfth studio album by Styx, released in 1990 on A&amp;M Records. It was the first Styx album featuring A&amp;M solo artist Glen Burtnik and the final album to feature drummer John Panozzo before his death in 1996. It is also their final album to be released on A&amp;M Records.

The album spawned two international singles. &quot;Show Me the Way&quot; was written by DeYoung and peaked at #3 on both the Hot 100 Pop Singles Chart and Adult Contemporary Chart. Some radio stations played a version edited with snippets of congressional debate and caller dedications to troops in the Gulf War. &quot;Love Is the Ritual,&quot; (Pop singles peak #80) written by Burtnik and Plinky Giglio, and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; (Pop singles chart peak, #25 - only released in the United States), written by Burtnik, DeYoung and Young, were also released as singles, but neither garnered the same amount of success as &quot;Show Me the Way.&quot;

The album sold more than 500,000 copies and was certified gold by the RIAA.

<text>The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter is a 1947 American comedy film directed by H.C. Potter that tells the story of a farmgirl who ends up working as a maid for a Congressman and his politically powerful mother. It stars Loretta Young, Joseph Cotten, Ethel Barrymore, and Charles Bickford, and was adapted by Allen Rivkin and Laura Kerr from the 1937 Finnish play &quot;Juurakon Hulda&quot; by Hella Wuolijoki, using the pen name Juhani Tervapää (misspelled in the film&#x27;s credits as Juhni Tervataa).

The film won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Loretta Young and was nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Charles Bickford. Young&#x27;s win was considered an upset; everyone had expected Rosalind Russell to win for her Lavinia in &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot;.

In 1963, a television series based on the film was produced, starring Inger Stevens, Cathleen Nesbitt and William Windom.

==Plot==
Swedish-American Katie Holstrom (Loretta Young) leaves the family farm to attend nursing school in Capitol City. Barn painter Adolph Petree (Rhys Williams), who completed a job for Katie&#x27;s father, offers her a ride, then steals her money along the way. Katie, refusing to ask her family for help, goes to work as a maid for political power broker Agatha Morley (Ethel Barrymore) and her son, U.S. Representative Glenn Morley (Joseph Cotten). She impresses Agatha and her loyal butler Joseph Clancey (Charles Bickford) with her refreshing, down-to-earth common sense. Glenn is impressed with her other charms.

Unexpected problems arise when the Morleys and the other leaders of their political party have to select a replacement for a deceased congressman; they choose the unscrupulous Anders J. Finley (Art Baker). Knowing the man&#x27;s true background, Katie strongly disapproves. At a public meeting to introduce Finley, Katie asks him pointed and embarrassing questions. Leaders of the opposition party are impressed and offer to back Katie in the coming election. Katie accepts and reluctantly quits her job, much to Glenn&#x27;s disappointment.

When Katie&#x27;s campaign gains support (with some coaching from Glenn), Finley smears her reputation by bribing Petree to claim Katie spent the night with him when he gave her a ride. Katie, distraught, runs home. When Glenn learns the truth, he follows her and proposes.

Agatha and Joseph get Finley drunk and he reveals he is a member of an extreme nativist political group and that he bribed Petree, who is hidden away at his isolated lodge, to disparage Katie&#x27;s reputation. Assisted by Katie&#x27;s three burly brothers (James Arness, Lex Barker, Keith Andes), Glenn retrieves Petree from his goon guards, then forces him to confess over the radio. Agatha withdraws her party&#x27;s support for Finley and endorses Katie, ensuring her election. In the final scene, Glenn carries Katie across the threshold of the United States House of Representatives.

==Cast==
In addition, Gus Stavros appears as a background extra in the film.

==Production==
Because of rumors that Joseph Cotten and Ingrid Bergman were having an affair, Bergman was replaced by Loretta Young.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on eight reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10.

<text>Possessed is a 1947 American psychological drama directed by Curtis Bernhardt, starring Joan Crawford, Van Heflin, and Raymond Massey in a tale about an unstable woman&#x27;s obsession with her ex-lover. The screenplay by Ranald MacDougall and Silvia Richards was based upon a story by Rita Weiman.

==Plot==
A woman wanders through Los Angeles, saying little more than &quot;David&quot;. Admitted to a hospital&#x27;s psychiatric ward in a catatonic stupor, and interrogated by a doctor, she calls herself Louise Howell, and recounts her life in intermittent spurts, starting with her memory of her lover David Sutton playing Schumann for her, she saying, &quot;I want to have a monopoly on you.&quot; He does not return her passion, but returns her home in a boat, and tells her their relationship is over.

She lives, and works as a nurse, at the lakeside home of the Grahams. Louise takes care of Pauline, the invalid wife of Dean Graham. Pauline is irascible and venomous, and thinks Louise is having an affair with her husband; Louise wants to leave.

Later, the police trawl the lake and find Pauline&#x27;s body. Dean says she killed herself. The Graham children, Wynn, a young boy, and a college-age young woman, Carol, return home. A coroner&#x27;s hearing is held, with a verdict of accidental death. Afterwards, Louise encounters Carol, who angrily says Pauline&#x27;s letters said Louise was attractive to Dean. Carol wants Louise to leave; Dean, who has arrived, demands Carol apologize, and slaps her.

David comes by, and says Dean&#x27;s oil business needs him as an engineer; he is hired. Louise speaks to him and thinks he has another woman, which he denies. Louise goes with the Grahams to Washington, D.C., taking care of Wynn. David happens to be there, and Louise starts drinking and looks strained; he says he is out of love with her forever, and she slaps him. She says she&#x27;ll quit her job, but Dean asks her to marry him; she agrees, even though she says she is not in love with him, which he accepts.

Louise visits Carol at college, wanting to be liked by her; there is a reconciliation. At the wedding, the uninvited David arrives late, and speaks to the crying Carol, who says she asked him for marriage at 11 years of age, which he remembers. Louise warns him away from Carol, and tells him to leave.

Later, Carol invites him over to their box at a piano recital; Louise has a distressed recollection of David at the piano, and leaves. At home, she has a lengthy hallucination: Carol returns with David, who kisses Carol. Louise confesses to killing Pauline. Carol says she&#x27;ll tell Dean; Louise hits her, and she rolls down the stairs and dies. After the hallucination ends Carol then comes home for real, but not with David.

Louise, feeling disturbed, visits a doctor under a false name, and is recommended to go to a psychiatrist, but walks out. She asks Dean for a divorce; Dean asks why, and Louise says Pauline hates her. On a vacation back at the lake house, Louise climbs to Pauline&#x27;s bedroom, screams, and when Dean runs up there, Louise says Pauline is in the room, saying to her, &quot;Kill yourself, Louise&quot;. Dean says she&#x27;s dead, and turns on the light; Louise doesn&#x27;t see her any more, but confesses to helping her kill herself. Dean says that was false, as Louise was in the village on her day off.

Back at their regular home, Louise, happy to be free of Pauline&#x27;s ghost, wants to go dancing; but she and Dean see David and Carol at the nightclub. Louise later lies to Carol that David really wants her, Louise. David drops by, and confronts Louise, who says Carol said she, Carol, is tired of David. Louise then admits lying, and that she&#x27;s willing to do anything to keep David; he threatens to tell Dean about Louise and their past.

Dean confronts Louise, and says a doctor will come see her; she gets angry that it&#x27;s a mental specialist, though she agrees to talk to him. She sneaks away to David, and says she is worried about being institutionalized. David says he will call Dean, and that he is going away that night to marry Carol. Louise gets out a gun; he taunts her, and she shoots him repeatedly.

She awakens at the hospital, and admits killing David. Dean visits, and the doctor says it is psychosis, as if she is possessed of devils, but he can restore her. He also says her tortured mind and delusion that she helped Pauline kill herself, made her present condition almost inevitable, and that if he had seen her sooner, her problems could have been averted. Re the upcoming trial about David&#x27;s death, the doctor says Louise is not responsible for any of her actions. They go see the sleeping Louise, and the doctor says the healing process will be long and difficult, and she&#x27;ll suffer a great deal before recovery. Dean pledges to help support his wife recover fully, no matter what.

==Production==
Crawford spent time visiting mental wards and talking to psychiatrists to prepare for her role, and said the part was the most difficult she ever played.

During production, director Curtis Bernhardt accidentally kept referring to Crawford as &quot;Bette&quot; as he had just finished filming &quot;A Stolen Life&quot; with Bette Davis.

Crawford tried unsuccessfully to convince Warner Bros. to change the film&#x27;s title to &quot;The Secret&quot; since she had already starred in a film of the same title (&quot;Possessed&quot; with Clark Gable as her leading man) sixteen years earlier.

The musical score is by Franz Waxman, and makes extensive use of a piano piece by Robert Schumann, the &quot;Chopin&quot; movement from &quot;Carnaval&quot; Op. 9. The Schumann piece is played on the piano by David near the beginning of the movie, and is used throughout the score to underscore Louise&#x27;s obsession with David.

==Release==
The film was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned $1,987,000 domestically and $1,085,000 in foreign territories for a worldwide total of $3,027,000.

===Critical reception===
Herman Schoenfeld of &quot;Variety&quot; positively wrote that Joan Crawford &quot;cops all thesping honors in this production with a virtuoso performance as a frustrated woman ridden into madness by a guilt-obsessed mind. Actress has a self-assurance that permits her to completely dominate the screen even vis-a-vis such accomplished players as Van Heflin and Raymond Massey.&quot; Overall, he felt that &quot;Despite its overall superiority, &quot;Possessed&quot; is somewhat marred by an ambiguous approach in Curtis Bernhardt&#x27;s direction. Film vacillates between being a cold clinical analysis of a mental crackup and a highly surcharged melodramatic vehicle for Crawford&#x27;s histrionics.&quot;

James Agee in &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Most of it is filmed with unusual imaginativeness and force. The film is uncommonly well acted. Miss Crawford is generally excellent&quot;, while Howard Barnes in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; argued, &quot;[Crawford] has obviously studied the aspects of insanity to recreate a rather terrifying portrait of a woman possessed by devils.&quot;

More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing, &quot;In German émigré director Curtis Bernhardt&#x27;s melodrama &quot;Possessed&quot;, Joan Crawford plays a mentally disturbed person who can&#x27;t distinguish reality from her imagination. Through use of German expressionism techniques and many familiar film noir shadowy shots, the b/w film takes on a penetrating psychological tone and makes a case for a not guilty of murder plea due to insanity. Though Joan has a powerful presence in this movie, she played her mad role in a too cold and campy way to be thought of as a sympathetic figure. All the psychological treatment therapy sounded like psycho-babble and Joan&#x27;s acting was overstuffed, though some of her morbid imaginations were gripping and held my attention. Too heavy with German it still is fun to watch the melodramatics play out in this tale of overbearing love, painful rejection, paranoia and murder.&quot;

Film historian Bob Porfirio notes, &quot;By developing the plot from the point-of-view of a neurotic and skillfully using flashback and fantasy scenes in a straightforward manner, the distinction between reality and Louise&#x27;s imagination is blurred. That makes &quot;Possessed&quot; a prime example of oneirism, the dreamlike tone that is a seminal characteristic of film noir.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 20th Academy Awards, Joan Crawford was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actress, losing to Loretta Young in &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

<text>Zwan was an American alternative rock supergroup formed in 2001 by lead guitarist/vocalist Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin (both of the Smashing Pumpkins). Other members included bassist Paz Lenchantin (A Perfect Circle), plus guitarists David Pajo (Slint) and Matt Sweeney (Chavez). The band released only one album, &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot; (2003), before breaking up acrimoniously that year during their world tour to promote the album. 

Following the disbanding, Corgan released a solo album, &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot; before reforming the Smashing Pumpkins in 2005, with Chamberlin joining in 2006. Despite allusions to multiple albums&#x27; worth of material written by band members, no further material has surfaced beyond their only studio album, and none of the material has been revisited in performances by any of the members outside of a brief 2017 tour by Corgan. In his 2019 solo shows, Corgan played &quot;Honestly&quot; and &quot;Endless Summer&quot; on several dates of his European summer tour.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot; (2001–2003)===
Following the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin joined forces with Matt Sweeney (formerly of the bands Chavez and Skunk) to start Zwan. Corgan had been friends with Sweeney since early in his career and Sweeney was thanked in the liner notes to The Smashing Pumpkins album &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. 
Juan Alderete was one of the musicians who auditioned for the bassist position, before Sweeney recruited David Pajo (member of Slint, Papa M, Stereolab and many Drag City acts). The band debuted as a four-piece in late 2001. Later, former A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin joined the band in 2002, and Pajo was moved to third guitarist.

Zwan had two different incarnations. The first, and more common version, the True Poets of Zwan (or simply &quot;Zwan&quot;), used three guitars, bass guitar and drums. Zwan&#x27;s only album, &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot;, is attributed to the True Poets of Zwan in the liner notes. Zwan is credited with being a bridge between the success of the Smashing Pumpkins in the 1990s and the further career developments and experimentations undertaken by Corgan in the 2000s, as well as his shift from his sombre, dark themes towards more hopeful lyrics in line with his spiritual development at the time.

Djali Zwan, an acoustic incarnation of Zwan, which also featured cellist Ana Lenchantin, Paz&#x27;s sister, was to film and record the making of a new album in the studio in the fall of 2003, with an album and DVD to be issued in early 2004. Corgan spoke with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about his plans: &quot;We&#x27;re going to do it &quot;Let It Be&quot;-style,&quot; Corgan said, referring to the documentary about the 1970 Beatles album. &quot;The album would be recorded live, with the cameras rolling. When you get the DVD, you can watch the takes on the album being done.&quot; He described the songs he&#x27;d written for Djali Zwan as &quot;more folk-driven, rooted in traditional music. I don&#x27;t want to compromise veins of material to fit into an electric band, which I often did in the Pumpkins. With Djali Zwan, I can write an acoustic song and not worry how it&#x27;s going to stand up against some rock epic.&quot;

Billy Corgan, Linda Strawberry, and Matt Sweeney came together to create the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Spun&quot;, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, and were credited as The Djali Zwan.

===Break-up (2003)===
Billy Corgan announced the band had broken up on Chicago&#x27;s WGN, on September 15, 2003. &quot;I really enjoyed my experience with Zwan, but at the end of the day, without that sense of deeper family loyalty, it just becomes like anything else,&quot; Corgan said.

On April 24, 2005, in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Corgan commented briefly on the breakup of the band: &quot;The music wasn&#x27;t the big problem, it was more their attitude... Sex acts between band members in public. People carrying drugs across borders. Pajo sleeping with the producer&#x27;s girlfriend while we were making the record.&quot;

In the May 27, 2005 edition of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Corgan elaborated on his version of what went wrong:

Corgan also stated that he can no longer listen to &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot;, because to him it sounds like &quot;thousands of lies upon lies upon lies. It&#x27;s a shame because there&#x27;s tons of music unreleased that will just sit in a box until I can stomach it.&quot; When asked which of his two former bands would ever reform, he said, &quot;Pumpkins. You&#x27;ll never see Zwan. I&#x27;ll never go anywhere near those people. Ever. I mean, I detest them. You can put that in capital letters. Bad people. James and D&#x27;arcy are good people. They might be misguided people, but they&#x27;re good people.&quot;

A decade after Zwan&#x27;s demise, Corgan&#x27;s stance would soften regarding performance of its material. He included Zwan songs in a set of mostly Smashing Pumpkins material during a solo show in August 2014, and the following year announced a Smashing Pumpkins acoustic tour that would also incorporate Zwan material in its sets. Zwan songs were also featured in Corgan&#x27;s tour to support his 2017 solo album, &quot;Ogilala&quot;.

Matt Sweeney, who initiated the band with Corgan, said in 2017, &quot;We had a friendship from before he was famous. One on one, we had a pretty great thing going. We had a great year where we made like a hundred songs. Nobody&#x27;s ever heard that stuff. But once it went public, everything was different. I was confused, it started to feel like fulfilling a commitment where the game had changed. It was interesting, I&#x27;m still sort of unpacking that experience. We all had to sign confidentiality agreements, so I can&#x27;t really talk about it.&quot; David Pajo was also still negative about the band as of 2017.

==Musical style==
Zwan&#x27;s debut and only album was described as &quot;an efficient exercise in the kind of American alternative rock with big choruses that makes the boys at the front jump up and down.&quot; The band&#x27;s style is mostly pop-orientated and closer to mainstream pop rock, evoking &quot;the candied pop that characterised much of the Pumpkins&#x27; later work.&quot; Nevertheless, the songs also contrast with late Pumpkins material, being described as a &quot;bright blast of tuneful guitar rock, as effervescent as the late Pumpkins material was gloomy.&quot; In addition to being considered as power pop, the band&#x27;s work also features guitarist David Pajo&#x27;s post-rock textures.

<text>William Patrick Corgan Jr. (born March 17, 1967) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, and professional wrestling promoter. He is best known as the co-founder, lead guitarist, primary songwriter, singer, and only constant member of alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan is credited with helping popularize the alt rock genre. He has also been the owner and promoter of the National Wrestling Alliance since 2017.

Corgan formed the Smashing Pumpkins in Chicago in 1988 alongside guitarist James Iha, with bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin joining soon after. Strong album sales and large-scale tours propelled the band to commercial success and critical acclaim throughout the 1990s. After their break-up in 2000, Corgan and Chamberlin started a new band called Zwan; after the band&#x27;s demise, he released the collection of poetry &quot;Blinking with Fists&quot; (2004) and the solo album &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot; (2005) before reforming Smashing Pumpkins in 2007. The new version of the band, consisting of Corgan and a revolving lineup, has released new albums and toured extensively. In October 2017, Corgan released &quot;Ogilala&quot;, his first solo album in over a decade. His latest solo album, &quot;Cotillions&quot;, was released in 2019.

Corgan co-founded Resistance Pro Wrestling in 2011. He joined TNA Wrestling in 2015 and became its president in 2016, but left a few months later. He purchased the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in 2017; thereafter, Corgan made it his primary focus in professional wrestling.

==Early life==
William Patrick Corgan Jr. was born at Columbus Hospital in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago on March 17, 1967, the oldest child of Martha Louise Maes Corgan Lutz and guitarist William Dale Corgan (1947–2021). He grew up Catholic and has a younger brother. His parents divorced in 1970. Billy said he went to live with his great-grandmother, then his grandmother. Next he and his brother went to live with his father and new wife (a flight attendant whom his father had remarried) in Glendale Heights, Illinois, a Chicago suburb 22 miles west of the city. His father was a musician and was often away; when Billy was nine his father and stepmother (whom Billy considers to be his mother) split. Billy grew up an hour away from both of his natural parents.

Billy alleges that his stepmother was abusive to him, both physically and emotionally. He developed a protective bond with his younger paternal half-brother, Jesse, who had special needs as a child. When Billy&#x27;s father and stepmother separated, all three boys lived alone with their stepmother. Billy said his father was a &quot;drug dealing, gun-toting musician [and] mad man&quot;. Although William Corgan Sr. negatively impacted his son&#x27;s childhood, Corgan said he came to have tremendous respect for his father&#x27;s musicianship.

Corgan, who grew much faster than his fellow students, was a strong athlete in elementary school. In addition to being a member of his baseball team at Marquardt Middle School, he amassed over 10,000 baseball cards and listened to every Chicago Cubs game on the radio. However, by the time he began attending Glenbard North High School, his athletic prowess had greatly diminished. He decided to start playing guitar after seeing a Flying V when he went over to a friend&#x27;s house.

Corgan gave his savings to his father, who bought him a used Les Paul knock-off. His father encouraged him to listen to Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix but offered little other support, so Corgan taught himself. His musical interests in high school included hard rock music like &quot;Guts&quot;-era John Cale, heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, and mainstream rock like Van Halen, Queen, Boston, ELO, Rush, and Cheap Trick. Corgan discovered the alternative rock genre by listening to Bauhaus and The Cure. He performed in a string of bands in high school and graduated as an honor student. Despite grant and scholarship offers from a number of schools, and a tuition fund left by his grandmother, Corgan decided to pursue music full-time.

==Music career==
===1985–1987: Early career===
Not finding the Chicago music scene to his liking, Corgan moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1985 with his first major band, The Marked (named for the conspicuous birthmarks of both Corgan and drummer Ron Roesing). Not finding success in St. Petersburg, the band dissolved; Corgan moved back to Chicago and lived with his father. From 1987 to 1988, he played guitar in Chicago band Deep Blue Dream, which also featured future Static-X frontman Wayne Static. He left the band to focus on The Smashing Pumpkins.

===1988–2000: The Smashing Pumpkins===

Upon his return to Chicago, Corgan had already devised his next project – a band that would be called The Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan met guitarist James Iha while working in a record store, and the two began recording demos, which Corgan describes as &quot;gloomy little goth-pop records&quot;. He met bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky after a local show, arguing with her about a band that had just played, The Dan Reed Network. Soon after, the Smashing Pumpkins were formed. The trio began to play together at local clubs with a drum machine for percussion. To secure a show at the Metro in Chicago, the band recruited drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, and played for the first time as a quartet on October 5, 1988.
The addition of Chamberlin drove the band in a heavier direction almost immediately. On the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Gish&quot; (1991), the band integrated psychedelic rock and heavy metal into their sound. &quot;Gish&quot; fared better than expected, but the follow-up, &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;, released on Virgin Records in 1993, became a multi-platinum hit. The band became known for internal drama during this period, with Corgan frequently characterized in the music press as a &quot;control freak&quot; due to rumors that he played all the guitar and bass parts on &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; (a rumor that Corgan later confirmed as true). Despite this, the album was well received by critics, and the songs &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, and &quot;Disarm&quot; became hits.

The band&#x27;s 1995 follow-up effort, the double album &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;, was even more successful, spawning a string of hit singles. According to Jon Pareles from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Corgan wanted to &quot;lose himself and find himself...&quot; in this album. The album was nominated for seven Grammy awards that year, and would eventually be certified ten times platinum in the United States. The song &quot;1979&quot; was Corgan&#x27;s biggest hit to date, reaching No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s modern rock and mainstream rock charts. Their appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 11, 1995, to promote this material (their second appearance on the show overall) was also the television debut appearance of Corgan&#x27;s shaved head, which he has maintained consistently since.

On July 12, 1996, touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin died in a Manhattan hotel room of a heroin overdose after he and Chamberlin used the drug together. Chamberlin was later arrested on a misdemeanor drug possession charge. The Smashing Pumpkins made the decision to fire Chamberlin and continue as a trio. This shakeup, coupled with Corgan going through a divorce and the death of his mother, influenced the somber mood of the band&#x27;s next album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Adore&quot;. Featuring a darker, more subdued and heavily electronic sound at a time when alternative rock was declining in mainstream cachet, &quot;Adore&quot; divided both critics and fans, resulting in a significant decrease in album sales (it sold 1.3 million in the US).
Chamberlin was reunited with the band in 1999. In 2000, they released &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;, a concept album on which the band deliberately played to their public image. Critics were again divided, and sales were lower than before; &quot;Machina&quot; is the second lowest-selling commercially released Smashing Pumpkins album to date, with U.S. sales of 583,000 units up to 2005. During the recording for &quot;Machina&quot;, Wretzky quit the band and was replaced for the upcoming tour by former Hole bassist Melissa Auf der Maur. In 2000 the band released &quot;Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music&quot; free over the Internet and broke up at the end of the year, playing their last show on December 2, 2000, at the Cabaret Metro.

===2001–2005: Zwan and solo career===
Following a brief stint touring with New Order in the summer, Corgan reunited with Chamberlin to form the band Zwan with Corgan&#x27;s old friend Matt Sweeney in late 2001. According to Neil Strauss of New York Times, during his few live performances with the band, Corgan says this &quot;is still a work in progress&quot;. The lineup was completed with guitarist David Pajo and bassist Paz Lenchantin. The band had two distinct incarnations, the primary approach being an upbeat rock band with a three-guitar-driven sound, the second, a folk and gospel inspired acoustic side with live strings. The quintet performed throughout 2002, and their debut album, &quot;Mary Star of the Sea&quot;, was released in early 2003 to generally positive reviews. In the midst of their supporting tour for the album, mounting conflict between Corgan and Chamberlin and the other band members led to the cancellation of the rest of the tour as the band entered an apparent hiatus, formally breaking up in September 2003.

In 2004, Corgan began writing revealing autobiographical posts on his website and his MySpace page, blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins, calling Wretzky &quot;a mean spirited drug addict,&quot; and criticizing his former Zwan bandmates&#x27; fixation with &quot;indie cred&quot; and calling them &quot;filthy&quot;, opportunistic, and selfish.

On September 17, 2003, Billy presented his poetry at the Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s Rubloff Auditorium. In late 2004, Corgan published &quot;Blinking with Fists&quot;, a book of poetry. Despite mixed reviews, the book debuted on The New York Times Best Seller list. Around this time, he began posting autobiographical writings online under the title &quot;The Confessions of Billy Corgan&quot;.

Also in 2004, he began a solo music career, landing on an electronic/shoegaze/alternative rock sound for his first solo album, &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot;, co-produced and arranged by Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb. Released on June 21, 2005, through Reprise Records, it garnered mixed reviews from the press and only sold 69,000 copies. Corgan toured behind his solo album with a touring band that included Linda Strawberry, Brian Liesegang and Matt Walker in 2005. This tour was not as extensive as previous Smashing Pumpkins or Zwan tours. The tour was also controversial in Australia, with Corgan antagonising the audience and storming off the stage when Smashing Pumpkins songs were yelled out as requests. Prior to recording &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot;, Corgan had recorded some 72 songs inspired by Chicago history for the largely acoustic &quot;ChicagoSongs&quot; project, which have yet to be released.

===2005–present: The Smashing Pumpkins revival===
In 2005, Corgan took out a full-page ad in Chicago&#x27;s two major newspapers (&quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot;) revealing his desire to re-form the Smashing Pumpkins. Several days later, Jimmy Chamberlin accepted Corgan&#x27;s offer for a reunion.

On April 20, 2006, the band&#x27;s official website confirmed that the group was reuniting. The re-formed Smashing Pumpkins went into studio for much of 2006 and early 2007, and performed its first show in seven years on May 22, 2007, with new members Ginger Pooley (bass) and Jeff Schroeder (guitar) replacing Wretzky and Iha. The new album, titled &quot;Zeitgeist,&quot; was released in the United States on July 10, 2007, and debuted at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Corgan and the rest of the Pumpkins toured extensively throughout 2007 and 2008, also releasing the EP &quot;American Gothic&quot; and the singles &quot;G.L.O.W.&quot; and &quot;Superchrist&quot;. Chamberlin left the band in March 2009, and Corgan chose to continue under the name.

In summer 2009, Corgan formed the band Spirits in the Sky to play a tribute concert to the late Sky Saxon of the Seeds. He toured with the band, composed of ex-Catherine member and &quot;Superchrist&quot; producer Kerry Brown, the Electric Prunes bassist Mark Tulin, Strawberry Alarm Clock keyboardist Mark Weitz, frequent Corgan collaborator Linda Strawberry, flautist Kevin Dippold, &quot;Superchrist&quot; violinist Ysanne Spevack, saxist Justin Norman, new Pumpkins drummer Mike Byrne, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, playing covers and new Pumpkins material at several clubs in California. At the end of the tour, Corgan, Byrne, Tulin, and Brown headed back to Chicago to begin work on the new Smashing Pumpkins album, &quot;Teargarden by Kaleidyscope&quot;. The lineup at the time which included new bassist Nicole Fiorentino, toured through much of 2010, then spent 2011 recording the &quot;album-within-an-album&quot; &quot;Oceania&quot; and mounting tours of the United States and Europe. However, Byrne and Fiorentino would later leave the band in 2014.

On May 15, 2014, Corgan released &quot;AEGEA&quot;, a new solo record of experimental recordings he made in 2007. Limited to 250 vinyl copies, the album was mostly sold online, with a few copies sold at Madame Zuzu&#x27;s, a tea house he owns and operates in Highland Park, a suburb northwest of Chicago. On July 25, 2014, Corgan also released the tapes from his &quot;Siddhartha&quot; show from March 2014, much in the vein of &quot;AEGEA.&quot; The set was expected to contain between 5 and 6 discs. During the summer 2014, he recorded The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Monuments to an Elegy,&quot; with Tommy Lee and Jeff Schroeder. The album was released in early December 2014.

In October 2017, he released a new solo album titled &quot;Ogilala.&quot;
In July 2018, The Smashing Pumpkins embarked on a reunion tour, the Shiny and Oh So Bright Tour, with a focus on performing material from their first five studio albums. The lineup consists of himself, James Iha, Jimmy Chamberlin, and Jeff Schroeder. Former bassist D&#x27;arcy Wretzky was not a part of the lineup, reportedly due to unresolved tension between her and Corgan. Wretzky has stated that Corgan offered her a contract but later retracted the offer, saying that &quot;we also have to balance the forces at play... there is no room for error.&quot; After Wretzky released text messages between her and Corgan, a feud ensued, with each party attacking each other with biting remarks.

On November 22, 2019, Corgan released his third solo album &quot;Cotillions&quot;, which he called &quot;a labor of love&quot;. He also said, &quot;This is absolutely an album from my heart.&quot; On July 14, 2022, he and his partner, Chloe Mendel, announced that they would host a livestream charity show on July 27 to benefit the victims of the July 4 Highland Park, Illinois, shooting.

==Professional wrestling promoter==
===Resistance Pro Wrestling (2011–2014)===
In 2011, Corgan formed a Chicago-based independent wrestling promotion called Resistance Pro. Two years later, in 2013, he starred in a commercial for Walter E. Smithe Furniture, using the platform to promote his wrestling company.

In March 2014, it was reported that Corgan was in discussions with American television channel AMC to develop an unscripted reality series about Resistance Pro. The premise being a behind-the-scenes look at the promotion as Corgan &quot;takes over creative direction for the independent wrestling company&quot;. The show was given the green light by AMC, under the working title of &quot;Untitled Billy Corgan Wrestling Project,&quot; the same month.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2015–2016)===
In April 2015, Corgan became the new Senior Producer of Creative and Talent Development for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where his role was to &quot;develop characters and create story lines&quot;, which he has called &quot;a dream come true&quot;. In August 2016, Corgan took over as the promotion&#x27;s new president.

In November 2016, Corgan had left TNA after disputes about not being paid on time, and subsequently, Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment Corp and Impact Ventures, parent company of TNA Impact Wrestling, provided a credit facility to TNA to fund operations. In 2016, he loaned money to Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment to fund TNA, and they promised to pay him back. On November 11, Corgan and Anthem signed a settlement, with Anthem repaying TNA&#x27;s loan from Corgan.

Newly appointed TNA/Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Matt Hardy &quot;Broken&quot; gimmick to Jeremy Borash, David Lagana and Billy Corgan. While Borash specifically had the most input into the gimmick of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the gimmick.

===National Wrestling Alliance (2017–present)===
In May 2017, Corgan purchased the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), including its name, rights, trademarks and championship belts. Corgan&#x27;s ownership took effect on October 1, 2017.

==Personal life==
===Mental health===
For much of his life, Corgan has struggled with anxiety, depression, panic attacks, self-harm, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidal ideation. He attributes these problems to the abuse he endured as a child at the hands of his father and stepmother, as well as other personal issues. He has since become an advocate for abuse support networks.

===Involvement with sports===
Corgan is an avid fan of the Chicago Cubs; he is also an occasional commentator on the team for WXRT DJ Lin Brehmer. He has appeared at many Cubs games, occasionally throwing the ceremonial first pitch or singing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;. He is also a fan of the Chicago Bulls, Chicago Blackhawks and Chicago Bears, and became personal friends with Dennis Rodman and Chris Chelios. He is an avid professional wrestling fan, and appeared at an ECW event wielding an acoustic guitar as a weapon. In 2008, the Pumpkins song &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot; was used by ROH for promotional videos. On April 26, 2010, Corgan appeared on the SIRIUS Satellite Radio program &quot;Right After Wrestling&quot; with Arda Ocal to discuss his love for wrestling and the importance of unique theme songs for characters. On August 26, 2010, he took part in a storyline with AAA during a concert for MTV World Stage. As far as other entertainment, Corgan once commented that all he watches on TV are &quot;sports and the Three Stooges&quot;. In March 2008, he was spotted in the crowd at the final day of a cricket test match between New Zealand and England. In 2017, Corgan purchased NWA.

===Spiritual beliefs===
Corgan accepts some elements of Catholicism, Buddhism, and Ken Wilber&#x27;s spiritual ideas. In 2009, he launched Everything From Here to There, an interfaith website that is devoted to &quot;Mind-Body-Soul&quot; integration. He mentions praying each morning and night to be able to see through Jesus Christ&#x27;s eyes and feel with his heart. An analysis of the symbolism of Corgan&#x27;s lyrics considered the blend of beliefs he has cited in various interviews, which include ideas about religion, multiple dimensions, and psychic phenomena. In an interview on the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot;, Corgan said he had an encounter with a person who had the ability to shapeshift.

===Family and romantic relationships===
Corgan&#x27;s mother Martha died in December 1996. The song &quot;For Martha&quot;, from &quot;Adore&quot;, was written in her memory. In the early 2000s Corgan named his label Martha&#x27;s Music after her as well. A picture of Martha as a young girl sitting on a fake moon at Riverview Park is featured on the flipside of the &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; booklet.

In 1991, Corgan briefly dated musician and actress Courtney Love. In an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Corgan confessed that he arranged for Love&#x27;s band to stay in his Chicago apartment in order to meet her, an encounter he had longed for after seeing her photograph on the back of Hole&#x27;s new single. Their relationship ended on October 12, 1991, when Love found out that Corgan had another relationship.

In 1993, Corgan married art conservator and artist Chris Fabian, his longtime on-again, off-again girlfriend. They were married at a small ceremony at his house in Wrigleyville. Corgan and Fabian separated in late 1995. Corgan filed for divorce in December 1996 on grounds of &quot;irreconcilable differences,&quot; and the divorce was granted in 1997. Corgan refused to discuss the marriage for years, only allowing that it was &quot;unhappy.&quot; In 2005 he described the circumstances of his marriage in depth via his personal blog.

In late 1995, Corgan started dating Ukrainian photographer Yelena Yemchuk, who later contributed to several Smashing Pumpkins videos and album art. He continued to date Yemchuk until around 2004. According to Corgan, his breakup with her contributed to the themes of his 2005 solo release &quot;TheFutureEmbrace&quot;. In 2005, Corgan dated musician Emilie Autumn for a number of months. The pair collaborated on multiple occasions during this time, with Autumn providing vocals and violin on his solo album and costume for a supporting music video.

In early 2006, Corgan moved in with Love and her daughter Frances Bean Cobain. According to Love, he had his own wing in her Hollywood Hills mansion. Two years later, Love criticized him publicly over his alleged refusal to attend her daughter&#x27;s sweet 16 party. After they parted ways, Corgan stated in a March 2010 interview, &quot;I have no interest in supporting [Love] in any way, shape or form. You can&#x27;t throw enough things down the abyss with a person like that.&quot; Shortly after, when her band&#x27;s album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was released, Corgan used Twitter to post anger-filled rants against her in reference to two songs he had written, &quot;Samantha&quot; and &quot;How Dirty Girls Get Clean&quot;, which ended up on the album without his permission. Love then wrote an apology to him on her Facebook account, but the feud continued. Corgan took to Twitter to rant against her again. She responded to him on Twitter, saying, &quot;All i am is nice about you so if you wanna be mean be mean i don&#x27;t feel anything. i have too much to feel dear.&quot; In 2008, he blamed his dedication to music for what he called &quot;a bad marriage and seven bad girlfriends in a row&quot;. The two eventually reconciled, and Love was invited to perform at Smashing Pumpkins 30th Anniversary Show. In 2020, Corgan told the Los Angeles Times that only a few people really matter to him and that Courtney is one of them, describing their relationship as a family bond.

In 2009, Corgan was linked with pop star Jessica Simpson. He started dating Australian singer Jessica Origliasso in 2010, and remained in a relationship with her until early June 2012. Origliasso blamed their split on their careers forcing them to spend too much time apart.

He began dating Chloe Mendel in 2013. She gave birth to a son on November 16, 2015. Their second child, a daughter, was born on October 2, 2018.
On September 17, 2023, during the 30th anniversary Siamese Dream show at Madame Zuzu&#x27;s, Billy announced that he had married Chloe the day before, on September 16.

On December 19, 2021, Corgan&#x27;s father, William Dale Corgan, died at age 74.

===Political beliefs===
In 1998, Corgan said that he had not participated in an election since 1992, when he voted for Bill Clinton.
After the election of Barack Obama in 2008, Corgan said, &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of my country right now for doing the right thing.&quot; He has since said that he was disappointed with Obama&#x27;s presidency, and that he lacks faith in both major political parties. In 2009, he posted a transcript of a webcast by political activist Lyndon LaRouche to the official Smashing Pumpkins forum. On March 10, 2009, Corgan testified in front of Congress on behalf of the musicFIRST Coalition. He spoke in favor of H.R. 848, the Performance Rights Act, which gives musicians and artists their share of compensation when their music is played on radio stations.

In an interview with radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in 2016, Corgan voiced discontent with &quot;social justice warriors&quot;, comparing them to Maoists, cult members, and the Ku Klux Klan, and calling their actions a threat to freedom of speech. In 2018, he called himself a &quot;free-market libertarian capitalist&quot;.

===Diet===

Corgan adopted a pescetarian diet in 2013, and stated in 2017 that he had begun following a vegan and gluten-free diet. In 2012, he opened a tea house in Ravinia, Highland Park called Madame Zuzu&#x27;s Tea House; the tea house closed in 2018 and reopened in downtown Highland Park in 2020.

==Collaborations==
In addition to performing, Corgan has produced albums for Ric Ocasek, The Frogs, and Catherine. He shared songwriting credit on several songs on Hole&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;; the title track became Corgan&#x27;s second No. 1 modern rock hit. He also acted as a consultant for Marilyn Manson during the recording of the album &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;. He has produced three soundtracks for the movies &quot;Ransom&quot; (1996), &quot;Stigmata&quot; (1999) and &quot;Spun&quot; (2002) in which he appeared as a doctor.

Corgan appeared at the 1996 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremonies. He inducted one of his biggest musical influences, Pink Floyd. He played acoustic guitar during the ceremony with Pink Floyd, when they performed their song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

In particular, Corgan guided and collaborated with three bands in the 2000s—Breaking Benjamin (during sessions for 2004&#x27;s &quot;We Are Not Alone&quot;), Taproot (for &quot;Blue-Sky Research&quot;, 2005), and Sky Saxon.

In 2010, Corgan claimed co-writing credit (with ex-girlfriend Courtney Love) on at least two of the songs on Hole&#x27;s final album &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and tried to assert a right of approval before the album could be released. Corgan had helped develop the album during its early stages. The album was released without the writing controversy ever being litigated or publicly resolved.

Corgan appeared as a guest vocalist on the song &quot;Loki Cat&quot; on Jimmy Chamberlin&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Life Begins Again&quot;, and Chamberlin played drums for the song &quot;DIA&quot; on Corgan&#x27;s solo debut, where Robert Smith from The Cure teamed up with Corgan to do a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;To Love Somebody&quot;. In 2007, Corgan provided vocals on the Scorpions&#x27; song &quot;The Cross&quot;, on their album &quot;&quot;. In 2010 Corgan featured on Ray Davies&#x27; album See My Friends on the album&#x27;s closer, a mash-up of the Kinks songs &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; and &quot;Destroyer&quot;. He also contributed his guitar work on &quot;Did You Miss Me&quot; by The Veronicas. Corgan has also collaborated with Tony Iommi, Blindside, David Bowie (singing &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; with Bowie at Bowie&#x27;s 50th birthday party), New Order and Marianne Faithfull.

==Musical style and influences==
When asked in a 1994 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview about his influences, Corgan replied:

Corgan wrote six articles for &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 1995, and his solos for &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and &quot;Geek U.S.A.&quot; were included on their list of the top guitar solos of all time. AllMusic said &quot;Starla&quot; &quot;proves that Corgan was one of the finest (and most underrated) rock guitarists of the &#x27;90s&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called him and his Smashing Pumpkins bandmates &quot;ruthless virtuosos&quot;. His solo for &quot;Soma&quot; was No. 24 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the top guitar solos. He is a fan of Eddie Van Halen and interviewed him in 1996 for &quot;Guitar World&quot;. Other guitarists Corgan rates highly include Uli Jon Roth, Tony Iommi, Ritchie Blackmore, Leslie West, Dimebag Darrell and Robin Trower.

His bass playing, which has featured on nearly every Smashing Pumpkins album, was influenced by post-punk figures like Peter Hook and Simon Gallup.

Corgan has praised Radiohead, saying &quot;if they&#x27;re not the best band in the world, then they&#x27;re one of the best&quot;. He is also a fan of Pantera and appeared briefly in their home video 3 Watch It Go. Other favorites include Depeche Mode, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Rush, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Cure, Metallica, Slayer, Queen, Electric Light Orchestra, Dinosaur Jr., My Bloody Valentine, and Spiritualized. Corgan stated in 1997 that upon hearing the U2 song &quot;New Year&#x27;s Day&quot;, at 16, &quot;[U2] quickly became the most important band in the world to me.&quot; Corgan particularly went out of his way to praise Rush in his interview for &quot;&quot;, a documentary on the band, where he criticized mainstream reviewers for consciously marginalizing the band and their influence, and highlighted the fact that many of his musical peers were influenced by Rush.

He has listed his artistic influences as William S. Burroughs, Pablo Picasso, Jimi Hendrix, Jack Kerouac, and Philip K. Dick.

==Instruments==

During the &quot;Gish&quot;-&quot;Siamese Dream&quot; era, Corgan played acustomized &#x27;57 Reissue Fender Stratocaster equipped with three Fender Lace Sensor pickups (the Lace Sensor Blue in the neck position, the Lace Sensor Silver in the middle position, and the Lace Sensor Red at the bridge position). It also has a five-position pickup selector switch which he installed himself. This battered Strat became his number one guitar by default. He owned a &#x27;74 Strat that was stolen shortly after &quot;Gish&quot; was completed. Corgan was reunited with this guitar in early 2019.

Corgan also used a wide variety of guitars on &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot;. On &quot;Where Boys Fear to Tread&quot;, Corgan used a Les Paul Junior Reissue, and on &quot;Tonight Tonight&quot; he used a &#x27;72 Gibson ES-335. He is also known to use a &#x27;74 Strat which has since been painted baby blue. That guitar was used on the recordings for &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; and also &quot;Muzzle&quot;, because the heavier wood gave it the basic Strat sound with a bit more bottom. During the recording and tour of the album &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, he used a Schecter C-1 EX baritone, finished in black with Tony Iommi signature pickups. Corgan endorsed Reverend Guitars in his &quot;Zwan&quot; era, most notably playing a Reverend Slingshot.

In 2008, Corgan released to the market his own Fender Stratocaster. This new guitar was made to Corgan&#x27;s exact specs to create his famous mid-&#x27;90s buzzsaw tone; the instrument features three DiMarzio pickups (two custom for this instrument), a string-through hardtail bridge and a satin nitrocellulose lacquer finish. When playing live, he uses both his signature Strats as well as two other Fender Strats, one in red with a white pick guard and one in silver-grey with a black pick guard; a Gibson Tony Iommi signature SG; and his Schecter C-1 (only used on the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; song &quot;United States&quot;).

A video called &#x27;Stompland&#x27; on the official Smashing Pumpkins YouTube channel is informative about Corgan&#x27;s choice of effects pedals. In the video he reveals an extensive collection of pedals used throughout his career with the Smashing Pumpkins. Corgan&#x27;s tone is often characterized by his use of fuzz pedals, particularly vintage versions of the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff

In 2016, Reverend Guitars released the BC-1 Billy Corgan signature guitar featuring Railhammer Billy Corgan signature pickups. The Reverend Billy Corgan Signature Terz was launched at the 2018 NAMM Show—an electric version of a 19th-century instrument that is played as if the guitar is capoed at the third fret, and tuned G-g standard. Corgan often uses the capo at the third fret and asked for a higher-register guitar.

Corgan is noted for having used Marshall and Diezel amps. He has also used modular preamps based on many different amps in conjunction with Mesa Boogie poweramps. The preamps were custom built by Salvation Mods. In August 2017, he sold a large collection of instruments and gear used throughout his career via music gear website Reverb.

In 2020, Billy Corgan collaborated with Brian Carstens of Carstens Amplification to produce Grace, Corgan&#x27;s first and only signature guitar amplifier to date.

<text>Susan Hayward (born Edythe Marrenner; June 30, 1917 – March 14, 1975) was an American actress best known for her film portrayals of women that were based on true stories.

After working as a fashion model for the Walter Thornton Model Agency, Hayward traveled to Hollywood in 1937 to audition for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara. She secured a film contract and played several small supporting roles over the next few years.

By the late 1940s, the quality of her film roles improved, and she achieved recognition for her dramatic abilities with the first of five Academy Award for Best Actress nominations for her performance as an alcoholic in &quot;Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman&quot; (1947). Hayward&#x27;s success continued through the 1950s as she received nominations for &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (1949), &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (1952), and &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot; (1955), winning the Academy Award for her portrayal of death row inmate Barbara Graham in &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958). For her performance in &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot; she won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actress.

After Hayward&#x27;s second marriage and subsequent move to Georgia, her film appearances became infrequent; although she continued acting in film and television until 1972. She died in 1975 of brain cancer.

==Early life==
Hayward was born Edythe Marrenner on June 30, 1917, in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of three children to Ellen (née Pearson) and Walter Marrenner. Her mother was of Swedish descent. She had an older sister, Florence, and an older brother, Walter Jr. In 1924, Marrenner was hit by a car, suffering a fractured hip and broken legs that put her in a partial body cast with the resulting bone setting leaving her with a distinctive hip swivel later in life.

She was educated at Public School 181 and graduated from the Girls&#x27; Commercial High School in June 1935 (later renamed Prospect Heights High School). According to the Erasmus Hall High School alumni page, Hayward attended that school in the mid-1930s, although she only recollected swimming at the pool for a dime during hot summers in Flatbush, Brooklyn. During her high school years, she acted in various school plays, and was named &quot;Most Dramatic&quot; by her class.

==Career==
Marrenner began her career as a model, traveling to Hollywood in 1937 to try out for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Though Hayward did not get the part, she was used for other actors&#x27; screen tests by David Selznick and received a contract at Warner Bros.

===Warner Bros.===
Talent agent Max Arnow changed Marrenner&#x27;s name to Susan Hayward once she started her six-month contract for $50 a week with Warner&#x27;s. Hayward had bit parts in &quot;Hollywood Hotel&quot; (1937), &quot;The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse&quot; (1938) (her part was edited out), and &quot;The Sisters&quot; (1938), as well as in a short, &quot;Campus Cinderella&quot; (1938).

Hayward&#x27;s first sizeable role was with Ronald Reagan in &quot;Girls on Probation&quot; (1938), where she was a strong 10th in billing. She was also in &quot;Comet Over Broadway&quot; (1938), but returned to unbilled and began posing for pinup &quot;cheesecake&quot; publicity photos, something she and most actresses despised, but under her contract she had no choice. With Hayward&#x27;s contract at Warner Bros. finished, she moved on to Paramount Studios.

===Paramount===
In 1939, Paramount Studios signed her to a $250 per week contract. Hayward had her first breakthrough in the part of Isobel in &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939) opposite Gary Cooper and Ray Milland. She held the small, but important, haunting love of youth role as recalled by the Geste brothers while they searched for a valuable sapphire known as &quot;the blue water&quot; during desert service in the Foreign Legion; the film was hugely successful.

Paramount put Hayward as the second lead in &quot;Our Leading Citizen&quot; (1939) with Bob Burns and she then supported Joe E. Brown in &quot;$1000 a Touchdown&quot; (1939).

Hayward went to Columbia for a supporting role alongside Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Adam Had Four Sons&quot; (1941), then to Republic Pictures for &quot;Sis Hopkins&quot; (1941) with Judy Canova and Bob Crosby. Back at Paramount, she had the lead in a &quot;B&quot; film, &quot;Among the Living&quot; (1941) alongside Albert Dekker and Frances Farmer.

Cecil B. De Mille gave her a good supporting role in &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; (1942), to costar with Milland, John Wayne and Paulette Goddard. She was in the short &quot;A Letter from Bataan&quot; (1942) and supported Goddard and Fred MacMurray in &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot; (1942).
===United Artists and Republic===
Hayward costarred in &quot;I Married a Witch&quot; (1942) with Fredric March and Veronica Lake, as the fiancé of Wallace Wooly (March) before Lake&#x27;s witch reappears from a Puritanical stake burning 300 years earlier. The film served as inspiration for the 1960s TV series &quot;Bewitched&quot; and was based on an unfinished novel by Thorne Smith. It was made for Paramount but was sold to United Artists. She was next in Paramount&#x27;s all-star musical review &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot; (1943) that also featured its nonmusical contract players.

Hayward appeared with William Holden in &quot;Young and Willing&quot; (1943), a Paramount film distributed by UA. She was in Republic&#x27;s &quot;Hit Parade of 1943&quot; (1943), her singing voice dubbed by Jeanne Darrell.

Sam Bronston borrowed her for &quot;Jack London&quot; (1943) at UA. At Republic she was Wayne&#x27;s love interest in &quot;The Fighting Seabees&quot; (1944), the biggest budgeted film in that company&#x27;s history.

She starred in the film version of &quot;The Hairy Ape&quot; (1944) for UA. Back at Paramount she was Loretta Young&#x27;s sister in &quot;And Now Tomorrow&quot; (1944). She then left the studio.

RKO gave Hayward her first top billing in &quot;Deadline at Dawn&quot; (1946), a Clifford Odets written Noir film, which was Harold Clurman&#x27;s only movie as director.

===Walter Wanger and stardom===
After the war, Hayward&#x27;s career took off when producer Walter Wanger signed her for a seven-year contract at $100,000 a year. Her first film was &quot;Canyon Passage&quot; (1946).

In 1947, she received the first of five Academy Award nominations for her role as an alcoholic nightclub singer based on Dixie Lee in &quot;Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman&quot;, her second film for Wanger. Although it was not well received by critics, it was popular with audiences and a box office success, launching Hayward as a star.

RKO used her again for &quot;They Won&#x27;t Believe Me&quot; (1947). She subsequently worked for Wanger on &quot;The Lost Moment&quot; (1948) and &quot;Tap Roots&quot; (1948). Both films lost money but the latter was widely seen.

At Universal Hayward was in &quot;The Saxon Charm&quot; (1948) and she did &quot;Tulsa&quot; (1949) for Wanger. Both films were commercial disappointments.

===20th Century Fox===
Hayward went over to 20th Century Fox to make &quot;House of Strangers&quot; (1949) for director Joseph Mankiewicz, beginning a long association with that studio.

Sam Goldwyn borrowed her for &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (1949), which earned her an Oscar nomination, then she went back to Fox for &quot;I&#x27;d Climb the Highest Mountain&quot; (1951), which was a hit.

She stayed at that studio to make the western &quot;Rawhide&quot; (1951) with Tyrone Power, and the romantic drama &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot; (1951).

Hayward then starred in three massive successes: &quot;David and Bathsheba&quot; (1951) with Gregory Peck, the most popular film of the year; &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot; (1952), a biopic of Jane Froman, which earned her an Oscar nomination; and &quot;The Snows of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1952), with Peck and Ava Gardner.

RKO borrowed Hayward for &quot;The Lusty Men&quot; (1952) with Robert Mitchum, then she went back to Fox for &quot;The President&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1953), playing Rachel Jackson alongside Charlton Heston; &quot;White Witch Doctor&quot; (1953) again a co-star with Mitchum; &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot; (1954), as Messalina; &quot;Garden of Evil&quot; (1954) with Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark; and &quot;Untamed&quot; (1955) with Tyrone Power. Hayward then starred with Clark Gable in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; (1955), a CinemaScope film that was a box office miss.

===Peak===
MGM hired Hayward to play the alcoholic showgirl/actress Lillian Roth in &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot; (1955), based on Roth&#x27;s best-selling autobiography of the same title, for which she received a Cannes award. It was a major financial success.

Although Hayward never truly became known as a singer—she disliked her own singing–she portrayed singers in several films. However, in &quot;I&#x27;ll Cry Tomorrow&quot;—whose vocals were once widely attributed to professional ghost singer Marni Nixon—Hayward sang the vocals undubbed and appears on the soundtrack. Hayward performed in the musical biography of singer Jane Froman in the 1952 film, &quot;With a Song in My Heart&quot;, a role which won her the Golden Globe for Best Actress Actress In A Leading Role – Musical Or Comedy. Jane Froman&#x27;s voice was recorded and used for the film as Hayward acted out the songs.
In 1956, she was cast by Howard Hughes to play Bortai in the historical epic &quot;The Conqueror&quot;, as John Wayne&#x27;s leading lady. It was critically deprecated but a commercial success. She did a comedy with Kirk Douglas, &quot;Top Secret Affair&quot; (1956) which flopped.

Hayward&#x27;s last film with Wanger, &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; (1958), in which she played death row inmate Barbara Graham, was a critical and commercial success and won Hayward the Academy Award for Best Actress for her portrayal. Many movie pundits have referred to her performance in &quot;I Want to Live!&quot; as the greatest Hollywood acting performance by any actress at any time. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that her performance was &quot;so vivid and so shattering ... Anyone who could sit through this ordeal without shivering and shuddering is made of stone.&quot; Hayward received 37% of the film&#x27;s net profits.
===Decline as star===
Hayward made &quot;Thunder in the Sun&quot; (1959) with Jeff Chandler, a wagon train picture about French Basque pioneers, which was a modest success financially, and then &quot;Woman Obsessed&quot; (1959) at Fox.

In 1961, Hayward starred as a shrewd working girl who becomes the wife of the state&#x27;s next governor (Dean Martin) and ultimately takes over the office herself in &quot;Ada&quot;. The same year, she played Rae Smith in Ross Hunter&#x27;s lavish remake of &quot;Back Street&quot;, which also starred John Gavin and Vera Miles. Neither film was particularly successful; nor were &quot;I Thank a Fool&quot; (1962) at MGM, &quot;Stolen Hours&quot; (1963), and &quot;Where Love Has Gone&quot; (1964), which co-starred Bette Davis.

===Later career===
Hayward was reunited with Joseph Mankiewicz in &quot;The Honey Pot&quot; (1967). Then she replaced Judy Garland as Helen Lawson in the film adaptation of Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; (1967), which drew terrible reviews but made money at the box office.

She received good reviews for her performance at Caesars Palace in the Las Vegas production of &quot;Mame&quot; that opened in December 1968. She was replaced by Celeste Holm in March 1969 after her voice gave out and she had to leave the production.

She continued to act into the early 1970s, when she was diagnosed with brain cancer.

She appeared in the TV movie &quot;Heat of Anger&quot; (1972) and the western film &quot;The Revengers&quot; (1972) with William Holden.

Her final film role was as Dr. Maggie Cole in the 1972 made-for-TV drama &quot;Say Goodbye, Maggie Cole&quot;. Intended to be the pilot episode for a television series, &quot;Maggie Cole&quot; was never produced because of Hayward&#x27;s failing health. Her last public appearance was at the Academy Awards telecast in 1974 to present the Best Actress award despite being very ill. With Charlton Heston&#x27;s support, she was able to present the award.

==Personal life==

During World War II, Hayward supported the war effort by volunteering at the Hollywood Canteen, where she met her first husband, actor Jess Barker. They married on July 23, 1944, and on February 19, 1945, fraternal twin sons named Gregory and Timothy were born. The marriage was turbulent, with a judge granting an interlocutory divorce decree on August 17, 1954. During the contentious divorce proceedings, Hayward stayed in the United States rather than join the Hong Kong location shoot for the film &quot;Soldier of Fortune.&quot; She shot her scenes on a sound stage with co-star Clark Gable in Hollywood. A few brief, distant scenes of Gable and a Hayward double walking near landmarks in Hong Kong were combined with the indoor shots. By April 1955, the stress of divorce proceedings and overwork prompted Hayward to attempt suicide by overdosing on sleeping pills. After taking the pills, she quickly regretted her decision and, in a panic, called her mother, who sent for the police; they had to break down the back door to reach her. Several months later, Hayward got into a violent fight with actress Jil Jarmyn after the latter found Hayward with her boyfriend, Donald Barry in his bedroom. When confronted about the fight, Hayward replied, &quot;I&#x27;m red-haired and Irish, you know, and I don&#x27;t let anybody call me names.&quot;

In 1957, Hayward married Floyd Eaton Chalkley, commonly known as Eaton Chalkley, a successful Georgia rancher and businessman who had worked as a federal agent. The marriage was a happy one. They lived on a farm near Carrollton, Georgia, and owned property across the state line in Cleburne County, just outside Heflin, Alabama. She became a popular figure in the area in the late 1950s. Chalkley died on January 9, 1966. Hayward went into mourning and did little acting for several years. She took up residence in Florida, because she preferred not to live in her Georgia home without her husband. On June 30, 1966, she was baptized Catholic by Father Daniel J. McGuire at SS. Peter and Paul&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh. Hayward had met McGuire, an acquaintance of Chalkley, in Rome eight years prior.

Before her Catholic baptism, Hayward had been a proponent of astrology. She particularly relied on the advice of Carroll Righter, who called himself &quot;the Gregarious Aquarius&quot; and the self-proclaimed &quot;Astrologer to the Stars&quot;, who informed her that the optimal time to sign a film contract was exactly 2:47 a.m., prompting her to set her alarm for 2:45 so she could be sure to follow his instructions.

==Death==

Hayward&#x27;s doctor found a lung tumor in March 1972 that metastasized and, after a seizure in April 1973, she was diagnosed with brain metastasis. On March 14, 1975, she suffered a seizure in her Beverly Hills home and died at the age of 57. A funeral service was held on March 16 at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Roman Catholic Church in Carrollton, Georgia. Hayward&#x27;s body was buried in the church&#x27;s cemetery.

Theories about the radioactive fallout from atmospheric atomic bomb tests surround the making of &quot;The Conqueror&quot; in St. George, Utah. Several production members, including Hayward, John Wayne, Agnes Moorehead, Pedro Armendáriz (who died by suicide after a diagnosis of cancer), and director Dick Powell later succumbed to cancer and cancer-related illnesses. As ascertained by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1980, out of a cast and crew totaling 220 people, 91 of them developed some form of cancer, and 46 had died of the disease.

While Hayward was a two pack a day smoker, and smoking was considered the main cause of lung cancer , the question is still open as to whether high residual radiation levels after the above ground nuclear explosions in Yucca Flat, only 137 miles from the set of The Conqueror, led directly to her relatively early death.

Susan Hayward has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6251 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Smash-Up, the Story of a Woman, also called A Woman Destroyed, is a 1947 American drama film with elements of film noir that tells the story of a rising nightclub singer who marries another singer and becomes an alcoholic after sacrificing her career for him.

The film starred Susan Hayward, Lee Bowman, Eddie Albert and Marsha Hunt. The screenplay was written by John Howard Lawson based on a story written by Dorothy Parker, Frank Cavett and Lionel Wiggam. Produced by Walter Wanger under his personal contract with Hayward, the film was directed by Stuart Heisler. Ethel Wales appears in an uncredited part.

The film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Hayward) and Best Writing, Original Story.

Because the film contains a story similar to that of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, it was rumored to be a cryptic biography of Bing Crosby and his stormy first marriage to Dixie Lee. A scene that has been popular with critics and fans is the violent slapping and hair-pulling fight between rivals Hayward and Hunt in the ladies‘ powder room (a scene repeated by Hayward 20 years later in &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;).

This film is in the public domain.

==Plot==
In a hospital, nightclub singer Angie Evans, her face bandaged, recounts the events that brought her there.

Angie becomes involved with aspiring singer Ken Conway. Her agent Mike Dawson helps Ken and piano accompanist Steve Anderson secure a spot on a radio show singing cowboy songs. Ken sings a ballad on the day that Angie, now his wife, gives birth to their daughter. Ken&#x27;s performance earns him a new career opportunity.

Ken soon achieves great success, gaining popularity and wealth, while Angie stays home. With her career at a standstill, she begins to drink. Ken counts on her to present a sophisticated image for his new high-society friends and contacts, but her alcoholism worsens, so secretary Martha Gray comes to Ken&#x27;s aid.

Angie is certain that Ken and Martha are having an affair. Steve tries to intervene on Angie&#x27;s behalf, but he can see that Martha has fallen in love with Ken.

Angie neglects her child, continues to drink, and then creates a scene at a party. Ken asks for a divorce and custody. Mike helps Angie find work in a club. She is determined to stay sober in order to regain custody of her daughter. Instead, she finds herself in a bar and wakes the next morning in the apartment of strangers who had found her unconscious on their stairs.

Angie kidnaps her daughter from the park and takes her to a house in the country where Angie dutifully gives the child dinner and puts her to bed. After she sings her daughter to sleep, Angie forgets a lit cigarette in the room. She begins to drink and indulges in memories before the child&#x27;s shouts finally alert her to the fire. Angie rescues her daughter from the flames but suffers serious facial burns.

Realizing that she has hit rock bottom, Angie is positive that she can move forward happily. Ken has talked with her doctor and wishes to try to support her.

==Production==
This was Hayward&#x27;s first major role, and made her a star, earning her the first of five Academy Award nominations.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;This irony of life might make for drama of a genuinely touching sort, as it did in that memorable picture of success and drunkenness, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. But, actually, in the writing, this complex tension has been so weakly drawn that the reason for the lady&#x27;s dipsomania seems completely arbitrary and contrived. Furthermore, the writer, John Howard Lawson, has so muddled the lady with motherless love that the story becomes a wallow less in liquor than in mawkish sentiment.&quot;

According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned $2 million in U.S. box office receipts in 1947.

The film lost $111,664 in its initial release.

<text>Erika Slezak (; born August 5, 1946) is an American actress, best known for her role as Victoria &quot;Viki&quot; Lord on the American daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1971 through the television finale in 2012 and again in the online revival in 2013. She is one of the longest-serving serial actors in American media. For her portrayal of Viki, she has won six Daytime Emmy Awards, the most of any daytime drama actress.

==Life and career==
Slezak was born in Hollywood, California, of Czech, Austrian, German-Jewish and Dutch descent, the daughter of Tony Award-winning Austrian actor Walter Slezak and Johanna &quot;Kaasi&quot; Van Rijn, and the granddaughter of opera tenor Leo Slezak. Her godmother was Alma Mahler-Werfel. She was born two months after her grandfather died. Raised in Greenwich, Connecticut, Slezak attended high school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Eden Hall in Torresdale, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At age 17, she became one of the youngest individuals ever accepted into London&#x27;s prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, later graduating in 1966. Establishing a noteworthy reputation in theater, she performed in Milwaukee, Chicago and Houston.

===&quot;One Life to Live&quot;===

In 1971, Slezak auditioned for the role of nurse Mary Kennecott on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. She was not cast on that show, but the network offered her the role of Victoria &quot;Viki&quot; Lord Riley on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (&quot;OLTL&quot;). In her 42 years in the role, Slezak won six Daytime Emmy Awards, which is an Emmy record for a female performer.

In 2007, Slezak voiced strong criticism of &quot;OLTL&quot; then-head writer, Dena Higley. In the March 2007 edition of Slezak&#x27;s fan club newsletter, she stated, &quot;Dena doesn&#x27;t care about the rich history of the show, which is evident in what she writes&quot; and that Higley &quot;wants to write stories that she thinks are interesting but nobody else does.&quot; Ron Carlivati was subsequently made co-head writer, with Higley ultimately leaving the series in September 2007.

In April 2011, ABC announced that &quot;OLTL&quot; would be cancelled, with its final airdate in January 2012. However, media company Prospect Park licensed the creative rights to the show from ABC in July 2011 and announced that they would migrate the series to an online format. In September 2011, Slezak confirmed she would be participating in the new version show, along with other regular cast members. The Prospect Park project stalled in November 2011, and &quot;OLTL&quot; ended its run on ABC as scheduled. In early 2013, Prospect Park announced it was moving forward with their online versions of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot;, with Slezak confirmed on board. The revived series, taped in Stamford, Connecticut, premiered on Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes on April 29, 2013, and ran through August 19, 2013.

===Other projects===
Slezak portrayed Jean Roberts in the 1996 television film adaptation of Danielle Steel&#x27;s novel &quot;Full Circle&quot;.

In April 2018, Slezak appeared as Dr. Eileen Jacoby on the Fox series &quot;The Resident&quot;, in the episode &quot;Haunted&quot;. In 2019, she starred alongside Jeff Daniels in the drama film &quot;Guest Artist&quot;, based on the actor&#x27;s 2006 play of the same name. Later that year, she guest-starred in the CBS police drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;. She returned to series in 2022.

In 2019, Slezak was interviewed for an episode of the ABC news program &quot;20/20&quot; which focused on the murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer. Schaeffer had a recurring role on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in the mid-1980s.

==Personal life==
Slezak is married to Brian Davies, and is the mother of two children, Michael and Amanda. In 2003, Amanda Davies played a teenaged version of her mother&#x27;s character Victoria in flashback scenes on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. Amanda Davies died on January 29, 2024.

==Awards==
Slezak has won six Daytime Emmy Awards in the category of &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series&quot; out of nine nominations for her role as Victoria. Nominated in 1983, 1988, and 2012, she won in 1984, 1986, 1992, 1995, 1996 and 2005, making the record for most wins by an actress and, along with Justin Deas, is second to 8-time winner Anthony Geary, for the most wins for playing one character. Additionally, Slezak won the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Award for Favorite Couple with Mark Derwin in 2000.

<doc id="183814" wikidata="Q155116" url="?curid=183814" title="Dorothy McGuire">
<text>Dorothy Hackett McGuire (June 14, 1916 – September 13, 2001) was an American actress. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947) and won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress for &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956). She starred as the mother in the popular films &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957) and &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960).

==Life and career==
===Early years===
McGuire was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the only child of Isabelle Flaherty McGuire and Thomas Johnson McGuire. She made her stage debut at age 13 at the local community playhouse in Barrie&#x27;s &quot;A Kiss for Cinderella&quot;. Her co-star was Henry Fonda, who was also born in Nebraska and was making a return visit to his home town after becoming a success on Broadway.

After her father&#x27;s death, McGuire attended a convent school in Indianapolis, Indiana. She later attended Pine Manor Junior College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, serving as president of that school&#x27;s drama club. She graduated from Pine Manor when she was 19.

===Theatre and Modeling===
McGuire was one of the most sought after models under Walter Thornton&#x27;s management. She appeared in summer stock at Deertrees, Maine, in 1937 before going to New York.

McGuire acted on radio, playing Sue in the serial &quot;Big Sister&quot; (1937) and took part in an experimental television broadcast, &quot;The Mysterious Mummy Case&quot; (1938). She was hired by producer Jed Harris to understudy the ingenue in a Broadway play, &quot;Stop Over&quot; (1938), which ran only 23 performances. McGuire was an understudy to Martha Scott in &quot;Our Town&quot; in 1938, eventually taking over Scott&#x27;s role.

McGuire toured in &quot;My Dear Children&quot; opposite John Barrymore, and in 1939, was in a revue with Benny Goodman, &quot;Swingin&#x27; the Dream&quot;. She had a role in the short-lived &quot;Medicine Show&quot; (1940), and a part in the longer-running revival of &quot;Kind Lady&quot; (1940).

McGuire gained attention on Broadway when cast in the title role of the domestic comedy &quot;Claudia&quot;. It ran for 722 performances from 1941 to 1943. Brooks Atkinson wrote: &quot;She gives a splendid performance of a part that would be irritating if it were played by a dull actress. She is personally genuine; the charm she radiates across the play is not merely theatrical mannerism.&quot;

===Film===

Brought to Hollywood by producer David O. Selznick (who called her &quot;a born actress&quot;) on the strength of her stage performance, McGuire starred in her first film, &quot;Claudia&quot; (1943), a movie adaptation of her Broadway success. She portrayed a child bride who almost destroys her marriage through her selfishness. Selznick developed the project, which co-starred Robert Young, then sold it to 20th Century Fox; under this deal, Selznick would share McGuire&#x27;s contract with Fox.

RKO reunited McGuire with Young in &quot;The Enchanted Cottage&quot; (1945), which was a box-office success.

At age 28, she played the mother in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945), replacing Gene Tierney, who had become pregnant. Under the direction of Elia Kazan at 20th Century Fox, the film was a big success. So, too, was &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; (1946) in which McGuire played the lead role, a mute. It was originally prepared by Selznick, who envisioned Ingrid Bergman in the lead; Selznick sold the project to RKO along with the services for his producer Dore Schary.

McGuire and Young made a third film together, &quot;Claudia and David&quot; (1946), a sequel to &quot;Claudia&quot;, which was less well received. Schary and RKO put her in &quot;Till the End of Time&quot; (also 1946), a hit with audiences. She later said: &quot;I fought the hardest for this role and it was my least successful. I went right back to playing nice girls and faithful wives. &quot;

She was offered the lead in &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; (1946), but turned it down to go travelling with her family.

McGuire was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947) directed by Kazan for Fox. The film was a surprise hit.

Following this film, McGuire, co-star Gregory Peck, and some other actors helped form the La Jolla Playhouse. She appeared in productions of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;, and &quot;Tonight at 8:30&quot;, then went to live in Italy for a year.
Selznick announced a variety of films to star McGuire that were not made, including &quot;Dark Medallion&quot;, &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; &quot;Wings of the Dove&quot; and &quot;Sands of Time&quot;.

===Radio===
McGuire was a member of the cast of &quot;Big Sister&quot; (playing Sue Evans), and &quot;Joyce Jordan, M.D.&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;This Is My Best&quot; (&quot;Miracle in the Rain&quot;), &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot; (&quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot;) and in &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; (&quot;Hamlet&quot; &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, &quot;Our Town&quot;).

===Later films===
McGuire spent some time away from screens before returning in two movies for Fox, &quot;Mother Didn&#x27;t Tell Me&quot; (1950) and &quot;Mister 880&quot; (1950). Neither was particularly popular.

She made her TV debut in &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;Dark Victory&quot;, with McGuire playing the Bette Davis role. Schary had become head of production at MGM, where McGuire appeared in &quot;Callaway Went Thataway&quot; (1951), which lost money. She did &quot;I Want You&quot; (1951) for Sam Goldwyn, then returned to Broadway for &quot;Legend of Lovers&quot; (1951–52), but it only had a short run.

McGuire made &quot;Invitation&quot; (1952) at MGM, which flopped, and &quot;Make Haste to Live&quot; (1954) at Republic. She had a huge hit with &quot;Three Coins in the Fountain&quot; (1954) at Fox, and appeared in episodes of &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;, &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot; (an adaptation of &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;, as Tracey Lord), and &quot;Climax!&quot;.

At MGM, she was in &quot;Trial&quot; (1955), playing Glenn Ford&#x27;s love interest. The movie was a hit.

===Mother roles===
McGuire was cast as Gary Cooper&#x27;s wife in &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956), directed by William Wyler. The success of this performance led her to being cast in a series of &quot;mother&quot; roles, continuing with &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957) at Disney.

McGuire returned to Broadway in &quot;Winesburg, Ohio&quot; (1958), which had a short run, then she played a wife and mother in &quot;The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker&quot; (1959) at Fox.

She played the matriarch in some melodramas: &quot;This Earth Is Mine&quot; (1959) with Jean Simmons at Universal; &quot;A Summer Place&quot; (1959) for Delmer Daves with Richard Egan, Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue at Warner Bros., a big success; and &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1960).

She returned to Disney with &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960), one of the most popular films of the year. She made a second film with Daves and Donahue, &quot;Susan Slade&quot; (1961), playing a mother who passed off her daughter&#x27;s illegitimate child as her own. She was a mother in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Summer Magic&quot; (1963).

McGuire played the Virgin Mary in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965). She was off screen for a number of years before returning in a British family film, &quot;Flight of the Doves&quot; (1971).

===Television===
McGuire appeared in some TV movies, &quot;She Waits&quot; (1972) and a PBS adaptation of &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; (1972). She provided voice work for &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; (1973), and made one final appearance on Broadway in a revival of &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1976–77) alongside Richard Chamberlain.

Most of McGuire&#x27;s later career work was for the small screen: &quot;The Runaways&quot; (1975), &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; (1976), the pilot for &quot;Little Women&quot; (1976), &quot;The Incredible Journey of Doctor Meg Laurel&quot; (1979), &quot;Ghost Dancing&quot; (1983), &quot;Amos&quot; (1985), &quot;Between the Darkness and the Dawn&quot; (1985), &quot;American Geisha&quot; (1986), &quot;Caroline?&quot; (1990), and &quot;The Last Best Year&quot; (1990).

She was also in episodes of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Glitter&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, and &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;. She provided the narration for &quot;Summer Heat&quot; (1987), and toured in 1987 in &quot;I Never Sang for My Father&quot;.
In 1984–85, McGuire played Cora Miller on the long-running CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Cora was the estranged mother of tycoon Victor Newman, played by Eric Braeden

In 1982, she said, &quot;I love my career, but I never felt much about it – about how to nurture it...It&#x27;s been very erratic, after all ... To this day, I don&#x27;t know what shapes a Hollywood career ... I was never a classic beauty. I had no image, so I found myself in a lot of things accidentally.&quot;

McGuire retired from acting after suffering a hip injury in the early 1990s. 

==Personal life and death==
McGuire was married to &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer John Swope for more than 35 years, with whom she had a son, photographer Mark Swope (1953–2016), and a daughter, actress Topo Swope (b. 1949).

McGuire died in Santa Monica, California, on September 13, 2001, at the age of 85; she developed arrhythmia weeks after sustaining a broken leg.

==Recognition==
For her contribution to the motion-picture industry, Dorothy McGuire has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard. It was dedicated February 8, 1960.

<text>I Remember Mama is a 1948 American drama film directed by George Stevens from a screenplay by DeWitt Bodeen, whose work was adapted from John Van Druten&#x27;s stage play. Druten, in turn, had based his play on Kathryn Forbes&#x27; novel &quot;Mama&#x27;s Bank Account&quot;, which was originally published by Harcourt Brace in 1943. The story in all its variant forms recounts the everyday life and economic struggles of a Norwegian immigrant family in San Francisco in the early 20th century. The film stars Irene Dunne as the mother, as well as Barbara Bel Geddes, Oscar Homolka, Ellen Corby and Philip Dorn. Homolka portrays Uncle Chris in the film, a role he had performed earlier in the Broadway production.

The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including best actor and actress in a supporting role, with Irene Dunne receiving her final Best Actress nomination.

==Plot==
The film begins with eldest daughter Katrin completing the last lines of her autobiographical novel. As she reminisces about her family life, there is a flashback to 1910, where the first of a series of vignettes finds Marta Hanson preparing the weekly budget with her husband Lars, daughters Katrin, Christine and Dagmar, and son Nels, who announces his desire to attend high school. Each family member makes a financial sacrifice to contribute to the boy&#x27;s education.

Marta&#x27;s sister Trina arrives, announces she is marrying undertaker Peter Thorkelson, and implores Marta to break the news to their sisters Sigrid and Jenny. When Marta threatens to reveal embarrassing anecdotes about them, the women accept their sister&#x27;s decision.

When Jonathan Hyde, the Hansons&#x27; impoverished lodger, reads &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; aloud for the family, they are deeply moved by the story. Later, the family is visited by Marta&#x27;s gruff but soft-hearted Uncle Chris and his housekeeper Jessie Brown, who is secretly his wife. When Chris discovers Dagmar is ill with mastoiditis, he insists on taking her to the hospital. Dagmar&#x27;s operation is a success, but Marta is prohibited from seeing her. Disguised as a member of the housekeeping staff, she sneaks into Dagmar&#x27;s ward and softly sings to her.

When Dagmar returns home, she learns her cat, Uncle Elizabeth, had been mauled and seriously injured during its outside wanderings. Despite Dagmar&#x27;s belief in her mother&#x27;s healing powers, Marta feels helpless to save the cat and sends Nels to buy chloroform so she can euthanize it. The following morning, she is astonished when Dagmar walks in with an apparently cured cat. Instead of killing the cat, the dose of chloroform that Marta had administered only provided the cat with the deep sleep it needed to aid its recovery.

Mr. Hyde suddenly and quietly moves out, leaving his classic books and a check for his accumulated months of rent. The family&#x27;s initial joy of receiving the large rent payment quickly vanishes once they discover that the check has no value. Sigrid and Jenny are furious; but as Marta tears up the worthless piece of paper, she declares that Hyde&#x27;s gift of literature is far more valuable than the money itself.

Katrin brags to Christine that their mother is going to buy her the dresser set she has long admired as a graduation present. As she is about to leave to perform in the school&#x27;s production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, Katrin learns (from a resentful Christine) that her mother traded her heirloom brooch for the gift. Distraught, Katrin performs badly in the play and later retrieves the brooch after trading back the dresser set. Marta then gives the brooch to Katrin as a graduation present. Katrin&#x27;s father presents her with her first cup of coffee, which she had been told she could drink once she was a grown-up. After taking a few sips of the &quot;adult&quot; beverage, Katrin is overcome with emotion by her parents&#x27; gesture, and she rushes out of the room.

Marta learns Uncle Chris is near death, and she takes Katrin to say goodbye. He reveals he has no money to leave his niece because he has been donating his income to help children with leg or foot problems walk again. He also reveals he is married to his housekeeper Jessie. After enjoying a final drink with his niece and Jessie, Uncle Chris dies peacefully in bed.

Trina marries Peter Thorkelson in the Hanson&#x27;s parlor. One year later, they are seen on a park bench with their baby in a baby carriage.

Katrin is dejected when she receives her tenth literary rejection letter. Marta then takes some of her stories to famed author and gourmand Florence Dana Moorhead and convinces her to read them. Marta returns home and advises her daughter that Moorhead feels the girl should write about what she knows best. Marta urges Katrin to write about Papa. When Katrin&#x27;s story is accepted for publication, she is paid $500 (). After announcing some of the money will go towards the purchase of the winter coat Marta wants, Katrin confesses her story is titled &quot;Mama and the Hospital&quot;. She begins to read it to her family, and the story&#x27;s introduction concludes and the film itself ends with the line &quot;But first and foremost, I remember Mama&quot;.

==Production==
Stevens originally offered the role of Mama to Greta Garbo, but she had retired from films six years before and declined the role. He then cast Irene Dunne, whom he had directed in &quot;Penny Serenade&quot; in 1941. Although she was 50 years old, the actress had a youthful appearance and had to be aged with makeup to portray the family matriarch convincingly. Oscar Homolka was the only member of the original Broadway cast to reprise his role for the film.

Some scenes were filmed on Rhode Island Street, on San Francisco&#x27;s Potrero Hill, Nob Hill, Telegraph Hill, Russian Hill, Eureka Valley, and Market Street.

==Release==
The film premiered as the Easter attraction at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

===Critical reception===
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther said the film &quot;should prove irresistible&quot; and added, &quot;Irene Dunne does a beautiful job ... handling with equal facility an accent and a troubled look, [she] has the strength and vitality, yet the softness, that the role requires.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; calls it &quot;a delicate charmer, sometimes precious, but nonetheless fine&quot; and &quot;meticulously directed.&quot;

The London-based magazine &quot;Time Out&quot; describes it as &quot;a charmer . . . directed and acted with real delicacy.&quot;

It was named one of the year&#x27;s Ten Best by &quot;Film Daily&quot;.

===Box office===
Despite receiving good reviews, it failed to turn a profit due to its high production costs. It recorded a loss of $1,040,000.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and it was the second of four films to date, following &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; (1936) and preceding &quot;Othello&quot; (1965) and &quot;Doubt&quot; (2008) to receive four acting nominations without being nominated for Best Picture.

The cast received a Protestant Motion Picture Council Award, which was collected by Dunne in 1949.

==Additional adaptations==
&quot;Mama&quot;, a CBS television series starring Peggy Wood, ran from 1949 to 1957. The popularity and high ratings of the series prompted a national re-release of &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; in 1956.

After the success of the film version of &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;, Dunne, Homolka and Bel Geddes reprised their roles in a one-hour radio broadcast of the story on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; on August 30, 1948.

There was also a British Independent Television production of &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; in 1961.

I Dismember Mama is a 1972 horror film which bears no relation to I Remember Mama, apart from the pun of its title.

A musical stage adaptation, starring Liv Ullmann and George Hearn, had a three-month run in the Majestic Theatre on Broadway in 1979.

<doc id="183824" wikidata="Q333268" url="?curid=183824" title="Sonic boom">
<text>A sonic boom is a sound associated with shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound. Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding similar to an explosion or a thunderclap to the human ear.

The crack of a supersonic bullet passing overhead or the crack of a bullwhip are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.

Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. This led to the prohibition of routine supersonic flight overland. Although sonic booms cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle, the nuisance due to sonic booms may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a feasible option.

A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the sound barrier and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the supersonic object. Rather, the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is traveling at supersonic speeds and affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over observers, they will briefly experience the &quot;boom&quot;.

==Causes==
When an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of pressure waves in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the bow and stern waves created by a boat. These waves travel at the speed of sound and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other&#x27;s way quickly enough. Eventually, they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as &quot;Mach 1&quot;, which is approximately at sea level and .

In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail. Because the different radial directions around the aircraft&#x27;s direction of travel are equivalent (given the &quot;smooth flight&quot; condition), the shock wave forms a Mach cone, similar to a vapour cone, with the aircraft at its tip. The half-angle formula_1 between the direction of flight and the shock wave is given by:

:formula_2,

where formula_3 is the inverse formula_4 of the plane&#x27;s Mach number formula_5. Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.

There is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This &quot;overpressure profile&quot; is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The &quot;boom&quot; is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms – one when the initial pressure rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive &quot;double boom&quot; from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.

Since the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft&#x27;s flight path, a bit like an unrolling red carpet, and hence known as the &quot;boom carpet&quot;. Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle formula_6.

For today&#x27;s supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 Pa (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak overpressures for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an F-4 flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of . In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage—shattered glass, for example—will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from the sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and other agencies.

The power, or volume, of the shock wave, depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets &quot;tighter&quot; around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes, no boom is heard. The &quot;length&quot; of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore &quot;spread out&quot; their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.

Several smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in supersonic flow.

The later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster, and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the &quot;rise time&quot; of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about , meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be &quot;softer&quot;. However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.

== Supersonic aircraft == 
Supersonic aircraft are any aircraft that can achieve flight faster than Mach 1, which refers to the speed of sound. &quot;Supersonic includes speeds up to five times Mach than the speed of sound, or Mach 5.&quot; (Dunbar, 2015) The top mileage per hour for a supersonic aircraft normally ranges from . Typically, most aircraft do not exceed . There are many variations of supersonic aircraft. Some models of supersonic aircraft make use of better-engineered aerodynamics that allow a few sacrifices in the aerodynamics of the model for thruster power. Other models use the efficiency and power of the thruster to allow a less aerodynamic model to achieve greater speeds. A typical model found in United States military use ranges from an average of $13 million to $35 million U.S. dollars.

==Measurement and examples==
The pressure from sonic booms caused by aircraft is often a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.

==Abatement==
In the late 1950s when supersonic transport (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the North American XB-70 &quot;Valkyrie&quot; first flew, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000 m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.

Richard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at Cornell University studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a &quot;figure of merit&quot; (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft&#x27;s weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for Concorde and 1.9 for the Boeing 2707. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment, mixed with politics, eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft less useful (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Small airplane designs like business jets are favored and tend to produce minimal to no audible booms.

Building on the earlier research of L. B. Jones, Seebass, and George identified conditions in which sonic boom shockwaves could be eliminated. This work was extended by Christine. M. Darden and described as the &quot;Jones-Seebass-George-Darden theory of sonic boom minimization&quot;. This theory, approached the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused (SR-71 Blackbird, Boeing X-43) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nose cone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed (bow shock), and using a swept back flying wing or an oblique flying wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule. Ideally, this would raise the characteristic altitude from to 60,000 feet (from 12,000 m to 18,000 m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.
This remained untested for decades, until DARPA started the Quiet Supersonic Platform project and funded the Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an F-5 Freedom Fighter. The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model. The fairing extended from the nose back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft. The SSBD was tested over two years culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a chase plane, the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde&#x27;s boom to an acceptable level below FM = 1.

As a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a NASA-Gulfstream Aerospace team tested the Quiet Spike on NASA Dryden&#x27;s F-15B aircraft 836. The Quiet Spike is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed. Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA&#x27;s Intelligent Flight Control System testbed, aircraft 837.

Some theoretical designs do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the Busemann biplane. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if it generates aerodynamic lift.

In 2018, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a $247.5 million contract to construct a design known as the Low Boom Flight Demonstrator, which aims to reduce the boom to the sound of a car door closing. As of October 2023, the first flight was expected in 2024.

==Perception, noise, and other concerns==

The sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double &quot;boom&quot; as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of mortar bombs, commonly used in firework displays. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, &quot;You don&#x27;t actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the airplane – it indicates the instruments. And that&#x27;s what we see around Mach 1. But we don&#x27;t hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That&#x27;s rather like the wake of a ship – it&#x27;s behind us.&quot;

In 1964, NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration began the Oklahoma City sonic boom tests, which caused eight sonic booms per day over six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a class-action lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.

Sonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases, the &quot;torching&quot; (masonry mortar underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.

There has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA&#x27;s Quiet Supersonic Platform studies. Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content. Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom &quot;N&quot; wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground. Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long. A new metric has emerged, known as &quot;perceived&quot; loudness, measured in PLdB. This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc. A well-known example is the snapping of one&#x27;s fingers in which the &quot;perceived&quot; sound is nothing more than an annoyance.

The energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1–100 hertz frequency range that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, gunfire and most industrial noise. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depend on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft&#x27;s altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom&#x27;s lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track. Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately for each of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at will create a lateral boom spread of about . For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration, or turning, can cause the focus of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances, weather conditions can distort sonic booms.

Depending on the aircraft&#x27;s altitude, sonic booms reach the ground 2 to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when the sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 °C), the temperature at drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (−45 °C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft&#x27;s speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at is about , but an aircraft must travel at least (Mach 1.12) for a boom to be heard on the ground.

The composition of the atmosphere is also a factor. Temperature variations, humidity, atmospheric pollution, and winds can all affect how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground. Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom. Hard surfaces such as concrete, pavement, and large buildings can cause reflections that may amplify the sound of a sonic boom. Conversely, grassy fields and profuse foliage can help attenuate the strength of the overpressure of a sonic boom.

Currently, there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.

==Bullwhip==

The cracking sound of a bullwhip is a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the &quot;cracker&quot;, moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.

A bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the momentum is transferred down the length of the tapering whip, the declining mass being made up for with increasing speed. Goriely and McMillen showed that the physical explanation is complex, involving the way that a loop travels down a tapered filament under tension.

<text>James Addison Reavis (May 10, 1843November 27, 1914), later using the name James Addison Peralta-Reavis, the so-called Baron of Arizona, was an American forger and fraudster. He is best known in association with the Peralta land grant, also known as the Barony of Arizona, a pair of fraudulent land claims, which if certified, would have granted him ownership of over of land in central Arizona Territory and western New Mexico Territory. During the course of the fraud, Reavis collected an estimated US$5.3 million in cash and promissory notes ($ in present-day terms) through the sale of quitclaims and proposed investment plans.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase, the United States was required to recognize and honor existing land grants made by either the Spanish or Mexican governments. Reavis used this provision by manufacturing a fictional claim and then generating a collection of documents demonstrating how the claim came into his possession. The documents were then covertly inserted into various records archives. In his initial claim, Reavis claimed title to the grant via a series of conveyances. When serious challenges to this claim developed, Reavis developed a second claim by marrying the purported last surviving lineal descendant of the original claim recipient.

During the course of his deception, Reavis convinced prominent people to support his efforts. He obtained legal and political support from Roscoe Conkling, Robert G. Ingersoll, and James Broadhead. Business leaders such as Charles Crocker and John W. Mackay, in turn, provided financial support. Initial exposure of the fraud occurred when an unfavorable surveyor general report caused the claim to be summarily dismissed. In response to this action, Reavis sued the U.S. government for US$11 million in damages ($ in present-day terms). The suit, in turn, prompted the U.S. government to perform a detailed investigation that fully exposed the forgeries Reavis had planted in a variety of locations.

==Early life==
Reavis was born the second of five children to Fenton George Reavis and Mary Reavis (née Dixon) on May 10, 1843, in Henry County, Missouri, near the town of Clinton. His father was a Welshman who had emigrated to the United States in the early 1820s. His mother was of Scottish and Spanish descent and proud of her Spanish heritage. The family lived on a small farm and owned a small tannery. Reavis received little formal education, but his mother read Spanish Romantic literature to him, and he developed a grandiose and eloquent writing pattern. In 1857, the family sold their farm and moved to Montevallo, Missouri, where they opened a store.

Following the outbreak of the American Civil War, Reavis enlisted in Hunter&#x27;s Regiment of the Confederate Army, 8th Division of the Missouri State Guard. Several months later, he went to Springfield and re-enlisted in Captain Lowe&#x27;s company. Initially holding dreams of glory, the 18-year-old Reavis soon discovered the realities of military life did not match his romanticized ideals. About this time, he accidentally discovered that he could accurately reproduce his commanding officer&#x27;s signature. Using this new-found skill, Reavis began producing passes to avoid the drudgery of army life, and instead spent time visiting his mother. When his fellow soldiers noticed the frequency and manner by which he obtained his passes, Reavis began selling forged passes to them. When some of his superiors became suspicious of Reavis, he obtained leave supposedly to get married, but instead used it to surrender to Union forces. Following his surrender, Reavis joined the Union Army and briefly served in an artillery regiment.

Following the war, Reavis traveled to Brazil and learned Portuguese. He returned to St. Louis, Missouri, near the end of 1866. There, he worked a series of jobs, including streetcar conductor, traveling salesman, and clerk at a variety of retail stores. Eventually, he found success as a real-estate agent. After several small real-estate deals, Reavis saved enough money to open his own office. He then discovered that the skills he learned forging army passes allowed him to adjust real-estate paperwork and correct imperfect property titles. In one established instance, he aided in this manner a man seeking to purchase a tract of land near St. Louis. Three generations of documents accumulated by the selling family were unable to establish clear title for the land. Reavis was able to produce a yellowed and fading 18th-document that all previous searches had failed to notice. Accepted as valid by all parties to the transaction, this (forged) document allowed his client to complete the transaction.

==George Willing==
Reavis met George M. Willing Jr. in 1871. Willing was a physician-turned-prospector who supplemented his income selling patent medicine. He came to the real estate agent upon the recommendation of Colonel Byser, a previous customer of Reavis&#x27;s, seeking assistance with a real estate purchase. According to Willing, he had purchased the rights to a large Spanish land grant from Miguel Peralta for US$20,000 in gold dust, prospecting equipment, and saddle mules. The transaction had occurred at a simple mining site in Black Canyon, southeast of Prescott, Arizona Territory without the usual documentation. As Willing explained, &quot;When the trade was made, I had no paper on which to write the deed, so I scoured the camp and found a sheet of greasy, pencil-marked camp paper upon which I wrote ... and as there were no justices or notaries present I had it acknowledged before witnesses.&quot; The deed of transfer was dated October 20, 1864.
Willing reached Prescott in 1867 to record the transaction. He was short of funds at the time of his arrival, so offered to sell a half interest in the claim to the local stable owner, James D. Monihon. Willing suggested that the two of them could reap a sizable profit by selling nearby mines back to their owners. Monihon was incensed by the offer, and the local townsfolk were soon unfriendly to Willing. Fearing for his safety, Willing quickly settled his bills and left the next morning with a government surveying team destined for Santa Fe.

Reavis suggested Willing leave the documents to allow him time to inspect them. Willing declined the offer, and instead returned the next day with an expert in Spanish land titles, William W. Gitt. Recently returned to St. Louis, Gitt was known as the &quot;Old Spanish Land Title Lawyer&quot; following a series of dubious land deals in Illinois and Missouri. The previous two decades he had lived in Guadalajara, Mexico, after an 1847 land claim lawsuit had resulted in a bench warrant being issued in the lawyer&#x27;s name.

The three men began meeting for several hours each week to examine the grant paperwork. In addition to the deed between Willing and Peralta, they had an , a copy of the legal papers relating to the Peralta grant. Accompanying the copies was a letter dated 1853 and bearing the signature of Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna claiming a diligent search had been performed to locate all related documents and that the &quot;expediente&quot; established secure title of the grant. Reavis used this time and association with Gitt to learn about Mexican and Spanish land documents. He also developed a friendship with Willing&#x27;s wife, Mary Ann, whom the young real estate agent regarded as a second mother.

After a few years, Reavis and Willing formed a partnership aimed at promoting the claim. The two men planned to travel separately, allowing Willing to retain Reavis as a real-estate expert upon his arrival. Willing left with the paperwork in January 1874, taking the overland route to Arizona Territory. Reavis traveled by sea to California via Panama. In California, Reavis visited Florin Massol, a Sacramento merchant with whom Willing had left papers assigning mining rights within the Peralta grant as collateral against a loan.

Reavis married Ada Pope of Montevallo on May 5, 1874. The couple had known each other since the days when Reavis&#x27; family operated their store. Following a brief honeymoon, he departed for the west and the couple did not see each other again for over six years. Dissatisfied with the state of their marriage, she received a divorce on grounds of desertion in 1883.

==Establishing the grant==
Willing arrived in Prescott in March 1874 and filed his claim in the Yavapai County Courthouse. The next morning, he was found dead. No official investigation as to the cause of Willing&#x27;s death was ever performed. Suggested causes include poison, &quot;exposure and privation&quot;, or simply &quot;strange and unwitnessed circumstances&quot;. Reavis learned of his partner&#x27;s death upon his arrival in San Francisco. He had expected a bundle of correspondence awaiting his arrival, but instead found only two letters. The first, from Willing, announcing the doctor&#x27;s safe arrival in Prescott. The second, informing Reavis of Willing&#x27;s death, was from the Yavapai County sheriff who sent a letter to the only address in the doctor&#x27;s papers.

Reavis needed Willing&#x27;s papers to continue the scheme. In poor health from the journey and low on funds, Reavis worked as a schoolteacher in Downey, California, during 1875 and 1876. He then worked as a journalist in Northern California, serving as a correspondent for &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; and &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; with occasional work for a New York City paper. As a result of his journalism jobs, Reavis met railroad tycoons Collis Huntington and Charles Crocker. He was also able to observe the operation of the Public Land Commission. At the time the commission had approved over 500 of the 800 claims presented to it, and even frivolous claims were considered as long as examination expenses were paid by the filer, and bribery was a commonly accepted practice. Assuming practices in Arizona Territory were similar to those in California gave Reavis great hope for confirmation of the Peralta grant.

Reavis&#x27; first visit to Arizona Territory came with a May 1880 trip to Phoenix. Posing as a subscription agent for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, he toured the area and even made a trip out to the confluence of Salt and Gila Rivers. From Phoenix, Reavis took a stagecoach to Prescott. Upon his arrival in the territorial capital, he inquired into Dr. Willing&#x27;s death. After locating the probate judge who had overseen the case, Reavis presented a letter from Willing&#x27;s widow authorizing him to take custody of any papers that had been in Willing&#x27;s possession. A search by the probate judge located Willing&#x27;s possessions and gave Reavis control of the Peralta grant paperwork. After completing this business, Reavis returned to California.

Under Willing, the grant had been a &quot;floater&quot;, a grant for a certain amount of territory, but lacking a fixed location. Such grants, while common, were useful as legal nuisances capable of scaring an unsophisticated land owner, but of little real value. Reavis decided to change this and fixed the location of the grant. To deal with ambiguities regarding various historical measurements, he chose the definitions most advantageous to his goals. As a result, the grant for a 10 by 30-league area turned into a territory running north to south and east to west. The size later grew to With the center of its western boundary set near the confluence of the Salt and Gila Rivers, the grant contained the towns of Phoenix, Globe, Casa Grande, Florence, and Tempe and stretched to the outskirts of Silver City, New Mexico. Other points of interest within the grant boundaries were the Silver King Mine and a section of the Southern Pacific Railroad.

To achieve his vision, Reavis had to first clear some outstanding business issues and obtain additional documentation. His first step was a July 1881 visit to the family of Florin Massol, where he obtained a release of the mining rights that Willing had signed over, in exchange for a contract to pay US$3000 plus interest to Massol on the condition that the Peralta grant be confirmed. Additionally, Massol, using a power of attorney, signed over Willing&#x27;s interest in the grant to Reavis. Reavis then traveled to the East Coast. The record book for Mission San Xavier del Bac, which had been sent to Philadelphia for the Centennial Exposition, was at the time in Washington, DC, pending its return to Bishop Salpointe. While in Washington, Reavis obtained permission to examine the book in detail.

After examining the San Xavier record book, Reavis traveled to Mexico, where from September to November 1881, he searched the archives in Guadalajara and Mexico City for information related to the Peralta grant. In Mexico, he resumed the role of a newspaper correspondent looking for items of interest to Los Angeles and San Francisco readers. He also cultivated friendships with the archivists in both cities, relationships that enabled him to gain easy access to the materials he was interested in inspecting. By the time he left Mexico, Reavis had a collection of photographs and certified copies of papers related to the Peralta grant. Reavis then traveled to see Mary Ann Willing, who was then living in Kentucky. During his visit, on May 1, 1882, the widow signed over her interest in the grant for US$30,000 paid over time.

===First Baron of Arizona===
Contained within the collection of papers Reavis had collected was the story of the Peralta grant&#x27;s creation and the life history of the fictional first and second Barons of Arizona. The tale began with the birth of Don Miguel Nemecio Silva de Peralta de la Córdoba in 1708 to Don José Gaston Silva y Carrillo de Peralta de las Falces de Mendoza and Doña Francisca Maria de Garcia de la Córdoba y Muñiz de Perez. Don Miguel entered the King of Spain&#x27;s service in 1727 as a lieutenant of dragoons. He was appointed , a royal inspector, in 1742 and sent on a secret mission to Guadalajara in New Spain. Papers confirming Don Miguel&#x27;s appointment named him as Baron of Arizonaca, Knight of the Golden Fleece, and member of the Order of Montesa.

The exact nature of the royal emissary&#x27;s mission was never revealed, but may have involved leaked claims of silver being found in northern Sonora. Apparently pleased with the results, Philip V issued a royal (decree) stating the royal intention to make a land grant to Don Miguel in November 1744. Philip&#x27;s was not acted upon until December 20, 1748, when Ferdinand VI promoted Don Miguel to captain of dragoons, bestowed upon him the title Baron of the Colorados, and issued another instructing the Viceroy of New Spain to locate a suitable tract containing 300 square leagues of land.

A suitable tract of land was not located north of Mission San Xavier del Bac until January 3, 1758, and a decree was issued by the Viceroy, Agustín de Ahumada, granting Don Miguel the land. The ceremony to physically locate and mark the claim occurred in May 1758. Don Miguel traveled to the claim&#x27;s location accompanied by a priest from San Xavier and two officers from the viceroy&#x27;s garrison. The priest served as adjudicator, while the officers acted as witnesses and surveyors. During the ceremony, a large rock located on top of a hill, which they name the &quot;Inicial Monument&quot;, was spotted and chosen to mark the center of the property&#x27;s western boundary.

Following the expulsion of the Jesuits from New Spain in 1768, Don Miguel sent a request to Charles III for reconfirmation of his grant. The request was granted in 1776, an unusually long delay even accounting for bureaucratic processing and travel times of the day, in the form of a letter reading &quot;I, the King of Spain, gratefully acknowledge your many valuable services in the army of the crown, and approve the grant to you which you have above described.&quot;

Don Miguel made one attempt to settle on his land, using the ruins at Casa Grande as his base of operation. The attempt was unsuccessful due to persistent raids from Apache. After the failed attempt, Don Miguel returned to Mexico, where in November 1770, he married Sofia Ave Maria Sanchez Bonilla de Amaya y Garcia de Orosco at Etzatlán. The marriage produced one son, Jesus Miguel Silva de Peralta de la Córdoba y Sanchez de Bonilla, in 1781.

In addition to a will, Don Miguel created several additional documents to ensure his son would inherit his complete estate. In 1788, Don Miguel placed a codicil in Guadalajara indicating his wishes. Additionally, Don Miguel went to the trouble in August 1787 of creating a before a notary in Guadalajara documenting the Peralta grant, title, coat of arms, and the ancestry of his son. Don Miguel fell ill and died aged 116. He was buried in Guadalajara on February 2, 1824.

==First claim==
After completing his work in Mexico, Reavis returned to San Francisco. There, he showed his documents to influential people and wrote several anonymous news articles for the &quot;Examiner&quot; claiming &quot;irrefutable evidence&quot; supported his claim on the Peralta grant. During this time, he also was in negotiations with executives from the Southern Pacific Railroad. The executives were interested in securing a right-of-way for their railroad where their tracks crossed the grant, while simultaneously blocking the Texas Pacific Railroad from doing the same. As a result of these talks, Charles Crocker signed an agreement providing Reavis with US$5000 upfront money and US$50,000 total to secure an easement across the Peralta grant.

Reavis&#x27; first official action came in October 1882, when he filed papers with the Safford, Arizona Territory, probate court showing he had been assigned Willing&#x27;s deeds. The reason for this filing is unclear, as the probate court did not have authority to determine the validity of the claim. The small county seat may have allowed Reavis to better solidify his claim with a minimum of other people taking notice at the time.

The official filing of the claim came on March 27, 1883, in the Tucson office of Surveyor General J.W. Robbins. In addition to Willing&#x27;s deed of purchase, Reavis filed copies of the , wills, codicils, and proclamations he had secured documenting the first baron&#x27;s life. The collection of documents filled two trunks. Following an initial examination of the documents, which lasted into the night, Robins promised to register the claim and begin his investigation as the first stage of the certification.

After filing his claim, Reavis established his base of operations at Arizola, Arizona. This was a location near Casa Grande containing a small set of ruins that had supposedly been used by the first baron as La Hacienda de Peralta. Reavis brought in craftsmen to build a mansion of redwood and red brick on the site, complete with servant quarters, stables, storage sheds, and a protective stone wall surrounding the site.

While the construction was beginning, Reavis began hiring rent collectors and agents. He also opened negotiations with James M. Barney, owner of the Silver King Mining Company. After several weeks Barney agreed to pay US$25,000 for a quitclaim. While a considerable sum for the day, this price was small compared to the profits generated by the mine. Reavis then printed and posted notices throughout the claim instructing residents to contact his lawyer &quot;for registering tenancy and signing agreements, or regard themselves liable to litigation for trespassing and expulsion when the Peralta Grant is, as it must be, validated by the U.S. Government.&quot; Arrangements for newspapers and hired publicists announcing the land grant were made, proclaiming the title was ironclad and included both water and mineral rights.

Soon after, Reavis and his agents began selling quitclaims to gullible and frightened settlers located within the claim boundaries. The prices charged for the quitclaims varied greatly and showed little relation to the value of a property or the current occupant&#x27;s ability to pay. Some residents received demands for as much as US$1,000, while others obtained a release for free or in exchange for a meal or a few drinks.

Initial reaction to the notices by local residents was stunned disbelief. The claim had the potential to nullify all existing land titles within the grant, and most residents were concerned by the threat of possible litigation. When word spread that both the Southern Pacific Railroad and Silver King Mine had agreed to terms with Reavis, concern turned to panic. Many residents reasoned that if the mine and railroad, with their associated financial and legal resources, found Reavis&#x27; claim too strong to fight, then they stood no chance against it. This belief was augmented by Reavis&#x27; willingness to allow any interested party access to inspect his documents. Faced with this challenge, some area pioneers abandoned their homes and land instead of trying to deal with Reavis.

===Collapse of the claim===
Most territory residents vehemently opposed Reavis&#x27; claim and his efforts to sell quitclaims. Leading the opposition were two Phoenix newspapers, the &quot;Herald&quot; and &quot;Gazette&quot;. Beginning in July 1883, the papers called upon area residents not to purchase quitclaims from Reavis. The effectiveness of this call was tainted in November 1883, when &quot;Herald&quot; owner Homer H. McNeil was revealed to have purchased a quitclaim for his property. In response to the public backlash, the embarrassed McNeil was forced to publicly cancel the purchase.

About the time McNeil was returning his quitclaim, the surveyor general&#x27;s office dispatched Spanish-language expert Rufus C. Hopkins to Mexico. Reavis and one of his lawyers followed Hopkins. Upon their arrival in Guadalajara, Reavis made his best effort to become indispensable to the 70-year-old Hopkins. After introducing the Spanish expert to the local archivists, Reavis proceeded to guide him through the archives and point out the location of various documents. In addition to pointing out various bundles that he wished for Hopkins to inspect, Reavis took time to search new sections of the archive. During this effort, he discovered a copy of the December 1748 recommending the initial grant.

While Reavis and Hopkins were in Mexico, Surveyor General J.W. Robbins died from tuberculosis, and was replaced by his chief clerk, Royal A. Johnson. Hopkins&#x27; report on his findings were favorable and indicated the claim was well founded. Johnson was unhappy with the report, noting that while it indicated the seals and signatures all appeared genuine, other parts of the original documents had been received on cursory inspection. Additionally, no copy of Charles III&#x27;s signature had been located for comparison purposes. In a supplementary report, Hopkins indicated that he had found no mention of Peralta or the grant during a brief search of the records in Mexico City.

With the release of Hopkins&#x27; initial report, Reavis proclaimed that confirmation of his claim was just a matter of time. He even began rumors that the U.S. government was planning to offer US$100 million to buy rights to his claim. Johnson, in turn, only reported that the investigation was ongoing and refused to provide additional details to the public. As a result, the surveyor general was labeled as an accomplice to Reavis and vilified by the local newspapers.

While this was going on, Reavis sought to expand his sale of quitclaims from Phoenix, where his efforts were initially focused, to the town of Florence. The initial target of the expansion was Tom Weedin, editor of the Florence &quot;Enterprise&quot;, whom Reavis approached in January 1884. The newspaper editor refused Reavis&#x27;s offer and instead published an editorial calling for creation of a committee to raise funds to hire a lawyer to fight the Peralta grant in court. Shortly thereafter, Anti-Reavis committees were established in Florence, Globe, Phoenix, and Tempe.

Over the next year-and-a-half, Reavis faced two lawsuits. The first came from George Willing, Sr., father of Reavis&#x27; former business partner. The elder Willing claimed that Mary Ann Willing only possessed a life estate on her husband&#x27;s property and could not have legally provided a warranty deed to Reavis. An attempt to raise funds for this suit was made by appealing to residents living within the grant and offering land for 20% less than the price set by Congress. The attempt was unsuccessful. As a result, Willing ran out of funds after a short time and was not heard from again.

The second suit was filed by Territorial Attorney General Clark Churchill to settle title issues with his personal land holdings. To deal with Churchill&#x27;s suit, Reavis employed a strategy of delay and obfuscation. During a February 1884 deposition, Reavis was forced to explain how he had come into possession of the Peralta grant and the nature of his relationship with Mary Ann Willing. Questions into his finances, however, were answered vaguely, with Reavis claiming he would need to consult his &quot;agents&quot; to determine most details. Additional questions regarding the exact boundaries of the grant were answered with similarly vague responses. When the suit came to trial in May 1885, Reavis argued the court did not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of a Spanish grant. The court overruled this and granted Churchill clear title to his property.

Following the ruling in the Churchill suit, United States General Land Office Commissioner W. A. Sparks communicated with Royal Johnson instructing the surveyor general to halt work on verifying the Peralta grant. Johnson willingly honored the request. Territorial residents were elated by news of this event, as it effectively halted Reavis&#x27; efforts. The &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; reported, &quot;The tempest was all in a teapot after all&quot;, while another territorial newspaper ran the headline &quot;Reavis Nailed Up&quot;. Public meetings were quickly organized throughout the territory calling for a final determination on the grant. Sensing the situation turning against him, Reavis hastily left for California. Two weeks later, he was largely forgotten as Geronimo led 144 Chiricahua Apache off the reservation and brought the Apache Wars back to Arizona Territory.

==Second claim==
Before the collapse of his first claim, Reavis realized the complex series of conveyances on which he based his claim to the Peralta grant represented a serious weakness to his plans. To overcome this weakness, Reavis had begun the work to establish an heiress to the grant while he was still preparing his first claim.
Reavis claimed to have heard rumors of a Peralta descendant as early as his 1875 arrival in California. He did not meet the heiress, though, until 1877. While traveling on a train, he spotted a young lady who bore a striking resemblance to the second baroness. After inquiring about her identity and background, and learning she knew of the name Maso, Reavis told her that she was most likely the heiress to a large fortune. As the young lady had no papers establishing her identity, finding them was left to Reavis. The pair exchanged letters until the end of 1882. At that time, Reavis visited her in Knights Landing, California, where she worked as a house servant, and proposed marriage. The couple married in a civil ceremony dated December 31, 1882. Following their marriage, Reavis enrolled his new bride in a convent school to train her in the skills expected of a well-born lady.

After his first claim collapsed, Reavis returned to California to collect letters of introduction to influential New Yorkers from his friends and business contacts. To these, he added a number of Spanish contacts from his association with Spanish reporter Carlos Satana and a friendship with the Spanish consul stationed in San Francisco. Reavis then traveled with his wife, who was presented as his ward, to New York. There, he met with persons such as U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling, former U.S. Congressman Dwight Townsend, Henry Porter of the American Bank Note Company, and Hector de Castro. John W. Mackay was so impressed by Reavis&#x27; papers that he agreed to finance a search of the Spanish archives for additional documents. To this end, Mackay provided him with a US$500/month stipend, an amount sufficient for the Reavis party to travel in a manner consistent with an influential family.

In December 1885, the Reavis party sailed for Europe. Upon reaching Spain, Reavis began searching archives in Madrid and Seville for information related to the second baron and his descendants. Several months of searching were needed before Don Jesus Miguel&#x27;s will leaving his estate to Sophia was located. In addition to the various documents he located in the archives, Reavis also acquired several portrait paintings and daguerreotype photographs of individuals he claimed to have been his wife&#x27;s ancestors. Spanish members of the Peralta and Ibarras, believing Sophia was a long-lost relative, entertained Reavis&#x27; wife while he was performing his search. After he located the desired papers, Reavis and his wife publicly announced their marriage and recorded their marriage contract with the United States legation&#x27;s &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. The announcement was met with a new round of celebrations before the couple left Spain to make a tour of Mediterranean ports. The couple did not return to the United States till November 1886.

Upon his return, Reavis visited New York to renew his acquaintances with various political and business leaders. Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements. James Broadhead, who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, followed his examination by proclaiming, &quot;The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll, and Mr. Hurd, who have pronounced it good. I have associated with them in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs. Mr. J. Addison Reavis is the gentleman who is pushing the claim and his is a man of remarkable energy and persistence.&quot; Roscoe Conkling, in turn, stated, &quot;I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find they all go to show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee.&quot; In addition to the endorsement, Conkling introduced Reavis to Robert G. Ingersoll. Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.

From New York, the Reavis party went to California. There, Reavis obtained an affidavit from Alfred Sherwood certifying he had known Sophia and her parents since her birth, she had been born in San Diego County, California, and that she had been left in the custody of Don Jose R. C. Maso following the death of her mother and twin brother when her father had need to travel to Spain.
By the time Reavis returned to Arizona Territory in August 1887, he was using the name &quot;James Addison Peralta-Reavis&quot;. He went to Tucson to file a new claim on behalf of his wife, Doña Sophia Micaela Maso Reavis y Peralta de la Córdoba, third Baroness of Arizona. Before making the formal filing, Reavis hired a carriage and took a trip to the mountains south of Phoenix. During this trip, his wife and he happened across the &quot;Inicial Monument&quot; that marked her great-grandfather&#x27;s land.

Formal filing of the second claim occurred on September 2, 1887. Included with the official copies and photographs of original wills and codicils was a photograph of the third baroness standing before the &quot;Inicial Monument&quot;. With the discovery of this marker, the claim was shifted south. To address possible inconsistencies with his original claim, Reavis claimed he suspected some of Willing&#x27;s papers to be forgeries, but upon advice of his lawyers, had filed his initial claim to initially establish the grant before U.S. authorities and to buy time while searching for proof of his wife&#x27;s identity. Reavis also posted a US$10,000 deposit to assure an official survey of the grant. Surveyor General John Hise refused to allow the survey, as it would imply government approval of the claim.

===Second baron and his family===

Within the new filings were these additions to the Peralta family story:

The second Baron of Arizona, Don Jesus Miguel, never took an interest in his Arizona property due to the threatening Apache presence. He married Doña Juana Laura Ibarra, a member of a prominent Guadalajara family, in 1822. Something of a spendthrift, Don Jesus Miguel frittered away most of his inheritance. After selling most of his properties, the second baron settled into his Sonora estate. After ten years of marriage, the couple had their only child, Sophia Laura Micaela de Peralta de la Córdoba y Ibarra.

Doña Sophia married José Ramon Carmen Maso in 1860. With his remote location providing a limited selection of suitable suitors, the baron was initially pleased to have found a husband for his 28-year-old daughter. Only after the wedding did he discover his new son-in-law had a reputation as a &quot;gentleman sport&quot; (professional gambler) and ne&#x27;er-do-well in California.

In 1862, Maso was called to Spain to collect some funds owed to the baron and him. Maso left for San Francisco with the baron, his mother, Doña Carmelita Maso, and his then-pregnant wife. No explanation as to why the party did not embark from the more convenient port at Guaymas was ever given. While in Agua Mansa, California, Doña Sophia unexpectedly went into labor and gave birth to twins, one boy and one girl. The twins were quickly baptized at the nearby Mission San Salvador. Complications from the birth occurred and the boy and mother both died. A wet nurse was located and arrangements made for care of the newborn girl by a friend of Maso&#x27;s, John A. Treadway. Maso then continued his journey, while Don Jesus Miguel remained in San Francisco to be near his granddaughter. Several months later, Don Jesus Miguel was summoned to Spain by Maso. They both died in Spain, but not before the baron had filed a codicil to his San Francisco will naming his granddaughter as his sole heir.

In California, Treadway made arrangements with Alfred Sherwood to look after the infant Sophia and Doña Carmelita Maso while he took a business trip. During this trip, Treadway died near Sacramento, California. Doña Carmelita Maso died when Sophia was five. When she was eight years old, Sophia was taken into the house of John Snowball. He remembered the young girl speaking of an inheritance that was to come to her.

===Development plans for Arizona===
Reaction to the new claim by Arizona residents was nearly unanimously negative, with some newspapers publishing open incitements to violence against Reavis. As a result of the opposition, sale of new quitclaims effectively ended.

During his trip to Spain and visits to New York, Reavis had gained an understanding of government and big business finance. He put this new knowledge to work and began offering investment opportunities involving development of Arizona Territory. With the accomplished business leaders he had met in New York advocating the legitimacy of his claim, Reavis began to gain millions of dollars in new funds.
Reavis formed three corporations in rapid succession in 1887, each bearing the name Casa Grande Improvement Company. Each had Reavis as director and well-known business leaders selected to serve as president and vice presidents. The third, the Casa Grande Improvement Company of Arizona, was incorporated in November and absorbed the prior two entities. The company planned to develop the land of the grant by building roads, railways, dams, irrigation canals, telegraph lines, and other improvements, while simultaneously engaging in leasing water rights, selling livestock, and performing other activities. Robert G. Ingersoll was the company&#x27;s first president, while other initial investors included Hector de Castro, Dwight Townsend, and Henry Porter of the American Bank Note Company.

Among the development plans Reavis announced was construction of a large-scale irrigation system. At the core of the system was a proposed masonry dam on the Salt River near its junction with Tonto Creek (near where Theodore Roosevelt Dam was later built) and a dam on the Gila River west of Florence. The proposed cost of these dams was US$2.5 million and US$1 million, respectively.

By the time of the second filing, Reavis was dressing in the finest linen and broadcloth, while his wife wore the products of New York and San Francisco&#x27;s best dressmakers. Finding conditions in Arizona too hostile to his ambitions, Reavis rarely spent time at his mansion in the town of Arizola. His wife and he instead maintained residences in San Francisco, St. Louis, and near New York City, where they entertained the social and financial elite. During one stay in New York, Mrs. Reavis, possibly feeling lonely while her husband was busy with his business dealings, found a two-month-old orphan boy. She adopted the boy and named him Fenton after her husband&#x27;s father. Reavis also purchased a &quot;hacienda&quot; in Chihuahua. In Mexico, Reavis became a patron of various charities, opening a home for the blind and a hospital. Additionally, he built a monument dedicated to Don Miguel de Peralta in Monterrey and donated new altar linens for a cathedral in Guadalajara, Jalisco.

==Fraud revealed==
Following the inauguration of Benjamin Harrison in March 1889, Royal Johnson was reappointed surveyor general for Arizona Territory that July. Despite having been out of office, Johnson had continued to investigate the validity of the Reavis claim. About this time, the acting commissioner of the Land Office had received inquiries as to the status of the Peralta grant. In September 1889, he sent Johnson a letter directing the surveyor general to &quot;please report to me the exact condition of said grant as shown by papers and records in your office, and all the information you can obtain in regard to it.&quot; Johnson responded to this request on October 12, 1889, with the release of &quot;Adverse report of the Surveyor General of Arizona, Royal A. Johnson, upon the alleged Peralta Grant: a complete expose of its fraudulent character&quot;.

Among the issues found in the report with the Peralta grant were:
* Most of the claim&#x27;s 18th-century documents showed evidence of having been written with steel-nibbed pens – a tool rarely used until the 19th century – instead of a quill.
* Printing styles on the Peralta documents differed with documents from the same time period, particularly in the use of the long s.
* Searches of Spanish archives for supporting documents had failed to find information on the Peralta grant in locations where such information was expected.
* Multiple spelling errors and grammar issues were present in the Peralta documents, a situation highly atypical of documents from the Spanish royal court.

Johnson&#x27;s report was met with celebration by Arizona residents, and the once-demonized surveyor general became the toast of the town. The &quot;Gazette&quot; praised the surveyor general&#x27;s intelligence and fairness, while extending the thanks of the Salt River valley. The &quot;Herald&quot;, in turn, printed, &quot;No one has criticized Johnson more than we and these criticisms were founded largely on his own statements, but no one will do Mr. Johnson complete justice for his actions on behalf of the settlers sooner or more heartily give him credit for standing by them in their time of need than the &quot;Herald&quot;.&quot; Governor Murphy even invited Johnson to Phoenix where a public reception was held in his honor.

Response in Washington to Johnson&#x27;s report was more subdued. Reavis had enlisted the aid of Secretary of the Interior John Willock Noble and U.S. Senator Francis Cockrell in his lobbying efforts. As a result, it took until February 20, 1890 for the commissioner of the Land Office, Lewis Groff, to respond to Johnson&#x27;s report. Groff&#x27;s letter to Johnson was generally critical of the surveyor general, but could not disregard the report&#x27;s findings. The letter ended with instructions for Johnson &quot;to strike the case from your docket and notify Mr. Reavis of the action, allowing the usual time for an appeal to the Hon. Secretary of the Interior.&quot;

===Reavis&#x27; response===
In response to Johnson&#x27;s report and the subsequent dismissal of his claim, Reavis filed suit against the United States in the Court of Claims. The lawsuit claimed the government had taken land belonging to Reavis and his wife and sold it to settlers, the government had reserved for its own use, had appropriated excessive water rights from the Gila River, and had denied the plaintiffs of their constitutional right to due process. Reavis sought US$11 million in damages already incurred with provisions in the suit for &quot;further relief and costs&quot; against future damages. Southern Pacific Railroad attorney Harvey S. Brown served as Reavis&#x27; lead counsel, while Robert G. Ingersoll and James Broadhead assisted in preparing the case.

At the time of filing, Reavis and his wife said they were aware that the surveyor general had released a report, but claimed to have been unable to obtain a copy. Following the initial filing, a continuance was filed to allow time for the collection of additional evidence. During this delay, in March 1891, the United States Court of Private Land Claims was created with jurisdiction to adjudicate claims involving old French, Mexican, and Spanish land claims.

After filing suit, Reavis went to California to locate witnesses who were familiar with the details of Sophia&#x27;s youth. During October and November 1890, a series of depositions was held in San Francisco and Los Angeles to take testimony from the witnesses he had located. Key witness located during this process were Miguel Noe, Sr., his son Miguel, Jr., Andrés Sandoval, Alfred Sherwood, and John Snowball. Noe testified to having been a friend of José Ramon Carmen Maso and to having met the second baron during his time in California before his trip to Spain. The testimony included a wide variety of details related to the second baron&#x27;s stay and included Noe accompanying the baron to Sherwood Valley to confirm that his granddaughter was well cared for. The senior Noe&#x27;s testimony was supported by Miguel, Jr., relaying his childhood memories of the second baron. Sandoval testified to having run a boardinghouse and restaurant where the second baron and his son-in-law had stayed while they were in San Francisco. Sherwood provided details of Sophia&#x27;s life from when she had been brought home by John Treadway at four months of age in July 1862, how she had been attended by her wet nurse and grandmother, and how her grandmother had told the young girl of a large inheritance she would someday receive. Snowball, in turn, testified as to how he had taken the orphaned girl into his house when she was eight and raised her till 1876, when she left to work with a dressmaker. Other witnesses filled in additional details of Sophia&#x27;s life between 1879 and 1882.

In addition to details about his wife&#x27;s early childhood, Reavis discovered other witnesses able to relate details about her family. In this manner, additional details were revealed about the second baron and his activities during the 1850s. Another revelation was the existence of a previously unknown third cousin to the third baroness, Miguel Lauro Peralta y Vasquez. Information discovered about this cousin showed that he had traveled through Arizona during the time in which Willing had purchased the rights to the Peralta grant and could potentially have posed as the second baron during the transaction.

A trip to San Bernardino in early 1892 resulted in Reavis discovering baptismal records for the Maso twins, along with a record of burial of mother and newborn son. Following this stop, Reavis returned to Guadalajara to search for additional records. A local historian informed him that some records had been stored in the archives of the &quot;Ayuntamiento&quot; (Common Council). An extended search of these records resulted in a copy of the first baron&#x27;s probate proceedings being found. The apparent reason for why they had never been found in previous searches was that they had been misfiled with a group of 1824 papers, possibly as a consequence of the first baron&#x27;s probate proceedings. Included in these records was a Peralta family genealogy and escutcheon, and showing the first baron&#x27;s promotion to captain of dragoons (1748), declaring the royal intention to make a land grant (1748), and approving the grant (1778).
During the second half of 1892, Reavis had hoped to perform another search for witnesses in the company of James Broadhead. Broadhead&#x27;s duties as a congressman, however, forced a delay of this plan until at least mid-1893. This delay worked for Reavis, as on March 8, 1893, his wife gave birth to twin boys, named Carlos Jesús and Miguel in honor of the first and second barons. Reavis viewed this birth as further proof of Sophia being a twin.

By 1893, Reavis began to develop financial problems. Travel, research, and legal expenses, combined with the maintenance expenses of his various households, had consumed most of his cash. Questions about the status of the Peralta claim, in turn, had dried up most new investments. To maintain solvency and defray his expenses, Reavis made arrangements with a group of Washington and San Francisco businessmen to extend him US$30,000 at the rate of US$2500/month.

With the volume of evidence and witness testimony accumulated, James Broadhead decided that the Peralta case was proven.
Reavis went to Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory, to file his final complaint in February 1893. Land office draftsman William Strover recalled &quot;an express wagon drove up and unloaded an array of boxes and packages, all addressed to the court and marked &#x27;Peralta Grant&#x27;. When all was unpacked, three large tables, placed end to end, were filled with documents, ancient books, [and] pictures, including a large oil painting of the Marquis de Peralta, in his robes as grandee of Spain. There were documents with large leaden seals attached and signed by the king of Spain. There was a complete history of the marquis [and] letters to him and from him.&quot;
After submitting his amended filing, Reavis and his family moved back to his mansion in Arizola.

===Government investigation===

Mathew Given Reynolds, a special attorney for the United States Court of Private Land Claims, was assigned to represent the government in Reavis&#x27; suit. Sevaro Mallet-Prevost, a Mexican-born New York lawyer familiar with Spanish and Mexican law, and William M. Tipton, an expert on document analysis, were assigned to assist. Mallet-Prevost and Tipton were dispatched to Tucson in January 1894 to make an examination of Reavis&#x27; original claim. From there, Mallet-Prevost continued on to the archives in Mexico.

As the archives in Guadalajara were in the process of being moved, Mallet-Prevost began his search in Mexico City. A search of the National Archives found no record of the Peralta grant, but did produce copies of signatures and 18th-century documents for use in later comparisons. From Mexico City, he went to Guadalajara, arriving just after the move of the archive was completed. Upon his return to Santa Fe in April 1894, Mallet-Prevost stated he was &quot;entirely convinced of the spurious character of every paper there filed&quot;.

Mallet-Prevost was then sent to Spain, arriving in Madrid on June 12, 1894. The first place the Mexican-born lawyer checked was the in Seville. There, he found that Reavis had arrived as a tourist and after several days had applied for and was granted permission to search the archives. Reavis searched bundles for several days without success, the archivist assigned to assist him believing the documents he was searching for did not exist. Reavis then requested access to case 77, drawer 3, (file) 31. The assisting archivist was surprised to see a document he had previously never seen in the bundle. This incident was reported to the chief archivist, who ordered that Reavis be carefully watched and that all records be carefully numbered before he was allowed to examine them in the future.

When Reavis later returned to the archive, the prescribed measures had been put into place. At the end of one day, Reavis discovered a document in a bundle he was searching and requested a certified copy of it. The document was in an envelope and the paper folded. No other documents in the bundle were folded, and the document Reavis had found was not numbered as other pages in the bundle had been. Based upon this evidence and testimony from other clerks in the archive that the questioned document had not originally been part of the bundle, an arrest warrant was issued for Reavis. Reavis, however, left Seville before an arrest could be made, and influential friends in Madrid had suppressed any further investigation.

While Mallet-Prevost was at the archives in Spain, Reynolds went to California to perform background investigations on the witnesses Reavis had located. During this process, Reynolds was approached by San Francisco lawyer William W. Allen. Allen informed the investigator, &quot;I have an original contract made by and between Reavis and his wife, and a witness, in which the witness is to receive a contingency fee of fifty thousand dollars if he testifies to a certain statement prepared by Reavis.&quot; Allen later told how Reavis had given Miguel Noe information about Don José Maso, his supposed close friend, for Noe to commit to memory. As part of the agreement, Noe was expected to locate other persons willing to memorize and testify to other events.

On September 6, 1894, the government requested a judge be commissioned to take testimony. Despite protests from Reavis&#x27; attorney, Judge Thomas C. Fuller was appointed. Testimony was taken in Guadalajara between October 16 and 26, 1894. Despite being informed of the proceedings, no one representing Reavis attended the proceedings. The most likely explanation for this is that Reavis could no longer pay his attorneys. The testimony centered on the December 20, 1748, recommending the viceroy make the Peralta grant. When asked about this document, archivist Emitiro Robles Giles testified, &quot;I have searched all those archives in which such a should be found and I do not find it; I have found, however, a record to that effect; I have found in the protocol of the Notory Diego de la Sierra y Dueñas certain documents in relation to the matter, which are notoriously not genuine.&quot;

On January 5, 1895, Judge Wilbur F. Stone left New York to take evidence in Spain. Due to delays in obtaining cooperation from the Spanish government, this process was not completed till March 3, 1895. Following his return, a trial date was set for May 30, 1895. As details of the government&#x27;s evidence became known, the lawyers representing Reavis began withdrawing from the case. Attorney Phil B. Thompson notified the Court of Private Land Claims of his withdrawal in a letter. James Broadhead was unable to continue to represent Reavis due to his appointment as Minister to Switzerland.
In the meantime, Reavis&#x27; money had run out and he was destitute by the time the trial began.

===Civil suit===
The trial for Reavis&#x27; civil action began on Monday June 3, 1895, at 10:00. As neither Reavis nor anyone representing him was in attendance, the court adjourned till 14:00 before beginning without his presence. The first motion was from a lawyer representing a group of 106 individuals related to Miguel Peralta of Wickenburg, Arizona Territory. These real Peralta family members had heard about the case and hoped for a portion of any settlement. In his statement to the court, the lawyer informed the court that:

The Government Attorney ... yesterday afternoon placed in my hands the printed evidence .. and to my mind it did seem as though that grant, upon which Reavis relies—it seems to me, from a cursory examination ... that it is a fabrication, and as such, if such it turns out to be ... I want it distinctly understood by the Court and by the Government Attorney, that we have had nothing to do with it. We wash our hands from all of it.

Presentation of the government case began in earnest on Tuesday morning, Reavis and his counsel still not present. First on the stand was Mallet-Prevost, who testified about language and grammar problems present in some of the Peralta documents. As an example of the problem, he identified one document containing the word , a word not in the Spanish language. Another example was the word , an incorrect past tense of the verb , being used instead of the correct .
Tipton, the government&#x27;s document analysis expert, next took the stand to discuss the 1748 . His examination had found that while the coversheet appeared to be authentic, the only mention of Don Miguel de Peralta was located on a piece of yellowed tissue paper pasted to the paper. He declared the five sheets of paper contained inside the cover to be forgeries due to their style of writing not being consistent with the handwriting in use at the time and the seals being glued to the paper instead of impressed by a metal seal as was the custom at the time of the document.

Following this, Tipton went on to problems with other original papers that had been located during the search of the Guadalajara archives. One group of papers was located in a set of papers related to work done by the notary Diego de la Sierra between 1697 and 1698; the Peralta papers had been inserted between two pages of a bound volume numbered 178 and 179, respectively, printed on paper that was shorter and narrower than the other pages of the book, showed evidence of being folded unlike the book&#x27;s other pages, and were glued in place instead of being bound as was the rest of the volume.

Wednesday began with Mallet-Prevost testifying on his findings during his trip to Spain. He began with the will of Miguel de Peralta, where the only mentions of the name occurred over erasures. Additionally the will indicated it had been recorded in the Registry of Mortgages, volume 23, page 2, leaf 216, in section 122. An examination of that part of the registry found an unrelated document. Tipton and Maller-Provest continued to examine other documents and depositions until later that afternoon. At that time, a telegraph arrived from Reavis asking for a continuance till June 10, 1895. The request was granted.

Reavis first appeared in court on Monday June 10, 1895. His first act was to ask for a continuance so that he could locate new legal representation. When this motion met resistance, Reavis moved to dismiss. Reavis was finally granted a one-day continuance so he could prepare to represent himself.

Tuesday&#x27;s court session began with Reavis taking the stand. Beginning with an account of his early career, he described his meeting Dr. Willing and his trip to Prescott to obtain the Peralta documents. During the testimony, Reavis listed the names of the many influential legal and business figures with whom he had associated. When cross-examined by Reynolds, Reavis employed a tactic of providing excessive and irrelevant details within his answers. Later in the day, Reavis was questioned about his discovery of documents within the San Xavier record books, his 1883 trip to the archives in Mexico, and his trip to Spain.

Wednesday morning&#x27;s session began with Reavis being questioned about his marriage contract to his wife, moved to details on his discovery of the &quot;Inicial Monument&quot;, and was followed by questions about his financial transactions with the Southern Pacific Railroad and Silver King mine.
When questioned about the boundaries of the grant, Reavis testified that he had found a copy of a map in the Mexico City archives, but the archivist had refused to make him a copy, as the map was surrounded by papers the archivist considered to be of a questionable nature. To explain the lack of documents from Mexico City, Reavis stated that the archives of the Inquisition had been sealed and no one was allowed access.
In the afternoon, questioning turned to Reavis&#x27; discovery of the baptismal and burial records in San Bernardino. The subject then turned to Alfred Sherwood&#x27;s 1887 affidavit regarding Sophia&#x27;s noble birth.

During this line of questioning, an apparent contradiction appeared where Reavis had known of Miguel Noe and others with knowledge of Sophia&#x27;s early life as early as 1885, but he did not look for any of these people till 1892. On the morning of June 13, Reavis was forced to admit he had doubted some of the documents in his 1883 filing were genuine, but he had still filed them on advice of counsel, while believing his wife was the true heir. At the same time, he admitted that he had at that time not told his lawyers of his marriage.

Thursday afternoon, Father P.J. Stockman, rector of the church of San Bernardino, testified the records of the baptismal of Mrs. Reavis and her twin brother and deaths of the boy and his mother were forged. During a trip away from the parish, Stockman had left a young and inexperienced priest, Father Joseph O&#x27;Reilly, in charge of the church. The young priest had been convinced to lend the birth and death registers to Reavis, but had failed to inform Reavis that the church kept a separate index that was organized by last name and updated annually.

During Father Stockman&#x27;s testimony, he pointed out differences in the inks between the pages related to Mrs. Reavis and the rest of the ledger. The index made no mention of Doña Sophia Laura or her son, with no evidence of either of their graves in the parish graveyard. This testimony was followed by Father O&#x27;Reilly, who identified Reavis as the person he had given possession of the record books for a period between two weeks and a month. Following the priest&#x27;s testimony, the trial returned to an examination of the documentary evidence. Reavis was granted a request to be excused from the court during this phase of the trial.

Testimony on Friday began with Tipton examining the genealogical document for the Peralta family from the first baron&#x27;s will. His testimony showed the first and last leaves of the document to be genuine documents from the indicated period, but that the pages in between were all forgeries.
This was followed by an examination of the 1742 appointment of Don Miguel Peralta as royal inspector. It was pointed out the bottom of the document contained the line &quot;&quot;. Within this line, an untrained person could see the words and had been written in a darker ink and by a different hand than the rest of the line. Further investigation of the document by Tipton had revealed the document had originally announced the appointment of Pedro Cebrián, 5th Count of Fuenclara as Viceroy of New Spain. Other evidence showed that the name Peralta had never appeared on lists of members of the Military Order of Montesa or the Knights of the Golden Fleece. The rest of the day was taken by Royal Johnson, who testified to the steps he had taken during his investigation of the Peralta claim and how he came to his conclusions. Rufus C. Hopkins testified on Saturday morning about his part in the Peralta claim investigation. During the examination, he admitted to having a limited knowledge of Spanish and having to make educated guesses as to a document&#x27;s true meaning during his translations into English.

After adjourning for the weekend, the trial resumed on Monday, June 17. Local newspapers had reported that Mrs. Reavis had arrived from Denver on Friday afternoon and the courtroom was packed with spectators looking to see the third baroness. Upon taking the stand, she told of her childhood memories and then confirmed her husband&#x27;s claim that an archivist in Seville had demanded a bribe before allowing documents related to the Peralta grant to be copied. She was, however, unable to provide any details about the claim papers. Throughout the proceedings, Mrs. Reavis maintained she was the granddaughter of the second baron despite intense questioning about his existence. Monday&#x27;s testimony ended with Bishop Salpointe stating he was familiar with the San Xavier record book from his historical studies, and the documents related to Miguel de Peralta in the record book had not been present before the book had been sent to Philadelphia for the Centennial Exposition.

The final day of testimony came on June 18. In an attempt to bolster his case, Reavis attempted to show that a portrait of Don Miguel Nemecio de Peralta de la Córdoba bore a strong resemblance to his twins. Other portraits, photographs, and documents were introduced in an attempt to prove the existence of Don Miguel and his family. Closing arguments were presented the next day. The government waived the right to a closing statement, feeling the presented evidence was strong enough to prove their case. Reavis used the opportunity to introduce a bill of 52 objections.

The Court of Private Land Claims presented its findings on June 28, 1895. The decision rejected the claim, finding &quot;that the claim is wholly fictitious and fraudulent&quot; and deeming the various Peralta documents had been forged and &quot;surreptitiously introduced&quot; into the various archives and record books where they were discovered.

===Criminal trial===
Some Reavis associates did not believe the court&#x27;s conclusion. Dr. A. T. Sherwood, who led an attempt to colonize the grant, told reporters, &quot;It is impossible that any one man could have forged all the signatures in this case. Reavis would have had to forge over 200 Spanish documents and signatures. No man could have done it. It is the most improbable thing conceivable.&quot; Despite this support, Reavis was arrested and charged, in a 42-count indictment, with forgery, presenting false documents to the Court of Private Land Claims, and conspiracy to defraud the United States government.
Reavis pled not guilty and requested release on bail. The court set bail and allowed him to send telegrams to his previous business associates requesting assistance. No one was found willing to post the US$500 bail. Reavis spent roughly a year in jail awaiting trial. During this time, his appeal of the civil ruling was denied and his wife moved to Denver. During this time, Reynolds went to California to investigate the witnesses who had testified for Reavis. While there, he discovered the date on John Treadway&#x27;s tombstone showed November 21, 1861, six months before Mrs. Reavis&#x27; birth.

The criminal trial began on June 27, 1896. The trial was mostly a recapitulation of evidence presented during the civil trial. Confronted with the government&#x27;s evidence, José Ramon Valencia and Andrés Sandoval confessed to perjury and testified against Reavis. During his testimony, Valencia stated that he had been given a set of facts by Miguel Noe and was to testify to these facts in exchange for US$20,000 once the claim was confirmed. Noe had left for Mexico following the Court of Land Claims ruling and was not expected to return. Reavis was found guilty on June 30, 1896. On July 17, 1896, he was sentenced to two years and a fine of US$5,000.
Upon hearing the verdict, Reavis told his lawyer that he was sure the verdict would be reversed by the Supreme Court.

==Later life==
Reavis was imprisoned from July 18, 1896, to April 18, 1898, earning a three-month sentence reduction for good behavior. By the time of the release, Sophia was living in Denver with the couple&#x27;s children and working as a milliner. Following his release, Reavis visited San Francisco, New York City, and Washington, DC, in an effort to find new investors to finance his development plans for Arizona. Instead of the reaction he had previously received, people listened politely, but no longer took him seriously. Unsuccessful in finding any investors, Reavis moved to Denver for a time to live with his wife and sons. He also wandered from place to place advocating his vision for a large-scale irrigation system within Arizona. The &quot;group of capitalists&quot; he hoped would finance this dream never materialized.

In 1900, Reavis began the magazine &quot;Peralta Reavis Real Life Illustrated&quot;, in which he promised to provide the complete inside story of the Peralta fraud. The magazine folded after a single issue. The same year, he wrote a memoir that was published in several installments by the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; under the title &quot;The Confessions of the Baron of Arizona&quot;.

In June 1902, Reavis&#x27;s wife filed for divorce on grounds of nonsupport. Following the divorce, little was heard from Reavis. By 1913, he was living in a poor house in Los Angeles. Reavis died in Denver on November 20, 1914, and was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave. Sophia died on April 5, 1934. Her obituary in the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; made no mention of the Peralta grant.

After falling out of the public eye, Reavis became the subject of multiple magazine articles. He was even featured in an official tour book. Among the tales manufactured about the Baron of Arizona by these sources was that Reavis had used paper bearing the watermark of a Wisconsin paper mill that did not exist until the 1870s or &#x27;80s. Such tales discount the skill used by Reavis in the manufacture of his forgeries and the level of inspection they received before faults were eventually discovered.

Reavis&#x27; exploits have been dramatized, and highly fictionalized, in motion pictures and on television. A fraudulent land claim similar to the one created by Reavis was used as a plot device in the 1939 film &quot;The Night Riders&quot;. Reavis&#x27; life served as the basis for &quot;The Baron of Arizona&quot;, a 1950 movie in which Vincent Price played the title role. The long-running TV series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, which recounted famous incidents from the history of the Old West, aired two separate dramatizations of the Arizona land-grant scheme. The 1956 episode &quot;The Baron of Arizona&quot; starred Britt Lomond as James Reavis. In the 1968 episode &quot;The Pieces of the Puzzle&quot;, Reavis was portrayed by veteran film actor Robert Taylor, who at the time was also the host of &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

The mansion that Reavis built in Arizola was rediscovered by the National Park Service in 1953 following years of use as a barn by a local farmer. An evaluation in April 1963 by the Park Service determined restoration of the building was financially infeasible.

==Footnotes==

Several relatives of James Reavis live in Lexington and in Kansas City Missouri.

<text>Sorry, Wrong Number is a 1948 American thriller and film noir directed by Anatole Litvak, from a screenplay by Lucille Fletcher, based on her 1943 radio play of the same title.

The film stars Barbara Stanwyck and Burt Lancaster. It follows a bedridden woman who overhears the plot of murder while on the telephone. By phone, she attempts to contact switchboard operators, police, or others who might help her prevent the crime. Stanwyck was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

It is one of the few pre-1950 Paramount Pictures films which remained in the studio&#x27;s library (the rest are currently owned by NBCUniversal).

==Radio play==
Lucille Fletcher&#x27;s play originally aired on the &quot;Suspense&quot; radio program on May 25, 1943, essentially a one-woman show with Agnes Moorehead as Mrs. Stevenson.

===Plot===
Mrs. Stevenson, an imperious invalid, accidentally intercepts a phone call between two men plotting a murder for that evening. She tries to enlist the help of the telephone operator, the police, and a hospital, becoming more frantic as the time passes. In the final moments of the play, she realizes that she is the intended victim.

===Broadcast history===
The play was performed seven more times, on August 21 of the same year and again in 1944, 1945, 1948, 1952, 1957 and 1960. The final broadcast was on February 14, 1960. Orson Welles called &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; &quot;the greatest single radio script ever written&quot;. In 2014, the broadcast was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry.

==Movie Plot==
The film version of &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; is about three times as long as the original radio play and includes flashbacks to previous events in Mrs. Stevenson&#x27;s life and marriage, as well as scenes showing events involving other characters.

In the film, Leona Stevenson is a spoiled, bedridden daughter of wealthy businessman James Cotterell. Using her phone, she tries to reach her husband, Henry. The servants are absent and she is alone in the apartment. On a crossed telephone connection, she overhears two men planning a murder. The call is cut off without Leona learning much, other than that the deed is scheduled for that very night. When she calls the telephone company and the police, they do not believe her about the murder.

While attempting to reach Henry, Leona recalls her past. Through various telephone calls, she learns that the secretary met Henry that day with an attractive woman named Sally Lord and did not return to the office. Leona recognizes the woman as Sally Hunt, a college friend in love with Henry, who at the time was poor and working in a drugstore. Leona took Henry from Sally, and married him against her father&#x27;s wishes. Sally later married Fred Lord, a lawyer in the district attorney&#x27;s office. From overheard conversations, Sally learns her husband was close to resolving an investigation about Henry. Sally is concerned; she follows Henry and two associates to a mysterious meeting of three men, including Henry, at an abandoned house on Staten Island. The house sign indicates the owner is Waldo Evans, later revealed to be a chemist working for Leona&#x27;s father. Sally arranged to meet Henry to warn him about what she had seen, but he received a phone call, left the table and did not return. Sally later learns that the house was destroyed, &quot;Morano&quot;--an apparent gangster--has been arrested by the police, and Waldo escaped them.

Leona receives a message from Henry, stating he left town to complete some work he had forgotten about and will return on Sunday. Leona calls Dr. Phillip Alexander, the specialist she came to New York to see regarding her lifelong heart troubles. Alexander reveals that he gave Henry her prognosis ten days ago, something Henry kept from her. A flashback shows Leona had occasional cardiac episodes for a number of years before she married Henry, something Henry realized a few years into their marriage, when she suffered a cardiac arrest during a quarrel. It becomes clear Leona tries to use Henry, insisting he work for her father even though he is bored. As their troubles become severe, Leona&#x27;s attacks become more frequent until she is bedridden. However, Alexander diagnoses the problems as purely psychosomatic. Nothing is wrong with her physically, but he thinks she needs psychiatric help.

Waldo calls Leona with a message for Henry. He discloses that Henry recruited him to steal chemicals from the Cotterell Drug Company and sell them for Morano. Henry tried to bypass Morano when Waldo was transferred. However, Morano coerced Henry into signing an IOU for $200,000 in three months to compensate for a lost profit. When Henry protested he had insufficient money, Morano pointed out that Leona had a large insurance policy. With Morano in custody, Waldo stresses that Henry no longer needs to raise the sum. He gives Leona a number to reach Henry, but when she calls she discovers that it is for the city morgue. The distraught Leona calls a nurse at the hospital. A frantic Henry calls Leona from a telephone booth. She hears an unnamed intruder sneaking inside the house, and tells Henry that she is the victim of the murder plot. Henry tells Leona to leave the house; but, paralyzed by fear, she is killed by the intruder and the phone line goes dead. As the police prepare to arrest Henry, he re-dials the phone, and the killer answers and replies: &quot;Sorry, wrong number&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; conforms to many of the conventions of film noir. The film plays in real time with many flashbacks, and adds more characters and backstories. The bedroom window overlooks the night skyline of Manhattan. The film is shot in very dark light, with looming shadows and a circling camera used to maintain a high level of suspense. Hollywood&#x27;s Production Code Administration initially objected to elements of Fletcher&#x27;s screenplay, including its depiction of drug trafficking, and the script was significantly revised to win approval.

==Reception==
&quot;Variety&quot; listed the film as one of the top grossers of the year, earning $2,850,000 in the U.S. alone. Although not as well received as the radio play, with some critics noting the plot is too padded out, the movie adaptation is considered a classic of the film noir genre. Its twist ending is often cited as one of the era&#x27;s most memorable. Stanwyck&#x27;s performance was highly acclaimed, and garnered her a fourth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 86%.

==Adaptations==
* A one-hour radio adaptation of the film was broadcast January 9, 1950 on &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;. Stanwyck and Lancaster recreated their screen roles.
* The original May 18, 1943 broadcast of the radio program &quot;Suspense&quot; featured Agnes Moorehead in the role. It was repeated no fewer than seven times.

* A second live teleplay was broadcast on November 4, 1954, as the fourth episode of the anthology series &quot;Climax!&quot;, starring Shelley Winters and adapted by Fletcher, with music provided by Fletcher&#x27;s former husband Bernard Herrmann.
* A version was produced for Australian television in 1958 starring Georgie Sterling. Sterling had performed in the play on radio in 1948. 
* The concept of the film was used as the basis for the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; 1987 episode &quot;Crossed Up&quot;. 
* A television film aired in 1989 (as an original production for the USA Network), starring Loni Anderson, Patrick Macnee and Hal Holbrook. It was directed by Tony Wharmby and adapted by Ann Louise Bardach.

<text>Jeanne Elizabeth Crain (May 25, 1925 – December 14, 2003) was an American actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her title role in &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949). She also starred in the films &quot;In the Meantime, Darling&quot; (1944), &quot;State Fair&quot; (1945), &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), &quot;Centennial Summer&quot; (1946), &quot;Margie&quot; (1946), &quot;Apartment for Peggy&quot; (1948), &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949), &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot; (1950), &quot;People Will Talk&quot; (1951), &quot;Man Without a Star&quot; (1955), &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot; (1955), &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Joker Is Wild&quot; (1957).

==Early life==
Crain was born in Barstow, California, to George A. Crain, who was a high school English teacher, and Loretta Crain, née Carr. Both of Crain&#x27;s parents were Catholics of Irish descent. By 1930, they were living in Inglewood, California at 822 S. Walnut Avenue. When her parents divorced in 1934, her mother, her sister Rita Marie (who served as Crain&#x27;s stand-in during the mid-1940s), and she moved to 5817 Van Ness Ave in Los Angeles.

Crain began winning leads in school plays at 14 and beauty contests at 15. An excellent ice skater, she first attracted attention when she was crowned Miss Pan-Pacific at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles. She attended Inglewood High School where her father was head of the English department. While still in high school, she was asked to take a screen test with Orson Welles, but she did not get the part. After high school, she enrolled at UCLA to study drama. In 1943, at age 18, she appeared in a bit part in the film &quot;The Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot;, produced by 20th Century Fox.

==Career==
===20th Century Fox===

At age 19, Crain was cast by Fox in her first sizable role, in the romantic drama &quot;Home in Indiana&quot; (1944) with Walter Brennan, in which she played the love interest of Lon McCallister&#x27;s character. The film, shot in Technicolor, was popular at the box office and established Crain as a film name.

Darryl F. Zanuck, head of Fox, gave Crain top billing in &quot;In the Meantime, Darling&quot; (1944), directed by Otto Preminger, where she played a war bride. Her acting was critically panned, but she gained nationwide attention. It resulted in her landing the lead role in &quot;The Shocking Miss Pilgrim&quot; in October 1944, a musical film which was eventually made with Betty Grable as the star.

Crain first received critical acclaim when she starred in &quot;Winged Victory&quot; (1944). She co-starred in 1945 with Dana Andrews in the musical film &quot;State Fair&quot;, where Louanne Hogan dubbed Crain&#x27;s singing. After that, Crain often had singing parts in films, and they were invariably dubbed, usually by Hogan.

&quot;State Fair&quot; was a hit, as was &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), in which Crain played the &quot;good&quot; sister of her &quot;bad&quot; sibling, played by Gene Tierney, both of whom are in love with Cornel Wilde&#x27;s character. Crain became established as one of Fox&#x27;s bigger stars—so much so that Zanuck refused to let her play the comparatively small part of Clementine in &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot; (1946).

Crain and Wilde were reunited in &quot;Centennial Summer&quot; (1946), directed by Preminger, Fox&#x27;s attempt to match the success of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944). More popular was &quot;Margie&quot; (1946), which displayed her ice skating ability, and where she and Conrad Janis danced around the ice rink as her boyfriend, played by Alan Young, slipped and stumbled after them.

She made two films in 1948: &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;, a musical with Dan Dailey that may have included Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s first film appearance; and &quot;Apartment for Peggy&quot;, with William Holden.

===Career peak===

In 1949, Crain was in three films. &quot;A Letter to Three Wives&quot; (1949), where she was top-billed, was a solid box-office hit that won Joseph L. Mankiewicz two Oscars and is considered a classic. &quot;The Fan&quot;, directed by Preminger and based on &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; by Oscar Wilde, was poorly received. &quot;Pinky&quot; brought Crain a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and was one of the year&#x27;s more popular films; however, it was controversial. It told the story of a light-skinned African American woman who passed for white in the Northern United States. Although Lena Horne and other black actresses were considered, producer Darryl F. Zanuck chose to cast a white actress for fear of racial backlash.

Crain had another big success when she starred with Myrna Loy and Clifton Webb in the 1950 biographical film &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, although hers was more of a supporting role. She had a cameo as herself in &quot;I&#x27;ll Get By&quot; (1951) and starred in &quot;Take Care of My Little Girl&quot; (1951), a mildly popular drama about snobbery in college sororities.

Next, Crain paired with Cary Grant in the Joseph L. Mankiewicz film of the offbeat comedy/drama &quot;People Will Talk&quot; (1951). Despite Crain&#x27;s intense campaigning for the female lead, Anne Baxter was initially cast in the part; but when she had to forfeit due to pregnancy, Crain got the role after all.

Shortly after, Crain starred in Charles Brackett&#x27;s production &quot;The Model and the Marriage Broker&quot; (1951). Cast in May 1951, she was Brackett&#x27;s first choice. She was reunited with Loy for &quot;Belles on Their Toes&quot; (1952), the sequel to &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, and got top billing this time.

While still at 20th Century Fox, Crain played a young wife losing her mind amid high-seas intrigue in &quot;Dangerous Crossing&quot; (1953), co-starring Michael Rennie. She starred in &quot;Vicki&quot; (1953), a remake of &quot;I Wake Up Screaming&quot;; and Fox tried her in a Western, &quot;City of Bad Men&quot; (1954). Both films performed only mildly at the box office, and Crain left the studio.

===Universal===
Crain made &quot;Duel in the Jungle&quot; (1954) in Britain and then &quot;Man Without a Star&quot; (1955), a Western with Kirk Douglas at Universal, where she played the lead female role of a hard-nosed ranch-owner.

She showed her dancing skills in 1955&#x27;s &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;, a quasi-sequel to &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; based on Anita Loos&#x27; novel and co-starring Jane Russell. The film was shot partly in Paris and was released in France as &quot;A Paris Pour les Quatre&quot; (&quot;To Paris for the Four&quot;), and in Belgium as &quot;Cevieren Te Parijs&quot;. Later in the 1950s, Crain, Russell, and another actress formed a short-lived singing and dancing lounge act on the Las Vegas Strip.

Crain made the Western comedy &quot;The Second Greatest Sex&quot; (1956), then starred with Glenn Ford, Russ Tamblyn, and Broderick Crawford in &quot;The Fastest Gun Alive&quot; directed by Russell Rouse. It was a big hit. At Universal, she starred with Jeff Chandler in the thriller &quot;The Tattered Dress&quot; (1957), then played a socialite who helps floundering singer and comedian Joe E. Lewis (Frank Sinatra) redeem himself in &quot;The Joker Is Wild&quot; (1957).

At this time, Crain began working in television, playing Daisy in a 1958 adaptation of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and Rose in 1959&#x27;s all-star production of &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; alongside Myrna Loy, Walter Pidgeon, Jane Powell, Ed Wynn, and top billed Tab Hunter.

===Later career===
Crain appeared in fewer films in the 1960s as she entered semiretirement. She starred as Nefertiti in the Italian production of &quot;Queen of the Nile&quot; (1961) with Edmund Purdom and Vincent Price; and in &quot;Madison Avenue&quot; (1962) with Dana Andrews and Eleanor Parker. During this period, Crain appeared—for the second time—as a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, and made guest appearances on the &quot;Riverboat&quot; and &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;.

She again co-starred with Dana Andrews in &quot;Hot Rods To Hell&quot; (1967). Her last films were &quot;The Night God Screamed&quot; (1971) and &quot;Skyjacked&quot; (1972) with Charlton Heston.

==Personal life==

At the height of her stardom in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Crain was known as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Number One party girl&quot;, and she was quoted as saying she was invited to at least 200 parties a year.

Against her mother&#x27;s wishes, on December 31, 1945, Crain married Paul Brinkman, a former contract player at RKO Pictures who was credited as Paul Brooks. He later became a top executive with an arms manufacturing company. They had seven children.

In the mid-1950s, the marriage became rocky and Crain obtained an interlocutory divorce decree. Each claimed the other was unfaithful, and she alleged he was abusive. However, they reconciled on December 31, 1956, and Crain had three more children with Brinkman through 1965.

In the early 1960s, she was one of many conservative actors who spent their time promoting the Republican Party.

Crain was a devout Catholic.

Crain and her husband remained married, although they later lived separately in Santa Barbara County, maintaining an amicable relationship, with Brinkman visiting Crain approximately once a month and on her birthday. Brinkman died in October 2003.

Crain died two months later from a heart attack. Her funeral mass was held at the Santa Barbara Mission. She is buried next to her husband under the name Jeanne Crain Brinkman.

<doc id="183847" wikidata="Q1524538" url="?curid=183847" title="My Foolish Heart (1949 film)">
<text>My Foolish Heart is a 1949 American romantic drama film directed by Mark Robson, starring Dana Andrews and Susan Hayward. It relates the story of a woman&#x27;s reflections on the bad turns her life has taken.

Adapted from J. D. Salinger&#x27;s 1948 short story &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot;, this remains the only authorized film adaptation of Salinger&#x27;s work; the filmmakers&#x27; infidelity to his story was responsible for precluding any other film versions of other Salinger works, including &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. The film inspired the Danish story &quot;Mit dumme hjerte&quot; by Victor Skaarup.

==Plot==
At the sight of one of her old dresses, a young but unhappy woman, who is about to divorce, remembers her first love. The story is then told in flashback.

In 1939 in New York City, student Eloise Winters meets Walt Dreiser at a student party. A few days later, Walt asks her to go out with him. For him, it is only an opportunity to have a good time. When Eloise realizes it, she lets him understand that she is a looking for a permanent relationship. Walt continues to chase her, and eventually both end up falling in love.

World War II breaks out and Walt is drafted into the United States Army Air Force. Before going overseas, he asks Eloise to spend a night with him. At first hesitant, she finally accepts the proposition. Realizing she is pregnant, she decides to hide her condition from Walt because she wants him to marry her only for love and not to legitimize the child.

==Reception==
After being disappointed, according to biographer Ian Hamilton, when &quot;rumblings from Hollywood&quot; over his 1943 short story &quot;The Varioni Brothers&quot; came to nothing, J.D. Salinger did not hesitate when independent producer Samuel Goldwyn offered to buy the film rights to &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut&quot;. His agent Dorothy Olding later explained this uncharacteristic relinquishing of control with the simple statement that &quot;We thought they would make a good movie&quot;.

Indeed, &quot;a good movie&quot; would seem to have been implied by the background of those involved in the production, which included Oscar-winning actress Teresa Wright, and &quot;Casablanca&quot; screenwriters Julius J. Epstein and Philip G. Epstein. (Some years earlier, Salinger had referenced &quot;Casablanca&quot; in his 1944 short story &quot;Both Parties Concerned&quot;; one of its characters, upon learning his wife has left him, re-enacts the &quot;Play it, Sam&quot; scene from the film with an imaginary pianist.) However, the eventual film, renamed &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; and with Susan Hayward replacing Wright at the last minute, was critically lambasted upon its release.

&quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that it was &quot;full of soap-opera clichés&quot;, and, while allowing for &quot;some well-written patches of wryly amusing dialogue&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; rejected it as a &quot;damp fable ... the screenplay turns on all the emotional faucets of a &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; serial&quot;. Goldwyn biographer A. Scott Berg explained that &quot;in the Epsteins&#x27; version, more than had ever been suggested [in the original story] was shown, resulting in a &#x27;four handkerchief&#x27; movie with a farfetched plot&quot;. Berg even called the film a &quot;bastardization&quot;. Because of what Salinger&#x27;s agent later called &quot;&#x27;a terrible movie&#x27; made in the 1950s (sic)&quot; of one of his stories, the author never again relinquished control of his work to Hollywood filmmakers despite persistent interest in a screen adaptation of &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;.

Despite a critical drubbing, the film was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Susan Hayward) and Best Music, Song (Victor Young and Ned Washington for the title song, sung by Martha Mears in a rare onscreen appearance), which has become a jazz standard. The film&#x27;s standing has not improved with time: in 1996 Christopher Durang called it &quot;a soggy love story.&quot; The film critic Andrew Sarris defended the film, although he admitted that as it was his deceased brother&#x27;s favorite film, so much of the movie&#x27;s appeal for him was nostalgic.

<doc id="183851" wikidata="Q1291456" url="?curid=183851" title="Edward, My Son">
<text>Edward, My Son is a 1949 British drama film directed by George Cukor for MGM-British Studios that stars Spencer Tracy and Deborah Kerr. The screenplay by Donald Ogden Stewart is based on the 1947 play of the same title by Noel Langley and Robert Morley. The title character is never seen in the movie and montages of celebratory cakes show the passage of time.

==Plot==
Canadian Arnold Boult and his wife Evelyn are celebrating the first birthday of their son Edward (who is never seen in the film) with their friend, physician Larry Woodhope, in their London home shortly after World War I. Arnold is about to embark upon a new career in finance with Harry Simpkin, who has been released from prison after serving time on fraud charges.

Five years later, Edward is diagnosed with a serious illness requiring a costly operation abroad. With his retail credit business doing poorly, Boult decides to burn down the building in order to finance the surgery with the insurance money. His partner, Simpkin, goes along with the plan despite reservations about the scheme.

As the years pass, Boult evolves into a wealthy, titled financier who will do anything to protect his son. When Edward is threatened with expulsion from his prep school, Lord Boult assumes its mortgage. Time passes, and Evelyn confides in Larry her concern that Edward drinks too much and appears to have no sense of morality. Larry strongly suggests that something be done to control Edward, but Lord Boult feels the young man can do no wrong.

Having served another sentence for fraud, Harry Simpkin comes to Boult and asks for a job. When Boult puts him off, he commits suicide by leaping from the roof of his former partner&#x27;s office building. When the police investigate, Boult&#x27;s secretary, Eileen Perrin, lies that Harry did not come to the office that day. She and Boult become lovers.

A year later, during a tryst in Eileen&#x27;s apartment, the two discover they are being observed by a detective working for Evelyn&#x27;s attorney. Anxious to avoid scandal, Boult breaks up with Eileen, who later dies from an overdose of pills. Boult departs for Switzerland to see his wife and Edward. Evelyn threatens to expose Boult to Edward so that their son will see his father&#x27;s true nature. In return Boult promises he will destroy Doctor Woodhope, who loves her, unless she remains silent. Evelyn acquiesces.

As the years pass, she becomes increasingly unhappy and begins to drink heavily. Edward also has become an alcoholic and is engaged to socialite Phyllis Mayden, although young Betty Foxley, who is pregnant with Edward&#x27;s child, believes he will marry her. Boult informs Betty of Edward&#x27;s engagement and seems ready to pay her off or provide her with an abortion, but she rejects his overtures and proudly proclaims that she can take care of herself.

Edward, serving as a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II, crashes his plane while stunting and is killed along with his crew. Lord Boult, now a widower, has discovered that Larry delivered Betty&#x27;s child. Boult beseeches Larry to tell him its whereabouts. Certain that Boult will have just as corrupting an influence upon the child&#x27;s life as he&#x27;d had upon Edward&#x27;s, Larry refuses, leaving his obsessed old friend determined to do whatever is necessary to find his grandchild. Boult&#x27;s quest is temporarily interrupted when he is imprisoned for having burned down his business decades earlier, but after his release he declares his intent to resume the search.

==Cast==
* Spencer Tracy as Arnold Boult 
* Deborah Kerr as Evelyn Boult
* Ian Hunter as Larry Woodhope
* Mervyn Johns as Harry Sempkin
* Leueen MacGrath as Eileen Perrin
* Felix Aylmer as Mr. Hanray
* Walter Fitzgerald as Mr. Kedner
* Tilsa Page as Betty Foxley
* Ernest Jay as Walter Prothin 
* Colin Gordon as Ellerby
* Harriette Johns as Phyllis Mayden

==Production==
In the play, the title character is never seen, and director George Cukor opted to do the same in the film adaptation. The screenplay closely adhered to the original script, the only major change being Arnold Boult&#x27;s conversion from British to Canadian so Spencer Tracy would not have to struggle with an accent. Tracy initially resisted playing such an unsympathetic character but later told Cukor: &quot;It&#x27;s rather disconcerting to me to find out how easily I play a heel.&quot;

Cukor originally wanted his close friend and Tracy&#x27;s lover Katharine Hepburn for the role of Eileen, but the couple were sensitive about working together too frequently. Cukor also feared casting a major star in the relatively small role would throw the picture off balance and draw attention away from leading lady Deborah Kerr.

Leueen MacGrath ended up as Eileen, reprising a role she had played on stage.

==Reception==
===Box-office===
According to MGM records, the film earned $1,267,000 in the US and Canada and $875,000 overseas resulting in a loss to the studio of $1,159,000.

===Critical reception===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed: &quot;Shallow, perhaps, as a study of the accumulation of power, this drama is nonetheless gripping in its expose of the intimate life of a man in his ruthless rise from poverty to fabulous position and wealth . . . And not only is the story intriguing in its details, but some of the people in it are consistently interesting . . . However, it must be acknowledged that Mr. Tracy . . . fails to give clear definition or consistency to this ruthless man . . . as Mr. Tracy plays him, he is a really decent sort who sells his soul for the sake of his beloved son and whose defection seems to haunt him for the rest of his life. His moments of hard and ruthless dealing, in which his eyes narrow coldly and his jaw sets, are heavily interlarded with gay and smiling gobs of Tracy charm. There is nothing sardonic about him. He is even dull as a personality . . . Say this, however, for the film folks: they haven&#x27;t put Edward on the screen. That major restraint is most welcome.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
Deborah Kerr was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama but lost both to Olivia de Havilland in &quot;The Heiress&quot;.

<doc id="183852" wikidata="Q131277" url="?curid=183852" title="Gifu Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūbu region of Honshu. Gifu Prefecture has a population of 1,991,390 () and has a geographic area of . Gifu Prefecture borders Toyama Prefecture to the north; Ishikawa Prefecture to the northwest, Fukui Prefecture and Shiga Prefecture to the west, Mie Prefecture to the southwest, Aichi Prefecture to the south, and Nagano Prefecture to the east.

Gifu is the capital and largest city of Gifu Prefecture, with other major cities including Ōgaki, Kakamigahara, and Tajimi.

Gifu Prefecture is located in the center of Japan, one of only eight landlocked prefectures, and features the country&#x27;s center of population. Gifu Prefecture has served as the historic crossroads of Japan with routes connecting the east to the west, including the Nakasendō, one of the Five Routes of the Edo period. Gifu Prefecture was a long-term residence of Oda Nobunaga and Saitō Dōsan, two influential figures of Japanese history in the Sengoku period, spawning the popular phrase &quot;control Gifu and you control Japan&quot; in the late Medieval era. Gifu Prefecture is known for its traditional &quot;Washi&quot; paper industry, including Gifu lanterns and Gifu umbrellas, and as a center for the Japanese swordsmithing and cutlery industries. Gifu Prefecture is home to Gifu Castle, the 1,300-year-old tradition of cormorant fishing on the Nagara River, and the site of the Battle of Sekigahara.

== History ==
The land area that makes up modern-day Gifu became part of the Yamato Court around the middle of the fourth century. Because it is in the middle of the island of Honshu, it has been the site of many decisive battles throughout Japan&#x27;s history, the oldest major one being the Jinshin War in 672, which led to the establishment of Emperor Tenmu as the 40th emperor of Japan.

The area of Gifu Prefecture consists of the old provinces of Hida and Mino, as well as smaller parts of Echizen and Shinano. The name of the prefecture derives from its capital city, Gifu, which was named by Oda Nobunaga during his campaign to unify all of Japan in 1567. The first character used comes from Qishan (岐山), a legendary mountain from which most of China was unified, whereas the second character comes from Qufu (曲阜), the birthplace of Confucius. Nobunaga chose those characters because he wanted to unify all of Japan and he wanted to be viewed as a great mind.

Historically, the prefecture served as the center of swordmaking for the whole of Japan, with Seki being known for making the best swords in Japan. More recently, its strengths have been in fashion (primarily in the city of Gifu) and aerospace engineering (Kakamigahara).

On October 28, 1891, the present-day city of Motosu was the epicenter for the Mino–Owari earthquake, the second largest earthquake to ever hit Japan. The earthquake, estimated at 8.0 (surface-wave magnitude), left a fault scarp that can still be seen today.

== Geography ==
One of the few landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gifu shares borders with seven other prefectures: Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Shiga, Mie, Aichi, and Nagano. Japan&#x27;s postal codes all start with a three-digit number, ranging from 001 to 999. Part of Gifu has the 500 prefix, reflecting its location in the center of Japan.
The center of Japanese population is currently located in Seki City, Gifu Prefecture. The center of population is a hypothetical point at which a country is perfectly balanced assuming each person has a uniform weight. The spot was calculated using the 2005 census.

 18 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Hakusan and Chūbu-Sangaku National Parks, Hida-Kisogawa and Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō Quasi-National Parks, and fifteen Prefectural Natural Parks.

===Regions===
Gifu has five unofficial regions, which allows local municipalities to work together to promote the surrounding area. The five regions are Seinō, Gifu, Chūnō, Tōnō and Hida. The borders of the regions are loosely defined, but they are usually delineated among major cities.

===Topography===
The northern Hida region is dominated by tall mountains, including parts of the Japanese Alps. The southern Mino region is mostly parts of the fertile Nōbi Plain, a vast plains area with arable soil. Most of the prefecture&#x27;s population lives in the southern part of the prefecture, near the designated city of Nagoya.

The mountainous Hida region contains the Hida Mountains, which are referred to as the &quot;Northern Alps&quot; in Japan. The Ryōhaku Mountains are also in the Hida region. Other major ranges include the Ibuki Mountains and the Yōrō Mountains.

Much of the Mino region is made up of the alluvial plain of the Kiso Three Rivers, which are the Kiso River, Nagara River and Ibi River. The sources of Kiso river is in Nagano prefecture, and those of the others are in Gifu prefecture. They eventually run through Aichi and Mie prefectures before emptying into Ise Bay. Other major rivers in the prefecture include the Miya, Takahara, Shō, Toki (Shōnai), Yahagi, and Itoshiro rivers.

=== Climate ===

Gifu&#x27;s climate varies from humid subtropical climate in the south, eventually making the transition to humid continental climate in the north.

Because the Mino region is surrounded by low mountains, the temperature fluctuates through the year, from hot summers to cold winters. The eastern city of Tajimi, for example, often records the hottest temperature in Japan each year and is considered to be the hottest city within Honshu boasting an average daytime high of during the peak of summer. On August 16, 2007, Tajimi set the record for the hottest day recorded in Japan&#x27;s history—. Summers are hotter, as the landlocked area becomes a heat island, and the temperature rises even further when hot, dry foehn winds blow over the Ibuki Mountains from the Kansai region. The Hida region, with its higher elevation and northerly latitude, is significantly cooler than the Mino region, although there are sometimes extremely hot days there too. The Hida region is more famous for its harsh winters, bringing extremely heavy snowfall, especially in the northwestern areas. Gifu boasts a high amount of skiing locations. Shōkawa-chō, part of the city of Takayama, is up in the mountains, and its location has led it to be called the coldest inhabited place on Honshū.

===Mergers===
== Economy ==
Traditional industries such as paper-making and agriculture are found in Gifu, but its economy is dominated by the manufacturing sector including aerospace and automotive, with industrial complexes extending from the Nagoya area. A wealth of small component manufacturing is also found, such as precision machines, dye and mold making, and plastic forming.

===Traditional industries===

Gifu is famous for cormorant fishing, which has a history of over 1,300 years. Agriculture is also a major industry because of Gifu&#x27;s vast, arable plains. The forests in the north provide materials for woodworking and for the viewing boats used in cormorant fishing.

The Mino region has long been known for its high-quality paper called &quot;Mino washi&quot;, which is stronger and thinner than most other papers in Japan, and was used by the Japanese military during World War II. Other paper-based products include Gifu Lanterns and Gifu Umbrellas, made in the prefectural capital of Gifu. Other traditional goods include &quot;mino-yaki&quot; pottery in Tajimi, Toki, and Mizunami, cutlery in Seki, and lacquerware in Takayama. Sake is often brewed with clear water from the rivers.

===Modern industries===
Kakamigahara has a large role in the prefecture&#x27;s modern industries. It boasts large aerospace facilities of both Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, as well as many metalworking and manufacturing companies.

Information technology (IT) is gaining a foothold in the prefecture with both Softopia Japan in Ōgaki and VR Techno Japan (part of Techno Plaza) in Kakamigahara. The capital city of Gifu, located between Ōgaki and Kakamigahara, is also working to strengthen its IT fields, too.

===Tourism===
Gifu has many popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to all parts of the prefecture. The most popular places are Gifu, Gero, Shirakawa and Takayama. Gero is known for its relaxing hot springs, which attract visitors throughout the year. Shirakawa&#x27;s historic villages are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Takayama is famous for retaining its original appearance and is often referred to as &quot;Little Kyoto&quot;.

In addition to international tourists, Gifu also plays host to many international events. The World Event and Convention Complex Gifu is available for many types of events. Other areas of Gifu, too, bring international events. The World Rowing Championships were held in the city of Kaizu in 2005. The FIS Snowboard World Cup was held in the city of Gujo in 2008. The APEC Japan 2010 SME Ministerial Meetings were held in Gifu City.

===Science===
The Kamioka area of the city of Hida is home to the Kamioka Observatory underground laboratory. Located underground in Kamioka Mining and Smelting Co.&#x27;s Mozumi Mine, the Super-Kamiokande experiment searches for neutrinos from the high atmosphere, the sun and supernovae, while the KamLAND experiment searches for antineutrinos from regional nuclear reactors. The Super-Kamiokande consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank that is tall and in diameter holding 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water. Some of the 11,146 photomultiplier tubes are on display at the Miraikan in Tokyo. The same facility also hosts the CLIO prototype and KAGRA gravitational wave detector.

== Demographics ==

The prefecture&#x27;s population was 2,101,969, with approximately 1.8 million people in the cities and the rest in towns and villages. The percentage of male and female residents is 48.4% and 51.6%, respectively. 14.4% of the population is no more than 14 years old, with 22.1% of the population being at least 65 years old.

According to Japan&#x27;s census, the country&#x27;s center of population is located in Gifu Prefecture. In 2000, it was located in the former town of Mugi, which has since merged with Seki. In the most recent census in 2005, the center of population has moved slightly more to the east but is still located within Gifu.

== Prefectural symbols ==
Gifu&#x27;s symbol comes from the first character &quot;gi&quot; (岐) of its Japanese name, written in a stylized script, surrounded by a circle, which represents the peace and harmony of the prefectural citizen. It was chosen by contest in 1932.

The prefectural logo (&quot;see right&quot;) expands from the red dot into the center to the outer two lines and, finally, the yellow plain. This symbol was chosen in 1991 for the development and expansion of the prefecture.

The prefecture also has two plants (the milk vetch (renge) and the Japanese yew) and two animals (the snow grouse and the ayu) as symbols. The milk vetch was chosen in 1954, because the prefecture is well known for its abundance of blooming milk vetch each spring. The yew was chosen in 1966, because it is the tree used to make ornamental scepters for the emperor, many of which came from the Hida district. The snow grouse was chosen in 1961, as the birds live up in the Japanese alps and is a nationally protected species. Ayu were chosen in 1989, because the fish is found in many prefectural rivers and is prized for its sweet taste.

<doc id="183853" wikidata="Q6673921" url="?curid=183853" title="Lotharingia">
<text>Lotharingia was a historical region and an early medieval polity that existed during the late Carolingian and early Ottonian era, from the middle of the 9th to the middle the 10th century. It was established in 855 by the Treaty of Prüm, as a distinctive kingdom within the Carolingian Empire, but abolished already in 869-870 when it was divided by the Treaty of Meerssen. It was territorially reunited in 880 by the Treaty of Ribemont, and reestablished as a kingdom from 895 to 900. Since 903, it was organized as a duchy, that existed up to 959, when it was divided in two distinctive duchies: the Upper Lotharingia (southern half), and the Lower Lotharingia (northern half). Regional name (&quot;Lotharingia&quot;, the land of Lothair) was derived from the name of its first ruler, king Lothair II, who received this territory as his share of the Kingdom of Middle Francia. The region comprised present-day Lorraine (France), Luxembourg, parts of modern Germany west of the Rhine, most of Belgium, and Netherlands.

Lotharingia resulted from the tripartite division in 855 of the kingdom of Middle Francia, which itself was formed after the threefold division of the Carolingian Empire by the Treaty of Verdun of 843. Conflict between East and West Francia over Lotharingia was based on the fact that these were the old Frankish homelands of Austrasia, so possession of them was a matter of great prestige as true claimant of Frankish imperial legacy.

==Name==
Lotharingia was known as &quot;regnum quondam Lotharii&quot; or &quot;regnum Lotharii&quot; (&quot;kingdom [once] Lothair&#x27;s&quot;) and its inhabitants &quot;Lotharii&quot; (from &quot;Lotharius&quot;), &quot;Lotharienses&quot; (from &quot;Lothariensis&quot;), or &quot;Lotharingi&quot; (which gives the modern Dutch, German, and Luxembourgish names for the province &quot;Lotharingen, Lothringen,&quot; and &quot;Loutrengen&quot; respectively). The latter term, formed with the Germanic suffix &quot;-ing&quot;, indicating ancestral or familial relationships, gave rise to the Latin term &quot;Lotharingia&quot; (from the Latin suffix &quot;-ia&quot;, indicating a country) in the 10th century. Later French terms such as &quot;Lorraine&quot; and &quot;Lothier&quot; are derived from the Latin term.

==Middle Francia, 843–855==

In 817, Emperor Louis the Pious made plans for division of the Carolingian Empire among his three sons after his death. Unforeseen in 817 was a further heir besides Louis&#x27;s three grown sons. A fourth son, Charles the Bald, was born to Louis&#x27;s second wife Judith of Bavaria in 823. When Louis tried in 833 to re-divide the empire for the benefit of Charles, he met with opposition from his adult sons, Lothair, Pepin, and Louis. A decade of civil war and fluctuating alliances followed, punctuated by brief periods of peace.

Pepin died in 838, and Louis the Pious in 840. The remaining three brothers made peace and divided the Empire with the 843 Treaty of Verdun. Lothair, as the eldest, kept the imperial title and received a long strip of territories stretching from the North Sea to southern Italy. The logic of the division was that Lothair had the crown of the Kingdom of Italy, which had been his subkingdom under Louis the Pious, and that as emperor he should rule in Aachen, the capital of the first Carolingian emperor, Charlemagne, and in Rome, the ancient capital of emperors. Middle Francia (Latin &quot;Francia media&quot;) thus included all the land between Aachen and Rome, and it has sometimes been called by historians the &quot;Lotharingian axis&quot;.

==Kingdom of Lotharingia, 855–900==

In 855, when Lothair I was dying in Prüm Abbey, he divided his kingdom among his three sons with the Treaty of Prüm. To the eldest son, Louis II, went Italy, with the imperial title. To the youngest, Charles, still a minor, went Provence. To the middle son, Lothair II, went the remaining territories to the north of Provence, a kingdom which lacked ethnic or linguistic unity.

Lothair II ruled from Aachen and did not venture outside his kingdom. When he died in 869, Lothair II left no legitimate children, but one illegitimate son - Hugh, Duke of Alsace. His uncles, king of East Francia Louis the German and West Francia Charles the Bald (who wanted to rule the whole of Lotharingia) agreed to divide Lotharingia between them with the 870 Treaty of Meerssen - the western half went to West Francia and the eastern half to East Francia. Thus, Lotharingia, as a united kingdom, ceased to exist for some years. In 876, Charles the Bald invaded eastern Lotharingia with the intent to capture it, but was defeated near Andernach by Louis&#x27;s son, Louis the Younger.

In 879, Louis the Younger was invited by a faction of the West Frankish nobility to succeed king Louis the Stammerer, Charles&#x27;s son, on the throne of West Francia. After a brief war, Louis the Stammerer&#x27;s young sons, Carloman II and Louis III, ceded western Lotharingia to Louis. The border between the two kingdoms was established at Saint-Quentin in 880 by the Treaty of Ribemont.

In November 887, Arnulf of Carinthia called a council of East Frankish nobility to depose emperor Charles the Fat, who by 884 had succeeded to the thrones of all the kingdoms of the Empire. The Lotharingian aristocracy, in an attempt to assert its right to elect a sovereign, joined the other East Frankish nobles in deposing Charles the Fat in 887 and elected Arnulf as their king. The rule of Arnulf in East Francia was initially opposed by Guy III of Spoleto, who became king of Italy, and by Rudolph I of Burgundy, who was elected king in the southern half of former Middle Francia - Upper Burgundy. Rudolph had intended to make himself king over the whole of Lothair II&#x27;s former kingdom, but had to be content with Burgundia.

Arnulf defeated the Vikings in 891 and dislodged them from their settlements at Louvain. In 895, he appointed his illegitimate son Zwentibold as the king of Lotharingia who ruled semi-independently until he was overthrown and killed by Reginar on August 13, 900. The kingdom then ceased to exist and became a duchy.

==Duchy of Lotharingia, 900–959==

The young king of East Francia Louis the Child appointed Gebhard to be the duke of Lotharingia in 903. His title was recorded in contemporary Latin as &quot;dux regni quod a multis Hlotharii dicitur&quot;: &quot;duke of the kingdom that many call Lothair&#x27;s&quot;. He died in 910 fighting Hungarian invaders.

When non-Carolingian Conrad I of Germany was elected king of East Francia in 911, Lotharingian nobles under the new duke Reginar voted to attach their duchy to West Francia, still ruled by the Carolingian dynasty. In 915, Charles the Simple rewarded him by granting him the title of margrave. Reginar was succeeded by his son Gilbert who used the title &quot;dux Lotharingiae&quot;: &quot;duke of Lotharingia&quot;.

When the West Franks deposed Charles in 922, he remained king in Lotharingia, from where he attempted to reconquer his kingdom in 923. He was captured and imprisoned by Heribert II of Vermandois until his death in 929. In 923, king Henry the Fowler of East Francia used this opportunity and invaded Lotharingia (including Alsace). In 925, Lotharingians under Gilbert elected Henry the Fowler to be their king. In 930, Gilbert&#x27;s loyalty was rewarded and he received the prestigious hand of Henry&#x27;s daughter Gerberga in marriage.

On Henry&#x27;s death in 936, Gilbert rebelled and tried to swap Lotharingian allegiance to the West Franks, since their king Rudolph was weak and would interfere less in local affairs. In 939, Henry&#x27;s son and successor, Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, invaded Lotharingia, and at the Battle of Andernach defeated Gilbert who drowned trying to flee across the Rhine.

The dukes of Lotharingia were thereafter royal appointees. Henry I, Duke of Bavaria was duke for two years, followed in 941 by duke Otto, who, in 944, was followed by Conrad. Lotharingia was turned into a junior stem duchy whose dukes had a vote in royal elections. While the other stem duchies had tribal or historic identities, Lotharingia&#x27;s identity was solely political.

King Louis IV of West Francia tried to maintain a claim to Lotharingia by marrying Gilbert&#x27;s widow and Otto&#x27;s sister Gerberga. In his turn, Otto I accepted homage from West Francia&#x27;s Hugh the Great and Herbert II, Count of Vermandois at Attigny in 942. The weak Louis IV had no choice but to agree to Otto&#x27;s continued suzerainty over Lotharingia. In 944, West Francia invaded Lotharingia, but retreated after Otto I responded with mobilization of a large army under Herman I, Duke of Swabia.

==Partition of 959 and later history==

In 953, Duke Conrad rebelled against Otto I, and was removed from power and replaced by Otto&#x27;s brother Bruno the Great, who finally pacified Lotharingia in 959 by dividing it into &quot;Lotharingia superior&quot; (Upper Lorraine or Southern Lorraine) under Frederick I, and &quot;Lotharingia inferior&quot; (Lower Lotharingia, Lower Lorraine or Northern Lotharingia) under Godfrey I.

In 978, king Lothair of West Francia invaded the region and captured Aachen, but Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor, counterattacked and reached the walls of Paris. In 980, Lothair renounced his rights to Lotharingia.

Except for one brief period (1033–44, under Gothelo I), the division was never reversed and the margraves soon raised their separate fiefs into duchies. In the twelfth century the ducal authority in Lower Lotharingia (or Lower Lorraine) fragmented, causing the formation of the Duchy of Limburg and the Duchy of Brabant, whose rulers retained the title Duke of Lothier (derived from &quot;Lotharingia&quot;). With the disappearance of a &quot;lower&quot; Lorraine, the duchy of Upper Lorraine became the primary referent for &quot;Lorraine&quot; within the Holy Roman Empire.

After centuries of French invasions and occupations, Lorraine was finally ceded to France at the close of the War of the Polish Succession (1737). In 1766, the duchy was inherited by the French crown and became Lorraine. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the northern portions of Lorraine were merged with Alsace to become the province of Alsace-Lorraine in the German Empire, which became French territory again after World War I. Today the greater part of the French side of the Franco-German border belongs to the Grand Est region of France.

<text>Come to the Stable is a 1949 American comedy drama film that tells how two French religious sisters come to a small New England town and involve the townsfolk in helping them to build a children&#x27;s hospital. It features Loretta Young, Celeste Holm, Hugh Marlowe, Elsa Lanchester, Thomas Gomez, Dooley Wilson and Regis Toomey.

The movie was based on a story by Clare Boothe Luce, and the screenplay was written by Oscar Millard and Sally Benson. It was directed by Henry Koster. It was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Loretta Young), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Celeste Holm and Elsa Lanchester), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White (Lyle R. Wheeler, Joseph C. Wright, Thomas Little, and Paul S. Fox), Best Cinematography, Best Music, Song (Alfred Newman and Mack Gordon for &quot;Through a Long and Sleepless Night&quot;) and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story.

==Plot==
One winter&#x27;s night, two French sisters, Chicago-born Sister Margaret (Loretta Young) and Sister Scholastica (Celeste Holm), arrive at the small New England town of Bethlehem where they meet Amelia Potts (Elsa Lanchester), a painter of religious pictures. The sisters announce that they have come to build a hospital, and Sister Margaret explains that she was in charge of a children&#x27;s hospital in Normandy during the war when it became a potential target during a military campaign. As many of the children could not be evacuated, Sister Margaret made a personal plea to an American general not to shell the hospital, which the Germans were using as an observation post. The hospital was spared but at the cost of American lives, and Sister Margaret made a promise to God that, in gratitude for saving the children, she would return to America to build a children&#x27;s hospital.

Miss Potts wonders why they chose Bethlehem, and Sister Margaret says that they had received a postcard with a reproduction of a nativity scene painted by Miss Potts, titled &quot;Come to the Stable,&quot; with information about the Bethlehem area. The sisters then decide that a local hill depicted in another of Miss Potts&#x27; paintings would be a good site for the hospital.

After composer Bob Masen (Hugh Marlowe), who is Miss Potts&#x27;s neighbor and landlord, tells the sisters that the hill is owned by Luigi Rossi of New York, the sisters visit the local Catholic Bishop to seek his support for their planned project. He is unable to help them with their project, but does give them a small amount of money to tide them over. When they return to Bethlehem, Bob&#x27;s religious porter, Anthony James, offers them a ride from the railroad station in Bob&#x27;s jeep (he continues to help them throughout the movie).

As Sister Margaret learned to drive a jeep during the war, they arrange to borrow the jeep to go to New York City to find Mr. Rossi and ask him to donate his land. Rossi runs a bookmaker operation and, despite his security, the sisters manage to see him. He tells the sisters that he intends to build his retirement home on the site. As they prepare to leave, Sister Margaret notices a picture, and they learn that Rossi&#x27;s son was killed in action near their hospital in Rouen. The sisters then tell Luigi they will pray for his son. Suddenly, Rossi changes his mind and informs them that the land is theirs if they will install a stained glass window in the future hospital in memory of his son.

Elated, they return to Bethlehem, where Bob and his girlfriend, Kitty Blaine, are listening to a demo of a new song he has composed and the sisters come to thank him for the use of the jeep. Bob then announces that he will be going to Hollywood for twelve weeks to work on a motion picture.

The sisters acquire a three-month option for $5,000 on a former witch-hazel bottling plant opposite the Rossi property for use as a temporary shelter to stage the construction of the hospital. However, when the bishop looks over the papers, he discovers that the purchase price carries a $25,000 mortgage, significantly more than the operating funds the sisters have available. He tells the sisters that he will have to cancel the contract, but at that moment, 11 more sisters and a chaplain arrive from France, having been previously summoned by the sisters following their initial success. The bishop relents, allowing them to stay for the period of the option with the understanding that they must all leave if they cannot raise the additional money within that time, but later remarks to his monsignor assistant that he feels unstoppable forces at work.

When Bob returns from Hollywood with Kitty and three house guests he discovers the now increased number of sisters having a produce-and-arts sale in Miss Potts&#x27; yard, and Bob insists that she evict all the sisters - which is unnecessary, as they are planning to move into the abandoned bottling plant in anticipation of finalizing its purchase. On the day before the option is to lapse, the sisters find themselves $500 short of the necessary amount. That evening, after Kitty performs Bob&#x27;s new song for his guests, they hear the sisters singing a hymn the tune of which is similar to Bob&#x27;s song. Concerned about potential allegations of plagiarism, Bob swears that he first thought of the tune after his Army outfit landed in France four years earlier, but guest Al Newman, a music critic, identifies the melody as a 1200-year-old Gregorian Chant.

The next morning, Sisters Margaret and Scholastica accidentally drive a stake through Bob&#x27;s waterline while building a shrine, and mistake the resulting gusher as a holy sign. Bob visits the real estate agent and arranges to buy the witch-hazel plant in order to keep it out of the sisters&#x27; hands. Sister Margaret, meanwhile, discovers Bob&#x27;s guests playing doubles tennis and arranges a wager for $500 if Sister Scholastica can help Al beat the other couple. Although Sister Scholastica is a former tennis champion, they lose the match.

Later, after Sister Margaret tells the sisters that they must leave, Bob apologetically comes to bid them goodbye and overhears their prayers, discovering that their Mother House is in Normandy, near where he was stationed during the war. When the sisters ask him to pray for them, Bob is moved to change his mind about their project, and the film ends with Bob, Kitty, Anthony, Miss Potts, Mr. Rossi and the bishop all attending the dedication of the temporary home of the hospital of St. Jude.

<doc id="183858" wikidata="Q848662" url="?curid=183858" title="Ventricular fibrillation">
<text>Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the ventricles of the heart quiver. It is due to disorganized electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by sudden cardiac death in the absence of treatment. Ventricular fibrillation is initially found in about 10% of people with cardiac arrest.
Ventricular fibrillation can occur due to coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, electric shock, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis is by an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing irregular unformed QRS complexes without any clear P waves. An important differential diagnosis is torsades de pointes.
Treatment is with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation. Biphasic defibrillation may be better than monophasic. The medication epinephrine or amiodarone may be given if initial treatments are not effective. Rates of survival among those who are out of hospital when the arrhythmia is detected is about 17%, while for those in hospital it is about 46%.
==Signs and symptoms==
Ventricular fibrillation is a cause of cardiac arrest. The ventricular muscle twitches randomly rather than contracting in a coordinated fashion (from the apex of the heart to the outflow of the ventricles), and so the ventricles fail to pump blood around the body – because of this, it is classified as a cardiac arrest rhythm, and patients in V-fib should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and prompt defibrillation. Left untreated, ventricular fibrillation is rapidly fatal as the vital organs of the body, including the heart, are starved of oxygen. As a result, patients in this rhythm will not be conscious or responsive to stimuli. Coma and persistent vegetative state may also result. Prior to cardiac arrest, patients may complain of varying symptoms depending on the underlying cause. Patients may exhibit signs of agonal breathing, which to a layperson can look like normal spontaneous breathing, but is a sign of hypoperfusion of the brainstem.

It has an appearance on electrocardiography of irregular electrical activity with no discernable pattern. It may be described as &quot;coarse&quot; or &quot;fine&quot; depending on its amplitude, or as progressing from coarse to fine V-fib. Coarse V-fib may be more responsive to defibrillation, while fine V-fib can mimic the appearance of asystole on a defibrillator or cardiac monitor set to a low gain. Some clinicians may attempt to defibrillate fine V-fib in the hope that it can be reverted to a cardiac rhythm compatible with life, whereas others will deliver CPR and sometimes drugs as described in the advanced cardiac life support protocols in an attempt to increase its amplitude and the odds of successful defibrillation.

==Causes==
Ventricular fibrillation has been described as &quot;chaotic asynchronous fractionated activity of the heart&quot; (Moe et al. 1964). A more complete definition is that ventricular fibrillation is a &quot;turbulent, disorganized electrical activity of the heart in such a way that the recorded electrocardiographic deflections continuously change in shape, magnitude and direction&quot;.

Ventricular fibrillation most commonly occurs within diseased hearts, and, in the vast majority of cases, is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease. Ventricular fibrillation is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other heart pathologies. In addition, it is seen with electrolyte imbalance, overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs, and following near drowning or major trauma. It is also notable that ventricular fibrillation occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause, the so-called idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation occurs with a reputed incidence of approximately 1% of all cases of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3–9% of the cases of ventricular fibrillation unrelated to myocardial infarction, and 14% of all ventricular fibrillation resuscitations in patients under the age of 40. It follows then that, on the basis of the fact that ventricular fibrillation itself is common, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the Brugada Syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting ECG with evidence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1–V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.

The relevance of this is that theories of the underlying pathophysiology and electrophysiology must account for the occurrence of fibrillation in the apparent &quot;healthy&quot; heart. It is evident that there are mechanisms at work that we do not fully appreciate and understand. Investigators are exploring new techniques of detecting and understanding the underlying mechanisms of sudden cardiac death in these patients without pathological evidence of underlying heart disease.

Familial conditions that predispose individuals to developing ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death are often the result of gene mutations that affect cellular transmembrane ion channels. For example, in Brugada Syndrome, sodium channels are affected. In certain forms of long QT syndrome, the potassium inward rectifier channel is affected.

In 1899, it was also found that ventricular fibrillation was, typically, the ultimate cause of death when the electric chair was used.

==Pathophysiology==


===Abnormal automaticity===
Automaticity is a measure of the propensity of a fiber to initiate an impulse spontaneously. The product of a hypoxic myocardium can be hyperirritable myocardial cells. These may then act as pacemakers. The ventricles are then being stimulated by more than one pacemaker. Scar and dying tissue is inexcitable, but around these areas usually lies a penumbra of hypoxic tissue that is excitable. Ventricular excitability may generate re-entry ventricular arrhythmia.

Most myocardial cells with an associated increased propensity to arrhythmia development have an associated loss of membrane potential. That is, the maximum diastolic potential is less negative and therefore exists closer to the threshold potential. Cellular depolarisation can be due to a raised external concentration of potassium ions K+, a decreased intracellular concentration of sodium ions Na+, increased permeability to Na+, or a decreased permeability to K+. The ionic basic automaticity is the net gain of an intracellular positive charge during diastole in the presence of a voltage-dependent channel activated by potentials negative to –50 to –60 mV.

Myocardial cells are exposed to different environments. Normal cells may be exposed to hyperkalaemia; abnormal cells may be perfused by normal environment. For example, with a healed myocardial infarction, abnormal cells can be exposed to an abnormal environment such as with a myocardial infarction with myocardial ischaemia. In conditions such as myocardial ischaemia, possible mechanism of arrhythmia generation include the resulting decreased internal K+ concentration, the increased external K+ concentration, norepinephrine release and acidosis. When myocardial cell are exposed to hyperkalemia, the maximum diastolic potential is depolarized as a result of the alteration of Ik1 potassium current, whose intensity and direction is strictly dependent on intracellular and extracellular potassium concentrations. With Ik1 suppressed, an hyperpolarizing effect is lost and therefore there can be activation of funny current even in myocardial cells (which is normally suppressed by the hyperpolarizing effect of coexisting potassium currents). This can lead to the instauration of automaticity in ischemic tissue.

===Re-entry===
The role of re-entry or circus motion was demonstrated separately by G. R. Mines and W. E. Garrey. Mines created a ring of excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the ray fish. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the turtle ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, it is necessary that there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium, or underlying scar tissue.

It is possible to think of the advancing wave of depolarisation as a dipole with a head and a tail. The length of the refractory period and the time taken for the dipole to travel a certain distance—the propagation velocity—will determine whether such a circumstance will arise for re-entry to occur. Factors that promote re-entry would include a slow-propagation velocity, a short refractory period with a sufficient size of ring of conduction tissue. These would enable a dipole to reach an area that had been refractory and is now able to be depolarised with continuation of the wavefront.

In clinical practice, therefore, factors that would lead to the right conditions to favour such re-entry mechanisms include increased heart size through hypertrophy or dilatation, drugs which alter the length of the refractory period and areas of cardiac disease. Therefore, the substrate of ventricular fibrillation is transient or permanent conduction block. Block due either to areas of damaged or refractory tissue leads to areas of myocardium for initiation and perpetuation of fibrillation through the phenomenon of re-entry.

===Triggered activity===
Triggered activity can occur due to the presence of afterdepolarisations. These are depolarising oscillations in the membrane voltage induced by preceding action potentials. These can occur before or after full repolarisation of the fiber and as such are termed either early (EADs) or delayed afterdepolarisations (DADs). All afterdepolarisations may not reach threshold potential, but, if they do, they can trigger another afterdepolarisation, and thus self-perpetuate.

====Power spectrum====

The distribution of frequency and power of a waveform can be expressed as a power spectrum in which the contribution of different waveform frequencies to the waveform under analysis is measured. This can be expressed as either the dominant or peak frequency, i.e., the frequency with the greatest power or the median frequency, which divides the spectrum in two halves.

Frequency analysis has many other uses in medicine and in cardiology, including analysis of heart rate variability and assessment of cardiac function, as well as in imaging and acoustics.

===Histopathology===

Myofibre break-up, abbreviated MFB, is associated with ventricular fibrillation leading to death. Histomorphologically, MFB is characterized by fractures of the cardiac myofibres perpendicular to their long axis, with squaring of the myofibre nuclei.

== Treatment ==

Defibrillation is the definitive treatment of ventricular fibrillation, whereby an electrical current is applied to the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles, with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for coordinated contractions to occur again. The use of this is often dictated around the world by Advanced Cardiac Life Support or Advanced Life Support algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly epinephrine, after every second unsuccessful attempt at defibrillation, as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) between defibrillation attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that defibrillation should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.

The precordial thump is a manoeuver promoted as a mechanical alternative to defibrillation. Some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once and only in the case of witnessed and monitored V-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully cardioverting a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset.

People who survive a &quot;V-fib arrest&quot; and who make a good recovery are often considered for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which can quickly deliver this same life-saving defibrillation should another episode of ventricular fibrillation occur outside a hospital environment.

==Epidemiology==
Sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in the industrialised world. It exacts a significant mortality with approximately 70,000 to 90,000 sudden cardiac deaths each year in the United Kingdom, and survival rates are only 2%. The majority of these deaths are due to ventricular fibrillation secondary to myocardial infarction, or &quot;heart attack&quot;. During ventricular fibrillation, cardiac output drops to zero, and, unless remedied promptly, death usually ensues within minutes.

==History==

Lyman Brewer suggests that the first recorded account of ventricular fibrillation dates as far back as 1500 BC, and can be found in the Ebers papyrus of ancient Egypt. An extract, recorded 3500 years ago, states: &quot;When the heart is diseased, its work is imperfectly performed: the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive, so that you cannot feel them … if the heart trembles, has little power and sinks, the disease is advanced and death is near.&quot; A book authored by Jo Miles suggests that it may even go back farther. Tests done on frozen remains found in the Himalayas seemed fairly conclusive that the first known case of ventricular fibrillation dates back to at least 2500 BC.

Whether this is a description of ventricular fibrillation is debatable. The next recorded description occurs 3000 years later and is recorded by Vesalius, who described the appearance of &quot;worm-like&quot; movements of the heart in animals prior to death.

The significance and clinical importance of these observations and descriptions possibly of ventricular fibrillation were not recognised until John Erichsen in 1842 described ventricular fibrillation following the ligation of a coronary artery (Erichsen JE 1842). Subsequent to this in 1850, fibrillation was described by Ludwig and Hoffa when they demonstrated the provocation of ventricular fibrillation in an animal by applying a &quot;Faradic&quot; (electrical) current to the heart.

In 1874, Edmé Félix Alfred Vulpian coined the term &quot;mouvement fibrillaire&quot;, a term that he seems to have used to describe both atrial and ventricular fibrillation. John A. MacWilliam, a physiologist who had trained under Ludwig and who subsequently became Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen, gave an accurate description of the arrhythmia in 1887. This definition still holds today, and is interesting in the fact that his studies and description predate the use of electrocardiography. His description is as follows: &quot;The ventricular muscle is thrown into a state of irregular arrhythmic contraction, whilst there is a great fall in the arterial blood pressure, the ventricles become dilated with blood as the rapid quivering movement of their walls is insufficient to expel their contents; the muscular action partakes of the nature of a rapid incoordinate twitching of the muscular tissue … The cardiac pump is thrown out of gear, and the last of its vital energy is dissipated in the violent and the prolonged turmoil of fruitless activity in the ventricular walls.&quot; MacWilliam spent many years working on ventricular fibrillation and was one of the first to show that ventricular fibrillation could be terminated by a series of induction shocks through the heart.

The first electrocardiogram recording of ventricular fibrillation was by August Hoffman in a paper published in 1912. At this time, two other researchers, George Ralph Mines and Garrey, working separately, produced work demonstrating the phenomenon of circus movement and re-entry as possible substrates for the generation of arrhythmias. This work was also accompanied by Lewis, who performed further outstanding work into the concept of &quot;circus movement&quot;.

Later milestones include the work by W. J. Kerr and W. L. Bender in 1922, who produced an electrocardiogram showing ventricular tachycardia evolving into ventricular fibrillation. The re-entry mechanism was also advocated by DeBoer, who showed that ventricular fibrillation could be induced in late systole with a single shock to a frog heart. The concept of &quot;R on T ectopics&quot; was further brought out by Katz in 1928. This was called the &quot;vulnerable period&quot; by Wiggers and Wegria in 1940, who brought to attention the concept of the danger of premature ventricular beats occurring on a T wave.

Another definition of VF was produced by Wiggers in 1940. He described ventricular fibrillation as &quot;an incoordinate type of contraction which, despite a high metabolic rate of the myocardium, produces no useful beats. As a result, the arterial pressure falls abruptly to very low levels, and death results within six to eight minutes from anemia [ischemia] of the brain and spinal cord&quot;.

Spontaneous conversion of ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals. Defibrillation is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm. This is usually by application of an electric shock to the myocardium and is discussed in detail in the relevant article.

<text>The National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) is the largest interscholastic speech and debate organization serving middle school and high school students in the United States. It was formed as the National Forensic League in 1925 by Bruno Ernst Jacob.

==History==
===20th century===
As a Ripon College student, Jacob created a pocket handbook, &quot;Suggestions for the Debater&quot;. After becoming a professor at Ripon College, Jacob received a letter inquiring about the existence of a debate honor society. This led to the founding of the National Forensic League, with the earliest members joining on March 28, 1925.

The National Forensic League was an honor society that recognized middle and high school students and coaches for participation in speech and debate activities. Students earned merit points for participation and were held to a Code of Honor.

Karl Mundt served as the organization&#x27;s national president from 1932 until 1971.

===21st century===
The League&#x27;s name was changed on May 17, 2013 to the National Speech and Debate Association and the National Speech &amp; Debate Association&#x27;s Honor Society. A press release explained &quot;As a communication organization, we need to effectively communicate who we are and what we do. There is a common misunderstanding of &#x27;NFL&#x27; or &#x27;forensics,&#x27; including confusion with the National Football League or crime scene investigation; changing our name to focus on the activity of speech and debate will appeal to more students, coaches, alumni, sponsors, and the general public.&quot; 

As of 2024, the league has 141,132 student members and 2,000,000 alumni. It has chapters at 3,152 high schools and 578 middle school chapters. Its headquarters are located in West Des Moines, Iowa.

== Symbols ==
NSDA&#x27;s core values or pillars are Equity, Integrity, Respect, Leadership, and Service. After its name change in 2014, the association retained its original insignia, including keys, pins, and seals.

== Membership ==
Members in the National Speech &amp; Debate Association&#x27;s Honor Society earn points and are recognized by increasing membership degrees, including membership, merit, honor, excellence, distinction, special dinstinction, superior distinction, outstanding distinction, and premiere distinction.

== Activities ==
NSDA provides competitive speech and debate activities, resources, comprehensive training, scholarship opportunities, and advanced recognition to more than 140,000 students and coaches each year. The annual National Speech and Debate Tournament marks the capstone of speech and debate activities for more than 140,000 members across the country. Students must qualify for the National Tournament through their District Tournament.

To create standards for national competition, the National Speech and Debate Association defined a number of speech and debate events that are prevalent in the United States that have been adopted by many states.

===Speech===
Speech involves a presentation by one or two students that is judged against a similar type of presentation by others in a round of competition. There are two general categories of speech events, public address events and interpretive events.

* Public address events feature a speech written by the student, either in advance or with limited prep, that can answer a question, share a belief, persuade an audience, or educate the listener on a variety of topics.
* Interpretation events center upon a student selecting and performing published material.

==== Public Address events ====
* Commentary (EXC)
* Declamation (DEC)
* Expository (EXP)
* Impromptu Speaking (IMP)
* Informative Speaking (INF)
* International Extemporaneous Speaking (IX)
* Original Oratory (OO)
* Pro Con Challenge (PCC)
* United States Extemporaneous Speaking (USX)

==== Interpretation events ====
* Dramatic Interpretation (DI)
* Duo Interpretation (DUO)
* Humorous Interpretation (HI)
* Original Spoken Word Poetry (SW)
* Poetry (POE)
* Program Oral Interpretation (POI)
* Prose (PRO)
* Storytelling (STO)

=== Debate ===
Debate involves an individual or a team of students working to effectively convince a judge that their side of a resolution or topic is, as a general principle, more valid. Students in debate come to thoroughly understand both sides of an issue, having researched each extensively, and learn to think critically about every argument that could be made on each side.

==== Debate events ====
* Big Questions (BQ)
* Congressional Debate (House and Senate) (CON)
* Extemporaneous Debate (XDB)
* Lincoln-Douglas Debate (LD)
* Policy Debate (CX)
* Public Forum Debate (PF)
* World Schools Debate (WSD)

<doc id="183861" wikidata="Q7229755" url="?curid=183861" title="Public opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq">
<text>The United States public&#x27;s opinion on the invasion of Iraq has changed significantly since the years preceding the incursion. For various reasons, mostly related to the unexpected consequences of the invasion, as well as misinformation provided by US authorities, the US public&#x27;s perspective on its government&#x27;s choice to initiate an offensive is increasingly negative. Before the invasion in March 2003, polls showed 47–60% of the US public supported an invasion, dependent on U.N. approval. According to the same poll retaken in April 2007, 58% of the participants stated that the initial attack &quot;was&quot; a mistake. In May 2007, the &quot;New York Times&quot; and CBS News released similar results of a poll in which 61% of participants believed the U.S. &quot;should have stayed out&quot; of Iraq.

==Timeline==
===March 1992===

In March 1992, 55% of Americans said they would support sending American troops back to the Persian Gulf to remove Saddam Hussein from power.

===2001===
Seven months prior to the September 11 attacks a Gallup poll showed that 52% would favor an invasion of Iraq while 42% would oppose it. Additionally, 64% said that the U.S. should have removed Hussein at the end of the Gulf War.

===Post 9/11 sentiment===
Following the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, United States&#x27; popular opinion was seemingly for an invasion of Iraq. According to the CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, conducted on October 3–6, 2002, 53% of Americans said they favor invading Iraq with U.S. ground troops in an attempt to remove Saddam Hussein from power. The American public&#x27;s support for the war fluctuated between 50% and 60% during the aftermath of the attacks on 9/11.

When asked whether or not the United States should attack a country that has not attacked the United States first, the American public&#x27;s opinion was in support with 51%, whereas when Iraq was embedded into the question the attitude shifted and there was a shift to 66% of Americans agreeing that the U.S. should be able to invade Iraq first.

Despite public concern for the consequences of war the public&#x27;s support remained very high. Original concerns included, 55 percent of Americans fearing that the war would last too long, 44 percent taking into consideration a mass number of casualties, 62 percent of the public being convinced that this would increase short-term terrorism domestically, 76 felt there would be a higher risk of domestic bioterrorism, and 35 believed that the draft would need to be reinstated. At the same time 40 percent of the American public was against having protests because they believed it would undermine the success abroad. Additionally, 55 percent supported the war even without support from the UN.

Approximately two-thirds of respondents wanted the government to wait for the UN inspections to end, and only 31% supported using military force immediately. This same poll showed that a majority believed that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but did not expect UN inspectors to find them. These numbers indicated a dramatic drop in support, as, two months prior, most polls showed about two-thirds of those polled supporting military action. However, about 60% of those polled also supported, if necessary, the use of military action to remove Hussein from power which closely mirrored recent polls taken by Time Magazine, CNN, Fox News, USA Today, CBS News, and other news organizations. Polls also showed that most Americans did not think that Saddam was co-operating with inspectors.

Polls also suggested that most Americans would still like to see more evidence against Iraq, and for UN weapons inspections to continue before making an invasion. For example, an ABC news poll reported that only 10% of Americans favored giving the inspectors less than a few weeks; 41% favored giving them a few weeks, 33% a few months, and 13% more than that.

A consistent pattern in the months leading up to the U.S.-led invasion was that higher percentages of the population supported the impending war in polls that offered only two options (for or against) than in polls that broke down support into three or more options given (distinguishing unconditional support for the war, opposition to the war even if weapons inspectors do their job, and support if and only if inspection crews are allowed time to investigate first).

Some polls also showed that the majority of Americans believed that President Bush had made his case against Iraq. The Gallup poll, for example, found that 67% of those who watched the speech felt that the case had been made, which was a jump from 47% just prior the speech. However, many more Republicans than Democrats watched the speech, so this may not be an accurate reflection of the overall opinion of the American public. An ABC news poll found little difference in the percentage of Americans who felt that George W. Bush has made his case for war after he had made his speech, with the percentage remaining at about 40%.
Following Powell&#x27;s February 5 speech at the UN, most polls, like one conducted by CNN and NBC, showed increased support for the invasion. Tim Russert, NBC&#x27;s Washington bureau chief, said the increases in support were &quot;largely&quot; due to President Bush&#x27;s State of the Union speech in January and to Powell&#x27;s presentation on February 5, which most viewers felt offered strong evidence for action against Iraq. Bush&#x27;s approval ratings climbed seven points, and support for the invasion increased by four points. Only 27% opposed military action, the smallest percentage since the polls began in April 2002. The percentage of Americans supporting an invasion without UN support jumped eight points to 37%. 49% of those polled felt that President Bush had prepared the country for war and its potential risks, a 9-point jump from the previous month. A Gallup poll showed the majority of the population erroneously believed Iraq was responsible for the attacks of September 11.

===Invasion of Iraq===
Although pro-war sentiments were very high after 9/11, public opinion stabilized soon after, and slightly in favor of the war. According to a Gallup poll conducted from August 2002 through early March 2003, the number of Americans who favored the war in Iraq fell to between 52 percent to 59 percent, while those who opposed it fluctuated between 35 percent and 43 percent.

Days before the March 20 invasion, a USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll found support for the war was related to UN approval. Nearly six in 10 said they were ready for such an invasion &quot;in the next week or two.&quot; But that support dropped off if the U.N. backing was not first obtained. If the United Nations Security Council were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action, 54% of Americans favored a U.S. invasion. And if the Bush administration did not seek a final Security Council vote, support for a war dropped to 47%.

An ABC News/Washington Post poll taken after the beginning of the war showed a 62% support for the war, lower than the 79% in favor at the beginning of the Persian Gulf War.

However, when the US invaded Iraq in Operation Iraqi Freedom, public support for the conflict rose once again. According to a Gallup poll, support for the war was up to 72 percent on March 22–23. Out of those 72 percent, 59 percent reported supporting the war strongly; and although allied commanders said they had not yet found evidence of weapons of mass destruction days after the initial invasion, 9 out of 10 Americans believed it was &quot;at least somewhat likely&quot; that the United States would find evidence of these weapons.

President George W. Bush&#x27;s approval rating also jumped at the beginning of the war, going up 13 percentage points at the start of this conflict (Smith and Lindsay).

=== May 2003 – November 2004 ===
A Gallup poll made on behalf of CNN and USA Today concluded that 79% of Americans thought the Iraq War was justified, no matter the lack of conclusive evidence of illegal weapons, and 72% still supported the war even if no illegal weapons are found; only 19% believed the weapons must be found for the war to be justified.

An August 2004 poll showed that two-thirds (67%) of the American public believe the U.S. went to war based on incorrect assumptions. The morale of the US troops has been subject to variations. Issues include the vulnerability of the Humvee vehicles, and the great number of wounded and maimed soldiers 
A CBS poll from September 2004 showed that 54% of Americans believed the Iraq invasion was the right thing to do, up from 45% in July in the same poll.

Finally, in the year leading up to the presidential election in 2004 (November 3, 2003, and October 31, 2004) public opinion began to fluctuate significantly in response to major events in the war, including the capture of Saddam Hussein and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Of the 364 days of news in this year, 348 contained at least one segment that mentioned Iraq. The coverage of the war most often provided reasons for support and rationales for the conflict, with themes most often including &quot;troops&quot;, &quot;threat&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;peace&quot;, and &quot;evil&quot;.

CNN reporter Howard Kurtz reported that the news coverage of the war in the beginning of the topic was too one-sided, writing, &quot;From August 2002 through the March 19, 2003, launch of the war, I found more than 140 front-page stories that focused heavily on administration rhetoric against Iraq: &#x27;Cheney Says Iraqi Strike Is Justified&#x27;; &#x27;War Cabinet Argues for Iraq Attack&#x27;... &#x27;Bush Cites Urgent Iraqi Threat&#x27;; &#x27;Bush Tells Troops: Prepare for War.&#x27; By contrast, pieces questioning the evidence or rationale for war were frequently buried, minimized or spiked.&quot;

This type of coverage quickly changed after the major turning points of the Iraq War. Once it was discovered that there were no weapons of mass destruction in 2004, the New York Times quickly apologized for its rhetoric, stating that its coverage was &quot;not as rigorous as it should have been&quot; and that the Times overplayed stories with &quot;dire claims about Iraq&quot;.

George W. Bush was re-elected with a 50.74% majority of the vote in the presidential election of November 2004.

===Public support for war wanes as U.S. scales back on combat ===
Americans overwhelmingly approved of President Bush and his decisions in Iraq during the major combat phase of the war. This number of those approving of Bush&#x27;s dealing with Iraq reached 80% in April 2003, its highest point in the war.

But in the summer of 2003, after the major combat had ended but U.S. troops continued to take casualties, those numbers began to wane. The period from November 2003 to October 2004 the public opinion on the war varied noticeably. Public support went &quot;from a high of more than 55% in mid-December immediately after the capture of Saddam Hussein, to a low of 39% in mid to late June just before the U.S. transferred power to the newly formed Iraqi government.&quot; The most notable change occurred in the last week of March, when there was an 11-point drop. This was the week of the 9/11 commission hearings, which included Richard Clarke&#x27;s criticism of President George Bush.

After this period, the general trend of public approval was downward, with the exception of a midsummer reversal.

===Public opinion on war plummets in President Bush&#x27;s final term===
On July 4, 2005, the National Council of Churches officially took a stand against the Iraq War calling it dishonorable and urging a change in U.S. policy.

A CBS news poll was conducted from 28 to 30 April 2006, nearly three years after President Bush&#x27;s &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot; speech. 719 adults were polled nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus four percent. 30% of those polled approved of the way Bush was handling the Iraq situation, 64% disapproved, and 6% were unsure. 51% of those polled felt America should have stayed out of Iraq, 44% said the invasion was the right thing to do, and 5% were unsure.

A CBS/New York Times poll was conducted from 21 to 25 July 2006. 1,127 adults were polled nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. Thirty percent of those polled said the invasion of Iraq was worth the American casualties and other costs, while 63% said the war was not worth it. Six percent were unsure. 32% said they approved of the way George W. Bush was handling the situation in Iraq, 62% disapproved, with six percent unsure.

A CBS/New York Times poll was conducted from 15 to 19 September 2006. 1,131 adults were polled nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. 51% of those polled said that, looking back, they felt that the U.S. should have stayed out of Iraq. 44% said the U.S. did the right thing in invading Iraq. Five percent were unsure.

A CNN poll was conducted by Opinion Research Corporation from 29 September to 2 October 2006. 1,014 adults were polled nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. 61% of those polled disapproved of the war in Iraq, 38% approved, with 1% unsure.

A Newsweek poll was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International on 26–27 October 2006. 1,002 adults were polled nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. When asked &quot;From what you know now, do you think the United States did the right thing in taking military action against Iraq or not?&quot; 43% said it was the &quot;Right Thing&quot;.

A Newsweek poll was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International on 9–10 November 2006. 1,006 adults were polled nationwide. When asked if the U.S. did the right thing by going into Iraq, 41% responded yes, 54% responded no, and 5% unsure. The margin of error was plus or minus 3%.

A CNN poll taken on December 15–17, 2006, found that 67% polled opposed the war in Iraq, but that only a majority of 54% believed in an exit over the next year. An LA times poll done a few days previously had found that 65% believe Iraq has become a civil war. The same poll found that 66% believed neither side was winning and only 26% of respondents agreed America should stay &quot;as long as it takes&quot;. Both polls found that 2/3 or more of respondents disapproved of President Bush&#x27;s handling of the war.

A CBS poll of 993 nationwide adults taken on 1–3 January found that under 1 in 4 approve of Bush&#x27;s Iraq policy, up 2 points from the last CBS poll in December. The same poll finds that 82% believe the Democrats have not developed a &quot;clear plan&quot; and 76% believe the same is true of President Bush.

A CNN poll conducted January 11 found that 32% of 1,093 adults polled &#x27;strongly&#x27; or &#x27;moderately&#x27; supported a planned increase in Iraqi troop levels, while 66% &#x27;strongly&#x27; or &#x27;moderately&#x27; opposed the plan. Three percent were unsure. The margin of error was plus or minus three percent.

On May 4–7, CNN polled 1,028 adults nationwide. 34% said they favored the war in Iraq, 65% opposed, and 1% was undecided. The margin of error was plus or minus 3%.

On August 6–8, CNN polled 1,029 adults nationwide. 33% said they favored the war in Iraq, 64% opposed, and 3% was undecided. The margin of error was plus or minus 3%.

On September 10–12, in an Associated Press-Ipsos poll of 1,000 adults conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs, 33% approved of George Bush&#x27;s handling of the &quot;situation in Iraq&quot;, while 65% disapproved of it. On September 14–16, Gallup conducted a poll asking if the United States made mistake in sending troops to Iraq. 58% believed it was a mistake, 41% did not believe it was a mistake, and 1% had no opinion.

On December 11–14, an ABC News/Washington Post Poll of 1,003 adults nationwide found 64% felt the Iraq War was not worth fighting, with 34% saying it was worth fighting, with 2% undecided. The margin of error was 3%.

Before President Bush&#x27;s term comes to an end, passing off the Iraqi war to the next president, the conflicting countries sign a Status of forces agreement where it is understood that U.S. troops would end their occupation of Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, and leave Iraq completely by the end of 2011.

=== President Barack Obama is elected to office, assumes charge of troop withdrawal ===
President Barack Obama is elected into office with the campaign promise of withdrawing troops from Iraq. President Obama issued three executive orders in January of 2009, the first calling for the closure of Guantanamo Bay within one year, the second directing the immediate halt of all ongoing military commissions, and the third suspending the CIA&#x27;s use of &quot;enhanced interrogation.&quot; In February, President Obama announces withdrawal of most United States troops by August 2010 and all troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 following the status of forces agreement. In June, troops leave their posts in cities in Iraq, passing the duties of safety and security onto the Iraqi military.

At the conclusion of the Iraq War in 2011, &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Peyton Craighill expressed that, in the seemingly poisoned atmosphere of American politics, President Obama&#x27;s directive to withdraw U.S. forces from Iraq December of that year, was a rare example of a broadly popular policy decision which showed 78% of all Americans supporting the decision. However, the rapid withdrawal left what both reporters and scholars on global terrorism call a &quot;power vacuum,&quot; which the terrorist group called the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) filled. While President Obama ordered an increase in drone strikes on various ISIS strongholds, he did not increase combat forces on the ground.

March 2013 marked the tenth anniversary of the United States&#x27; invasion of Iraq.

Public opinion toward the overall success of the invasion of Iraq was at an all-time low in January 2014 following President Obama&#x27;s decision to pull troops out of the area. In a poll conducted by Pew Research Center, 52% of those polled said in achieving its goals in Iraq, the United States has failed. This is up by nearly 20% from 2011 when the question was first asked.

=== Public opinion on Iraq War more evenly split 15 years after conflict === 
Fifteen years into U.S. involvement in Iraq, public opinion as to whether military force was appropriate sees a more divided population, although not as stark as previous years. As of March 2018, 48% of Americans polled responded the invasion was the wrong decision, 43% saying it was the right decision, up 4% from 2014. Along party lines, Republicans went from 52% in 2014 to 61% in 2018, and said the U.S. made the right decision in using military force in Iraq. On the other side of the aisle, Democrats have stayed fairly consistent in their views on the conflict, only shifting one percent in the past four years.

=== Support for Iraq War dramatically decreases in two decades since invasion ===
March of 2023 marked the 20-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Public support for the lengthy war significantly decreased over the past two decades. As of 2023, 36 percent of Americans believe the US was right to invade Iraq in 2003, while 61 percent believe it was the wrong decision.

Nevertheless, John Bolton, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and, at the time of the invasion, the U.S. Undersecretary of State, said with 20 years of hindsight, &quot;I would do exactly the same thing.&quot;

<text>This article describes international reactions to the prelude to [[Iraq War]] prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The positions of national on the war may have changed since the invasion.

==Background==
In 2002, the United States began to campaign for the overthrow of Iraq&#x27;s President, Saddam Hussein. The United States, under the administration of George W. Bush, argued that Saddam Hussein was a threat to global peace, a vicious tyrant, and a sponsor of international terrorism.

Opinion on the war was greatly divided between nations. Some countries felt that the United States failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hussein had an active weapons program. Others saw the war as an act of imperialism, and charged that the United States just wanted Iraq&#x27;s oil.

On the other side, supporting countries argued that Saddam Hussein was one of the 20th Century&#x27;s worst despots, and that free countries should be obliged to remove brutal dictators from power. Others felt that Saddam&#x27;s ties to terror groups were well-established, and his weapons programs very real. Although the U.S. has yet to find the location of the WMDs, they did find records of bank transactions from some of Saddam&#x27;s accounts that paid various suicide bombers&#x27; families $25,000 in exchange for their sons&#x27; martyrdom. Supporters also argue that the chemical and biological weapons that were believed to be in Saddam&#x27;s control were shipped to Syria before the engagement and that the current existence of bio and chemical weapons labs in Iraq are an indication of Saddam&#x27;s continued desire to produce WMDs. Furthermore, supporters point out that although the U.S. does have oil interests in the Middle East, so do the Islamic terror cells who want to gain control of the oil in an effort to pressure the western world. Additionally, they argue that the U.N. rejected the invasion of Iraq because of their involvement in the &quot;Oil for Food Scandal&quot;, (established in 1995), in which U.N. and Iraqi officials skimmed money to allegedly bribe U.N. officials. Peter van Walsum, the former chairman of the Iraq sanctions committee from 1999 to 2000, speculated in a recent book that Iraq deliberately divided the U.N. Security Council by awarding contracts to France, Russia, and China but not the United Kingdom or United States. Coincidentally it was France and Russia who were leading the opposition to the invasion of Iraq. He also claimed that sanctions were not effective and that the lack of Iraqi cooperation was designed to exacerbate the suffering of his own people. Other allegations included a $400,000 contribution from Shaker al-Kaffaji, and Iraqi-American businessman to produce a film by ex-UN inspector Scott Ritter discrediting the weapons searches.

Scott Ritter points out in his October 19, 2005 interview with Seymour Hersh that the US policy to remove Saddam Hussein from power started with President George H. W. Bush in August 1990. Ritter concludes from public remarks by President George H. W. Bush and U.S. Secretary of State James Baker that the economic sanctions would only be lifted when Saddam Hussein was removed from power. The justification for sanctions was disarmament. The CIA offered the opinion that containing Saddam Hussein for six months would result in the collapse of his regime. This policy resulted in the US military invasion and occupation of Iraq.

== Varying levels of support ==
Analysis of the count reveals the complexities in world diplomacy. Some national governments publicly denounced the invasion plan while at the same time accepting U.S. aid earmarked for the war, or providing to the war effort troops, fueling stations, military support, and/or airspace. Some national governments provided only a semblance of support.

Some nations originally on the White House list disavowed membership in the &quot;coalition&quot;. Furthermore, significant opposition to the war exists in segments of the populations and Parliaments in many of the supporting nations. Adding to the complications, the Bush administration claimed to have the support of some 15 nations that wished to remain anonymous. This bloc has been dubbed by some &quot;the shadow coalition&quot; or, sardonically, &quot;the coalition of the unwilling to be named&quot;.

Support can be so different in nature, from armed troops to use of airspace and bases, logistic support, political support, to participation in reconstruction efforts, that it appears to some to be difficult to exclude most countries from the official list, except Iraq for obvious reasons (although some might claim some movements inside Iraq will probably also help reconstructing their own country).

== Countries supporting the U.S. position ==
Shortly before the Iraq War began, the US government announced that 49 countries were joined in a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; in favor of forcibly removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq, with some number of other countries expressing their support in private. Of the 49 countries, the following countries had an active or participant role, by providing either significant troops or political support: Australia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom and (United States).

Four of these countries supplied combat forces directly participating in the invasion of Iraq: the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland. Other countries have provided logistical and intelligence support, chemical and biological response teams, overflight rights, humanitarian and reconstruction aid, and political support.

=== Europe ===
In late January 2003, a statement released to various newspapers and signed by the leaders of Britain, saying that Saddam should not be allowed to violate U.N. resolutions.

Later, the Eastern European &quot;Vilnius Group&quot; countries, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia —all now members of the EU—, Albania, and the Republic of Macedonia issued another statement on Iraq, in general support of the US&#x27;s position but not commenting on the possibility of a war without support of the UN Security Council. However, as Donald Rumsfeld stated that Slovenia and Croatia were members of the US led coalition, Slovenia&#x27;s government rejected this statement and its Prime Minister Anton Rop reiterated that Slovenia has conditioned the decision to go to war upon a UN Security Council go-ahead to the attack; Croatia&#x27;s President Stjepan Mesić called the war illegal. French President Jacques Chirac commented on the statement of the ten Eastern European countries saying: &quot;It is not well brought up behavior. They missed a good opportunity to keep quiet&quot;. It was believed by some that Jacques Chirac&#x27;s criticism could be presumed to imply that the EU applicants from Central and Eastern Europe, which were not yet official EU members, should not be allowed to join because of the statement. After criticism by the media, Chirac&#x27;s remark was taken back. Romanian President Ion Iliescu called Chirac&#x27;s remarks irrational, saying &quot;such reproaches are totally unjustified, unwise, and undemocratic&quot;. Bulgarian Deputy Foreign Minister Lyubomir Ivanov told reporters &quot;it is not the first time that pressure is being exerted upon us in one or another form but in my opinion this is not the productive way to reach unity and consensus in the Security Council&quot;.

In the Netherlands the first Balkenende cabinet supported the USA. After that government fell in October 2002, there were new elections in January, which were won by the Second Balkenende cabinet who chose to continue their predecessors&#x27; policy. Dutch soldiers were sent to Iraq, and remained until March 2005. Two Dutch soldiers died in Iraq.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Serbia and Montenegro expressed regret that the settlement of the Iraqi crisis could not be accomplished in the United Nations and accused the Iraqi regime of &quot;making its citizens the victims of an irresponsible policy&quot;. Serbia and Montenegro decided not to take part in Iraq invasion though.

==== United Kingdom ====
Throughout the conflict, the United Kingdom&#x27;s government remained the strongest supporter of the U.S. plan to invade Iraq albeit originally seeking a UN Mandate. Prime Minister Tony Blair frequently expressed support for the United States in this matter, while Members of Parliament (MPs) were divided. Blair experienced a significant rebellion from many Labour MPs and in a debate in the House of Commons, he achieved a parliamentary majority with the support of most Conservative MPs and Ulster Unionists. Although the Conservatives were supportive of the Government&#x27;s stance as a whole, a significant minority of their MPs rebelled against the party line, including figures such as Kenneth Clarke. The Liberal Democrats opposed the war, and their MPs were visibly unanimous on the issue. One former cabinet minister delivered a stinging personal attack on the Prime Minister, calling his behaviour &#x27;reckless&#x27;. Robin Cook MP and a few other government ministers resigned to the backbenches over the issue. Clare Short MP threatened to resign from the cabinet, but then remained for two months before finally resigning on May 12, 2003. Cook, a former Foreign Secretary and at the time Leader of the House of Commons, delivered a resignation speech, which was received with a standing ovation. Cook indicated that while he agreed with most of Blair&#x27;s policies, he could not support the war.

Before the invasion, the then UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, advised that the war would be in breach of international law for six reasons, ranging from the lack of a second United Nations resolution to UN inspector Hans Blix&#x27;s continuing search for weapons. Ten days later on 7 March 2003, as UK troops were massing in Kuwait, Lord Goldsmith changed his mind, saying:

I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force... Nevertheless, having regard to the information on the negotiating history which I have been given and to the arguments of the US Administration which I heard in Washington, I accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution.

He concluded his revised analysis by saying that &quot;regime change cannot be the objective of military action.&quot;

The United Kingdom has sent 45,000 personnel from the British Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force, including the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to the Persian Gulf region. The ground component included 100 Challenger tanks. The First Armoured Division&#x27;s 7th Armoured Brigade and 4th Armoured Brigade took part in the war.

Before the war, public opinion polls showed that the majority of British people would have supported the war with a clear UN mandate for war, but were strongly opposed to war without another resolution in addition to Resolution 1441, which indicated that Saddam Hussein would face serious consequences if he failed to comply with the resolution.

==== Poland ====
In March 2003, the Polish government announced that it would participate in a U.S.-led Iraq invasion and sent about 200 personnel. Poland also sent 54 soldiers in an elite GROM commando unit, a logistic support ship, ORP Kontradmirał Xawery Czernicki, with a FORMOZA navy commando unit, and 74 antichemical contamination troops. Polls showed that, as in other central and eastern European countries, the population was generally against the war, although not as strongly as in Spain, Italy, or the United Kingdom.

=== Asia ===

==== Kuwait ====
Perhaps the only major regional ally that supported the US&#x27; action was Kuwait, whose hostility towards Saddam&#x27;s Iraq stemmed from the events surrounding the first Persian Gulf War. The public appeared to consider Saddam to be as much of a threat in 2003 as he was in the past, and were particularly interested in attempts to repatriate many Kuwaiti citizens who had disappeared during the Gulf War, and were presumably languishing in Iraqi jails up until Saddam&#x27;s fall from power.

==== Japan ====
On March 17, 2003, Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi said that he supported the U.S., U.K., and Spain for ending diplomatic efforts against Iraq. He also indicated that no further UN resolution was necessary to invade Iraq.

On March 26, 2003, Japan&#x27;s ambassador to the UN first stated in the Security Council that Japan supported the acts of the U.S. and allied countries. He said that the Iraqi dictatorship possessed weapons of mass destruction and had been continuously
violating UN resolutions for past 12 years.

Japan sent 5,500 troops under the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction and Support Group to Iraq.

At home, the prime minister was strongly opposed in this decision both by the opposition and parts of his own coalition government.
Most Japanese believe that it was motivated purely to improve Japan&#x27;s relations to the US government, which had been improving since the beginning of the Bush administration.

Furthermore, article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (in place after the end of World War II) forbids any Japanese military involvement overseas. Therefore, Japan did not take part in the invasion itself, but did provide logistical support to the US Navy,
which the government considered a non-combat operation, a position that many Japanese disagree with.

====Other Asian countries====
Singapore (who shortly after reached a Free Trade Agreement with the US), the Philippines, and South Korea all pledged support for the war, as did a number of smaller Pacific island nations.

The Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau (former American trust territories with a combined population of around 186,000) are legally sovereign and are full member states of the United Nations; however, their governments are largely dependent on the United States Congress for their funding through Compacts of Free Association. Some critics of the war assert that if these states took anti-war stances, they would be severely harmed politically and economically because of their reliance on the United States.

=== Australia ===
The Howard government in Australia was a strong and largely uncritical supporter of United States policy. Australia has committed a little over 2,000 military personnel, including a squadron of F/A-18 Hornet fighters and 150 SAS troops (see Australian contribution to the 2003 Gulf War for details). At first, the Australian public was clearly and consistently opposed to their government&#x27;s joining the war without explicit UN backing (around 60 to 70% of those polled), but once the war began public opinion swayed somewhat: a reputable wartime poll had support at 57% with 36% opposed. A March 2006 poll by UMR Research, on behalf of the Labor-linked political consultancy Hawker Britton, found 65% of respondents believed Australia should leave Iraq immediately or no later than May of that year. The Labor Party, on the whole, opposed the war. Major anti-war demonstrations were reported from Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, and Hobart, as well as other Australian cities.

== Countries opposing the U.S. position ==
Some nations that were allies of the United States during the Gulf War were either opposed to the second Iraq War or were reluctant to help with it. Before the war, several countries called on the US to wait for the weapons inspectors to complete their investigations. However, the US and its allies maintained that reasonable patience had been given to Saddam and that it was clear that he was not willing to cooperate with the inspectors, as he beat around the bush whenever the weapons of mass destruction issue came up. This, if not the fact that the inspectors had previously been kicked out of Iraq in 1998 alone, was, according to the war&#x27;s supporters, sufficient violation of UN mandates to justify more severe action. Scott Ritter, chief UN weapons inspector at the time, says that the inspectors were &quot;not&quot; kicked out by Saddam Hussein, but were withdrawn by Bill Clinton:

Many argued that, since Iraq had no connection to the September 11, 2001 attacks, going to war against Iraq as part of a broader war on terror was illegitimate. Others opposed to US military action argued that insufficient and, as in the case of the uranium Niger deal, even falsified documents might have been produced in order to show Iraq as &quot;an immediate threat&quot;. Accordingly, any such exaggeration would have been contrary to international law. They also claimed that the issue of weapons of mass destruction (if indeed there were any left in Iraq by 2003) could have been solved through continued inspections and diplomacy, and insisted that the weapons issue was merely an attempt to hide American desires to seize oil wells, further a military presence in the Middle East, and frighten other OPEC nations into submission. This position was later supported by Bush&#x27;s former Secretary of the Treasury Paul Henry O&#x27;Neill who stated that the administration had sought for a reason to invade Iraq ever since Bush took office, with potential oil spoils charted in early documents. The Bush camp denies these allegations as ludicrous, though they have admitted that the Niger uranium documents were given to them by a source of questionable credibility and it was simply a mistake on their part to have assumed that the documents told the truth.

===Europe===
On January 29, 2003, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution opposing unilateral military action against Iraq by the United States. According to the resolution, &quot;a pre-emptive strike would not be in accordance with international law and the UN Charter and would lead to a deeper crisis involving other countries in the region&quot;.

France, Germany and Russia were from the very outset publicly opposed to a US-led war. As the US took a more militaristic position, these three nations&#x27; governments became increasingly outspoken in opposition to the invasion. In the end, France made it clear it would use its UN Security Council veto against a proposed resolution for war in Iraq at that given point. (See The UN Security Council and the Iraq war.)

On March 17, 2003, the US and Britain stated that they would not submit a resolution to the Security Council, admitting they did not have enough votes to force France or Russia to use a veto. In fact, only Bulgaria and Spain (in addition to the US and UK) declared outright that they wanted to vote for the U.S./UK resolution, while a few more nations, such as Chile and Guinea, had only said they would consider supporting it.

Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Austria and Liechtenstein also condemned the war. The Czech Republic, Croatia, and Slovenia were already mentioned above.

====France====

Though Bush and Blair were optimistic that the 9 out of 15 votes of approval necessary to pass a UN resolution would have been reached, France&#x27;s threatened veto would have immediately quashed the resolution, as any one of the United Kingdom, the United States, Russia, China, and France, had (and has) the unilateral power to veto any resolution, even if the vote is 11–1 in favor. Russia and China expressed that they likely would have supported the UN resolution if some more diplomatic channels had been exercised first, but Bush and Blair stopped trying to persuade those two nations once France voiced its opposition to the resolution. Amid US government anger at what it claimed was France&#x27;s reckless use of its veto power, the French government pointed to numerous examples of times when the USA had vetoed such resolutions that otherwise had an 11–1 margin.

==== Germany ====

German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder made his opposition to the invasion an issue in his electoral campaign. Some analysts credited Schröder&#x27;s come-from-behind victory on September 22 to tapping a broad anti-war sentiment among the German people. His critics and the proponents of the Iraq War suggested that he was using the controversy of the war and appealing to the anti-American sentiment felt by the German public for the sole purpose of gaining popularity and winning. This notion deeply offended the American administration and led to a straining of relations between the two nations. However, Schröder met Colin Powell and a rapprochement was established after the Iraqi regime was overturned. At present the governments of the two nations have agreed to put the Iraq issue behind them and move forward.

==== Greece ====
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis&#x27;s declaration on 21 March 2003 mirrored the official Greek position regarding the invasion, as he declares: &quot;Greece is not participating in the war and will not get entangled in it.&quot; In addition, Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou expressed Greece&#x27;s opposition to the United States going it alone in Iraq. Many other political parties condemned the invasion, such as the Communist Party (KKE) and the Greek Left Party-Synaspismos, who saw the war as proof of U.S imperialistic aspirations in the Middle East. Despite opposing the war, Greece did agree with the United States policy of disarming Iraq and destructing any WMD, that Iraq supposedly possessed. However, Greece did not agree with Bush&#x27;s strategy of pre-emptive war as a means of fighting terrorism. By contrast it was in favor of settling the dispute over Iraq by diplomatic means and not by force.

==== Turkey ====
Turkey originally showed reservations, fearing that a power vacuum after Saddam&#x27;s defeat might have given rise to a Kurdish state On 1 March 2003 the Turkish parliament failed narrowly to approve a government motion to permit the deployment in Turkey for six months of 62,000 US troops, 255 jet aircraft, and 65 helicopters.

In December 2002, Turkey moved approximately 15,000 soldiers to its border with Iraq. The Turkish General Staff stated that this move was in light of recent developments and did not indicate an attack was imminent. In January 2003, the Turkish foreign minister, Yasar Yakis, said he was examining documents from the time of the Ottoman Empire in order to determine whether Turkey had a claim to the oil fields around the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.

In late January 2003, Turkey invited at least five other regional countries to a &quot;&#x27;last-chance&#x27; meeting to avert a US-led war against Iraq. The group urged neighboring Iraq to continue cooperating with the UN inspections, and publicly stated that &quot;military strikes on Iraq might further destabilize the Middle East region&quot;.

In the end, Turkey did not grant access to its land and harbours as asked for by U.S. officials because the Grand National Assembly of Turkey voted against this proposal. Nonetheless, Turkey was named by the Bush Administration as a part of the &quot;Coalition of the Willing.&quot;

====Russia====
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov joined France and Germany and said the council could not ignore the fact that &quot;substantial progress&quot; had been made since chief weapons inspector Hans Blix and International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Mohamed El Baradei visited Iraq in January.

====Belarus====
President Alexander Lukashenko said Belarus unanimously denounced US aggression in Iraq.

==== Finland ====
In Finland, Anneli Jäätteenmäki of the Centre Party won the elections after she had accused her rival Paavo Lipponen, who was prime minister at the time, of allying neutral Finland with the United States in the war in Iraq during a meeting with President George W. Bush. Lipponen denied the claims and declared that &quot;We support the UN and the UN Secretary-General.&quot; Jäätteenmäki resigned as prime minister after 63 days in office amid accusations that she had lied about the leak of the documents about the meeting between Bush and Lipponen. This series of events was considered scandalous and it is named Iraq leak or Iraq-gate. The main point was that special advisor of President of Finland had leaked series of documents which were considered secret. Special advisor Martti Manninen gave these secret documents to Anneli Jäätteenmäki, who used information provided by these documents to accuse Paavo Lipponen of supporting the Iraq War. The secret documents included a memo or memos of discussions between George W. Bush and Paavo Lipponen. Later on criminal charges were pressed against Martti Manninen for leaking secret documents and against Anneli Jäätteenmäki for incitement and aid to the same.

The Finnish government stated that they took a stronger stand on the Iraq question at a meeting chaired by President Tarja Halonen. The meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign and Security Policy issued a statement according to which the use of force against Iraq would not be acceptable without the authority of the UN Security Council.

==== Vatican City ====

The Holy See took a firm stance against the U.S. plan to invade Iraq. Pope John Paul II&#x27;s special envoy, Cardinal Pio Laghi, was sent by the Church to talk with George W. Bush to express opposition to the war on Iraq. The Catholic Church said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy. According to the Church, the Iraq War, and indeed most modern wars, did not satisfy the just war requirements set by Saint Augustine of Hippo and other theologians. The Church was also worried of the fate of the Chaldean Catholics of Iraq. The Vatican worried that they might see the same destruction as happened to the churches and monasteries after the war in Kosovo. The Secretary for Relations with States, Archbishop Jean Louis Tauran, said that only the UN can decide on a military attack against Iraq, because a unilateral war would be a &quot;crime against peace and a crime against international law&quot;. Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano indicated that only the United Nations Security Council had the power to approve an attack in self-defense, and only in case of a previous aggression. His opinion was that the attack on Iraq did not fall into this category and that a unilateral aggression would be a &quot;crime against peace and a violation of the Geneva Convention&quot;.
==== Demonstrations against the war ====
Millions demonstrated on the streets of Britain, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, France, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Donald Rumsfeld tried to downplay the French and German governmental criticism, most prominently heard because both countries at that time were members of the, as the opinion of &quot;Old Europe&quot;, while he relied on a new situation after the EU enlargement. Opinion polls showed that the war was not supported by a majority of the public in the Central and Eastern Europe either, despite most of their governments&#x27; support.

===Americas===

==== Canada ====
While Canada participated in the Gulf War of 1991, it refused to engage in a war on Iraq without UN approval. Prime Minister Jean Chrétien said on October 10, 2002, that Canada would be part of any military coalition sanctioned by the United Nations to invade Iraq. With the subsequent withdrawal of American and British diplomatic efforts to gain UN sanction, Jean Chrétien announced in Parliament on March 17, 2003, that Canada would not participate in the pending invasion, though he offered the US and its soldiers his moral support. Two days earlier, a quarter million in Montreal marched against the pending war. Major anti-war demonstrations took place in several other Canadian cities.

About a hundred Canadian exchange officers, on exchange to American units, participated in the invasion of Iraq.

On October 9, 2008, the CBC published this statement about 2003:

==== Latin America ====
Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Chile condemned the war. Major demonstrations were reported from La Paz, Bolivia; Lima, Peru; Bogotá, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Santiago, Chile. Pierre Charles, the late Prime Minister of the Caribbean island nation of Dominica also condemned the war.

After Costa Rica&#x27;s Constitutional Court ruled that the war broke international law and that the country&#x27;s support for the war contradicted its constitution, the government declared its withdrawal of support, which was merely moral anyway as Costa Rica has no army. Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic retreated their troops.

=== Africa ===
The African Union, with all of its 52 members, condemned the war. Guinea, Cameroon and Angola had seats on the Security Council, and amid talks of American financial donations would have likely voted in approval of a UN war resolution against Iraq. Major protests were reported from Cairo and Alexandria (Egypt); Rabat (Morocco); Mombasa (Kenya); Mogadishu (Somalia); Nouakchott (Mauritania); Tripoli (Libya); Windhoek (Namibia); Johannesburg and Cape Town (South Africa).

===Arab League===
The Arab League unanimously condemned the war, with the exception of Kuwait. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud publicly claimed that the U.S. military would not be authorized to use Saudi Arabia&#x27;s soil in any way to attack Iraq. () After ten years of U.S. presence in Saudi Arabia, cited among reasons by Saudi-born Osama bin Laden for his September 11, 2001 al-Qaeda attacks on America, most of U.S. forces were withdrawn from Saudi Arabia in 2003. () For the duration of the war, the Saudi public remained strongly against the US action, even regardless of a UN mandate. Before the war, the government repeatedly attempted to find a diplomatic solution, generally agreeing with the US position on Saddam&#x27;s menace, even going so far as to urge Saddam to go into voluntary exile—a suggestion that angered him a great deal.

Anti-war demonstrations took place in Damascus, Syria; Baghdad, Iraq; Sana&#x27;a, Yemen; Muscat, Oman; Amman, Ma&#x27;an, and Irbid, Jordan; Widhat, Beirut and Sidon, Lebanon; Bethlehem, Nablus, Tulkarm, Jenin, Ramallah and Gaza, Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; Tel Aviv, Israel, and in the nation of Bahrain. As is the case in Egypt, demonstrations are not common in many of these less-than-democratic countries and some regimes saw themselves in danger because of riots. The United States requested Egypt to send troops to participate in the U.S. led coalition invasion of Iraq, which was a request rebuffed by Egypt&#x27;s Mubarak.

===Asia===

==== India ====
As the Iraqi crisis unfolded, India had taken the consistent position that Iraq must fully comply with UN Security Council Resolutions for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction from its territory. The Indian Foreign Ministry counsel has been against war and in favour of peace. It has emphasised that all decisions on Iraq must be taken under the authority of the United Nations. The counsel stated that any move for change in regime in Iraq should come from within and not be imposed from outside. The counsel has also been drawing attention to the precarious humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people which war would only aggravate.

The counsel was deeply disappointed by the inability of the UN Security Council to act collectively, specially the failure of the Permanent Members to harmonise their positions on Iraq.

The counsel stressed that &quot;As long as the peaceful disarmament of Iraq has the slightest chance, we would continue to urge caution, self-restraint and high sense of responsibility on the part of concerned parties&quot;.

On 27 November 2002, Indian Foreign Minister Yashwant Sinha called Saddam Hussein &quot;a friend of India&quot; and said that &quot;any military conflict will be disastrous from our point of view and we do not want a situation like the one we faced in 1991 after the Gulf War&quot;. At the same time, both Sinha and Indian lawmakers called Hussein to abide by UN resolutions and allow weapons inspectors.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
Pre-war, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s public position had been one of neutrality in the conflict; worldwide media reported that, despite numerous American attempts, Saudi Arabia would not offer the American military any use of its land as a staging ground for the invasion of Iraq. In an interview, Prince Saud Alfaysal, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s foreign minister when asked whether Saudi Arabia would allow more US troops to be placed on Saudi soil, the foreign minister replied, &quot;under the present circumstances with no proof that there is a threat imminent from Iraq, I do not think Saudi Arabia will join in&quot;. It was also eventually learned that a high-ranking Saudi prince had been at the White House on the day that the Iraq war began, and Bush administration officials told the prince to alert his government that the initial phase of the war had begun, hours before missiles first landed in Baghdad. Officially, Saudi Arabia wished to see Saddam Hussein and the Ba&#x27;ath regime go, but feared the aftermath. As the US invasion of Iraq became inevitable, the question of whether Saudi Arabia wanted the Baath regime replaced by a pro-Western government &quot;pumping oil in greater quantities than Saudi Arabia&quot; posed a dilemma for the Saudi government. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia worried about the possibility of an Iraqi Shia pro-Iranian government installed at its doorstep, following the demise of Saddam&#x27;s Sunni regime. On 4 November 2002, Faysal told CNN that Saudi Arabia would not allow US use of Saudi facilities to invade Iraq. Moreover, in the same month, during a televised address on Saudi television, Crown Prince Abdullah insisted that &quot;our armed forces will not, under no circumstances, step one foot into Iraqi territory&quot;.

==== Syria ====

Syria opposed the war and refused to submit to Washington&#x27;s demand for co-operation. It acted in concert with Russia, France, and Germany in the Security Council, even voting in support of Resolution 1441, mandating the renewal of United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq. Syria&#x27;s UN ambassador, Makhail Wehbe, said he believed that the evidence presented by the United States to the Security Council on Iraq&#x27;s weapons had been fabricated. Syrian commentators explained that none of Iraq&#x27;s neighbors felt it was a threat, and that weapons of mass destruction were a mere pretext for a war motivated by the interests of Israel and the US companies that hoped to profit from post-war reconstruction contracts.

==== Jordan ====

King Abdullah II of Jordan advised Washington against the Iraq War but later gave the invading coalition covert and tacit support, in defiance of the overwhelming opinion of his own public. The Jordanian government publicly opposed the war against Iraq. The King stressed to the United States and European Union that a diplomatic solution, in accordance with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions 1284 (1999) and 1409 (2002), was the only appropriate model for resolving the conflict between Iraq and the UN. In August 2002 he told the Washington Post that an attempt to invade Iraq would be a &quot;tremendous mistake&quot; and that it could &quot;throw the whole area into turmoil&quot;.

==== China ====

China pressed for continued U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq after two arms inspectors told the Security Council they had found no evidence of weapons of mass destruction. Beijing insisted on staking out a “principled” and independent position on U.S. intervention in Iraq. Although it stated its wish that the situation be resolved peacefully, China did not threaten to exercise its Security Council veto and had abstained in many previous decisions on Iraq.

During the Iraq war of 2003, China vehemently demanded Iraq to comply with the UN Security Council Resolution 1441 but opposed the use of force to secure Iraqi compliance. However, when the war broke out, China&#x27;s Middle East policy reflected the traditional policy of seeking to maximize its economic interests without becoming entangled in political controversies.

====Pakistan====

Major anti-war demonstrations took place in the cities of Peshawar, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, and Quetta. General Pervez Musharraf faced already fierce opposition from his mostly Muslim population for his support of the U.S. campaign in Afghanistan. Pakistan also had a seat on the UN Security Council during the pre-war period, though would not have likely voted in favour of the resolution at the time Bush had planned to present it, in an attempt to quell civilian dissent.

==== Other Asian states ====
Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia, all largest Muslim countries of world and Vietnam condemned the war. Bangladesh urged to solve the problem through discussion rather than war. Huge anti-war demonstrations took place in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Kathmandu, Nepal; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Kelantan; Jakarta and Java, Indonesia; Surabaya; and Bangkok, Thailand.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand government disagreed with its neighbour, Australia, and did not support the war in principle. However, New Zealand did send a group of non-combatant engineers to help rebuild Iraq. There were major anti-war demonstrations in the New Zealand cities Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland.

== Countries with other positions ==

===Ireland===
Ireland is an officially neutral country, with a strong tradition of supporting UN institutions, peacekeeping and international law. Nevertheless, the use of Shannon Airport was allowed for transatlantic stopovers by the US Army. Under domestic pressure, the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern repeatedly glossed over the particulars of the situation, while emphasising the need for a UN mandate.

Despite large-scale protests, including many at Shannon Airport itself, opinion polls showed that many people broadly supported official policy on the use of the Airport. While a large majority of the public did oppose the war, there was a fifty–fifty split on the use of Shannon. Keeping US investment in Ireland safe was the principal reason for allowing US stopovers. Ultimately anti-war allies were appeased by the government&#x27;s not condoning the war while the situation with Shannon kept Irish-U.S. relations cordial.

=== Iran ===
Iran&#x27;s official view of US policy in Iraq since 2002 has been characterized by considerable ambivalence. On the one hand, lingering mistrust of Saddam Hussein (as a result of 1980–1988 war with Iraq) both created and reinforced an attitude that accepted the US containment of Iraq as being in Iran&#x27;s interests. On the other hand, the US since 1993 had proclaimed the containment of Iran to be of equal importance to that of Iraq, and therefore, Iranian leaders felt encircled by the arrival of thousands of US troops in Iraq together with those in Afghanistan since the end of 2001. Indeed, Bush&#x27;s 2002 inclusion of Iran in his &quot;axis of evil&quot; meant a US military presence in Iraq could constitute an existential threat for the government of the Islamic Republic. As circumstances in Iraq evolved from early 2003 to mid-2005, Iranian policy makers faced the challenge of crafting strategies to take advantage of new opportunities while simultaneously remaining out of the crosshairs of a triumphal and hostile United States.

=== Israel ===

Israel did not support or take part in the Iraq War. According to former State Department official Lawrence Wilkerson and former Central Intelligence Agency official and Iran expert Robert Baer, Israeli officials warned the Bush administration against invading Iraq, saying that it would destabilize the region and empower the much more dangerous regime in Iran. According to former U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith, Israeli officials did not push their American counterparts to initiate the war in Iraq. In an interview with Ynet, Feith stated that &quot;what you heard from the Israelis was not any kind of advocacy of war with Iraq&quot; and that &quot;[w]hat you heard from Israeli officials in private discussions was that they were not really focused on Iraq... [t]hey were much more focused on Iran.&quot;

Nonetheless, Israeli officials expressed concerns about Saddam Hussein. In August 2002, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that Israeli intelligence provided Washington with reports about Iraq&#x27;s alleged program to develop weapons of mass destruction. In the same month, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;Israel is urging United States&#x27; officials not to delay a military strike against Iraq&#x27;s Saddam Hussein&quot;.

In January 2007, &quot;The Forward&quot; reported that, before March 2003, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told Bush that Israel &quot;would not push one way or the other&quot; for or against an Iraq war. According to this report, Sharon said that he believed that Iraq was a genuine threat to the Middle East and had weapons of mass destruction. However, he warned Bush that, if the US did go to war with Iraq, he should make sure to formulate a viable exit strategy, prepare a counterinsurgency strategy, and should not attempt to implant democracy in the Arab world.

After the invasion, Israel shared its expertise on counterinsurgency methods, such as utilizing drones and operating checkpoints.

===Republic of China (Taiwan)===
Despite public protests in front of the American Institute in Taiwan, leaders of the Republic of China (commonly known as Taiwan) seemed supportive of the war effort; however Taiwan did not appear in the official list of members of the Coalition of the Willing. This was because despite the government&#x27;s offer of military and monetary support, Taiwan eventually pulled back from the coalition in response to vocal opposition by opposition leaders and the public at large.

===Solomon Islands===
As Croatia and Slovenia, the Solomon Islands were claimed to be members of the coalition but wished &quot;to disassociate itself from the report&quot;. The Solomon Islands do not have a globally or regionally deployable military.

<doc id="183867" wikidata="Q7098650" url="?curid=183867" title="Opposition to the Iraq War">
<text>Opposition to the Iraq War significantly occurred worldwide, both before and during the initial 2003 invasion of Iraq by a United States–led coalition, and throughout the subsequent occupation. Individuals and groups opposing the war include the governments of many nations which did not take part in the invasion, including both its land neighbors Canada and Mexico, its NATO allies in Europe such as France and Germany, as well as China and Indonesia in Asia, and significant sections of the populace in those that took part in the invasion. Opposition to the war was also widespread domestically.

Rationales for opposition include the belief that the war is illegal according to the United Nations Charter, or would contribute to instability both within Iraq and the wider Middle East. Critics have also questioned the validity of the war&#x27;s stated objectives, such as a supposed link between the country&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist government and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and its possession of weapons of mass destruction &quot;certified&quot; by the Niger uranium forgeries. The latter was claimed by the United States during the run-up to the war, but no such weapons were ever found.

Within the United States, popular opinion on the war has varied significantly with time. Although there was significant opposition to the idea in the months preceding the attack, polls taken during the invasion showed that a majority of US citizens supported their government&#x27;s action. However, public opinion had shifted by 2004 to a majority believing that the invasion was a mistake, and has remained so since then. There has also been significant criticism of the war from US politicians such as Bernie Sanders, national security and military personnel, including generals such as Anthony Zinni and Paul Eaton who served in the war and have since spoken out against its handling, including calling for former Secretary of Defense&#x27;s Donald Rumsfeld resignation. Lieutenant General Gregory S. Newbold, openly critical of Rumsfeld&#x27;s plans for the invasion of Iraq, resigned in protest prior to the invasion.

Worldwide, the war and occupation have been officially condemned by 54 countries and the heads of many major religions. Popular anti-war feeling is strong in these and other countries, including the US&#x27; allies in the conflict, and many have experienced huge protests totalling millions of participants.

==Early opposition==
The opposition to the war manifested itself most visibly in a series of worldwide protests against the Iraq War during February 2003, just before the invasion of Iraq starting on March 20, 2003. Noam Chomsky said:

==Reasons for opposition==
Critics of the invasion claimed that it would lead collateral damage to deaths of thousands of Iraqi civilians and soldiers as well as Coalition soldiers, and that it would moreover damage peace and stability throughout the region and the world.

Another oft-stated reason for opposition is the Westphalian concept that foreign governments should never possess a right to intervene in another sovereign nation&#x27;s internal affairs (including terrorism or any other non-international affair). Giorgio Agamben, the Italian philosopher, has also offered a critique of the logic of preemptive war.

Others did accept a limited right for military intervention in foreign countries, but nevertheless opposed the invasion on the basis that it was conducted without United Nations&#x27; approval and was hence a violation of international law. According to this position, adherence by the United States and the other great powers to the UN Charter and to other international treaties is a legal obligation; exercising military power in violation of the UN Charter undermines the rule of law and is illegal vigilantism on an international scale.

There was also skepticism of U.S. claims that Iraq&#x27;s secular government had any links to Al-Qaeda, the Islamic fundamentalist terrorist group considered responsible for the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

Some expressed puzzlement that the United States would consider military action against Iraq and not against North Korea, which claimed it already had nuclear weapons and had announced that it was willing to contemplate war with the United States. This criticism intensified when North Korea reportedly conducted a nuclear weapons test on October 9, 2006.

There was also criticism of Coalition policy by those who did not believe that military actions would help to fight terror, with some believing that it would actually help Al-Qaeda&#x27;s recruitment efforts; others believed that the war and immediate post-war period would lead to a greatly increased risk that weapons of mass destruction would fall into the wrong hands (including Al-Qaeda).

Both inside and outside of the U.S., some argued that the Bush Administration&#x27;s rationale for war was to gain control over Iraqi natural resources (primarily petroleum). These critics felt that the war would not help to reduce the threat of WMD proliferation, and that the real reason for the war was to secure control over the Iraqi oil fields at a time when US links with Saudi Arabia were seen to be at risk. &quot;No blood for oil&quot; was a popular protest cry prior to the invasion in March 2003. Administration officials denied these charges, and scholar Jeff Colgan writes that &quot;there is still no consensus on the degree to which oil played a role&quot; in the Iraq War.

Some opponents of the war also believed that there would be no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and thus there was little reason for an invasion. Prominent among these was Scott Ritter, a former U.S. military intelligence officer and then a United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq, and who in 1998 had been hawkish enough toward Iraq as to be admonished by U.S. senator Joe Biden, &quot;The decision of whether or not the country should go to war is slightly above your pay grade.&quot; Investigations after the invasion failed to produce evidence of WMDs in Iraq (apart from a very small number of degraded chemical weapons shells located after the Iran–Iraq War ended in 1988). Generally, however, very few opponents of the Iraq invasion publicly expressed doubt as to whether the Saddam Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction.

During the occupation, some opponents accused President Bush of being indifferent to the suffering caused by the invasion. In 2006 for example he opined that when the history of Iraq is written the period would &quot;look like just a comma&quot;, prompting criticism that he took the more than 2,700 US troop deaths lightly.

The Iraq War was met with considerable popular opposition in the United States, beginning during the planning stages and continuing through the invasion subsequent occupation of Iraq. The months leading up to the war saw protests across the United States, the largest of which, held on February 15, 2003 involved about 300,000 to 400,000 protesters in New York City, with smaller numbers protesting in Seattle, San Francisco, Chicago, and other cities.

Consistent with the anti-war sentiment of the protests, in the months leading up to the Iraq War, American public opinion heavily favored a diplomatic solution over immediate military intervention. A January 2003 CBS News/New York Times poll found that 63% of Americans wanted President Bush to find a diplomatic solution to the Iraq situation, compared with 31% who favored immediate military intervention. That poll also found, however, that if diplomacy failed, support for military action to remove Saddam Hussein was above 60 percent.

Days before the March 20 invasion, a &quot;USA Today&quot;/CNN/Gallup Poll found support for the war was related to UN approval. Nearly six in 10 said they were ready for such an invasion &quot;in the next week or two.&quot; But that support dropped off if the U.N. backing was not first obtained. If the U.N. Security Council were to reject a resolution paving the way for military action, only 54% of Americans favored a U.S. invasion. And if the Bush administration did not seek a final Security Council vote, support for a war dropped to 47%.

Immediately after the 2003 invasion most polls within the United States showed a substantial majority of Americans supporting war. In a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans supported military action against Iraq, but that trend began to shift less than a year after the war began. Beginning in December 2004, polls have consistently shown that a majority thinks the invasion was a mistake. As of 2006, opinion on what the U.S. should do in Iraq is split, with a slight majority generally favoring setting a timetable for withdrawal, but against withdrawing immediately. However, in this area responses vary widely with the exact wording of the question.

After the invasion of Iraq, one of the most visible leaders of popular opposition in the U.S. was Cindy Sheehan, the mother of Casey Sheehan, a soldier killed in Iraq. Sheehan&#x27;s role as an anti-war leader began with her camping out near President Bush&#x27;s ranch in Crawford, Texas, and continued with a nationwide tour and trips to Europe and South America.

===Opposition from national security and military personnel===
Several prominent members of the military and national security communities, particularly those who favor a more realist approach to international relations, have been critical of both the decision to invade Iraq and the prosecution of the War.

On July 28, 2002, less than eight months before the invasion of Iraq,&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;many senior U.S. military officers&quot; including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opposed an invasion on the grounds that the policy of containment was working.

A few days later, Gen. Joseph P. Hoar (Ret.) warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the invasion was risky and perhaps unnecessary.

Morton Halperin, a foreign policy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations and Center for American Progress warned that an invasion would increase the terrorist threat.

In a 2002 book, Scott Ritter, a Nuclear Weapons Inspector in Iraq from 1991 to 1998, argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the Bush Administration&#x27;s claims that Saddam Hussein had a WMD capability. He later accused the Bush administration of deliberately misleading the public.

I think [The Bush Administration] has stated that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that&#x27;s as simple as they want to keep it. They don&#x27;t want to get into the nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do you make this stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you disassemble it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that&#x27;s detectable, and they haven&#x27;t done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has an operational weapons of mass destruction capability.

Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Adviser to President George H. W. Bush was an early critic. He wrote an August 15, 2002 editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t attack Saddam,&quot; arguing that the war would distract from the broader fight against terrorism and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which should be the U.S.&#x27;s highest priority in the Middle East. The next month, Gen. Hugh Shelton, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, agreed that war in Iraq would distract from the War on Terrorism.

Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department&#x27;s envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, echoed many of Scowcroft&#x27;s concerns in an October 2002 speech at the Middle East Institute. In a follow-up interview with Salon, Zinni said he was &quot;not convinced we need to do this now,&quot; arguing that deposing Saddam Hussein was only the sixth or seventh top priority in the Middle East, behind the Middle East peace process, reforming Iran, our commitments in Afghanistan, and several others.

By January 19, 2003, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that &quot;as many as 1 in 3 senior officers questions the wisdom of a preemptive war with Iraq.&quot;

On February 13, 2003, Ambassador Joseph Wilson, former chargé d&#x27;affaires in Baghdad, resigned from the Foreign Service and publicly questioned the need for another war in Iraq. After the War started, he wrote an editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; titled &quot;What I Didn&#x27;t Find in Africa&quot; that claimed to discredit a Bush Administration claim that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium from Niger.

John Brady Kiesling, another career diplomat with similar reservations, resigned in a public letter in the &quot;New York Times&quot; on February 27. He was followed on March 10 by John H. Brown, a career diplomat with 22 years of service, and on March 19 by Mary Ann Wright, a diplomat with 15 years of service in the State Department following a military career of 29 years. The war started the next day.

Prominent diplomat George Kennan, who famously advocated the policy of containment of Soviet expansion during the Cold War warned of the unforeseen consequences of waging war against Iraq, a war that &quot;bears no relation to the first war against terrorism&quot; and declared efforts by the Bush administration to associate Al-Qaeda with Saddam Hussein &quot;pathetically unsupportive and unreliable&quot;. Kennan stated:

Anyone who has ever studied the history of American diplomacy, especially military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose of what you are doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before  ... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.

Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski (Ret.) was political/military desk officer at the Defense Department&#x27;s office for Near East South Asia (NESA) in the months before the war. In December 2003 she began to write an anonymous column that described the disrupting influence of the Office of Special Plans on the analysis that led to the decision to go to war.

On June 16, 2004, twenty seven former senior U.S. diplomats and military commanders called Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change issued a statement against the war. The group included:
* William J. Crowe, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Ronald Reagan
* Joseph Hoar, former Commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East
* H. Allen Holmes, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations
* Donald McHenry, former Ambassador to the United Nations
* Merrill McPeak, former Air Force Chief of Staff
* Jack F. Matlock Jr., a member of the National Security Council under Reagan and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union
* John Reinhardt, former director of the United States Information Agency
* Ronald I. Spiers, Under Secretary General of the United Nations for Political Affairs and a former Ambassador
* Stansfield Turner, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency

Richard Clarke, former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council for both the latter part of the Clinton Administration and early part of the George W. Bush Administration, criticized the Iraq War along similar lines in his 2004 book &quot;Against All Enemies&quot; and during his testimony before the 9/11 Commission. In addition to diverting funds from the fight against al-Qaeda, Clarke argued that the invasion of Iraq would actually bolster the efforts of Osama bin Laden and other Islamic radicals, who had long predicted that the U.S. planned to invade an oil-rich Middle Eastern country.

Similar arguments were made in a May 2004 interview and an August 2005 article by Lt. Gen. William Odom, former director of the National Security Agency.

In April 2006, six prominent retired generals publicly criticized Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s handling of the war, and called for his resignation. The group included two generals who commanded troops in Iraq: Maj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr. (Ret.) and Maj. Gen. John Batiste (Ret.). One of the generals, Lieut. Gen. Greg Newbold (Ret.), who served as the Pentagon&#x27;s top operations officer during the months leading up to the invasion, also published an article that month in Time Magazine entitled &quot;Why Iraq Was a Mistake.&quot;

On September 12, 2007, two retired U.S. Army generals, Lt. Gen. Robert Gard and Brig. Gen. John Johns, joined former Sen. Gary Hart in publishing a statement calling for withdrawal from Iraq. Robert Gard is the Senior Military Fellow at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, John Johns is on the board of directors for the Council for a Livable World, and Gary Hart is the council&#x27;s chairman.

In October 2007, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, called the 2007 &quot;surge&quot; a &quot;flawed strategy&quot;, and suggested that the political leadership in the US would have been court martialed for their actions, had they been military personnel.

===Opposition from soldiers===
There have been several individual refusals to ship (e.g., Pablo Paredes, and 1st Lt. Ehren Watada) or to carry out missions (e.g. 343rd Quartermasters). Soon after the war began, 67% of surveyed US soldiers in Iraq told &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; that the invasion was worthwhile, though half described their units&#x27; morale as &quot;low.&quot; A Zogby poll in March 2006 found that 72% of US soldiers in Iraq said the war should be ended within a year, and a quarter said that all troops should be withdrawn immediately.

Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW) was formed in 2004 to help antiwar soldiers network and seek solidarity from one another. IVAW held a Winter Soldier event, from March 13 through March 16, 2008, in which U.S. veterans spoke of their experiences during the Iraq War. The Pacifica Radio network broadcast the proceedings live, and streaming audio and video of the event is also available. John Bonifaz filed a suit on behalf of 12 Congress members and various military families to try to stop the Iraq War.

Using the example of GI resistance coffee housed during the Vietnam War some Iraq War veterans have founded anti-war coffeehouses near military bases to act as resources for soldiers opposed to the Iraq War. Two examples are Under the Hood Café near Fort Hood and Coffee Strong near Joint Base Lewis–McChord.

===Congressional opposition===


Opinion in the U.S. Congress leading up to the Iraq War generally favored a diplomatic solution, while supporting military intervention should diplomacy fail. The October 11, 2002 resolution that authorized President Bush to use force in Iraq passed the Senate by a vote of 77 to 23, and the House by 296 to 133. Leading opponents of the resolution included Senators Russ Feingold and Edward Kennedy.

As the war progressed and the insurgency began to develop into what many believe is a civil war in Iraq, Congressional support for the Iraq campaign began to wane. A flashpoint came on November 17, 2005, when Representative John Murtha, a Vietnam combat veteran who voted to authorize the war and is widely regarded as an ardent supporter of the military, introduced a resolution calling for U.S. forces in Iraq to be &quot;redeployed at the earliest practicable date&quot; to stand as a quick-reaction force in U.S. bases in neighboring countries such as Kuwait.

Since the introduction of the Murtha resolution, many members of Congress, particularly in the Democratic Party, have rallied around the strategy of a phased troop withdrawal. In the 2007 Congressional session, critics of the war have sought to tie additional war appropriations to a specific timetable for withdrawal. On March 23, 2007, the House of Representatives passed an Iraq spending bill that requires that troops begin withdrawing in March 2008 and that most US forces be out of Iraq by August 31, 2008.

Congressional critics of the war have also opposed President Bush&#x27;s plan to send an additional 20,000 U.S. soldiers to Iraq. On January 10, 2007, Senator Dick Durbin gave the Democratic response to this plan by saying: &quot;We have given the Iraqis so much. ... Now, in the fourth year of this war, it is time for the Iraqis to stand and defend their own nation.&quot;

===Opposition from presidential candidates===
The Iraq War was the defining issue of the 2004 U.S. presidential campaign. All of the Republican candidates and most of the Democratic candidates supported the war, although most of the Democrats also criticized the war&#x27;s prosecution.

John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for President in 2004, voted to authorize the invasion, and said during his campaign that he stood by his vote. He also argued during the campaign that &quot;the way he (President Bush) went to war was a mistake.&quot;

In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, candidates Representatives Ron Paul and Dennis Kucinich, Senators Barack Obama, Chris Dodd and Mike Gravel were some of the most outspoken critics of the Iraq War. Ron Paul said that &quot;The war in Iraq was sold to us with false information. The area is more dangerous now than when we entered it. We destroyed a regime hated by our direct enemies, the jihadists, and created thousands of new recruits for them. This war has cost more than 3,000 American lives, thousands of seriously wounded, and hundreds of billions of dollars.&quot; Barack Obama (who went on to win the election) was not a senator at the time of the voting of the Iraq War Resolution, but had repeatedly voiced his disapproval of it both before and during his senatorship, saying at an anti war rally in Chicago on October 2, 2002: &quot;I am not opposed to all wars. I&#x27;m opposed to dumb wars.&quot; He also spoke of the &quot;undetermined length ... undetermined cost, [and] undetermined consequences&quot; which even a successful war would bring. Dodd voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002, but Dodd has since become an opponent of the war. Dodd has said the Iraq War has been waged &quot;for all the wrong reasons&quot; and that it is eroding both the nation&#x27;s security and its moral leadership.

===Opposition from lawyers specializing in international law===
Investigator of Nazi war crimes Ben Ferencz has suggested in an interview given on August 25, 2006, that not only Saddam Hussein should be tried in the International Criminal Court, but also George W. Bush because the Iraq War had been begun by the U.S. without permission by the UN Security Council. Ben Ferencz wrote the foreword for political analyst Michael Haas&#x27;s book, talking about possible indictment of Bush administration over war crime charges, titled &quot;George W. Bush, War Criminal?: The Bush Administration&#x27;s Liability for 269 War Crimes&quot;.

==Opposition in European countries==
Around the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation of Iraq, polling data indicated that opposition to military action against Iraq was widespread in Europe.

&#x27;Anti-Bush&#x27; and anti-war sentiments were reflected in many western European countries, generally with the populace less sympathetic to the U.S. stance even when the government in a given country (e.g. the United Kingdom, or Italy) aligned themselves with the U.S. position. Opinion polls showed the population was against the war, with opposition as high as 90% in Spain and Italy, and also widespread in Eastern Europe. Some suggested that the reason for the EU&#x27;s negative view of the war are Europe&#x27;s economic interests in the region. However, the electorates of France and Germany were strongly opposed to the war and it would have been difficult for their governments to fail to reflect these views.

After the first UN resolution, the US and the UK pushed for a second resolution authorizing an invasion. The French and German governments, amongst others, took the position that the UN inspection process should be allowed to be completed. France&#x27;s then-Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin received loud applause for his speech against the Iraq War at the United Nations on February 14, 2003. Neither of these countries have sent troops to Iraq. However, despite popular opinion in their countries, the governments of Italy and Spain supported the war politically and militarily, although Spain ceased to do so after the election of a Socialist government in 2004.

In the United Kingdom, both the governing Labour Party and the official opposition Conservative Party were in favour of the invasion. The Liberal Democrats insisted on a U.N. resolution; they opposed the war as a result. Outside parliament, anti-war sentiment was more widespread: the February 15, 2003 protest in London attracted between 750,000 and 2,000,000 supporters from various walks of life. Prominent politicians and other individuals expressing anti-war views included: Tory MP Ken Clarke, Charles Kennedy, Menzies Campbell, Tony Benn, George Galloway, future Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, Chris Martin, Damon Albarn, Ms. Dynamite, and Bianca Jagger.

Two prominent Labour politicians resigned from their positions in opposition to the war. Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook resigned from the Cabinet two days before the start of the invasion on 17 March. In a statement giving his reasons for resigning he said:

Our interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules. Yet tonight the international partnerships most important to us are weakened: the European Union is divided; the Security Council is in stalemate. Those are heavy casualties of a war in which a shot has yet to be fired.&quot; and &quot;The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner—not NATO, not the European Union and, now, not the Security Council.&quot;

Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short supported the government&#x27;s resolution in the House of Commons and remained in the Cabinet for two months but eventually resigned on 12 May.

Deputy FCO Legal Adviser Elizabeth Wilmshurst resigned on 20 March 2003, three days after Lord Goldsmith&#x27;s final advice to the British government reversed her legal opinion (in Lord Goldsmith&#x27;s first secret memo 10 days earlier) that the invasion was illegal without a second United Nations Security Council Resolution to SCR 678.

==Opposition throughout the world==

Opinion polls showed that the population of nearly all countries opposed a war without UN mandate, and that the view of the United States as a danger to world peace had significantly increased. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the war as illegal, saying in a September 2004 interview that it was &quot;not in conformity with the Security Council.&quot;

Nelson Mandela, former President of South Africa, called the US&#x27;s attitude five months before the invasion a &quot;threat to world peace&quot;. He said they were sending a message that &quot;if you are afraid of a veto in the Security Council, you can go outside and take action and violate the sovereignty of other countries&quot;; a message which &quot;must be condemned in the strongest terms.&quot;

==Religious opposition==
On September 13, 2002, US Catholic bishops signed a letter to President Bush stating that any &quot;preemptive, unilateral use of military force to overthrow the government of Iraq&quot; could not be justified at the time. They came to this position by evaluating whether an attack against Iraq would satisfy the criteria for a just war as defined by Catholic theology.

US civil-rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson condemned the planned invasion, saying in February 2003 that it was not too late to stop the war and that people &quot;must march until there is a declaration of peace and reconciliation.&quot;

The Vatican also spoke out against war in Iraq. Archbishop Renato Martino, a former U.N. envoy and current prefect of the Council for Justice and Peace, told reporters that war against Iraq was a preventive war and constituted a &quot;war of aggression&quot;, and thus did not constitute a just war. The foreign minister, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, expressed concerns that a war in Iraq would inflame anti-Christian feelings in the Islamic world. On February 8, 2003, Pope John Paul II said &quot;we should never resign ourselves, almost as if war is inevitable.&quot; He spoke out again on March 22, 2003, shortly after the invasion began, saying that violence and arms &quot;can never resolve the problems of man.&quot;

Both the outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and his successor, Rowan Williams, spoke out against war with Iraq.

The executive committee of the World Council of Churches, an organization representing churches with a combined membership of between 350 million and 450 million Christians from over 100 countries, issued a statement in opposition to war with Iraq, stating that &quot;War against Iraq would be immoral, unwise, and in breach of the principles of the United Nations Charter.&quot;

Jim Wallis of &quot;Sojourners Magazine&quot; has argued that, among both evangelical Christians and Catholics, &quot;most major church bodies around the world&quot; opposed the war. Raëlians also protested the war, organizing demonstrations in which they held signs saying &quot;NO WAR ... ET wants Peace, too!&quot;

==Opposition by notable non-governmental figures==
In the lead-up to the invasion, a project by Talking Heads frontman David Byrne and comedian Russell Simmons was formed which was called &quot;Musicians United to Win Without War.&quot;
The artists who had their names involved in this are listed below:

==Protests against the Iraq War==
Across the world popular opposition to the Iraq war has led to thousands of protests since 2002, against the invasion of Iraq. They were held in many cities worldwide, often co-ordinated to occur simultaneously worldwide. After the simultaneous demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, the largest in total turnout, &quot;New York Times&quot; writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and world public opinion. As the war drew nearer, other groups held candlelight vigils and students walked out of school.

The February 15, 2003, worldwide protests drew millions of people across the world. It is generally estimated that over 3 million people marched in Rome, between one and two million in London, more than 600,000 in Madrid, 300,000 in Berlin, as well as in Damascus, Paris, New York, Oslo, Stockholm, Brussels, Johannesburg, Montreal—more than 600 cities in all, worldwide. This demonstration was listed in the 2004 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the largest mass protest movement in history.

==Support for Iraqi resistance and insurgency==
There has been a debate among those opposed to the U.S. invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq in developed countries about how to relate to forces within Iraq. It is possible that Iraq paid the US in dinars for their efforts in the war.

Prior to the invasion, while it was common to accuse opponents of providing objective, if not intentional, support to Saddam, none of the major antiwar organizations declared any support for him, however limited. After the invasion and the toppling of Saddam&#x27;s regime, some who had opposed it now supported continuing U.S. occupation, arguing that the U.S.&#x27;s intervention had given it an obligation to stabilize the country. However, those who remained opposed to the U.S. presence had to determine their approach to the developing armed insurgency and peaceful opposition to the occupation carried out by groups like the Worker-communist Party of Iraq (WCPI).

The most virulent divide has been about whether to support the insurgency. Of the major Western antiwar organizations, United for Peace and Justice has never supported the insurgency, but Act Now to Stop War and End Racism and the Stop the War Coalition have a more ambivalent stance on this subject. Of the smaller groups which participate in these coalitions, none support suicide bombings of Iraqi civilians, but some support violence against coalition soldiers.

At a 2004 conference in Japan, Eric Ruder, of the U.S.-based International Socialist Organization, presented a case for supporting the guerrillas. Citing the primarily decentralized and domestic nature of the insurgency, the fact that a clear majority of attacks are directed against U.S. and British forces, and he also claimed there was widespread Iraqi support for violent insurgency, Ruder argues that the insurgents&#x27; cause and methods are, on the whole, just and deserve support. He claims that the Iraqi right to self-determination precludes Western opponents of the occupation placing conditions on their support of the Iraqi resistance, and argues that &quot;If the Iraqi resistance drives the U.S. out of Iraq, it would be a major setback for Bush&#x27;s agenda and the agenda of the U.S. imperialism. This would be a tremendous victory for our side—making it much more difficult for the U.S. to choose a new target in the Middle East or elsewhere in trying to impose its will.&quot;

Sato Kazuyoshi, President of the Japanese Movement for Democratic Socialism, argues otherwise. Reporting on the discussion at the 2004 conference, he writes that, &quot;We cannot support, nor extend our solidarity to, them on the grounds that their strategy excludes many Iraqi citizens—above all, women—and do great harm on the civilians, and will bring the Iraqi future society under an Islamic dictatorship.&quot; He cites in turn Mahmood Ketabchi of the WCPI, who criticizes Iraqi guerrilla groups for Baathist and Islamist connections, and attacks Ruder&#x27;s view as a &quot;Left Nationalism&quot; which ignores divisions within Iraq. Countering the response that the best way to ensure that progressive forces, not reactionary ones, dominate post-occupation Iraq would be for progressives to take the lead in fighting the occupation, Ketabchi argues that this is not possible due to the present situation in Iraq. Nevertheless, he claims, &quot;We do not have to choose between the US and Iraqi reactionary forces. Opposition to the US is not a progressive stand per se. What matters is the kind of future that this opposition represents and objectives it pursues.&quot; A third alternative is represented by what Kazuyoshi calls the &quot;Civil Resistance.&quot;

The 55 following countries and unions have protested formally and officially the prosecution of this war. They oppose the Iraq War in principle, citing in some cases that they believe it is illegal, and in others that it required a United Nations mandate.

==Quotations==
* &quot;The option of war can appear initially to be the most rapid. But let us not forget that after winning the war, peace must be built.&quot; – Dominique de Villepin, French Foreign Minister, at the United Nations Security Council on February 14, 2003
* &quot;To a certain extent Saddam Hussein&#x27;s departure was a positive thing. But it also provoked reactions, such as the mobilization in a number of countries, of men and women of Islam, which has made the world more dangerous.&quot; – French President Jacques Chirac, November 17, 2004
* &quot;Make no mistake about it, the ultimate aim that the Bush and Blair regimes have embarked upon is nothing less than &#x27;universal or world domination.&#x27; Iraq is merely a stepping stone along the way.&quot;– David Comissiong (Barbadian Politician)
* &quot;Iraq was not involved in 9-11, Iraq was not a terrorist state. But now that we have decimated the country, the borders are open, freedom fighters from other countries are going in and they have created more terrorism by going to an Islamic country, devastating the country and killing innocent people in that country.&quot; – Cindy Sheehan (American anti-war activist), Interview with CBS News&#x27; Mark Knoller, upon her arrival in Crawford, Texas on August 6, 2005

<text>Land Force Western Area (LFWA) was a formation of the Canadian Army responsible for operations in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. LFWA was headquartered at CFB Edmonton. The command was formed in 1991. In 2013 it was announced that LFWA would be renamed 3rd Canadian Division. This change took place in the summer of 2014.

==History==
LFWA was created on 1 September 1991, taking command of what was previously Prairie Militia Area, Pacific Militia Area, and the Regular Force Army units and formations in western Canada from the northern lakehead region of Ontario to the Pacific Ocean. At that point in time, the Militia Areas ceased to exist, and the seven subordinate Militia Districts were reorganised into four: British Columbia District, Alberta District, Saskatchewan District, and Manitoba-Lakehead District.

Later that decade, the four reserve force districts were again reorganized into three Canadian Brigade Groups.

In 2014 LFWA was renamed 3rd Canadian Division. With this change of name, the formation was also granted the identifying patch and historical lineage to the division that fought in the two world wars.

*Brigadier-General P.F. Wynnyk, OMM, CD (2010–2012)
*Brigadier-General J.C.G. Juneau (2012–2014)

==Units==
Land Force Western Area had four brigade groups (one Regular Force and three Reserve Force), and an Area Support Group.

There were also five units are under direct command of LFWA that did not operate under the brigade or area support groups. They were:
* Land Force Western Area Headquarters – (CFB Edmonton)
* 6 Intelligence Company

* 4th Canadian Ranger Patrol Group – (Group HQ in Victoria, BC. Ranger Company HQs in Victoria, Edmonton and Winnipeg, plus Junior Canadian Ranger Company HQ also in Victoria. 42 Canadian Ranger Patrols (platoon size) across the four western provinces)
