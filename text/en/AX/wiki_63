<text>Nelson Algren (born Nelson Ahlgren Abraham; March 28, 1909 – May 9, 1981) was an American writer. His 1949 novel &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; won the National Book Award and was adapted as the 1955 film of the same name.

Algren articulated the world of &quot;drunks, pimps, prostitutes, freaks, drug addicts, prize fighters, corrupt politicians, and hoodlums&quot;. Art Shay singled out a poem Algren wrote from the perspective of a &quot;halfy,&quot; street slang for a legless man on wheels. Shay said that Algren considered this poem to be a key to everything he had ever written. The protagonist talks about &quot;how forty wheels rolled over his legs and how he was ready to strap up and give death a wrestle.&quot;

According to Harold Augenbraum, &quot;in the late 1940s and early 1950s he was one of the best known literary writers in America.&quot; The lover of French writer Simone de Beauvoir, he is featured in her novel &quot;The Mandarins&quot;, set in Paris and Chicago. He was called &quot;a sort of bard of the down-and-outer&quot; based on this book, but also on his short stories in &quot;The Neon Wilderness&quot; (1947) and his novel &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1956). The latter was adapted as the 1962 film of the same name (directed by Edward Dmytryk, screenplay by John Fante).

==Life==
Algren was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Goldie (née Kalisher) and Gerson Abraham. At the age of three, he moved with his parents to Chicago, Illinois, where they lived in a working-class, immigrant neighborhood on the South Side. His father was the son of a Swedish convert to Judaism and of a German Jewish woman, and his mother was of German Jewish descent. (She owned a candy store on the South Side.) When he was young, Algren&#x27;s family lived at 7139 S. South Park Avenue (now S. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) in the Greater Grand Crossing section of the South Side.

When he was eight, his family moved from the far South Side to an apartment at 4834 N. Troy Street, in the North Side neighborhood of Albany Park. His father worked as an auto mechanic nearby on North Kedzie Avenue.

In his essay &quot;&quot;, Algren added autobiographical details: he recalled being teased by neighborhood children after moving to Troy Street because he was a fan of the South Side White Sox. Despite living most of his life on the North Side, Algren never changed his affiliation and remained a White Sox fan.

Algren was educated in Chicago&#x27;s public schools, graduated from Hibbard High School (now Roosevelt High School) and went on to study at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in journalism during the Great Depression in 1931. During his time at the University of Illinois, he wrote for the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; student newspaper.

===Literary career and marriage===
Algren wrote his first story, &quot;So Help Me&quot;, in 1933, while he was in Texas working at a gas station. Before returning to Chicago, he was caught stealing a typewriter from an empty classroom at Sul Ross State University in Alpine. He boarded a train for his getaway but was apprehended and returned to Alpine. He was held in jail for nearly five months and faced a possible additional three years in prison. He was released, but the incident made a deep impression on him. It deepened his identification with outsiders, has-beens, and the general failures who later populated his fictional world.

In 1935 Algren won the first of his three O. Henry Awards for his short story, &quot;The Brother&#x27;s House.&quot; The story was first published in &quot;Story&quot; magazine and was reprinted in an anthology of O. Henry Award winners.

His first novel, &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot; (1935), was later dismissed by Algren as primitive and politically naive, claiming he infused it with Marxist ideas he little understood, because they were fashionable at the time. The book was unsuccessful and went out of print.
Algren married Amanda Kontowicz in 1937. He had met her at a party celebrating the publication of &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot;. They eventually would divorce and remarry before divorcing a second and final time.

His second novel, &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; (1942), was described by Andrew O&#x27;Hagan in 2019 as &quot;the book that really shows the Algren style in its first great flourishing.&quot; It portrays the dead-end life of a doomed young Polish-American boxer turned criminal. Ernest Hemingway, in a July 8, 1942, letter to his publisher Maxwell Perkins, said of the novel: &quot;I think it very, very good. It is as fine and good stuff to come out of Chicago.&quot; The novel offended members of Chicago&#x27;s large Polish-American community, some of whose members denounced it as pro-Axis propaganda. Not knowing that Algren was of partly Jewish descent, some incensed Polish-American Chicagoans said he was pro-Nazi Nordic. His Polish-American critics persuaded Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly to ban the novel from the Chicago Public Library.

===Military service===
Algren served as a private in the European Theater of World War II as a litter bearer. Despite being a college graduate, he was denied entry into Officer Candidate School. There is conjecture that it may have been due to suspicion regarding his political beliefs, but his criminal conviction would have most likely excluded him from OCS.

According to Bettina Drew in her 1989 biography &quot;Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side&quot;, Algren had no desire to serve in the war but was drafted in 1943. An indifferent soldier, he dealt on the black market while he was stationed in France. He received a bad beating by some fellow black marketeers.

===Fame===
Algren&#x27;s first short-story collection, &quot;The Neon Wilderness&quot; (1947), collected 24 stories from 1933 to 1947. The same year, Algren received an award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a grant from Chicago&#x27;s Newberry Library.

It was in that same year that Algren had an affair with Simone de Beauvoir. Mary Guggenheim, who had been Algren&#x27;s lover, recommended De Beauvoir visit Algren in Chicago. The couple would summer together in Algren&#x27;s cottage in the lake front community of Miller Beach, Indiana, and also travel to Latin America together in 1949. In her novel &quot;The Mandarins&quot; (1954), Beauvoir wrote of Algren (who is &#x27;Lewis Brogan&#x27; in the book):

At first I found it amusing meeting in the flesh that classic American species: self-made leftist writer. Now, I began taking an interest in Brogan. Through his stories, you got the feeling that he claimed no rights to life and that nevertheless he had always had a passionate desire to live. I liked that mixture of modesty and eagerness.

Algren and Beauvoir eventually became disenchanted with each other, and a bitter Algren wrote of Beauvoir and Sartre in a &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine article about a trip he took to North Africa with Beauvoir, that she and Sartre were bigger users of others than a prostitute and her pimp in their way.

Algren&#x27;s next novel, &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1949), would become his best known work. It won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1950. The protagonist of the book, Frankie Machine, is an aspiring drummer who is a dealer in illicit card games. Frankie is trapped in demimonde Chicago, having picked up a morphine habit during his brief military service during World War II. He is married to a woman whom he mistakenly believes became crippled in a car accident he caused.

Algren&#x27;s next book, &quot;&quot; (1951), was a scathing essay that outraged the city&#x27;s boosters but portrayed the back alleys of the city, its dispossessed, its corrupt politicians and its swindlers. Algren also declared his love of the City as a &quot;lovely so real&quot;.

&quot;The Man With the Golden Arm&quot; was adapted as a 1955 movie of the same name, starring Frank Sinatra and directed and produced by Otto Preminger. Algren soon withdrew from direct involvement. It was a commercial success but Algren loathed the film. He sued Preminger seeking an injunction to stop him from claiming ownership of the property as &quot;An Otto Preminger film&quot;, but he soon withdrew his suit for financial reasons.

In the fall of 1955, Algren was interviewed for &quot;The Paris Review&quot; by rising author Terry Southern. Algren and Southern became friends through this meeting and remained in touch for many years. Algren became one of Southern&#x27;s most enthusiastic early supporters and, when he taught creative writing in later years, he often used Southern as an example of a great short story writer.

Algren had another commercial success with the novel &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1956). He reworked some of the material from his first novel, &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot;, as well as picking up elements from several published short stories, such as his 1947 &quot;The Face on the Barroom Floor&quot;. The novel was about a wandering Texan adrift during the early years of the Great Depression. He said it was superior to the earlier book. It was adapted as the 1962 movie of the same name. Some critics thought the film bowdlerized the book, and it was not commercially successful.

===Decline and second marriage===
&quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot; was Algren&#x27;s last commercial success. He turned to teaching creative writing at the University of Iowa&#x27;s Writers Workshop to supplement his income.

In 1965, he met Betty Ann Jones while teaching at the Writers Workshop. They married that year and divorced in 1967. According to Kurt Vonnegut, who taught with him at Iowa in 1965, Algren&#x27;s &quot;enthusiasm for writing, reading and gambling left little time for the duties of a married man.&quot;

Algren played a small part in Philip Kaufman&#x27;s underground comedy &quot;Fearless Frank&quot; (1967) as a mobster named Needles.

In 1968, he signed the Writers and Editors War Tax Protest pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

According to Bettina Drew&#x27;s biography, Algren angled for a journalism job in South Vietnam. Strapped for cash more than a decade after his only two commercially successful novels, he saw Vietnam as an opportunity to make money, not from journalism fees but dealing on the black market.

===Hurricane Carter and Paterson, New Jersey===
In 1975, Algren was commissioned to write a magazine article about the trial of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, the prize fighter who had been found guilty of double murder. While researching the article, Algren visited Carter&#x27;s hometown of Paterson, New Jersey. Algren was instantly fascinated by the city of Paterson and he immediately decided to move there. In the summer of 1975, Algren sold off most of his belongings, left Chicago, and moved into an apartment in Paterson.

===Death===
In 1980, Algren moved to a house in Sag Harbor, Long Island. He died of a heart attack at home on May 9, 1981. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery, Sag Harbor, Long Island.

==Posthumously published works==
After Algren died, it was discovered that the article about Hurricane Carter had grown into a novel, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Stocking&quot;, which was published posthumously in 1983.

In September 1996, the book &quot;Nonconformity&quot; was published by Seven Stories Press, presenting Algren&#x27;s view of the difficulties surrounding the 1956 film adaptation of &quot;The Man With the Golden Arm&quot;. &quot;Nonconformity&quot; also presents the belief system behind Algren&#x27;s writing and a call to writers everywhere to investigate the dark and represent the ignored. &quot;The Neon Wilderness&quot; and &quot;The Last Carousel&quot; were also reprinted by Seven Stories Press and recognized as the Library Journal Editors&#x27; Best Reprints of 1997.

In 2009, Seven Stories then published &quot;Entrapment and Other Writings&quot;, a major collection of previously unpublished writings that included two early short stories, &quot;Forgive Them, Lord,&quot; and &quot;The Lightless Room,&quot; and the long unfinished novel fragment referenced in the book&#x27;s title. In 2019, Blackstone Audio released the complete library of Algren&#x27;s books as audiobooks. And in 2020 Olive Films released &quot;Nelson Algren Live&quot;, a performance film of Algren&#x27;s life and work starring Willem Dafoe and Barry Gifford, among others, produced by the Seven Stories Institute.

== Political views and FBI surveillance ==
Algren&#x27;s friend Stuart McCarrell described him as a &quot;gut radical,&quot; who generally sided with the downtrodden but was uninterested in ideological debates and politically inactive for most of his life. McCarrell states that Algren&#x27;s heroes were the &quot;prairie radicals&quot; Theodore Dreiser, John Peter Altgeld, Clarence Darrow and Eugene V. Debs. Algren references all of these men – as well as Big Bill Haywood, the Haymarket defendants and the Memorial Day Massacre victims – in &quot;&quot;.

Algren told McCarrell that he never joined the Communist Party, despite its appeal to artists and intellectuals during the Great Depression. Among other reasons, he cited negative experiences both he and Richard Wright had with party members. However, his involvement in groups deemed &quot;subversive&quot; during the McCarthy years drew the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Among his affiliations, he was a participant in the John Reed Club in the 1930s and later an honorary co-chair of the &quot;Save Ethel and Julius Rosenberg Committee&quot; in Chicago. According to Herbert Mitgang, the FBI suspected Algren&#x27;s political views and kept a dossier on him amounting to more than 500 pages but identified nothing concretely subversive.

During the 1950s, Algren wished to travel to Paris with his romantic companion, Simone de Beauvoir, but due to government surveillance his passport applications were denied. When he finally did get a passport in 1960, McCarrell concludes that &quot;it was too late. By then the relationship [with de Beauvoir] had changed subtly but decisively.&quot;

== Algren and Chicago Polonia ==
Algren described Ashland Avenue as figuratively connecting Chicago to Warsaw in Poland. His own life involved the Polish community of Chicago in many ways, including his first wife Amanda Kontowicz. His friend Art Shay wrote about Algren, who while gambling, listened to old Polish love songs sung by an elderly waitress. The city&#x27;s Polish Downtown, where he lived for years, played a significant part in his literary output. Polish bars that Algren frequented in his gambling, such as the Bit of Poland on Milwaukee Avenue, figured in such writings as &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; and &quot;The Man With the Golden Arm&quot;.

His novel &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; was published several years after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, a period when Poles, like Jews, were labeled an inferior race by Nazi ideology. Chicago&#x27;s Polish-American leaders thought &quot;Never Come Morning&quot; played on these anti-Polish stereotypes, and launched a sustained campaign against the book through the Polish press, the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America, and other Polish-American institutions. Articles appeared in the local Polish newspapers and letters were sent to Mayor Ed Kelly, the Chicago Public Library, and Algren&#x27;s publisher, Harper &amp; Brothers. The general tone of the campaign is suggested by a &quot;Zgoda&quot; editorial that attacked his character and mental state, saw readers who got free copies as victims of a Nazi-financed plot, and said the novel proved a deep desire to harm ethnic Poles on Algren&#x27;s part. The Polish American Council sent a copy of a resolution condemning the novel to the FBI. Algren and his publisher defended against these accusations, with the author telling a library meeting that the book was about the effects of poverty, regardless of national background. The mayor had the novel removed from the Chicago Public Library system, and it apparently remained absent for at least 20 years. At least two later efforts to commemorate Algren in Polish Downtown echoed the attacks on the novels.

Shortly after his death in 1981, his last Chicago residence at 1958 West Evergreen Street was noted by Chicago journalist Mike Royko. The walk-up apartment just east of Damen Avenue in the former Polish Downtown neighborhood of West Town was in an area that had been dominated by Polish immigrants and was once one of Chicago&#x27;s toughest and most crowded neighborhoods. The renaming of Evergreen Street to Algren Street caused controversy and was almost immediately reversed.

In 1998, Algren enthusiasts instigated the renaming after Algren of the Polish Triangle in what had been the center of the Polish Downtown. Replacing the plaza&#x27;s traditional name, the director of the Polish Museum of America predicted, would obliterate the history of Chicago ethnic Poles and insult ethnic Polish institutions and local businesses. In the end a compromise was reached where the Triangle kept its older name and a newly installed fountain was named after Algren and inscribed with a quotation about the city&#x27;s working people protecting its essence, from Algren&#x27;s essay &quot;&quot;.

==Hoax broadcast==
A passage featured in Algren&#x27;s book &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Stocking&quot; (1983) was broadcast on TV some six years earlier during the Southern Television hoax in the UK which generated international publicity when students interrupted the regular broadcast through the Hannington transmitter of the Independent Broadcasting Authority for six minutes on November 26, 1977. Issue No. 24 of &quot;Fortean Times&quot; (Winter 1977) transcribed the hoaxer&#x27;s message as:

This is the voice of Asteron. I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission and I have a message for the planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius and there are many corrections which have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to live to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace or leave the galaxy.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Stocking&quot; is Algren&#x27;s fictionalized account of the trial of Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, a real-life prize-fighter who had been found guilty of double murder, about whom Algren had written a magazine article for &quot;Esquire&quot; in 1975. In the book, as a period of unrest within the prison begins, the character &#x27;Kenyatta&#x27; gives a speech closely mirroring the &quot;Fortean Times&quot; transcript of the 1977 hoax, and those of other American newspaper reports of the broadcast. The passage in Algren&#x27;s book says:

I am an authorized representative of the Intergalactic Mission,&quot; Kenyatta finally disclosed his credentials. &quot;I have a message for the Planet Earth. We are beginning to enter the period of Aquarius. Many corrections have to be made by Earth people. All your weapons of evil must be destroyed. You have only a short time to learn to live together in peace. You must live in peace&quot; – here he paused to gain everybody&#x27;s attention – &quot;you must live in peace or leave the galaxy!&quot;

==Honors and awards==
Algren won his first O. Henry Award for his short story &quot;The Brother&#x27;s House&quot; (published in &quot;Story Magazine&quot;) in 1935. His short stories &quot;A Bottle of Milk for Mother (Biceps)&quot; (published in the &quot;Southern Review&quot;) and &quot;The Captain is Impaled&quot; (&quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;) were O. Henry Award winners in 1941 and 1950, respectively. None of the stories won the first, second or third place awards but were included in the annual collection of O. Henry Award stories.

&quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1950.

In 1947 Algren won an Arts and Letters Award from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the forerunner to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1974 the Institute awarded him the Award of Merit Medal for the novel. And three months before he died in 1981, Algren was elected to the Academy of Arts and Letters.

Algren was also honored in 1998 with the Nelson Algren Fountain located in Chicago&#x27;s Polish Triangle, in what had been the heart of Polish Downtown, the area that figured as the inspiration for much of his work. Appropriately enough, Division Street, Algren&#x27;s favorite street as well as the onetime &quot;Polish Broadway&quot;, runs right past it.

In 2010, Algren was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Literary Hall of Fame.

==In popular culture==
===In literature and publications===
*In his 1967 novella, &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot;, Richard Brautigan writes about crating up and mailing a crippled wino (Trout Fishing in America Shorty) to Nelson Algren.
*In 2011, literary publication &quot;3:AM Magazine&quot; named Algren a cult hero.

===In music===
*Leonard Cohen used images from &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; in &quot;The Stranger Song&quot;, from his first album, &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; (1967): &quot;you&#x27;ve seen that man before: his golden arm dispatching cards, but now it&#x27;s rusted from the elbows to the finger.&quot;
*In the documentary &quot;Classic Albums: Lou Reed: Transformer&quot;, musician Lou Reed says that Algren&#x27;s 1956 novel, &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, was the launching point for his similarly-titled 1972 song.
*According to the liner notes of The Tubes&#x27; second album, &quot;Young and Rich&quot; (1976), &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot; is the inspiration for their song &quot;Pimp&quot;.
* The Verve has a song called &quot;Neon Wilderness&quot; on their 1997 album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;.
*The Minnesota-based punk-rock band Dillinger Four quote Algren as an inspiration in the song &quot;Doublewhiskeycokenoice&quot; from their 1998 album &quot;Midwestern Songs of the Americas&quot;. In that song Patrick Costello sings &quot;Nelson Algren came to me and said, &#x27;Celebrate the ugly things&#x27; / The beat-up side of what they call pride could be the measure of these days.&quot;
*The 2002 album &quot;Adult World&quot; by guitarist Wayne Kramer (founding member of the Detroit band MC5) contains a song titled &quot;Nelson Algren Stopped By,&quot; in which guest band X-Mars-X provides a shuffling jazz background while Kramer reads a prose poem about walking the streets of present-day Chicago with Algren.
*In 2005, The Hold Steady mentioned Algren in the song &quot;Chicago Seemed Tired Last Night&quot; from the &quot;Separation Sunday&quot; album. The first line of the song is &quot;Nelson Algren came to Paddy at some party at the Dead End Alley/He told him what to celebrate&quot; and toward the end the song goes &quot;Hey Nelson Algren. Chicago seemed tired last night/They had cigarettes where there were supposed to be eyes.&quot; The name &#x27;Paddy&#x27; in the song is a reference to Patrick Costello and the &#x27;Dead End Alley&#x27; is the name of the house where the Dillinger Four&#x27;s members used to live.
*The Devil Wears Prada on their 2019 album&quot; The Act&quot; has the song &quot;Please Say No&quot; which is based on the novel &quot;Never Come Morning&quot;.

===Onstage===
*In 1988, &quot;A Walk on the Wild Side&quot; was staged as a musical at the Back Alley Theatre in Van Nuys, California. Will Holt, who wrote the book, music, and lyrics, went on to win the Los Angeles Dramalogue Critics Award for his work.
*In 2000, John Susman&#x27;s play &quot;Nelson &amp; Simone&quot; was produced at Chicago&#x27;s Live Bait Theatre, directed by Richard Cotovsky, and starring Gary Houston and Rebecca Covey. The play dramatizes the love affair between Algren and Simone de Beauvoir.

== Nelson Algren Award ==

Each year the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gives a Nelson Algren award for short fiction. Winners are published in the newspaper and given $5,000. The award is viewed with more than a little irony by Algren admirers; the &quot;Tribune&quot; panned Algren&#x27;s work in his lifetime, referring to &quot;Chicago: City on the Make&quot; as &quot;an ugly, highly scented object.&quot; In an afterword to that book, Algren accused the &quot;Tribun&quot;e of imposing false viewpoints on the city and promoting mediocrity.

Studs Terkel, writer Warren Leming, and three others founded the Nelson Algren Committee in 1989. At the time, there was a renewed interest in Algren&#x27;s work. &quot;Somebody in Boots&quot; and &quot;Never Come Morning&quot;, both long out of print, had been republished in 1987. The first biography of Algren, Bettina Drew&#x27;s &quot;Nelson Algren: A Life on the Wild Side&quot;, was published in 1989 by Putnam. All of Nelson Algren&#x27;s words are now back in print.

The Committee awards community activists an annual Algren award and sponsors an Algren birthday party.

<doc id="182242" wikidata="Q488662" url="?curid=182242" title="Sea of Japan naming dispute">
<text>A dispute exists over the international name for the body of water which is bordered by Japan, Korea (North and South) and Russia. In 1992, objections to the name Sea of Japan were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. The Japanese government supports the exclusive use of the name , while South Korea supports the alternative name &quot;East Sea&quot; (), and North Korea supports the name &quot;Korean East Sea&quot; (). Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) by itself, or include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name. The International Hydrographic Organization, the governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided it was still unable to revise the 1953 version of its publication S-23 — Limits of Oceans and Seas, which includes only the single name &quot;Sea of Japan&quot;, to include &quot;East Sea&quot; together with &quot;Sea of Japan&quot;.

The involved countries (especially Japan and South Korea) have advanced a variety of arguments to support their preferred name(s). Many of the arguments revolve around determining when the name Sea of Japan became the common name. South Korea argues that historically the more common name was East Sea, Sea of Korea, or another similar variant. South Korea further argues that the name Sea of Japan did not become common until Korea was under Japanese rule, at which time it had no ability to influence international affairs. Japan argues that the name Sea of Japan has been the most common international name since at least the beginning of the 19th century, long before its annexation of Korea, and it was in use during its period of isolation when Japan had little to no contact with foreign nations. Both sides have conducted studies of antiquarian maps, but the two countries have produced divergent research results. Additional arguments have been raised regarding the underlying geography of the sea as well as potential problems regarding the ambiguity of one name or the other.

==Arguments==
Both sides in the dispute have put forward a number of arguments to support their claims.

===Arguments based on historical maps===

====Arguments from South Korea====
According to South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the name East Sea (Donghae(동해)) can be found in various historical records produced in the span of over 2,000 years, including the &quot;History of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1145), the monument of King Gwanggaeto (414), and &quot;Map of Eight Provinces of Korea&quot; (, 1530). According to such records, the name East Sea is almost 1,700 years older than the first documented world map to name the area the Sea of Japan, the &quot;Kunyu Wanguo Quantu&quot; (坤輿萬國全圖), which was drawn by the Italian missionary Matteo Ricci in China (1602). No Japanese record published up to the late-18th century indicated any name for the body of water. Furthermore, South Korea has pointed out that Japan itself recognized the sea as Sea of Joseon (Korea) not Sea of Japan since some 18th and 19th-century Japanese maps referred to the sea as Chōsenkai (朝鮮海, literally Sea of Joseon), including the , Map of Asia (亞細亞全圖, 1794) which was drawn by Katsuragawa Hoshu (桂川甫周) and the . Additionally, it specifically states that the name Sea of Japan was not widely used, even in Japan, as late as the mid 19th century. Moreover, South Korea argues that it was unable to present its case for the name &#x27;East Sea&#x27; internationally because it was under Japan&#x27;s colonial rule and in the midst of the Korean War. In 1992, the name &quot;East Sea&quot; was agreed upon as English name for the sea in South Korea and claimed by the country for the sea during its participation in the U.N. Conference on Standardization of Geographical Names.

====Arguments from Japan====
The Japanese government claims that the name Sea of Japan had been internationally used since the 17th century and established by the early 19th century, during which Japan was under an isolationist policy (Sakoku) of the Tokugawa shogunate that restricted cultural exchange and commerce with foreign countries except China and the Netherlands until 1854. Accordingly, they state, Japan could not have, at that time, had an influence on the international community regarding the naming of the sea.

The invention of the marine chronometer in the late 18th century enabled Western explorers, such as Jean-François de Galaup from France, William Robert Broughton from Britain, and Adam Johann von Krusenstern (Ivan Fyodorovich Kruzenshtern) from Russia, to measure time and longitudes on the sea precisely and map the detailed shape of the Sea of Japan. Krusenstern was an admiral and explorer, who led the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe. According to Japanese records, it was Krusenstern who popularized the name &quot;Mer du Japon&quot; (Sea of Japan) in the West. In his work &quot;Reise um die Welt in den Jahren&quot; (1812), he wrote, &quot;People also call this sea area the Sea of Korea, but because only a small part of this sea touches the Korean coast, it is better to name it the Sea of Japan.&quot; The original book was published in St. Petersburg in German and Russian, translated into Dutch, French, Swedish, Italian, and English, and distributed widely among Europe. As a result, the international name of the sea changed from no name to the Sea of Japan, on the maps drawn by countries other than Japan or Korea during the 17th to 20th centuries. Thus, the Japanese side argues that the South Koreans misunderstand the history of the name.

====Surveys of antiquarian maps====

To provide evidence for the date when Sea of Japan came to be used internationally, both South Korea and Japan have undertaken surveys of various historical maps.

In 2004, South Korea surveyed ancient maps archived in the British Library, the Cambridge University Library, the University of Southern California (USC) East Asian Map Collection, the U.S. Library of Congress, the National Library of Russia, and the French National Library. South Korean researchers examined 762 maps. They found that 440 maps had used Sea of Korea (Corea), Oriental Sea/East Sea, 122 had used Sea of Japan, and 200 had used other terms. In the French language, the word &quot;orientale&quot; includes both the meaning of &quot;eastern&quot; related to compass direction and the meaning of &quot;oriental&quot;, the Asiatic region. The same ambiguity is present in the Russian language, with both &quot;eastern&quot; and &quot;oriental&quot; indicated by one word.

From 2003 to 2008, Japan conducted a number of surveys of different collections. In 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan published their conclusions; they found that among 1,332 maps from the Berlin Library, 279 used Sea of Korea, Oriental Sea, or East Sea (or some combination thereof), 579 used Sea of Japan exclusively, 47 used China Sea (with or without other names), 33 used other term, and 384 used no term. The ministry said the Struck collection (a collection of antiquarian maps owned by a European map collector) showed that out of 79 maps, 35 used Sea of Japan, 9 used the Sea of Korea, 2 used Oriental Sea, and 33 were unmarked. It also reported that among four Russian libraries and document archives holding 51 maps, 29 used Sea of Japan, 8 used Sea of Korea, 1 used Korea Strait, 1 used East Sea, 1 used Sea of China, and 11 used no name. Among 1,213 maps from the U.S. Library of Congress, the ministry said, ones that gave a name for this body of water showed that 87 percent used Sea of Japan, 8 percent used Sea of Korea, 5 percent used other terms, and none used Oriental Sea or East Sea. Similarly, the ministry said that 58 maps from the British Library and the University of Cambridge showed 86 percent used Sea of Japan, 14 percent used Sea of Korea, and none used Oriental Sea, East Sea, or other terms. The ministry said that they looked at 1,485 maps in the French National Library. They reported that 95 percent of 215 French maps used Sea of Japan.

===Geographical arguments===
Japan argues that, the name Sea of Japan has been and should be used because the marginal sea is separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Japanese Archipelago. Korea argues that the adjective &quot;East&quot; describes its geographical position east of the Asian continent, although it is west of Japan and south of Russia. It states that this is analogous to the North Sea, which lies north of the European continent, but west of Scandinavian countries and east of Great Britain.

===Arguments relating to ambiguity===

The Japanese Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japanese Coast Guard has claimed that the name East Sea is confusing and unsuitable as an international geographic name, because the local name for a variety of seas can be translated into English as East Sea. Examples include Dōng Hǎi (东海), the Chinese name for the East China Sea; &quot;Biển Đông&quot;, the Vietnamese name for the South China Sea; and the Baltic Sea, whose name is equivalent to East Sea in several European languages such as German (&quot;Ostsee&quot;), Swedish (&quot;Östersjön&quot;) and Finnish (&quot;Itämeri&quot;). East Sea is officially used as an English name for the body of water by the Government of Vietnam and the Government of Vietnam thusly uses East Sea for South China Sea in its English-language publications;
likewise, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China uses &#x27;East Sea&#x27; for the East China Sea in its English-language publications.
Even within Japan itself the term is already used to refer to the parts of the Pacific Ocean east of middle and upper Honshu, as can be seen in the naming of the Tōkaidō region and the Tōkai region.

The Japanese government is concerned that the name change could set a bad precedent and cause more naming disputes worldwide. The Korean side counters that all these problems are irrelevant as Korea&#x27;s argument is not to replace &#x27;Sea of Japan&#x27; with &#x27;East Sea&#x27; but rather to use the name &#x27;East Sea&#x27; alongside &#x27;Sea of Japan&#x27;.

==Position of international bodies==
The main two international organizations which have been involved in the naming dispute are the International Hydrographic Organization and the United Nations.

===International Hydrographic Organization===
The International Hydrographic Organization is an organization that coordinates with member countries over hydrographic issues. One of the organization&#x27;s functions is to standardise the delineation of nautical regions. In 1929, the organization (then called the International Hydrographic Bureau) published edition 1 of &quot;IHO Special Publication 23&quot; (IHO SP 23) – Limits of Oceans and Seas, which included the limits of the sea area between the Korean Peninsula and Japan and the name Sea of Japan; however, at that time, Korea could not participate in the IHO because it was under Japanese rule. The name Sea of Japan remains in the current edition 3 of S-23, which was published in 1953. South Korea officially joined the IHO in 1957.

In 1974, IHO released Technical Resolution A.4.2.6. This resolution stated that:
It is recommended that where two or more countries share a given geographical feature (such as a bay, a strait, channel or archipelago) under different names, they should endeavour to reach agreement on a single name for the feature concerned. If they have different official languages and cannot agree on a common name form, it is recommended that the name forms of each of the languages in question should be accepted for charts and publications unless technical reasons prevent this practice on small scale charts.
South Korea has argued that this resolution is relevant to the debate about the Sea of Japan and implies that both names should be used; Japan, however, argues that the resolution does not apply to the Sea of Japan, because it does not specify this body of water and only applies to geographical features for which sovereignty is shared between two or more countries and not applicable to high seas like the sea area between the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago. Contrary to Japan&#x27;s claim, there are no high seas in accordance with UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) in the sea area between the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago. Even if Japan&#x27;s usage of the term &quot;high seas&quot; includes exclusive economic zones, there are no grounds in international law for Japan&#x27;s claim that these resolutions are not applicable to the case of East Sea/Sea of Japan. The English Channel/La Manche, which is referred to in the IHO Resolution 1/1972 as an example of concurrent usage, is composed of only the territorial seas and the exclusive economic zones of the UK and France. The East Sea/Sea of Japan is also composed of only territorial seas and exclusive economic zones of its coastal states, which is no different from the case of English Channel/La Manche. Therefore, this resolution should be applicable to the case of East Sea/Sea of Japan.

In 2017, the IHO&#x27;s 1st Sesseion of the Assembly was held and the member states decided to discuss the future of S-23, taking into account the growing need to modernize the publication, the latest edition of which was published in 1953.

At the 2nd Session of the Assembly in 2020, the member states decided to replace the sea area names in S-23 with unique numerical identifiers and to develop a new digital standard (S-130) that meets the requirements of contemporary geographic information systems. While developing a data-set to designate geographic sea areas by a system of unique numerical identifiers only, S-23 is kept publicly available as it is, as part of existing IHO publication, to demonstrate the evolutionary process from the analogue to the digital era. The IHO currently has a project team working to release S-130 by 2026. Japan and South Korea disagree on whether unofficial usage of the name Sea of Japan will decline following S-130&#x27;s replacement of S-23.

===United Nations===
While the United Nations has never directly addressed the issue of establishing an official, standardized name for the sea, several resolutions and statements by the UN have had relevance to the topic. Japan joined the United Nations in 1956, while South Korea and North Korea both joined in 1991.

In 1977, the Third U.N. Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names (UNCSGN) adopted Resolution III/20, entitled &quot;Names of Features beyond a Single Sovereignty&quot;. The resolution recommended that &quot;when countries sharing a given geographical feature do not agree on a common name, it should be a general rule of cartography that the name used by each of the countries concerned will be accepted. A policy of accepting only one or some of such names while excluding the rest would be inconsistent as well as inexpedient in practice.&quot; As with IHO Technical Resolution A.4.2.6, South Korea and Japan disagree about whether or not this policy applies to the East Sea/Sea of Japan.

In 1992, during the 1992 Sixth UNCSGN, the South Korean government, in their first time participating in the UNCSGN, requested that the name the sea be determined through consultation, which the North Korean representative concurred with. The Japanese representative stated that the name of the Sea of Japan had already been accepted worldwide and that any change would introduce confusion. The conference recommended that the parties work together on the issue outside of the conference.

In 1998, South Korea raised the issue again at the Seventh UNCSGN. Japan, however, opposed the method by which the South Korean government proposed the issue, arguing that they had not followed the proper procedure for doing so. Following some debate, South Korea withdrew the issue, and instead recommended that the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names work so that a resolution could be submitted to the Eighth UNSCGN conference. The president of the conference urged that Japan, South Korea, and North Korea work towards a mutually acceptable agreement.

At the Eighth UNCSGN in 2002, South Korea and Japan presented a number of papers to the conference regarding their positions on the naming issue. South Korea asked for a resolution to adjudicate the name, while Japan asked that the name be decided through resolution outside of the conference. No resolution was passed, and the Committee again urged the countries to develop a mutually agreeable solution. The chairman further noted that standardization could only occur after consensus had been reached. The same situation occurred at the Ninth Conference in 2007. South Korea and North Korea both proposed a resolution by the UNCSGN, while Japan expressed a desire to settle the matter outside of the conference, and the Committee urged the members to seek a mutual agreement.

On 23 April 2004, the United Nations affirmed in a written document to the Japanese government that it will continue using the name Sea of Japan in its official documents. However, it agreed to leave the topic open for further discussion. In a letter to South Korea, it was explained that the UN was not determining the validity of either name, but wished to use the term that is most widely used until the parties resolved the disagreement. The letter further stated, &quot;The use of an appellation by the Secretariat based on the practice is without prejudice to any negotiations or agreements between the interested parties and should not be interpreted as advocating or endorsing any party&#x27;s position, and can in no way be invoked by any party in support of a particular position in the matter.&quot;
On 6 August 2012, representatives from South Korea and North Korea addressed an assembly at the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names, asking that the names &quot;East Sea&quot; and &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; be used concurrently for the sea. Ferjan Ormeling Jr., chairman of the conference, responded that the organization had no authority to decide the issue and requested that the involved countries resolve the differences over the name amongst themselves.

==Other countries==
Russia calls this sea &quot;Япо́нское мо́ре&quot; (Yapónskoye móre, Japanese Sea). Japan believes that Russia played a major role in establishing this name internationally, as mentioned above. Chinese government websites exclusively use the name 日本海 (&quot;rìběnhǎi&quot;, &#x27;Japan Sea&#x27;).
In 2003, the French Defense Ministry issued nautical maps that included both terms Sea of Japan and East Sea. It reverted to Sea of Japan as a single name in the map issued in 2004. The United Kingdom and Germany officially use the Sea of Japan.

The United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) continues to advocate the use of Sea of Japan without qualification in U.S. government publications. The World Factbook published by the Central Intelligence Agency follows the BGN&#x27;s guidance. On 8 August 2011, a spokesman for the United States Department of State stated that the United States Board on Geographic Names considered the official name of the sea to be &quot;Sea of Japan&quot;. 

Despite the U.S. government&#x27;s position for the single use of Sea of Japan, in 2011, Virginia state lawmaker David W. Marsden, acting on behalf of Korean-American voters, introduced a bill to the education panel of the Senate of Virginia that would have required public school textbooks to include both &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; and &quot;East Sea&quot; as names. The panel rejected the bill by an 8–7 vote on 26 January 2012. The issue was revisited two years later on 3 February 2014, with the Education Committee of the Virginia House of Delegates passing legislation to use both &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; and &quot;East Sea&quot; in school textbooks. This bill, House Bill (HB) No. 11, was finally passed by the Virginia House of Delegates on 6 February 2014, signed by the Governor on 28 March and became effective on 1 July. The bill states that &quot;all textbooks approved by the Board of Education pursuant to §22.1-238 of the Code of Virginia, when referring to the Sea of Japan, shall note that it is also referred to as the East Sea.&quot;

On 29 June 2012, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt M. Campbell affirmed the BGN&#x27;s position in his response, published on the White House website, to the We the People petition concerning the usage of &quot;Sea of Japan&quot;, in which he stated, &quot;It is longstanding United States policy to refer to each sea or ocean by a single name. This policy applies to all seas, including those bordered by multiple countries that may each have their own names for such bodies of water. Concerning the body of water between the Japanese archipelago and the Korean Peninsula, longstanding U.S. policy is to refer to it as the &quot;Sea of Japan&quot;. He also stated, &quot;We are aware the Republic of Korea refers to the body of water as the &#x27;East Sea,&#x27; and the United States is not asking the Republic of Korea to change its nomenclature. U.S. usage of the &#x27;Sea of Japan&#x27; in no way implies an opinion regarding any issue related to sovereignty.&quot;

Contrary to the position of a few major countries, a number of maps, encyclopedias, and other publications have switched to using both names. Today, it is easy to find examples of the concurrent use of the name &quot;East Sea&quot; and &quot;Sea of Japan&quot; on maps and in textbooks and prominent news media&#x27;s articles both online and offline. For example, National Geographic Map Policy states that the sea between Japan and Korea is called the Sea of Japan by the Japanese and the East Sea by Koreans.

For example, the Manual of Style of the National Geographic Society states that disputed place-names in international waters or jointly controlled by two or more countries should use the conventional name first with other names following in parentheses. 

In 2006, Google put both names on Google Earth, using East Sea near the Korean coast and Sea of Japan near the Japanese coast. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that Sea of Japan is also known as and called by East Sea. On the encyclopedia&#x27;s map, Sea of Japan and East Sea are used concurrently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica-Sea of Japan/East Sea&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<doc id="182246" wikidata="Q866369" url="?curid=182246" title="Bishōnen">
<text>is a Japanese term literally meaning &quot;beautiful youth (boy)&quot; and describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in East Asia: a young man of androgynous beauty. This word originated from the Tang dynasty poem &quot;Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup&quot; by Du Fu. It has always shown the strongest manifestation in Japanese pop culture, gaining in popularity due to the androgynous glam rock bands of the 1970s, but it has roots in ancient Japanese literature, the androsocial and androerotic ideals of the medieval Chinese imperial court and intellectuals, and Indian aesthetic concepts carried over from Hinduism, imported with Buddhism to China. Today, are very popular among girls and women in Japan. Reasons for this social phenomenon may include the unique male and female social relationships found within the genre. Some have theorized that provide a non-traditional outlet for gender relations. Moreover, it breaks down stereotypes surrounding feminine male characters. These are often depicted with very strong martial arts abilities, sports talent, high intelligence, dandy fashion, or comedic flair, traits that are usually assigned to the hero/protagonist role.

==Origin==
The prefix &quot;bi&quot; () more often than not refers to feminine beauty, and &quot;bijin&quot;, literally &quot;beautiful person&quot;, is usually, though not always, used to refer to beautiful women. means &quot;beautiful middle-aged man&quot;. &quot;Biseinen&quot; is to be distinguished from &quot;bishōnen&quot; as is used to describe men who are of age, including those who have entered or completed tertiary education. The term &quot;shōnen&quot; is used to describe boys of middle and high school age. Last, &quot;bishota&quot; can be used to refer to a beautiful, pre-pubescent male child or a childlike male. Outside Japan, &quot;bishōnen&quot; is the most well-known of the three terms, and has become a generic term for all beautiful boys and young men.

The aesthetic of the &quot;bishōnen&quot; began as an ideal of a young lover, originally embodied in the , or adolescent boy, and was influenced by the effeminate male actors who played female characters in kabuki theater. The term arose in the Meiji era, in part to replace the by then obsolete erotic meaning of the older term &quot;wakashū&quot;, whose general meaning of &quot;adolescent boy&quot; had by this point been supplanted by the new term shōnen. The &quot;bishōnen&quot; was conceived of as &quot;aesthetically different from both women and men [...] both the antithesis and the antecedent of adult masculinity&quot;.

The &quot;bishōnen&quot; typically has the same traits as idealized female beauties in Japan: lustrous black hair, opaque skin, red cheeks, etc., but simultaneously retains a male body, making them aesthetically different from both men and women. Western audiences may perceive bishonen as effeminate, but Japanese see them as something like angels, wholly male and female.

Minamoto no Yoshitsune and Amakusa Shirō have been identified as historical &quot;bishōnen&quot;. Ian Buruma notes that Yoshitsune was considered by contemporaries to be not physically prepossessing, but that his legend later grew and due to this, he became depicted with good looks. Abe no Seimei was depicted according to the standards of a Heian-era middle-aged man, but since 1989 he has been depicted as a modern-style &quot;bishōnen&quot;.

Kyokutei Bakin wrote many works with &quot;nanshoku&quot; undertones featuring &quot;bishōnen&quot; characters, and in 1848 he used the term &quot;bishōnen&quot; in the title of a work about the younger &quot;wakashu&quot; partner in the &quot;nanshoku&quot; relationship.

The &quot;bishōnen&quot; aesthetic is continued today in anime and manga, especially &quot;shōjo&quot; and &quot;yaoi&quot;.

==Usage==
Some non-Japanese, especially American, anime and manga fans use the term to refer to any handsome male character regardless of age, or any homosexual character. In the original Japanese, however, &quot;bishōnen&quot; applies only to boys under 18. For those older, the word is used. In the place of &quot;bishōnen&quot;, some fans prefer to use the slightly more sexually neutral or the Anglicized slang term &quot;bishie&quot; (also spelled &quot;bishi&quot;), but these terms remain less common. The term &quot;binanshi&quot; was popular in the 1980s. &quot;Bishōnen&quot; is occasionally used to describe some androgynous female characters, such as Takarazuka actors, Lady Oscar in &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot;, or any women with traits stereotypical to &quot;bishōnen&quot;.

Scottish pop singer Momus notably used the term in his song &quot;Bishonen&quot; from the &quot;Tender Pervert&quot; album (released on Creation Records). Almost 8 minutes long, the song is an epic tale of a young boy raised to die young by an eccentric stepfather.

==Popular culture==

According to Pflugfelder, the bishonen concept can be related to the &quot;smoothie/roughneck&quot; dichotomy of the Edo period. Sophisticated Japanese young men (&quot;smoothies&quot;) competed for hierarchical sexual dominance with so-called &quot;roughneck&quot; (juvenile delinquent) men, with occasional reports of violence between the two groups. By the 1920s the &quot;smoothie&quot; men had won out over the roughnecks in the popular imagination; &quot;rough was no match for smooth&quot;, writes Pflugfelder.

In particular, Japan&#x27;s largest male talent agency, Johnny &amp; Associates Entertainment Company, specializes only in producing male Tarento idols. Accepted into Johnny &amp; Associates in their early teens, these boys, collectively known as &#x27;Johnnys&#x27;, are trained and promoted to become the next leading singing-acting-commercially successful hit sensations. Almost all can be classified as &quot;bishōnen&quot;, exhibiting the same physically feminine features combined with a sometimes deliberately ambivalent sexuality or at the very least, a lack of any hint of a relationship to maintain their popular availability. Many of the bishōnen stars hired by Johnny &amp; Associates eventually abandoned their princely image, and became stock characters in variety shows and other normal day-to-day programming.

==Art==

Besides being a character type, &quot;bishōnen&quot; is also a distinct art style not usually forgotten in books about drawing manga. In art, &quot;bishōnen&quot; are usually drawn delicately, with long limbs, silky or flowing hair, and slender eyes with long eyelashes that can sometimes extend beyond the face. The character&#x27;s &quot;sex appeal&quot; is highlighted through introducing the character by using an &quot;eroticized&quot; full-page spread. Characters with &quot;bulging muscles&quot; are rarely considered &quot;bishōnen&quot;, as they are too masculine.

Bishōnen characters are fairly common in shōjo manga and anime. Many of the male characters show subtle signs of the &quot;bishōnen&quot; style, such as slender eyes or a feminine face.

Some manga are completely drawn in the &quot;bishōnen&quot; style, such as &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;. &quot;bishōnen&quot; manga are generally shōjo manga (girls&#x27; comics) or yaoi (girls&#x27; comics focused on homosexual relationships between beautiful boys), however shōnen manga (boy&#x27;s comics) may use casts of &quot;bishōnen&quot; characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, with some degree of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as a more lighthearted constant reminder of his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant &quot;bishōnen&quot; in the role of the recurring minor rivals readers love to hate, though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.

==&quot;Bishōnen&quot; and &quot;bishōjo&quot;==
&quot;Bishōjo&quot; (&#x27;beautiful girl&#x27;) is often mistakenly considered a parallel of &quot;bishōnen&quot;, because of the similar construction of the terms. There are major differences between the two aesthetics. The &quot;bishōjo&quot; aesthetic is aimed at a male audience, and is typically centered on young girls, drawn in a cute, pretty style; &quot;bishōnen&quot; is aimed at a female audience, centered on teenage boys, and drawn elegantly. Another common mistake is assuming that the female characters in &quot;bishōnen&quot; manga and anime are &quot;bishōjo&quot;. In truth, female characters in &quot;bishōnen&quot; manga are very different from those in &quot;bishōjo&quot;; &quot;bishōjo&quot; females are usually more petite and drawn in a style that is cute rather than beautiful, whereas &quot;bishōnen&quot; females exhibit the long limbs and elegance of the &quot;bishōnen&quot; themselves.

==Critical attention==

Several cultural anthropologists and authors have raised the multifaceted aspect of what &quot;bishōnen&quot; represents and what it is interpreted as, mostly to fit a particular external viewpoint. Ian Buruma noted that although Western comics for girls also included &quot;impossibly beautiful men&quot; who are clearly masculine and always get the girl in the end, the &quot;bishōnen&quot; are &quot;more ambivalent&quot; and sometimes get each other.

For Sandra Buckley, &quot;bishōnen&quot; narratives champion &quot;the imagined potentialities of alternative [gender] differentiations&quot; James Welker describes the &quot;bishōnen&quot; as being &quot;queer&quot;, as the &quot;bishōnen&quot; is an androgynous aesthete with a feminine soul &quot;who lives and loves outside of the heteropatriarchal world&quot;.

Jonathan D. Mackintosh believes that the &quot;bishōnen&quot; is a &quot;traditional representation of youth&quot;, being &quot;interstitial&quot; between both childhood and adulthood and between being male and being female, regardless of the sexual issues.

Ishida Hitoshi makes the case that the image of the &quot;bishōnen&quot; is more about a grounding in sexuality than a transcendence of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 1960s, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.

Representations of men in manga by and for men show &quot;an idealized man being ultramasculine and phallic&quot;, &quot;bishōnen&quot; are conversely drawn to &quot;emphasize their beauty and sensuality&quot;, and female artists have been said to react against the ultramasculine representation by showing androgynous and &quot;aesthetically beautiful&quot; men.

Ian Buruma, writing in 1984, considered the &quot;bishonen in distress&quot; to be a recurring motif in popular manga. The &quot;bishōnen&quot; in distress is always rescued by an older, protective, mentor. This scenario has an &quot;unmistakably homoerotic&quot; atmosphere. He also notes that &quot;bishōnen&quot; must either grow up, or die beautifully. He considers the &quot;worship&quot; of the &quot;bishōnen&quot; to be the same as that of the sakura, and notes that &quot;death is the only pure and thus fitting end to the perfection of youth.&quot;

<text>Paektu Mountain or Baekdu Mountain () is an active stratovolcano on the Chinese–North Korean border. In China, it is known as Changbai Mountain (). At , it is the tallest mountain in North Korea and Northeast China and the tallest mountain of the Baekdu-daegan and Changbai mountain ranges. The highest peak, called Janggun Peak, belongs to North Korea. The mountain notably has a caldera that contains a large crater lake called Heaven Lake, and is also the source of the Songhua, Tumen, and Yalu rivers. Korean and Manchu people assign a mythical quality to the mountain and its lake, and consider the mountain to be their ancestral homeland.

The mountain&#x27;s caldera was formed by an eruption in 946 that released about of tephra. The eruption was among the largest and most powerful eruptions on Earth in the last 5,000 years. The volcano last erupted in 1903, and is expected to erupt around every hundred years. In the 2010s, concerns over an upcoming eruption prompted several countries to commission research into when the volcano might next erupt.

The mountain is considered culturally important to multiple groups in the area, including Korean, Chinese, and Manchu people. The mountain is a major national symbol for both North and South Korea, and is mentioned in both national anthems and depicted on the national emblem of North Korea. The Manchu people also consider the mountain their ancestral homeland, and the Chinese Qing dynasty saw it as a symbol of imperial power and the mountain had been subject to territorial disputes over the past few centuries. In the late 20th century, the states of China and North Korea diplomatically agreed to joint custody.

== Names ==
The mountain was first recorded in the Chinese &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; under the name &quot;Bùxiánshān&quot; (). It is also called &quot;Shànshàndàlǐng&quot; () in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot;. In the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; and the &quot;Book of Sui&quot; it is also referred to as &quot;Dutàishān&quot; (徒太山), which is also mentioned as &quot;Cóngtàishān&quot; (從太山) in the &quot;History of the Northern Dynasties&quot;, likely as a misspelling of &quot;Dutàishān&quot;. In the &quot;New Book of Tang&quot;, it was called &quot;Tàibáishān&quot; (). The current Chinese name, C&quot;hángbáishān&quot; (), was first used in the Liao dynasty (916–1125) of the Khitans and then the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) of the Jurchens. The &quot;Liao Shi&quot; recorded that chiefs of 30 Jurchen tribes from Mount Changbai paid their tribute to the Liao in AD 985. According to the Song dynasty travelogue &quot;Songmo Jiwen&quot;, it was named as such because the mountain was &quot;the abode of the white-robed Guanyin&quot; and its birds and beasts were all white. The modern Manchu name of the mountain, which is (), also means &#x27;ever white mountain&#x27;.

The Korean name &quot;Baekdusan&quot; / &quot;Paektusan&quot; () first appears in literature in the 10th year of Seongjong of Goryeo (991) in the , compiled at the beginning of the Joseon period. It means &#x27;white-head mountain&#x27;. In other records such as the &quot;Samguk yusa&quot; and the &quot;Jewang ungi&quot; it is also called (), which means &#x27;great-white mountain&#x27;. It was also occasionally called &quot;Changbaeksan&quot; (長白山) and &quot;Baeksan&quot; (白山) in the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty. An alternative Chinese name, (), is the transliteration of &quot;Baekdusan&quot;.

The Mongolian name is (), which means &#x27;lofty white mountain&#x27;. In English, various authors have used nonstandard transliterations.

== Current geography and geology ==

Mount Baekdu is tall, making it the highest mountain in North Korea and Northeast China and the highest mountain of the Baekdu-daegan and Changbai mountain ranges.

Mount Baekdu is a stratovolcano whose cone is truncated by a significant caldera. The central section of the mountain rises about per year due to rising levels of magma below the central part of the mountain. Sixteen peaks exceeding line the caldera rim surrounding Heaven Lake. The highest peak, called Janggun Peak, is covered in snow about eight months of the year. The slope is relatively gentle until about . The caldera is about wide and deep, and is partially filled by the waters of Heaven Lake.

Heaven Lake has a circumference of , with an average depth of and maximum depth of . From mid-October to mid-June, the lake is typically covered with ice. Water flows north out of the lake, and near the outlet there is a waterfall. The mountain is the source of the Songhua, Tumen and Yalu rivers. The Tumen and the Yalu form the northern border between North Korea and Russia and China.

=== Climate ===
The weather on the mountain can be very erratic, sometimes severe. The annual average temperature at the peak is . During summer, temperatures of about or higher can be reached, and during winter temperatures can drop to . The lowest record temperature was on 2 January 1997. The average temperature is about in January, and in July, remaining below freezing for eight months of the year. The average wind speed is , peaking at . The relative humidity averages 74%.

== Geological history ==
The geological origin of Mount Baekdu remains a mystery. Two leading theories are a hotspot, or an uncharted portion of the Pacific Plate sinking beneath Mount Baekdu.

Beginning about 5 million years ago, Baekdu Mountain erupted, releasing a series of basaltic lava flows that formed a lava plateau. The construction of the cone of the volcano began approximately 1 million years ago, as the eruptive materials transitioned into trachytic pyroclastic and lava flows. During the cone-construction stage, major Plinian-type eruptions occurred 448, 67.6, 85.8 and 24.5 thousand years ago (ka) and deposited ash in the Japan sea. The cone&#x27;s growth was halted by two widely-recognized major explosive eruptions: Tianwenfeng and Millennium.

=== Tianwenfeng eruption ===
The Tianwenfeng eruption was the formation of a widespread thick layer of grey, yellow pumice preceding the Millennium eruption. The exact age of the eruption is uncertain, since different dating techniques have assigned 4, 51, 61, and 74 ka to this deposit. This eruption formed large areas covered in yellow pumice and ignimbrite. Proximal deposits of pumice fall of the Tianwenfeng are thicker than those of the Millennium eruption. This suggests that the eruption of the Tianwenfeng is significant and maybe of similar magnitude to the Millennium eruption, making the Tianwenfeng eruption also of VEI 6–7.

=== Millennium eruption ===
The mountain&#x27;s caldera was created in 946 by the colossal (VEI 6) &quot;Millennium&quot; or &quot;Tianchi&quot; eruption, one of the most powerful eruptions in the last 5,000 years, comparable to the 230 CE eruption of Lake Taupō and the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora. The eruption, whose tephra has been found in the southern part of Hokkaidō, Japan, and as far away as Greenland, destroyed much of the volcano&#x27;s summit, leaving a caldera that today is filled by Heaven Lake.

According to the Korean historical record &quot;Goryeosa&quot;, in 946 &quot;thunders from heaven&#x27;s drum&quot; were heard in the city of Kaesong, then the capital of Goryeo, about south of the volcano. The event reportedly terrified King Jeongjong so much, that convicts were pardoned and set free. According to the Heungboksa Temple&#x27;s historical records, on 3 November, &quot;white ash rain&quot; fell in Nara, Japan, about southeast from the mountain Three months later, on 7 February 947, explosive noises were reported in the city of Kyoto (Japan), about southeast of Paektu.

=== Later history ===
After these major eruptions, Mount Paektu had at least three smaller eruptions, which occurred in 1668, 1702, and 1903, likely forming the Baguamiao ignimbrite, the Wuhaojie fine pumice, and the Liuhaojie tuff ring.

=== Research on upcoming eruption ===

In 2011, experts in North and South Korea met to discuss the potential for a significant eruption in the near future, as the last eruption was in 1903 and the volcano is expected to erupt around every 100 years. The Government of North Korea invited several volcanologists, including James Hammond, Clive Oppenheimer, and Kayla Iacovino, to study the mountain for recent volcanic activity. This made Iacovino the first foreign female researcher to conduct research in North Korea. The researchers began publishing their research in 2016 and in February 2020 formed the Mt. Paektu Research Center.

== Flora and fauna ==
There are five known species of plants in the lake on the peak, and some 168 have been counted along its shores. The forest on the Chinese side is ancient and almost unaltered by humans. Birch predominates near the tree line, and pine lower down, mixed with other species. There has been extensive deforestation on the lower slopes on the North Korean side of the mountain.

The area is a known habitat for Siberian tigers, bears, wolves, and wild boars. The Ussuri dholes may have been extirpated from the area. Deer in the mountain forests, which cover the mountain up to about , are of the Paekdusan roe deer kind. Many wild birds such as black grouse, owls, and woodpecker are known to inhabit the area. The mountain has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports a population of scaly-sided mergansers.

== Cultural history ==
The mountain has been worshipped by the surrounding peoples throughout history. A considerable percentage of the Koreans and Manchus consider it sacred, especially the Heaven Lake in its crater.

=== Korea ===

The mountain has been considered sacred by Koreans throughout history. According to Korean mythology, it was the birthplace of Dangun, the founder of Gojoseon (2333–108 BC), whose parents were said to be Hwanung, the Son of Heaven, and Ungnyeo, a bear who had been transformed into a woman. Many subsequent kingdoms of Korea, such as Buyeo, Goguryeo, Balhae, Goryeo and Joseon recognized this myth.

The Goryeo dynasty (935–1392) first called the mountain &quot;Baekdu&quot;, recording that the Jurchens across the Yalu River were made to live outside of Mount Baekdu. The Joseon dynasty (1392–1910) recorded volcanic eruptions in 1597, 1668, and 1702. In the 15th century, King Sejong strengthened the fortification along the Tumen and Yalu rivers, making the mountain a natural border with the northern peoples. Some Koreans claim that the entire region near Mount Paektu and the Tumen River belongs to Korea and parts of it were illegally given away by Japanese colonialists to China through the Gando Convention.

Mount Baekdu is mentioned in the national anthems of both North and South Korea and in the Korean folk song &quot;Arirang&quot;.

Dense forest around the mountain provided bases for Korean armed resistance against the Japanese occupation, and later communist guerrillas during the Korean War. Kim Il Sung organized his resistance against the Japanese forces there, and North Korea claims that Kim Jong Il was born there, although records outside of North Korea suggest that he was born in the Soviet Union.

The peak has been featured on the state emblem of North Korea since 1993, as defined in Article 169 of the Constitution, which describes Mt. Paektu as &quot;the sacred mountain of the revolution&quot;. The mountain is often referred to in slogans such as: &quot;Let us accomplish the Korean revolution in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu!&quot; North Korean media celebrates natural phenomena witnessed at the mountain as portentous, and weather forecasts aired by state broadcaster Korean Central Television list Paektusan Secret Camp, claimed birthplace of Kim Jong Il, behind only the capital of Pyongyang. The mountain&#x27;s name is used for various products, such as the Paektusan rocket, the Paektusan computer, and the Mt Paektu handgun.

In the 2019 South Korean disaster film &quot;Ashfall&quot;, the mountain erupts and causes severe earthquakes in the Korean peninsula.

In the popular strategy game Europa Universalis 4 the mountain appears as part of a Korean mission entitled &quot;Access to Mt. Paektu&quot; where the player must obtain the province the mountain occurs in.

=== China ===
Mount Changbai was regarded as the most sacred mountain in the shamanist religion of the Manchus, and their ancestors Sushen and Jurchens. The Jin dynasty bestowed the title &quot;the King Who Makes the Nation Prosperous and Answers with Miracles&quot; () on the mountain in 1172 and it was entitled &quot;the Emperor Who Cleared the Sky with Tremendous Sagehood&quot; () in 1193. A temple for the mountain god was constructed on the northern side.

The Manchu clan Aisin Gioro, which founded the Qing dynasty of China, claimed their progenitor Bukūri Yongšon was conceived near Paektu Mountain. In 1682, 1698, 1733, 1754 and 1805, Qing emperors visited Jilin and paid homage to the mountain. The rites at Mount Changbai were heavily influenced by the ancient Feng Shan ceremonies, in which Chinese emperors offered sacrifices to heaven and earth at Mount Tai. The Kangxi Emperor claimed that Mount Tai and Changbai belong to the same mountain range, which runs from northeast to southwest but is partially submerged under the sea before reaching Shandong. The geography and feng shui of Mount Changbai thus provided legitimacy to the Aisin Gioro clan&#x27;s rule over China.

&quot;Baishan Heishui&quot;, &quot;white mountain and black river&quot;, referring to Mount Changbai and the Heilongjiang, has been a traditional name for Northeast China since the Jin dynasty.

== Sovereignty disputes ==

=== Historical ===

According to &quot;Annals of the Joseon Dynasty&quot;, the Yalu and Tumen Rivers were set as the borders in the era of the founder of Joseon Dynasty, Taejo of Joseon (1335–1408). Because of the continuous entry of Korean people into Gando, a region in Manchuria that lay north of the Tumen, Manchu and Korean officials surveyed the area and negotiated a border agreement in 1712. To mark the agreement, they built a monument describing the boundary at a watershed, near the south of the crater lake at the mountain peak.
Volume 8 of the Annals of King Taejo, 2nd article of Gyemyo, 14 December, 4th year of King Taejo, 1395, 28th year of Ming Hongwu
Since the 19th century, interpretations of the inscription have been relevant in some territorial disputes.

The 1909 Gando Convention between China and Japan, when Korea was under Japanese rule, recognized the north and east of the mountain as Chinese territory.

=== Recent ===

In 1962 and 1964, China and North Korea negotiated two treaties in secret that outlined their modern borders. Both treaties especially focused on the sovereignty of Paektu and Heaven Lake. As a result of the treaties, North Korea received of land on and around Paektu, 9 out of 16 peaks, and 54.5% of Heaven Lake. Neither treaty is recognized by the governments of Taiwan or South Korea.

, South Korea formally claimed the caldera lake and the inside part of the ridge. However, some South Korean groups argue that recent activities conducted on the Chinese side of the border, such as economic development, cultural festivals, infrastructure development, promotion of the tourism industry, attempts at registration as a World Heritage Site, and bids for a Winter Olympic Games, constitute attempts to claim the mountain as Chinese territory. These groups object to China&#x27;s use of the name &quot;Mount Changbai&quot;. Some groups also regard the entire mountain as Korean territory that was given away by North Korea in the Korean War.

During the 2007 Asian Winter Games, which were held in Changchun, China, a group of South Korean athletes held up signs during the award ceremony which stated &quot;Mount Paektu is our territory&quot;. Chinese sports officials delivered a letter of protest on the grounds that political activities violated the spirit of the Olympics and were banned in the charter of the International Olympic Committee and the Olympic Council of Asia. Officials from the South Korean athletic team apologized to China.

== Tourism ==
Most Chinese, Russian, South Korean and international visitors climb the mountain from the Chinese side. The North Korean side of the mountain is also popular among visitors to North Korea. The Chinese tourism area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.

There are a number of monuments on the North Korean side of the mountain. Paektu Spa is a natural spring and is used for bottled water. Pegae Hill is a camp site of the allegedly led by Kim Il Sung during their struggle against Japanese colonial rule. Secret camps are also now open to the public. There are several waterfalls, including the Hyongje Falls which splits into two about a third of the way from the top. In 1992, on the occasion of the 80th birthday of Kim Il Sung, a large sign with the words &quot;Holy mountain of the revolution&quot; written in metal letters was erected on the side of the mountain. North Koreans claim that there are 216 steps leading to the top of the mountain, symbolizing Kim Jong Il&#x27;s 16 February birth date, but this claim is disputed. On the North Korean side of the mountain, there is a funicular system with two cars. This was updated with new funicular cars built by the Kim Chong-t&#x27;ae Electric Locomotive Works, with the new cars successfully running on the funicular from 30 October 2020.

<text>A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) or cryptographic pseudorandom number generator (CPRNG) is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) with properties that make it suitable for use in cryptography. It is also referred to as a cryptographic random number generator (CRNG).

== Background ==

Most cryptographic applications require random numbers, for example:
* key generation
* initialization vectors
* nonces
* salts in certain signature schemes, including ECDSA and RSASSA-PSS
* token generation

The &quot;quality&quot; of the randomness required for these applications varies. For example, creating a nonce in some protocols needs only uniqueness. On the other hand, the generation of a master key requires a higher quality, such as more entropy. And in the case of one-time pads, the information-theoretic guarantee of perfect secrecy only holds if the key material comes from a true random source with high entropy, and thus any kind of pseudorandom number generator is insufficient.

Ideally, the generation of random numbers in CSPRNGs uses entropy obtained from a high-quality source, generally the operating system&#x27;s randomness API. However, unexpected correlations have been found in several such ostensibly independent processes. From an information-theoretic point of view, the amount of randomness, the entropy that can be generated, is equal to the entropy provided by the system. But sometimes, in practical situations, numbers are needed with more randomness than the available entropy can provide. Also, the processes to extract randomness from a running system are slow in actual practice. In such instances, a CSPRNG can sometimes be used. A CSPRNG can &quot;stretch&quot; the available entropy over more bits.

==Requirements==
The requirements of an ordinary PRNG are also satisfied by a cryptographically secure PRNG, but the reverse is not true. CSPRNG requirements fall into two groups:

# They pass statistical randomness tests:
#* Every CSPRNG should satisfy the next-bit test. That is, given the first k bits of a random sequence, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can predict the (k+1)th bit with probability of success non-negligibly better than 50%. Andrew Yao proved in 1982 that a generator passing the next-bit test will pass all other polynomial-time statistical tests for randomness.
# They hold up well under serious attack, even when part of their initial or running state becomes available to an attacker:
#* Every CSPRNG should withstand &quot;state compromise extension attacks&quot;. In the event that part or all of its state has been revealed (or guessed correctly), it should be impossible to reconstruct the stream of random numbers prior to the revelation. Additionally, if there is an entropy input while running, it should be infeasible to use knowledge of the input&#x27;s state to predict future conditions of the CSPRNG state.

For instance, if the PRNG under consideration produces output by computing bits of pi in sequence, starting from some unknown point in the binary expansion, it may well satisfy the next-bit test and thus be statistically random, as pi is conjectured to be a normal number. However, this algorithm is not cryptographically secure; an attacker who determines which bit of pi is currently in use (i.e. the state of the algorithm) will be able to calculate all preceding bits as well.

Most PRNGs are not suitable for use as CSPRNGs and will fail on both counts. First, while most PRNGs&#x27; outputs appear random to assorted statistical tests, they do not resist determined reverse engineering. Specialized statistical tests may be found specially tuned to such a PRNG that shows the random numbers not to be truly random. Second, for most PRNGs, when their state has been revealed, all past random numbers can be retrodicted, allowing an attacker to read all past messages, as well as future ones.

CSPRNGs are designed explicitly to resist this type of cryptanalysis.

==Definitions==
In the asymptotic setting, a family of deterministic polynomial time computable functions formula_1 for some polynomial , is a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG, or PRG in some references), if it stretches the length of its input (formula_2 for any ), and if its output is computationally indistinguishable from true randomness, i.e. for any probabilistic polynomial time algorithm , which outputs 1 or 0 as a distinguisher,

: formula_3

for some negligible function formula_4. (The notation formula_5 means that is chosen uniformly at random from the set .)

There is an equivalent characterization: For any function family formula_1, is a PRNG if and only if the next output bit of cannot be predicted by a polynomial time algorithm.

A forward-secure PRNG with block length formula_7 is a PRNG formula_8, where the input string formula_9 with length is the current state at period , and the output (formula_10, formula_11) consists of the next state formula_10 and the pseudorandom output block formula_11 of period , that withstands state compromise extensions in the following sense. If the initial state formula_14 is chosen uniformly at random from formula_15, then for any , the sequence formula_16 must be computationally indistinguishable from formula_17, in which the formula_18 are chosen uniformly at random from formula_19.

Any PRNG formula_20 can be turned into a forward secure PRNG with block length formula_21 by splitting its output into the next state and the actual output. This is done by setting formula_22, in which formula_23 and formula_24; then is a forward secure PRNG with formula_25 as the next state and formula_26 as the pseudorandom output block of the current period.

==Entropy extraction==
Santha and Vazirani proved that several bit streams with weak randomness can be combined to produce a higher-quality, quasi-random bit stream.
Even earlier, John von Neumann proved that a simple algorithm can remove a considerable amount of the bias in any bit stream, which should be applied to each bit stream before using any variation of the Santha–Vazirani design.

==Designs==
CSPRNG designs are divided into two classes:
# Designs based on cryptographic primitives such as ciphers and cryptographic hashes
# Designs based on mathematical problems thought to be hard

===Designs based on cryptographic primitives===
* A secure block cipher can be converted into a CSPRNG by running it in counter mode using, for example, a special construct that the NIST in SP 800-90A calls CTR DRBG. CTR_DBRG typically uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
** AES-CTR_DRBG is often used as a random number generator in systems that use AES encryption.
** The NIST CTR_DRBG scheme erases the key &quot;after&quot; the requested randomness is output by running additional cycles. This is wasteful from a performance perspective, but does not immediately cause issues with forward secrecy. However, realizing the performance implications, the NIST recommends an &quot;extended AES-CTR-DRBG interface&quot; for its Post-Quantum Cryptography Project submissions. This interface allows multiple sets of randomness to be generated without intervening erasure, only erasing when the user explicitly signals the end of requests. As a result, the key could remain in memory for an extended time if the &quot;extended interface&quot; is misused. Newer &quot;fast-key-erasure&quot; RNGs erase the key with randomness as soon as randomness is requested.
* A stream cipher can be converted into a CSPRNG. This has been done with RC4, ISAAC, and ChaCha20, to name a few.
* A cryptographically secure hash might also be a base of a good CSPRNG, using, for example, a construct that NIST calls Hash DRBG.
* An HMAC primitive can be used as a base of a CSPRNG, for example, as part of the construct that NIST calls HMAC DRBG.

===Number-theoretic designs===
* The Blum Blum Shub algorithm has a security proof based on the difficulty of the quadratic residuosity problem. Since the only known way to solve that problem is to factor the modulus, it is generally regarded that the difficulty of integer factorization provides a conditional security proof for the Blum Blum Shub algorithm. However the algorithm is very inefficient and therefore impractical unless extreme security is needed.
* The Blum–Micali algorithm has a security proof based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem but is also very inefficient.
* Daniel Brown of Certicom wrote a 2006 security proof for Dual EC DRBG, based on the assumed hardness of the &quot;Decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption&quot;, the &quot;x-logarithm problem&quot;, and the &quot;truncated point problem&quot;. The 2006 proof explicitly assumes a lower &quot;outlen&quot; (amount of bits provided per iteration) than in the Dual_EC_DRBG standard, and that the &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; in the Dual_EC_DRBG standard (which were revealed in 2013 to be probably backdoored by NSA) are replaced with non-backdoored values.

===Practical schemes===
&quot;Practical&quot; CSPRNG schemes not only include an CSPRNG algorithm, but also a way to initialize (&quot;seed&quot;) it while keeping the seed secret. A number of such schemes have been defined, including:

* Implementations of /dev/random in Unix-like systems.
** Yarrow, which attempts to evaluate the entropic quality of its seeding inputs, and uses SHA-1 and 3DES internally. Yarrow was used in macOS and other Apple OS&#x27; up until about December 2019, after which it switched to Fortuna.
** Fortuna, the successor to Yarrow, which does not attempt to evaluate the entropic quality of its inputs; it uses SHA-256 and &quot;any good block cipher&quot;. Fortuna is used in FreeBSD. Apple changed to Fortuna for most or all Apple OSs beginning around Dec. 2019.
** The Linux kernel CSPRNG, which uses ChaCha20 to generate data, and BLAKE2s to ingest entropy.
* &quot;arc4random&quot;, a CSPRNG in Unix-like systems that seeds from . It originally is based on RC4, but all main implementations now use ChaCha20.
* &quot;CryptGenRandom&quot;, part of Microsoft&#x27;s CryptoAPI, offered on Windows. Different versions of Windows use different implementations.
* ANSI X9.17 standard (&quot;Financial Institution Key Management (wholesale)&quot;), which has been adopted as a FIPS standard as well. It takes as input a TDEA (keying option 2) key bundle &quot;k&quot; and (the initial value of) a 64-bit random seed &quot;s&quot;. Each time a random number is required, it executes the following steps:
Obviously, the technique is easily generalized to any block cipher; AES has been suggested. If the key &quot;k&quot; is leaked, the entire X9.17 stream can be predicted; this weakness is cited as a reason for creating Yarrow.

All these above-mentioned schemes, save for X9.17, also mix the state of a CSPRNG with an additional source of entropy. They are therefore not &quot;pure&quot; pseudorandom number generators, in the sense that the output is not completely determined by their initial state. This addition aims to prevent attacks even if the initial state is compromised.

==Standards==
Several CSPRNGs have been standardized. For example:
* FIPS 186-4
* NIST SP 800-90A

* NIST SP 800-90A Rev.1

* ANSI X9.17-1985 Appendix C
* ANSI X9.31-1998 Appendix A.2.4
* ANSI X9.62-1998 Annex A.4, obsoleted by ANSI X9.62-2005, Annex D (HMAC_DRBG)

A good reference is maintained by NIST.

There are also standards for statistical testing of new CSPRNG designs:
* &quot;A Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators&quot;, NIST Special Publication 800-22.

==Security flaws==

===NSA kleptographic backdoor in the Dual_EC_DRBG PRNG===

&quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2013 that the National Security Agency (NSA) inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) of NIST SP 800-90A, which allows the NSA to readily decrypt material that was encrypted with the aid of Dual EC DRBG. Both papers reported that, as independent security experts long suspected, the NSA had been introducing weaknesses into CSPRNG standard 800-90; this being confirmed for the first time by one of the top-secret documents leaked to &quot;The Guardian&quot; by Edward Snowden. The NSA worked covertly to get its own version of the NIST draft security standard approved for worldwide use in 2006. The leaked document states that &quot;eventually, NSA became the sole editor&quot;. In spite of the known potential for a kleptographic backdoor and other known significant deficiencies with Dual_EC_DRBG, several companies such as RSA Security continued using Dual_EC_DRBG until the backdoor was confirmed in 2013. RSA Security received a $10 million payment from the NSA to do so.

===DUHK attack===
On October 23, 2017, Shaanan Cohney, Matthew Green, and Nadia Heninger, cryptographers at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University, released details of the DUHK (Don&#x27;t Use Hard-coded Keys) attack on WPA2 where hardware vendors use a hardcoded seed key for the ANSI X9.31 RNG algorithm, stating &quot;an attacker can brute-force encrypted data to discover the rest of the encryption parameters and deduce the master encryption key used to encrypt web sessions or virtual private network (VPN) connections.&quot;

===Japanese PURPLE cipher machine===
During World War II, Japan used a cipher machine for diplomatic communications; the United States was able to crack it and read its messages, mostly because the &quot;key values&quot; used were insufficiently random.

<text>Maurice, Count of Saxony (, ; 28 October 1696 – 20 November 1750) was a notable soldier, officer and a famed military commander of the 18th century. The illegitimate son of Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony, he initially served in the Army of the Holy Roman Empire, then the Imperial Army, before finally entering French service. De Saxe became a Marshal and even Marshal General of France. He is best known for his deeds in the War of the Austrian Succession and especially for his decisive victory at the Battle of Fontenoy.

==Childhood==

Maurice was born at Goslar, an illegitimate son of Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania and Elector of Saxony, and the Countess Maria Aurora of Königsmarck. He was the first of eight extramarital children whom August acknowledged, although as many as 354 are claimed by sources, including Wilhelmine of Bayreuth, to have existed.

In 1698, the Countess sent him to his father in Warsaw. Augustus had been elected King of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in the previous year, but the unsettled condition of the country obliged Maurice to spend the greater part of his youth outside its borders. This separation from his father made him independent and had an important effect on his future career.

==Military career==


At the age of twelve, Maurice served in the Imperial Army under Prince Eugene of Savoy, at the sieges of Tournai and Mons and at the Battle of Malplaquet during the War of the Spanish Succession. A proposal at the end of the campaign to send him to a Jesuit college in Brussels was dropped due to the protests of his mother.

Upon his return to the camp of the Allies at the beginning of 1710, Maurice displayed a courage so impetuous that Prince Eugene admonished him to not confuse rashness with valour.

He next served under Peter the Great against the Swedes in the Great Northern War. In 1711, Augustus formally recognized him and Maurice was granted the rank of Count (Graf). He then accompanied his father to Pomerania, and in 1712 he took part in the Battle of Gadebusch. At the age of 17 in 1713 he commanded his own regiment of the Royal Saxon Army.

As an adult, Maurice bore a strong resemblance to his father, both physically and in character. His grasp was so powerful that he could bend a horseshoe with his hand, and even at the end of his life, his energy and endurance were scarcely affected by the illnesses his many excesses had caused.

On 12 March 1714, a marriage was arranged between him and one of the richest of his father&#x27;s subjects, Countess Johanna Viktoria Tugendreich von Loeben, but he dissipated her fortune so rapidly that he was soon heavily in debt. The next year (21 January 1715), Johanna gave birth to a son, called August Adolf after his grandfather; the child only lived a few hours. Since Maurice had also given her more serious grounds of complaint against him, he consented to an annulment of the marriage on 21 March 1721.

After serving Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in 1717, he went to Paris to study mathematics, and in 1720 obtained a commission as Maréchal de camp. In 1725, he entered negotiations for election as Duke of Courland, at the insistence of the Duchess Anna Ivanovna, who offered him her hand. He was chosen duke in 1726, but declined marriage with the duchess. He soon found it impossible to resist her opposition to his claims, but with the assistance of £30,000 lent him by the French actress Adrienne Lecouvreur, he raised a force by which he maintained his authority till 1727, when he withdrew and took up residence in Paris. Lecouvreur was to die mysteriously shortly afterwards: there is controversy as to whether or not she was poisoned by her rival, Maria Karolina Sobieska, Duchess of Bouillon.

At the outbreak of the War of the Polish Succession, Maurice served under James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, and for a brilliant exploit at the Siege of Philippsburg he was named lieutenant-general. In the War of the Austrian Succession he took command of an army division sent to invade Austria in 1741, and on 19 November 1741, surprised Prague during the night, and seized it before the garrison was aware of the presence of an enemy, a &quot;coup de main&quot; which made him famous throughout Europe; he thus repeated the exploit of 1648 of his maternal great-grandfather, Hans Christoff von Königsmarck. After capturing the fortress of Eger (Cheb) on 19 April 1742, he received a leave of absence, and went to Russia to push his claims for the Duchy of Courland, but returned to his command after getting nowhere.

Maurice&#x27;s exploits were the sole redeeming feature in an unsuccessful campaign, and on 26 March 1743, his merits were rewarded by promotion to Marshal of France. He had been given only 50–60,000 men to defend against an enemy army twice as large. From this time on, he became one of the great generals of the age. In 1744, he was chosen to command the 10,000 men of the French invasion of Britain on behalf of James Francis Edward Stuart, which assembled at Dunkirk but did not proceed more than a few miles out of harbour before being wrecked by disastrous storms. After its termination, he received an independent command in the Austrian Netherlands, and by skilful manoeuvering succeeded in continually harassing the superior forces of the enemy without risking a decisive battle.
In the following year, Maurice with 65,000 men besieged Tournai and inflicted a severe defeat on the army of the Duke of Cumberland at the Battle of Fontenoy, an encounter determined entirely by his constancy and cool leadership. During the battle, he was unable to sit on horseback due to edema, and was carried about in a wicker chariot.

In recognition of his brilliant achievement, Louis XV conferred on him the Château de Chambord for life, and in April 1746, he was naturalised as a French subject. Until the end of the war, he continued to command in the Netherlands, always with success. Besides Fontenoy he added Rocoux (1746) and Lawfeldt or Val (1747) to the list of French victories. He led the French force which captured Brussels and it was under his orders that Marshal Löwendahl captured Bergen op Zoom. He himself won the last success of the war in capturing Maastricht in 1748.

Saxe invented a handheld light-artillery piece that he called an &quot;amusette&quot;, which fired a half-pound ball a distance of 4,000 paces at a rate of 100 shots an hour.

In 1747 the title once held by Turenne and Villars, &quot;Marshal General of the King&#x27;s camps and armies&quot;, was revived for Maurice. But on 20 November 1750 he died at the Château de Chambord &quot;of a putrid fever&quot;.

During the last years of his life, Maurice had an affair with a French lady, Marie Rinteau, who at that time was only eighteen years old. In 1748 she gave birth to a daughter, the last of Maurice&#x27;s several illegitimate children. She was called Maria Aurora (in French: ) after her grandmother. She bore the surname until 1766 when the Parlement of Paris formally recognized her parentage and she could assume the surname of or . Marie Aurore married firstly in 1766 with Antoine, Count of Horne (1735–1767), an alleged illegitimate son of Louis XV. By her second marriage with Louis Claude Dupin de Francueil (in 1777), she was the grandmother of Amandine Lucile Aurore Dupin, who later became famous as the writer George Sand. Maria Aurore died on 25 December 1821 when her granddaughter George Sand was seventeen. Sand included details of her grandmother&#x27;s parentage in her memoires. 

==Writings==

Saxe&#x27;s work on the art of war, (&quot;My Reveries&quot;), was published after his death in 1757. Described by Carlyle as &quot;a strange military farrago, dictated, as I should think, under opium&quot;, it was praised by Frederick the Great and described by Lord Montgomery, more than two centuries later, as &quot;a remarkable work on the art of war&quot;.

A common theme of the 18th century Age of Enlightenment was to emphasise the scientific method and the idea every activity could be expressed in terms of a universal system. In one sense, followed this by subjecting &quot;military affairs to reasoned criticism and intellectual treatment, and the ensuing military doctrines were perceived as forming a definitive system&quot;. Written following Prussian expansion during the War of the Austrian Succession, Saxe rejected their rigid discipline; arguing the French character was fundamentally different and their tactics should reflect that, he advocated the use of a deep order or , rather than relying on firearms.

However, also challenged French military orthodoxy in arguing for a greater focus on mobile warfare, rather than fortifications; this was partly a legacy of Vauban (1633–1707), who had revolutionised this field but adherence to his principles meant French engineers became ultra-conservative. As early as 1701, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough argued winning one battle was more beneficial than taking 12 fortresses; Saxe followed this line but his argument was given increased weight by French losses in the 1756–1763 Seven Years&#x27; War.

Saxe&#x27;s (&quot;Selected Letters and Memoirs&quot;) appeared in 1794. His letters to his sister Anna Karolina Orzelska, the Duchess of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, preserved at Strasbourg, were destroyed by the bombardment of that place in 1870. Thirty copies had, however, been printed from the original.

==Legacy==
After Maurice de Saxe&#x27;s death in Chambord, a funerary ceremony was held for him in Paris, but as a Protestant, he could not be buried there. His remains were transported to Strasbourg and temporarily kept at the Temple Neuf. At Louis XV&#x27;s request, a permanent mausoleum was created by Jean-Baptiste Pigalle in the apse of St Thomas&#x27; Church, Strasbourg, of which it now marks the focal point. The elaborate monument, under which de Saxe&#x27;s remains were interred on , shows Death holding a sandglass and calling him to the grave while a crying France tries to retain him, and Hercules weeps on the tomb&#x27;s side. To the left are France&#x27;s enemies personnified by three distraught animals: the German eagle, the Dutch lion, and the British lion, and their broken flags, while to the right are France&#x27;s triumphant standards. In the middle stands the heroic marshal holding his baton, unfazed by his fate. Gérard de Nerval believed his majestic pose might have inspired the Commendatore&#x27;s statue in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, based on the fact that Mozart had performed in the church in 1778 shortly after the monument&#x27;s inauguration.

Maurice de Saxe has been the focus of several biographical works. Many previous errors in former biographies were corrected and additional information supplied in Karl von Weber&#x27;s &quot;Moritz Graf von Sachsen, Marschall von Frankreich, nach archivalischen Quellen&quot; [&quot;Moritz Count of Saxony, Marshal of France, according to archival sources&quot;] (Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1863), in Saint-René Taillandier&#x27;s &quot;Maurice de Saxe, étude historique d&#x27;après les documents des archives de Dresde&quot; [&quot;Maurice of Saxe, historical study according to the documents in the archives of Dresden&quot;] (1865) and in &quot;Maurice de Saxe&quot; (Leipzig, 1861).

A biography in English is Jon Manchip White&#x27;s &quot;Marshal of France: The Life and Times of Maurice, Comte de Saxe (1696–1750)&quot; (Rand McNally &amp; Company, Chicago, 1962). See also the military histories of the period, especially Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;.

He is honoured in the Walhalla Memorial.

<text>A trench is a type of excavation or depression in the ground that is generally deeper than it is wide (as opposed to a swale or a bar ditch), and narrow compared with its length (as opposed to a simple hole or pit). 

In geology, trenches result from erosion by rivers or by geological movement of tectonic plates. In civil engineering, trenches are often created to install underground utilities such as gas, water, power and communication lines. In construction, trenches are dug for foundations of buildings, retaining walls and dams, and for cut-and-cover construction of tunnels. In archaeology, the &quot;trench method&quot; is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material. In geotechnical engineering, trench investigations locate faults and investigate deep soil properties. In trench warfare, soldiers occupy trenches to protect them against weapons fire and artillery. 

Trenches are dug using manual tools such as shovel and pickaxe or heavy equipment such as backhoe, trencher, and excavator.

For deep trenches, the instability of steep earthen walls requires engineering and safety techniques such as shoring. Trenches are usually considered temporary structures that are backfilled with soil after construction or abandoned after use. Some trenches are stabilized using durable materials such as concrete to create open passages such as canal and sunken roadways.

== Geology ==
Some trenches are created as a result of erosion by running water or by glaciers (which may have long since disappeared). Others, such as rift valleys or oceanic trenches, are created by geological movement of tectonic plates. Some oceanic trenches include the Mariana Trench and the Aleutian Trench. The former geoform is relatively deep (approximately ), linear and narrow, and is formed by plate subduction when plates converge.

== Civil engineering ==
In the civil engineering fields of construction and maintenance of infrastructure, trenches play a major role. They are used for installation of underground infrastructure or utilities (such as gas mains, water mains, communication lines and pipelines) that would be obstructive or easily damaged if placed above ground. Trenches are needed later for access to these installations for service. They may be created to search for pipes and other infrastructure whose exact location is no longer known (&quot;search trench&quot; or &quot;search slit&quot;). Finally, trenches may be created as the first step of creating a foundation wall. Trench shoring is often used in trenchworks to protect workers and stabilise the steep walls.

An alternative to digging trenches is to create a utility tunnel. Such a tunnel may be dug by boring or by using a trench for cut-and-cover construction. The advantages of utility tunnels are the reduction of maintenance manholes, one-time relocation, and less excavation and repair, compared with separate cable ducts for each service. When they are well mapped, they also allow rapid access to all utilities without having to dig access trenches or resort to confused and often inaccurate utility maps. 

An important advantage to placing utilities underground is public safety. Underground power lines, whether in common or separate channels, prevent downed utility cables from blocking roads, thus speeding emergency access after natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis.

In some cases, a large trench is dug and deliberately preserved (not filled in), often for transport purposes. This is typically done to install depressed motorways, open railway cuttings, or canals. However, these large, permanent trenches are significant barriers to other forms of travel, and often become de facto boundaries between neighborhoods or other spaces.

== Military engineering ==
Trenches have often been dug for military purposes. In the pre-firearm era, they were mainly a type of hindrance to an attacker of a fortified location, such as the moat around a castle (this is technically called a ditch). An early example of this can be seen in the Battle of the Trench, a religious war, one of the early battles fought by Muhammad.

With the advent of accurate firearms, trenches were used to shelter troops. Trench warfare and tactics evolved further in the Crimean War, the American Civil War and World War I, until systems of extensive main trenches, backup trenches (in case the first lines were overrun) and communication trenches often stretched dozens of kilometres along a front without interruption, and some kilometres further back from the front line. The area of land between trenches in trench warfare is known as &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; because it often offers no protection from enemy fire. After WW1 had concluded, the trench became a symbol of WW1 and its horrors.

Trenches are used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material to get a sideways (layered) view of the deposits – with a hope of being able to place found objects or materials in a chronological order. The advantage of this method is that it destroys only a small part of the site (those areas where the trenches, often arranged in a grid pattern, are located). However, this method also has the disadvantage of only revealing small slices of the whole volume, and modern archeological digs usually employ combination methods.

== Safety ==
Trenches that are deeper than about 1.5 m present safety risks arising from their steep walls and confined space. These risks are similar those from pits or any steep-walled excavations. The risks include falling, injury from cave-in (wall collapse), inability to escape the trench, drowning and asphyxiation.
* Falling into the trench. Mitigation methods include barriers such as railings or fencing.
* Injury from cave-in, meaning collapse of a steep wall. Mitigation includes construction of sloped walls (&quot;sloped trench&quot;) or stepped walls (&quot;benched trench&quot;). For vertical walls, trench shoring stabilizes the walls, and trench shielding provides a barrier against collapsed material. The risk of cave-in increases from &quot;surcharge load&quot;, which is any weight placed outside the trench near its edge. These loads include the &quot;spoil pile&quot; (soil excavated from the trench) or heavy equipment. These add extra stress to the walls of the trench.
* Inability to escape the trench because of steep and unstable walls, which may be difficult to climb. Ladders, stairs, or ramps allow exit. Cranes may assist rescue. 
* Drowning in water or mud that has accumulated in the trench from rain, seepage, or leaking water pipes.
* Asphyxiation, poisoning, fire and explosion from gasses that are denser than air that have settled in a trench. These may come from nearby industrial processing of these gasses, intentional use within the trench, or leakage from nearby plumbing. These present an asphyxiation hazard and may also be toxic. Burnable gasses such as natural gas present a fire and explosion risk. Oxidizers such as pure oxygen increase the risk of fire from other fuels present in the trench. Gasses such as pure nitrogen and natural gas have densities similar to pure air but are denser when cold, for example when they have evaporated from liquid form, and may creep along the ground and fill the trench. Ventilation fans and ducts reduce the risk. Oxygen sensors and other gas sensors detect the danger; alarms from the sensors can warn the occupants.

<text>Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied lines largely comprising military trenches, in which combatants are well-protected from the enemy&#x27;s small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. It became archetypically associated with World War I (1914–1918), when the Race to the Sea rapidly expanded trench use on the Western Front starting in September 1914.

Trench warfare proliferated when a revolution in firepower was not matched by similar advances in mobility, resulting in a grueling form of warfare in which the defender held the advantage. On the Western Front in 1914–1918, both sides constructed elaborate trench, underground, and dugout systems opposing each other along a front, protected from assault by barbed wire. The area between opposing trench lines (known as &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;) was fully exposed to artillery fire from both sides. Attacks, even if successful, often sustained severe casualties.

The development of armoured warfare and combined arms tactics permitted static lines to be bypassed and defeated, leading to the decline of trench warfare after the war. Following World War I, &quot;trench warfare&quot; became a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges, and futility in conflict.

== Precursors ==
Field works have existed for as long as there have been armies. Roman legions, when in the presence of an enemy, entrenched camps nightly when on the move. The Roman general Belisarius had his soldiers dig a trench as part of the Battle of Dara in 530 AD.

Trench warfare was also documented during the defence of Medina in a siege known as the Battle of the Trench (627 AD). The architect of the plan was Salman the Persian who suggested digging a trench to defend Medina.

There are examples of trench digging as a defensive measure during the Middle Ages in Europe, such as during the Piedmontese Civil War, where it was documented that on the morning of May 12, 1640, the French soldiers, having already captured the left bank of the Po river and gaining control of the bridge connecting the two banks of the river, and wanting to advance to the Capuchin Monastery of the Monte, deciding that their position wasn&#x27;t secure enough for their liking, then choose to advance on a double attack on the trenches, but were twice repelled. Eventually, on the third attempt, the French broke through and the defenders were forced to flee with the civilian population, seeking the sanctuary of the local Catholic church, the Santa Maria al Monte dei Cappuccini, in Turin, also known at that time as the Capuchin Monastery of the Monte.

In early modern warfare, troops used field works to block possible lines of advance. Examples include the Lines of Stollhofen, built at the start of the War of the Spanish Succession of 1702–1714, the Lines of Weissenburg built under the orders of the Duke of Villars in 1706, the Lines of Ne Plus Ultra during the winter of 1710–1711, and the Lines of Torres Vedras in 1809 and 1810.

In the New Zealand Wars (1845–1872), the Māori developed elaborate trench and bunker systems as part of fortified areas known as pā, employing them successfully as early as the 1840s to withstand British artillery bombardments. According to one British observer, &quot;the fence round the pa is covered between every paling with loose bunches of flax, against which the bullets fall and drop; in the night they repair every hole made by the guns&quot;. These systems included firing trenches, communication trenches, tunnels, and anti-artillery bunkers. The Ngāpuhi pā Ruapekapeka is often considered to be the most sophisticated and technologically impressive by historians. British casualties, such as at Gate Pa in 1864 and the Battle of Ohaeawai in 1845, suggested that contemporary weaponry, such as muskets and cannon, proved insufficient to dislodge defenders from a trench system. There has been an academic debate surrounding this since the 1980s, when in his book &quot;The New Zealand Wars,&quot; historian James Belich claimed that Northern Māori had effectively invented trench warfare during the first stages of the New Zealand Wars. However, this has been criticised by a few academics of the same period, with Gavin McLean noting that while the Māori had certainly adapted pa to suit contemporary weaponry, many historians have dismissed Belich&#x27;s claim as &quot;baseless... revisionism&quot;. Others more recently have said that while it is clear the Māori did not invent trench warfare &quot;first&quot;—Māori did invent trench-based defences without any offshore aid— some believe they may have influenced 20th-century methods of trench design identified with it.

The Crimean War (1853–1856) saw &quot;massive trench works and trench warfare&quot;, even though &quot;the modernity of the trench war was not immediately apparent to the contemporaries&quot;.

Union and Confederate armies employed field works and extensive trench systems in the American Civil War (1861–1865) — most notably in the sieges of Vicksburg (1863) and Petersburg (1864–1865), the latter of which saw the first use by the Union Army of the rapid-fire Gatling gun, the important precursor to modern-day machine guns. Trenches were also utilized in the Paraguayan War (which started in 1864), the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902), and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905).

== Adoption ==


Although technology had dramatically changed the nature of warfare by 1914, the armies of the major combatants had not fully absorbed the implications. Fundamentally, as the range and rate of fire of rifled small-arms increased, a defender shielded from enemy fire (in a trench, at a house window, behind a large rock, or behind other cover) was often able to kill several approaching foes before they closed around the defender&#x27;s position. Attacks across open ground became even more dangerous after the introduction of rapid-firing artillery, exemplified by the &quot;French 75&quot;, and high explosive fragmentation rounds. The increases in firepower had outstripped the ability of infantry (or even cavalry) to cover the ground between firing lines, and the ability of armour to withstand fire. It would take a revolution in mobility to change that.

The French and German armies adopted different tactical doctrines: the French relied on the attack with speed and surprise, and the Germans relied on firepower, investing heavily in howitzers and machine guns. The British lacked an official tactical doctrine, with an officer corps that rejected theory in favour of pragmatism.

While the armies expected to use entrenchments and cover, they did not allow for the effect of defences in depth. They required a deliberate approach to seizing positions from which fire support could be given for the next phase of the attack, rather than a rapid move to break the enemy&#x27;s line. It was assumed that artillery could still destroy entrenched troops, or at least suppress them sufficiently for friendly infantry and cavalry to manoeuvre.

Digging-in when defending a position was a standard practice by the start of WWI. To attack frontally was to court crippling losses, so an outflanking operation was the preferred method of attack against an entrenched enemy. After the Battle of the Aisne in September 1914, an extended series of attempted flanking moves, and matching extensions to the fortified defensive lines, developed into the &quot;race to the sea&quot;, by the end of which German and Allied armies had produced a matched pair of trench lines from the Swiss border in the south to the North Sea coast of Belgium.

By the end of October 1914, the whole front in Belgium and France had solidified into lines of trenches, which lasted until the last weeks of the war. Mass infantry assaults were futile in the face of artillery fire, as well as rapid rifle and machine-gun fire. Both sides concentrated on breaking up enemy attacks and on protecting their own troops by digging deep into the ground. After the buildup of forces in 1915, the Western Front became a stalemated struggle between equals, to be decided by attrition. Frontal assaults, and their associated casualties, became inevitable because the continuous trench lines had no open flanks. Casualties of the defenders matched those of the attackers, as vast reserves were expended in costly counter-attacks or exposed to the attacker&#x27;s massed artillery. There were periods in which rigid trench warfare broke down, such as during the Battle of the Somme, but the lines never moved very far. The war would be won by the side that was able to commit the last reserves to the Western Front. Trench warfare prevailed on the Western Front until the Germans launched their Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918. Trench warfare also took place on other fronts, including in Italy and at Gallipoli.

Armies were also limited by logistics. The heavy use of artillery meant that ammunition expenditure was far higher in WWI than in any previous conflict. Horses and carts were insufficient for transporting large quantities over long distances, so armies had trouble moving far from railheads. This greatly slowed advances, making it impossible for either side to achieve a breakthrough that would change the war. This situation would only be altered in WWII with greater use of motorized vehicles.

== Construction ==

Early World War I trenches were simple. They lacked traverses, and according to pre-war doctrine were to be packed with men fighting shoulder to shoulder. This doctrine led to heavy casualties from artillery fire. This vulnerability, and the length of the front to be defended, soon led to frontline trenches being held by fewer men. The defenders augmented the trenches themselves with barbed wire strung in front to impede movement; wiring parties went out every night to repair and improve these forward defences.

The small, improvised trenches of the first few months grew deeper and more complex, gradually becoming vast areas of interlocking defensive works. They resisted both artillery bombardment and mass infantry assault. Shell-proof dugouts became a high priority.

A well-developed trench had to be at least deep to allow men to walk upright and still be protected.

There were three standard ways to dig a trench: entrenching, sapping, and tunneling. Entrenching, where a man would stand on the surface and dig downwards, was most efficient, as it allowed a large digging party to dig the full length of the trench simultaneously. However, entrenching left the diggers exposed above ground and hence could only be carried out when free of observation, such as in a rear area or at night. Sapping involved extending the trench by digging away at the end face. The diggers were not exposed, but only one or two men could work on the trench at a time. Tunnelling was like sapping except that a &quot;roof&quot; of soil was left in place while the trench line was established and then removed when the trench was ready to be occupied. The guidelines for British trench construction stated that it would take 450 men 6 hours at night to complete of front-line trench system. Thereafter, the trench would require constant maintenance to prevent deterioration caused by weather or shelling.

Trenchmen were a specialized unit of trench excavators and repairmen. They usually dug or repaired in groups of four with an escort of two armed soldiers. Trenchmen were armed with one 1911 semi-automatic pistol, and were only utilized when either a new trench needed to be dug or expanded quickly, or when a trench was destroyed by artillery fire. Trenchmen were trained to dig with incredible speed; in a dig of three to six hours they could accomplish what would take a normal group of frontline infantry soldiers around two days. Trenchmen were usually looked down upon by fellow soldiers because they did not fight. They were usually called cowards because if they were attacked while digging, they would abandon the post and flee to safety. They were instructed to do this though because through the war there were only around 1,100 trained trenchmen. They were highly valued only by officers higher on the chain of command.

=== Components ===
The banked earth on the lip of the trench facing the enemy was called the parapet and had a fire step. The embanked rear lip of the trench was called the parados, which protected the soldier&#x27;s back from shells falling behind the trench. The sides of the trench were often revetted with sandbags, wire mesh, wooden frames and sometimes roofs. The floor of the trench was usually covered by wooden duckboards. In later designs the floor might be raised on a wooden frame to provide a drainage channel underneath. Due to the substantial casualties taken from indirect fire, some trenches were reinforced with corrugated metal roofs over the top as an improvised defence from shrapnel.

The static movement of trench warfare and a need for protection from snipers created a requirement for loopholes both for discharging firearms and for observation. Often a steel plate was used with a &quot;keyhole&quot;, which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use. German snipers used armour-piercing bullets that allowed them to penetrate loopholes. Another means to see over the parapet was the trench periscope – in its simplest form, just a stick with two angled pieces of mirror at the top and bottom. A number of armies made use of the periscope rifle, which enabled soldiers to snipe at the enemy without exposing themselves over the parapet, although at the cost of reduced shooting accuracy. The device is most associated with Australian and New Zealand troops at Gallipoli, where the Turks held the high ground.
Dugouts of varying degrees of comfort were built in the rear of the support trench. British dugouts were usually deep. The Germans, who had based their knowledge on studies of the Russo-Japanese War, made something of a science out of designing and constructing defensive works. They used reinforced concrete to construct deep, shell-proof, ventilated dugouts, as well as strategic strongpoints. German dugouts were typically much deeper, usually a minimum of deep and sometimes dug three stories down, with concrete staircases to reach the upper levels.

=== Layout ===

Trenches were never straight but were dug in a zigzagging or stepped pattern, with all straight sections generally kept less than ten yards. Later, this evolved to have the combat trenches broken into distinct s connected by traverses. While this isolated the view of friendly soldiers along their own trench, this ensured the entire trench could not be enfiladed if the enemy gained access at any one point; or if a bomb, grenade, or shell landed in the trench, the blast could not travel far.
Very early in the war, British defensive doctrine suggested a main trench system of three parallel lines, interconnected by communications trenches. The point at which a communications trench intersected the front trench was of critical importance, and it was usually heavily fortified. The front trench was lightly garrisoned and typically occupied in force only during &quot;stand to&quot; at dawn and dusk. Between behind the front trench was located the support (or &quot;travel&quot;) trench, to which the garrison would retreat when the front trench was bombarded.

Between further to the rear was located the third reserve trench, where the reserve troops could amass for a counter-attack if the front trenches were captured. This defensive layout was soon rendered obsolete as the power of artillery grew; however, in certain sectors of the front, the support trench was maintained as a decoy to attract the enemy bombardment away from the front and reserve lines. Fires were lit in the support line to make it appear inhabited and any damage done immediately repaired.

Temporary trenches were also built. When a major attack was planned, assembly trenches would be dug near the front trench. These were used to provide a sheltered place for the waves of attacking troops who would follow the first waves leaving from the front trench. &quot;Saps&quot; were temporary, unmanned, often dead-end utility trenches dug out into no-man&#x27;s land. They fulfilled a variety of purposes, such as connecting the front trench to a listening post close to the enemy wire or providing an advance &quot;jumping-off&quot; line for a surprise attack. When one side&#x27;s front line bulged towards the opposition, a salient was formed. The concave trench line facing the salient was called a &quot;re-entrant.&quot; Large salients were perilous for their occupants because they could be assailed from three sides.

Behind the front system of trenches there were usually at least two more partially prepared trench systems, kilometres to the rear, ready to be occupied in the event of a retreat. The Germans often prepared multiple redundant trench systems; in 1916 their Somme front featured two complete trench systems, one kilometre apart, with a third partially completed system a further kilometre behind. This duplication made a decisive breakthrough virtually impossible. In the event that a section of the first trench system was captured, a &quot;switch&quot; trench would be dug to connect the second trench system to the still-held section of the first.

=== Wire ===
The use of lines of barbed wire, razor wire, and other wire obstacles, in belts deep or more, is effective in stalling infantry travelling across the battlefield. Although the barbs or razors might cause minor injuries, the purpose was to entangle the limbs of enemy soldiers, forcing them to stop and methodically pull or work the wire off, likely taking several seconds, or even longer. This is deadly when the wire is emplaced at points of maximum exposure to concentrated enemy firepower, in plain sight of enemy fire bays and machine guns. The combination of wire and firepower was the cause of most failed attacks in trench warfare and their very high casualties. Liddell Hart identified barbed wire and the machine gun as the elements that had to be broken to regain a mobile battlefield.

A basic wire line could be created by draping several strands of barbed wire between wooden posts driven into the ground. Loose lines of wire can be more effective in entangling than tight ones, and it was common to use the coils of barbed wire as delivered only partially stretched out, called concertina wire. Placing and repairing wire in no man&#x27;s land relied on stealth, usually done at night by special wiring parties, who could also be tasked with secretly sabotaging enemy wires. The screw picket, invented by the Germans and later adopted by the Allies during the war, was quieter than driving stakes. Wire often stretched the entire length of a battlefield&#x27;s trench line, in multiple lines, sometimes covering a depth or more.

Methods to defeat it were rudimentary. Prolonged artillery bombardment could damage them, but not reliably. The first soldier meeting the wire could jump onto the top of it, hopefully depressing it enough for those that followed to get over him; this still took at least one soldier out of action for each line of wire. In World War I, British and Commonwealth forces relied on wire cutters, which proved unable to cope with the heavier gauge German wire. The Bangalore torpedo was adopted by many armies, and continued in use past the end of World War II.

The barbed wire used differed between nations; the German wire was heavier gauge, and British wire cutters, designed for the thinner native product, were unable to cut it.

=== Geography ===

The confined, static, and subterranean nature of trench warfare resulted in it developing its own peculiar form of geography. In the forward zone, the conventional transport infrastructure of roads and rail were replaced by the network of trenches and trench railways. The critical advantage that could be gained by holding the high ground meant that minor hills and ridges gained enormous significance. Many slight hills and valleys were so subtle as to have been nameless until the front line encroached upon them. Some hills were named for their height in metres, such as Hill 60. A farmhouse, windmill, quarry, or copse of trees would become the focus of a determined struggle simply because it was the largest identifiable feature. However, it would not take the artillery long to obliterate it, so that thereafter it became just a name on a map.

The battlefield of Flanders presented numerous problems for the practice of trench warfare, especially for the Allied forces, mainly British and Canadians, who were often compelled to occupy the low ground. Heavy shelling quickly destroyed the network of ditches and water channels which had previously drained this low-lying area of Belgium. In most places, the water table was only a metre or so below the surface, meaning that any trench dug in the ground would quickly flood. Consequently, many &quot;trenches&quot; in Flanders were actually above ground and constructed from massive breastworks of sandbags filled with clay. Initially, both the parapet and parados of the trench were built in this way, but a later technique was to dispense with the parados for much of the trench line, thus exposing the rear of the trench to fire from the reserve line in case the front was breached.
In the Alps, trench warfare even stretched onto vertical slopes and deep into the mountains, to heights of above sea level. The Ortler had an artillery position on its summit near the front line. The trench-line management and trench profiles had to be adapted to the rough terrain, hard rock, and harsh weather conditions. Many trench systems were constructed within glaciers such as the Adamello-Presanella group or the famous city below the ice on the Marmolada in the Dolomites.

=== Observation ===
Observing the enemy in trench warfare was difficult, prompting the invention of technology such as the camouflage tree.

== No man&#x27;s land ==
The space between the opposing trenches was referred to as &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot; and varied in width depending on the battlefield. On the Western Front it was typically between , though only on Vimy Ridge.

After the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917, no man&#x27;s land stretched to over a kilometre in places. At the &quot;Quinn&#x27;s Post&quot; in the cramped confines of the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli, the opposing trenches were only apart and the soldiers in the trenches constantly threw hand grenades at each other. On the Eastern Front and in the Middle East, the areas to be covered were so vast, and the distances from the factories supplying shells, bullets, concrete and barbed wire so great, trench warfare in the West European style often did not occur.

== Weaponry ==

=== Infantry weapons and machine guns ===

At the start of the First World War, the standard infantry soldier&#x27;s primary weapons were the rifle and bayonet; other weapons got less attention. Especially for the British, what hand grenades were issued tended to be few in numbers and less effective. This emphasis began to shift as soon as trench warfare began; militaries rushed improved grenades into mass production, including rifle grenades.

The hand grenade came to be one of the primary infantry weapons of trench warfare. Both sides were quick to raise specialist grenadier groups. The grenade enabled a soldier to engage the enemy without exposing himself to fire, and it did not require precise accuracy to kill or maim. Another benefit was that if a soldier could get close enough to the trenches, enemies hiding in trenches could be attacked. The Germans and Turks were well equipped with grenades from the start of the war, but the British, who had ceased using grenadiers in the 1870s and did not anticipate a siege war, entered the conflict with virtually none, so soldiers had to improvise bombs with whatever was available (see Jam Tin Grenade). By late 1915, the British Mills bomb had entered wide circulation, and by the end of the war 75 million had been used.

Since the troops were often not adequately equipped for trench warfare, improvised weapons were common in the first encounters, such as short wooden clubs and metal maces, spears, hatchets, hammers, entrenching tools, as well as trench knives and brass knuckles. According to the semi-biographical war novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, many soldiers preferred to use a sharpened spade as an improvised melee weapon instead of the bayonet, as the bayonet tended to get &quot;stuck&quot; in stabbed opponents, rendering it useless in heated battle. The shorter length also made them easier to use in the confined quarters of the trenches. These tools could then be used to dig in after they had taken a trench. Modern military digging tools are as a rule designed to also function as a melee weapon. As the war progressed, better equipment was issued, and improvised arms were discarded.


A specialised group of fighters called &quot;trench sweepers&quot; (&quot;Nettoyeurs de Tranchées&quot; or &quot;Zigouilleurs&quot;) evolved to fight within the trenches. They cleared surviving enemy personnel from recently overrun trenches and made clandestine raids into enemy trenches to gather intelligence. Volunteers for this dangerous work were often exempted from participation in frontal assaults over open ground and from routine work like filling sandbags, draining trenches, and repairing barbed wire in no-man&#x27;s land. When allowed to choose their own weapons, many selected grenades, knives and pistols. FN M1900 pistols were highly regarded for this work, but never available in adequate quantities. Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless, Savage Model 1907, Star Bonifacio Echeverria and Ruby pistols were widely used.

Various mechanical devices were invented for throwing hand grenades into enemy trenches. The Germans used the &quot;Wurfmaschine&quot;, a spring-powered device for throwing a hand grenade about . The French responded with the &quot;Sauterelle&quot; and the British with the Leach Trench Catapult and West Spring Gun which had varying degrees of success and accuracy. By 1916, catapult weapons were largely replaced by rifle grenades and mortars.

The Germans employed &quot;Flammenwerfer&quot; (flamethrowers) during the war for the first time against the French on 25 June 1915, then against the British 30 July in Hooge. The technology was in its infancy, and use was not very common until the end of 1917 when portability and reliability were improved. It was used in more than 300 documented battles. By 1918, it became a weapon of choice for &quot;Stoßtruppen&quot; (stormtroopers) with a team of six &quot;Pioniere&quot; (combat engineers) per squad.

Used by American soldiers in the Western front, the pump action shotguns was a formidable weapon in short range combat, enough so that Germany lodged a formal protest against their use on 14 September 1918, stating &quot;every prisoner found to have in his possession such guns or ammunition belonging thereto forfeits his life&quot;, though this threat was apparently never carried out. The U.S. military began to issue models specially modified for combat, called &quot;trench guns&quot;, with shorter barrels, higher capacity magazines, no choke, and often heat shields around the barrel, as well as lugs for the M1917 bayonet. Anzac and some British soldiers were also known to use sawed-off shotguns in trench raids, because of their portability, effectiveness at close range, and ease of use in the confines of a trench. This practice was not officially sanctioned, and the shotguns used were invariably modified sporting guns.

The Germans embraced the machine gun from the outset—in 1904, sixteen units were equipped with the &#x27;Maschinengewehr&#x27;—and the machine gun crews were the elite infantry units; these units were attached to Jaeger (light infantry) battalions. By 1914, British infantry units were armed with two Vickers machine guns per battalion; the Germans had six per battalion, and the Russians eight. It would not be until 1917 that every infantry unit of the American forces carried at least one machine gun. After 1915, the Maschinengewehr 08 was the standard issue German machine gun; its number &quot;08/15&quot; entered the German language as idiomatic for &quot;dead plain&quot;. At Gallipoli and in Palestine the Turks provided the infantry, but it was usually Germans who manned the machine guns.

The British High Command were less enthusiastic about machine guns, supposedly considering the weapon too &quot;unsporting&quot; and encouraging defensive fighting; and they lagged behind the Germans in adopting it. Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig is quoted as saying in 1915, &quot;The machine gun is a much overrated weapon; two per battalion is more than sufficient&quot;. The defensive firepower of the machine gun was exemplified during the first day of the Battle of the Somme when 60,000 British soldiers were rendered casualties, &quot;the great majority lost under withering machine gun fire&quot;. In 1915 the Machine Gun Corps was formed to train and provide sufficient heavy machine gun teams.

It was the Canadians that made the best practice, pioneering area denial and indirect fire (soon adopted by all Allied armies) under the guidance of former French Army Reserve officer Major General Raymond Brutinel. Minutes before the attack on Vimy Ridge the Canadians thickened the artillery barrage by aiming machine guns indirectly to deliver plunging fire on the Germans. They also significantly increased the number of machine guns per battalion. To match demand, production of the Vickers machine gun was contracted to firms in the United States. By 1917, every company in the British forces were also equipped with four Lewis light machine guns, which significantly enhanced their firepower.

The heavy machine gun was a specialist weapon, and in a static trench system was employed in a scientific manner, with carefully calculated fields of fire, so that at a moment&#x27;s notice an accurate burst could be fired at the enemy&#x27;s parapet or a break in the wire. Equally it could be used as light artillery in bombarding distant trenches. Heavy machine guns required teams of up to eight men to move them, maintain them, and keep them supplied with ammunition. This made them impractical for offensive manoeuvres, contributing to the stalemate on the Western Front.

One machine gun nest was theoretically able to mow down hundreds of enemies charging in the open through no man&#x27;s land.
However, while WWI machine guns were able to shoot hundreds of rounds per minute in theory, they were still prone to overheating and jamming, which often necessitated firing in short bursts. However, their potential was increased significantly when emplaced behind multiple lines of barbed wire to slow any advancing enemy.

In 1917 and 1918, new types of weapons were fielded. They changed the face of warfare tactics and were later employed during World War II.

The French introduced the CSRG 1915 Chauchat during Spring 1916 around the concept of &quot;walking fire&quot;, employed in 1918 when 250,000 weapons were fielded. More than 80,000 of the best shooters received the semi-automatic RSC 1917 rifle, allowing them to rapid fire at waves of attacking soldiers. Firing ports were installed in the newly arrived Renault FT tanks.

The French Army fielded a ground version of the Hotchkiss Canon de 37 mm used by the French Navy. It was primarily used to destroy German machine gun nests and concrete reinforced pillboxes with high explosive and armour-piercing rounds.

A new type of machine gun was introduced in 1916. Initially an aircraft weapon, the Bergmann LMG 15 was modified for ground use, with the later dedicated ground version being the LMG 15 n. A. It was used as an infantry weapon on all European and Middle Eastern fronts until the end of World War I. It later inspired the MG 30 and the MG 34 as well as the concept of the general-purpose machine gun.

What became known as the submachine gun had its genesis in World War I, developed around the concepts of infiltration and fire and movement, specifically to clear trenches of enemy soldiers when engagements were unlikely to occur beyond a range of a few feet. The MP 18 was the first practical submachine gun used in combat. It was fielded in 1918 by the German Army as the primary weapon of the stormtroopers – assault groups that specialised in trench combat. Around the same time, the Italians had developed the Beretta M1918 submachine gun, based on a design from earlier in the war.

=== Artillery ===
Artillery dominated the battlefields of trench warfare. An infantry attack was rarely successful if it advanced beyond the range of its supporting artillery. In addition to bombarding the enemy infantry in the trenches, the artillery could be used to precede infantry advances with a creeping barrage, or engage in counter-battery duels to try to destroy the enemy&#x27;s guns. Artillery mainly fired fragmentation, high-explosive, shrapnel or, later in the war, gas shells. The British experimented with firing thermite incendiary shells, to set trees and ruins alight. However, all armies experienced shell shortages during the first year or two of World War I, due to underestimating their usage in intensive combat. This knowledge had been gained by the combatant nations in the Russo-Japanese War, when daily artillery fire consumed ten times more than daily factory output, but had not been applied.

Artillery pieces were of two types: infantry support guns and howitzers. Guns fired high-velocity shells over a flat trajectory and were often used to deliver fragmentation and to cut barbed wire. Howitzers lofted the shell over a high trajectory so it plunged into the ground. The largest calibers were usually howitzers. The German howitzer weighed 20 tons and could fire a one-ton shell over . A critical feature of period artillery pieces was the hydraulic recoil mechanism, which meant the gun did not need to be re-aimed after each shot, permitting a tremendous increase in rate of fire.

Initially each gun would need to register its aim on a known target, in view of an observer, in order to fire with precision during a battle. The process of gun registration would often alert the enemy an attack was being planned. Towards the end of 1917, artillery techniques were developed enabling fire to be delivered accurately without registration on the battlefield—the gun registration was done behind the lines then the pre-registered guns were brought up to the front for a surprise attack.

Mortars, which lobbed a shell in a high arc over a relatively short distance, were widely used in trench fighting for harassing the forward trenches, for cutting wire in preparation for a raid or attack, and for destroying dugouts, saps and other entrenchments. In 1914, the British fired a total of 545 mortar shells; in 1916, they fired over 6,500,000. Similarly, howitzers, which fire on a more direct arc than mortars, raised in number from over 1,000 shells in 1914, to over 4,500,000 in 1916. The smaller numerical difference in mortar rounds, as opposed to howitzer rounds, is presumed by many to be related to the expanded costs of manufacturing the larger and more resource intensive howitzer rounds.

The main British mortar was the Stokes, a precursor of the modern mortar. It was a light mortar, simple in operation, and capable of a rapid rate of fire by virtue of the propellant cartridge being attached to the base shell. To fire the Stokes mortar, the round was simply dropped into the tube, where the percussion cartridge was detonated when it struck the firing pin at the bottom of the barrel, thus being launched. The Germans used a range of mortars. The smallest were grenade-throwers (&#x27;Granatenwerfer&#x27;) which fired the stick grenades which were commonly used. Their medium trench-mortars were called mine-throwers (&#x27;Minenwerfer&#x27;). The heavy mortar was called the &#x27;Ladungswerfer&#x27;, which threw &quot;aerial torpedoes&quot;, containing a charge to a range of . The flight of the missile was so slow and leisurely that men on the receiving end could make some attempt to seek shelter.

Mortars had certain advantages over artillery such as being much more portable and the ability to fire without leaving the relative safety of trenches. Moreover, mortars were able to fire directly into the trenches, which was hard to do with artillery.

== Strategy and tactics ==
The fundamental strategy of trench warfare in World War I was to defend one&#x27;s own position strongly while trying to achieve a breakthrough into the enemy&#x27;s rear. The effect was to end up in attrition, the process of progressively grinding down the opposition&#x27;s resources until, ultimately, they are no longer able to wage war. This did not prevent the ambitious commander from pursuing the strategy of annihilation—the ideal of an offensive battle which produces victory in one decisive engagement.

The Commander in Chief of the British forces during most of World War I, General Douglas Haig, was constantly seeking a &quot;breakthrough&quot; which could then be exploited with cavalry divisions. His major trench offensives—the Somme in 1916 and Flanders in 1917—were conceived as breakthrough battles but both degenerated into costly attrition. The Germans actively pursued a strategy of attrition in the Battle of Verdun, the sole purpose of which was to &quot;bleed the French Army white&quot;. At the same time the Allies needed to mount offensives in order to draw attention away from other hard-pressed areas of the line.

The popular image of a trench assault is of a wave of soldiers, bayonets fixed, going &quot;over the top&quot; and marching in a line across no man&#x27;s land into a hail of enemy fire. This was the standard method early in the war; it was rarely successful. More common was an attack at night from an advanced post in no man&#x27;s land, having cut the barbed wire beforehand. In 1915, the Germans innovated with infiltration tactics where small groups of highly trained and well-equipped troops would attack vulnerable points and bypass strong points, driving deep into the rear areas. The distance they could advance was still limited by their ability to supply and communicate.

The role of artillery in an infantry attack was twofold. The first aim of a bombardment was to prepare the ground for an infantry assault, killing or demoralising the enemy garrison and destroying their defences. The duration of these initial bombardments varied, from seconds to days. Artillery bombardments prior to infantry assaults were often ineffective at destroying enemy defences, only serving to provide advance notice of an attack. The British bombardment that began the Battle of the Somme lasted eight days but did little damage to either the German barbed wire or their deep dug-outs, where defenders were able to wait out the bombardment in relative safety.

Once the guns stopped, the defenders had time to emerge and were usually ready for the attacking infantry. The second aim was to protect the attacking infantry by providing an impenetrable &quot;barrage&quot; or curtain of shells to prevent an enemy counter-attack. The first attempt at sophistication was the &quot;lifting barrage&quot; where the first objective of an attack was intensely bombarded for a period before the entire barrage &quot;lifted&quot; to fall on a second objective farther back. However, this usually expected too much of the infantry, and the usual outcome was that the barrage would outpace the attackers, leaving them without protection.

This resulted in the use of the &quot;creeping barrage&quot; which would lift more frequently but in smaller steps, sweeping the ground ahead and moving so slowly that the attackers could usually follow closely behind it. This became the standard method of attack from late 1916 onward. The main benefit of the barrage was suppression of the enemy rather than to cause casualties or material damage.

Capturing the objective was half the battle, but the battle was won only if the objective was held. The attacking force would have to advance with not only the weapons required to capture a trench but also the tools—sandbags, picks and shovels, barbed wire—to fortify and defend from counter-attack. A successful advance would take the attackers beyond the range of their own field artillery, making them vulnerable, and it took time to move guns up over broken ground. The Germans placed great emphasis on immediately counter-attacking to regain lost ground. This strategy cost them dearly in 1917 when the British started to limit their advances so as to be able to meet the anticipated counter-attack from a position of strength. Part of the British artillery was positioned close behind the original start line and took no part in the initial bombardment, so as to be ready to support later phases of the operation while other guns were moved up.

The Germans were the first to apply the concept of &quot;defence in depth&quot;, where the front-line zone was hundreds of metres deep and contained a series of redoubts rather than a continuous trench. Each redoubt could provide supporting fire to its neighbours, and while the attackers had freedom of movement between the redoubts, they would be subjected to withering enfilade fire. They were also more willing than their opponents to make a strategic withdrawal to a superior prepared defensive position. The British eventually adopted a similar approach, but it was incompletely implemented when the Germans launched the 1918 Spring Offensive and proved disastrously ineffective. France, by contrast, relied on artillery and reserves, not entrenchment.

== Life in the trenches ==
An individual unit&#x27;s time in a front-line trench was usually brief; from as little as one day to as much as two weeks at a time before being relieved. The 31st Australian Battalion once spent 53 days in the line at Villers-Bretonneux, but such a duration was a rare exception. The 10th Battalion, CEF, averaged frontline tours of six days in 1915 and 1916.
The units who manned the frontline trenches the longest were the Portuguese Expeditionary Corps from Portugal stationed in Northern France; unlike the other allies the Portuguese couldn&#x27;t rotate units from the front lines due to lack of reinforcements sent from Portugal, nor could they replace the depleted units that lost manpower due to the war of attrition. With this rate of casualties and no reinforcements forthcoming, most of the men were denied leave and had to serve long periods in the trenches with some units spending up to six consecutive months in the front line with little to no leave during that time.

On an individual level, a typical British soldier&#x27;s year could be divided as follows:

*15% front line
*10% support line
*30% reserve line
*20% rest
*25% other (hospital, travelling, leave, training courses, etc.)

Even when in the front line, the typical battalion would be called upon to engage in fighting only a handful of times a year; making an attack, defending against an attack or participating in a raid. The frequency of combat would increase for the units of the &quot;elite&quot; fighting divisions; on the Allied side, these were the British regular divisions, the Canadian Corps, the French XX Corps, and the Anzacs.

Some sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, making life in the trenches comparatively easy. When the I Anzac Corps first arrived in France in April 1916 after the evacuation of Gallipoli, they were sent to a relatively peaceful sector south of Armentières to &quot;acclimatise&quot;. In contrast, some other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. On the Western Front, Ypres was invariably hellish, especially for the British in the exposed, overlooked salient. However, even quiet sectors amassed daily casualties through sniper fire, artillery, disease, and poison gas. In the first six months of 1916, before the launch of the Somme Offensive, the British did not engage in any significant battles on their sector of the Western Front and yet suffered 107,776 casualties.

A sector of the front would be allocated to an army corps, usually comprising three divisions. Two divisions would occupy adjacent sections of the front, and the third would be in rest to the rear. This breakdown of duty would continue down through the army structure, so that within each front-line division, typically comprising three infantry brigades (regiments for the Germans), two brigades would occupy the front and the third would be in reserve. Within each front-line brigade, typically comprising four battalions, two battalions would occupy the front with two in reserve, and so on for companies and platoons. The lower down the structure this division of duty proceeded, the more frequently the units would rotate from front-line duty to support or reserve.
During the day, snipers and artillery observers in balloons made movement perilous, so the trenches were mostly quiet. It was during these daytime hours that the soldiers would amuse themselves with trench magazines. Because of the peril associated with daytime activities, trenches were busiest at night when the cover of darkness allowed movement of troops and supplies, the maintenance and expansion of the barbed wire and trench system, and reconnaissance of the enemy&#x27;s defences. Sentries in listening posts out in no man&#x27;s land would try to detect enemy patrols and working parties, or indications that an attack was being prepared.

Pioneered by the Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry in February 1915, trench raids were carried out in order to capture prisoners and &quot;booty&quot;—letters and other documents to provide intelligence about the unit occupying the opposing trenches. As the war progressed, raiding became part of the general British policy, the intention being to maintain the fighting spirit of the troops and to deny no man&#x27;s land to the Germans. As well, they were intended to compel the enemy to reinforce, which exposed their troops to artillery fire.

Such dominance was achieved at a high cost when the enemy replied with their own artillery, and a post-war British analysis concluded the benefits were probably not worth the cost. Early in the war, surprise raids would be mounted, particularly by the Canadians, but increased vigilance made achieving surprise difficult as the war progressed. By 1916, raids were carefully planned exercises in combined arms and involved close co-operation between infantry and artillery.

A raid would begin with an intense artillery bombardment designed to drive off or kill the front-trench garrison and cut the barbed wire. Then the bombardment would shift to form a &quot;box barrage&quot;, or cordon, around a section of the front line to prevent a counter-attack intercepting the raid. However, the bombardment also had the effect of notifying the enemy of the location of the planned attack, thus allowing reinforcements to be called in from wider sectors.

== Dangers ==


Approximately 10–15 percent of all soldiers who fought in the First World War died as a result.

While the main cause of death in the trenches came from shelling and gunfire, diseases and infections were always present, and became prevalent for all sides as the war progressed. Medical procedures, while considerably more effective than at any previous time in history, were still not very helpful; antibiotics had not yet been discovered or invented. As a result, an infection caught in a trench often went untreated and could fester until the soldier died.

=== Injuries ===

The main killer in the trenches was artillery fire; around 75 percent of known casualties. Even if a soldier was not hit directly by the artillery, shell fragments and debris had a high chance of wounding those in close proximity to the blast. Artillery use increased tremendously during the war; for example, the percentage of the French army that was artillerymen grew from 20 percent in 1914 to 38 percent by 1918. The second largest contributor to death was gunfire (bullets from rifles and machine-guns), which was responsible for 34 per cent of French military casualties.

Once the war entered the static phase of trench warfare, the number of lethal head wounds that troops were receiving from fragmentation increased dramatically. The French were the first to see a need for greater protection and began to introduce steel helmets in the summer of 1915. The Adrian helmet replaced the traditional French kepi and was later adopted by the Belgian, Italian and many other armies. At about the same time the British were developing their own helmets. The French design was rejected as not strong enough and too difficult to mass-produce. The design that was eventually approved by the British was the Brodie helmet. This had a wide brim to protect the wearer from falling objects, but offered less protection to the wearer&#x27;s neck. When the Americans entered the war, this was the helmet they chose, though some units used the French Adrian helmet.

=== Disease ===

The predominant disease in the trenches of the Western Front was trench fever. Trench fever was a common disease spread through the faeces of body lice, which were rampant in trenches. Trench fever caused headaches, shin pain, splenomegaly, rashes and relapsing fevers – resulting in lethargy for months. First reported on the Western Front in 1915 by a British medical officer, additional cases of trench fever became increasingly common mostly in the frontline troops. In 1921, microbiologist Sir David Bruce reported that over one million Allied soldiers were infected by trench fever throughout the war. Even after the Great War had ended, disabled veterans in Britain attributed their decreasing quality of life to trench fever they had sustained during wartime.

Early in the war, gas gangrene commonly developed in major wounds, in part because the &quot;Clostridium&quot; bacteria responsible are ubiquitous in manure-fertilized soil (common in western European agriculture, such as France and Belgium), and dirt would often get into a wound (or be rammed in by shrapnel, explosion, or bullet). In 1914, 12% of wounded British soldiers developed gas gangrene, and at least 100,000 German soldiers died directly from the infection. After rapid advances in medical procedures and practices, the incidence of gas gangrene fell to 1% by 1918.

Entrenched soldiers also carried many intestinal parasites, such as ascariasis, trichuriasis and tapeworm. These parasites were common amongst soldiers, and spread amongst them, due to the unhygienic environment created by the common trench, where there were no true sewage management procedures. This ensured that parasites (and diseases) would spread onto rations and food sources that would then be eaten by other soldiers.

Trench foot was a common environmental ailment affecting many soldiers, especially during the winter. It is one of several immersion foot syndromes. It was characterized by numbness and pain in the feet, but in bad cases could result in necrosis of the lower limbs. Trench foot was a large problem for the Allied forces, resulting in 75,000 British and 2,000 American casualties. Mandatory routine (daily or more often) foot inspections by fellow soldiers, along with systematic use of soap, foot powder, and changing socks, greatly reduced cases of trench foot. In 1918, US infantry were issued with an improved and more waterproof &#x27;Pershing boot&#x27; in an attempt to reduce casualties from trench foot.

To the surprise of medical professionals at the time, there was no outbreak of typhus in the trenches of the Western Front, despite the cold and harsh conditions being perfect for the reproduction of body lice that transmit the disease. However, on the Eastern Front an epidemic of typhus claimed between 150,000 – 200,000 lives in Serbia. Russia also suffered a globally unprecedented typhus epidemic during the last two years of the conflict that was exacerbated by harsh winters. This outbreak resulted in approximately 2.5 million recorded deaths, 100,000 of them being Red Army soldiers. Symptoms of typhus include a characteristic spotted rash (which was not always present), severe headache, sustained high fever of 39 °C (102 °F), cough, severe muscle pain, chills, falling blood pressure, stupor, sensitivity to light, and delirium; 10% to 60% die. Typhus is spread by body lice.

=== Trench rats ===

The trenches were inhabited by millions of rats which were often responsible for the spread of diseases. Soldiers&#x27; attempts to cull hordes of trench rats with rifle bayonets were common early in the war, but the rats reproduced faster than they could be slaughtered. However, soldiers still partook in rat hunts as a form of entertainment. Rats would feed on half-eaten or uneaten rations as well as corpses. Many soldiers were more afraid of rats than other horrors found in the trenches.

=== Psychological impact ===

Nervous and mental breakdowns amongst soldiers were common, due to unrelenting shellfire and the claustrophobic trench environment. Men who suffered such intense breakdowns were often rendered completely immobile, and were often seen cowering low in the trenches, unable even to perform instinctive human responses such as running away or fighting back. This condition came to be known as &quot;shell shock&quot;, &quot;war neurosis&quot; or &quot;battle hypnosis&quot;. Although trenches provided cover from shelling and small-arms fire, they also amplified the psychological effects of shell shock, as there was no way to escape a trench if shellfire was coming. If a soldier became too debilitated from shell shock, they were evacuated from the trench and hospitalized if possible. In some cases, shell shocked soldiers were executed for &quot;cowardice&quot; by their commanders as they became a liability. This was often done by a firing squad composed of their fellow soldiers – often from the same unit. Only years later would it be understood that such men were suffering from shell shock. During the war, 306 British soldiers were officially executed by their own side.

== Circumvention ==

Throughout World War I, the major combatants slowly developed different ways of breaking the stalemate of trench warfare; the Germans focused more on new tactics while the British and French focused on tanks.

=== Infiltration tactics ===
As far back as the 18th century, Prussian military doctrine (&quot;Vernichtungsgedanke&quot;) stressed manoeuvre and force concentration to achieve a decisive battle. The German military searched for ways to apply this in the face of trench warfare. Experiments with new tactics by Willy Rohr, a Prussian captain serving in the Vosges mountains in 1915, got the attention of the Minister of War. These tactics carried Prussian military doctrine down to smallest units — specially trained troops manoeuvred and massed to assault positions they chose on their own. During the next two years the German army tried to establish special stormtrooper detachments in all its units by sending selected men to Rohr and have those men then train their comrades in their original units.

Similar tactics were developed independently in other countries, such as French Army captain in 1915 and Russian general Aleksei Brusilov in 1916, but these failed to be adopted as any military doctrine.

The German stormtrooper methods involved men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down covering fire for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, intended to achieve surprise by disrupting entrenched enemy positions, aimed to bypass strongpoints and to attack the weakest parts of an enemy&#x27;s line. Additionally, they acknowledged the futility of managing a grand detailed plan of operations from afar, opting instead for junior officers on the spot to exercise initiative.

The Germans employed and improved infiltration tactics in a series of smaller to larger battles, each increasingly successful, leading up to the Battle of Caporetto against the Italians in 1917, and finally the massive German spring offensive in 1918 against the British and French. German infiltration tactics are sometimes called &quot;Hutier tactics&quot; by others, after Oskar von Hutier, the general leading the German 18th Army, which had the farthest advance in that offensive. After a stunningly rapid advance, the offensive failed to achieve a breakthrough; German forces stalled after outrunning their supply, artillery, and reinforcements, which could not catch up over the shell-torn ground left ruined by Allied attacks in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The exhausted German forces were soon pushed back in the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, and the Germans were unable to organise another major offensive before the war&#x27;s end. In post-war years, other nations did not fully appreciate these German tactical innovations amidst the overall German defeat.

=== Mining ===


Mines – tunnels under enemy lines packed with explosives and detonated – were widely used in WWI to destroy or disrupt enemy&#x27;s trench lines. Mining and counter-mining became a major part of trench warfare.

The dry chalk of the Somme was especially suited to mining, but with the aid of pumps, it was also possible to mine in the sodden clay of Flanders. Specialist tunneling companies, usually made up of men who had been miners in civilian life, would dig tunnels under no man&#x27;s land and beneath the enemy&#x27;s trenches. These mines would then be packed with explosives and detonated, producing a large crater. The crater served two purposes: it could destroy or breach the enemy&#x27;s trench and, by virtue of the raised lip that they produced, could provide a ready-made &quot;trench&quot; closer to the enemy&#x27;s line. When a mine was detonated, both sides would race to occupy and fortify the crater.

If the miners detected an enemy tunnel in progress, they would often counter-mine and try to drive a tunnel under the enemy&#x27;s tunnel in which they would detonate explosives to create a camouflet to destroy the enemy&#x27;s tunnel. Night raids were also conducted with the sole purpose of destroying the enemy&#x27;s mine workings. On occasion, mines would cross and fighting would occur underground. The mining skills could also be used to move troops unseen. On one occasion a whole British division was moved through interconnected workings and sewers without German observation. The British detonated 19 mines of varying sizes on July 1, 1916, the first day of the Battle of the Somme. The largest mines—the Y Sap Mine and the Lochnagar Mine—each containing 24 tons of explosives, were blown near La Boiselle, throwing earth into the air.

At 3.10 on June 7, 1917, a series of mines was detonated by the British to launch the Battle of Messines. The average mine contained 21 tons of explosive and the largest, beneath Saint-Eloi, was twice the average at 42 tons. As remarked by General Plumer to his staff the evening before the attack:

:&quot;Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography.&quot;

The craters from these and many other mines on the Western Front are still visible today. Two undetonated mines remained in the ground near Messines, with their location mislaid after the war. One blew during a thunderstorm in 1955; the other remains in the ground. Significant mining operations were also carried out on the Italian Front.

=== Gas ===

World War I saw large-scale use of poison gases. At the start of the war, the gas agents used were relatively weak and delivery unreliable, but by mid-war advances in this chemical warfare reached horrifying levels.

The first methods of employing gas was by releasing it from a cylinder when the wind was favourable. This was prone to miscarry if the direction of the wind was misjudged. Also, the cylinders needed to be positioned in the front trenches where they were likely to be ruptured by enemy bombardment. Later, gas was delivered directly to enemy trenches by artillery or mortar shell, reducing friendly casualties significantly. Lingering agents could still affect friendly troops that advanced to enemy trenches following its use.

Early on, soldiers made improvised gas masks by urinating on a handkerchief and putting it over their nose and mouth so the urea would disable the poison. Armies rushed to issue regulation gas masks as regular equipment for front line troops. Anti-gas equipment and procedures improved significantly during the war, to the point that gas attacks had become less devastating at the war&#x27;s end.

Several different gas agents were used. Tear gas was first employed in August 1914 by the French, but this could only temporarily disable the enemy. In April 1915, chlorine gas was first used by Germany at the Second Battle of Ypres. Exposure to a large dose could kill, and those not killed could suffer permanent lung damage. But the gas was easy to detect by scent and sight. Phosgene, first used in December 1915, was the most lethal killing gas of World War I; it was 18 times more powerful than chlorine and much more difficult to detect.

However, the most effective gas was mustard gas, introduced by Germany in July 1917. Mustard gas was not as fatal as phosgene, but it was hard to detect and lingered on the surface of the battlefield, so could inflict casualties over a long period. Even if not inhaled, it could slowly burn the skin, but quickly burned via the eyes or any wounds, causing blindness and intense suffering. Mustard gas also had the property of being heavier than air, causing it to sink down hills and therefore down into trenches. Casualties from mustard gas were unlikely to be fit to fight again, yet only 2% of mustard gas casualties died. The added burden of long-term care of casualties from mustard gas actually increased its overall effectiveness compared to more immediately lethal gas agents.

===Tanks===


Tanks were developed by the British and French as a means to attack enemy trenches, by combining heavy firepower (machine guns or light artillery guns), protection from small-arms fire (armour), and battlefield mobility (tracks). The British tanks were designed with a rhomboid shape, to easily surmount barbed wire and other obstacles. They were first deployed in 1916 at the Battle of the Somme in limited numbers, proving unreliable and ineffective at first, as mechanical and logistical issues overshadowed implementing a coherent tank doctrine, with the additional challenge of traversing ground torn apart by years of shell fire. At the First Battle of Cambrai in 1917, improved tanks in larger numbers demonstrated the potential of tank warfare, though German improvised anti-tank tactics, including using direct fire from field artillery, also proved effective.

By 1918, tank capabilities and tactics improved, their numbers increased and, combined with French tanks, finally helped break the stalemate. During the last 100 days of the war, Allied forces harried the Germans back using infantry supported by tanks and by close air support. By the war&#x27;s end, tanks become a significant element of warfare; the proposed British Plan 1919 would have employed tanks as a primary factor in military strategy. However, the impact of tanks in World War I was less than it could have been, due to their late introduction and the inherent issues that plague implementing revolutionary technology. The introduction of the tanks would mark the beginning of the end of trench warfare.

Between the two world wars many nations developed their own unique tanks and divergent theories of tank tactics, including the UK, France, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Japan, the US, and Italy. Though German tank development was restricted by the terms of the treaty ending World War I, Germany successfully combined their own tanks (plus Czech tanks from occupied Czechoslovakia) with infiltration tactics to produce blitzkrieg during World War II.

== Later use ==


=== Spanish Civil War ===
Trenches were often used in both sides particularly the Nationalists whose military ground doctrine emphasized static defence. The Republicans also employed the use of trenches, but also human wave attacks most notably during their defence of Casa de Campo in the Siege of Madrid.

=== World War II ===
In the decade leading up to World War II, the French built the Maginot Line, based on their experience with trench warfare in World War I. The Maginot Line was an extensive state-of-the-art defensive system far superior to any previous trench system: a chain of massive constructions of concrete, iron, and steel fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, linked by tunnel networks. It covered the length of the Franco-German border and was wide. It was supported by numerous underground barracks, shelters, ammunition dumps and depots, with its own telephone network and narrow gauge railways with armoured locomotives, backed up with heavy rail artillery. French military experts placed high value on the line, saying it would curb German aggression, as any invasion force would be halted long enough for French forces to mobilize and counterattack. Furthermore, French military planning during the inter-war period believed that the line would force the Germans to invade Belgium. This would allow any future conflict to take place off of French soil. By bypassing the Maginot Line and fighting the Belgian Army, it would allow the French military to move its best formations to counter. In the Battle of France, Germany invaded Belgium and the best Anglo-French forces moved to meet them as planned. However, the Germans had only recently changed their plans from what the French had anticipated would happen. Instead of an attack through central Belgium, the main German attack was delivered through the Ardennes forest. Inter-war French planning believed it would take the Germans 9 days to move forces through this area, and that it could be held by small forces. The German forces outpaced expectations and soon crossed into France between the main French forces and the Maginot Line. They then advanced towards the English Channel, and surrounded the Anglo-French armies. Small secondary German attacks concentrated at a few points in the Line had mixed success. The bulk of the Maginot Line was untouched, its garrisons withdrawn, and flanked. Due to the lack of combat, much of it has survived.

The return of mobile warfare in World War II reduced the emphasis of trench warfare, as defenders commonly lacked the time to build up such battlefield defences before they were forced to redeploy, due to the more rapidly-changing strategic situation. But trench systems were still effective, wherever mobility was limited, the front lines were static, or around known critical objectives that could not be bypassed. More quickly improvised defensive fighting positions, using &quot;scrapes&quot; or &quot;foxholes&quot;, that can be supplemented by sand bags, local materials, debris, or rubble, remain in common use. These are typically improved and expanded by the defenders, eventually becoming full trench systems, if given enough time and resources.

In the Winter War, the Mannerheim Line was a system of flexible field fortification for the defending Finns. While having very few bunkers and artillery compared to heavy defence lines like the Maginot Line, it allowed defensive platoons to regroup between field fortifications (wood-earth firing posts, dugouts and pillboxes) instead of locking them into bunkers, while forcing the invaders to attack trenches as in World War I without armor and direct fire support. It caused heavy losses to the Soviets and repelled them for two months.


At the Battle of Sevastopol, Red Army forces successfully held trench systems on the narrow peninsula for several months against intense German bombardment. The Western Allies in 1944 broke through the incomplete Atlantic Wall with relative ease through a combination of amphibious landings, naval gunfire, air attack, and airborne landings. Combined arms tactics where infantry, artillery, armour and aircraft cooperate closely greatly reduced the importance of trench warfare. It was, however, still a valuable method for reinforcing natural boundaries and creating a line of defence. For example, at the Battle of Stalingrad, soldiers on both sides dug trenches within the ruins; as well in the Battle of Hurtgen Forest, both American and German soldiers also dug trenches and foxholes in the rugged woods of the forest which led to continuous stalemates and failed offensives that lasted for months, which was reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The Battle of the Scheldt, due to the geography of the battle field greatly involved the use of trench warfare. In addition, before the start of the Battle of Kursk, the Soviets constructed a system of defence more elaborate than any they built during World War I. These defences succeeded in stopping the German armoured pincers from meeting and enveloping the salient.

The Italian Campaign fought from 1943 until the end of the war in Europe largely consisted of the Allies storming strongly fortified German lines which stretched from one coast, over the mountains to the other coast. When the Allies broke through one line, the Germans would retreat up the peninsula to yet another freshly prepared fortified line.
At the start of the Battle of Berlin, the last major assault on Germany, the Soviets attacked over the river Oder against German troops dug in on the Seelow Heights, about east of Berlin. Entrenchment allowed the Germans, who were massively outnumbered, to survive a bombardment from the largest concentration of artillery in history; as the Red Army attempted to cross the marshy riverside terrain they lost tens of thousands of casualties to the entrenched Germans before breaking through.

During the Pacific War, the Japanese used a labyrinth of underground fixed positions to slow down the Allied advances on many Pacific Islands. The Japanese built fixed fortifications on Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and Peleliu using a system of tunnels to interconnect their fortified positions. Many of these were former mine shafts that were turned into defence positions. Engineers added sliding armored steel doors with multiple openings to serve both artillery and machine guns. Cave entrances were built slanted as a defence against grenade and flamethrower attacks. The caves and bunkers were connected to a vast system throughout the defences, which allowed the Japanese to evacuate or reoccupy positions as needed, and to take advantage of shrinking interior lines. This network of bunkers, tunnels, and pillboxes favoured the defence. For instance, the Japanese on Iwo Jima had several levels of honeycombed fortifications. The Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ), which was located east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water and ammo for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet deep and had tunnels running in various directions. Approximately 500 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were located inside the complex. Gasoline powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground. The Japanese caused the American advance to slow down and caused massive casualties with these underground fixed positions. The Americans eventually used flamethrowers and systematic hand-to-hand fighting to oust the defenders. The American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery, and had complete air supremacy provided by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps aviators throughout the entire battle.

=== Post-1945 to modern day ===

Trench warfare has been infrequent in recent wars. When two large armoured armies meet, the result has generally been mobile warfare of the type which developed in World War II. However, trench warfare re-emerged in the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War (Huaihai Campaign) and the Korean War (from July 1951 to its end).

During the Cold War, NATO forces routinely trained to fight through extensive works called &quot;Soviet-style trench systems&quot;, named after the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s complex systems of field fortifications, an extension of Soviet field entrenching practices for which they were famous in their Great Patriotic War (the Eastern Front of World War II).

In the Iran–Iraq War, both armies lacked training in combined arms operations. Both countries often prepared entrenched defensive positions and tunnels to protect and supply the cities and bases throughout the regions. Military mobility was drastically reduced; hidden anti-tank mines, and unstable footing made it easy to slide into or get buried in a camouflaged anti-tank trench. Tactics used included trench warfare, machine gun posts, bayonet charges, booby traps, use of barbed wire across trenches and on no-man&#x27;s land, Iranian human wave attacks, and Iraq&#x27;s extensive use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas against Iranian troops.

Iraq again attempted to use trenches during the 1991 Gulf War. After the Invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein with the objective of forcing the coalition to engage in costly World War I-era trench warfare, ordered the construction of a massive fortification line in the Saudi-Kuwait border, consisting of regular trench lines, &quot;flame trenches&quot; (ditches filled with oil to be ignited in case of attack), sand berms, trench works, anti-tank ditches, barbed wire and minefields, which became known as the Saddam Line. However, at the start of the Liberation of Kuwait, the US forces charged the Iraqi lines with M1 Abrams tanks modified with minesweeping ploughs and M728 Combat Engineer Vehicles which buried the trench lines, and in many cases, buried Iraqi troops alive. In less than three hours after the initial assault, US and coalition forces had already broken through and bypassed the Saddam line and the rest of war was composed by highly mobile manoeuvre warfare focusing on overwhelming power against the Iraqis.
There was an extensive trench system inside and outside the city during the 1992–1996 Siege of Sarajevo. It was used mainly for transportation to the front-line or to avoid snipers inside the city. Any pre-existing structures were used as trenches; the best known example is the bobsleigh course at Trebević, which was used by both Serb and Bosniaks forces during the siege.

In the Eritrean-Ethiopian War of 1998–2000, the widespread use of trenches raised comparisons to the trench warfare of World War I. According to some reports, trench warfare led to the loss of &quot;thousands of young lives in human-wave assaults on Eritrea&#x27;s positions&quot;. The Eritrean defences were eventually overtaken by a surprise Ethiopian pincer movement on the Western front, attacking a mined, but lightly defended mountain (without trenches), resulting in the capture of Barentu and an Eritrean retreat. The element of surprise in the attack involved the use of donkeys as pack animals as well as being a solely infantry affair, with tanks coming in afterwards only to secure the area.

The front line in Korea and the Line of Control in Kashmir between Pakistan and India are two examples of demarcation lines which could become hot at any time. They consist of kilometres of trenches linking fortified strongpoints and in Korea surrounded by millions of land mines. The Indian Army has fortified the LOC with 900 fixed tank turrets. The borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan amid the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict are also heavily fortified with trenches and barbed wire, with the two sides regularly trading fire.

==== Russo-Ukrainian War ====

In the Russo-Ukrainian War, to safeguard and assert their territories, both Ukrainian and Russian proxy forces have resorted to digging small trench networks and engaging in warfare akin to the trench fights of World War I in some aspects. This involves soldiers spending extended periods within trenches, employing cement mixers and excavators to construct tunnel networks and deep bunkers for added protection. After the Minsk peace agreements the front lines did not move significantly until the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, as both sides dug elaborate networks of trenches and deep bunkers for protection and the two sides mostly fired mortars and sniper shots at each other.

The 2022 invasion also saw the construction of trench lines and similar defensive structures by both sides, especially after the end of the initial Russian offensive, resulting in a static war of attrition with slow advances and artillery duels, especially in Donetsk Oblast. Pictures of muddy trenches, stumps of charred trees in a shell-pocked landscape made the Battle of Bakhmut emblematic for its trench warfare conditions, with neither side making any significant breakthroughs amid hundreds of casualties reported daily. Modern technology has adapted to the trench warfare, and use of drones and mobile networks is common. The battlefield has been described as &quot;World War I with 21st-century Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance&quot;.

== Cultural impact ==

Trench warfare has become a powerful symbol of the futility of war. Its image is of young men going &quot;over the top&quot; (over the parapet of the trench, to attack the enemy trench line) into a maelstrom of fire leading to near-certain death, typified by the first day of the Battle of the Somme (on which the British Army suffered nearly 60,000 casualties) or the grinding slaughter in the mud of Passchendaele. To the French, the equivalent is the attrition of the Battle of Verdun in which the French Army suffered over 380,000 documented combat deaths.

Trench warfare is associated with mass slaughter in appalling conditions. Many critics have argued that brave men went to their deaths because of incompetent and narrow-minded commanders who failed to adapt to the new conditions of trench warfare: class-ridden and backward-looking generals put their faith in the attack, believing superior morale and dash would overcome the weapons and moral inferiority of the defender. British public opinion often repeated the theme that their soldiers were &quot;lions led by donkeys&quot;.

World War I generals are often portrayed as callously persisting in repeated hopeless attacks against trenches. There were failures such as Passchendaele, and Sir Douglas Haig has often been criticised for allowing his battles to continue long after they had lost any purpose other than attrition. Haig&#x27;s defenders counter that the attrition was necessary in order to cause attrition in the German army.

The problems of trench warfare were recognised, and attempts were made to address them. These included improvements in artillery, infantry tactics, and the development of tanks. By 1918, taking advantage of failing German morale, Allied attacks were generally more successful and suffered fewer casualties; in the Hundred Days Offensive, there was a return to mobile warfare. However, if both sides have comparable equipment, capability, and conditions, the trench is still seen in modern wars.

<text>Sunnmørsposten () is a newspaper published by Polaris Media in Ålesund, Norway.

==History and profile==
In its early days, &quot;Sunnmørsposten&quot; competed with several other local newspapers, including &quot;Aalesunds Avis&quot; (1917–1957), &quot;Aalesunds blad&quot; (1871–1895), &quot;Aalesunds Handels- og Sjøfartstidende&quot; (1857–1904), &quot;Aalesunds Socialdemokrat&quot; (1908–1910), and &quot;Arbeidernes blad&quot; (1898).

Until May 2006 &quot;Sunnmørsposten&quot; was published in broadsheet format. At the time of its transition to compact format, it was one of the last newspapers in Norway to be published in broadsheet. Published in compact format (tabloid) six days a week, the paper consists of two sections; one for local news, sports and classified ads, and one for culture, weather, opinions and editorials and obituaries. On Saturdays they print a third weekend-section.

Mecom owned &quot;Sunnmorsposten&quot; until February 2009 when it was sold to the Polaris Media.

In 2012 &quot;Sunnmorsposten&quot; launched a project in datajournalism.

<text>The Boston Marathon is an annual marathon race hosted by several cities and towns in greater Boston in eastern Massachusetts, United States. It is traditionally held on Patriots&#x27; Day, the third Monday of April. Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics. The Boston Marathon is the world&#x27;s oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world&#x27;s best-known road racing events. It is one of seven World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.

The Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897, including a &quot;virtual alternative&quot; after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.

The event attracts 500,000 spectators along the route, making it New England&#x27;s most viewed sporting event. Starting with just 15 participants in 1897, the event has grown to an average of about 30,000 registered participants each year, with 30,251 people entering in 2015. The Centennial Boston Marathon in 1996 established a record as the world&#x27;s largest marathon with 38,708 entrants, 36,748 starters, and 35,868 finishers.

The Boston Marathon was first run in April 1897, having been inspired by the revival of the marathon for the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Until 2020 it was the oldest continuously running marathon, and the second longest continuously running footrace in North America, having debuted five months after the Buffalo Turkey Trot.

On April 19, 1897, ten years after the establishment of the B.A.A., the association held the marathon to conclude its athletic competition, the B.A.A. Games. The winner of the inaugural edition was John J. &quot;JJ&quot; McDermott, who ran the 24.5 mile course in 2:55:10, leading a field of 15. The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots&#x27; Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty. The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world&#x27;s oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf&#x27;s Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921. The first are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.

The Boston Marathon was originally a local event, but its fame and status have attracted runners from all over the world. For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches. However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.

Walter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964. During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: &quot;While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.&quot;

===Bobbi Gibb, Kathrine Switzer, and Nina Kuscik===

The Boston Marathon rule book made no mention of gender until after the 1967 race. Nor did the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) exclude women from races that included men until after the 1967 Boston Marathon. Roberta &quot;Bobbi&quot; Gibb&#x27;s attempt to register for the 1966 race was refused by race director Will Cloney in a letter in which he claimed women were physiologically incapable of running 26 miles.
Gibb nevertheless ran unregistered and finished the 1966 race in three hours, twenty-one minutes and forty seconds, ahead of two-thirds of the runners. Much later, she would be recognized by the race organizers as the first woman to run the entire Boston Marathon.

In 1967, Kathrine Switzer, who registered for the race using her official AAU registration number, paying the entry fee, providing a properly acquired fitness certificate, and signing her entry form with her usual signature &#x27;K. V. Switzer&#x27;, was the first woman to run and finish with a valid official race registration. As a result of Switzer&#x27;s completion of the race as the first officially registered woman runner, the AAU changed its rules to ban women from competing in races against men. Switzer finished the race despite race official Jock Semple repeatedly assaulting her in an attempt to rip off her race numbers and eject her from the race.

Nina Kuscsik was instrumental in influencing the Amateur Athletic Union, in late 1971, to increase its maximum distance for sanctioned women&#x27;s races, leading to official participation by women in marathons, beginning at Boston in 1972. Kuscsik was the first woman to officially win the Boston Marathon, which occurred in 1972.

In 1996, the B.A.A. retroactively recognized as champions the unofficial women&#x27;s leaders of 1966 through 1971. In 2022, about 43 percent of the entrants were women.

===Rosie Ruiz, the impostor===
In 1980, Rosie Ruiz crossed the finish line first in the women&#x27;s race. However, marathon officials became suspicious, and it was discovered that she did not appear in race videotapes until near the end of the race, with a subsequent investigation concluding that she had skipped most of the race and blended into the crowd about a half-mile (800m) from the finish line, where she then ran to her false victory. She was disqualified eight days later, and Canadian Jacqueline Gareau was proclaimed the winner.

===Participant deaths===
In 1905, James Edward Brooks of North Adams, Massachusetts, died of pneumonia shortly after running the marathon. In 1996, a 61-year-old Swedish man, Humphrey Siesage, died of a heart attack during the 100th running. In 2002, Cynthia Lucero, 28, died of hyponatremia.

===2011: Geoffrey Mutai and the IAAF===

On April 18, 2011, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya won the 2011 Boston Marathon in a time of 2:03:02:00. Although this was the fastest marathon ever run at the time, the International Association of Athletics Federations noted that the performance was not eligible for world record status given that the course did not satisfy rules that regarded elevation drop and start/finish separation (the latter requirement being intended to prevent advantages gained from a strong tailwind, as was the case in 2011). The Associated Press (AP) reported that Mutai had the support of other runners who describe the IAAF&#x27;s rules as &quot;flawed&quot;. According to the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, race director Dave McGillivray said he was sending paperwork to the IAAF in an attempt to have Mutai&#x27;s mark ratified as a world record. Although this was not successful, the AP indicated that the attempt to have the mark certified as a world record &quot;would force the governing bodies to reject an unprecedented performance on the world&#x27;s most prestigious marathon course&quot;.

===2013: Bombing===

On April 15, 2013, the Boston Marathon was still in progress at 2:49p.m. EDT (nearly three hours after the winner crossed the finish line), when two homemade bombs were set off about apart on Boylston Street, in approximately the last of the course. The race was halted, preventing many from finishing. Three spectators were killed and an estimated 264 were injured. Entrants who completed at least half the course and did not finish due to the bombing were given automatic entry in 2014. In 2015, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the perpetrators of the bombing, was found guilty of 30 federal offenses in connection with the attack and was sentenced to death. His older brother Tamerlan died after a gunfight with police and after Dzhokhar ran him over with a stolen vehicle.

===2014: Women&#x27;s race disqualification===
Bizunesh Deba of Ethiopia was eventually named women&#x27;s winner of the 2014 Boston Marathon, following the disqualification of Kenyan Rita Jeptoo from the event due to confirmed doping. Deba finished in a time of 2:19:59, and became the course record holder. Her performance bested that of Margaret Okayo, who ran a time of 2:20:43 in 2002.

===2016: Bobbi Gibb as grand marshal===
In the 2016 Boston Marathon, Jami Marseilles, an American, became the first female double amputee to finish the Boston Marathon. Bobbi Gibb, the first woman to have run the entire Boston Marathon (1966), was the grand marshal of the race. The Women&#x27;s Open division winner, Atsede Baysa, gave Gibb her trophy; Gibb said that she would go to Baysa&#x27;s native Ethiopia in 2017 and return it to her.

===2020: Cancellation===

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Boston Marathon was initially rescheduled from April 20 to September 14. It was the first postponement in the more than 100 year uninterrupted history of the event.

On May 28, 2020, it was announced that the rescheduled marathon set for September 14 was canceled. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said of the decision to cancel the race, &quot;There&#x27;s no way to hold this usual race format without bringing large numbers of people into close proximity. While our goal and our hope was to make progress in containing the virus and recovering our economy, this kind of event would not be responsible or realistic on September 14 or any time this year.&quot;

Runners were issued full refunds of entry fees. Organizers later staged a &quot;virtual alternative&quot; in September 2020 as the 124th running of the marathon. This was the second time that the format of the marathon was modified, the first having been in 1918, when the race was changed from a marathon to a military relay race (ekiden) because of .

===2021: Rescheduled to October===

On October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn. In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time. In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners. The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November. In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8–10 October.

===Qualifying===
The Boston Marathon is open to runners 18 or older from any nation, but they must meet certain qualifying standards. To qualify, a runner must first complete a standard marathon course certified by a national governing body affiliated with the World Athletics within a certain period of time before the date of the desired Boston Marathon (usually within approximately 18 months prior).

In the 1980s and 1990s, membership in USA Track &amp; Field was required of all runners, but this requirement has been eliminated.

Qualifying standards for the 2013 race were tightened on February 15, 2011, by five minutes in each age-gender group for marathons run after September 23, 2011. Prospective runners in the age range of 18–34 must run a time of no more than 3:00:00 (3 hours) if male, or 3:30:00 (3 hours 30 minutes) if female; the qualifying time is adjusted upward as age increases. In addition, the 59-second grace period on qualifying times has been eliminated; for example, a 40- to 44-year-old male will no longer qualify with a time of 3:10:01. For many marathoners, to qualify for Boston (to &quot;BQ&quot;) is a goal and achievement in itself. This leads many runners to find intrinsic motivation in qualifying for the elusive marathon by setting the specific, time-based, and difficult goals associated with the age-based time standard. 

An exception to the qualification times is for runners who receive entries from partners. About one-fifth of the marathon&#x27;s spots are reserved each year for charities, sponsors, vendors, licensees, consultants, municipal officials, local running clubs, and marketers. In 2010, about 5,470 additional runners received entries through partners, including 2,515 charity runners. The marathon currently allocates spots to two dozen charities who in turn are expected to raise more than $10 million a year. In 2017, charity runners raised $34.2 million for more than 200 non-profit organizations. The Boston Athletic Association&#x27;s Official Charity Program raised $17.96 million, John Hancock&#x27;s Non-Profit Program raised $12.3 million, and the last $3.97 million was raised by other qualified and invitational runners.

On October 18, 2010, the 20,000 spots reserved for qualifiers were filled in a record-setting eight hours and three minutes. The speed of registration prompted the B.A.A. to change its qualifying standards for the 2013 marathon onward. In addition to lowering qualifying times, the change includes a rolling application process, which gives faster runners priority. Organizers decided not to significantly adjust the number of non-qualifiers.

On September 27, 2018, the B.A.A. announced that they were lowering the qualifying times for the 2020 marathon by another five minutes, with male runners in the 18-34 age group required to run a time of 3:00:00 (3 hours) or less and female runners in the 18-34 age group required to run a time of 3:30:00 (3 hours, 30 minutes) or less in order to qualify.

In September 2024, the B.A.A. announced new qualifying times for the 2026 race, lowering the former qualifying times by five minutes for most age groups. The 18-34 age group needs to run a time of 2:55 (two hours, 55 minutes) for males, and 3:25 (3 hours, 25 minutes) for female and non-binary runners to qualify for the 2026 race.

===Race day===
The race has traditionally been held on Patriots&#x27; Day, a state holiday in Massachusetts, and until 1969 that was every April 19, whichever day of the week that fell on. From 1969 to 2019, the holiday was observed on the third Monday in April and so the marathon date was correspondingly fixed to that Monday, often referred to by local residents as &quot;Marathon Monday&quot;.

===Starting times===
Through 2005, the race began at noon (wheelchair race at 11:25a.m., and elite women at 11:31a.m.), at the official starting point in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. In 2006, the race used a staggered &quot;wave start&quot;, where top-seeded runners (the elite men&#x27;s group) and a first batch of up to 10,000 runners started at noon, with a second group starting at 12:30. The next year the starting times for the race were moved up, allowing runners to take advantage of cooler temperatures and enabling the roads to be reopened earlier. The marathon later added third and fourth waves to help further stagger the runners and reduce congestion.

The starting times for 2019 were:

* Men&#x27;s Push Rim Wheelchair: 9:02 a.m.
* Women&#x27;s Push Rim Wheelchair: 9:04 a.m.
* Handcycles and Duos: 9:25 a.m.
* Elite Women: 9:32 a.m.
* Elite Men: 10 a.m.

=== Course ===

The course runs through of winding roads, following Route 135, Route 16, Route 30 and city streets into the center of Boston, where the official finish line is located at Copley Square, alongside the Boston Public Library. The race runs through eight Massachusetts cities and towns: Hopkinton, Ashland, Framingham, Natick, Wellesley, Newton, Brookline, and Boston.

The Boston Marathon is considered to be one of the more difficult marathon courses because of the Newton hills, which culminate in &quot;Heartbreak Hill&quot; near Boston College. While the three hills on Commonwealth Avenue (Route 30) are better known, a preceding hill on Washington Street (Route 16), climbing from the Charles River crossing at , is regarded by Dave McGillivray, the long-term race director, as the course&#x27;s most difficult challenge. This hill, which follows a rise over a stretch, forces many lesser-trained runners to a walking pace.

====Heartbreak Hill====
Heartbreak Hill is an ascent over between the 20- and 21-mile (32- and 34-km) marks, near Boston College. It is the last of four &quot;Newton hills&quot;, which begin at the mark and challenge contestants with late (if modest) climbs after the course&#x27;s general downhill trend to that point. Though Heartbreak Hill itself rises only vertically (from an elevation of ), it comes in the portion of a marathon distance where muscle glycogen stores are most likely to be depleted—a phenomenon referred to by marathoners as &quot;hitting the wall&quot;.

It was on this hill that, in 1936, defending champion John A. &quot;Johnny&quot; Kelley overtook Ellison &quot;Tarzan&quot; Brown, giving him a consolatory pat on the shoulder as he passed. This gesture renewed the competitive drive in Brown, who rallied, pulled ahead of Kelley, and went on to win—thereby, it was said, breaking Kelley&#x27;s heart.

===Records===

Because the course drops from start to finish and the start is quite far west of the finish, allowing a helpful tailwind, the Boston Marathon does not satisfy two of the criteria necessary for the ratification of world or American records.

At the 2011 Boston Marathon on April 18, 2011, Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya ran a time of 2:03:02, which was the fastest ever marathon at the time (since surpassed by Eliud Kipchoge&#x27;s 2:01:39 in Berlin 2018). However, due to the reasons listed above, Mutai&#x27;s performance was not ratified as an official world record. Bezunesh Deba from Ethiopia set the women&#x27;s course record with a 2:19:59 performance on April 21, 2014. This was declared after Rita Jeptoo from Kenya was disqualified following a confirmed doping violation.

Other course records include:
*Men&#x27;s Masters: John Campbell (New Zealand), 2:11:04 (set in 1990)
*Women&#x27;s Masters: Firiya Sultanova-Zhdanova (Russia), 2:27:58 (set in 2002)
*Men&#x27;s Push Rim Wheelchair: Marcel Hug (Switzerland), 1:17:06 (set in 2023)
*Women&#x27;s Push Rim Wheelchair: Manuela Schär (Switzerland), 1:28:17 (set in 2017)
*Men&#x27;s Handcycle: Tom Davis (United States), 0:58:36 (set in 2017)
*Women&#x27;s Handcycle: Alicia Dana (United States), 1:18:15 (set in 2023)

On only four occasions have world record times for marathon running been set in Boston. In 1947, the men&#x27;s record time set was 2:25:39, by Suh Yun-Bok of South Korea. In 1975, a women&#x27;s world record of 2:42:24 was set by Liane Winter of West Germany, and in 1983, Joan Benoit Samuelson of the United States ran a women&#x27;s world record time of 2:22:43. In 2012 Joshua Cassidy of Canada set a men&#x27;s wheelchair marathon world-record time of 1:18:25.

In 2007, astronaut Sunita Williams was an official entrant of the race, running a marathon distance while on the International Space Station, becoming the first person to run a marathon in space. She was sent a specialty bib and medal by the B.A.A. on the STS-117 flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

The race&#x27;s organizers keep a standard time clock for all entries, though official timekeeping ceases after the six-hour mark.

==The B.A.A.==
The &quot;Boston Athletic Association&quot; is a non-profit, organized sports association that organizes the Boston Marathon and other events.

==Divisions==
In 1975, the Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division competition. Bob Hall wrote race director Will Cloney to ask if he could compete in the race in his wheelchair. Cloney wrote back that he could not give Hall a race number, but would recognize Hall as an official finisher if he completed the race in under 3 hours and 30 minutes. Hall finished in 2 hours and 58 minutes, paving the way for the wheelchair division. Ernst Van Dyk, in 2004, set a course record at 1:18.29, almost 50 minutes faster than the fastest runner.

Also in 1975, the Boston Marathon first included a women&#x27;s masters division, which Sylvia Weiner won, at age 44 with a time of 3:21:38.

Handcyclists have competed in the race since at least 2014. Starting in 2017, handcyclists are honored the same way runners and wheelchair racers are: with wreaths, prize money, and the playing of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s winners&#x27; national anthems.

In addition to the push rim wheelchair division, the Boston Marathon also hosts a blind/visually impaired division, and a mobility impaired program. Similar to the running divisions, a set of qualifying times has been developed for these divisions to motivate aspiring athletes and ensure competitive excellence. In 1986, the introduction of prize money at the Boston Marathon gave the push rim wheelchair division the richest prize purse in the sport. More than 1,000 people with disabilities and impairments have participated in the wheelchair division, while the other divisions have gained popularity each year. In 2013, 40 blind runners participated.

The nonbinary division of the Boston Marathon was first included in 2023; it was won by Kae Ravichandran with a time of 2:38:57.

==Memorial==
The Boston Marathon Memorial in Copley Square, which is near the finish line, was installed to mark the one-hundredth running of the race. A circle of granite blocks set in the ground surrounds a central medallion that traces the race course and other segments that show an elevation map of the course and the names of the winners.

==Notable features==

===Spectators===
With approximately 500,000 spectators, the Boston Marathon is New England&#x27;s most widely viewed sporting event. About 1,000 media members from more than 100 outlets received media credentials in 2011.

For the entire distance of the race, thousands line the sides of the course to cheer the runners on, encourage them, and provide free water and snacks to the runners.

=== Scream Tunnel ===

At Wellesley College, a women&#x27;s college, it is traditional for the students to cheer on the runners in what is referred to as the Scream Tunnel. For about a quarter of a mile (400m), the students line the course, scream, and offer kisses. 
The Scream Tunnel is so loud runners claim it can be heard from a mile away. The tunnel is roughly half a mile (0.8km) prior to the halfway mark of the course.

===Boston Red Sox===
Every year, the Boston Red Sox play a home game at Fenway Park, starting at 11:05a.m. When the game ends, the crowd empties into Kenmore Square to cheer as the runners enter the final mile. This tradition started in 1903. In the 1940s, the Red Sox from the American League and the Boston Braves from the National League (who moved to Milwaukee after the 1953 season) alternated yearly as to which would play the morning game. In 2007, the game between the Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was delayed until 12:18p.m. due to heavy rain. The marathon, which had previously been run in a wide variety of weather conditions, was not delayed. The 2018 game hosting the Baltimore Orioles was postponed into May due to rain, while 2020 saw the game not played resulting from the pandemic.

===Dick and Rick Hoyt===
Dick and Rick Hoyt entered the Boston Marathon 32 times. Dick was the father of Rick, who had cerebral palsy. While doctors said that Rick would never have a normal life and thought that institutionalizing him was the best option, Dick and his wife disagreed and raised him at home. Eventually, a computer device was developed that helped Rick communicate with his family, and they learned that one of his biggest passions was sports. &quot;Team Hoyt&quot; (Dick and Rick) started competing in charity runs, with Dick pushing Rick in a wheelchair. Through August 2008, Dick and Rick had competed in 66 marathons and 229 triathlons. Their fastest marathon finish was 2:40:47. The team completed their 30th Boston Marathon in 2012, when Dick was 72 and Rick was 50. They had intended the 2013 marathon to be their final one, but due to the Boston Marathon bombing, they were stopped a mile short of completing their run, and decided to run one more marathon the following year. They completed the 2014 marathon on April 21, 2014, having previously announced that it would be their last. In tribute to his connection with the race, Dick was named the Grand Marshal of the 2015 marathon. He died in 2021, aged 80. Rick died in May 2023.

===Bandits===
Unlike many other races, the Boston Marathon tolerated &quot;bandits&quot; (runners who do not register and obtain a bib number). They used to be held back until after all the registered runners had left the starting line, and then were released in an unofficial fourth wave. They were generally not pulled off the course and mostly allowed to cross the finish line. For decades, these unofficial runners were treated like local folk heroes, celebrated for their endurance and spunk for entering a contest with the world&#x27;s most accomplished athletes. Boston Marathon race director Dave McGillivray was once a teenage bandit.

Given the increased field that was expected for the 2014 Marathon, however, organizers planned &quot;more than ever&quot; to discourage bandits from running. As of September 2015 the B.A.A. website states:
Q: Can I run in the Boston Marathon as an unofficial or &quot;bandit&quot; runner?
A: No, please do NOT run if you have not been officially entered in the race. Race amenities along the course and at the finish, such as fluids, medical care, and traffic safety, are provided based on the number of expected official entrants. Any addition to this by way of unofficial participants, adversely affects our ability to ensure a safe race for everyone.

===Costumes===
A number of people choose to run the course in a variety of costumes each year. During the 100th running in 1996, one runner wore a scale model of the Old North Church steeple on his back. Old North Church is where the signal was lit that set Paul Revere off on his midnight ride, which is commemorated each year on the same day as the Marathon. During the 2014 marathon, runners and spectators were discouraged from wearing &quot;costumes covering the face or any non-form fitting, bulky outfits extending beyond the perimeter of the body,&quot; for security reasons following the 2013 bombing. However, state authorities and the Boston Athletic Association did not outright ban such costumes.

=== Ondekoza &quot;taiko&quot; drummers ===

Starting in 1975, members of Ondekoza, a group from Japan, would run the marathon and right after finishing the race would start playing their &quot;taiko&quot; drums at the finish line. They repeated the tradition several times in the 1970s and 1990s. The drum would be set up at the finish line to encourage runners finishing the marathon. Bill Rodgers, who inspired member&#x27;s running, was a guest on Sado Island and ran marathons in Japan with Ondekoza members. The group also ran the New York City Marathon and Los Angeles Marathon, and ran of the perimeter of the United States from 1990 to 1993.

<text>The Battle of Roundway Down was fought on 13 July 1643 at Roundway Down near Devizes, in Wiltshire during the First English Civil War. Despite being outnumbered and exhausted after riding overnight from Oxford, a Royalist cavalry force under Lord Wilmot won a crushing victory over the Parliamentarian Army of the West under Sir William Waller.

Viewed as their most decisive victory of the war, the Royalists secured control of South West England which they held until late 1645. Two weeks later they captured the port of Bristol, allowing them to establish links with supporters in Ireland.

==Prelude==
After the hard fought Battle of Lansdown, the Royalists withdrew from Lansdown to Marshfield, hoping to obtain reinforcements and supplies from their wartime capital of Oxford. They arrived in Chippenham on 7 July. Meanwhile, despite his retreat, Waller&#x27;s army was largely intact after the battle and losses were quickly replaced by the Parliamentarian garrison in Bristol. Hopton&#x27;s precarious position provided Waller an opportunity to crush him if he moved fast enough and Waller set out from Bath with 5,000 troops, reaching Chippenham on 9 July.

As the Parliamentarians approached, Hopton marched south to Devizes, followed by Waller who occupied Roundway Down, high ground approximately 2 kilometres north of the town. Short of materials and outnumbered, the Royalists agreed that Prince Maurice and 300 cavalry would break out and race to Oxford for reinforcements, leaving Hopton and the 3,000 Cornish foot to hold Devizes. Departing at midnight on 10 July, Maurice reached Oxford next morning; most of the Royalist field army was absent but Lord Wilmot assembled 1,500 cavalry, then set out for Devizes with Maurice and his men.
==Siege of Devizes==
On 11 July, Waller brought his army down from Roundway Down and deployed them on the east side of Devizes. To support an attack, he set up an artillery battery within range of the town on Coatefield Hill. Stalling for time, Hopton asked for and received a truce to allow time for negotiations. Overnight as the Parliamentarians waited for Hopton’s response, their cavalry intercepted and captured a Royalist convoy of gunpowder and ammunition that had previously been dispatched to resupply Hopton after the Battle at Lansdowne. Many of their escort escaped but 200 were captured along with the wagons.

On the morning of 12 July, Waller ended talks and began an assault, first bombarding the town with artillery before his infantry attacked the outworks and fortifications. Despite hours of fierce hand-to-hand combat, at the end of the day the Royalists remained in control of Devizes. Early next morning, Wilmot&#x27;s relief force neared Roundway Down, and as they did so fired several cannon to warn Hopton of their approach. Waller now abandoned the siege and marched his force north to intercept them; reaching the high ground, the infantry and artillery were placed in the centre, with Waller commanding the cavalry on the left and Sir Arthur Haselrig the right.

==Battle==
The Royalist cavalry was divided into three brigades; as well as being in overall command, Wilmot led the brigade on the left, with Sir John Byron on the right, and the Earl of Crawford in reserve. Despite having ridden all night, Wilmot attacked immediately and caught Waller out of position, with Haselrig and his regiment of &quot;London lobsters&quot; in an exposed forward position. Haselrig tried to rally his men but withdrew when he saw Byron preparing to attack, and rejoined the rest of Waller&#x27;s cavalry.

As Waller advanced down the hill, Byron continued his attack supported by Wilmot and the Royalist reserve under Crawford; with their infantry unable to fire for fear of hitting their own men, the Parliamentarian cavalry were swept from the field. Pursued by the Royalists, some of them rode over the edge of a steep precipice and into an area that became known as &quot;the Bloody Ditch&quot;.

Now isolated and with 3,000 Royalists from Devizes advancing against their rear, Waller ordered his infantry into defensive squares and began withdrawing towards the northwest. After approximately an hour, Byron’s cavalry returned from their pursuit and captured the Parliamentarian artillery which they turned on the retreating enemy, quickly causing them to break apart. Fleeing in all directions, many were cut down by Wilmot&#x27;s men; Waller and the remnants of his cavalry escaped toward Bristol, leaving the remainder to surrender.

==Aftermath==
The Parliamentarian army in the west was virtually wiped out, with losses estimated to be as many as 600 killed and 1,200 captured, along with their artillery, wagons, gunpowder, ammunition, and supplies. In his letter reporting the victory, Byron lists Royalist losses as &quot;very few killed, but many hurt&quot;, although this applies only to officers and other &quot;gentlemen&quot;. Arguably the most comprehensive Royalist victory of the war, it secured the south-west and less than two weeks later they captured the vital port of Bristol, allowing them to establish links with their supporters in Ireland.

The battle was an outstanding victory for the Royalists; despite travelling over 60 kilometres directly onto the battlefield, 1,800 cavalry defeated a superior force of 5,000 including cavalry, infantry, and artillery. They were helped by the high quality of Wilmot&#x27;s force, which contained some of the most experienced units in the Royalist army, and the &quot;deplorable tactics&quot; employed by Haselrig, who awaited Wilmot&#x27;s charge at the halt, hoping their carbine fire would drive them off. This was a mistake commonly made by Parliamentarian cavalry leaders in the early stages of the war. Conversely, Waller’s reputation as a military leader suffered because of the loss, even though historians claim that his leadership at both Lansdowne and Roundway Down was without fault.

The village of Roundway is today a small hamlet 2 kilometres north of Devizes with a population of approximately 25 residents. Discussions regarding permanent burial sites for those who lost their lives in the battle are under consideration today.

<text>Lüdenscheid () is a city in the Märkischer Kreis district, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located in the Sauerland region.

==Geography==
Lüdenscheid is located on the saddle of the watershed between the Lenne and Volme rivers which both empty into the Ruhr river (which subsequently flows into the Rhine), with three smaller valleys leading to them. The saddle has a height of 420 meters, higher elevations on the watershed are an unnamed hilltop of 505 meters in the north, and the 663 meters high &quot;Nordhelle&quot; in the Ebbe Mountains range. In the surrounding mountainous area, six dams created reservoirs to regulate the water flow in the Ruhr river and supply drinking water. The mountainous nature of the city&#x27;s territory gave rise to the nickname &quot;Bergstadt&quot; (mountain town). The original settlement circles around the church built on a ledge of the slope above the saddle.

==Climate==

==History==
While first settlement in the Lüdenscheid area is confirmed for the 9th century, the first mention of the place as a village was made in 1067 and as a city in 1268. In the 15th and 16th century Lüdenscheid was a member of the Hanseatic League. Since 1609 the town belonged to the Electorate of Brandenburg, the later Prussia. In 1815 it became part of the new Prussian Province of Westphalia, and 1975, with the creation of the Märkischer Kreis, became seat of its administration. In 1898 the aluminium framework of the first Zeppelin airship was built in the factory of Carl Berg in Lüdenscheid.

==Economy==
Lüdenscheid is a predominantly industrial city with small and medium-sized firms in the metal and plastics industry. The largest company employs 2,000 people in Lüdenscheid, with other firms employing 800 people or less.

The economic importance came to the fore in the Middle Ages, when the city became a centre for metal ore mining in the surrounding area, through the (&quot;osemund&quot;/osmond iron). The ore was processed by the hammers and wire drawers of Lüdenscheid, serviced by water power in the surrounding valleys. A number of artisanal smitheries in Lüdenscheid made finished products out of those materials. In order to market these products to a wider area, Lüdenscheid joined the Hanseatic League.

With the emergence of the industrial age, the production of buttons and buckles played a large role, reflected in the Button Museum. Later, new materials like aluminium, bakelite, and plastics were adopted. A supporting industry producing the forms for the stamping, blanking, pressing and casting emerged and still plays an important part in Lüdenscheid&#x27;s industry.

Production of parts of the auto industry and of fittings for electrical installations play an important role as well as continuous casting of aluminium profiles. Products notable to end consumers are lamps and lighting systems and toys.

==Education==
One of the five branches of South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences is in Lüdenscheid. See also the Fachhochschule Südwestfalen (FH SWF)), which offers various engineering programmes and is located in the city.

==Places of interest==
* &quot;Church of the Redeemer&quot;
:in the center of the circular layout of the old city. The protestant church is the oldest in the city. Its tower dates from the 11th century, while the parish nave was rebuilt during the classicistic period in the early 19th century.
* &quot;Water castle Neuenhof&quot;
:in the Elspe valley behind the &quot;Nurre&quot; mountain. The present building with an early baroque style was erected in the end of the 17th century.
* &quot;Homert tower&quot;
:Observation tower on top of the Homert mountain (539 m above sea level), the highest location in Lüdenscheid
* &quot;Verse River reservoir&quot;
* &quot;City Museum&quot;
:including among others the &quot;Button Museum&quot; and other exhibits showing the evolution of Lüdenscheid&#x27;s industry

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows Saint Medardus as the patron of the city. Below it has the red-and-white checked fess from the arms of the Counts of the Mark. The city wall at the bottom denotes the city rights that Lüdenscheid received in 1287.

==Sports==
&quot;Lüdenscheid-Nord&quot; is a demeaning and satirical name, most commonly used by the fans of FC Schalke 04 to mock the football club Borussia Dortmund. The real football club Rot-Weiß Lüdenscheid is playing in the Bezirksliga, the eight level below the Bundesliga, but did play once in the second Bundesliga Nord (Northern section) for two seasons in 1977–78 and 1978–79.

The Highlander Lüdenscheid are a skaterhockey-team playing in the highest German league, the Bundesliga.

==Culture==
The Lüdenscheider Altstadtbühne ist a part of the culture in Lüdenscheid. It is based in the Luisenstraße.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Lüdenscheid is twinned with:

* Den Helder, Netherlands (1980)
* Brighouse, England (1983)
* Leuven, Belgium (1987)
* Myślenice, Poland (1989)
* Romilly-sur-Seine, France (1991)
* Taganrog, Russia (1991)

<text>Miles per hour (mph, m.p.h., MPH, or mi/h) is a British imperial and United States customary unit of speed expressing the number of miles travelled in one hour. It is used in the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of smaller countries, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US.

==Usage==


===Road traffic===
Speed limits and road traffic speeds are given in miles per hour in the following jurisdictions:
*Antigua and Barbuda

*Belize 
*Dominica 
*Grenada 
*Liberia (occasionally)
*Marshall Islands
*Micronesia
*Palau
*Saint Kitts and Nevis

=== Rail networks ===
Miles per hour is the unit used on the US, Canadian and Irish rail systems. Miles per hour is also used on British rail systems, excluding trams, some light metro systems, the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1.

===Nautical and aeronautical usage===
Nautical and aeronautical applications favour the knot as a common unit of speed. (One knot is one nautical mile per hour, with a nautical mile being exactly 1,852 metres or about 6,076 feet.)

=== Other usage ===
In some countries mph may be used to express the speed of delivery of a ball in sporting events such as cricket, tennis and baseball.

<doc id="182284" wikidata="Q831251" url="?curid=182284" title="Dewoitine D.520">
<text>The Dewoitine D.520 is a French fighter aircraft that entered service in early 1940, shortly after the beginning of the Second World War.

The D.520 was designed in response to a 1936 requirement from the French Air Force for a fast, modern fighter with a good climbing speed and an armament centred on a 20 mm cannon. At the time the most powerful V-12 liquid-cooled engine available in France was the Hispano-Suiza 12Y, which was less powerful, but lighter than contemporary engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Daimler-Benz DB 601. Other fighters were designed to meet the specifications but none of them entered service, or entered service in small numbers, too late to play a significant role during the Battle of France.

Unlike the Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, which was at that time the most numerous fighter in the French Air Force, the Dewoitine D.520 came close to being a match for the latest German types, such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109. It was slower than the Bf 109E but superior in manoeuvrability. Because of production delays, only a small number were available for combat against the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The D.520 proved to be relatively capable as a dogfighter against the Luftwaffe&#x27;s inventory, but lacked sufficient numbers to make a difference.

Following the armistice of 1940, the D.520 continued to be used, being operated by both the Free French Air Force and the Vichy French Air Force. The type was also returned to production during 1942, although it was manufactured at a lower rate than it had been during 1940. Additional examples were operated by the Luftwaffe, Regia Aeronautica Italiana, and the Bulgarian Air Force. The D.520 saw combat service in North Africa, Bulgaria, and the Eastern Front, as well as use in France and Germany for training and defence purposes. During the type&#x27;s later life, it was used as a trainer aircraft. On 3 September 1953, the last D.520s were finally withdrawn from service.

==Development==
===Background===
On 13 July 1934, the French Air Force launched a new technical programme, under which the development of improved fighter aircraft to improve upon the Dewoitine D.510, which was yet to enter service at that point but was already considered to be obsolete in the face of rapid advances being made in several European nations. While French aircraft company Dewoitine initially responded with an improved design based on the D.510, designated as the D.513, this quickly proved to be inferior to the in-development Morane-Saulnier M.S.405, a domestic competitor.

In response to a specification for a new fighter promulgated by the French Air Ministry on 15 June 1936, Émile Dewoitine, owner and founder of Dewoitine, formed a new private design office and ordered the firm&#x27;s chief engineer, Robert Castello, to immediately study the development of a new fighter. The envisioned aircraft would be as affordable as possible, be powered by the new Hispano-Suiza 12Y21 liquid-cooled engine, and be capable of attaining . However, the corresponding design was promptly rejected by the Air Ministry. The design had been rejected by the French Air Ministry, which, after being impressed by the British Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, had decided to respond by uprating the specifications to include a maximum speed requirement of .

Accordingly, work on what would become the D.520 commenced in September 1936; according to aviation author Raymond Danel, the D.520 designation was a deliberate reference to the required speed of the aircraft. During January 1937, this revised design proposal was submitted to the Service Technique Aeronautique (STA); while the STAe found the design to be likely to conform with the specified requirements, no order for prototypes to be built was immediately forthcoming. By this point, official attention was oriented towards the MS.405, which had already been selected for the re-equipment effort.

===Specification and rivals===
On 12 January 1937, the A.23 technical programme was launched by the Air Ministry. The specifications called for a maximum speed of at , the ability to climb to in less than fifteen minutes, with takeoff and landing runs not exceeding . The armament was to be two machine guns and one Hispano-Suiza HS.9 cannon, or two HS.9 cannons.

Other aircraft designed to the same specification included the Morane-Saulnier M.S.450, the Loire-Nieuport 60 (later C.A.O 200), and the Caudron-Renault C.770, none of which either left the drawing board or entered service. Two other concurrent French designs, the Bloch MB.152.01 and Bloch MB.155.C1 series and the Arsenal VG-33 entered service in small numbers with the French Air Force during the Battle of France, but too late to play a significant role.

In addition to the lack of a prototype order, Dewoitine was absorbed into the larger Société nationale des constructions aéronautiques du Midi (SNCAM) state-owned manufacturing consortium. As a result of this organisational restricting, along with continued alterations within the French Air Force&#x27;s established manufacturing programmes, work on the design of the D.520 was suspended throughout much of 1937, and it was not until January 1938 that a small number of draughtsmen started work on the first detailed drawings for the prototype.

However, Émile Dewoitine, now the deputy managing director of SNCAM, was keen to proceed with the project and decided to proceed to the detail design drawing phase with the aim of producing a pair of prototypes and a single structural test frame, confident that official interest would be found for the type. On 3 April 1938, this private initiative was rewarded with the issuing of Air Ministry contract No. 513/8, which regularised the programme; by this point, the first prototype had almost been completed.

===Modifications and first prototypes===
On 2 October 1938, the first prototype aircraft, D.520-01, powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Y-21 engine that temporarily drove a fixed-pitch, two-bladed wooden propeller, performed its maiden flight. Completion of the prototype had been delayed somewhat by the need to incorporate modifications requested by the STAe following their examination of a wooden mock-up of the type. During early flight tests, the first prototype managed to reach only , and suffered from dangerously high engine temperatures.

A large portion of responsibility for the encountered temperature issue was judged to have been a product of greater than expected drag resulting from the underwing radiators, which exhausted across the upper wing surface and were relatively inefficient; this arrangement was replaced with a single radiator unit housed under the fuselage in a streamlined fairing. Other aerodynamic improvements were made around this time, such as the minor enlargement of the fin and rudder, for greater lateral stability.

After sustaining minor damage in a landing accident on 27 November 1938, caused by the failure to deploy the undercarriage, further modifications were made to the prototype. These included changing the engine to a newer -29 model and incorporating exhaust ejectors which provided added thrust, along with a three-blade variable-pitch propeller. These changes were enough to allow the aircraft to reach its design speed, achieving . The maximum diving speed was , as reached on 6 February 1939.

===Additional prototypes===
During 1939, the first prototype was followed by two further examples: the D.520-02 and the 03, these were first flown on 9 January 1939 and 5 May 1939, respectively. The major differences between the first prototype and the second and third were the adoption of a new sliding canopy, the fitting of a re-designed and larger tail unit, and longer Oleo-manufactured undercarriage legs; they also omitted the Handley Page slats fitted to the outer wings on 01.

These prototypes were also armed with a single Hispano-Suiza HS.9 cannon with the barrel was in a sleeve between the cylinder banks and fired through the propeller spinner. and a pair of MAC 1934 machine guns, each initially with 300 rounds per gun, housed in small pods under the wing. The third prototype also introduced a small tailwheel instead of the original skid. The second prototype was later fitted with a Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 engine and achieved a maximum speed of and reached in 12 minutes 53 seconds.

In response to Belgian interest in the D.520, who were at one stage preparing to negotiate for a licence to produce the type, several evaluation flights of the third prototype were flown by Belgian test pilot Captain Arendt. During late September 1939, CEMA took charge of the third prototype to conduct armament trials. Overall, flight tests had proceeded successfully, and resulted in the issuing of a contract in March 1939 for 200 production machines to be powered by the newer -31 engine (later replaced by the -45). A contract for an additional 600 aircraft was issued in June, albeit reduced to 510 in July 1939.

===Production===
In April 1939, the rate of production of fighter aircraft throughout France was far beneath official expectations. With the outbreak of war, a new contract brought the total of D.520s on order to 1,280, with the production rate to be 200 aircraft per month from May 1940. During January 1940, the &quot;Aéronautique Navale&quot; placed its own order for 120 aircraft. Another French Air Force order in April 1940 brought the total to 2,250 and increased production quotas to 350 a month. In addition to domestic orders, Poland was interested in acquiring around 160 D.520s in order.

On 2 November 1939, the first-production D.520 conducted its first flight. On this and the other aircraft, the rear fuselage was extended by , the engine cowling panels were redesigned, the curved, one-piece windscreen was replaced by one containing an optically flat panel and armour plate was fitted behind the pilot&#x27;s seat. Most production examples were powered by the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 with the new Szydlowski-Planiol supercharger, although later production versions used the Hispano-Suiza 12Y-49. The production standard armament was a HS.404 cannon firing through the propeller hub and four belt-fed MAC 1934 M39 machine guns in the wings.
As the first batch of D.520s rolled off the production line, they failed acceptance tests due to insufficient top speed and troublesome cooling. Redesigned compressor intakes, a modified cooling circuit and propulsive exhaust pipes proved to be effective remedies of these shortcomings, but as early examples had to be retrofitted with these improvements, the type was not declared combat ready until April 1940, at which point the D.520&#x27;s operational standards had been defined. In order to speed up the redesign process, a total of four production aircraft were handed back to SNCAM to serve as special test machines.

The manufacturing process was deliberately optimized, each aircraft consumed a reduced 7,000 man-hours each to produce, roughly half the time compared to the previous D.510 and MS.406, and far less than many other fighters of the time, such as the MC.200/202 (21,000 hours), but around 50% greater than a Bf 109E (4,500 hours). The French Air Ministry planned for over 300 aircraft a month to be built and managed to reach this goal, especially in June 1940, but it was too late to affect the tide of battle. The armistice greatly curtailed production of D.520, which would have otherwise been a fighter aircraft produced in far greater numbers and with improved models.

Additional plans had included another manufacturing line at Asnières-sur-Seine, Paris, for a lightened version of the aircraft, known as the &quot;D.521&quot;. An initial batch of 18 pre-production D.521s had been produced at Bagnères-de-Bigorre, Occitanie and had been prepared for their maiden flight when the armistice came into effect. During 1940, negotiations with American manufacturer Ford had been underway with the aim of establishing the licensed production of an Americanised version of the type, designated as the &quot;D.522&quot;. This model was anticipated to have been powered by an Allison V-1710-C15 engine, capable of generating , instead.

In April 1941, during the aftermath of the armistice with Germany, a new programme was launched in which the production of 1,074 new aircraft were to be manufactured in the unoccupied zone of Vichy France. Of these, 550 were to be D.520s, which were confirmed as ordered under contract No. 157/41 on 8 August 1941. The intention was for the type to replace all other single-engine fighters that remained in service with the Vichy French Air Force and to eventually equip additional units that were to be reformed from September 1942 onwards. An initial batch of 22 D.520s were delivered during August 1941. In total, a further 180 machines were constructed, bringing the production total to 905.

==Design==
===Overview===

The Dewoitine D.520 was a French fighter aircraft, intended to be a capable contemporary of types such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Supermarine Spitfire. An all-metal structure was used, except for fabric-covered ailerons and tail surfaces. The wing, even if single-spar, was a solid and rigid unit with a secondary spar and many reinforced parts. The inwardly retracting undercarriage had a broad track, and was fitted with wide, low-pressure tyres.

The D.520 was designed to be maintained easily with many inspection panels, a rare feature for its time. Recharging the D.520 ammunition was swift and easy; the machine gun magazines required five minutes each and three minutes for the cannon. To fill the machine gun ammunition boxes took 15 minutes, while five minutes were needed to empty it as the cartridges were not expelled. The D.520&#x27;s cockpit was set well back in the fuselage, aft of the trailing edge of the wings. This gave the pilot good downward visibility, but the long nose in front of him was a drawback when taxiing on the ground.

A self-sealing fuel tank with a capacity of was mounted between the engine and cockpit, along with two wing tanks which, combined, carried another , for a total of ; this was considerably more than the contemporary Bf 109E, Spitfire I and early Italian fighters, each with about fuel capacity. The ferry range was from at which, from June 1940, allowed D.520s to escape to North Africa when France fell.

===Engine===
The Hispano-Suiza 12Y-45 engine was an underpowered, older design, with at takeoff at 2,400 rpm, or emergency power at 2,520 rpm and at a height of . The Hispano engine had some advantages over some later engines; for example, its weight was only , compared to the of the Rolls-Royce Merlin III. Development of the engine had not been straightforward, and had delayed production. According to an aviation author, it was alleged by American aviator Charles Lindbergh that secret negotiations were conducted between Dewoitine and Daimler-Benz during 1939 to obtain the DB.601 engine for the D.520, but that these did not come to fruition due to the war.

Fuel was fed via six Solex S.V. 56 carburettors mounted on an inlet manifold which directed compressed air from the supercharger to the engine cylinders; the 12Y-45 and -49s fitted to production D.520s used either 92 or 100 octane fuel. The -45 drove an electrically operated Ratier Type 1606M three-bladed, , variable-pitch propeller, while D.520s from No. 351 were fitted with the 12Y-49 engine driving a Chauvière type 3918 pneumatically operated propeller, in diameter.

By 1940 a version of the 520D was flying with a Rolls-Royce Merlin X engine. Ernest Hives stated that agreement had been reached with the French Government for the manufacture of the Merlin in France. (&quot;The Merlin in perspective&quot; - A Harvey-Bailey -Rolls-Royce Heritage Trust, p130)

===Fire suppression system===
The D.520 had a fire-suppression system with a fire extinguisher activated from the cockpit. The engine was started by a simple but effective system, operating with compressed air. A Viet 250 air compressor charged several air bottles (one with a 12-litre capacity, as well as another eight litre tank, three smaller one litre units were matched to the weapons). The 12-litre air bottle was used for the brakes and later, for the Chauvière propeller&#x27;s constant speed adjustment. The small air bottles provided up to 12 seconds at or 20 seconds at low level, before the Viet air compressor recharged them. The pilot had a complete set of cockpit instruments, and a ten-litre oxygen bottle located in the fuselage just behind his seat, with either a Munerelle or Gourdou oxygen regulator system mounted on the right instrument panel. Equipment included a &quot;Radio Industrie Type Rl 537&quot; radio-receiver set, an OPL RX 39 reflector sight (less effective than the Revi system), a height-adjustable seat, and a sliding canopy with large, clear panels. Except over the long nose, the pilot&#x27;s view was good, since he was seated quite high over the forward fuselage; however, no rear-facing mirrors were fitted.

===Armament===

Production-standard armament consisted of a HS.404, which had an ammunition capacity of 60 rounds, firing through the propeller hub, and four belt-fed MAC 1934 M39 machine guns in the wings, with 675 rounds per gun. The MAC 1934 machine guns had a high rate of fire of 1,200 rounds per minute (rpm), while the HS.404 had an effective rate of fire of 600 rpm and was accurate up to ; the ammunition capacity meant that the machine guns could be fired for a total of 30 seconds, while the cannon had ten seconds&#x27; worth of ammunition.

In combat, the MS.406 had only a pair of machine guns and was, therefore, at a disadvantage when the HS.404 had used up its ammunition, while a D.520 could continue to fight effectively because it had four fast-firing machine guns (over 80 rounds/sec), with 20-plus seconds of ammunition still available. The D.520 had provisions for two BE33 &quot;illuminating bombs&quot;, useful for nocturnal interception missions, but these were seldom used because French fighters rarely flew nighttime missions.

===Flight performance===
Although employing a modern design philosophy for its time, the D.520 was considered more difficult to fly than the older MS.406. Captain Eric Brown, commanding officer of the Royal Aircraft Establishment&#x27;s Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight, tested the D.520 at RAE Farnborough, saying that &quot;It was a nasty little brute. Looked beautiful but didn&#x27;t fly beautifully. Once you get it on the ground, I was told not to leave the controls until it was in the hangar and the engine stopped. You could be taxiing toward the hangar and sit back when suddenly it would go in a right angle.&quot;

The handling changed according to the amount of fuel carried; using the fuselage tank alone, fuel consumption had no appreciable effect on handling because the tank was at the centre of gravity, but with full wing tanks, directional control was compromised, especially in a dive. The flight controls were well harmonized and the aircraft was easy to control at high speed. The maximum dive speed tested was with no buffeting and excellent stability both in the dive (depending on fuel load) and as a gun platform.

==Operational history==
===France===

====Battle of France====
The &quot;Groupe de Chasse&quot; I/3 was the first unit to get the D.520, receiving its first aircraft in January 1940. These initial examples were unarmed and used for pilot training. In April and May 1940, operational units received 34 &#x27;war-capable&#x27; production D.520s; the type quickly proved to be highly popular with pilots and ground crew. During comparative trials on 21 April 1940 at CEMA at Orleans-Bricy against a captured Bf 109E-3, the German aircraft had a speed advantage owing to its more powerful engine. However, the D.520 had superior maneuverability, matching its turning circle, although displaying nasty characteristics when departing and spinning out of the turn repeatedly during the tests. The Bf 109, owing to its slats, could easily sustain the turn on the edge of a stall.
By 10 May 1940, when the Phoney War came to an end as Germany launched the invasion of France and the Low Countries, a total of 246 D.520s had been manufactured, but the French Air Force had accepted only 79 of these, as most others had been sent back to the factory to be retrofitted to the new standard. As a result, only GC I/3 was fully equipped, possessing a force of 36 aircraft. These met the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on 13 May, shooting down three Henschel Hs 126s and one Heinkel He 111 without suffering any losses. The next day, two D.520s were lost while a total of ten Luftwaffe aircraft (4 Messerschmitt Bf 110s, 2 Bf 109Es, 2 Dornier Do 17s, and 2 He 111s) were confirmed to be destroyed.

Four more &quot;Groupes de Chasse&quot; and three naval &quot;Escadrilles&quot; rearmed with the type before France&#x27;s surrender. GC II/3, GC III/3, GC III/6 and GC II/7 later completed conversion on the D.520. A naval unit, the &quot;1er Flotille de Chasse&quot;, was also equipped with the Dewoitine. However, only GC I/3, II/7, II/6 and the naval AC 1 saw any action in the Battle of France. GC III/7 converted to the D.520 too late to be involved in any action. In addition, several aircraft were flown by non-operational units, such as the special patrol of the École de l&#x27;air military school, as well as a handful flown by Polish and civilian pilots in defence of airstrips and production facilities in the vicinity of Toulouse.

In air combat, mostly against the Italians, the Dewoitine 520s claimed 114 air victories, plus 39 probables. Eighty five D.520s were lost. By the armistice at the end of June 1940, 437 D.520s had been constructed, 351 of these having been delivered. After the armistice, 165 D.520s were evacuated to North Africa. GC I/3, II/3, III/3, III/6 and II/7 flew their aircraft to Algeria to avoid capture. Three more, from GC III/7, escaped to Britain and were delivered to the Free French. A total of 153 D.520s remained in unoccupied mainland France.

One of the most successful D.520 pilots was Pierre Le Gloan, who shot 18 aircraft down (four Germans, seven Italian and seven British), scoring all but two of his kills with the D.520, and ranked as the fourth-highest French ace of the war.

====Under Vichy====
In April 1941, the German armistice commission authorized Vichy authorities to resume production of a batch of 1,000 military aircraft for their own use, under the condition that 2,000 German-designed aircraft would later be manufactured in France and delivered to Germany. As part of this agreement, 550 examples of the D.520 were ordered to replace all other single-seat fighters in service. However, no D.520 units were to be stationed on the French mainland, thus individual aircraft were instead stored or dispatched to units overseas, such as in North Africa.

The plan was to have the Dewoitine eventually equip a total of 17 &quot;Groupes&quot; with 442 aircraft, three &quot;escadrilles&quot; of the &quot;Aéronautique navale&quot; with 37 aircraft each, plus three training units with 13 aircraft. The agreement stated that aircraft of this new batch were to be similar to the ones already in service. From serial number 543 on, however, D.520s used the 12Y-49 engine that had a slightly higher rated performance than the 12Y-45, although the German Armistice Commission explicitly prohibited replacing the original power plants with the more powerful 12Y51 or 12Z engines.

In 1941, D.520s of GC III/6, II/3 and naval &quot;escadrille&quot; 1AC fought the Allies during the Syria–Lebanon campaign. The Vichy French Air Force was already relatively strong, but several units were sent to reinforce it. D.520s were the only French single-seat fighters capable of making the trip to Syria. The GC III/6 was sent first. The ferry trip was very difficult for a 1940 interceptor and the pilots pushed their planes as far as their fuel tanks would allow them to. They flew from France to Syria with intermediate stops at Rome, Brindisi or Catania. Another route was available through Germany and Greece (Athens), but it was seldom used. The trip always included a stopover in Rhodes (which had an Italian base at the time), before the final flight to Syria. This meant several thousand kilometers were flown over mountains and sea. The most demanding part was Catania-Rhodes, which entailed no less than flown over water. Even the trip from Rhodes to Syria was . LeO 451s and Martin 167F bombers had few problems, but D.520s were forced to fly a strenuous and dangerous mission, without any help or external assistance. Of the 168 French aircraft (of all types) sent to Syria, 155 accomplished their mission and arrived successfully. The Vichy Air force was numerically strong, but with very few ground crew and spare parts, which meant that the operational flying time for the D.520s was very limited. D.520s of GC III/6 first saw action against British aircraft on 8 June 1941, when they shot down three Fairey Fulmars, losing one D.520 (its pilot was taken prisoner). Over the following days several escort missions were flown to protect Martin, LeO and Bloch 200 (3/39 Esc) bombers from British Royal Navy fighters. Two Hurricanes were shot down (with another D.520 lost) on 9 June.

During the Syria campaign, a total of 266 missions were conducted by the Vichy French Air Force: 99 of them were carried out by D.520s, nine by MS.406s, 46 by Martin 167s and 31 by LeO 451s. On 10 July, five D.520s attacked Bristol Blenheim bombers from No. 45 Squadron RAF that were being escorted by seven Curtiss Tomahawks from No. 3 Squadron RAAF (3 Sqn). The French pilots claimed three Blenheims, but at least four of the D.520s were destroyed by the Australian escorts, including two by flying officer Peter Turnbull. The following day, a Dewoitine pilot shot a P-40 down from 3 Sqn, the only Tomahawk lost during the campaign. This Dewoitine was in turn shot down by F/O Bobby Gibbes. The initial advantage that the Vichy French Air Force enjoyed did not last long, and they lost most of their aircraft during the campaign. The majority of them were destroyed on the ground where the flat terrain, absence of infrastructure and absence of modern anti-aircraft (AA) artillery made them vulnerable to air attacks. On 26 June, a strafing run by Tomahawks of 3 Sqn, on Homs airfield, destroyed five D.520s of Fighter Squadron II/3 (Groupe de Chasse II/3) and damaged six more.
By the end of the campaign, Vichy forces had lost 179 aircraft from the approximately 289 committed to the Levant. The remaining aircraft with the range to do so, evacuated to Rhodes. The known French losses of fighter aircraft were 26 in air combat and 45 in strafing and bombing actions. The Allies lost 41 planes, 27 of those shot down by French fighters. During Operation Torch (the invasion of North Africa), GC III/3 (previously known as GC I/3), was engaged in combat with the Allies over Oran. &quot;Flotille&quot; 1F saw action against the United States Navy Grumman F4F Wildcat squadron VF-41 (from the carrier ), over Casablanca. One D.520 was among fourteen US victory claims; the only Allied losses were due to ground and friendly fire. Other Dewoitine-equipped units in North Africa such as GC II/7 or GC II/3 did not take part in the fighting. Overall, the known D.520 air strength in North Africa was 173 D.520s (143 combat ready) of GC II/3, III/3, III/6, II/7 and II/5; another 30 were in Senegal with GC II/6. The Navy had Esc 1AC and 2AC. Many D.520s were destroyed on the ground by Allied bombing. The French Air Force lost 56 aircraft, among them 13 D.520s. The Navy lost 19 D.520s. Among the 44 kills that the French scored overall, there were five losses from fighters and flak out of a squadron of eight Fairey Albacores from , some of which were shot down by D.520s of GC III/3.

====Free French Dewoitines====
A very small number of D.520s were briefly operated by Free French Forces for training purposes. Along with the three examples that had flown to Britain in June 1940, two other Dewoitines were recovered from retreating Vichy forces in Rayak, Lebanon. These D.520s were flown by pilots of the &quot;Normandie-Niemen&quot; unit before it was sent to the USSR, where they flew the Yakovlev Yak-1 that had many similarities with the French aircraft.

===With the Allies===
In December 1942, as French forces formerly under Vichy sided with the Allies, there were 153 D.520s left in French hands in North Africa. They flew a few patrols during the Tunisia campaign, but were considered obsolete, and their radio sets were incompatible with Allied equipment. From early 1943 on, they were relegated to training duties at the fighter school in Meknes, and progressively replaced by Supermarine Spitfires and Bell P-39 Airacobras in combat units.

During the liberation of France, a few D.520s abandoned by the Germans, were used by &quot;ad hoc&quot; units in ground attacks against the isolated German pockets of resistance on the Western coast. Around 55 such aircraft were recovered from the Luftwaffe by the rapid advance of the Allies. Commanded by former test pilot Marcel Doret, one such unit attacked German forces at Royan and Pointe de Grave, performing strafing runs upon enemy artillery positions, as well as providing air cover for Allied bombers. After 1 December 1944, the date on which the French Air Force was officially reformed, Doret&#x27;s unit became G.C.II/18; it continued to operate D.520s for several months before being reequipped with Spitfires on 1 March 1945.

===&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; Dewoitines===

About 60 D.520s were acquired by the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (the Italian Air Force or RA). Italian pilots appreciated the aircraft&#x27;s capabilities and Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon, at least by 1940–1941 standards. The first three D.520s were assigned to 2° &quot;Stormo&quot; based at the Torino-Caselle airfield, where they were used for the defence of Torino&#x27;s industrial area. Other D.520s were captured in Montélimar, Orange, Istres and Aix-en-Provence.
At the beginning of 1943, the Italian ace Luigi Gorrini ferried D.520s taken as prizes of war to Italy to be used for defence. &quot;I have collected several dozen Dewoitines from various French airfields and the Toulouse factory&quot;, he recalled later. &quot;At the time, when we were still flying the Macchi C.200, it was a good, if not very good, machine. Compared to the Macchi 200, it was superior only in one point: its armament of the Hispano-Suiza HS 404 cannon.&quot; Italian pilots liked the gun, the modern cockpit, the excellent radio set and the easy recovery from a spin but they also complained about the weak undercarriage and the small [cannon] ammunition drum capability; the ammunition was not available in quantities (the HS.404 was not compatible with Breda and Scotti guns, so everything depended on France&#x27;s depots). At the end of February the 359a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; (22° &quot;Gruppo&quot;), led by Major Vittorio Minguzzi, received eight Dewoitine D.520. At that time, American B-24s frequently bombed Naples, so an effective interceptor was badly needed, and D.520s were all that were available in early 1943. The 359a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; pilots used Dewoitines with some success. 

On 1 March 1943, Maggiore Minguzzi claimed a B-24 while flying a D.520. This claim was initially only claimed as a probable but was later upgraded to a confirmed. This was probably the first Italian claim using this aircraft.
On 21 May 1943, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; agreed to exchange 39 Lioré et Olivier LeO 451s, captured by the Italians at the SNCASE factory in Ambérieu-en-Bugey (Lyon), with a stock of 30 D.520s. Subsequently, in the spring and summer of 1943, the Dewoitines were used by 161° &quot;Gruppo Autonomo&quot;, based in southern Italy with 163a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; in Grottaglie, 162a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; in Crotone and 164a &quot;Squadriglia&quot; in Reggio Calabria.
On 31 July 1943, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; still had 47 Dewoitines in service. After the armistice of 8 September 1943, three D.520s, previously in service with 24° &quot;Gruppo&quot;, were used by the Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana of the Italian Social Republic for training.

===Other foreign users===
German forces invading Vichy&#x27;s so-called &quot;free zone&quot; in November 1942, captured 246 D.520s; additionally, a batch of 62 was completed under German occupation. The captured Dewoitines were to be delivered to the Axis Balkan Front, although some were used by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; for training purposes while 60 were transferred to Italy and 96, or 120, to the Bulgarian Air Force for use in combat. However, D.520s reached Bulgaria only in August 1943, as the fighter pilots of that country were still training on the type at Nancy with JG 107.

The following month, the first 48 Dewoitines were taken over in a ceremony on Karlovo airfield. Two months later, on 24 November, the D.520s were used in combat, when 17 out of the 60 B-24 Liberators of the 15th USAAF arrived over the capital, Sofia, to bomb it. Twenty four Dewoitines took off from Vrazhdebna base (along with 16 Bf 109G-2s from Bojourishte) and attacked the bombers and their 35 escorting P-38 Lightnings. The Bulgarian pilots claimed four American aircraft for the loss of one fighter, three more had to force land. American bombers attacked Sofia again, on 10 December 1943. That day, 31 B-24s escorted by P-38s, were intercepted by six Dewoitines of the II/6th Fighter Regiment from Vrazhdebna and 16 D.520s of the I/6th Fighter Regiment from Karlovo (along with 17 Bf 109G-2s). The Americans claimed 11 D.520s for the loss of only one P-38. The later examination of records showed that only one Dewoitine was lost during that air battle.

The Bulgarian Air Force D.520s were again up in force, to face the massive Allied air raid of 30 March 1944. To intercept the 450 bombers (B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24s and Handley Page Halifaxes) escorted by 150 P-38s, the Bulgarians scrambled 28 Dewoitines from I./6th at Karlovo, six D.520s from II/6th at Vrazhdebna (together with 39 Bf 109G-6s and even Avia 135s). At least ten Allied aircraft (eight bombers and two P-38s) were shot down, while the Bulgarian Air Force lost five fighters and three pilots. Two more Bulgarian aircraft had to force land.
During the last Allied raid on Sofia, on 17 April, the II./6th fighter scrambled seven Dewoitines (plus 16 Bf 109s), against 350 B-17s and B-24s escorted by 100 P-51 Mustangs. Bulgarian pilots, who up to that time had encountered only P-38s, mistook the P-51s for their own Bf 109s and before they realized their mistake, seven Bf 109G-6s had been shot down. That day the Bulgarian Air Force suffered the heaviest losses since the beginning of the war: nine fighters shot down and three that had to crash land. Six pilots lost their lives.
By 28 September 1944, twenty days after Bulgaria joined the Allies, Dewoitines still equipped an &quot;Orlyak&quot; (Group) of the 6th Fighter regiment: I Group had a total of 17 D.520s, five under repair and 12 operational, for its three &quot;Jato&quot; (Squadrons).

Numerous sources have mentioned use of the D.520 by the Romanian Air Force, but no evidence has ever been provided. One source claims the so-called Romanian Dewoitines were, in fact, in transit to Bulgaria and only flew over Romania in order to get to their final destination. This seems the most reliable explanation, viewed against the numbers of Dewoitines actually available. Romania did however use the French Bloch MB.150.

===Postwar service===
After the war, the D.520s that remained in France were used as trainers; on 1 June 1945, the school base No. 704 was formed at Tours for the purpose of training pilot instructors operating, amongst other types, 17 D.520s. At the encouragement of No. 704&#x27;s commanding office, one D.520 was field-modified into a two-seater configuration in late 1945, which was subsequently designated as the D.520 DC. In March 1946, after further experiments, the French Air Force ordered a further batch of 20 D.520s to be likewise converted; however, only 13 of these D.520 DC conversions were completed.

The last unit to fly the D.520 was the EPAA (&quot;Équipes de présentation de l&#x27;armée de l&#x27;air&quot;), No. 58. In their final years, the remaining examples were often unserviceable due to general wear and tear. The last flight of an operational D.520 was made on 3 September 1953 with EPAA (&quot;Équipes de présentation de l&#x27;armée de l&#x27;air&quot;). Initially, this unit had flown Yak-3s, formerly of the Normandie-Niemen fighter squadron; these were later replaced with seven D.520s, three of them being two-seaters.

==Markings==
Apart from the first prototype and postwar examples, D.520s sported the usual French camouflage of dark blue-grey, khaki, and dark brown with light blue-grey undersurfaces. The camouflage pattern was not standardized. National markings were the standard light-blue-white-red roundels on the wingtips, as well as on the rear fuselage, and the rudder flag.

Specific markings were applied during the Vichy era, consisting of white outlined fuselage roundels with a white fuselage stripe, and from mid-1941 on, the infamous &quot;slave&#x27;s pajamas&quot; with red and yellow stripes on the engine cowling and tail surfaces.

<doc id="182288" wikidata="Q167286" url="?curid=182288" title="Dornier Do 335">
<text>The Dornier Do 335 &quot;Pfeil&quot; (Arrow) is a heavy fighter built by Dornier for Germany during World War II. The &quot;Pfeil&quot;″s performance was predicted to be better than other twin-engine designs due to its unusual push-pull configuration and the lower aerodynamic drag of the in-line alignment of the two engines. It was Nazi Germany&#x27;s fastest piston-engined aircraft of World War II. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was desperate to get the design into operational use, but delays in engine deliveries meant that only a handful were delivered before the war ended.

The Do 335 was originally designed as a Schnellbomber. It could reach speeds of around 800 km/h in level flight, and could outrun most of the military aircraft in service at the time, with only first generation jet fighters being faster. The front engine of the Pfeil was the Daimler-Benz DB 605, and the rear one the DB 605 QA.

==Design and development==
The origin of the Do 335 goes back to World War I when Claude Dornier designed a number of flying boats with tandem engines. These were used on most of the multi-engined Dornier flying boats that followed, including the highly successful Do J &quot;Wal&quot; and the gigantic Do X.
The main advantage of this arrangement is the reduced drag due to the smaller frontal area. It also keeps the weight of the twin powerplants near, or on, the aircraft centerline, increasing the roll rate compared to a traditional twin. In addition, a single engine failure does not lead to asymmetric thrust, and in normal flight there is no net torque, so the aircraft is easier to handle. The ventral fin–rudder of the cruciform tail protected the rear propeller from accidentally striking on takeoff. The presence of the rear pusher propeller also necessitated the provision for an ejection seat for safe escape from a damaged aircraft, and designing the rear propeller and dorsal fin mounts to use explosive bolts to jettison them before an ejection was attempted – as well as twin canopy jettison levers, one per side located to either side of the forward cockpit interior just below the sills of the five-panel windscreen&#x27;s sides, to jettison the canopy from atop the cockpit before ejection.

In 1939, Dornier, reviving a principle he had patented in 1937, was working on the P.59 high-speed bomber project, which used the tandem engine layout. In 1940, he commissioned a test aircraft, closely modeled on the airframe of the early versions of the Dornier Do 17 bomber but only 40% of the size, with no aerodynamic bodies of any sort on the wing panels (the Do 17 had twin engine nacelles on its wings) and fitted with a retractable tricycle landing gear to validate his concept for turning the rear pusher propeller with an engine located far away from it, through the use of a long tubular driveshaft. This aircraft, the Göppingen Gö 9, showed no unforeseen difficulties with this arrangement, but work on the P.59 was stopped in early 1940 when Hermann Göring ordered the cancellation of all projects that would not be completed within a year or so.

In May 1942, Dornier submitted an updated version with a bomb load as the P.231, in response to a requirement for a single seat, &quot;Schnellbomber&quot;-like high-speed bomber/intruder. The P.231 proposal was selected as the winner after beating rival designs from Arado, Junkers, and Blohm &amp; Voss. A development contract was awarded, by the RLM issuing the Dornier firm the airframe approval number &quot;8-335&quot;, for what would become known as the Do 335. In autumn 1942, Dornier was told that the Do 335 was no longer required, and instead a multi-role fighter based on the same general layout would be accepted. This delayed the prototype delivery as it was modified for the new role.


When fitted with DB 603A engines delivering it had a pair of the largest inverted V12 aircraft engines mass-produced during the Third Reich&#x27;s existence. The Do 335 V1 first prototype CP+UA, flew on 26 October 1943 under the control of &quot;Flugkapitän&quot; Hans Dieterle, a regular Heinkel test pilot and later primary Dornier test pilot. However, several problems during the initial flight of the Do 335 would continue to plague the aircraft through most of its short history. Issues were found with the weak landing gear and with the main gear&#x27;s wheel well doors, resulting in them being removed for the remainder of the V1&#x27;s test flights. The Do 335 V1 made 27 flights, flown by three different pilots. During these test flights the second prototype, V2 (&quot;Werk Nr&quot; 230002) CP+UB, was completed and made its first flight on 31 December 1943, again under the control of Dieterle. New to the V2 were upgraded DB 603A-2 engines, and several refinements learned from the test flights of the V1 as well as further windtunnel testing. On 20 January 1944, the Do 335 V3 (&quot;W.Nr.&quot; 230004), CP+UC was completed and flown for its first time by Werner Altrogge. The V3 was powered by the new pre-production DB 603G-0 engines which could produce at take-off and featured a slightly redesigned canopy which included twin rear-view mirrors in blisters, one in each of two matching side panels of the well-framed, eleven-panel main canopy&#x27;s openable section. Following the flights of the V3, in mid January 1944, RLM ordered five more prototypes (V21–V25), to be built as night fighters. By this time, more than 60 hours of flight time had been put on the Do 335 and reports showed it to be a good handling, but more importantly, very fast aircraft, described by &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erhard Milch himself as &quot;...holding its own in speed and altitude with the P-38 and it does not suffer from engine reliability issues&quot;. The Do 335 was scheduled to begin mass construction, with the initial order of 120 preproduction aircraft to be manufactured by &quot;Dornier-Werke Friedrichshafen&quot; (DWF) to be completed no later than March 1946. This number included a number of bombers, destroyers (heavy fighters), and several yet to be developed variants. At the same time, &quot;Dornier-Werke München&quot; (DWM) was scheduled to build over 2,000 Do 335s in various models, due for delivery in March 1946 as well.
On 23 May 1944, Hitler, as part of the developing &quot;Jägernotprogramm&quot; (Emergency Fighter Program) directive, which took effect on 3 July, ordered maximum priority to be given to Do 335 production. The main production line was intended to be at Manzell, but a bombing raid in March destroyed the tooling and forced Dornier to set up a new line at Oberpfaffenhofen. The decision was made, along with the rapid shut-down of many other military aircraft development programs, to cancel the Heinkel He 219 night fighter, which also used the DB 603 engines (in well-unitized installations), and use its production facilities for the Do 335 as well. However, Ernst Heinkel managed to delay, and eventually ignore, its implementation, continuing to produce examples of the He 219A.

At least 16 prototype Do 335s were known to have flown (V1–V12, W.Nr 230001-230012 and &quot;Muster&quot;-series prototypes M13–M17, W.Nr 230013–230017) on a number of DB603 engine subtypes including the DB 603A, A-2, G-0, E and E-1. The first preproduction Do 335 (A-0s) starting with W.Nr 240101, &quot;Stammkennzeichen&quot; VG+PG, were delivered in July 1944. Approximately 22 preproduction aircraft were thought to have been completed and flown before the end of the war, including approximately 11 A-0s converted to A-11s for training purposes. One such aircraft was transferred to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and later, after a rear-engine fire burnt through the elevator controls during a flight, crashed onto a local school.

==Flight tests==
The first 10 Do 335 A-0s were delivered for testing in May 1944. Do 335 V3, (T9+ZH), W.Nr. 230003 was delivered to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s experimental reconnaissance unit, 1./Versuchsverband OKL, in late May. However, it suffered constant problems and was returned to Dornier in September. By late 1944, the Do 335 A-1 was on the production line. It was similar to the A-0 but with the uprated DB 603E-1 engines of around take-off power rating on 87 octane fuel, and two underwing hardpoints for additional bombs, drop tanks or guns. It had a maximum speed of at with MW 50 boost, or without boost, and climbed to in under 15 minutes. Even with one engine out, it reached about .

==Operational History==

Delivery commenced in January 1945. When the United States Army overran the Oberpfaffenhofen factory in late April 1945, only 11 Do 335 A-1 single-seat fighter-bombers and two Do 335 A-12 trainers had been completed. The two-seater trainer version was called &quot;Ameisenbär&quot; (&quot;anteater&quot;).

French ace Pierre Clostermann claimed the first Allied combat encounter with a &quot;Pfeil&quot; in April 1945. He described leading a flight of four Hawker Tempests from No. 3 Squadron RAF over northern Germany when they came across an unknown aircraft whose description matched the Do 335&#x27;s, flying at maximum speed at treetop level. Detecting the British aircraft, the German pilot reversed course to evade. Two pilots fired on the Dornier but Clostermann, despite the Tempests&#x27; considerable low altitude speed, decided not to attempt to chase it as it was obviously much faster.

On 26 April 1945, the Do 335 V9, which was still at Rechlin, was test-flown by Oberleutnant Heinrich Schild. Later that day he escorted Hanna Reitsch and General der Flieger Robert von Greim&#x27;s flight to Berlin-Gatow. After arriving at Gatow, Reitsch and von Greim commandeered a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch and flew to Hitler&#x27;s bunker. Also on 26 April, Fliegerstabsing. Heinz Fischer attempted to fly Do 335 V9 from Rechlin to Switzerland. Due to a compass failure, he strayed over France and ran out of fuel. Both the ejector seat and the tail jettison mechanism failed and he had to bail out over the Vosges mountains.

==Proposed developments==
===Do 635===
In 1944, Junkers helped Dornier with work on the Do 335 Zwilling or Dornier Do 635. This consisted of two Do 335 fuselages joined by a common centre wing section, with two Rb 50 cameras in the port fuselage for aerial photography. Armament was confined to provision for five photo-flash bombs. A meeting was arranged between Junkers and Heinkel engineers, and after the meeting, they began work on the project, named 1075 01–21. The designer, Professor Heinrich Hertel, planned a test flight in late 1945. At the end of 1944, the Germans reviewed aircraft designs with the Japanese military. Among other projects, the Do 635 impressed the Japanese military with its capabilities and design. The mainwheels were common with Ju 352 wheels. It was also intended that two monopropellant Walter &quot;Starthilfe&quot; RATOG units would be fitted. In early 1945, a wind-tunnel model was tested, and a cockpit mockup was constructed. Following an order from the Rüstungsstab on the 15 March, it was decided that Junkers continue with the project, but only by using the simplest production methods. However, none had been completed by the wars end.

===P 256===
The P 256 was to meet a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; requirement issued 27 February 1945. It was designed to carry a crew of three (pilot, radar operator, and navigator), with pilot and radar operator together under the canopy, while the navigator was in the fuselage, an idea copied from Arado. Departing from centerline thrust, it was to have two Heinkel HeS 011 engines of each, podded under the wings in the fashion of the Me 262. The low-mounted wing was unswept, and had an aspect ratio of 5.8:1. Designed armament was four MK 108 cannon in the nose. A field conversion kit was to retrofit two MK 108s in a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; configuration. A fighter-bomber variant would have carried two bombs. Its loaded weight would have included of fuel, giving a wing loading of . Maximum speed was achieved at , maximum range at . Endurance with fuel was calculated as 2.6 hours. Its electronics would have included FuG 24SE with ZVG 24, FuG 29, FuG 25a or c, and FuG 244 &quot;Bremen&quot; with &quot;Gnome&quot; weapon triggers. Criticized for having poor cross-sectional area and unduly large tail surfaces, it was not adopted.

==Surviving aircraft==
Only one Do 335 survives, the second preproduction Do 335 A-0, designated A-02, with construction number 240 102=. The aircraft was assembled at the Dornier plant in Oberpfaffenhofen, Bavaria on 16 April 1945. It was captured by Allied forces on 22 April. It was one of two Do 335s to be shipped to the United States along with other captured German aircraft, to be used for testing and evaluation under a USAAF program called &quot;Operation Lusty&quot;. One Do 335 (registration FE-1012) went to the USAAF and was tested in early 1946 at Freeman Field, Indiana, USA. Its fate is not recorded.

VG+PH went to the Navy for evaluation and was sent to the Test and Evaluation Center, Patuxent River Naval Air Station, Maryland, USA. Following testing from 1945 to 1948, the aircraft languished in outside storage at Naval Air Station Norfolk. In 1961, it was donated to the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air Museum, though it remained in deteriorating condition at Norfolk for several more years before being moved to the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s storage facility in Suitland, Maryland. In October 1974, VG+PH was returned to the Dornier plant in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany (then building the Alpha Jet) for a complete restoration. In 1975, the aircraft was restored by Dornier employees, many of whom had worked on the airplane originally. They were surprised that the explosive charges built into the aircraft to blow off the dorsal fin and rear propeller prior to pilot ejection were still intact.

Following restoration the completed aircraft was displayed at the Hannover, Germany Airshow from 1 May to 9 May 1976. After the air show, the aircraft was loaned to the Deutsches Museum in Munich, where it was on display until 1988, when it was shipped back to Silver Hill, Maryland. It can be seen today in the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum alongside other unique late-war German aircraft, including the only known example of the Arado Ar 234 B-2 &quot;Blitz&quot; jet reconnaissance-bomber, and the fully restored fuselage and tail surfaces of the only complete surviving Heinkel He 219A &quot;Uhu&quot; (Eagle-Owl) night fighter.

<text>The Ilyushin Il-4 (DB-3F) (; NATO reporting name: Bob) is a Soviet twin-engined long-range bomber and torpedo bomber, widely used by the Soviet Air Force and Soviet Naval Aviation during World War II.

==Design and development==
In 1938, the Ilyushin design bureau redesigned the Ilyushin DB-3 to ease production and improve its performance, the revised version receiving the designation DB-3F (&quot;Forsirovanniye&quot; or &quot;boosted&quot;). The aircraft&#x27;s internal structure, particularly the wings, was extensively changed, eliminating the need for hand finishing of the structure, and with duralumin replacing the large scale use of steel in the earlier version. The aircraft&#x27;s fuel system was redesigned, increasing its internal capacity while reducing the number of fuel tanks. The fuselage nose was lengthened to give more room for the navigator/bombardier while reducing drag. The prototype DB-3F, powered by the same Tumansky M-87B engines of the DB-3M, was piloted on its maiden flight by Vladimir Kokkinaki on 21 May 1939. It successfully passed through state acceptance tests and entered production in January 1940, with the Tumansky M-88 quickly replacing the M-87. The DB-3F was redesignated Il-4 in March 1942. Some series had wooden outer wings and front fuselages to conserve metals, and throughout the production, engines and fuel tanks were upgraded for improved performance while retaining the same range. However the most notable change was the addition of larger defensive guns in the turret, using the 12.7 mm (0.5 in) UBT machine gun in place of the earlier 7.62 mm (0.3 in) weapons. In addition, it was found that the gunners were attacked first, so blocks of armor were placed around the gunner positions.

This extra weight was not offset by the newer engines however, and the Il-4 proved to be slower than the earlier versions at only 404 km/h (251 mph). An attempt to improve performance was made as the Il-6, adding large diesel engines and heavier armament. The engines proved unreliable and production was never started. The Il-4 remained in production until 1945, when just over 5,200 had been built.

==Operational history==

=== Soviet Union ===
Although the Il-4 was only a medium bomber, it had the range to be used on strategic missions. The use of the bombers in this role was not a priority for the VVS, but nevertheless the Il-4 was used on several long-range bombing raids against Berlin in 1941. Most would be used on much shorter range missions, often adding another 1,000 kg (2,204 lb) of bombs under the wings, in addition to the internal 2,500 kg (5,512 lb).

=== Finland ===
Finland bought four captured DB-3Fs from German stocks. These were given the Finnish Air Force serials DF-22 to DF-25 and flown from Bryansk, Russia to Finland (one aircraft, DF-22, was destroyed en route and crashed near Syeschtschinskaya airfield). The aircraft were later flown by No. 48 Sqn during 1943 (DF-23, DF-24 and DF-25), No. 46 Sqn during 1944 (DF-23 and DF-24) and No. 45 Sqn for a short time in 1945 (DF-23), until the last remaining serviceable aircraft went into depot on 23 February 1945. After the war, DF-25 was lost in a snowstorm, landed on the ice and crashed into the woods in Öja near the city of Kokkola. Most parts of the plane were rescued and taken to a depot.

<text>Simeon () is a given name, from the Hebrew (Biblical &quot;Šimʿon&quot;, Tiberian &quot;Šimʿôn&quot;), usually transliterated in English as Shimon. In Greek, it is written Συμεών, hence the Latinized spelling Symeon. It is a cognate of the name Simon.

==Meaning==
The name is derived from Simeon, son of Jacob and Leah, patriarch of the Tribe of Simeon. The text of Genesis (29:33) argues that the name of &quot;Simeon&quot; refers to Leah&#x27;s belief that God had heard that she was hated by Jacob, in the sense of not being as favoured as Rachel.

Implying a derivation from the Hebrew term &quot;shama on&quot;, meaning &quot;he has heard&quot;; this is a similar etymology as the Torah gives for the theophoric name &quot;Ishmael&quot; (&quot;God has heard&quot;; Genesis 16:11), on the basis of which it has been argued that the tribe of Simeon may originally have been an Ishmaelite group (Cheyne and Black, &quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica&quot;). Alternatively, Hitzig, W. R. Smith, Stade, and Kerber compared שִׁמְעוֹן &quot;Šīmə‘ōn&quot; to Arabic سِمع &quot;simˤ&quot; &quot;the offspring of the hyena and the female wolf&quot;; as supports, Smith points to Arabic tribal names &quot;Simˤ&quot; &quot;a subdivision of the defenders (the Medinites)&quot; and &quot;Samˤān&quot; &quot;a subdivision of Tamim&quot;.

In classical rabbinical sources, the name is sometimes interpreted as meaning &quot;he who listens [to the words of God]&quot; (Genesis Rabbah 61:4), and at other times thought to derive from &quot;sham &#x27;in&quot;, meaning &quot;there is sin&quot;, which is argued to be a prophetic reference to Zimri&#x27;s sexual miscegenation with a Midianite woman, a type of relationship which rabbinical sources regard as sinful (&quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;).

<doc id="182296" wikidata="Q707868" url="?curid=182296" title="Junkers Ju 388">
<text>The Junkers Ju 388 &quot;Störtebeker&quot; is a World War II German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; multi-role aircraft based on the Ju 88 airframe by way of the Ju 188. It differed from its predecessors in being intended for high altitude operation, with design features such as a pressurized cockpit for its crew. The Ju 388 was introduced very late in the war, and production problems along with the deteriorating war conditions meant that few were built.

==Background==
The &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM), the Reich Aviation Ministry, first learned of the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress heavy bomber in late 1942. Serious concerns as to B-29 capability developed in early 1944, when YB-29 &quot;Hobo Queen&quot; made a well-publicised appearance at RAF Bovingdon, which had been cryptically hinted at in an American-published &quot;Sternenbanner&quot; German language propaganda leaflet from Leap Year Day in 1944, meant to be circulated within the Reich.

The performance estimates of this aircraft were a cause for great unease in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The B-29 had a maximum speed of around 560 km/h (350 mph), and would attack in a cruise of about 360 km/h (225 mph) at , an altitude where no current &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft was effective, and for which the only effective Wehrmacht anti-aircraft gun was the rarely-deployed 12.8 cm FlaK 40, which could effectively fire to an altitude of .

To counter the B-29, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; would need new day fighters and bomber destroyers with greatly enhanced performance at extreme altitude. The fighter chosen was the Focke-Wulf Ta 152H, a derivative of the Fw 190D with a longer wingspan and powered by the new high-altitude model &quot;E&quot; of the Junkers Jumo 213 engine. An alternative fighter model was the Messerschmitt Me 155B, a long-winged development of the Bf 109, which had already undergone several stages of design and would ultimately be built in prototype form by Blohm &amp; Voss. The centre-line thrust, twin-engined Dornier Do 335, powered with two of the competing Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines also offered a service ceiling of some 11,400 m (37,500 ft), but the promising Dornier heavy fighter and &quot;zerstörer&quot; was still under development with only prototype airframes flying, and the first production examples expected to enter operational service late in 1944.

For the bomber destroyer and night fighter roles, the all-wood Focke-Wulf Ta 154 and metal-structured Heinkel He 219 had the performance needed to catch the bomber; however, both designs only gained that performance by mounting low aspect ratio wings which were inadequate for flight at high altitude and resultingly produced too high a wing loading. The Junkers Ju 88 had already been modified for high-altitude with as the S and T models, but these did not have the performance needed. Similar high-altitude modifications to the Ju 188, with its complex stepless cockpit glazing comprising some three dozen framed window panels in all, were being looked at as the projected Ju 188J, K and L models, which included a simplified &quot;stepless&quot; pressurized cockpit that fully enclosed the entire nose using fewer glazed panels in comparison to the Ju 188&#x27;s glazing design, and wing and elevator de-icing equipment for extended flights at very high altitude. These were selected for development, and renamed Ju 388.

==Development==
In order to improve performance, the Ju 388 was stripped of almost all defensive armament. Whereas the Ju 88 included a number of manually operated guns in ports around the cockpit area, on the Ju 388 they were replaced by a single remote-control turret in the tail containing two 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns, aimed via a periscope in the cockpit, mounted one-above-the-other, as had been done experimentally with a few Heinkel He 177A heavy bombers&#x27; manned tail defensive gun positions. The Ju 388&#x27;s remote tail turret had an excellent field of fire and could shoot directly to the rear, so the &quot;Bola&quot; streamlined defensive armament position under the nose of Ju 88s and 188s was omitted, improving the aerodynamics.

The aircraft was to be delivered using the same naming as the three original Ju 188 experimental versions: the J, K, and L. The J model was a fighter with two 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 103 cannons and two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons in a solid nose for use as a daytime bomber destroyer. For use as a night fighter, the long-barreled MK 103s were replaced by the smaller and lighter 30 mm MK 108s, while a second pair of upward firing MK 108s were added in a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; installation behind the cockpit. The K model was a pure bomber, with a pannier under the plane increasing the size of the bomb bay. The L photo-reconnaissance model put its cameras in the pannier along with additional fuel tanks for long-range missions.

Three sub-models of each variant were planned, different only in the engine installation. The -1 would mount the 1,331 kW (1,810 PS) output BMW 801J, a turbocharged version of the basic BMW 801 air cooled radial, each engine installed as a unitized &quot;Triebwerksanlage&quot; engine installation. The -2 would use the 46.4 litre displacement, 1,864 kW (2,500 hp) Jumo 222A/B 24-cylinder six-bank liquid-cooled engines, or the identical displacement 222E/F versions with an improved two-speed supercharger with triple intercoolers on each engine. The -3 would mount the Junkers Jumo 213E liquid-cooled inverted V12, which included a supercharger similar to the 222E/F&#x27;s. Since the 24-cylinder Jumo 222 engine never progressed beyond development and testing with just under 300 units ever built, the only powerplants actually used for the Ju 388 would be the BMW 801 radial and Jumo 213 series V12s.

With the BMW 801J or Jumo 213E, the fighter versions flew at 616 km/h (383 mph) when equipped as a destroyer, losing about 25 km/h (16 mph) due to the eight-dipole &quot;Hirschgeweih&quot; antenna array used for late-war, VHF-band &quot;Neptun&quot; radar and &quot;Schräge Musik&quot; when equipped as night fighters. This was similar in speed to existing &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; night fighters, but the Ju 388 maintained this speed at much higher altitudes. With the Jumo 222 engine, the aircraft was estimated to be capable of reaching around 700 km/h (435 mph), again about 25 km/h (16 mph) less in night fighter versions. The bomber versions flew at roughly the same speeds depending on bombload, while the reconnaissance versions would have been about 25 km/h (16 mph) faster.

The first prototype, Ju 388 L-0/V7, mainly built from Ju 188 series production components, made its first flight on December 22, 1943. It demonstrated much better handling at altitude than the Ju 88S due to an increase in tail surface area, as the streamlined-nose Ju 88S, also omitting the &quot;Bola&quot; gondola, still used the original Ju 88A vertical tail surface design. This was followed by six new prototypes. It was some time before deliveries of the production models started due to engine delivery delays. By the time the engines were widely available, it was clear that B-29 bombers were actually being sent to the Asia and the Pacific and would not be operating over Germany anytime soon. German photo-reconnaissance efforts had practically disappeared due to the increased performance of the Allied defenses, so production mostly concentrated on the L model.

Deliveries started in August 1944 but few Ju 388s were completed. About 47 L models seem to have been built, the majority as -1s with the BMW 801J engine, and just three -3s with the Jumo 213E. Fifteen K-1s were built; and only three J-1 models were produced.

==Production==
The exact number of Ju 388s built is difficult to determine. One of the reasons is that various pre-series aircraft were used as prototypes, and some were damaged or destroyed by Allied bombs before completion. Furthermore, several official records terminate before the end of production or contradict each other.

Based on available documentation and research the following can be assumed as proven:

* 6 Ju 388 prototypes, 2 each for J-1, K-1 and L-1
* 20 Ju 388L-0, including prototypes V7, V8, V30 - V34
* 10 Ju 388K-0, first batch, including two converted to the Ju 488 V401/V402 prototypes (never flown)
* 1 Ju 388K-1 manufactured by ATG for static tests in July 1944
* 46 Ju 388L-1 manufactured by ATG in 1944
* 8+ Ju 388L-1 manufactured by ATG in 1945
* 10 Ju 388L-1 (max.) manufactured by Weserflug (WFG), initially planned as K-1

More aircraft and prototypes were planned and partially completed:
* 10 Ju 388K-0, second batch, some prototypes, partially completed
* 30 Ju 388K-0, third batch, planned, only few units completed

Also, an unknown number of Ju 388L-1 and Ju 388J were in advanced stages of production by the end of the war.

===Proposed export to Japan===
In August 1944, Japanese Major-General Osamu Otani, a member of one of the commissions related to the Tripartite Pact and serving in Berlin, expressed interest in a license production of the Ju 388. Complete drawing sets for the Ju 388 were handed over to the Japanese as well as the rights for licensed production. No evidence exists that any documents were ever delivered. Otani was captured by allied forces in Berlin in May 1945.

==Surviving aircraft==

One Ju 388 survives today. The Ju 388L-1 reconnaissance version with construction number (&quot;Werknummer&quot;) 560049 was the eighth of the series manufactured at &quot;Weser Flugzeugbau&#x27;s&quot; Nordenham plant. Parts of the airframe were also built at ATG in Altenburg and at &quot;Niedersächsische Metallwerke Brinckmann &amp; Mergell&quot; in Hamburg-Harburg. The aircraft was completed early in 1945. It was captured by U.S. troops in May 1945 at the Junkers plant in Merseburg, then flown to Kassel/Waldau.

The aircraft was examined and test flown by &quot;Watson&#x27;s Whizzers&quot;, led by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Colonel Harold E. Watson, as part of Operation Lusty and it is believed that Watson himself flew in the aircraft in preparation for flying it directly back to the U.S. Instead, on 17 June 1945 the aircraft was flown to Cherbourg, France where it was shipped to the United States aboard the Royal Navy escort carrier together with other captured German aircraft for detailed evaluation in the U.S.

The aircraft was flown to Freeman Field in Indiana for evaluation, and in September 1945 made a flight demonstration for the press. The Ju 388 was flown for 10 hours of flight tests at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio with the &quot;foreign evaluation&quot; serial number FE-4010 (later changed to T2-4010). Following these tests the aircraft was displayed at the Dayton, Ohio Air Show at Wright Field in 1946 along with other captured German aircraft.

On 26 September 1946, 560049 was transferred to Orchard Place Airport in Park Ridge, Illinois, near the present O&#x27;Hare International Airport. This temporary storage facility was a vacant U.S. Government-owned factory previously used by the Chrysler Corporation to build the Douglas C-54. The Ju 388 was donated to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air Museum on 3 January 1949 and arrived at Silver Hill, Maryland, for storage in November 1954.

Today the aircraft is disassembled and remains in generally good condition, having never been stored outside. The cockpit area is in particularly good condition and complete with all instruments. The aircraft is just one of several unique German aircraft still awaiting restoration at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Silver Hill, Maryland, all intended to be transferred in the coming years to the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center&#x27;s restoration annex of the Smithsonian, on the Dulles International Airport property.

<doc id="182298" wikidata="Q100323023" url="?curid=182298" title="List of winners of the Boston Marathon">
<text>The Boston Marathon, one of the six World Marathon Majors, is a race which has been held in the Greater Boston area in Massachusetts since 1897, making it the oldest annual marathon in the world.
The event is held on Patriots&#x27; Day, which was April 19 (or April 20 if April 19 was a Sunday) until the implementation of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1971. Since 1971, except in 2020 (race not held) or 2021 (Columbus Day holiday), the Boston Marathon is held on the third Monday in April. Various factors meant that until 1957 the course varied in length, due to which the marathon recognizes several course records that are slower than previous records due to being run on longer courses. The first Boston Marathon included only 15 runners, all of whom were men, and was won by John McDermott. The race was cancelled twice, in 1918 because of World War I, where a ekiden-style relay was conducted of military teams, and in 2020, when Massachusetts authorities refused to allow the event to be conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The winners have represented 27 different countries: Americans have won the marathon the most, doing so on 108 occasions; Kenyans have won 34 times; and Canadians 21 times. Ernst van Dyk is the most successful individual athlete, having won the men&#x27;s wheelchair division ten times. The current course records are held by Geoffrey Mutai, Buzunesh Deba, Marcel Hug and Manuela Schär.

Clarence DeMar won the men&#x27;s open race seven times, more than any other runner, achieving his first victory in 1911 and his last in 1930. Women were only officially allowed to run the race beginning in 1972, though female runners had unofficially participated beginning in 1966 despite breaching the rules of the Amateur Athletic Union. The first six victories in the women&#x27;s open division, between 1966 and 1971, were officially recognized in 1996. Bobbi Gibb was the first woman to finish the race in 1966, while Nina Kuscsik was the first official winner in 1972. Catherine Ndereba&#x27;s four victories between 2000 and 2005 are the most in the women&#x27;s open division. The Boston Marathon became the first major marathon to include a wheelchair division, in 1975, which was won by Robert Hall, though the first person to complete the race in a wheelchair had been Eugene Roberts in 1970. The first female wheelchair finisher, Sharon Rahn, came in 1977. Ernst van Dyk&#x27;s ten wins in the men&#x27;s wheelchair division are the most of any athlete at Boston, while Jean Driscoll leads the women&#x27;s wheelchair division with seven wins, and holds the overall record for the most consecutive victories, also seven. A handcyclist division was recognized for the first time in 2017, though handcyclists had been taking part prior to that. Tom Davis has won the first three men&#x27;s handcyclist races since it was officially recognized in 2017, and still holds the course record as of 2024. Alicia Dana has won the women&#x27;s handcycle race three times, as of 2024, and set a course record each time.

The course was designed to replicate the original marathon in Greece; a hilly point-to-point race, and as such has not been the venue for many world records. Suh Yun-bok set the only World Athletics-ratified men&#x27;s open division world record in 1947, in a time of 2:25:39. Two apparent world record times set between 1951 and 1956 by Keizo Yamada and Antti Viskari were later struck when the course was found to be over short. In 1975, Liane Winter took advantage of a following wind to set a world record in the women&#x27;s open race of 2:42:24, and eight years later, Joan Benoit beat a world record that had only been set the day before at the London Marathon, finishing in 2:22:43. Since 1990, the Boston Marathon has been ineligible for world records, as the start and finish are too far away from each other, and the race is a net downhill. In 2011, Geoffrey Mutai won the race in 2:03:02, which was the world&#x27;s fastest time for the marathon, beating the official world record by 57 seconds.

<text>&quot;Screaming Jelly Babies&quot; (British English), also known as &quot;Growling Gummy Bears&quot; (American and Canadian English), is a classroom chemistry demonstration in which a piece of candy bursts loudly into flame when dropped into potassium chlorate. The experiment is practiced in schools around the world and is often used at open evenings to show the more engaging and entertaining aspects of science in secondary education settings.

The experiment shows the amount of energy there is in a piece of candy. Jelly babies or gummy bears are often used for theatrics. Potassium chlorate, a strong oxidising agent, rapidly oxidises the sugar in the candy causing it to burst into flames. The reaction produces a &quot;screaming&quot; sound as rapidly expanding gases are emitted from the test tube. The aroma of caramel is given off. Other carbohydrate or hydrocarbon containing substances can be dropped into test tubes of molten chlorate to produce similar results.

==Net reaction==

4 KClO3 (s) + C12H22O11 (s) + 6 O2 (g) → 4 KCl + 12 CO2 (g) + 11 H2O (g)

== Mechanism ==
The solid potassium chlorate is melted into a liquid.

KClO3 (s) + energy → K+ClO3− (l)

The liquid potassium chlorate decomposes into potassium perchlorate and potassium chloride.

4 KClO3 → KCl + 3 KClO4

The potassium perchlorate decomposes into potassium chloride and oxygen.

KClO4 → KCl + 2 O2

The sugar in the candy reacts with oxygen, forming water and carbon dioxide. The reaction is exothermic and produces heat, smoke, and fire.

C12H22O11 (s) + 12 O2 (g) → 12 CO2 (g) + 11 H2O (g) + energy.

== Safety measures ==

Care should be taken in performing this experiment, which should only be attempted by a professional. Potassium chlorate is a strong oxidizer and can cause fire or explosions. It is toxic by inhalation or ingestion and is hazardous to aquatic environments. Reagent grade potassium chlorate should be used. Upon completion of the demonstration, all chemicals should be disposed of in designated chemical waste containers to prevent harm to people or the environment.

All participants in the experiment should wear personal protective equipment, including eye protection, and should stand a safe distance away from the demonstration. A face-shield and heat resistant gloves should be worn by the person adding the jelly baby to the molten potassium chlorate.

== Variations ==
Deviation from the experiment is not recommended, and has been linked with accidents. Candy with low moisture content or high surface area may cause explosions.

<text>Food energy is chemical energy that animals (including humans) derive from their food to sustain their metabolism, including their muscular activity.

Most animals derive most of their energy from aerobic respiration, namely combining the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins with oxygen from air or dissolved in water. Other smaller components of the diet, such as organic acids, polyols, and ethanol (drinking alcohol) may contribute to the energy input. Some diet components that provide little or no food energy, such as water, minerals, vitamins, cholesterol, and fiber, may still be necessary to health and survival for other reasons. Some organisms have instead anaerobic respiration, which extracts energy from food by reactions that do not require oxygen.

The energy contents of a given mass of food is usually expressed in the metric (SI) unit of energy, the joule (J), and its multiple the kilojoule (kJ); or in the traditional unit of heat energy, the calorie (cal). In nutritional contexts, the latter is often (especially in US) the &quot;large&quot; variant of the unit, also written &quot;Calorie&quot; (with symbol Cal, both with capital &quot;C&quot;) or &quot;kilocalorie&quot; (kcal), and equivalent to 4184 J or 4.184 kJ. Thus, for example, fats and ethanol have the greatest amount of food energy per unit mass, , respectively. Proteins and most carbohydrates have about , though there are differences between different kinds. For example, the values for glucose, sucrose, and starch are respectively. The differing energy density of foods (fat, alcohols, carbohydrates and proteins) lies mainly in their varying proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates that are not easily absorbed, such as fibre, or lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals, contribute less food energy. Polyols (including sugar alcohols) and organic acids contribute and respectively.

The energy contents of a complex dish or meal can be approximated by adding the energy contents of its components.

== History and methods of measurement ==

===Direct calorimetry of combustion===

The first determinations of the energy content of food were made by burning a dried sample in a bomb calorimeter and measuring the temperature change in the water surrounding the apparatus, a method known as direct calorimetry.

===The Atwater system===
However, the direct calorimetric method generally overestimates the actual energy that the body can obtain from the food, because it also counts the energy contents of dietary fiber and other indigestible components, and does not allow for partial absorption and/or incomplete metabolism of certain substances. For this reason, today the energy content of food is instead obtained indirectly, by using chemical analysis to determine the amount of each digestible dietary component (such as protein, carbohydrates, and fats), and adding the respective food energy contents, previously obtained by measurement of metabolic heat released by the body. In particular, the fibre content is excluded. This method is known as the Modified Atwater system, after Wilbur Atwater who pioneered these measurements in the late 19th century.

The system was later improved by Annabel Merrill and Bernice Watt of the USDA, who derived a system whereby specific calorie conversion factors for different foods were proposed.

== Dietary sources of energy ==
The typical human diet consists chiefly of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water, ethanol, and indigestible components such as bones, seeds, and fibre (mostly cellulose). Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins typically comprise ninety percent of the dry weight of food. Ruminants can extract food energy from the respiration of cellulose because of bacteria in their rumens that decompose it into digestible carbohydrates. 

Other minor components of the human diet that contribute to its energy content are organic acids such as citric and tartaric, and polyols such as glycerol, xylitol, inositol, and sorbitol. 

Some nutrients have regulatory roles affected by cell signaling, in addition to providing energy for the body. For example, leucine plays an important role in the regulation of protein metabolism and suppresses an individual&#x27;s appetite. Small amounts of essential fatty acids, constituents of some fats that cannot be synthesized by the human body, are used (and necessary) for other biochemical processes.

The approximate food energy contents of various human diet components, to be used in package labeling according to the EU regulations and UK regulations, are:
(1) Some polyols, like erythritol, are not digested and should be excluded from the count.

(2) This entry exists in the EU regulations of 2008, but not in the UK regulations, according to which fibre shall not be counted.

More detailed tables for specific foods have been published by many organizations, such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization also has published a similar table.

Other components of the human diet are either noncaloric, or are usually consumed in such small amounts that they can be neglected.

== Energy usage in the human body ==
The food energy actually obtained by respiration is used by the human body for a wide range of purposes, including basal metabolism of various organs and tissues, maintaining the internal body temperature, and exerting muscular force to maintain posture and produce motion. About 20% is used for brain metabolism.

The conversion efficiency of energy from respiration into muscular (physical) power depends on the type of food and on the type of physical energy usage (e.g., which muscles are used, whether the muscle is used aerobically or anaerobically). In general, the efficiency of muscles is rather low: only 18 to 26% of the energy available from respiration is converted into mechanical energy. This low efficiency is the result of about 40% efficiency of generating ATP from the respiration of food, losses in converting energy from ATP into mechanical work inside the muscle, and mechanical losses inside the body. The latter two losses are dependent on the type of exercise and the type of muscle fibers being used (fast-twitch or slow-twitch). For an overall efficiency of 20%, one watt of mechanical power is equivalent to . For example, a manufacturer of rowing equipment shows calories released from &quot;burning&quot; food as four times the actual mechanical work, plus per hour, which amounts to about 20% efficiency at 250 watts of mechanical output. It can take up to 20 hours of little physical output (e.g., walking) to &quot;burn off&quot; more than a body would otherwise consume. For reference, each kilogram of body fat is roughly equivalent to 32,300 kilojoules of food energy (i.e., ).

==Recommended daily intake==
Many countries and health organizations have published recommendations for healthy levels of daily intake of food energy. For example, the United States government estimates needed for women and men, respectively, between ages 26 and 45, whose total physical activity is equivalent to walking around per day in addition to the activities of sedentary living. These estimates are for a &quot;reference woman&quot; who is tall and weighs and a &quot;reference man&quot; who is tall and weighs . Because caloric requirements vary by height, activity, age, pregnancy status, and other factors, the USDA created the DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals in order to determine individual caloric needs.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the average minimum energy requirement per person per day is about . Although the U.S. has changed over time with a growth in population and processed foods or food in general, Americans today have available roughly the same level of calories as the older generation. 

Older people and those with sedentary lifestyles require less energy; children and physically active people require more. Recognizing these factors, Australia&#x27;s National Health and Medical Research Council recommends different daily energy intakes for each age and gender group. Notwithstanding, nutrition labels on Australian food products typically recommend the average daily energy intake of .

The minimum food energy intake is also higher in cold environments. Increased mental activity has been linked with moderately increased brain energy consumption.

== Nutrition labels ==

Many governments require food manufacturers to label the energy content of their products, to help consumers control their energy intake. To facilitate evaluation by consumers, food energy values (and other nutritional properties) in package labels or tables are often quoted for convenient amounts of the food, rather than per gram or kilogram; such as in &quot;calories per serving&quot; or &quot;kcal per 100 g&quot;, or &quot;kJ per package&quot;. The units vary depending on country:

<doc id="182310" wikidata="Q465177" url="?curid=182310" title="American Institute of Certified Public Accountants">
<text>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) is the national professional organization of Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) in the United States, with more than 428,000 members in 130 countries. Founded in 1887 as the American Association of Public Accountants (AAPA), the organization sets ethical standards and U.S. auditing standards. It also develops and grades the Uniform CPA Examination. AICPA is headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, and maintains additional offices in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Ewing, New Jersey. 

==History==
AICPA and its predecessors date back to 1887, when the &quot;American Association of Public Accountants&quot; (AAPA) was formed. The Association went through several name changes over the years: the Institute of Public Accountants (1916), the American Institute of Accountants (1917), and the American Society of Public Accountants (1921), which merged into the American Institute of Accountants in 1936. At that time, the decision was made to restrict future membership to CPAs.

The number of committees grew continually over the years. In the 1940s, there were 34 committees. By 1960, there were 89. By 1970, the number had grown to 109.

In 1999, the nearly 120 existing committees underwent a re-organization with approximately half of the standing committees being replaced with a volunteer group model that placed an increased emphasis on the use of task forces. The increased use of task forces allowed for more targeted efforts with the task forces being given a specific assignment then disbanding upon completion of that assignment. Also in 1999, the first tracking and management of task forces began.&quot;

In January 2012, the AICPA entered into a joint venture with their equivalent in the UK, the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), a partnership that produced the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation. In 2014, the AICPA and the CIMA co-created the Global Management Accounting Principles (GMAPs).

The AICPA and CIMA membership bodies remain and provide all existing benefits to members.

In August 2019, the AICPA proposed a new standard to give auditors more guidance on auditing accounting estimates. This standard replaced SAS No. 122, Section 540, &quot;Auditing Accounting Estimates, Including Fair Value Accounting Estimates, and Related Disclosures.&quot; It also amended a few other sections of the AICPA Professional Standards.

==Programs==
===Uniform CPA examination===
The Uniform CPA Examination must be taken and passed by all those who wish to be licensed as a CPA. The exam is developed and scored by the Board of Examiners (BOE), a committee that consists of CPAs, state board regulators, psychometricians, and educators.

===Professional standards setting===
AICPA sets generally accepted professional and technical standards for CPAs in multiple areas. Until the 1970s, the AICPA held a virtual monopoly in this field. In the 1970s, however, it transferred its responsibility for setting generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to the newly formed Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). Following this, it retained its standards setting function in areas such as financial statement auditing, professional ethics, attest services, CPA firm quality control, CPA tax practice, business valuation, and financial planning practice. Before passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, AICPA standards in these areas were considered &quot;generally accepted&quot; for all CPA practitioners.

In the early 2000s, in response to events such as Enron&#x27;s announcement that its financial statements couldn&#x27;t be relied on and WorldCom&#x27;s bankruptcy filing, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX).

===Credentials, designations, and scholarships===
AICPA offers credentialing programs in certain subject areas for its members. The credentials are similar to state board certifications for attorneys, which also recognize subject matter-specific expertise. The AICPA offers the:

* Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
* Accredited in Business Valuation (ABV) credential
* Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) credential
* Certified in Financial Forensics (CFF) credential
* Certified Information Technology Professional (CITP) credential, which had been established in 2000.
* Certified in Entity and Intangible Valuations (CEIV) credential. 

Aong with CIMA, AICPA issues the Chartered Global Management Accountant (CGMA) designation, which was established in 2012. Based on global quality standards for ethics and performance, CGMA designees are considered experts with credibility of advanced proficiency in finance, operations, strategy and management.

The institute offers a number of scholarships for high school students, undergraduate, and graduate students, and working professionals. This includes:

* The AICPA Foundation High School Scholarship
* The AICPA Legacy Scholarships
* The Minority Doctoral Fellowship Program
* The William (Bill) Ezzell Scholarship Program

===Public interest campaigns===
AICPA also runs public interest programs, including the Feed the Pig campaign and the 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy site. Feed the Pig, a national public service campaign sponsored by the AICPA and the Ad Council, provides personal finance resources for young Americans. 360 Degrees of Financial Literacy is a national volunteer effort of the nation&#x27;s CPAs to help Americans understand their personal finances and develop money management skills.

In 2022, the AICPA and the National Association of State Boards Accountancy announced that a new Uniform CPA exam would be released in 2024 as part of the CPA Evolution initiative. The new exam is based on a “Core + Discipline” model and will include core testing in accounting, auditing, and tax, as well as three Discipline sections (candidates must select one to complete).

===WebTrust===
WebTrust is a family of e-commerce assurance and auditing programs co-developed by the AICPA with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). Accounting associations in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong also participate in the program. A specialized variant of the program exists for certificate authorities. A 2005 academic book noted that while cost of a WebTrust seal is considerably higher than that of similar products from its competitors (BBB On-Line, TrustE and VeriSign), the scope of a WebTrust certification is more comprehensive than those of its competitors, although this fact is usually lost on consumers who have trouble differentiating such seal programs, which explains the rather limited market penetration of WebTrust. A 2009 academic paper which chronicled in some depth the adoption followed by the abandonment of the WebTrust seal at a large US telecom company, noted that the management did not find the cost-benefit tradeoff worthwhile: the $100,000 per year cost for WebTrust being about twenty times higher than that of a TrustE seal.

===Government relations===
AICPA has an office in Washington, D.C. and a political action committee. On behalf of its members, the AICPA monitors and advocates on legislative and other matters that affect the accounting profession. Working with state CPA societies and other professional organizations, the AICPA provides information to and educates federal, state and local policymakers regarding key issues. Whether serving as an information resource or offering recommendations, the AICPA represents the profession while protecting the public interest.

The AICPA&#x27;s Political Action Committee is a contributor to U.S. Congressional representatives and Senators from both parties who sit on various legislative committees of relevance to CPAs.

===External roles===
The AICPA is a leading member of the International Federation of Accountants and the Global Accounting Alliance, and the Tax Professionals United for Taxpayer Relief Coalition.

The AICPA is an affiliate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of the Caribbean.

===Code of professional conduct===
Members of the AICPA must attest annually to meeting the requirements for their membership types, complying with the AICPA&#x27;s bylaws and upholding the AICPA&#x27;s Code of Profession Conduct. Members are subject to audit and, if found to be non-compliant, may be expelled from the AICPA.

===AICPA personal financial satisfaction index===
Since Q3 of 2018, AICPA has been publishing the personal financial satisfaction index on a quarterly basis that indicates the general understanding of economic factors affecting the financial standing of a typical American. As the COVID-19 pandemic has strained the U.S. economy and put millions out of work, Americans have experienced the biggest drop in their personal financial satisfaction in more than a decade. The AICPA&#x27;s Q1 2020 Personal Financial Satisfaction index (PFSi) measures 32.9, a 20 percent (8.29 point) decrease from the previous quarter. This is the largest quarterly drop the PFSi has experienced since the Great Recession (Q4 2009).

<text>The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is a private standard-setting body whose primary purpose is to establish and improve Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) within the United States in the public&#x27;s interest. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) designated the FASB as the organization responsible for setting accounting standards for public companies in the U.S. The FASB replaced the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants&#x27; (AICPA) Accounting Principles Board (APB) on July 1, 1973. The FASB is run by the nonprofit Financial Accounting Foundation.

FASB accounting standards are accepted as authoritative by many organizations, including state Boards of Accountancy and the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).

== Structure ==
The FASB is based in Norwalk, Connecticut, and is led by seven full-time Board members, one being the chairman, appointed by the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF) to serve five-year terms and are eligible for one term reappointment.

The qualifications to serve on the FASB include professional competence and realistic experience from professions like financial reporting, investment services, and financial planning. Board members also come from sectors such as academia, business, and legal, or government agencies.

FASB board members, as of February 22, 2023:

The board is supported by more than 60 staff.

In December 2019, FAF board of trustees announced that Richard Jones would succeed Russell Golden as FASB&#x27;s chair when his term expired at the end of June 2020.

=== Oversight ===
The FASB is subject to oversight by the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), which selects the members of the FASB and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board and funds both organizations. The Board of Trustees of the FAF is selected by a nomination process that involves several organizations from investing, accounting, business, financial, and governmental sectors, but are ultimately selected by the existing Board. The selection process was amended as such in 2008 to reduce private sector influence on the Board of Trustees and its oversight of the FASB and GASB.

== History ==
=== Inception ===
Marshall Armstrong, then-president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), appointed a group of seven men (collectively called the Wheat Committee after its head Francis Wheat) in 1971 to examine the organization and operation of the Accounting Principles Board, in order to determine what adjustments were needed to facilitate more accurate and timely results and avoid governmental rule-making. Their findings, &quot;Report of the Study on the Establishment of Accounting Principles&quot;, were published in March 1972, and proposed several changes including establishing the Financial Accounting Foundation, separate from other professional firms, that would be overseen by the Board of Trustees. The FASB was conceived as a full-time body to insure that Board member deliberations encourage broad participation, objectively consider all stakeholder views, and are not influenced or directed by political/private interests. The Wheat Report also recommended developing the &quot;Financial Accounting Standards Advisory Council, a 20-member advisory council that members serve an initial 1-year term, that could be renewed indefinitely, and to explicitly define the FASB research projects, to ensure timely and appropriate results.

The U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Accounting Series Release No. 150 (ASR 150), which states that FASB pronouncements will be considered by the SEC as having &quot;substantial authoritative support&quot;, in 1973. That same year, the FASB issued its first standard, &quot;Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 1: Disclosure of Foreign Currency Translation Information&quot;.

=== Conceptual Framework ===
The FASB Conceptual Framework was established in 1973 as a comprehensible set of standards and rules intended to address and solve new emerging issues. The conceptual framework underlaid financial accounting by serving as the Board&#x27;s reasoning behind its standards-setting decisions.

The conceptual framework provides two functions: to state the objectives of financial reporting and provide definitions of financial statement elements. The conceptual framework creates a foundation for financial accounting and establishes consistent standards that highlight the nature, function, and limitations of financial reporting.

=== Emerging Issues Task Force ===
The FASB formed the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) in 1984. It was formed to provide timely responses to financial issues as they emerged. The group includes 15 people from both the private and public sectors coupled with representatives from the FASB and an SEC observer. As issues emerge, the task force considers them and tries to reach a consensus on what course of action to take. From conception until the 2003 AICPA GAAP Agreement, if consensus was reached on a topic, the group would issue an EITF Issue that was considered equivalent to a FASB pronouncement and included in GAAP.

=== International standard setting comparability ===
The FASB participated in an international conference on global accounting standards in 1991, &quot;The Objectives and Concepts Underlying Financial Reporting&quot;, co-sponsored by the International Accounting Standards Committee and the Fédération des Experts Comptables Européens.

Two years later, the FASB participated in the formation of the G4+1, a group of international standard setters. Its members included the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand. In August 1994 the group released a special report, &quot;Future Events: A Conceptual Study of their Significance for Recognition and Measurement&quot;.

In 1999, the FASB issued &quot;International Accounting Standard Setting: A Vision for the Future&quot;, a report which acknowledged the rapid changes taking place in the international accounting standard setting environment, and that convergence and development of high-quality international standards are coinciding goals.

=== Norwalk Agreement ===

In 2002, the FASB began to work on a convergence project in partnership with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the independent accounting standard-setting body of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. The two groups met on September 18, 2002, in Norwalk, Connecticut, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which &quot;committed the boards to developing high-quality, compatible accounting standards with a common solution.&quot;

This MoU, which came to be known as the Norwalk Agreement, outlined plans to converge IFRS and U.S. GAAP into one set of high quality and compatible standards. For ten years the FASB and IASB collaborated on a common objective not only to eliminate differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP wherever possible, &quot;but also to achieve convergence in accounting standards that stood the test of time.&quot;

=== Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ===
The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 was signed into law on July 30, 2002, to protect stakeholders and investors by improving the dependability and precision of corporate financial disclosures. The legislation also created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and included accounting support fees from issuers of securities to FASB.

=== AICPA&#x27;s GAAP agreement ===
In November 2002, FASB Chairman Robert Herz announced that FASB and AICPA came to the agreement that the AICPA would no longer issue Statements of Positions (SOPs) that are considered authoritative GAAP. They also concluded that consensus of the EITF will be required to be ratified by the FASB to become authoritative GAAP.

=== Investor Task Force ===
The FASB established the Investor Task Force (ITF) in 2005, which was an advisory resource that provided the Board with sector expertise and specific insights from the professional investment community on relevant accounting issues. The FASB then implemented SFAS 157 which established new standards for disclosure regarding fair value measurements in financial statements in 2006. That same year, the FASB added Investor Liaisons to its staff, who would be responsible for reaching out to investors to hear feedback on the various FASB activities.

=== Financial Crisis Advisory Group (FCAG) ===
The FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board created the Financial Crisis Advisory Group in 2008—an international group of standard-setting bodies—that coordinated responses &quot;on the future of global standards in light of&quot; the financial crisis of 2007–2010. The FCAG was composed of 15–20 senior leaders in finance and chaired by Harvey Goldschmid and Hans Hoogervorst with a mandate to investigate financial reporting issues uncovered by the 2007–2008 financial crisis. FCAG members included Stephen Haddrill and Michel Prada—a member of the International Centre for Financial Regulation (ICFR) and co-chair of the Council on Global Financial Regulation was a member of the Financial Crisis Advisory Group. Haddrill who was the only UK representative on the FCAG, is CEO of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in the United Kingdom and has a close interest in accounting standards.

The FCAG issued a report in July 2009 finding, among other things, that the FASB and SEC had been pressured by politicians and banks to change accounting standards to protect banks from the impact of their toxic mortgages. Just prior to the report to the G20, and in reference to the political pressure placed on standards setters &quot;to make changes to fair value accounting rules over suggestions that it exacerbated the financial crisis&quot; Haddrill cautioned, &quot;Who do we want to set accounting standards? Not politicians, that&#x27;s clear. But neither do we want experts vacuum-packed in a world of their own.&quot;

=== Accounting Standards Codification ===

On July 1, 2009, the FASB announced the launch of its Accounting Standards Codification, an online research system representing the single source of authoritative nongovernmental U.S. GAAP, available from the FASB in multiple views; Professional view, Academic view, and Basic view. The Codification organizes the pronouncements that constitute U.S. GAAP into a consistent, searchable format. The Codification is not to be confused with the FASB&#x27;s 1973 Conceptual Framework project.

=== Convergence to international comparability ===
In 2010, the SEC instructed the staff to create and implement a work plan that addresses whether, when and how U.S. GAAP should be merged into a global reporting model developed by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)—the standards setting body designated by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The SEC staff research included including convergence with IFRS and an alternate IFRS endorsement mechanism.

In the resulting 2012 report, the SEC Staff asserted that the IFRS standards were not sufficiently supported by U.S. capital market participants and lacked consistent implementation methods. The report goes on to say that, while the U.S. financial reporting community does not support IFRS as the authoritative mechanism for US financial reporting, there is support for &quot;high-quality, globally accepted accounting standards&quot; as demonstrated in the joint efforts of the IASB and FASB to develop converged financial reporting for revenue recognition and lease accounting.

The FASB and the IASB issued guidance on recognizing revenue in contracts with customers in 2014, establishing principles to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue from these transactions. In May 2015 the SEC acknowledged that &quot;investors, auditors, regulators and standard-setters&quot; in the United States did not support mandating International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS) for all U.S. public companies. There was &quot;little support for the SEC to provide an option allowing U.S. companies to prepare their financial statements under IFRS.&quot; However, there was support for a single set of globally accepted accounting standards. The FASB and IASB planned meetings in 2015 to discuss &quot;business combinations, the disclosure framework, insurance contracts and the conceptual framework.&quot; As of 2017, there were no active bilateral FASB/IASB projects underway. Instead, the FASB participates in the Accounting Standards Advisory Forum, a global grouping of standard-setters, and monitors individual projects to seek comparability.

== Accounting standards ==
=== Credit losses ===
On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that improves financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The ASU also amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, and requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization&#x27;s portfolio.

=== Variable interest entities ===
Under the new standard, the decision whether to consolidate is determined by two factors: a company&#x27;s design and intention and a parent company&#x27;s ability to direct that organization&#x27;s actions in a way that significantly impacts its economic performance.

=== Pensions ===
In late 2006, the FASB issued &quot;Employers&#x27; Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans&quot; (statement 158). Under this update, if a pension or other post-retirement plan is overfunded, a company must recognize that overfunded amount as an asset, which can be reduced later if the plan becomes underfunded. Conversely, if a plan is underfunded, a company must recognize that underfunded amount as a liability, which can be reduced if a plan&#x27;s funding increases in a period. These asset or liability determinations are recognized at the employer&#x27;s year end in the same year that the plan funding takes place.

These enhancements were made in order to provide employees, investors, retirees, and users of financial statements more complete information about the status of a pension or other post-retirement plan, which is used to make informed decisions about organizations capabilities to fulfill plan obligations.

=== Stock options ===
The FASB issued a statement on &quot;Share Based Payments&quot; (statement 123(R)) in 2004, developed jointly with the IASB. This standard update requires companies to identify the cost of share-based payments (e.g., restricted share plans, employee share purchase plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights, and stock options) within their financials. The FASB updated this reporting standard with the goal of improving comparability, relevance and reliability of financial information.

=== Leases (balance sheet) ===
In February 2016, the FASB issued a new Leases standard, to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The new standard requires organizations to include lease obligations on their balance sheets, and affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets.

=== Derivative accounting ===
Upon electing to use hedge accounting, companies must establish a method to evaluate the effectiveness of hedging a derivative, and a method to determine the ineffectiveness of a hedge. The FASB further improved derivative accounting in 2017 with simplification measures included in ASU 2017–12.

== Criticism ==
=== Mark-to-market ===
Critics argue that the 2006 SFAS 157 contributed to the 2008 financial crisis by easing the mark-to-market accounting rule and allowing valuation of assets based on their current market price, rather than the purchase price. Critics claim FASB changes to mark-to-market accounting were made to accommodate &quot;banks with toxic assets on their books.&quot;
However, others from within the accounting profession assert that the mark-to-market system in fact provides greater transparency and stability by applying similar values to similar assets, regardless of whether they were bought or created internally by a firm. They contrast this with the alternate &quot;mark-to-model&quot; system—said to be riskier, less transparent, and results in incomparable and inconsistent reporting.

Others say mark-to-market provides the most practical choice when valuing most assets, if there is understanding of the long-term effects, and obligation to a global position. They counter that the banking issues went beyond failures in accounting and into major liquidity concerns, and that the accounting profession, FASB, and SEC were not responsible for the banking crisis.

A report from the Harvard Business Review agreed that the mark-to-market accounting is not the direct cause of the financial crisis, but the lack of knowledge related to accounting standards by investors fueled the fire. Most investors at the time assumed that all of banks&#x27; assets were appraised at market prices, and that the writing down of bonds would cause banks to violate regulatory capital requirements.

=== Materiality ===
The FASB issued a proposal regarding &quot;the use of materiality by reporting entities&quot; in an amendment of the definition of the legal concept of materiality in 2015, stating that &quot;information would be considered material if it was likely to be seen by a reasonable person as significantly altering the total mix of facts about a company.&quot; This amendment raised concerns by auditors who believed leaving materiality as a legal concept would undermine judgments made by preparers and auditors to an attorney.

=== International comparability vs. convergence ===
Some industry professionals support development of a single, globally-shared set of accounting standards. Convergence proponents assert that a single set of standards would make it easier and more cost-effective for large multi-national corporations to report using one set of financial reporting standards for all countries. They believe it would make financial statements more comparable to one another, improving overall transparency and understanding of a company&#x27;s financial health. Supporters also argue that a single set of standards would give investors access to crucial information more quickly and increase opportunities for international investments, resulting in economic growth.

Other professionals, however, are opposed to wholesale convergence of a single set of international accounting standards. Opponents share concerns that, due to different environmental influences around the world, such as differing stages of economic development and sources of funding, independent accounting standards are appropriate and necessary.

Convergence opponents have said that without vision and commitment to convergence, the standards wouldn&#x27;t be effective unless they were enforced or provide significant benefits.

Many U.S. accounting firms are opposed to convergence because of the familiarity of GAAP, the unfamiliarity with international accounting principles, and other countries&#x27; accounting systems. U.S. firms and other CPAs have been reluctant to adapt and learn a new accounting system, and believe that IFRS lacks guidance compared to the GAAP. CFOs are also against converging to one set of standards, because of the associated cost.

<text>The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the source of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) used by state and local governments in the United States. As with most of the entities involved in creating GAAP in the United States, it is a private, non-governmental organization.

The GASB is subject to oversight by the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), which selects the members of the GASB and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and it funds both organizations.

Its mission is to establish and improve standards of state and local governmental accounting and financial reporting that will result in useful information for users of financial reports and guide and educate the public, including issuers, auditors, and users of those financial reports.

The GASB has issued &quot;Statements&quot;, &quot;Interpretations&quot;, &quot;Technical Bulletins&quot;, &quot;Concept Statements&quot; and &quot;Implementation Guides&quot; defining GAAP for state and local governments since 1984. GAAP for the Federal government is defined by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board.

In January 2020, GASB appointed Joel Black to succeed David Vaudt as the chair. Black is also partner-in-charge of Mauldin &amp; Jenkins LLC.

<doc id="182313" wikidata="Q1258876" url="?curid=182313" title="International Accounting Standards Committee">
<text>The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was founded in June 1973 in London at the initiative of Sir Henry Benson, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. The IASC was created by national accountancy bodies from a number of countries with a view to harmonizing the international diversity of company reporting practices. Between its founding in 1973 and its dissolution in 2001, it developed a set of International Accounting Standards (IAS) that gradually acquired a degree of acceptance in countries around the world. Although the IASC came to include some organizations representing preparers and users of financial statements, it largely remained an initiative of the accountancy profession. On 1 April 2001, it was replaced by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), an independent standard-setting body. The IASB adopted the extant corpus of IAS which it continued to develop as International Financial Reporting Standards.

== Membership ==
The IASC was founded as a result of an agreement between accountancy bodies in the following countries:

*Australia (Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA) and the CPA Australia (formerly known as Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA))
*Canada (Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA))
*France (Ordre des Experts Comptables et des Comptables Agréés (Order of Accounting Experts and Qualified Accountants))
*Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland (IDW) (Institute of Auditors in Germany) and the Wirtschaftsprüferkammer (WPK) (Chamber of Auditors))
*Japan Nihon Kouninkaikeishi Kyoukai (Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants, JICPA))
*Mexico (Instituto Mexicano de Contadores Públicos (IMCP) (Mexican Institute of Public Accountants)) (removed from the board in 1987 due to non-payment of dues; resumed in 1995).
*the Netherlands (Nederlands Instituut van Registeraccountants (NIVRA) (Netherlands Institute of Registered Auditors))
*the United Kingdom and Ireland (counted as one) (Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS), Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (ICAI), Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA), and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA)
*the United States of America (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA))
Membership of the committee (later known as the board) was on an institutional, not at an individual basis. Each institution represented on the board could send a delegation of two representatives and a staff observer to committee meetings. Each delegation wielded one vote. According to the IASC&#x27;s original Constitution, membership was limited to the founding member bodies. Other accountancy bodies could join as associate members. This allowed them to propose members for working parties and so to contribute to the setting of the standards, but did not give them representation or a vote at board meetings. In 1977, the IASC&#x27;s Constitution was changed to allow for the appointment of two additional board members for four-year terms, on a rotating basis. In a further change to the Constitution in 1982, the terms of all board members were limited to five years. The distinction between founding and associate members was abolished, as all member bodies of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) became members of the IASC. Board members were since then appointed by the IFAC Council. Because of an agreement reached in 1981 between IFAC and the IASC, the founding member bodies continued to be reappointed (with the exception of Mexico in 1987) and de facto retained their permanent seats. Under these arrangements, the following changes in board membership took place:

* The National Council of Chartered Accountants (South Africa, subsequently known as the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, SAICA) became an associate member in 1974 and joined the board in 1978. Because of continued reappointments, South Africa became in effect a permanent member of the board. In 1995 the South Africans began sharing their representation on the board with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe.
* The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria became an associate member in 1976 and was a member of the board from 1979 to 1987.
* The Consiglio Nazionale dei Dottori Commercialisti (Italy) joined the IASC board in 1983 and remained until 1995.
* The National Federation of Certified Public Accountants Associations of the Republic of China became a member of IFAC Council in 1983 and in 1984 began a three-year term as the second accountancy body from East Asia, after Japan, represented on the IASC Board.
* Denmark became a member in 1988, replaced in 1990 by the Nordic Federation of Public Accountants (represented by Danes, Swedes and Norwegians, since the Fins and Icelandics were not interested in participating).
* Korea sent a delegation from 1988 to 1992.
* A Jordanian delegation served on the Board from 1989 to 1995 which was constituted by the Arab Society of Certified Accountants.
* The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) became an associate member in 1974 and joined the board in 1993. In 1995, India began sharing the delegation with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka.
* The Malaysian Association of Certified Public Accountants became an associate member in 1975 (later joined by the Institut Akauntan Malaysia, the Malaysian Institute of Accountants), and was a member of the board from 1995 to 2000.

Between 1973 and the change in the IASC&#x27;s Constitution which made all IFAC members IASC members, a total of 46 accountancy bodies were admitted as associate members, including: the New Zealand Society of Accountants (1974); the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan and the Pakistan Institute of Industrial Accountants (1974); the Singapore Society of Accountants (1975); the Hong Kong Society of Accountants (1975).

The IASC&#x27;s constitution as revised in 1982 provided for a limited expansion of the board&#x27;s membership beyond the organized accountancy profession. Up to four organizations having an interest in financial reporting could now be invited to be represented on the board. As a result, three non-auditor delegations were added over time, all remaining on the board until the end of the IASC:

* 1986: The International Co-ordinating Committee of Financial Analysts Associations (since 1988 known as the International Council of Investment Associations).
* 1995: The Federation of Swiss Industrial Holding Companies.
* 1996: The International Association of Financial Executives Institutes.

== Organization ==
At the core of the IASC was the committee, or board, consisting of delegations from the member bodies. The board typically met three to four times a year for two or three days in locations around the world. It was served by a permanent secretariat based in London. The technical agenda of the board was prepared by working groups known as steering committees, each appointed to develop proposals for a new or modified standard on a specific topic. Steering committee membership was on an individual, not institutional, basis, but appointment was based on recommendation by an IASC member body, industry organization or similar grouping.

From the start, the IASC adopted the practice of issuing draft standards (exposure drafts) for public comment before agreeing on a final standard. This allowed a degree of wider participation in the standard-setting work even though in practice a large proportion of the responses came from accountancy bodies, audit firms and national accounting standard setters. In 1981, the IASC established a Consultative Group, with a view to engaging a broader set of organizations in its work.

In 1996, the IASC set up a Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC), charged with issuing interpretations of standards on relatively narrow issues arising in practice.

Leadership of the IASC was provided by the chairman of the board and head of the secretariat (the Secretary, known since 1984 as Secretary-General):

=== Chairmen of the IASC ===

== Standards ==
Starting with IAS 1 &quot;Disclosure of Accounting Policies,&quot; published in 1975, the IASC issued 41 International Accounting Standards, each dealing with a specific financial reporting topic. Over time, standards were amended or replaced. When the IASC was replaced by the IASB, 34 standards were still extant and adopted by the IASB.

The original aim of the IASC was to issue &#x27;basic&#x27; standards. In practice, this meant that the standards often reflected common, rather than best practices in the board member countries. Several standards contained alternative treatments (options), reflecting the diversity of practice. For instance, IAS 2 &quot;Valuation and Presentation of Inventories in the Context of the Historical Cost System&quot; (1975) allowed a variety of practices including the LIFO, FIFO and base stock methods. For this reason, the IASC was sometimes criticized for taking a &#x27;lowest common denominator&#x27; approach. However, some of the early standards prescribed practices that were not yet commonly followed in many countries, including several board member countries. IAS 3 &quot;Consolidated Financial Statements and the Equity Method of Accounting&quot; (1976) required the presentation of consolidated financial statements by parents of subsidiary companies. This was well before the Seventh Company Law Directive (1983) made this mandatory in the member states of the European Economic Community. IAS 17 &quot;Accounting for Leases&quot; (1982) required the capitalization of finance leases, a practice that was as yet unusual or unknown outside the United States.

In 1987, the IASC adopted a new strategy of strengthening its standards to make them a suitable basis for financial reporting by companies seeking cross-border stock market listings. In doing so, it was encouraged by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) which in 1988 signaled its willingness to consider an improved set of IAS as the basis for preparing financial information in multinational prospectuses. As US capital markets were among the most important in the world, this meant above all that the IASC had to bring its standards more in line with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) in order to gain acceptance by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a key IOSCO member. In 1987, the IASC embarked on a project to revise its extant standards. The revisions included the elimination of options, the expansion of disclosure requirements and additional guidance for the application of the standards. The revisions were completed in 1992. As this did not yet satisfy IOSCO, the IASC embarked on a new work programme to revise its standards, and to add standards on topics that were not yet, or only partially covered, such as accounting for financial instruments. This &#x27;core standards&#x27; programme was completed under strong time pressure in 1998 with the publication of IAS 39 &quot;Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.&quot;

== Impact ==
According to the IASC&#x27;s Constitution, the member bodies were committed to use their &#x27;best endeavours&#x27; with reporting companies, their auditors, governments and securities market regulators to ensure that published financial statements complied with IAS, and that audit reports referred to any non-compliance. In the absence of large-scale global surveys of corporate reporting practices for the 1970s and 1980s, it is not possible to assess with any degree of precision to what degree reporting companies adopted IAS. In the early 1980s, a number of Canadian listed companies began to assert compliance with IAS in their financial statements, but this seems to have been the case in few other countries. One explanation of this limited direct impact is that in most countries, national accountancy bodies had no authority to force companies to adopt IAS. This does not rule out an indirect influence of IAS, as national accounting standards in a range of countries incorporated elements of the national standards in national requirements.

The efforts of the IASC, from 1987 onwards, to improve its standards in order to make them an acceptable basis for cross-border listings led to greater recognition. During the 1990s, a number of major European companies began to prepare financial statements on the basis of US GAAP because of actual or planned listings in the United States. Others adopted IAS which was increasingly seen as a set of standards of sufficient quality for international capital markets. In 1998, German companies were allowed to satisfy their legal reporting requirements in Germany by publishing consolidated financial statements based on &#x27;internationally recognized principles of accounting&#x27;, which in practice meant either US GAAP or IAS.

<text>The Victoria Bridge is a bus and pedestrian bridge over the Brisbane River. The current bridge, opened in 1969, is the third permanent crossing erected at this location. Since 24 January 2021, the bridge has been closed to general traffic, and now carries buses, pedestrians and cyclists only.

The Victoria Bridge, the Brisbane River&#x27;s first road crossing has had a long and interesting history. Since 1865 there have been several versions of the bridge built to connect South Brisbane (near the South Bank Parklands and Queensland Cultural Centre) to the Brisbane central business district (CBD) at North Quay. Half of the road space on the bridge is now given over to the South East Busway. In the 2006 Brisbane City Centre Draft Masterplan, a new crossing immediately adjacent to the Victoria Bridge, tentatively named the Adelaide Street Bridge was recommended for a feasibility study.

==1864 Brisbane Bridge==
Construction of a bridge across the Brisbane River was first agreed to in 1861. The newly formed Legislative Assembly of Queensland forced the council to pay for the costs, to be financed by unsold crown land in South Brisbane which was transferred to the Corporation of Brisbane under the terms of the Brisbane Bridge Act of 1861. £70,000 worth of borrowings was acquired from the Bank of Queensland secured by mortgage of the bridge lands. Work began on the foundations for the first bridge across the Brisbane River, then known as the Brisbane Bridge, on 22 August 1864. The contractor, John Bourne, offered to convert the scaffolding he was constructing into a temporary bridge. In return for this and an annual payment to the council, he was allowed to charge a toll. This timber structure opened in June 1865. The Bank of Queensland suspended payments in July 1866 and the shareholders decided to wind the bank up, bringing about a halt to funding for the project. The Queensland Government was reluctant to take on responsibility for the bridge&#x27;s construction because it didn&#x27;t want to incur debt. The timber bridge quickly succumbed to marine wood worm Teredo Navalis and began to progressively collapse. The council wasn&#x27;t able to fully repair the structure and its remnants took two years to fall away into the river, along with some components of the partly built iron bridge. After the bridge collapsed on 16 November 1867, the public had to resort back to using ferries to cross the river.

Following resolution of the issue of the debt owed to the liquidators of the Bank Of Queensland in 1871, an English company, Peto, Brassey and Co, agreed to complete the bridge. The new crossing was opened on 15 June 1874 by the Governor of Queensland, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby who gave it the name &quot;Victoria Bridge&quot;, and was an iron structure and a toll bridge. The bridge was paid for by significant council borrowings that were to be recouped by tolls. However a lack of revenue and widespread community objections to the tolls forced its transfer to the Colonial Government. The tolls were abolished at this time. The bridge included a turning span to allow tall-masted river traffic to pass upstream. A condition of the original Bridge Act was that the bridge &quot;would not obstruct the navigation of the river Brisbane by sea-going vessels&quot;. Over time, the swing was little used and subsequently water and gas pipes were laid across it. After the Council lost a court action in 1885 brought by a ship owner when it refused to operate the swing, the Government swiftly passed legislation fixing the bridge. The next year, tram-lines were laid along the bridge. It carried a and a diameter pipe which supplied mains water to South Brisbane. This bridge was partially washed away in the 1893 Brisbane flood. In the meantime, ferries were used to transport people and goods across the busy river. This, however, led to the capsize of the ferry ‘’Pearl’’ disaster in 1896 with the loss of more than 40 lives. A temporary wooden structure was built covering the collapsed section of the old bridge while the new bridge was being built.

== 1897 Victoria Bridge ==

Another replacement bridge was built and entered service in 1897, lasting until 1969, when it was demolished. This second bridge was designed by Alfred Barton Brady. It was constructed of steel and wrought iron (superstructure), cast iron (structure) and stone (abutments and wing walls - purple hard stone/porphyry, brown freestone and Portland cement) and had two carriage ways and two footpaths. As early as 1943 evidence of the bridge buckling from the weight of increased traffic was noticed. Tram numbers on the bridge had to be restricted and cars limited to the outer lanes as a result.

A portion of the southern abutment of the previous bridge remains adjacent to the current bridge, including a pedestrian arch, a short remnant of tram track and a memorial to Hector Vasyli, a young boy who was killed in a traffic accident at that point when waving to servicemen returning from the First World War. The abutment is heritage-listed.
== Current bridge ==

Planning commenced on a new bridge in 1953, however in 1957 an inspection revealed that there had been no deterioration since 1949, and with careful maintenance, its life would be indefinite. A new bridge, which was opened on 14 April 1969, was needed to meet growing traffic demands. It cost A$3.2 million and featured a modern design which has been described as sleek and elegant. For a short period both bridges were open, each operating in one direction only.

<text>The William Jolly Bridge is a heritage-listed road bridge over the Brisbane River between North Quay in the Brisbane central business district and Grey Street in South Brisbane, within City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Harding Frew and built from 1928 to 1932 by MR Hornibrook.

The style of the bridge&#x27;s design is Art Deco, which was popular at the time. MR Hornibrook company built the bridge that consists of two piers that were built in the river and two pylons on the river banks, which support three graceful arches. The rainbow arch type, as it was described, was claimed to be the first of its type in Australia. It is a steel frame arch bridge with an unusual concrete veneer, treated to make it appear like &quot;light-coloured porphyry&quot;.

When opened, during the worst year of the Great Depression, the bridge was known simply as the Grey Street Bridge. It was renamed to the William Jolly Bridge on 5 July 1955 in memory of William Jolly, the first Lord Mayor of Greater Brisbane. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 August 1996.

== History ==
The William Jolly Bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of Greater Brisbane in 1925, and was one of the first major capital works of the new Brisbane City Council and bears the name of its first Mayor, William Jolly. At the time of construction, the only traffic bridge linking the Brisbane central business district and South Brisbane was the second Victoria Bridge, built in 1897 to replace an earlier bridge washed away in the flood of 1893. The William Jolly Bridge crosses the Brisbane River at the tip of the South Brisbane peninsula between Grey Street, South Brisbane, and at North Quay at the intersection of Skew and Saul Streets on the northern bank.

The tip of the South Brisbane peninsula is traditionally a point of crossing. A sandy beach marked the point of crossing for aboriginal tribes from the Moreton region, then later for Europeans who crossed the river near this point on the North Quay ferry, and then from the 1930s via the William Jolly Bridge. On the south bank, aboriginal and later European pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks.

Prior to European settlement, the whole of the South Brisbane peninsula was known as Kurilpa, meaning the place of rats, due to the large number of bush rats to be found in the lush vegetation of the area. (The riverfront park adjacent to the bridge at South Brisbane is now called Kurilpa Point.). The first European use of the south bank occurred soon after the establishment of the Moreton Bay penal settlement in 1825 when convicts cleared the flats across the river in order to grow grain to feed the settlement. In 1830 the cultivation of the flats on the south bank was ordered to cease by the Commandant; however throughout the 1830s timber was being exported to Sydney from the south bank. Those en route to the outstations at Coopers Plains, Limestone Hill and Cleveland crossed the area.

On 10 February 1842, following the closure of the penal settlement, the Moreton Bay district was declared open for free settlement. As the point of entry and exit, South Brisbane prospered in the 1840s. In 1846 Brisbane was brought within the provisions of the Police Towns Act of 1839, and boundaries to the town were set.

The first ferry to convey passengers, horses and carriages began operation from Russell Street . For over 30 years this was the only vehicular ferry crossing to North Brisbane (as the Brisbane CBD was then known) in this area, except for a brief period from June 1865-November 1867 when a temporary timber bridge, which was rapidly destroyed by marine borer, spanned the river.

Brisbane&#x27;s first burial ground had been established on the northern bank where Skew Street is now located, (later moved to Hale Street where it became known as Paddington Cemetery, site now partially occupied by Suncorp Stadium), and to the rear of the burial ground a new gaol was established by 1860 and military barracks in 1864. Farming was established along the banks of the river, and development concentrated on Petrie Terrace. Land between the new burial ground and barracks was put up for auction in 1861, and from 1863 the auctioning of suburban allotments (now Paddington) encouraged the spread of the settlement along the ridges.

The North Quay Ferry, a row boat, crossed the river where the bridge now stands, and the River Road (now Coronation Drive) was established as a track which serviced properties towards Toowong. The extension on the Main Line railway from Ipswich to Brisbane in 1875 isolated the strip of riverfront residences from the working-class houses in Milton and Paddington, and this contributed to the relative lack of development along the northern bank of the Milton Reach of the river in subsequent years.

The opening of the Victoria Bridge on 15 June 1874 provided an important transport and communications link between the north and south banks of the river, and provided further impetus to the development of the south bank. The Victoria Bridge was funded by the Brisbane Municipal Council and a toll was imposed to recover costs. Eventually, responsibility for the bridge was taken over by the Queensland Government.

In the 1880s, the south bank experienced a development boom. The South Brisbane dry dock was opened in 1881, coal wharves at Woolloongabba and associated rail links were established c.1885, and South Brisbane railway station was established as the passenger terminus for suburban and country lines built during the 1880s. Industry and commerce was attracted to the area, and Stanley Street developed into a major retail centre and thoroughfare. The spread of housing included the development of large residences located along the ridges with views of the river, and industry developed along the southern bank of the Milton Reach.

The establishment of the South Brisbane municipality occurred on 7 January 1888. The development of the civic centre focused on the Stanley and Vulture Street intersection, with the construction of the South Brisbane Town Hall, Fire Station, Post Office and South Brisbane railway station. The boom of the 1880s collapsed, followed by maritime and pastoral strikes in the early 1890s, and the collapse of banks in 1893. Land and rent values plummeted to their lowest levels and hundreds of home owners applied to the council to work out their rates. A series of floods of the Brisbane River in 1893 resulted in the collapse of the Albert rail bridge at Indooroopilly in 1893, which diverted all rail traffic to South Brisbane, and the collapse of Victoria Bridge on 6 February 1893 which cut vital transport and communications links with the central city. A report in the &quot;Telegraph&quot; on 8 February 1893 described the event as:&quot;What a terrible hiatus in the course of business alone has been caused by the collapse of Victoria Bridge. Once again, for practical purposes, the metropolis is divided into two separate towns. No bridge, no telephone, no telegraph, and vastly inadequate ferry accommodation.&quot;Urban expansion on both sides of the river continued with the opening of the new Victoria Bridge in 1897 and the advent of electric trams. The first encroachment of industry into the residential enclave along the high northern embankment occurred above the North Quay ferry terminal in 1897 with the construction of the Helidon Spa Company&#x27;s extensive works from the North Quay–River Road intersection. The residential enclave was further reduced when the Morrow-Rankin (later Arnott&#x27;s Biscuits) factory was established upstream from the Helidon Spa works in 1913.

On 3 October 1903, the Queensland Government gazetted the proclamation which constituted the City of South Brisbane. From 1908 the South Brisbane City Council tried to bring all the wharves in the South Brisbane Reach under its control and encouraged further commercial and industrial development along the river front. As finance permitted, provision of services such as gas, electricity, road sealing, water supply and an adequate system of drainage and sanitation improved the living and working conditions in the area and generated a demand for residential accommodation and improved cross-river communication.

In the immediate period after World War I, residential growth created continued demand for public transport, particularly through and from the South Brisbane peninsula. Land resumption for road widening was enacted in both Stanley and Melbourne Streets, and in September 1925, South Brisbane City Council is noted as having a population of 40,000 persons. In 1930 the completion of the Sydney to South Brisbane interstate railway benefited the local economy with a demand for factory and manufacturing sites. Health factors, noise and nuisance associated with industry and proximity to wharves and docks all contributed to the changing perception of the area bounded by Grey and Boundary Streets, Montague Road and the river. As a result, when the time came to resume land in connection with the construction of the Grey Street Bridge, there was scant opposition.

The Grey Street Bridge was conceived as a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of Brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the Victoria Bridge and on CBD streets such as George Street.

By the time Greater Brisbane was formed in 1925, the need for further cross river links had been established. Traffic across the Victoria Bridge had increased 76% from 1912 to 1925, and in 1923 it was noted that traffic tonnage had increased 49.5% in 15 months. The Victoria Bridge also contributed to traffic congestion in the Brisbane CBD as all traffic between the suburbs on the north and south sides of the river had to pass through the CBD. The 1897 Victoria Bridge had a paved deck with bituminous surfacing on wrought iron troughing. Between 1920 and 1922 this paving was replaced by concrete, causing traffic congestion. In 1922, the need for additional traffic on Victoria Bridge was identified, and the Mayor of Brisbane noted the need for cross river traffic as pressing and urgent. The Victoria Bridge structure was investigated in 1923 to determine its strength for further loading, and Walter James Doak, Bridge Engineer of the Queensland Railways, noted that the bridge is now loaded to rather more than its orthodox capacity under live load, but it was considered that there was no immediate danger of collapse. His recommendations included various repairs, and that a second bridge should be built.

The first meeting of the Greater Brisbane Council in March 1925 passed a motion concerning the employment of experts to investigate what cross river facilities were required and their best locations. Mayor William Alfred Jolly was Chairman of the Bridges and Ferries Committee, and recommended that three experts be employed. A motion was passed on 20 May 1925 to appoint a Cross River Commission, which reported on 11 January 1926 (chairman Roger Hawken, Professor of Engineering at the University of Queensland, William Muir Nelson and Ronald Martin Wilson). The report showed 11 proposed river crossings, and considered costs and savings made due to the reduction in haulage costs etc., and the need for a railway bridge was also discussed. A bridge at Grey Street would be a bypass for motor traffic between the southern suburbs and western suburbs of Brisbane to avoid increasing traffic congestion on the Victoria Bridge and on CBD streets such as George Street. A crossing at Kangaroo Point (where the Story Bridge was later built) was estimated to cost 6 times the Grey Street crossing, and further reports were commissioned from William John Earle, the City Planner, and Eneas Fraser Gilchrist, the City Engineer. These reports proposed the Grey Street bridge be two level for road and rail traffic, and a second bridge from Wellington Road to Sydney Street, New Farm, with a major ring road called the Main Parkway Boulevard, be constructed.

On 7 June 1926 Council decided to build a bridge from Grey Street, South Brisbane. However, Gilchrist Avenue (named after EF Gilchrist City Engineer), which is on the other side of the rail line to the proposed Main Parkway Boulevard, is in essence part of the proposed traffic system for the Grey Street Bridge as per Earle&#x27;s recommended ring road system. The existing Gilchrist Avenue&#x27;s original drawings are dated 25 June 1930.

The Council called applications for a bridge engineer to design a steel or reinforced concrete bridge on 10 July 1926. Harding Frew, a local but prominent civil engineer, was appointed Engineer for the bridge on 12 November 1926.

Problems were encountered with the design of the bridge due to the depth of rock below the river bed increasing from approximately on the southern bank. Due to the costly foundation work, a bridge type with long spans was chosen. Harding Frew considered five bridge types, each a variation on a theme, stating in his report that:&quot;it is frankly admitted that the purely economical aspect alone has not been given as much weight... as the consideration of utility, with good taste, combined with minimum maintenance cost. ... The maintenance requirements for, and performance of, steel bridges was also noted as a concern.&quot;Harding Frew recommended bridge type A and the Council adopted his recommendation, of which some of the details of approaches etc. changed from design to construction. The chosen bridge design was to be of concrete-encased steel with arched ribs which rise through the deck. The final decision of the type of bridge, from the five under consideration, was essentially aesthetic, and was influenced by the so-called Rainbow Arch Bridge, carrying Robert Street, St Paul, Minnesota across the Mississippi River. Harding Frew acknowledged this in his report, including photographs of the bridge, and stated that:&quot;the time has come when some improvement in the appearance of our city bridges should be looked for in Queensland. ...The questions of utility and aesthetics should also be weighed carefully, especially in relation to a city&#x27;s importance, its civic pride, and its future.&quot;The selected bridge design differed from the St Paul bridge in that it has three major spans whereas the St Paul bridge only has one, and this has been suggested as possibly making the William Jolly Bridge unique.

The council resumed large areas of land bounded by Roma, Saul and Skew Streets, and between Skew Street, Eagle Terrace and North Quay on the northern side, and on the southern side, east of Grey Street between Montague Road and Melbourne Street. The final position of the bridge was determined by Harding Frew&#x27;s recommendations (Earle and Gilchrist&#x27;s were slightly upstream from the present site) and was accepted by Council in late 1926. The bridge was to have a North Quay underpass, and the estimated total cost was £700,000 including viaducts, compulsory acquisitions, roadways, approaches and contingencies. This caused dismay, and the Commissioner for Main Roads considered that the cost should be contained to £500,000 by reducing the North Quay roadworks, minimising resumptions and building a different type of bridge.

Nevertheless, Council called tenders and MR Hornibrook Ltd submitted the lowest of £384,850 and this was accepted on 8 May 1928. Work commenced in August 1928 and was completed in March 1932.

An artist&#x27;s impression at the time of construction shows trams crossing the bridge with overhead cables, a monument of some kind at the intersection of Skew and Saul Streets, and a different number of viaducts on southern side to those actually built.

An incident occurred on 17 February 1927 which highlighted the potentially disastrous situation of having only one bridge across the Brisbane River. The cargo steamer &quot;Chronos&quot; was taken upstream by a rising tide and the bow was wedged under the Victoria Bridge. Tugs managed to pull it out eventually, but the rising tide could have dislodged a span of the bridge and dumped it in the river, and this was highlighted in the press at the time.

As mentioned, the depth-to-rock over much of the length of the William Jolly Bridge posed a major problem in the design of the foundations. The original design had the piers supported on timber piles, with inclined piles to resist the thrust from the small arch. Piles were driven immediately to the south of the pier, but it became impossible to drive them into the rock and the design was changed to utilise reinforced concrete caissons (heavy, hollow, vertical reinforced concrete cylinders), and the contractor was noted as being completely in accord with this decision. The southern approach spans piers founded on timber piles all driven to rock, or to such depths as it was possible to drive them without damage, and the river piers are founded on reinforced concrete caissons. To achieve this the Sand Island method was invented by Manuel Hornibrook (1893-1970).

The Sand Island is an artificial island constructed by placing sand within a closed ring of sheet piles driven into the bed of the river. Two islands were constructed for each pier (one for each of the cylindrical caissons) with the caissons being in diameter at the base. The pier on the sloping mud bank also used this method with rectangular caissons. Hornibrook is quoted as stating:&quot;...as far as I am concerned the idea is an original one...The idea came to me one morning about 3 o&#x27;clock. I was so much taken up with it that I got out of bed and commenced to design a scheme to carry out the piers for the Grey Street Bridge.&quot;The use of Sand Islands was highly successful and very accurate, and overcame the problem of requiring the cutting edge to be placed directly on dry ground. The material was dredged out of the centre of the caisson and the cylinder progressively sank; however it was necessary to ensure that the caisson was fixed securely to rock and it was therefore essential to ensure man-access into the cylinder. This was achieved by using an air-lock system, but as the men worked under high pressure they could possibly suffer from the bends and an hospital air-lock was located at the surface for repressurisation if required. The foundations for the bridge were very deep, and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge, and later the Story Bridge, was considered of great value and to be a major achievement.

The steelwork was fabricated at the Evans Deakin &amp; Company plant at Rocklea, and the arches had just been fixed in place when, on 5 February 1931 a major flood swept timber falsework away but fortunately the steelwork remained in place.

The steelwork was encased in gunite, a sprayed dry mix concrete, the process of which was based on an invention in the United States at turn of century to spray plaster of paris in the reconstruction of skeletons of prehistoric animals. Between 1904 and 1909 this method was modified to spray sand and cement using a machine known as a Cement- Gun. Gunite was copyrighted in 1912 and continued as a proprietary trademark until 1967, when it became a generic term. The process involves a mixture of sand and cement which is loaded into one chamber, a stream of the dry mixture is forced along a delivery pipe to the gun, and on discharge is mixed with an annular jet of water. It was only in the 1920s that the process spread internationally, and it is difficult to ascertain whether other examples of bridges using the Gunite process, beside the St Paul Minnesota bridge, exist. It would appear that the use of Gunite in the arches, beams, deck members and hangers of the main spans, is a major early use of the process in Australia. The Opening Booklet for the bridge states:&quot;The encasing of broad flange beams with concrete applied under pressure introduces new methods to Brisbane.&quot;The southern approach of the bridge, to the south of Montague Road, was designed to have wider footpaths and roadway than the remainder of the bridge to conform with the decision of the council to utilise this portion of the approach, so that access might be had to abutting buildings (directly) from the bridge roadway.

The concrete balustrades were made by the Hume Pipe Company, and were centrifugally cast in their factory at West End. The Hume brothers invented the centrifugal casting method, for the casting of concrete pipes etc., and their firm was established in Adelaide in 1910. The mould for the grotesques, which decorate the bridge, was made by Karma Eklund, daughter of the State Manager, Hugo Eklund.

The structural steelwork including angles, plates, channels etc. was almost wholly imported from Great Britain. Broad flange beams were supplied from Belgium, the largest being 30 x which were larger than Australian rolled beams at the time. The use of large sections in the southern approaches allowed longer spans thereby reducing the number of piers. The cement and aggregate was supplied by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company.

Provision for a major water pipe never eventuated, and the closer spacing of stringers in the centre to support a tramway was not utilised. The decorative towers were intended to support overhead cables for the proposed tramway. The bridge originally crossed the North Quay underpass on two continuous, reinforced-concrete girder spans, each with girders of variable depth. These have since been replaced by precast, prestressed concrete deck units above Coronation Drive, which links onto the Riverside Expressway, and in the process the footpath widths have been reduced.

The extent of work included in the bridge contract excluded some retaining walls, roadways etc. on the northern side which were designed by the council. A statement was presented to the council on 14 November 1933 showing the official final cost as £688,387/12/5.
The Grey Street Bridge opened on 30 March 1932. The bridge was officially opened to traffic on 30 March 1932 by Sir John Goodwin, the Governor of Queensland, just eleven days after the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. A large crowd gathered on both sides of the river and 600 invited guests were in attendance.

There was great community interest in the massive public works under construction at the time. It was the era of the Great Depression and massive public works, and Vida Lahey, a distinguished Queensland artist, painted the bridge at least three times during its construction. She also painted other public works including Anzac Square, the State Government Offices (Anzac Square Building), and the Central railway station. Although there was widespread public interest in the bridge, it was eclipsed within ten years by the much larger and more prominent Story Bridge.

An unusual feature of the Grey Street Bridge is that the arches rise through the deck. It is noted that those living in Brisbane tend to regard this as normal for a bridge of this type; however this is in fact most unusual and few bridges around the world, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge, have this feature. The problem confronting Harding Frew was not the span-t- rise ratio of the arch itself, but rather its effect on the design of the deep foundations required at the site.

The bridge was designed to alleviate the traffic on the Victoria Bridge, but by as early as 1939 it was carrying 45% of the cross river traffic and was effectively doing more than it was designed to achieve.
On 5 July 1955, the Council decided to rename the bridge the William Jolly Bridge, in honour of William Alfred Jolly (1881-1955). Jolly was Alderman of Windsor Town Council from 1912 to 1925, including 5 years as Mayor. On 21 February 1925 he was elected first Mayor (later Lord Mayor) of the Greater Brisbane Council for six years until his retirement in 1931. John William Greene was the lord mayor when the bridge was opened. Jolly had moved the motions which led to the construction of the bridge. The Greater Brisbane Act gave the council a charter which vested in the council the power to frame its own legislation and the Council proceeded with a bold policy of civic improvements, including the Grey Street Bridge, the newBrisbane City Hall, Anzac Square, the tramways, water supply and sewerage.

Originally the bridge, roadways and footpaths were illuminated by spherical glass light fittings on cast metal mountings on both sides of the arches and the decorative arches of the tower-like elements. These fittings were replaced by the present lighting in 1964.

Many of the balustrades have been replaced, and prior to 1972 the complete roadway was resurfaced with asphalt. The bridge was first painted in 1974. A cream colour was chosen to reflect the approximate colour of newly poured concrete. Floodlighting was also introduced in 1974.

The original two-span overpass over North Quay, later over Coronation Drive, was replaced by the present single-span structure using precast, prestressed concrete deck units in 1988.

== Description ==
The William Jolly Bridge crosses the Brisbane River at the tip of the South Brisbane peninsula between Grey Street, South Brisbane, and North Quay at the intersection of Skew and Saul Streets on the northern bank. The bridge carries four lanes of traffic with pedestrian paths to either side, and retaining walls return at right angles to the bridge at the northern end supporting North Quay above.

The bridge spans between ground level on the higher northern bank, ramping down to Grey Street inland from the southern bank. To achieve this, the bridge was constructed with three major spans of arched ribs across the river, with two smaller arches at the northern embankment and a single arch at the southern embankment, and a viaduct consisting of 16 spans ramping down to Grey Street to the south. The southern ramping section curves towards the southeast in plan, crossing Montague Road to align with Grey Street. The two smaller arches at the northern embankment are no longer extant, and have been replaced by precast, prestressed concrete deck units above Coronation Drive, which links onto the riverside expressway.

The bridge is constructed of concrete encased steel, with the three major spans of arched ribs rising through the deck. The roadway is partly supported by hangers from the arches which project above, and cross girders and stringers below. The ramping southern section roadway is supported by longitudinal broad flange beams supported by rows of piers, with the southern end abutment being earth filled between reinforced concrete retaining walls.

A misconception at the time of construction was that the concrete encasing was decorative and was only used to hide the structural steelwork of the bridge. This was incorrect as the bridge was designed as a reinforced concrete structure, with the steelwork acting as reinforcing and the concrete carrying a major part of the load. However, the concrete is also used in a decorative manner to represent oversized coursing on the main piers and voussoirs on the arched ribs.

Other decorative features include grotesques to the outer face of some balustrades, and a floral-like motif at either side of the top of the four ornamental tower-like elements. These four tower-like elements frame both entrances to the bridge, surmounting the end piers of the cross-river section, and each consists of an arched opening to a projecting balcony with a stepped crown surmounted by a metal spire. These were originally intended to have the functional purpose of supporting the overhead cables for the proposed electric tramway.

The bridge has cast concrete balustrades, and carefully detailed elements such as the curved ends to the concrete encased cross girders beneath the roadway, and the termination blocks for the upper portions of the arched ribs. Openings in the cross girders below the roadway, intended for a major water pipe which was not installed, are evident.

A pedestrian stair with iron balustrade is located on the southern side of Montague Road and rises through the southwestern footpath. A stair is also located within the North Quay retaining wall on the northeastern side of the bridge connecting North Quay and Coronation Drive. This stair has a solid concrete balustrade, and is no longer accessible from below.

Street lighting has been installed along the length of the bridge, and traffic lights are located at the northern end.

==Traffic use==
The William Jolly Bridge is shared by vehicular traffic, pedestrians and cyclists. It connects Grey Street in South Brisbane to Roma Street on the western edge of the Brisbane central business district. It was constructed with the intention of building tram lines over it and although the tracks were never installed, anchor points for tramway overhead were installed at the top of each arch. These overhead anchor points remain in situ.

===Congestion===
The bridge has two lanes for motor traffic in each direction, and a footpath on each side of the bridge.

Although designed to reduce congestion on the existing Victoria Bridge and within the CBD, the bridge created new congestion issues of its own, as it put considerable pressure on the Normanby Fiveways intersection making it one of Brisbane&#x27;s most congested and dangerous intersections.

By 2006, the Brisbane City Council reported that on a typical weekday, 42000 vehicles crossed the bridge and at peak times both ends of the bridge suffered from congestion. The Go Between Bridge, opened in 2010, was intended to relieve some of the congestion on the William Jolly Bridge; however it has not achieved the level of use anticipated and operates under capacity, possibly because the Go Between Bridge is a toll bridge while the nearby William Jolly Bridge remains free to use.

==In popular culture==

In 2003 the bridge was a location for the filming of &quot;Inspector Gadget 2&quot;.

From 2009, the bridge is being used as a canvas for artistic light shows. Two towers, five metres high, are used to project images onto the bridge. The cost of the project was $2,000,000.

== Heritage listing ==
William Jolly Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 August 1996 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland&#x27;s history.

The William Jolly Bridge was constructed between 1928 and 1932 following the formation of Greater Brisbane in 1925, and was one of the first major capital works of the new city Council being part of a bold policy of civic improvements under the provisions of the Greater Brisbane Act. The construction of the bridge was seen as a symbol of the unification of Greater Brisbane, and the bridge bears the name of the new city Council&#x27;s first Mayor, and later Lord Mayor, William Alfred Jolly, who was Chairman of the Bridges and Ferries Committee and who had moved the motions which led to the construction of the bridge.

The William Jolly Bridge is located at the tip of the South Brisbane peninsula, a location which traditionally has been a point of crossing of the Brisbane River from pre-European settlement. Aboriginal and later European pathways and land use patterns formed the basis for subsequent traffic networks which are reflected in the location of the bridge and associated traffic systems. It was Brisbane&#x27;s second traffic bridge and provided an important transport and communications link between both sides of the river, as well as further impetus for the development of the South Brisbane peninsula.

The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland&#x27;s cultural heritage.

The design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck, which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality.

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

The design of the William Jolly Bridge was intended to reflect the city&#x27;s importance and its civic pride. Constructed of concrete encased steel, the bridge has a monument-like quality, with grotesques and representations of oversized coursing on the main piers and voussoirs on the arched ribs.

The design of the bridge is unusual in its use of three major spans of arched ribs which rise through the deck, which give the bridge a distinctive appearance and a landmark quality.

The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.

The William Jolly Bridge demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement in its design, its use of Gunite (sprayed dry mix concrete), and in the development of the Sand Island method used for the construction of its river piers.

The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland&#x27;s history.

The William Jolly Bridge was designed by AE Harding Frew, a distinguished Brisbane engineer, and was a major work by Queensland contractors Evans Deakin and Co and MR Hornibrook Ltd.

<doc id="182322" wikidata="Q3565904" url="?curid=182322" title="Walter Taylor Bridge">
<text>The Walter Taylor Bridge is a heritage-listed suspension bridge crossing the Brisbane River between Indooroopilly and Chelmer in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It is shared by motor traffic and pedestrians and is the only habitable bridge in the Southern Hemisphere. It was originally known as the Indooroopilly Toll Bridge. The bridge footpath will be closed from 26 August to 30 September 2024 general maintenance. 

==Design==
The bridge is a similar design to the Hercilio Luz Bridge in Florianópolis, Brazil, with the truss carrying the bridge being above the roadway and meeting the cables at non-uniform heights. This means that the suspension cables form the top chord of the truss, and this configuration is known as the Steinman (after its inventor) or Florianópolis type.

The bridge is unique among Brisbane bridges in that the two towers of the bridge house residential accommodation, which were occupied until mid 2010 when the last members of the original tollmaster&#x27;s family moved out. The Chelmer side of the bridge is bounded by a council park. A pontoon adjacent to this park was washed away in the 2011 flood, and to date has not been replaced. The Walter Taylor Bridge is one of four bridges in close proximity to each other. The others are the Albert Bridge, Indooroopilly Railway Bridge, and the Jack Pesch Bridge.

==History==
The bridge was conceived, designed, built and funded by local visionary Walter Taylor, a contractor who lived in Graceville (adjacent to the suburb in Chelmer). Although there was a rail bridge to Indooroopilly and beyond to the northern suburbs of Brisbane, local residents were frustrated because there was no means by which cars could cross the river. Pedestrians had been able to cross the river on the 2 previous Albert Bridges from 1875 to 1893, and from 1895 until the opening of the Walter Taylor Bridge. Construction work began in 1930.

The bridge is a suspension bridge and its support cables are those that were used to hold up the incomplete halves of the Sydney Harbour Bridge during its construction. When the bridge opened it had the longest span of any suspension bridge in Australia.

The bridge was opened on 14 February 1936 by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Leslie Wilson, with the final cost (anchorage to anchorage) coming to £85,000. The bridge was operated by as a toll bridge until the 1960s, with a toll collection booth located at the Northern (Indooroopilly) end (see the video link below). During that time, the bridge was known as the &quot;Indooroopilly Toll Bridge&quot;. It was operated by Indooroopilly Toll Bridge Limited, of which Taylor was a Director and Company Secretary, listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, and with offices in the Central Buildings, Graceville. In its first full year it made a profit of £2581.

After Walter Taylor&#x27;s death in 1955, the bridge was renamed the Walter Taylor Bridge in his honour in 1956.

==Heritage listing==
The bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1992.

<text>The Centenary Bridge is a motorway crossing of the Brisbane River. As it forms part of Brisbane&#x27;s Centenary Motorway, it is used primarily by vehicular traffic, although it includes footpaths for pedestrian traffic. The bridge was used by 85,000 vehicles per day in 2023.

== History ==
Built to service the new Centenary Suburbs of Jindalee, Mount Ommaney and Westlake, the original two lane bridge opened in 1964. It was financed by the developers of the suburbs, LJ Hooker.

The bridge was duplicated to two lanes each way as part of an upgrade of the Centenary Highway and Western Freeway south of Mount Coot-tha Road. The works were officially opened by Russell Hinze, Minister for Main Roads, on 27 March 1987.

During the 1974 floods, the bridge was badly damaged when a barge rammed into its upstream side. The barge blocked the flow of floodwaters under the bridge and there were fears that it would collapse, harming the spectators on it. The Police Commissioner Ray Whitrod ordered that dynamite be used to sink the barge to protect the bridge. When the floodwater receded, the barge was refloated and beached downstream near Fig Tree Pocket to be cut up for scrap. The damage sustained by the bridge required its partial closure for repairs. For two years after the floods, the bridge was reduced to a single lane, with one way traffic controlled by traffic lights at each end of the bridge.

== Bridge duplication ==
A project to duplicate the Centenary Bridge to three lanes each way, at a cost of $298 million, commenced construction on 20 April 2023. The work will involve two stages. The first stage will build a second adjacent bridge which will have four narrow lanes, expected to open in 2025. The second stage will be an upgrade of the current bridge. When completed in 2027, the two bridges will each carry three lanes of traffic.

<text>The Merivale Bridge is a double track railway bridge crossing the Brisbane River. It crosses the Milton Reach of the river, located in between the Go Between Bridge and the William Jolly Bridge. Exclusively a railway crossing, it is located between the stations of South Brisbane and Roma Street, linking the northern and southern elements of the Queensland Rail City network. The Merivale Bridge is the only inner-city rail crossing in Brisbane. By 2016 it was expected to be over capacity, leading the Queensland Government to announce the Cross River Rail project.

The Merivale Bridge opened on 18 November 1978 by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. At the opening with 850 guests, the Premier, described the occasion as &quot;the start of the second stage in the history of Queensland Railways&quot;.

It formed a more direct route into the city for Brisbane&#x27;s southern system suburban trains than the existing route via Corinda. Since 1986 it also has carried the standard gauge line from New South Wales. It was designed by Cameron McNamara Pty Ltd (consulting engineers) and was fabricated and erected by Transfield.

The bridge has been recognised with a number of awards. In 1980 it was named the most outstanding engineering project from the Association of Consulting Engineers of Australia. Judges appreciated the combination of aesthetics and functionality. It also won the 1979 Steel Award.

==History==
It had taken almost a century to get Brisbane&#x27;s north and south rail networks joined by a bridge over the Brisbane River. As far back as 1885, the then Engineer-in-Chief for the Southern Division Railways arranged for the trial rail survey being done in South Brisbane to be extended across the river to the main western line near Countess Street.

In 1889, he arranged to have levels taken for alternative routes to Roma Street tunnel via Herschel Street, and to Central station via a direct route between Turbot and Ann Streets. The Herschel Street route was recommended for adoption, and plans subsequently prepared. However the government decided not to proceed and requested an alternative survey, but that too was held over.

Worried at losing trade to central city businesses, the merchants of South Brisbane fought against the bridge. In 1913, the then Premier requested that plans for a direct route through Ann Street to Albert Square (now King George Square) be put in hand. In 1919, the matter was raised again, but after further pressure from antilobbyists, was once more allowed to lapse.

In 1950, the issue was raised in connection with proposals to electrify the Brisbane suburban network. Surveys and plans were finalised in 1954, and in 1955 the State Government announced its decision to proceed with the construction and initiated land resumptions. However, financial constraints again caused a deferment.

This study was submitted to the Government in 1970. It recommended that the crossing should follow the route, as surveyed in 1890. The Queensland State Cabinet approved the bridge in October 1971. In 1975, a contract was let to Transfield for the construction of the bridge and the line into South Brisbane station. The first pile was driven on 21 August 1975. The bridge took a period of three years and three months to be built.

The Merivale Bridge opened on 18 November 1978 by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. At the opening with 850 guests, the Premier, described the occasion as &quot;the start of the second stage in the history of Queensland Railways&quot;. The first train to use the train was Diesel electric locomotive no. 2422.

The bridge was named after Merivale Street in South Brisbane with which the bridge is aligned.

The bridge was refurbished in 2016.

State Library of Queensland holds John Christsen Merivale Bridge collection which contains 370 chronological photographs of the construction of the bridge, as well as documents and research papers relating to the bridge

<text>Albert Bridge is a heritage-listed railway bridge of steel truss design crossing the Brisbane River between Indooroopilly and Chelmer in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Henry Charles Stanley and built from 1894 to 1895 by John McCormick &amp; Son as a replacement for an earlier bridge lost to flooding in 1893. Both bridges were named in honour of the Prince of Wales, Prince Albert. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.

The Albert Bridge links Indooroopilly and Chelmer railway station. The structure consists of two steel spans supported by masonry abutments and a central concrete pier that is encased in an iron caisson. A footway was provided on the upstream side.

==History==
The first Albert Bridge on the site was completed in june 1876 and enabled the Main Line railway from Grandchester to Ipswich to be extended to reach Brisbane itself. In the early days of settlement, the Brisbane River at Indooroopilly provided an obstacle to the construction of a railway between Brisbane and the mining centre of Ipswich. At this time, a river boat service linked the two centres. The completion of the first Albert Bridge enabled the Ipswich railway line to open in 1875. The bridge facilitated the mass transportation of goods between Ipswich and Brisbane, which previously was only possible through shipping. The first bridge was destroyed in the 1893 flood. In the meantime, ferries were used to transport people and goods across the busy river. This, however, led to the capsize of the ferry &quot;Pearl&quot; disaster in 1896 with the loss of more than 40 lives.

The second and current Albert Bridge was built in 1895. It was designed by Henry Charles Stanley, Queensland&#x27;s Chief Engineer of Railways from 1891 to 1901 and is considered his major work. He designed a &quot;hogsback&quot; steel truss bridge on masonry piers. In designing the bridge as two long spans with one central pier, he tried to minimise the obstruction to flood waters created by multiple piers, which had been the downfall of the first bridge.

Innovations in the design included the attachment of cross girders, protection against derailment, provision against strong wind gusts, and provision for free expansion under varying temperatures. The working drawings and specification were prepared by FL Keir of the Chief Engineer&#x27;s office, and were completed by mid-1893. Keir was also the resident engineer on the site.

In August 1893 the contract was let to Brisbane contractors John McCormick &amp; Son, with a price of . McCormick &amp; Son also later won the contract for the ironwork on the second permanent Victoria Bridge, 1896–97. Expiry date for the Albert Bridge contract was set at 14 December 1894, but it was not opened to traffic until August 1895. A Scottish coal strike held up delivery of the rolled steel for eight months, and removal of the river bedrock for the central pier alone took four months.

A condition of the construction contract was that as much of the work as possible be done in Queensland. Messrs McCormick erected a workshop adjacent to the site at Indooroopilly, and imported machinery necessary for constructing the superstructure and the caisson for the central pier. Up to 240 persons were employed on site at any one time, and quarry workers provided freestone from Pearson&#x27;s quarries at Helidon, the bluestone in the concrete from Jenkin&#x27;s Bundamba quarry, and the granite for the bedstones and cutwater quoins from Mount Crosby. In 1895 the bridge was the largest in Australia of local manufacture.

The most difficult aspect of the work was the construction of the central pier and its foundation caisson. The latter weighed about , rested below high water mark, and was sunk into the rock. The riverbed sand and gravel could be dredged, but divers extracted the rock manually.

The southern span was erected above what remained of the former bridge, and was extended to the centre pier. The old pylons were then removed.

The northern truss was floated into position. The shore end rested on two trolleys, and when the tide was at its highest, specially constructed staging on an old barque took the weight of the other end of the truss from temporary piles. Winches were then used to pull the hulk across the river toward the centre pier, to which the truss was attached.

The cores of the earlier bridge abutments were widened and heightened to take the new superstructure. Parapets were constructed after the trusses had been fixed in place, and were completed in November 1895.

When opened the bridge also catered for pedestrian traffic, until the construction of the nearby Walter Taylor Bridge in 1937.

The Albert Bridge remains one of Australia&#x27;s largest truss bridges. At the time of its completion, as a metal truss bridge it was second only to the first Hawkesbury rail bridge (1889) in span length. The Albert Bridge is still Australia&#x27;s third longest span metal truss bridge, after Brisbane&#x27;s Story Bridge (1940) (Story Bridge) and the second Hawkesbury rail bridge (1945).

The bridge was integral to the southwest railway system linking Brisbane with Ipswich, the Darling Downs, and southeast Queensland. With increased traffic it was supplemented with an adjacent upstream rail bridge in 1957, which together remained the only Brisbane River rail crossing prior to construction of the Merivale Bridge in 1978.

The Albert Bridge currently handles only passenger traffic.

A second unnamed railway bridge is located between the Albert Bridge and the Walter Taylor Bridge. This second crossing was constructed in 1957 as part of the quadruplication of the Ipswich railway line.
== Description ==
The Albert Bridge spans the Brisbane River from Indooroopilly to Chelmer, at the junction of the Chelmer and Indooroopilly reaches.

It is a fully riveted structure consisting of two arched &quot;hogsback&quot; mild steel trusses supported on stone abutments either side, and on a central concrete pier. This pier is encased in an elliptical wrought- iron caisson to low water level, then built up with masonry to the truss bearings.

Each truss is long, high in the middle, wide, and weighs approximately . Their design employs a double-intersection web system of diagonal members, based on the Linville system developed in the United States in the 1860s. They are strengthened by horizontal wind bracing at roadway level, and by elaborate overhead cross bracing.

The double railroad is carried by four longitudinal steel trough girders, with the sides of the troughs acting as guards against derailment. These are supported by massive cross-girders riveted to the underneath of the vertical struts and lower booms of the main trusses, at intervals. The decking consists of ironbark longitudinals bedded on bitumen and sand, and bolted to steel tee bars which connect the trough girders transversely.

A cantilevered wrought iron footway is carried on the upstream side of the bridge.

== Heritage listing ==
The Albert Bridge was registered on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate in 1988. It was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland&#x27;s history.

Albert Bridge at Indooroopilly is significant as an early, large span metal truss bridge in Australia, and remains the country&#x27;s third longest span metal truss bridge. At the time of construction, Albert Bridge was the largest bridge in Australia to be manufactured locally.
Albert Bridge is significant for its contribution to the railway system linking the capital with southern and western Queensland, remaining for over six decades part of the only railway link across the Brisbane River.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

The bridge is highly intact, and provides important physical evidence of late 19th century railway bridge design and construction in Australia.

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

The bridge is important also for its landmark quality and aesthetic contribution to the riverscape along the Indooroopilly reach of the Brisbane River.

The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.

It is important for its innovations in design and implementation, and remains a major example of the design skills of engineer HC Stanley, and of the work of Brisbane contractors John McCormick &amp; Son.

The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland&#x27;s history.

It is important for its innovations in design and implementation, and remains a major example of the design skills of engineer HC Stanley, and of the work of Brisbane contractors John McCormick &amp; Son.

<text>Jozef Gašpar Tiso (, ; 13 October 1887 – 18 April 1947) was a Slovak politician and Catholic priest who served as president of the First Slovak Republic, a client state of Nazi Germany during World War II, from 1939 to 1945. In 1947, after the war, he was executed for treason in Bratislava.

Born in 1887 to Slovak parents in Nagybiccse (today Bytča), then part of Hungary, Austria-Hungary, Tiso studied several languages during his school career, including Hebrew and German. He was introduced to priesthood from an early age, and helped combat local poverty and alcoholism in what is now Slovakia. He joined the Slovak People&#x27;s Party () in 1918 and became party leader in 1938 following the death of Andrej Hlinka. On 14 March 1939, the Slovak Assembly in Bratislava unanimously adopted Law 1/1939 transforming the autonomous Slovak Republic (that was until then part of Czechoslovakia) into an independent country. Two days after Nazi Germany seized the remainder of the Czech Lands, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was proclaimed.

Jozef Tiso, who was already the prime minister of the autonomous Slovakia (under Czechoslovak laws), became the Slovak Republic&#x27;s prime minister, and, in October 1939, he was elected its president.

Tiso collaborated with Germany in deportations of Jews, deporting many Slovak Jews to extermination and concentration camps in Germany and German-occupied Poland, while some Jews in Slovakia were murdered outright. Deportations were executed from 25 March 1942 until 20 October 1942. An anti-fascist partisan insurgency was waged, culminating in the Slovak National Uprising in summer 1944, which was suppressed by German military authorities, with many of its leaders executed. Consequently, on 30 September 1944, deportations of Jews were renewed, with additional 13,500 deported.

When the Soviet Red Army overran the last parts of western Slovakia in April 1945, Tiso fled to Austria and then Germany, where American troops arrested him and then had him extradited back to the restored Czechoslovakia, where he was convicted of high treason, betrayal of the national uprising and collaboration with the Nazis, and then executed by hanging in 1947 and buried in Bratislava. In 2008, his remains were buried in the canonical crypt of the Cathedral in Nitra, Slovakia.

==Early life==
Jozef Tiso was born in Bytča (then ) to Slovak Latin Catholic parents, in Trencsén County, of the Kingdom of Hungary, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was raised in a religious family and studied at the local elementary school. Then, as a good student with a flair for languages, he studied at a lower grammar school in Žilina. The school had clearly Hungarian spirit, since all Slovak grammar schools were closed at the time of his study. Here, he began to use the Hungarian form of his name Tiszó József. 

In 1902, he began to study at higher Piarist grammar school in Nitra. The Bishop of Nitra, Imre Bende, offered him a chance to study for the priesthood at the prestigious Pázmáneum in Vienna. Tiso, taught by several elite professors, became familiar with various philosophies and the newest papal encyclicals. He also extended his language skills. Along with already known Hungarian, German and Latin, he studied Hebrew, Aramaic dialects and Arabic. The school reports describe him mostly as an &quot;excellent&quot;, &quot;exemplary&quot;, and &quot;pious&quot; student. Enrolling in the University of Vienna in 1906, he was ordained a priest in 1910 and graduated as a Doctor of Theology in 1911.

His early ministry was spent as an assistant priest in three parishes in today&#x27;s Slovakia. Tiso was interested in public affairs and performed extensive educational and social work. During his fight against poverty and alcoholism, he may also have adopted some stereotypical and simplified views on Slovak-Jewish relations. Such views were not unusual in the contemporary society, including among priests or other people with higher education. He blamed the Jewish tavern owners for the rising alcoholism and he was also a member of self-help association selling food and clothing cheaper than the local Jewish store. Tiso became a member of Nép párt (Catholic People&#x27;s Party) and contributed to its Slovak journal Kresťan (Christian).

During the World War I, he served as a field curate of the 71st infantry regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army recruited mostly from Slovak soldiers. The regiment suffered heavy losses in Galicia. Tiso got first-hand experience with horrors of war, but also with Germanisation and Russification of the local population. Tiso was inspired by a better organization of the Slovenian national movement. Tiso&#x27;s military career was ended by a serious kidney illness and he was released from the military service. He did not return to his parish in Bánovce, but he was appointed as the Spiritual Director of the Nitra seminary by Bende&#x27;s successor, Vilmos Batthyány. Tiso was also active at this time as a school teacher and journalist. He published his experiences from the war (&quot;The Diary from the Northern Frontline&quot;). In other articles written in a patriotic style, he emphasized the need for good military morale and discipline. 
However, this was nothing unusual, and it reflected a common style of the contemporary press, including a limited set of still printed Slovak newspapers. He also covered religious and educational topics, emphasizing a need for religious literature in Slovak.

Tiso did not belong to politicians active in the pre-war national movement and his pre-war national orientation has been frequently questioned. His political opponents tried to draw him as a Magyarone (Magyarized Slovak) while some Slovak nationalists sought for proofs of his early national orientation. Both views are largely simplified. Tiso carefully avoided national self-categorization language, his behaviour might be framed in a &quot;national indifference&quot; approach – a practice largely spread in Central Europe before 1918. His only criticism targeted the Jews. In some of his pre-1918 writings Tiso complained about the state hierarchy or the ruling Liberal party, but he never denounced the Magyarisation or the Magyar nationalism. At the same time, he was more focused on social and religious activities among the Slovaks without revealing his ethnic or national self-identification. Most importantly, Tiso publicly acted as a loyal subject of the Habsburg dynasty. Interestingly that his writings rather reveals that his identity was stronger linked to the entire monarchy of Austria-Hungary, than to the Kingdom of Hungary, whose citizen he formally was.

== Collapse of Austria-Hungary ==
In the autumn of 1918, Tiso recognized that the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was unsustainable. He also understood that the historical Kingdom of Hungary could not be preserved anymore. Regardless of the formal Czechoslovak declaration of independence, the way to real control of Czechoslovak bodies over Slovakia was not straightforward. Also, it was still unclear to which state Nitra would belong after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary. In these conditions, he began to prepare his readers for the new state and political regime. On 8 December 1918, the Hungarian National Council in Nitra delegated him to negotiate with the Czechoslovak Army which was invited to &quot;restore and maintain public order&quot;. Tiso was named secretary of new Slovak National Council and embraced politics as a career.


==First Czechoslovak republic==
In December 1918, Tiso became a member of the restored Slovak People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Slovenská ľudová strana,&quot; so called &quot;Ľudáks&quot;). The party supported the idea of parliamentary democracy, defended interests of its Slovak Catholic voters and sought Slovak autonomy within the Czecho-Slovakia framework. Tiso, largely unknown before the coup, gradually strengthened his position in the party hierarchy. His elite education, high intelligence, energy, large working experiences with common people and his ability to speak in common terms made him a popular speaker and journalist of the party. 
In 1919, he founded a subsidiary of the party in Nitra and he organized a gymnastic organization, Orol (Eagle), the counterweight of a similar Czech/Czechoslovak organization Sokol. Tiso first ran for parliament in the 1920 Czechoslovak parliamentary election. Although the electoral results from his district were bright spots in what was otherwise a disappointing election for the Ľudáks, the party did not reward him with a legislative seat. Tiso, however, easily claimed one in the 1925 election, which also resulted in a breakthrough victory for the party. Until 1938, he was a fixture in the Czecho-Slovakian parliament in Prague.

In 1921 Tiso was appointed Monsignor by the Vatican, although this appointment lapsed with the later death of Pope Benedict XV. From 1921 to 1923, he served as the secretary to the new Slovak bishop of Nitra, Karol Kmeťko. During the same period, nationalist political agitation earned Tiso two convictions by the Czechoslovak courts for incitement, one of which resulted in a short incarceration. Displeased, Kmeťko dropped him as secretary in 1923, but retained him as a Professor of Theology. In 1924, Tiso left Nitra to become dean of Bánovce nad Bebravou. He remained the Dean of Bánovce for the rest of his political career, returning there regularly every weekend also as a Czechoslovak minister, and as later as president.

In the interwar period, Tiso was a moderate politician and his ability to reach compromises made him a respected mediator of the party. He used more radical rhetoric as a journalist, putting aside much of the anti-Jewish rhetoric of his earlier journalistic activities. He attacked his opponents and did not always control his emotions. However, he usually returned to rational arguments in official political negotiations. Tiso sharply criticized policies of the central government regarding Slovaks and Slovakia. While the party still operated within a democratic framework, Tiso&#x27;s colleague and political rival Vojtech Tuka formed two internal movements to oppose the state or its regime – the first collaborating with Hungarian irredentism and the second led by pro-fascist Rodobrana. Tiso did not participate in these.

In the late 1920s, Tiso became one of the party&#x27;s leaders. When the president of the party Andrej Hlinka traveled in 1926 to the 28th International Eucharistic Congress in Chicago, he delegated Tiso to represent him in the presidium of the party. In his absence, Tiso led complicated negotiations about an entry of HSĽS into the government. He was successful and thus strengthened his position. In January 1927, he became the Czechoslovak Minister of Health and Physical Education. Since HSĽS previously operated as an opposition party and was not able to fulfill all of its promises, the participation in the government led to the loss of credibility. Tiso again proved his speaker skills and supported the decision to participate in the government. As a minister, Tiso successfully realized several important health service projects in Slovakia. Surprisingly, he refused the government ministry flat, staying in one of Prague monasteries. In October 1929, HSĽS left the government after the Tuka affair. Tiso was more inclined than Hlinka to find compromises with other parties to form alliances, but for a decade after 1929 his initiatives were not successful. In 1930, he became the official vice-president of the party and seemed destined to succeed Hlinka. He spent the 1930s competing for Hlinka&#x27;s mantle with party radicals, most notably the rightist Karol Sidor – Tuka was in prison for much of this period for treason.

In 1930, Tiso published &quot;The Ideology of the Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party&quot; explaining his views on the Czech-Slovak relationship. Notably, he claimed sovereignty of the Slovak nation over the territory of Slovakia and indirectly suggested the right of Slovaks also to adopt different solutions for things from the Czechoslovak government in Prague. He repeated the same idea in his parliamentary speeches.

By the middle 1930s, Tiso&#x27;s views shifted toward authoritarian and totalitarian ideas. He repeatedly declared that HSĽS was the only party representing the Slovaks and the only party which spoke for the Slovak nation. These claims played a significant role in the later end of the democratic regime. &quot;One nation, one party, one leader&quot;, Tiso declared at the party congress held in 1936. The party should cover all aspects of the life.

In 1938, with increasing pressure from Nazi Germany and Hungary, the representatives of HSĽS questioned neighboring states on their views for the future of Slovakia. In May 1938, Tiso held secret negotiations with the Hungarian Foreign Minister Affairs Kálmán Kánya during a eucharistic congress in Budapest. He declared that Slovakia might be prepared to rejoin Hungary as an autonomous federal state should Czechoslovakia cease to exist. However, the meeting did not go well. Tiso was disappointed by Kánya&#x27;s attitude and alleged Hungarian historical claims on Slovakia and felt Kánya&#x27;s behaviour was lofty and arrogant. He concluded that Hungary was not seriously interested in a common agreement and was focused more on the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, as was Germany. Therefore, well aware of the weak economic position of Slovakia, the lack of qualified people and an unstable international situation, he felt he was stuck with Czechoslovakia for the time being. When Hlinka died in August 1938, Tiso quickly consolidated control of the Ľudák party. Tiso was an official speaker from the party at Hlinka&#x27;s funeral where he urged national unity and loyalty to the Czechoslovak republic. He, however, continued negotiations with the central government in Prague, explained the goals of potential autonomy and refused a military solution of the Czechoslovak-German crisis.

==Autonomous Slovak Region==
In October 1938, following the Munich Agreement, Germany annexed and occupied the Sudetenland, the main German-speaking parts of Czecho-Slovakia. On 6 October 1938, HSĽS took advantage of the weakening of central government and declared autonomy for Slovakia (some other parties in Slovakia supported this). The next day, he became Prime Minister of the Slovak Autonomous Region.

One of his first tasks was to lead the Czechoslovak delegation during negotiations with Hungary in Komárno preceding the First Vienna Award. Prime Minister Tiso, who had never led a delegation in similar international negotiations, found himself in a difficult position. The central government of the Second Czechoslovak Republic (under the pressure of terrorist actions sponsored by the Hungarian government and after serious changes of the international situation) accepted negotiations before being completely ready, and the government also found itself overloaded while trying to stabilize the situation with Germany. Tiso opposed the proposals of the Hungarian delegation but acted as a flexible and patient negotiator. When the Hungarian delegation refused further discussion, Tiso sought the help of Germany. This had already been promised by German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, if necessary. Later, Tiso was shocked by the First Vienna Award, so much so that he initially refused to sign the protocol. In a radio speech to the citizens, Tiso did not mention Ribbentrop&#x27;s promise, but blamed the Prague government and its &quot;policies of the past twenty years&quot;.

The day before the award, police arrested several Jews at a demonstration of the Hungarian Youth Organization calling for the cession of Komárno to Hungary. Their participation was then used in propaganda blaming the Jews for the result (Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy obviously did not carry out &quot;the wish of the Jewry&quot; but followed their own interests). On 3 November 1938, Tiso met with Jozef Faláth (the head of the &quot;central office for the Jewish question&quot; who had already contacts to Nazi Party politicians in Vienna) and Jozef Kirschbaum. Tiso, who was otherwise a relatively pragmatic politician, adopted an unusually firm solution. On 4 November 1938 he ordered the deportation of Jews &quot;without property&quot;, and later those without citizenship, to the territory now annexed by Hungary. His government then deported more than 7,500 people including elderly people, pregnant women, and at least 570 children under age 15 to no man&#x27;s land in rainy autumn weather. On 7 November, he cancelled the action.

As a prime minister and minister of the interior of the autonomous government, Tiso had extensive powers. In October–December 1938, his government did not share power with any other Slovak public body, because the autonomous parliament was elected only thereafter. During this period, HSĽS forbade activities of all political parties except those that agreed to join the governing coalition &quot;voluntarily&quot; and two parties representing minority populations, the &quot;German Party&quot; and the &quot;Unified Hungarian Party&quot;. HSĽS then organized rigged parliamentary elections. Even before the official announcement of the elections, Tiso told the German newspaper &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; that there would be only one united ballot and Jews could not be elected. The deportations and some other actions of Tiso&#x27;s autonomous government were against the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920.

==Slovak secession==

In February 1939, Tiso entered into negotiations with Germany for a fully independent Slovakia, separated from Czechoslovakia. He held direct meetings with the German representative Arthur Seyss-Inquart, in which Tiso initially expressed doubts as to whether an independent Slovakia would be a viable entity. Czech military units subsequently occupied Slovakia and forced Tiso out of office on 9 March. However the Ruthenians, also resentful of the inclusion of their lands in Czechoslovakia, and the oppressions of the Prague government, now also sought autonomy.

Tiso&#x27;s Catholic-conservative feelings initially inhibited him from what appeared to be revolutionary moves. However, within a few days Hitler invited Tiso to Berlin, and offered assistance for Slovak nationhood. Hitler suggested that Slovakia should declare independence under German protection (i.e.: Protectorate status), and that if not Hungary might annex the remaining territory of Slovakia. Without making an agreement, Tiso now requested the Czecho-Slovak President to call a meeting of the Slovak Diet for 14 March. During that session Tiso made a speech informing the Diet of his conversation with Hitler, confirming that he reserved any move for an independence decision to come from the Slovak Diet. On the initiative of the President of the assembly, Martin Sokol (himself previously a strong proponent of the Czecho-Slovak state with guaranteed autonomy for Slovakia), endorsed a declaration of independence. On 15 March, Germany occupied the remaining rump of Czechoslovakia after Hitler coerced a sick Czech President Emil Hácha into acquiescing.

Slovakia became the Slovak Republic, an independent state (under German protection) which was formally recognised by the Soviet Union and Germany, with &quot;de facto&quot; recognition by the United Kingdom and France (but not by the United States who were largely responsible, in 1919, for the new artificial state of Czechoslovakia). Czech émigrés and the United States considered Slovakia a puppet state of Germany. After the later recognition of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile by Great Britain, the British Foreign Office notified the Czech Foreign Ministry that Britain did not recognise any territorial claims of Czechoslovakia, nor could they commit to any fixed boundaries for the state, nor recognise the legal continuation of Czechoslovakia.

Tiso was initially Prime Minister from 14 March 1939 until 26 October 1939. Tiso not only supported Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland in September 1939 but contributed Slovak troops, which the Germans rewarded by allowing Slovakia to annex 300 square miles of Polish territory. On 1 October 1939, Tiso officially became President of the Slovak People&#x27;s Party. On 26 October, he became President of the Slovak Republic, and appointed Tuka as Prime Minister. After 1942, President Tiso was also styled &quot;Vodca&quot; (&quot;Leader&quot;), an imitation of German &quot;Führer&quot;.

==Anti-semitism and deportation of Jews==
At the Salzburg Conference on 28 July 1940, an agreement was reached to establish a National Socialist regime in Slovakia. Tuka attended the conference, as did Hitler, Tiso, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Alexander Mach (head of the Hlinka Guards), and Franz Karmasin, head of the local Carpathian German minority. As a result of the conference, two state agencies were created to deal with &quot;Jewish affairs&quot;. The &quot;Salzburg Summit&quot; resulted in closer collaboration with Germany, and in Tuka and other political leaders increasing their powers at the expense of Tiso&#x27;s original concept of a Catholic corporate state. The agreement called for dual command by the Slovak People&#x27;s Party and the Hlinka Guard (HSĽS), and also an acceleration in Slovakia&#x27;s anti-Jewish policies. The Nazi government appointed &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; leader Manfred von Killinger as the German representative in Slovakia. Tiso however accepted these changes in subsequent conversation with Hitler. SS Officer Dieter Wisliceny was dispatched to Slovakia to act as an &quot;adviser&quot; on Jewish issues. The Party under Tiso and Tuka&#x27;s leadership aligned itself with Nazi policy by implementing anti-semitic legislation in Slovakia. The main act was the Jewish Code, under which Jews in Slovakia could not own any real estate or luxury goods, were excluded from public office and free occupations, could not participate in sport or cultural events, were excluded from secondary schools and universities, and were required to wear the Star of David in public. Tiso himself had anti-semitic views (as his earlier journalism made clear) which were widespread in Slovakia.

Although there are dissenting opinions by modern politicians on his role in the Jewish deportations from Slovakia, it is clear that, in line with German policy and &quot;suggestions&quot; as well as his earlier anti-semitism, he encouraged these actions, despite condemnation of the deportations from some Slovak bishops. In February 1942, Slovakia became the first Nazi ally to agree to deportations. The Nazis had asked for 20,000 young able-bodied Jews for labour duties. Tiso had hoped that compliance would aid in the return of 120,000 Slovak workers from Germany. In August 1942, after the majority of Slovak Jews had been sent to German-occupied Poland and it became clear that the deportees were being systematically murdered, Tiso gave a speech in Holič in which he called for Slovaks to &quot;cast off your parasite [the Jews]&quot; and justified continuing deportations of Jews from Slovakia. On 30 August, Hitler commented &quot;It is interesting how this little Catholic priest Tiso is sending us the Jews!&quot;. Vatican undersecretary Domenico Tardini complained: &quot;Everyone understands that the Holy See cannot stop Hitler. But who can understand that it does not know how to rein in a priest?&quot;

Later in 1942, amid Vatican protests as news of the fate of the deportees filtered back, and the German advance into the Soviet Union was halted, Slovakia then became the first of Hitler&#x27;s puppet states to shut down the deportations. Mazower wrote: &quot;When the Vatican protested, the government responded with defiance: &#x27;There is no foreign intervention which would stop us on the road to the liberation of Slovakia from Jewry&#x27;, insisted President Tiso&quot;. Distressing scenes at railway yards of deportees being beaten by Hlinka guards had brought protests, including from leading churchmen such as Bishop Pavol Jantausch. The Vatican called in the Slovak ambassador twice to enquire as to what was happening in Slovakia. According to British historian Richard Evans, these interventions &quot;caused Tiso, who after all was still a priest in holy orders, to have second thoughts about the programme&quot;. Giuseppe Burzio and others reported to Tiso that the Germans were murdering the deported Jews. Tiso hesitated and then refused to deport Slovakia&#x27;s 24,000 remaining Jews. According to Mazower, &quot;Church pressure and public anger resulted in perhaps 20,000 Jews being granted exemptions, effectively bringing the deportations there to an end&quot;.

When in 1943 rumours of further deportations emerged, the Papal Nuncio in Istanbul, Msgr. Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) and Burzio helped galvanize the Holy See into intervening in vigorous terms. On 7 April 1943, Burzio challenged Tuka over the rumours of extermination of Slovak Jews. The Vatican then condemned the renewal of the deportations on 5 May and the Slovakian episcopate issued a pastoral letter condemning totalitarianism and antisemitism on 8 May 1943. According to Evans, Tuka was &quot;forced to backtrack by public protests, especially from the Church, which by this time had been convinced of the fate that awaited the deportees. Pressure from the Germans, including a direct confrontation between Hitler and Tiso on 22 April 1943, remained without effect.&quot;

In August 1944, the Slovak National Uprising broke out against the Tiso government. German troops were sent to quell this and with them came Einsatzgruppe H and security police charged with rounding up or murdering Slovakia&#x27;s remaining Jews. During the German occupation, another 13,500 Jews were deported, most of them to Auschwitz, and 5,000 imprisoned. Some were murdered in Slovakia itself, in particular at Kremnička and Nemecká.

Tiso remained in office during the German army&#x27;s occupation, but his presidency was relegated to a mostly titular role as Slovakia lost whatever &quot;de facto&quot; independence it had. Burzio begged Tiso directly to at least spare Catholics of Jewish ancestry from deportation and delivered an admonition from the Pope: &quot;the injustice wrought by his government is harmful to the prestige of his country and enemies will exploit it to discredit clergy and the Church the world over&quot;.

By the end of the Holocaust, more than two-thirds of the Jews living in Slovakia had been murdered.

==Conviction and execution==

Tiso lost all remnants of power when the Soviet Red Army conquered the last parts of western Slovakia in April 1945. He fled first to Austria, then to a Capuchin monastery in Altötting, Bavaria. In June 1945, he was arrested by the Americans and extradited to the reconstituted Czechoslovakia to stand trial in October 1945. On 15 April 1947, the Czechoslovak National Court (Národný súd) found him guilty of many of the allegations against him, and sentenced him to death for &quot;state treason, betrayal of the antifascist partisan insurrection and collaboration with Nazism&quot;.

The court concluded that Tiso&#x27;s government had been responsible for the break-up of the Czechoslovak Republic; and found Tiso guilty of:

* administering a more radical &quot;solution&quot; of the Jewish question
* establishing a totalitarian fascist regime under the slogan &quot;One God, one nation, one organisation&quot; by founding the fascist organisations HSĽS (Hlinka&#x27;s Slovak People&#x27;s Party), Hlinkova garda (Hlinka Guard), and Hlinkova mládež (Hlinka Youth), the last two with compulsory membership
* destroying democracy
* awarding Karl Hermann Frank the Grand Cross following Frank&#x27;s involvement in Czech students&#x27; murders and the Lidice massacre
* allowing the military occupation of the western part of Slovakia by the Wehrmacht, which seized state military assets valued 2 billion Ks and transported them to Nazi Germany
* persecuting and terrorizing the regime&#x27;s 3,000 opponents, who were imprisoned, tortured, and, for some, slaughtered in the Ilava concentration camp
* expropriating the assets of the Czechs and the Jews by the Hlinka Guard
* damaging the state finances in the amount of 8.6 billions Ks due to clearing for Nazi Germany, another 3–4 billion Ks by supplying the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, and 7 billion Ks by secretly supplying the German occupational forces
* inciting of hatred against the Jews, excluding them from public life and economy, and restricting their personal freedom
* approving the Jewish Code, under which Jews in Slovakia were deprived of human rights, and were deported to the Sereď concentration camp and Nováky concentration camp, while Tiso sold some Jews under exceptions to the Code
* approving deportation of 57,837 Jews to German concentration camps in 1942 who were subsequently murdered, and paying for it with 100 million Ks to Nazi Germany
* delivering POWs to the German occupation forces knowing they would be murdered
* allowing the Gestapo and Sicherheitsdienst to imprison, torture, and abduct people, including Slovaks, before the Slovak National Uprising
* ordering the Hlinka Guard and other fascist organisations to help the German occupational forces catch, imprison, torture, and slaughter 4,316 people suspected of involvement in the Uprising and abduct 30,000 people to German concentration camps
* tolerating destruction of numerous villages (e.g. Kľak or Nemecká) by German occupational forces (e.g. Edelweiss (anti-partisan unit)) and the Hlinka Guard
* mobilising for German occupation forces
* allowing German occupational forces to abduct Slovaks for forced labour in Nazi Germany
* ordering civilians to take part in military fortification work for German occupational forces
* approving an eastern part of Slovakia to be declared operational territory of German forces and subjecting the Slovak Army to the German military leadership
* and many other crimes

Tiso was sentenced to death, to deprivation of his civil rights, and to confiscation of all of his property. Tiso appealed to the Czechoslovak president Edvard Beneš and expected a reprieve; his prosecutor had recommended clemency. However, no reprieve was forthcoming. Wearing his clerical outfit, Tiso was hanged in Bratislava on 18 April 1947. The Czechoslovak government buried him secretly to avoid having his grave become a shrine, but far-right followers of Tiso soon identified the grave in the St Martin cemetery in Bratislava as his. Decades later, after a DNA test in April 2008 that confirmed it, the body of Tiso was exhumed and buried in St Emmeram&#x27;s Cathedral in Nitra, in accordance with canon law.

==Legacy==

Under communism, Tiso was formulaically denounced as a clerical Fascist. With the fall of communism in 1989, and the subsequent independence of Slovakia, heated debate began again on his role. James Mace Ward writes in Tiso&#x27;s biography &quot;Priest, Politician, Collaborator&quot; (2013): &quot;At its worst, [the debate] was fuel for an ultranationalist attempt to reconstruct Slovak society, helping to destabilize Czechoslovakia. At its best, the debate inspired a thoughtful reassessment of Tiso and encouraged Slovaks to grapple with the legacy of collaboration.&quot;

Members of the far-right in admiration of Tiso created a memorial grave in Martin cemetery in October of 2008 to commemorate Tiso. It has since been used as an occasional gathering place for many far-right groups, including the People&#x27;s Party Our Slovakia. Ultranationalist propaganda proclaims Tiso as a &quot;martyr&quot; who &quot;sacrificed his life for his belief and nation&quot;, and so tries to paint him as an innocent victim of communism and a saint.

<text>Gusev (; ; ; ) is a town and the administrative center of Gusevsky District of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Pissa and Krasnaya Rivers, near the border with Poland and Lithuania, east of Chernyakhovsk. Population: 

==History==
The settlement of Gumbinnen (from : pumpkin) in the Duchy of Prussia, a vassal duchy of the Kingdom of Poland, was first mentioned in a 1580 deed. A Protestant parish was established in Gumbinnen at the behest of the Hohenzollern thanks to Duke Albert of Prussia about 1545 and the first church was erected in 1582. It became part of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1618, remaining a fief of Poland.
From the 18th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1709 and 1711 the area was devastated by the Great Northern War plague outbreak and had to be redeveloped under the rule of the &quot;Soldier King&quot; Frederick William I of Prussia, who granted Gumbinnen town privileges in 1724 and from 1732 resettled the area with Salzburg Protestants, refugees from Salzburg, who had been expelled by Prince-Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian. The first filial church of the Salzburg Protestants was erected between 1752 and 1752, and was rebuilt in 1840 in a Neoclassical style according to plans designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The church was restored in 1995 by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Central Asia.

From 1815, Gumbinnen was the capital of Regierungsbezirk Gumbinnen, an administrative district of the Province of East Prussia, and became part of the German Empire upon the unification of Germany in 1871. In 1860 the Prussian State railway line from Königsberg to Stallupönen (now Nesterov) was built and the route passed through Gumbinnen, causing the town to grow in economic importance in the region. By the end of the 19th century, Gumbinnen had a foundry, a machine shop, a furniture factory, a clothing mill, two sawmills, several brickworks, and a dairy.
During World War I the town was the site of the Battle of Gumbinnen, a major battle on the Eastern Front. The battle took place nearby in the opening days of the war in August 1914, and Gumbinnen was subsequently occupied by the Russian Army for several months. After the war, a power plant, the Ostpreußenwerk, was built in Gumbinnen and powered much of East Prussia. At the beginning of the Nazi era, Gumbinnen was designated a military sub-region of the Königsberg military area. Near the end of World War II, in 1944, the first of Gumbinnen&#x27;s 24,000 residents began to flee from the advancing Red Army, and a Soviet air attack on 16 October 1944, caused heavy damage to the inner town area. On 22 October 1944, the town was taken by Soviet forces, who engaged in numerous vengeful atrocities against the civilian population before the Wehrmacht retook the town two days later. Although the German forces retook Gumbinnen and managed in late October to stabilize the battle line east of the town, it was quickly re-conquered by the Red Army during the great Soviet East Prussia offensive on 21 January 1945. During the Evacuation of East Prussia, the surviving German residents fled or were expelled.

Following the end of the war, under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference in 1945, the northern part of the former province of East Prussia became a part of the Soviet Union, including Gumbinnen. The town was renamed Gusev, in honour of a Red Army captain, Sergei Ivanovich Gusev, who was killed in action near Gumbinnen in January 1945, and was posthumously given the award of Hero of the Soviet Union on 19 April 1945.
