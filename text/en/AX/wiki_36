<text>Melvin Douglas Lastman (March 9, 1933 – December 11, 2021) was a Canadian businessman and politician, who served as the third mayor of North York from 1973 to 1997 and the 62nd Mayor of Toronto from 1998 to 2003. He was the first person to serve as the mayor of Toronto following the amalgamation of Metro Toronto in 1998 and its six constituent municipalities. Lastman is also known for having founded the Bad Boy Furniture chain.

==Early life==
Lastman was born on March 9, 1933, in Toronto, Canada to Jewish immigrants from Poland, Rose and Louis Lastman. He began his sales career as a child, hawking fruit and vegetables at his family&#x27;s Kensington Market grocery store.

He met Marilyn Bornstein when he was 16 and she was 13, and they were married five years later. He left school after Grade 12 and, with Marilyn&#x27;s help, got a job at a College Street furniture store. He quickly established himself as a successful salesman. He switched to selling appliances and promoted himself as &quot;Mr. Laundry&quot; (alias the &quot;Bad Boy&quot;).

==Business career==
He opened a small frame building at Kennedy Road and Eglinton Avenue in Scarborough, Ontario, selling used appliances.

===Bad Boy Furniture===
At age 22, in 1955, Lastman bought out Heather Hill Appliances and established Bad Boy Furniture.

Having adopted the nickname &quot;the Bad Boy&quot; for himself, he developed Bad Boy Furniture into a chain of stores around the Toronto area. &quot;Bad Boy&quot; Lastman was associated with many publicity stunts, including travelling to the Arctic in the 1960s to &quot;sell a refrigerator to an Eskimo.&quot; Lastman sold the chain in 1975 to run in the Ontario general election. The Bad Boy trademark was ultimately acquired by the large furniture chain The Brick but the new owners allowed it to lapse through lack of use until it expired.

In 1991, Lastman&#x27;s son Blayne and business partner Marvin Kirsh re-launched the chain under the name Bad Boy Furniture Warehouse Ltd, over the objections of the senior Lastman, who felt the economic climate was unsatisfactory. The store was soon memorable to most Ontario television viewers who saw its commercials. The advertisements featured Lastman in a cameo appearance, Blayne in a striped prison uniform, and always ended with the line: &quot;Who&#x27;s better than Bad Boy? Nooobody!&quot; In 2006 it was formally renamed as Lastman&#x27;s Bad Boy and since as Lastman Bad Boy Superstore.

Bad Boy Furniture Warehouse Ltd. filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2023 to deal with $13.7m in debts. After failing to file a proposal to creditors, Bad Boy became officially bankrupt in January 2024; any remaining assets would be sold off to pay creditors.

==Political career==

===North York municipal politics===
Lastman entered politics in 1969, when he ran for and was elected to the North York Board of Control. It was there he met another young motivated rising political figure, Paul Godfrey, who would later serve as Metro Chairman.

====Mayoralty====
On December 4, 1972, Lastman was elected mayor of North York by defeating fellow North York controller Paul Hunt for the open mayoral seat. Lastman took office on January 1, 1973, and was also automatically a member of Metro Council. Lastman was supported by many in North York for operating that city efficiently and effectively, and for keeping property taxes low. He successfully promoted the creation of North York City Centre, which became unofficially known as the &quot;new downtown&quot; of Toronto. At the North York Civic Centre, Mel Lastman Square is named after him.

While supporting development, he also supported the introduction of residential rent controls in the mid-1970s.

In 1975, Lastman ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Progressive Conservative candidate. He lost to former Toronto Mayor, Phil Givens, who was running for the Ontario Liberal Party in the Armourdale electoral district. That provincial election was his only election loss throughout his career.

Lastman joined the Ontario Liberal Party in 1987, although he subsequently claimed that it was the result of a misunderstanding. He agreed to support Norman Gardner&#x27;s bid for the Liberal nomination in Willowdale, and did not realize that he was also purchasing a party membership card in the process. He did not regret his accidental membership, but said he had no long-term loyalty to the party (Globe and Mail, April 28, 1987).

Lastman was a critic of Metropolitan Toronto&#x27;s Metro Hall, attacking Metro Council&#x27;s decision to locate the $220 million building downtown. He argued that it would be more equitable and would have been much cheaper to build the headquarters in the suburbs. Metro Hall was later passed over in favour of City Hall for the future amalgamated city of Toronto. An attempt to put it up for sale only received a maximum bid of $125 million which was far below the construction cost.

Throughout Lastman&#x27;s political career, he was generally supported by the Progressive Conservatives and Liberals, such as Norman Gardner, Mike Colle, Mike Feldman, Joe Volpe, and David Shiner. Though usually opposed by the New Democratic Party, he did cross party lines to work with left-leaning councillors Jack Layton and Olivia Chow.

===Post-amalgamation Toronto mayor===

In 1997, Lastman&#x27;s position was abolished when the provincial government under Mike Harris amalgamated North York with Scarborough, York, East York, Etobicoke, and Old Toronto, creating a single-tier &quot;megacity&quot; forming the new City of Toronto. Lastman ran for the mayoralty of the &quot;megacity&quot; defeating incumbent Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall. Lastman&#x27;s electoral victory was credited to his very strong base of support in the suburban cities, namely North York as well as in Etobicoke and Scarborough. Hall had won the majority of the vote in old Toronto, York and East York.

Lastman gained national attention after multiple snowstorms, including the January Blizzard of 1999, dumped 118 cm (46.5 in) of snow and effectively immobilized the city. He called in the Canadian Army to aid snow removal by use of their equipment to augment police and emergency services. The move was ridiculed by some in other parts of the country, fuelled in part by what was perceived as a frivolous use of resources, although Lastman&#x27;s defenders noted that at the time the army was called in, Toronto was already at a standstill, and that the Environment Canada weather forecast called for another severe storm to hit the city later that week.

Lastman paid back the soldiers by giving them each a free pass to a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game in honour of their hard work. These tickets were obtained free of charge due to an agreement with the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; management claiming that if these soldiers had not come out to shovel the snow, then the Leafs game that day wouldn&#x27;t have had as many people attending. Ten years later, in 2009, Lastman gave an interview to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper, stating he was proud of his decision to bring in the army during the Blizzard of 1999.

Some expected that Lastman would face Independent federal MP John Nunziata in the 2000 municipal election, but Nunziata dispelled the rumours when he found that he could not hold onto his seat in Parliament while campaigning for Mayor. Re-elected in November 2000, with an 80% majority, his closest opponent, civic activist Tooker Gomberg, drew just a little more than 8% of the vote.

Lastman shared Gomberg&#x27;s three main campaign planks; namely, committing Toronto to 100% recycling diversion by 2010 to replace the controversial Adams Mine plan, agreeing with Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to end homelessness in Toronto, and appointing Jane Jacobs, the ethicist and urbanist, to head the Toronto Charter Committee to explore the potential for more autonomy for Toronto. Jacobs had publicly endorsed Gomberg.

Among his accomplishments as mayor of Toronto, Lastman brought World Youth Day to Toronto in 2002. He also succeeded in pushing the construction of the TTC Sheppard line, the first new subway line in decades. He played a key role in developing the Yonge and Sheppard area, notably in the negotiations that had the Empress Walk condominium complex developed and two leading schools refurbished, all without using public funds.

On January 14, 2003, Lastman announced that he would not run for re-election, citing deteriorating health. On November 10, 2003, David Miller was elected out of a field of five leading candidates to succeed Lastman as city mayor.

Lastman sometimes commented publicly on Toronto affairs, such as in 2007 when the city faced a $575 million shortfall and struggled to make service cuts to immediately save $100 million. Lastman also sympathized that provincial downloading had burdened Toronto, but also criticized Miller&#x27;s service cuts as hurting the quality of life while not going far enough to solve the shortfall. Lastman pointed out that spending had increased by $1.5 billion since he left office, and suggested that councillors had to consider measures such as contracting out services and cutting staff.

==Controversies==
In 1993, Lastman saw Bill Clinton impersonator Tim Watters on television, and shortly afterwards contacted him and arranged for a commercial to be shot. The commercial featured Watters dressed as Clinton delivering the classic &quot;Nooobody!&quot; line. While merely a mildly amusing commercial to most of the viewing public, Lastman&#x27;s move attracted attention, as he soon received a letter from the White House requesting that he &quot;cease and desist all unauthorized use of the likeness of the President of the United States of America in advertising of commercial services and products&quot;. Lastman refused to stop airing the commercials, and even produced several more, featuring both Watters and Hillary Clinton impersonator Elaine Kouba. &quot;Last time I checked,&quot; Lastman quipped, &quot;this was Canada, not the 51st state.&quot;

After his wife Marilyn was caught shoplifting from an Eaton&#x27;s store in Toronto, he threatened to kill CITY-TV reporter Adam Vaughan unless he stopped reporting on his family.

In June 2001, shortly before leaving for Mombasa, Kenya to support Toronto&#x27;s bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics, he jokingly said to a reporter &quot;What the hell do I want to go to a place like Mombasa?... I&#x27;m sort of scared about going out there, but the wife is really nervous. I just see myself in a pot of boiling water with all these natives dancing around me.&quot; The remarks sparked a firestorm of controversy, with much speculation that they would offend African IOC members and endanger Toronto&#x27;s bid. Lastman apologized profusely for those remarks. IOC Vice-president Dick Pound later stated that the comments did not affect the outcome of the bid.

In January 2002, Lastman was ridiculed for hugging and shaking hands with members of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang when they held a convention in Toronto. Lastman later claimed that he did not know that the Hells Angels were involved in selling illegal drugs.

During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Lastman did an interview on CNN. When asked about what the World Health Organization was doing about the outbreak, Lastman replied, &quot;They don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about. I don&#x27;t know who this group is. I&#x27;ve never heard of them before.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Having met during the late 1940s when they were both teenagers, 19-year-old Lastman and his childhood sweetheart Marilyn Bornstein, three years his junior, got married in 1952. The couple&#x27;s first child, son Dale, was born in March 1957. Their second son, Blayne, was born during the early 1960s.

In 1988, with Lastman in his seventh consecutive term as mayor of North York, more than 15 years after he first took the office, his wife Marilyn decided to enter local politics in her own right by running for the council seat representing North York’s Ward 13. At the November 1988 municipal election, incumbent Lastman ended up securing his eight mayoral term, while she lost to former school trustee Bob Bradley.

In 1989, Lastman contracted hepatitis C during a surgery. He was one of thousands of Canadians infected from tainted blood products provided by Canadian Red Cross in the 1980s and early 1990s. In his final year in mayoral office, Lastman had spent much of it dealing with his medical conditions, including a bout with cancer.

In late November 2000, weeks after being re-elected for a second term as Toronto mayor—and facing an impending Can$6million retroactive child support lawsuit by former Bad Boy Furniture employee Grace Louie claiming to have been Lastman&#x27;s 14-year mistress who bore him two illegitimate children, Kim (born in September 1958) and Todd Louie (born in March 1962), both of whom were also named as plaintiffs—Lastman called a press conference where, flanked by his wife of 47 years, he admitted to the extramarital affair with Louie while neither confirming nor denying paternity of the two children. Addressing the media, Lastman further claimed to have disclosed the affair to his wife and kids &quot;some years ago&quot; and that they had given him their &quot;unqualified forgiveness&quot;. Grace, Kim, and Todd Louie&#x27;s lawsuit against Lastman further alleged &quot;neglect and mental suffering&quot;, claiming Kim and Todd grew up in poverty while Mel and Marilyn Lastman&#x27;s sons enjoyed a life of privilege. Various details of the Lastman-Louie affair that began in 1957 and ended in 1971 soon became public, including their 1966 trip to Greece, Spain, and Morocco and that in 1974, three years after the relationship ended, Louie accepted a Can$27,500 settlement from Lastman in return for signing a legal release document freeing him from allegations or suggestions that he is the father of the two children. 

Louie&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed in May 2001 by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice judge Mary Lou Benotto who, though not challenging claims by Todd and Kim Louie that Lastman fathered them, ruled that it was too late to claim retroactive child support. The plaintiffs appealed the decision in June 2001; and the case went before the Ontario Court of Appeal where it was dismissed in September 2002 by judge Marc Rosenberg who also ruled the claim &quot;too late&quot; along with an explanation that &quot;child support can not be claimed decades after the plaintiffs are no longer dependents (children)&quot;. The plaintiffs appealed the appeals court ruling, taking the case to the Canadian Supreme Court where it was dismissed in March 2003.

Lastman&#x27;s wife, Marilyn died after a brief illness on January 1, 2020, at the age of 84. One year later, Lastman died of heart failure on December 11, 2021, at the age of 88. He and his wife Marilyn were both laid to rest at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park in North York, Toronto.

<text>The International News Service (INS) was a U.S.-based news agency (newswire) founded by newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst in 1909.

The INS consistently ranked as the third-largest news agency in the U.S., trailing behind its major competitors, the Associated Press and United Press. Despite notable achievements and considerable investments, the INS never managed to surpass its rivals. At its peak, the INS served 19 percent of American daily newspapers (1948). In May 1958 it merged with rival United Press to become United Press International.

== History ==

===Hearst News Service===

The precursor to the International News Service was the Hearst News Service, which was established in 1904. In 1903, the Hearst publishing organization leased a telegraph line from San Francisco to New York, passing through Chicago, to facilitate its expanding newspaper business in these three cities and to share reporting. This service also provided news items to other newspapers, leading to the formation of the Hearst News Service.

===International News Service===

In May 1909, the Hearst publishing organization established the American News Service (ANS), headquartered in New York. The American News Service was formed to sell Hearst&#x27;s wire reports to outside morning papers in the United States. Curtis J. Mar was appointed the first president and general manager of the ANS, succeeded the same year by Richard A. Farrelly. The service was expanded to include foreign news reporting from August 1909.

Shortly after its establishment, the American News Service was split into two divisions to cater to morning and evening newspapers across the United States. In order to reflect its widened news field which now included reporting of the domestic and foreign news, the American News Service was renamed the International News Service (INS) in January 1910. The INS was responsible for providing overnight reports to morning newspapers seven days a week. At the same time, Hearst established the National News Association (NNA) to provide six day a week news report for evening newspapers.

In 1911, the National News Association was dissolved: ultimately, the morning and evening services were integrated and operated under the INS banner.

In 1916, E. Barry Faris joined the INS as a correspondent and news manager in Washington, D.C. Consequently, E. Barry Faris stayed with the INS for the next forty years and became one of the key figures in the organization: he served as an assistant to editorial managers Marlen E. Pew and George G. Shor. In 1927 E. Barry Faris was promoted to general news manager and in 1932 became the editor of the INS, a position he held until the INS and United Press were merged in 1958.

Established two years after Hearst-competitor E.W. Scripps combined three smaller syndicates under his control into United Press Associations, INS battled the other major newswires. It added a picture service, International News Photos, or INP. The Hearst newsreel series &quot;Hearst Metrotone News&quot; (1914–1967) was released as &quot;International Newsreel&quot; from January 1919 to July 1929. Universal Service, another Hearst-owned news agency, merged with International News Service in 1937. Always a distant third to its larger rivals the Associated Press and the United Press, the INS was merged with UP on May 24, 1958, to become UPI.

New York City&#x27;s all-news radio station, WINS, then under Hearst ownership, took its call letters from INS, as did the short-lived (1948–49), DuMont Television Network nightly newscast, &quot;I.N.S. Telenews&quot;.

===Notable employees and contributors===

Among those who worked for INS were future broadcasters William Shirer, Edwin Newman, Bob Clark, Freeman Fulbright, and Irving R. Levine, who in 1950 covered the outbreak of war in Korea for INS. Marion Carpenter, the first woman national press photographer to cover Washington, D.C., and the White House, and to travel with a US president, also had worked for the INS. The INS also counted among its ranks other famous journalists, including Jack Lait, Damon Runyon, Karl Henry von Wiegand, Otto D. Tolischus, Dorothy Thompson, Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker, Pierre J. Huss, Richard Tregaskis, Max Jordan.

==&quot;International News Service v. Associated Press&quot;==
During the early years of World War I, Hearst&#x27;s INS was barred from using Allied telegraph lines, because of reporting of British losses. INS made do by allegedly taking news stories off AP bulletin boards, rewriting them and selling them to other outlets. AP sued INS and the case reached the United States Supreme Court.

The case was considered important in terms of distinguishing between upholding the common law rule of &quot;no copyright in facts&quot;, and applying the common law doctrine of misappropriation through the tort of unfair competition. In &quot;International News Service v. Associated Press&quot; of 1918, Justice Mahlon Pitney wrote for the majority in ruling that INS was infringing on AP&#x27;s &quot;lead-time protection&quot;, and defining it as an unfair business practice. Pitney narrowed the period for which the newly defined proprietary right would apply: this doctrine &quot;postpones participation by complainant&#x27;s competitor in the processes of distribution and reproduction of news that it has not gathered, and only to the extent necessary to prevent that competitor from reaping the fruits of complainant&#x27;s efforts and expenditure.&quot; Justice Louis D. Brandeis wrote a minority opinion, objecting to the court&#x27;s creating a new private property right.

== INS Poll ==
Between 1952 and 1957, members of the International News Service conducted an annual college football poll, similar to those held by rivals at the Associated Press (AP Poll) and United Press (Coaches Poll). Every week during the football season, a group of experts and writers issues a list of the top 10 teams of that week, culminating in a national champion awarded at the end of the season, before the bowl games. The poll ceased after INS merged with UP in 1958.

<text>The Royal Albert Hall is a concert hall on the northern edge of South Kensington, London, England. It has a seating capacity of 5,272.

Since the hall&#x27;s opening by Queen Victoria in 1871, the world&#x27;s leading artists from many performance genres have appeared on its stage. It is the venue for the BBC Proms concerts, which have been held there every summer since 1941. It is host to more than 390 shows in the main auditorium annually, including classical, rock and pop concerts, ballet, opera, film screenings with live orchestral accompaniment, sports, awards ceremonies, school and community events, and charity performances and banquets. A further 400 events are held each year in the non-auditorium spaces. Over its 153-year history, the hall has hosted people from various fields, including meetings held by suffragettes, speeches from Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, and Albert Einstein, fights by Lennox Lewis, exhibition bouts by Muhammad Ali, and concerts from regular performers at the venue such as Eric Clapton and Shirley Bassey.

The hall was originally to have been called the &quot;Central Hall of Arts and Sciences&quot;, but the name was changed to the &quot;Royal Albert Hall of Arts and Sciences&quot; by Queen Victoria upon laying the Hall&#x27;s foundation stone in 1867, in memory of her husband, Prince Albert, who had died six years earlier. It forms the practical part of a memorial to the Prince Consort; the decorative part is the Albert Memorial directly to the north in Kensington Gardens, now separated from the Hall by Kensington Gore.

==History==
===1800s===
In 1851 the Great Exhibition, organised by Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, was held in Hyde Park, London. The Exhibition was a success and led Prince Albert to propose the creation of a group of permanent facilities for the public benefit, which came to be known as Albertopolis. The Exhibition&#x27;s Royal Commission bought Gore House, but it was slow to act, and in 1861 Prince Albert died without having seen his ideas come to fruition. However, a memorial was proposed for Hyde Park, with a Great Hall opposite.

The proposal was approved, and the site was purchased with some of the profits from the Exhibition. The Hall was designed by civil engineers Captain Francis Fowke and Major-General Henry Y. D. Scott of the Royal Engineers and built by Lucas Brothers. The designers were heavily influenced by ancient amphitheatres but had also been exposed to the ideas of Gottfried Semper while he was working at the South Kensington Museum. The recently opened &quot;Cirque d&#x27;Hiver&quot; in Paris was seen in the contemporary press as the design to outdo. The Hall was constructed mainly of Fareham Red brick, with terra cotta block decoration made by Gibbs and Canning of Tamworth.

The dome (designed by Rowland Mason Ordish) was made of wrought iron and glazed. There was a trial assembly of the dome&#x27;s iron framework in Manchester; then it was taken apart again and transported to London by horse and cart. When the time came for the supporting structure to be removed from the dome after reassembly &quot;in situ&quot;, only volunteers remained on site in case the structure collapsed. It did drop – but only by . The Hall was scheduled to be completed by Christmas Day 1870, and the Queen visited a few weeks beforehand to inspect.
The official opening ceremony of the Hall was on 29 March 1871. This had originally been scheduled for 1 May, the twentieth anniversary of the opening of the Great Exhibition, but was brought forward at the request of Queen Victoria. A welcoming speech was given by Edward, the Prince of Wales because the Queen was too overcome to speak; &quot;her only recorded comment on the Hall was that it reminded her of the British constitution&quot;.

The composer, organist, and choir conductor William Carter founded and directed a choir specifically for the opening of Royal Albert Hall. In the concert that followed, the Hall&#x27;s acoustic problems immediately became apparent. Engineers first tried to remove the strong echo by suspending a canvas awning below the dome. This helped and also sheltered concert-goers from the sun, but the problem was not solved: it used to be jokingly said the Hall was &quot;the only place where a British composer could be sure of hearing his work twice&quot;.

In July 1871, French organist Camille Saint-Saëns performed &quot;Church Scene&quot; from &quot;Faust&quot; by Charles Gounod; &quot;The Orchestra&quot; described his performance as &quot;an exceptional and distinguished performer ... the effect was most marvellous.&quot;

Initially lit by gas, the Hall contained a special system by which thousands of gas jets were lit within ten seconds. Though it was demonstrated as early as 1873 in the Hall, full electric lighting was not installed until 1888. During an early trial when a partial installation was made, one disgruntled patron wrote to &quot;The Times&quot;, declaring it to be &quot;a very ghastly and unpleasant innovation&quot;.

In May 1877, Richard Wagner himself conducted the first half of each of the eight concerts which made up the Grand Wagner Festival. After his turn with the baton, he handed it over to conductor Hans Richter and sat in a large armchair on the corner of the stage for the rest of each concert. Wagner&#x27;s wife Cosima, the daughter of Hungarian virtuoso pianist and composer Franz Liszt, was among the audience.

The Wine Society was founded at the Hall on 4 August 1874, after large quantities of cask wine were found in the cellars. A series of lunches were held to publicise the wines, and General Henry Scott proposed a co-operative company to buy and sell wines.

===1900s===

In 1906, Elsie Fogerty founded the Central School of Speech and Drama at the Hall, using its West Theatre, now the Elgar Room, as the school&#x27;s theatre. The school moved to Swiss Cottage in north London in 1957. Whilst the school was based at the Royal Albert Hall, students who graduated from its classes included Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Lynn Redgrave, Harold Pinter, Laurence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft.

In 1911, Russian pianist and composer Sergei Rachmaninoff performed as a part of the London Ballad Concert. The recital included his &#x27;Prelude in C-sharp minor&#x27; and &#x27;Elegie in E-flat minor&#x27; (both from &quot;Morceaux de Fantaisie&quot;).

In 1933, German physicist Albert Einstein led the &#x27;Einstein Meeting&#x27; at the hall for the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics, a British charity.

In 1936, the Hall was the scene of a giant rally celebrating the British Empire on the occasion of the centenary of Joseph Chamberlain&#x27;s birth. In October 1942, the Hall suffered minor damage during World War II bombing, but in general was left mostly untouched as German pilots used the distinctive structure as a landmark.

In 1949, the canvas awning was removed and replaced with fluted aluminium panels below the glass roof, in a new attempt to cure the echo; but the acoustics were not properly tackled until 1969 when large fibreglass acoustic diffusing discs (commonly referred to as &quot;mushrooms&quot; or &quot;flying saucers&quot;) were installed below the ceiling. In 1968, the Hall hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1968 which was broadcast on television live in colour for the first time, and from 1969 to 1988 the Miss World contest was staged in the venue.

From 1996 until 2004, the Hall underwent a programme of renovation and development supported by a £20 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £20m from Arts Council England to enable it to meet the demands of the next century of events and performances. Thirty &quot;discreet projects&quot; were designed and supervised by the architecture and engineering firm BDP without disrupting events. These projects included improved ventilation to the auditorium, more bars and restaurants, improved seating, better technical facilities, and improved backstage areas. Internally, the Circle seating was rebuilt during June 1996 to provide more legroom, better access, and improved sightlines.

===2000s===
The largest project of the ongoing renovation and development was the building of a new south porch – door 12, accommodating a first-floor restaurant, new ground floor box office and subterranean loading bay. Although the exterior of the building was largely unchanged, the south steps leading down to Prince Consort Road were demolished to allow construction of underground vehicle access and a loading bay with accommodation for three HGVs carrying all the equipment brought by shows. The steps were then reconstructed around a new south porch, named The Meitar Foyer after a significant donation from Mr &amp; Mrs Meitar. The porch was built on a similar scale and style to the three pre-existing porches at Door 3, 6 and 9: these works were undertaken by Taylor Woodrow Construction. On 4 June 2004, the project received the Europa Nostra Award for remarkable achievement.

The East (Door 3) and West (Door 9) porches were glazed and new bars opened along with ramps to improve disabled access. The Stalls were rebuilt in a four-week period in 2000 using steel supports allowing more space underneath for two new bars; 1,534 unique pivoting seats were laid – with an addition of 180 prime seats. The Choirs were rebuilt at the same time. The whole building was redecorated in a style that reinforces its Victorian identity. of new carpets were laid in the rooms, stairs, and corridors – specially woven with a border that follows the oval curve of the building.

Between 2002 and 2004, there was a major rebuilding of the great organ (known as the Voice of Jupiter), built by &quot;Father&quot; Henry Willis in 1871 and rebuilt by Harrison &amp; Harrison in 1924 and 1933. The rebuilding was performed by Mander Organs, and it is now the second-largest pipe organ in the British Isles with 9,997 pipes in 147 stops. The largest is the Grand Organ in Liverpool Cathedral which has 10,268 pipes.

===2010s===
During the first half of 2011, changes were made to the backstage areas to relocate and increase the size of crew catering areas under the South Steps away from the stage and create additional dressing rooms nearer to the stage.
From January to May 2013, the Box Office area at Door 12 underwent further modernisation to include a new Café Bar on the ground floor, a new Box Office with shop counters and additional toilets. The design and construction were carried out by contractor 8Build. Upon opening it was renamed &#x27;The Zvi and Ofra Meitar Porch and Foyer.&#x27; owing to a large donation from the couple.

In Autumn 2013, work began on replacing the Victorian steam heating system over three years and improving cooling across the building. This work followed the summer Proms season during which temperatures were unusually high. Further heatwaves led to a rebuild of the Rausing Circle level in 2021 with air-cooling ventilation installed, significantly decreasing heat there during hot weather.

In 2017 work began on a two-story basement extension for use as backstage and archival space to the south-west quadrant of the building. The project is nicknamed the &quot;Great Excavation&quot;, in reference to the Great Exhibition of 1851. A new archive space opened in the extension on 12 October 2023.

In 2018 a Walk of Fame was unveiled at the Hall, with the first eleven recipients of a star including the Suffragettes (who held meetings at the Hall), Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein (both of whom delivered speeches here), Muhammad Ali (who had exhibition events at a venue he dubbed a &#x27;helluva hall&#x27;), and Eric Clapton (who has played the venue over 200 times), among others, who were viewed as &quot;key players&quot; in the building&#x27;s history.

===2020s===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions meant the Hall was closed on 17 March 2020 for the longest time since the Second World War. In December 2020 it reopened for three socially distanced performances but was then closed for a second period, finally reopening to full capacity on 19 July 2021.

On 11 November 2023, before the Festival of Remembrance, King Charles III and Queen Camilla unveiled two bronze statues of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, as part of the Hall&#x27;s 150th anniversary.

==Design==
The Hall, a Grade I listed building, is an ellipse in plan, with its external major and minor axes of 272 and 236 feet (83 and 72 meters), and its internal minor and major axis of . The great glass and wrought-iron dome roofing the Hall is high. The Hall was originally designed with a capacity for 8,000 people and has accommodated as many as 12,000 (although present-day safety restrictions mean the maximum permitted capacity is now 5,272 including standing in the Gallery).

Around the outside of the building is 800-foot–long terracotta mosaic frieze, depicting &quot;The Triumph of Arts and Sciences&quot;, in reference to the Hall&#x27;s dedication. Proceeding counter-clockwise from the north side the sixteen subjects of the frieze are:
# Various Countries of the World bringing in their Offerings to the Exhibition of 1851
# Music
# Sculpture
# Painting
# Princes, Art Patrons and Artists
# Workers in Stone
# Workers in Wood and Brick
# Architecture
# The Infancy of the Arts and Sciences
# Agriculture
# Horticulture and Land Surveying
# Astronomy and Navigation
# A Group of Philosophers, Sages and Students
# Engineering
# The Mechanical Powers
# Pottery and Glassmaking

Above the frieze is an inscription in terracotta letters that combine historical fact and Biblical quotations: 

Below the Arena floor there is room for two 4,000 gallon water tanks, which are used for shows that flood the arena like &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;.


==Events==

The Hall has been affectionately titled &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Village Hall&quot;. The first concert was Arthur Sullivan&#x27;s cantata &quot;On Shore and Sea&quot;, performed on 1 May 1871.

Many events are promoted by the Hall, whilst since the early 1970s promoter Raymond Gubbay has brought a range of events to the Hall including opera, ballet and classical music. Some events include classical and rock concerts, conferences, banquets, ballroom dancing, poetry recitals, educational talks, motor shows, ballet, opera, film screenings and circus shows. It has hosted many sporting events, including boxing, squash, table tennis, basketball, mixed martial arts as it hosted UFC 38 (the first UFC event to be held in the UK), tennis, and even a marathon. It has also hosted wrestling, including in 1991 the first official sumo wrestling tournament to be held outside Japan, with a return appearance scheduled for 2025. Tennis was first played at the Hall in March 1970, and the ATP Champions Tour Masters was played annually from 1997 to 2021.

The hall first hosted boxing in 1918, when it hosted a tournament between British and American servicemen. There was a colour bar in place at the Hall, preventing black boxers from fighting there, between 1923 and 1932. Greats of British boxing such as Frank Bruno, Prince Naseem Hamed, Henry Cooper and Lennox Lewis have all appeared at the venue. The hall&#x27;s storied boxing history was halted in 1999 when it lost its licence to hold boxing and wrestling matches after complaints from residents about noise levels. In 2011, after a legal battle, the licence to host boxing and wrestling events was restored and boxing events resumed in 2012. In 2019 Nicola Adams won the WBO Flyweight title which was the first fight for a world title at the venue since Marco Antonio Barrera took on Paul Lloyd in 1999.
One notable event was a Pink Floyd concert held on 26 June 1969, the night they were banned from ever playing at the Hall again after shooting cannons, nailing things to the stage, and having a man in a gorilla suit roam the audience. At one point, Rick Wright went to the pipe organ and began to play &quot;The End of the Beginning&quot;, the final part of &quot;Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, joined by the brass section of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (led by the conductor, Norman Smith) and the ladies of the Ealing Central Amateur Choir. A portion of the pipe organ recording is included on Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Endless River&quot;.

In November 1969, Petula Clark performed an historical sold out concert, significantly filmed for the first colour broadcast on BBC. &quot;Petula Clark in Concert at The Royal Albert Hall&quot; was screened in colour at 1 minute past midnight on November 15 1969. 

In 1983, Siouxsie and the Banshees performed two sold out concerts at the hall; at the time, their lineup featured the Cure&#x27;s guitarist Robert Smith. The shows were recorded and filmed for the live album and DVD &quot;Nocturne&quot;.

On 22 September 2011, Adele performed a one-night-only concert as part of her tour. The concert was filmed for DVD and screened at cinemas in 26 cities around the world. Her performance debuted at number one in the United States with 96,000 copies sold, the highest one-week tally for a music DVD in four years. After one week, it became the best-selling music DVD of 2011. As of 28 November 2012, it had surpassed sales of one million copies in the United States and sales of three million copies worldwide and makes the first music DVD to surpass sales of one million in the USA since Eagles&#x27; &quot;Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne&quot; in 2005 (Garth Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Ultimate Hits&quot; sold one million copies in 2007, but was a CD/DVD combination). The live version of &quot;Set Fire to the Rain&quot; taken from her performance won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013.

On 2 October 2011, the Hall staged the 25th-anniversary performance of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, which was broadcast live to cinemas across the world and filmed for DVD. Lloyd Webber, the original London cast including Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, and four previous actors of the titular character, among others, were in attendance – Brightman and the previous Phantoms (aside from Crawford) performed an encore.

On 19 November 2012, the Hall hosted the 100th-anniversary performance of the Royal Variety Performance, attended by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with boy-band One Direction among the performers. The Royal Variety Performance has since returned to the Hall in 2015 and every year since 2021.

In 2017 the Hall hosted the 70th British Academy Film Awards, often referred to as the BAFTAs, for the first time in 20 years, replacing the Royal Opera House at which the event had been held since 2008. The BAFTAs were held regularly at the venue until moving to the Royal Festival Hall in 2023. The Olivier Awards also moved to the Albert Hall in 2017 and remain there as of 2025.

Former regular events include &quot;Classical Spectacular&quot;, a Raymond Gubbay production, which performed at the Hall from 1989 to 2022. It combined popular classical music, lights and special effects. Between 1996 and 2008, the Hall hosted the annual &quot;National Television Awards&quot; all of which were hosted by Sir Trevor McDonald, and the &quot;Classic Brit Awards&quot; were hosted annually at the Hall from 2000 to 2013, and again in 2018. The Institute of Directors&#x27; Annual Convention was synonymous with the Hall for over 50 years, taking place most years between 1961 and 2016.

===Regular events===

====Royal Choral Society====
The Royal Choral Society is the longest-running regular performance at the Hall, having given its first performance as the Royal Albert Hall Choral Society on 8 May 1872. From 1876, it established the annual Good Friday performance of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;.

====BBC Proms====

The BBC Sir Henry Wood Promenade Concerts, known as &quot;The Proms&quot;, is a popular annual eight-week summer season of daily classical music concerts and other events at the Hall. In 1941, following the destruction of the Queen&#x27;s Hall in an air raid, the Hall was chosen as the new venue for the Proms. In 1944 with increased danger to the Hall, part of the Proms season was held in the Bedford Corn Exchange. Following the end of World War II the Proms continued being held in the Hall and have done so annually every summer since. The event was founded in 1895, and now each season consists of over 70 concerts, in addition to a series of events at other venues across the United Kingdom. In 2009, the total number of concerts reached 100 for the first time. Jiří Bělohlávek described The Proms as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and most democratic musical festival&quot; of all such events in the world of classical music festivals.

Proms (short for promenade concerts) is a term which arose from the original practice of the audience promenading, or strolling, in some areas during the concert. Proms concert-goers, particularly those who stand, are sometimes described as &quot;Promenaders&quot;, but are most commonly referred to as &quot;Prommers&quot;.

====Cirque du Soleil====
Cirque du Soleil has performed annually, with a show being staged at the start of most years since 1996.

<text>Taxidermy is the art of preserving an animal&#x27;s body by mounting (over an armature) or stuffing, for the purpose of display or study. Animals are often, but not always, portrayed in a lifelike state. The word &quot;taxidermy&quot; describes the process of preserving the animal, but the word is also used to describe the end product, which are called taxidermy mounts or referred to simply as &quot;taxidermy&quot;.

The word &quot;taxidermy&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words (order, arrangement) and (skin). Thus &quot;taxidermy&quot; translates to &quot;arrangement of skin&quot;.

Taxidermy is practiced primarily on vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and less commonly on amphibians) but can also be done to larger insects and arachnids under some circumstances. Taxidermy takes on a number of forms and purposes including hunting trophies and natural history museum displays. Unlike meat harvesting, taxidermy does not require killing an animal that could have otherwise remained alive. Museums use taxidermy as a method to record species, including those that are extinct and threatened, in the form of study skins and life-size mounts. Taxidermy is sometimes also used as a means to memorialize pets.

A person who practices taxidermy is called a taxidermist. They may practice professionally, catering to museums and sportspeople (hunters and fishers), or as amateurs (hobbyists). A taxidermist is aided by familiarity with anatomy, sculpture, painting, and tanning.

==History==


===Tanning and early stuffing techniques===
Preserving animal skins has been practiced throughout human history. For example, embalmed animals have been found with Egyptian mummies.
Although embalming incorporates lifelike poses, it is not considered taxidermy. In the Middle Ages, crude examples of taxidermy were displayed by astrologers and apothecaries. The earliest methods of preservation of birds for natural history cabinets were published in 1748 by René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur in France. Techniques for mounting were described in 1752 by M. B. Stollas. There were several pioneers of taxidermy in France, Germany, Denmark, and England. For a while, clay was used to shape some of the soft parts, but this made specimens heavy.

By the 18th century, a majority of towns had a tannery business. It was around the same time, with the work of Jean-Baptiste Bécœur in particular, that taxidermy became a more serious practice. Louis Dufresne, a taxidermist at the in France, rediscovered Bécœur&#x27;s taxidermy process using arsenical soap and made it known through an article in the &quot;Nouveau dictionnaire d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot; (1803–1804). This technique enabled the museum to build an immense collection of taxidermy birds. In the 19th century, some hunters took their trophies to upholstery shops, where the upholsterers would sew up the animal skins and stuff them with rags and cotton. The term &quot;stuffing&quot; or a &quot;stuffed animal&quot; evolved from this crude form of taxidermy. Professional taxidermists prefer the term &quot;mounting&quot; to &quot;stuffing&quot;. More sophisticated cotton-wrapped wire bodies supporting sewn-on cured skins soon followed.

Dufresne&#x27;s methods spread to England in the early 19th century, where updated and non-toxic methods of preservation were developed by some of the leading naturalists of the day, including Rowland Ward and Montague Brown. Ward established one of the earliest taxidermy firms, Rowland Ward Ltd. of Piccadilly. However, the art of taxidermy remained relatively undeveloped, and the specimens remained stiff and unconvincing.

===Taxidermy as art===
The golden age of taxidermy was during the Victorian era, when mounted animals became a popular part of interior design and decor. English ornithologist John Hancock is considered to be the father of modern taxidermy. An avid collector of birds, which he had shot personally, he began modeling them with clay and casting in plaster.

For the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, he mounted a series of stuffed birds as an exhibit. They generated much interest among the public and scientists alike who considered them superior to earlier models, and they were regarded as the first lifelike and artistic specimens on display. A judge remarked that Hancock&#x27;s exhibit &quot;... will go far towards raising the art of taxidermy to a level with other arts which have hitherto held higher pretensions&quot;.

Hancock&#x27;s display sparked great national interest in taxidermy, and amateur and professional collections for public view proliferated rapidly. Displays of birds were particularly common in middle-class Victorian homes – even Queen Victoria amassed an impressive bird collection. Taxidermy was also increasingly used by the bereaved owners of dead pets to &#x27;resurrect&#x27; them.

===Anthropomorphic taxidermy===

In the late 19th century, a style known as anthropomorphic taxidermy became popular. A &#x27;Victorian whimsy&#x27;, mounted animals were dressed as people or displayed as if engaged in human activities. An early example of this genre was displayed by Herman Ploucquet, from Stuttgart, Germany, at the Great Exhibition in London.

The best-known practitioner in this genre was the English taxidermist Walter Potter, whose most famous work was &quot;The Death and Burial of Cock Robin&quot;. Among his other scenes were &quot;a rat&#x27;s den being raided by the local police rats ... [a] village school ... featuring 48 little rabbits busy writing on tiny slates, while the Kittens&#x27; Tea Party displayed feline etiquette and a game of croquet.&quot; Apart from the simulations of human situations, he had also added examples of bizarrely deformed animals such as two-headed lambs and four-legged chickens. Potter&#x27;s museum was so popular that an extension was built to the platform at Bramber railway station.

Other Victorian taxidermists known for their iconic anthropomorphic taxidermy work are William Hart and his son Edward Hart. They gained recognition with their famous series of dioramas featuring boxing squirrels. Both William and Edward created multiple sets of these dioramas. One 4-piece set of boxing squirrel dioramas (circa 1850) sold at auction in 2013 for record prices. The four dioramas were created as a set (with each diorama portraying the squirrels at a different stage during their boxing match); however, the set was broken up and each was sold separately at the same auction. The set was one of a number they created over the years featuring boxing squirrels.

Famous examples of modern anthropomorphic taxidermy include the work of artist Adele Morse, who gained international attention with her &quot;Stoned Fox&quot; sculpture series, and the work of artist Sarina Brewer, known for her Siamese twin squirrels and flying monkeys partaking in human activities.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, taxidermy was taken forward under the leadership of artists such as Carl Akeley, James L. Clark, William T. Hornaday, Coleman Jonas, Fredrick, and William Kaempfer, and Leon Pray. These and other taxidermists developed anatomically accurate figures which incorporated every detail in artistically interesting poses, with mounts in realistic settings and poses that were considered more appropriate for the species. This was quite a change from the caricatures popularly offered as hunting trophies.

Additional modern uses of Taxidermy have been the use of &quot;Faux Taxidermy&quot; or fake animal heads that draw on the inspiration of traditional taxidermy. Decorating with sculpted fake animal heads that are painted in different colors has become a popular trend in interior design.

===Rogue taxidermy===
Rogue taxidermy (sometimes referred to as &quot;taxidermy art&quot;) is a form of mixed media sculpture. Rogue taxidermy art references traditional trophy or natural history museum taxidermy, but is not always constructed out of taxidermied animals; it can be constructed entirely from synthetic materials. Additionally, rogue taxidermy is not necessarily figurative, as it can be abstract and does not need to resemble an animal. It can be a small decorative object or a large-scale room-sized installation. There is a very broad spectrum of styles within the genre, some of which falls into the category of mainstream art. &quot;Rogue taxidermy&quot; describes a wide variety of work, including work that is classified and exhibited as fine art. Neither the term, nor the genre, emerged from the world of traditional taxidermy. The genre was born from forms of fine art that utilize some of the components found in the construction of a traditional taxidermy mount. The term &quot;rogue taxidermy&quot; was coined in 2004 by an artist collective called The Minnesota Association of Rogue Taxidermists.
The Minneapolis-based group was founded by artists Sarina Brewer, Scott Bibus, and Robert Marbury as a means to unite their respective mediums and differing styles of sculpture.
The definition of rogue taxidermy set forth by the individuals who formed the genre (Brewer, Bibus, and Marbury) is: &quot;A genre of pop-surrealist art characterized by mixed media sculptures containing conventional taxidermy-related materials that are used in an unconventional manner&quot;. Interest in the collective&#x27;s work gave rise to an artistic movement referred to as the Rogue Taxidermy art movement, or alternately, the Taxidermy Art movement. Apart from describing a genre of fine art, the term &quot;rogue taxidermy&quot; has expanded in recent years and has also become an adjective applied to unorthodox forms of traditional taxidermy such as anthropomorphic mounts and composite mounts where two or more animals are spliced together. (e.g.; sideshow gaffs of conjoined &quot;freak&quot; animals and mounts of jackalopes or other fictional creatures) In addition to being the impetus for the art movement, the inception of the genre also marked a resurgence of interest in conventional (traditional) forms of taxidermy.

==Methods==

=== Traditional skin-mount ===
The methods taxidermists practice have been improved over the last century, heightening taxidermic quality and lowering toxicity. The animal is first skinned in a process similar to removing the skin from a chicken prior to cooking. This can be accomplished without opening the body cavity, so the taxidermist usually does not see internal organs or blood. Depending on the type of skin, preserving chemicals are applied or the skin is tanned. It is then either mounted on a mannequin made from wood wool and wire, or a polyurethane form. Clay is used to install glass eyes and can also be used for facial features like cheekbones and a prominent brow bone. Modeling clay can be used to reform features as well; if the appendage was torn or damaged, clay can hold it together and add muscle detail. Forms and eyes are commercially available from a number of suppliers. If not, taxidermists carve or cast their own forms.

Taxidermists seek to continually maintain their skills to ensure attractive, lifelike results. Mounting an animal has long been considered an art form, often involving months of work; not all modern taxidermists trap or hunt for prized specimens.

Animal specimens can be frozen, then thawed at a later date to be skinned and tanned. Numerous measurements are taken of the body. A traditional method that remains popular today involves retaining the original skull and leg bones of a specimen and using these as the basis to create a mannequin made primarily from wood wool (previously tow or hemp wool was used) and galvanised wire. Another method is to mould the carcass in plaster, and then make a copy of the animal using one of several methods. A final mould is then made of polyester resin and glass cloth, from which a polyurethane form is made for final production. The carcass is then removed and the mould is used to produce a cast of the animal called a &#x27;form&#x27;. Forms can also be made by sculpting the animal first in clay. Many companies produce stock forms in various sizes. Glass eyes are then usually added to the display, and in some cases, artificial teeth, jaws, tongue, or for some birds, artificial beaks and legs can be used.

===Freeze-dried mount===
An increasingly popular trend is to freeze-dry the animal. For all intents and purposes, a freeze-dried mount is a mummified animal. The internal organs are removed during preparation; however, all other tissue remains in the body. (The skeleton and all accompanying musculature is still beneath the surface of the skin) The animal is positioned into the desired pose, then placed into the chamber of a special freeze-drying machine designed specifically for this application. The machine freezes the animal and also creates a vacuum in the chamber. Pressure in the chamber helps vaporize moisture in the animal&#x27;s body, allowing it to dry out. The rate of drying depends on vapor pressure. (The higher the pressure, the faster the specimen dries.) Vapor pressure is determined by the temperature of the chamber; the higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure is at a given vacuum. The length of the dry-time is important because rapid freezing creates less tissue distortion (i.e.; shrinkage, warping, and wrinkling) The process can be done with reptiles, birds, and small mammals such as cats, rodents, and some dogs. Large specimens may require up to six months in the freeze dryer before they are completely dry. Freeze-drying is the most popular type of pet preservation. This is because it is the least invasive in terms of what is done to the animal&#x27;s body after death, which is a concern of owners (Most owners do not opt for a traditional skin mount).
In the case of large pets, such as dogs and cats, freeze-drying is also the best way to capture the animal&#x27;s expression as it looked in life (another important concern of owners). Freeze-drying equipment is costly and requires much upkeep. The process is also time-consuming; therefore, freeze-drying is generally an expensive method to preserve an animal. The drawback to this method is that freeze-dried mounts are extremely susceptible to insect damage. This is because they contain large areas of dried tissue (meat and fat) for insects to feed upon. Traditional mounts are far less susceptible because they contain virtually no residual tissues (or none at all). Regardless of how well a taxidermy mount is prepared, all taxidermy is susceptible to insect damage. Taxidermy mounts are targeted by the same beetles and fabric moths that destroy wool sweaters and fur coats and that infest grains and flour in pantries.

===Reproduction mount===
Some methods of creating a trophy mount do not involve preserving the actual body of the animal. Instead, detailed photos and measurements are taken of the animal so a taxidermist can create an exact replica in resin or fiberglass that can be displayed in place of the real animal. No animals are killed in the creation of this type of trophy mount. One situation where this is practiced is in the world of sport fishing where catch and release is becoming increasingly prevalent. Reproduction mounts are commonly created for (among others) trout, bass, and large saltwater species such as the swordfish and blue marlin. Another situation where reproduction trophies are created is when endangered species are involved. Endangered and protected species, such as the rhinoceros, are hunted with rifles loaded with tranquilizer darts rather than real bullets. While the animal is unconscious, the hunter poses for photos with the animal while it is measured for the purpose of creating a replica, or to establish what size of prefabricated fiberglass trophy head can be purchased to most closely approximate the actual animal. The darted animal is not harmed. The hunter then displays the fiberglass head on the wall in lieu of the real animal&#x27;s head to commemorate the experience of the hunt.

===Re-creation mount===
 Re-creation mounts are accurate life-size representations of either extant or extinct species that are created using materials not found on the animal being rendered. They utilize the fur, feathers, and skin of other species of animals. According to the National Taxidermy Association:&quot; &quot;Re-creations, for the purpose of this [competition] category, are defined as renderings which include no natural parts of the animal portrayed. A re-creation may include original carvings and sculptures. A re-creation may use natural parts, provided the parts are not from the species being portrayed. For instance, a re-creation eagle could be constructed using turkey feathers, or a cow hide could be used to simulate African game&quot;.&quot; A famous example of a re-creation mount is a giant panda created by taxidermist Ken Walker that he constructed out of dyed and bleached black bear fur.

===Study skins===
A study skin is a taxidermic zoological specimen prepared in a minimalistic fashion that is concerned only with preserving the animal&#x27;s skin, not the shape of the animal&#x27;s body. As the name implies, study skins are used for scientific study (research), and are housed mainly by museums. A study skin&#x27;s sole purpose is to preserve data, not to replicate an animal in a lifelike state. Museums keep large collections of study skins in order to conduct comparisons of physical characteristics to other study skins of the same species. Study skins are also kept because DNA can be extracted from them when needed at any point in time.

A study skin&#x27;s preparation is extremely basic. After the animal is skinned, fat is methodically scraped off the underside of the hide. The underside of the hide is then rubbed with borax or cedar dust to help it dry faster. The animal is then stuffed with cotton and sewn up. Mammals are laid flat on their belly. Birds are prepared lying on their back. Study skins are dried in these positions to keep the end product as slender and streamlined as possible so large numbers of specimens can be stored side-by-side in flat file drawers, while occupying a minimum amount of space. Since study skins are not prepared with aesthetics in mind they do not have imitation eyes like other taxidermy, and their cotton filling is visible in their eye openings.

<text>Canada Post Corporation (, ), trading as Canada Post (), is a Canadian Crown corporation that functions as the primary postal operator in Canada.

Originally known as Royal Mail Canada (the operating name of the Post Office Department of the Canadian government founded in 1867), the &quot;Canada Post Corporation Act&quot; of 1981 abolished the Post Office Department and created the present-day Crown corporation that provides postal service. The act aimed to set a new direction for the postal service by ensuring its financial security and independence.

Canada Post provided service to more than 16 million addresses and delivered nearly 8.4 billion items in 2022 and consolidated revenue from operations reached $11.11 billion. Delivery takes place via traditional &quot;to the door&quot; service and centralized delivery by 25,000 letter carriers, through a 13,000 vehicle fleet. There are more than 6,200 post offices across the country, a combination of corporate offices and private franchises that are operated by retailers, such as drugstores. In terms of area serviced, Canada Post delivers to a larger area than the postal service of any other nation, including Russia (where Russian Post service in Siberia is limited largely to communities along the railway). As of 2022, nearly 3.5 million rural Canadian customers received residential mail delivery services.

Canada Post operates as a group of companies called The Canada Post Group. It employs approximately 70,000 full and part-time employees. The Corporation holds an interest in Purolator Courier, Innovapost, Progistix-Solutions and Canada Post International Limited.

&quot;Canada Post&quot; (French: ) is the Federal Identity Program name. The legal name is &quot;Canada Post Corporation&quot; in English and in French. During the late 1980s and much of the 1990s, the short forms used in the corporation&#x27;s logo were &quot;Mail&quot; (English) and &quot;&quot; (French), rendered as &quot;Poste Mail&quot; in Québec and &quot;Mail Poste&quot; in the other provinces. Although English-language advertising also still referred to the corporation as &quot;Canada Post&quot;.
==History==
On August 3, 1527, in St. John’s, Newfoundland, the first known letter was sent from present day Canada. While in St. John&#x27;s, John Rut wrote a letter to King Henry VIII about his findings and planned voyage. Mail delivery within Canada first started in 1693 when the Portuguese-born Pedro da Silva was paid to deliver between Quebec City and Montreal. From 1711 to 1851, post offices in British North America were extensions of the British Post Office&#x27;s Royal Mail.

In April 1851, control of postal services in the Province of Canada was transferred from the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom to the newly formed Postmaster General for the Province of Canada. Postal responsibilities in the colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island were also transferred to their local governments that year. The first postage stamp (designed by Sandford Fleming) went into circulation in Canada that same year. 

===Establishment===

It was in 1867 that the newly formed Dominion of Canada created the Post Office Department as a federal government department (The &quot;Act for the Regulation of the Postal Service&quot;) headed by a Cabinet minister, the Postmaster General of Canada. The Act took effect on April 1, 1868, providing a uniform postal service throughout the newly established dominion. The Canadian post office was designed around the British service as created by Sir Rowland Hill, who introduced the concept of charging mail by weight and not destination along with creating the concept of the postage stamp. The new service traded under the name The Royal Mail Canada. It joined the Universal Postal Union in 1878.

Several historical sites related to the history of the Post Office Department of Canada can be visited today. In Ontario, the first Toronto Post Office is still in operation. The site of Scotiabank Arena was once the Canada Post Delivery Building. Also notable are the Vancouver Main Post Office and the Dawson, Yukon, Post Office, a National Historic Site of Canada. In Peggy&#x27;s Cove, Nova Scotia, a nineteenth-century lighthouse acts as a seasonal post office for the tiny coastal community.

=== 20th century ===

Prior to rural mail delivery, many Canadians living outside major cities and towns had little communication with the outside world. On October 10, 1908, the first free rural mail delivery service was instituted in Canada. The extension of residential mail delivery services to all rural Canadian residents was a major achievement for the Post Office Department.

The Post Office Department was an early pioneer of airmail delivery, with the first airmail flight taking place on June 24, 1918, carrying mail from Montreal to Toronto. By 1927, airmail service had expanded to Manitoba, and a regular airmail route between Rimouski, Quebec, Montreal, and Ottawa had been established. In 1937, the Post Office provided Trans-Canada Airlines with airmail contract. Daily airmail service between Vancouver and Montreal began in 1939.

The Post Office Savings Bank system, an agency created by the April 1868 Post Office Act, was phased out in 1968–69.

==== Crisis and reform ====
The 1970s was a difficult decade for the Post Office, with major strikes combined with annual deficits that had hit $600 million by 1981. This state of affairs made politicians want to rethink their strategy for the federal department. It resulted in two years of public debate and input into the future of mail delivery in Canada. The government sought to give the post office more autonomy, in order to make it more commercially viable and to compete against the new threat of private courier services.

On October 16, 1981, the Federal Parliament passed the &quot;Canada Post Corporation Act&quot;, which transformed Canada Post into a Crown corporation to create the &quot;Canada Post Corporation (CPC)&quot;. The legislation also included a measure legally guaranteeing basic postal service to all Canadians. It stipulates that all Canadians have the right to expect mail delivery, regardless of where they live.

In 1985, Canada Post began phasing in community mailboxes instead of door-to-door delivery in new subdivisions. This was met with legal challenges, requiring an Ontario court to rule that the Canada Post Act does not require door-to-door mail delivery.

By 1989, Canada Post had resolved much of its financial troubles, reporting its first profit since 1957. It continued to operate at a consistent profit from 1995 to 2010.

In 1993, Canada Post purchased a majority stake in Purolator Courier. In 2000, it launched Epost, which allowed customers to receive bills from participating merchants and institutions online for free. Epost was discountinued at the end of 2022.

===21st century===
2006 and 2007 saw minor disruptions to rural mail service, with 5,000 out of 847,000 mailboxes temporarily cut off due to concerns with postal worker safety.

For 2007, 2008, and 2009 the corporation was named one of Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers, as published in Maclean&#x27;s magazine. In 2008, a strike by Canada Post&#x27;s administrative worker union — the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) — caused minor issues in customer service.

==== Attempted restructuring and pushback (2010–2017) ====
In 2010, Canada Post began a seven-year modernization effort called Postal Transformation, investing in greater motorization and automation. As part of this initiative, the duties of letter carriers were combined with those of mail service couriers. This resulted complaints of undelivered mail, increased overtime, work stress, and injuries from fatigue and working past dark.

In response, the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) went on its first strike against Canada Post since 1997. The following week, Canada Post locked out CUPW members and the Harper government soon passed a back-to-work motion with binding arbitration. This resulted in a new agreement in 2012 with major concessions from the union, including a $4 per hour drop in starting wages and the loss of bankable sick days. Although CUPW successfully challenged the back-to-work legislation in court, the new agreement remained in force, since it was agreed to by the membership of CUPW. 

Canada Post posted a pretax loss of $253 million in 2011, partly due to the 25-day employee lockout and a $150 million pay equity class action lawsuit. The period from 2012 to 2016 saw a return to financial sustainability for Canada Post, with a net profit of $266 million.

In 2014, Canada Post attempted to phase out door-to-door service in urban centres in favour of community mailboxes, affecting an estimated 32% of Canadian addresses and cutting over 8,000 jobs. The move was widely unpopular, especially for its impacts on seniors and people with disabilities. President and CEO Deepak Chopra became a target of public criticism. In 2015, CUPW filed a federal lawsuit demanding that the roll-out be suspended.

Liberal leader Justin Trudeau promised to stop the phaseout as part of his 2015 Canadian federal election campaign. Following his victory, Canada Post suspended its phaseout. Chopra announced his resignation in summer 2017, leaving three years ahead of his term&#x27;s expiry date. The Liberal government announced an official halt in January 2018. Canada Post did not reintroduce door-to-door delivery to areas affected before April 15, 2016.

==== Financial and labour crises (2018–present) ====

In October 2018, CUPW launched rotating strikes across Canada to negotiate a new agreement with Canada Post. The strikes lasted until late November, when postal workers were ordered back to work by the Trudeau government. This created a 30-day backlog, causing Canada Post to temporarily suspend Canada-bound mail and post $270 million in losses for 2018.

Canada Post struggled to adapt to the growth of e-commerce parcel delivery throughout the 2010s and 2020s, losing more than $3 billion between 2018 and 2024 and racking up over $1 billion in debts. Between 2006 and 2023, its letter deliveries declined from 5.5 billion to 2 billion annually, while parcel revenue rose from $1.6 billion in 2015 to $3.4 billion in 2023. Conversely, its market share in parcel delivery dropped sharply, from 62% in 2019 to 23% in 2023.

Labour relations and costs were persistent challenges throughout this period. In 2023, Canada Post incurred $4.9 billion in labour costs and employee benefits against $6.9 billion in revenue, with parcel delivery costs of $50 to $60 per hour, exceeding industry averages of $40 to $50. In November 2024, a 32-day strike halted operations across Canada.

Canada Post&#x27;s 2023 annual report indicated it may run out of funds by the end of 2025. Unlike many Crown corporations, Canada Post must sustain itself entirely on its own revenues.

==Mail format==

Any letter sent within Canada has the destination address on the centre of its envelope, with a stamp, postal indicia, meter label, or frank mark on the top-right corner of the envelope to acknowledge payment of postage. A return address, although it is not required, can be put on the top-left corner or the back of the envelope in smaller type than the destination address.

Official addressing protocol is for the address to be in block letters, using a fixed-pitch typeface (such as Courier). The first line(s) of the address contain(s) the personal name and internal address of the recipient. The second-to-last line is the post office box, general delivery indicator, or street address, using the shortened name of the street type and no punctuation. The last line consists of the legal place name, a single space, the two-letter province abbreviation, two full spaces, and then the postal code. The country designation is unnecessary if mailed within Canada.

==Major products and services==

The Corporation has a directory of all its products and services called the &quot;Postal Guide&quot; and has divided its range of services into three main categories: Transaction Mail, Parcels and Direct Marketing.

===Transaction mail===

The lettermail service allows the transmission of virtually any paper document. The 2015 to 2018 rate was 85 cents for a standard letter (30 g or less) and $1.20 for a letter between 30 g and 50 g. Proposed change for 2019 is 90 cents and $1.27 for these rates. Rates usually increase in mid-January of each year; for ordinary letters (30 g or less). The rate was regulated by a price-cap formula, linked to the inflation rate. The Corporation now has a &quot;permanent&quot; stamp that is valued at the domestic rate forever, eliminating the need to buy 1 cent stamps after a rate increase. The rates for lettermail are based on weight and size and determine whether the article falls into the aforementioned standard format or in the oversize one.

The Canada Post website documents standards for delivery within Canada:
*Lettermail
*Priority Delivery Standards

Daily cross-country airmail services were introduced in 1939. Canadian municipal delivery service standards are two days, as seen on the Lettermail Delivery Standards Grid.

Mail sent internationally is known as letter-post. It can only contain paper documents (See &quot;Small Packet&quot; below). From 2015 to 2018, the rate for a standard letter is $1.20 if sent to the United States and $2.50 if sent to any other destination.

====Snap Admail====

===Store===

Canada Post operates a store front that sells a variety of stamps, and postal supplies to the public. The personal shop is focused on nominal postage, shipping supplies, and prepaid envelopes while the collectors shop has a selection of limited edition definitive and commemorative stamps as well as coins.

===Issue of stamps===

Although Canada Post is responsible for stamp design and production, the corporation does not actually choose the subjects or the final designs that appear on stamps. That task falls under the jurisdiction of the Stamp Advisory Committee. Their objective is to recommend a stamp program that will have broad-based appeal, regionally and culturally, reflecting Canadian history, heritage, and tradition.

Before Canada Post calls a meeting of the committee, it also welcomes suggestions for stamp subjects from Canadian citizens. Ideas for subjects that have recently appeared on a stamp are declined. The committee works two years in advance and can approve approximately 20 subjects for each year.

Once a stamp subject is selected, Canada Post&#x27;s Stamp Products group conducts research. Designs are commissioned from two firms, both chosen for their expertise. The designs are presented anonymously to the committee. The committee&#x27;s process and selection policy have changed little in the thirty years since it was introduced.

Notable stamps include Canadian definitive postage stamps like the Queen Elizabeth II definitive stamps, the Canada Post millennium stamps, and an assortment of ice hockey and Olympic stamps.

===Tracking numbers and barcodes===

Canada Post use 13 digit alphanumeric tracking numbers / barcodes for their pre-printed labels. Bar codes consist of two letters, followed by eight sequence digits, and a ninth digit which is the check digit. The first two letters are the type of service (RN for registered mail, PG for express post envelopes). The last two characters are the letters CA. The check digit ignores the letters and only concern itself with the first 8 numeric digits. The scheme is to multiply each of those 8 digits by a different weighting factor, (8 6 4 2 3 5 9 7). Add up the total of all of these multiplications and divide by 11. The remainder after dividing by 11 gives a number from 0 to 10. Subtracting this from 11 gives a number from 1 to 11. That result is the check digit, except in the two cases where it is 10 or 11. If 10 it is then changed to a 0, and if 11 then it is changed to a 5. The check digit may be used to verify if a barcode scan is correct, or if a manual entry of the barcode is correct. The system of barcode digit checking is referred to as Modulo 11 or Modulus 11 digit calculation.

Canada Post use 16 digit numeric tracking numbers / barcodes for parcels that originate from a Canada Post post office. The first 7 digits are the reference numbers for the specific post office that the package originated. A Modulus 10 digit calculation is used to verify that the barcode has been read correctly, also referred to as the Luhn algorithm. USPS and Canada Post both use the same system to verify the barcodes, with a difference that USPS uses a 20 digit numeric tracking number. These types of barcodes are referred to as GS1-128.

==Organization and labour relations==

Unlike some Crown corporations, Canada Post is solely sustained through its profits. Many of its business practices require federal approval, including its corporate plan and postage fees.

=== Presidents and CEOs ===
In 1981, Canada Post became a Crown Corporation with a President and CEO.
===Ombudsman===
The Office of the Ombudsman at Canada Post was created in October 1997 as a result of the 1995 Canada Post Mandate Review conducted by an Advisory Panel appointed by the Canadian government.

The Ombudsman is the final appeal authority in resolving postal service complaints. If a complaint is not resolved to the customer&#x27;s satisfaction by Canada Post, the customer can appeal to the Ombudsman. Although the Ombudsman has no legislative power over the Corporation, the recommendations that the office makes to Canada Post can help improve company processes, amend policies and reinforce compliance with procedures.

The Ombudsman is independent of Canada Post staff and management, reporting directly to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mrs. Francine Conn was appointed on July 11, 2011, as the fourth and current Ombudsman at Canada Post. The services offered by the Office of the Ombudsman are free of charge.

=== Labour relations ===

Canada Post has a history of troubled labour relations with its trade unions, particularly the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) and the Letter Carriers Union of Canada (which merged with CUPW in 1989), culminating in periodic strike action that has halted mail service in Canada on different occasions. There were at least 19 strikes, lockouts, and walkouts between 1965 and 1997, including several wildcat strikes. A number of these strikes after the 1970s were countered with strikebreakers and back-to-work legislation from the Canadian parliament.

Nearly all Canada Post employees who are not in the CUPW belong to one of three smaller trade unions. The Canadian Postmasters and Assistants Association covers 12,000 rural workers, the Association of Postal Officials of Canada has 3,400 supervisors and the Union of Postal Communications Employees represents 2,600 technical workers.

In 2004, rural route contractors became employees of Canada Post and joined the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW).

==Letters to Santa Claus==

Canada Post receives millions of letters addressed to Santa Claus each year. In 1974, three Canada Post employees started to respond to mail addressed to Santa in Montreal, Quebec. In 1982, Canada Post rolled out the initiative across Canada and pledged that every letter sent in would receive a reply. A stamp is not required when sending a letter to Santa Claus from Canada and there is a special dedicated postal code, H0H 0H0. About 15,000 current and retired employees respond in many languages to each letter received on behalf of Santa. Over the past 27 years, more than 15 million letters were written by volunteers. Canada Post also receives letters to God and, on occasion, the Easter Bunny.

In 2001, Canada Post started accepting e-mail messages to Santa. In 2006, more than 44,000 email messages were responded to.

The 2024 strike caused Canada Post to remove its deadline for sending letters to Santa when its letters to Santa program was disrupted. Parents were forced to find alternative ways to send their children&#x27;s wishes. Across the country, libraries, businesses and firefighters, amongst others, stepped in to help. The emailSanta.com website, which was created in the wake of the 1997 Canada Post strike as alternative way to send letters to Santa then, saw an increase by over 250 per cent in letters to Santa.

<doc id="179242" wikidata="Q179399" url="?curid=179242" title="Infertility">
<text>Infertility is the inability of a couple to reproduce by natural means. It is usually not the natural state of a healthy adult. Exceptions include children who have not undergone puberty, which is the body&#x27;s start of reproductive capacity. It is also a normal state in women after menopause.

In humans, infertility is the inability to become pregnant after at least one year of unprotected and regular sexual intercourse involving a male and female partner. There are many causes of infertility, including some that medical intervention can treat. Estimates from 1997 suggest that worldwide about five percent of all heterosexual couples have an unresolved problem with infertility. Many more couples, however, experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year with estimates ranging from 12% to 28%.

Male infertility is responsible for 20–30% of infertility cases, while 20–35% are due to female infertility, and 25–40% are due to combined problems in both partners. In 10–20% of cases, no cause is found. Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Male infertility may also be due to retrograde ejaculation, low testosterone, functional azoospermia (in which sperm is not produced or not produced in enough numbers) and obstructive azoospermia in which the pathway for the sperm (such as the vas deferens) is obstructed. The most common cause of female infertility is age, which generally manifests in sparse or absent menstrual periods leading up to menopause. As women age, the number of ovarian follicles and oocytes (eggs) decline, leading to a reduced ovarian reserve. Some women undergo primary ovarian insufficiency (also known as premature menopause) or the loss of ovarian function before age 40 leading to infertility. 85% of infertile couples have an identifiable cause and 15% is designated unexplained infertility. Of the 85% of identified infertility, 25% are due to disordered ovulation (of which 70% of the cases are due to polycystic ovarian syndrome). Tubal infertility, in which there is a structural problem with the fallopian tubes is responsible for 11-67% of infertility in women of child bearing age, with the large range in prevalence due to different populations studied. Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue (which normally lines the uterus) outside of the uterus, accounts for 25-40% of female infertility.

Women who are fertile experience a period of fertility before and during ovulation, and are infertile for the rest of the menstrual cycle. Fertility awareness methods are used to discern when these changes occur by tracking changes in cervical mucus or basal body temperature.
==Definition==
&quot;Demographers tend to define infertility as childlessness in a population of women of reproductive age,&quot; whereas the epidemiological definition refers to &quot;trying for&quot; or &quot;time to&quot; a pregnancy, generally in a population of women exposed to a probability of conception. Currently, female fertility normally peaks in young adulthood and diminishes after 35 with pregnancy occurring rarely after age 50. A female is most fertile within 24 hours of ovulation. Male fertility peaks usually in young adulthood and declines after age 40.

The time needed to pass (during which the couple tries to conceive) for that couple to be diagnosed with infertility differs between different organizations. Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity, rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic. Therefore, data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differ significantly. A couple that tries unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time (often a short period, but definitions vary) is sometimes said to be subfertile, meaning less fertile than a typical couple. Both infertility and subfertility are defined similarly and often used interchangeably, but subfertility is the delay in conceiving within six to twelve months, whereas infertility is the inability to conceive naturally within a full year.

===World Health Organization===
The World Health Organization defines infertility as follows:

===United States===
One definition of infertility that is frequently used in the United States by reproductive endocrinologists, doctors who specialize in infertility, to consider a couple eligible for treatment is:
* a woman under 35 has not conceived after 12 months of contraceptive-free intercourse.
* a woman over 35 has not conceived after six months of contraceptive-free sexual intercourse.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, previous NICE guidelines defined infertility as failure to conceive after regular unprotected sexual intercourse for two years in the absence of known reproductive pathology. Updated NICE guidelines do not include a specific definition, but recommend that &quot;A woman of reproductive age who has not conceived after 1 year of unprotected vaginal sexual intercourse, in the absence of any known cause of infertility, should be offered further clinical assessment and investigation along with her partner, with earlier referral to a specialist if the woman is over 36 years of age.&quot;

===Other definitions===
Researchers commonly base demographic studies on infertility prevalence over a five-year period.

===Primary vs. secondary infertility===
Primary infertility is defined as the absence of a live birth for women who desire a child and have been in a union for at least 12 months, during which they have not used any contraceptives. The World Health Organisation also adds that &#x27;women whose pregnancy spontaneously miscarries, or whose pregnancy results in a still born child, without ever having had a live birth would present with primarily infertility&#x27;.

Secondary infertility is defined as the difficulty in conceiving a live birth in couples who previously had a child.

==Effects==

===Psychological===
The consequences of infertility are mainfold and can include societal repercussions and personal suffering. Advances in assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF, can offer hope to many couples where treatment is available, although barriers exist in terms of medical coverage and affordability. The medicalization of infertility has unwittingly led to a disregard for the emotional responses that couples experience, which include distress, loss of control, stigmatization, and a disruption in the developmental trajectory of adulthood. One of the main challenges in assessing the distress levels in women with infertility is the accuracy of self-report measures. It is possible that women &quot;fake good&quot; in order to appear mentally healthier than they are. It is also possible that women feel a sense of hopefulness/increased optimism prior to initiating infertility treatment, which is when most assessments of distress are collected. Some early studies concluded that infertile women did not report any significant differences in symptoms of anxiety and depression than fertile women. The further into treatment a patient goes, the more often they display symptoms of depression and anxiety. Patients with one treatment failure had significantly higher levels of anxiety, and patients with two failures experienced more depression when compared with those without a history of treatment. However, it has also been shown that the more depressed the infertile woman, the less likely she is to start infertility treatment and the more likely she is to drop out after only one cycle. Researchers have also shown that despite a good prognosis and having the finances available to pay for treatment, discontinuation is most often due to psychological reasons. Fertility does not seem to increase when the women takes antioxidants to reduce the oxidative stress brought by the situation.

Infertility may have psychological effects. Parenthood is one of the major transitions in adult life for both men and women. The stress of the non-fulfilment of a wish for a child has been associated with emotional consequences such as anger, depression, anxiety, marital problems and feelings of worthlessness.
Partners may become more anxious to conceive, increasing sexual dysfunction. Marital discord often develops, especially when they are under pressure to make medical decisions. Women trying to conceive often have depression rates similar to women who have heart disease or cancer. Emotional stress and marital difficulties are greater in couples where the infertility lies with the man.
Male and female partner respond differently to infertility problems. In general, women show higher depression levels than their male partners when dealing with infertility. A possible explanation may be that women feel more responsible and guilty than men during the process of trying to conceive. On the other hand, infertile men experience a psychosomatic distress.

===Social===
Having a child is considered to be important in most societies. Infertile couples may experience social and family pressure leading to a feeling of social isolation. Factors of gender, age, religion, and socioeconomic status are important influences. Societal pressures may affect a couple&#x27;s decision to approach, avoid, or experience an infertility treatment.
Moreover, the socioeconomic status influences the psychology of the infertile couples: low socioeconomic status is associated with increased chances of developing depression.
In many cultures, inability to conceive bears a stigma. In closed social groups, a degree of rejection (or a sense of being rejected by the couple) may cause considerable anxiety and disappointment. Some respond by actively avoiding the issue altogether.

In the United States some treatments for infertility, including diagnostic tests, surgery and therapy for depression, can qualify one for Family and Medical Leave Act leave. It has been suggested that infertility be classified as a form of disability.

=== Sexual ===
Couples that suffer from infertility have a higher risk than other couples to develop sexual dysfunctions. The most common sexual issue facing the couples is a decline of sexual desire and erectile dysfunction.

==Causes==
Male infertility is responsible for 20–30% of infertility cases, while 20–35% are due to female infertility, and 25–40% are due to combined problems in both partners. In 10–20% of cases, no cause is found. The most common cause of female infertility are ovulation problems, usually manifested by scanty or absent menstrual periods. Male infertility is most commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity.

=== Iodine Deficiency ===
Iodine deficiency may lead to infertility.

=== Natural infertility ===
Before puberty, humans are naturally infertile; their gonads have not yet developed the gametes required to reproduce: boys&#x27; testicles have not developed the sperm cells required to impregnate a female; girls have not begun the process of ovulation which activates the fertility of their egg cells (ovulation is confirmed by the first menstrual cycle, known as menarche, which signals the biological possibility of pregnancy). Infertility in children is commonly referred to as &quot;prepubescence&quot; (or being &quot;prepubescent&quot;, an adjective used to also refer to humans without secondary sex characteristics).

The absence of fertility in children is considered a natural part of human growth and child development, as the hypothalamus in their brain is still underdeveloped and cannot release the hormones required to activate the gonads&#x27; gametes. Fertility in children before the ages of eight or nine is considered a disease known as &quot;precocious puberty&quot;. This disease is usually triggered by a brain tumor or other related injury.

=== Delayed puberty ===

Delayed puberty, puberty absent past or occurring later than the average onset (between the ages of ten and fourteen), may be a cause of infertility. In the United States, girls are considered to have delayed puberty if they have not started menstruating by age 16 (alongside lacking breast development by age 13). Boys are considered to have delayed puberty if they lack enlargement of the testicles by age 14. Delayed puberty affects about 2% of adolescents.

Most commonly, puberty may be delayed for several years and still occur normally, in which case it is considered constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a common variation of healthy physical development. Delay of puberty may also occur due to various causes such as malnutrition, various systemic diseases, or defects of the reproductive system (hypogonadism) or the body&#x27;s responsiveness to sex hormones.

=== Immune infertility ===
Antisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. In both men and women, ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm, which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract, inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction, impaired fertilization, influence on the implantation process, and impaired growth and development of the embryo. The antibodies are classified into different groups: There are IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies. They also differ in the location of the spermatozoon they bind on (head, mid piece, tail). Factors contributing to the formation of antisperm antibodies in women are disturbance of normal immunoregulatory mechanisms, infection, violation of the integrity of the mucous membranes, rape and unprotected oral or anal sex. Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood‑testis barrier, trauma and surgery, orchitis, varicocele, infections, prostatitis, testicular cancer, failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
Infections with the following sexually transmitted pathogens have a negative effect on fertility: &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot; and &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;. There is a consistent association of &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot; infection and female reproductive tract syndromes. &quot;M. genitalium&quot; infection is associated with increased risk of infertility.

===Genetic===
Mutations to NR5A1 gene encoding steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) have been found in a small subset of men with non-obstructive male factor infertility where the cause is unknown. Results of one study investigating a cohort of 315 men revealed changes within the hinge region of SF-1 and no rare allelic variants in fertile control men. Affected individuals displayed more severe forms of infertility such as azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia.

Small supernumerary marker chromosomes are abnormal extra chromosomes; they are three times more likely to occur in infertile individuals and account for 0.125% of all infertility cases. See Infertility associated with small supernumerary marker chromosomes and Genetics of infertility#Small supernumerary marker chromosomes and infertility.

=== Other causes ===
Factors that can cause male as well as female infertility are:
* DNA damage
** DNA damage reduces fertility in female ovocytes, as caused by smoking, other xenobiotic DNA damaging agents (such as radiation or chemotherapy) or accumulation of the oxidative DNA damage 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine
** DNA damage reduces fertility in male sperm, as caused by oxidative DNA damage, smoking, other xenobiotic DNA damaging agents (such as drugs or chemotherapy) or other DNA damaging agents including reactive oxygen species, fever or high testicular temperature. The damaged DNA related to infertility manifests itself by the increased susceptibility to denaturation inducible by heat or acid or by the presence of double-strand breaks that can be detected by the TUNEL assay. In this assay, the sperm&#x27;s DNA will be denaturated and renatured. If DNA fragmentation occurs (double and single-strand-breaks) a halo will not appear surrounding the spermatozoas, but if the spermatozoa does not have DNA damaged, a halo surrounding the spermatozoa could be visualized under the microscope.
* General factors
** Diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease, adrenal disease
* Hypothalamic-pituitary factors
** Hyperprolactinemia
** Hypopituitarism
** The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with an increased risk of unexplained subfertility with an odds ratio of 1.5 and 95% confidence interval of 1.1–2.0.
* Environmental factors
** Toxins such as glues, volatile organic solvents or silicones, physical agents, flame retardants, chemical dusts, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides. Tobacco smokers are 60% more likely to be infertile than non-smokers.

Other diseases such as chlamydia, and gonorrhea can also cause infertility, due to internal scarring (fallopian tube obstruction).

*Body mass, the BMI (body mass index) (either being too high or too low) may be a contributor to infertility.
** Obesity: Obesity can have a significant impact on male and female fertility. In females, a BMI above 27 increases the risk of infertility 3-fold. Obese women have a higher rate of recurrent, early miscarriage compared to non-obese women. In males, an increase in BMI above 30 may be associated with reduced sperm quality and impaired spermatogenesis leading to infertility. In males, a high BMI is also associated with low testosterone levels (secondary hypogonadism) and erectile dysfunction which contributes to infertility.
** Low weight: females with a very low BMI may have infertility. Common causes of low BMI leading to infertility include anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, excessive exercise or relative energy deficiency in sport. Infertility in females with a low BMI is usually due to functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to stress induced inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis.

===Females===

The following causes of infertility may only be found in females.
For a woman to conceive, certain things have to happen: vaginal intercourse must take place around the time when an egg is released from her ovary; the system that produces eggs has to be working at optimum levels; and her hormones must be balanced.

For women, problems with fertilization arise mainly from either structural problems in the fallopian tube or uterus or problems releasing eggs. Infertility may be caused by blockage of the fallopian tube due to malformations, infections such as chlamydia or scar tissue. For example, endometriosis can cause infertility with the growth of endometrial tissue in the fallopian tubes or around the ovaries. Endometriosis is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older, especially when postponed childbirth has taken place.

Another major cause of infertility in women may be the inability to ovulate. Ovulatory disorders make up 25% of the known causes of female infertility. Oligo-ovulation or anovulation results in infertility because no oocyte will be released monthly. In the absence of an oocyte, there is no opportunity for fertilization and pregnancy. World Health Organization subdivided ovulatory disorders into four classes:
* Hypogonadotropic hypogonadal anovulation: i.e., hypothalamic amenorrhea
* Normogonadotropic normoestrogenic anovulation: i.e., polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
* Hypergonadotropic hypoestrogenic anovulation: i.e., premature ovarian failure
* Hyperprolactinemic anovulation: i.e., pituitary adenoma

Malformation of the eggs themselves may complicate conception. For example, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is when the eggs only partially develop within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones. Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs. In this case, synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid (Clomiphene citrate) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries.

Other factors that can affect a woman&#x27;s chances of conceiving include being overweight or underweight, or her age as female fertility declines after the age of 30.

Sometimes it can be a combination of factors, and sometimes a clear cause is never established.

Common causes of infertility of females include:
* ovulation problems (e.g. PCOS, the leading reason why women present to fertility clinics due to anovulatory infertility)
* tubal blockage
* pelvic inflammatory disease caused by infections like tuberculosis
* age-related factors
* uterine problems
* previous tubal ligation
* endometriosis
* advanced maternal age
* immune infertility

===Males===

Male infertility is defined as the inability of a male to make a fertile female pregnant, for a minimum of at least one year of unprotected intercourse. Male infertility is estimated to contribute to 35% infertility in couples. There are multiple causes for male infertility including endocrine disorders (usually due to hypogonadism) at an estimated 2% to 5%, sperm transport disorders at 5%, primary testicular defects (which includes abnormal sperm parameters without any identifiable cause) at 65% to 80% and idiopathic (where an infertile male has normal sperm and semen parameters) at 10% to 20%.

The main cause of male infertility is low semen quality. In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate, infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems, drugs, radiation, or infection. There may be testicular malformations, hormone imbalance, or blockage of the man&#x27;s duct system. Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions, some may be indefinite.
Infertility associated with viable, but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia. The sperm must provide the zygote with DNA, centrioles, and activation factor for the embryo to develop. A defect in any of these sperm structures may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis. Antisperm antibodies cause immune infertility. Cystic fibrosis can lead to infertility in men by blocking the vas deferens.

Adeno-associated virus infection has been linked to poor sperm quality and may contribute to male infertility, based on small observational studies.

===Unexplained infertility===

In the US, up to 15% of infertile couples have unexplained infertility, in which no identifiable cause is found. polymorphisms in folate pathway genes may be a cause for fertility complications in some women with unexplained infertility. Epigenetic modifications in sperm may be also be responsible for unexplaiend infertility.

==Diagnosis==

If both partners are young and healthy and have been trying to conceive for one year without success, a visit to a physician or women&#x27;s health nurse practitioner (WHNP) could help to highlight potential medical problems earlier rather than later. The doctor or WHNP may also be able to suggest lifestyle changes to increase the chances of conceiving.

However, there are instances where couples should seek reproductive counseling after only 6 months of trying for a pregnancy:

*The woman is over 35 years old.
*The woman has a history of endometriosis.
*The woman has infrequent or irregular menses.
*There is a male factor involved.

A doctor or WHNP takes a medical history and gives a physical examination. They can also carry out some basic tests on both partners to see if there is an identifiable reason for not having achieved a pregnancy. Among these tests, blood tests are common and may include serologies to detect infections such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), HIV, syphilis, and rubella. Optional tests like karyotypes can also be performed. For females, specific tests might include measuring antimüllerian hormone (AMH) to assess ovarian reserve, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), and vitamin D levels, which can influence fertility. If necessary, they refer patients to a fertility clinic or local hospital for more specialized tests. The results of these tests help determine the best fertility treatment.

==Treatment==
Treatment depends on the cause of infertility, but may include counselling, fertility treatments, which include in vitro fertilization. According to ESHRE recommendations, couples with an estimated live birth rate of 40% or higher per year are encouraged to continue aiming for a spontaneous pregnancy. Drugs used include clomiphene citrate, human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, and aromatase inhibitors.

=== Medical treatments ===
Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used for induction of ovulation. It works by blocking the negative feedback from estrogen, creating a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) increase, which causes release of leutenizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH act on the ovaries to increase follicle growth and lead to ovulation. Letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor which reduces estradiol levels and increases levels of FSH and LH which can stimulate ovarian follicle maturation and ovulation. Letrozole is the preferred treatment in those with infertility due to PCOS and is associated with a higher pregnancy rate than other treatments. Both clomiphene and letrozole have a risk of a multiple gestation pregnancy, with the risk being less than 10%. Those with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism require pulsatile GnRH therapy, which is associated with a 93-100% pregnancy rate after 6 months of therapy. The risk of a multiple gestation pregnancy with gonadotropins is 36%. Ovarian stimulation with clomiphene, aromatase inhibitors, or gonadotropins (especially when combined with intrauterine insemination) have a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome which may occur in 1-5% of cycles and presents as ascites, electrolyte abnormalities and blood clots.

Fertility treatments or medications do not increase the risk of breast, ovarian or endometrial cancers.

Metformin does not increase the rate of live births in those with infertility (including in those with PCOS) and its use is not recommended.

In some cases, in vitro fertilization (IVF) is used in which induced ovarian follicle stimulation is followed by extraction of oocytes from the ovaries. The oocytes are then fertilized in vitro by sperm using Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and the fertilized eggs are re-introduced into the uterus in a procedure called embryo transfer. ICSI was first developed in 1978 by Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe.

Ovarian stimulation (such as with clomiphene) combined with in-vitro fertilization or intra-uterine insemination have lower success rates with increasing age.

Sperm or oocyte donors with in vitro fertilization and gestational carriers are sometimes used for gay couples, those with severe medical conditions which make pregnancy dangerous or precluding pregnancy, those with severe infertility or females with a non-functioning uterus.

===Tourism===

&quot;Fertility tourism&quot; is the practice of traveling to another country for fertility treatments.

===Stem cell therapy===
There are several experimental treatments related to stem cell therapy not yet routinely used in reproductive medicine. These treatments may provide the opportunity for a live birth for people who lack of gametes and also for same-sex couples and single people who want to have offspring. Theoretically, with this therapy, artificial gametes can be produced &quot;in vitro&quot;.
* Spermatogonial stem cells transplant takes places in the seminiferous tubule with the patient experiencing spermatogenesis. This therapy is sometimes used cancer patients, whose sperm have been destroyed due to the gonadotoxic treatment.
* Ovarian stem cells may be used to generate new oocytes which can then be implanted in the uterus after in-vitro fertilization. This therapy is still in the experimental phase.

==Epidemiology==
Prevalence of infertility varies depending on the definition, i.e. on the time span involved in the failure to conceive.
* Infertility rates have increased by 4% since the 1980s, mostly from problems with fecundity due to an increase in age.
* Fertility problems affect one in seven couples in the UK. Most couples (about 84%) who have regular sexual intercourse (that is, every two to three days) and who do not use contraception get pregnant within a year. About 95 out of 100 couples who are trying to get pregnant do so within two years.
* Women become less fertile as they get older. For women aged 35, about 94% who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse get pregnant after three years of trying. For women aged 38, however, only about 77%. The effect of age upon men&#x27;s fertility is less clear.
* In people going forward for IVF in the UK, roughly half of fertility problems with a diagnosed cause are due to problems with the man, and about half due to problems with the woman. However, about one in five cases of infertility have no clear diagnosed cause.
* In Britain, male factor infertility accounts for 25% of infertile couples, while 25% remain unexplained. 50% are female causes with 25% being due to anovulation and 25% tubal problems/other.
* In Sweden, approximately 10% of couples wanting children are infertile. In approximately one-third of these cases the man is the factor, in one third the woman is the factor, and in the remaining third the infertility is a product of factors on both parts.
* In many lower-income countries, estimating infertility is difficult due to incomplete information and infertility and childlessness stigmas.
* Data on income-limited individuals, male infertility, and fertility within non-traditional families may be limited due to traditional social norms. Historical data on fertility and infertility is limited as any form of study or tracking only began in the early 20th century. Per one account, &quot;The invisibility of marginalised social groups in infertility tracking reflects broader social beliefs about who can and should reproduce. The offspring of privileged social groups are seen as a boon to society. The offspring of marginalised groups are perceived as a burden.&quot;

==Society and culture==
Perhaps except for infertility in science fiction, films and other fiction depicting emotional struggles of assisted reproductive technology have had an upswing first in the latter part of the 2000s decade, although the techniques have been available for decades. Yet, the number of people that can relate to it by personal experience in one way or another is ever-growing, and the variety of trials and struggles is huge.

Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot; contains a depiction of infertility in an extended life montage that lasts the first few minutes of the film.

&quot;Other individual examples are referred to individual sub-articles of assisted reproductive technology&quot;

===Ethics===
There are several ethical issues associated with infertility and its treatment.
* High-cost treatments are out of financial reach for some couples.
* Debate over whether health insurance companies (e.g. in the US) should be required to cover infertility treatment.
* Allocation of medical resources that could be used elsewhere
* The legal status of embryos fertilized in vitro and not transferred in vivo. (See also beginning of pregnancy controversy).
* Opposition to the destruction of embryos not transferred in vivo.
* IVF and other fertility treatments have resulted in an increase in multiple births, provoking ethical analysis because of the link between multiple pregnancies, premature birth, and a host of health problems.
* Religious leaders&#x27; opinions on fertility treatments; for example, the Roman Catholic Church views infertility as a calling to adopt or to use natural treatments (medication, surgery, or cycle charting) and members must reject assisted reproductive technologies.
* Infertility caused by DNA defects on the Y chromosome is passed on from father to son. If natural selection is the primary error correction mechanism that prevents random mutations on the Y chromosome, then fertility treatments for men with abnormal sperm (in particular ICSI) only defer the underlying problem to the next male generation.
* Specific procedures, such as gestational surrogacy, have led to numerous ethical issues, particularly when people living in one country contract for surrogacy in another (transnational surrogacy).

Many countries have special frameworks for dealing with the ethical and social issues around fertility treatment.
* One of the best known is the HFEA – The UK&#x27;s regulator for fertility treatment and embryo research. This was set up on 1 August 1991 following a detailed commission of enquiry led by Mary Warnock in the 1980s
* A similar model to the HFEA has been adopted by the rest of the countries in the European Union. Each country has its own body or bodies responsible for the inspection and licensing of fertility treatment under the EU Tissues and Cells directive
* Regulatory bodies are also found in Canada and in the state of Victoria in Australia

<text>No Angels are an all-female pop group from Germany, formed in 2000. Originally a quintet, consisting of band members Nadja Benaissa, Lucy Diakovska, Sandy Mölling, Vanessa Petruo, and Jessica Wahls, they originated on the debut season of the German adaptation of the talent series &quot;Popstars&quot; and were one of the first television-cast acts to achieve sustainable success throughout Central Europe in the early 2000s. Following a major success with record-breaking single &quot;Daylight in Your Eyes&quot; and debut album &quot;Elle&#x27;ments&quot; in 2001, a series of hit records established their position as one of the most successful female band vocalists to emerge in the early decade. With four number-one hits, four number-one albums and record sales of more than 5.0 million, they became one of the most successful acts in German music history, winning three ECHOs, a World Music Award, a NRJ Music Award, two Comets, a Bambi and a Goldene Kamera.

In fall 2003, the members went their separate ways due to lasting exhaustion, focusing on their individual solo careers in music, theatre, television and film. In 2007, four members of the original line-up re-formed permanently and recorded their first studio album in over four years, &quot;Destiny&quot; (2007). A year after, the group represented Germany at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia, where they finished 23rd with their song &quot;Disappear&quot;. A second post-reunion album, titled &quot;Welcome to the Dance&quot; and released in 2009, failed commercially. In September 2010, Benaissa officially left the band due to private reasons, leaving No Angels as a trio before they went into another hiatus. In early 2021, the band reformed as a quartet, commemorating with their 2001 debut. Their sixth studio album &quot;20&quot;, a collection of re-recordings and new songs, was released in June 2021 and became their fourth chart topper.

==History==

===2000: Formation on &quot;Popstars&quot;===
The members of No Angels were selected on the RTL2 channel&#x27;s first series of &quot;Popstars&quot;, a reality talent show which set about producing a five-piece girl group. Acquired by Tresor TV television producer Holger Roost-Macias at the MIPTV Media Market event in Cannes, France, in 2000, the series was the third adaptation of the format following both an Australian and a New Zealand version. In August and September of the same year, over 4,300 hopefuls turned up to auditions in Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt, Leipzig, Cologne, Oberhausen, Stuttgart and Munich which required both singing and dancing experience. The judges consisted of Dutch entertainer Simone Angel, concert booker Mario M. Mendryzcki and Rainer Moslener, an A&amp;R director of Polydor Records.

32 out of 200 girls eventually made it from the local recall shows to Mallorca, Spain, to get trained in singing, dancing, and fitness. While the judges continued eliminating two or three girls each day with the help of choreographer Detlef Soost and British vocal coach Robert Bicknel, eleven finalists remained and were sent home to prepare. After a final elimination round, Nadja Benaissa, Lucy Diakovska, Sandy Mölling, Vanessa Petruo and Jessica Wahls were chosen, and signed a recording contract with Polydor. Managed by Joy Berhanu during their first year, the girls were named &quot;No Angels&quot; following a public televoting and moved in together near Munich. With the final members of the group in place, the program followed the group during its recording sessions, photo and music video shoots and other promotional commitments such as showcases and instores. The show concluded with the band&#x27;s first public live performance at &quot;The Dome&quot; at the Dortmunder Westfalenhalle in February 2001.

===2001: Commercial breakthrough with &quot;Elle&#x27;ments&quot;===
After weeks of recording, No Angels released their debut single, &quot;Daylight in Your Eyes&quot; on 5 February 2001. The song instantly entered the top position on the Austrian, German and Swiss Singles and Airplay Charts, making it one of the most successful debuts of the year. Selling over one million copies, the song also proved to be a hit outside German-speaking Europe when it entered the singles charts of France, Latvia, Poland and the United Kingdom, and even became a number-one success in Brazil, and Estonia. Although an alternate version of the original music video was filmed for the North American market the following year, both the video and the song saw minor commercial success overseas. However, &quot;Daylight in Your Eyes&quot; peaked at number 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Singles Sales chart in June 2002.
The band released their debut album, &quot;Elle&#x27;ments&quot;. Involving production by German producers Thorsten Brötzmann, Leslie Mandoki, and Peter Ries, &quot;Elle&#x27;ments&quot; also entered the Austrian, German and Swiss Albums Chart at number-one. No Angels broke records for becoming the &quot;first act to ever debut at the top position in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland with both its debut single and debut album.&quot; The album would go on to sell more than one million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling German album of 2001. &quot;Elle&#x27;ments&quot; was eventually certified triple platinum and septuplicate gold by the IFPI, and earned the band several internationally acclaimed prizes such as a Bambi, two ECHO Awards and a World Music Award.

Riding a wave of publicity and hype, the group&#x27;s second single, &quot;Rivers of Joy&quot;, became a top ten hit, while third single, &quot;There Must Be an Angel&quot;, a cover version of the 1985 hit by British pop duo Eurythmics, continued the group&#x27;s high record sales by topping the charts once again in Austria and Germany. The last single released from &quot;Elle&#x27;ments&quot; was a double A-side of album cut &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot;, and &quot;Atlantis&quot;, a duet with the song&#x27;s original performer Donovan. The band had re-recorded the song for the closing credits of the Walt Disney Feature Animation picture &quot;&quot;. It became a top five entry in Germany, and was subsequently certified Gold. Following this and two encounters as the opening act for the German leg of both DJ Bobo and Westlife&#x27;s 2001 concert tours, No Angels embarked on their first own concert tour in October 2001. Compiling more than 30 dates, the tour concluded in December 2001 with all shows reportedly being sold out.

===2002: Career development on &quot;Now... Us!&quot;===
In June 2002, No Angels released their second album, &quot;Now... Us!&quot;, which featured co-writes by all members and received critical acclaim from many critics who believed the band would not last past their first album. The album debuted at number one on the German Album Chart and at number two and four on the Austrian and Swiss albums chart respectively, and was eventually certified platinum and double gold by the IFPI. Producers such as Mousse T. consulted on &quot;Now... Us!&quot;, whose media-critical leading single &quot;Something About Us&quot;, penned by band member Petruo, became the group&#x27;s third non-consecutive number-one hit in Austria and Germany within a period of 16 months.
Further singles released from the album included Latin pop ballad &quot;Still in Love with You&quot;, which reached the top five and was awarded a NRJ Music Award the following year, as well as Mousse T.-produced funk track &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;, the band&#x27;s first release to miss the German top ten.
Following an exclusive swing concert at the Berlin Tränenpalast in October, No Angels soon followed with a DVD and a live album, titled &quot;When the Angels Swing&quot;, featuring their biggest hits and selected songs from their first two albums, re-arranged by Grammy Award-nominated jazz musician Till Brönner. Critically acclaimed by critics, the album reached number nine of the German Albums Chart, eventually going gold. In November, the girls embarked on their second national concert tour, the &quot;Four Seasons Tour&quot;, playing sell-out shows in theatres across German-speaking Europe. Acts such as B3 and the Sugababes served as their support.

Soon after the girls experienced a bit of turbulence when Jessica Wahls announced she was taking a break from the band to give birth to her first child. Although the girls agreed on Jessica&#x27;s return the following year and Wahls was positive of a re-join after her daughter&#x27;s birth in March 2003, No Angels&#x27; management eventually decided on her departure in July 2003 as the group had equally successful went on as a quartet. While the singer accepted a recording contract as a solo artist with the group&#x27;s label, Sandy Mölling later noted Jessica&#x27;s pregnancy marked &quot;the beginning of the end of No Angels&quot;.

===2003–2004: &quot;Pure&quot; era and disbandment===
In early 2003, the remaining four members of No Angels began intensifying work on their third regular album. Encouraged to exercise more self-control on the longplayer, the band took over responsibility in recording and selecting songs to guarantee a more personal effort — a step that challenged criticism and growing scepticism among the band&#x27;s label Cheyenne Records and recording company Polydor. Titled &quot;Pure&quot;, the album was eventually released in August 2003 and became the band&#x27;s third number-one album in Germany. Sporting a more mature side of pop music, it earned them their best reactions yet, drawing comparisons to Madonna&#x27;s album &quot;Ray of Light&quot; (1998) as well as other female groups such as All Saints and the Sugababes. With a total of about 150,000 copies sold however, it failed to achieve the success of its two best-selling predecessors, still going gold. The pop rock-influenced leading single &quot;No Angel (It&#x27;s All in Your Mind)&quot; became the group&#x27;s fourth non-consecutive number-one single in Germany and seventh top ten hit in Austria, while mediterran &quot;Someday&quot; and R&amp;B-driven &quot;Feelgood Lies&quot; both reached the top five of the charts.

Further planned single releases off the album never materialised. On 7 September 2003, the quartet announced that they would not come together for a new No Angels project in 2004 due to lasting exhaustion and instead were preparing their official disbandment towards the end of the year. While the media began a never-ending speculation about the reasons for their split and the pro and contra of a &quot;creative pause&quot;, the girls and their management arranged the cancellation of all dates of their scheduled 2004 &quot;Pure Acoustic Tour&quot;. Even so, the band agreed on releasing a final album, &quot;The Best of No Angels&quot;, in December 2003. Apart from a collection of all singles, the band had released between the years of 2001 and 2003, the compilation album also contained a reworked version of one of the debut album tracks, &quot;Reason&quot;. Involving a re-joined Jessica Wahls, it was released as the band&#x27;s final single before their split and became another top ten success for the group. A charity single featuring the band&#x27;s vocals, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, was released simultaneously and reached number three on the German singles chart.

After a farewell concert in the Munich Olympiahalle on 28 November, several promotional television appearances, and a private unplugged performance in the Munich &quot;P1&quot; club on 12 December 2003, No Angels each went their separate ways, concentrating on their individual solo careers in music, theatre, television and film. A live compilation of their &quot;P1&quot; concert, titled &quot;Acoustic Angels&quot;, would become their final release on the Cheyenne label in July 2004.

===2006–2008: First reunion and Eurovision Song Contest===
In spring 2006, Lucy Diakovska reconnected with her former bandmates with the intention of reviving the group. While Vanessa Petruo rejected her offer to re-join the band in favour of her solo career in music and film, Benaissa, Mölling and Wahls agreed upon Diakovska&#x27;s request to reunite for a musical comeback, and the band eventually took action to prepare their next album in secrecy from public. While their former manager and &quot;Popstars&quot; producer Holger Roost-Macias offered to work with them again, the newly reunited quartet rejected his offer, and instead, they acquired the name rights that had remained with Roost-Macias and signed an artist contract with the Domestic Division of Universal Music Germany. In summer 2006, Benaissa, Diakovska, Mölling and Wahls appeared as guest judges on &quot;Popstars – Neue Engel braucht das Land&quot;, the fifth season of &quot;Popstars&quot;.
Following weeks of public rumors about a reunion of the band, an official press conference on 31 January 2007 announced that No Angels had reformed and were working on a new studio album with producers Boogieman, Tobias Gustafsson, Steve Mac, Adrian Newman, and the Redfly team. Although acclaimed and distinguished by the media, the reunion widely failed to link previous successes. The band&#x27;s first commercial release in years, &quot;Destiny&quot;, received a lukewarm reception from music critics, and debuted at number 4 in Germany, number 14 in Austria and number 22 in Switzerland, making it the band&#x27;s first regular studio album release neither to reach the top position on the German &quot;Media Control Charts&quot; nor the top ten in Austria and Switzerland respectively. It eventually sold 30,000 copies domestically during its run on the charts, also making it No Angels&#x27; lowest selling album to date. While the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Goodbye to Yesterday&quot; still made it to the top five, follow-up &quot;Maybe&quot; and double A-single &quot;Amaze Me&quot;/&quot;Teardrops&quot; became No Angels&#x27; lowest-charting singles to date, never making it to the top 20 of any chart. In March 2008, the album was re-released as &quot;Destiny Reloaded&quot;, including previously unreleased songs, remixes and B-sides. In fall 2007, No Angels produced the theme song, &quot;Life Is a Miracle&quot; and a music video for the Warner Bros. animated feature &quot;Little Dodo&quot;.

In January 2008, it was announced that the group had qualified for the Grand Prix Vorentscheid, the German national pre-selection of the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. Following several weeks of promotional appearances, No Angels entered the competition in March with Remee-and-Troelsen-produced &quot;Disappear&quot;, competing against all-male groups Marquess and Cinema Bizarre, and singers Tommy Reeve and Carolin Fortenbacher. Widely considered as early favourites by the media, the band eventually finished first, having earned tight 50,5% of the audience vote over Fortenbacher in the second and final election round. Released on 29 February 2008, &quot;Disappear&quot; reached number four in Germany, where it became the band&#x27;s biggest-selling single in years. With Germany being one of the biggest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union, No Angels were allowed to skip the contest&#x27;s semi-finals and automatically qualified for competition with 24 other countries in the finals of the ESC in May 2008. An estimated 100 million fans watched the final contest, and viewers from all 43 participating nations voted for their favourite performers via text message and telephone. No Angels eventually ranked 23rd place out of the 25 countries that participated with a total of 14 points – taking 12 points from Bulgaria, band member Lucy Diakovska&#x27;s native country, and 2 points from Switzerland only. Only the United Kingdom and Poland placed below the four-member female band.

=== 2009–2011: &quot;Welcome to the Dance&quot; ===
Devastated by their performance at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008, the band went into a hiatus. Having managed themselves since their reformation, they signed a deal with Khalid Schröder&#x27;s Kool Management in mid-2008, and started work on their fifth studio album &quot;Welcome to the Dance&quot;, involving a smaller team of North American musicians such as The Writing Camp, Adam Messinger, Nasri Atweh, Bill Blast, and Aaron Pearce. Taking the group&#x27;s work further into the dance and electronic genres, it was released on 11 September 2009, following several delays after band member Nadja Benaissa&#x27;s charge of grievous bodily harm and temporary imprisonment in April 2010. Released to generally mixed reviews by critics, the album debuted at number 26 in Germany where it became both the band&#x27;s lowest-charting and -selling album yet. &quot;Welcome to the Dance&quot;″s first and only single &quot;One Life&quot;, however, reached number 15 on the German Singles Chart. Plans for a second single, &quot;Derailed&quot;, were eventually scrapped for unknown reasons.

In May 2010, the band began their five-date acoustic An Intimate Evening With Tour in Munich, their first concert tour in eight years. The stripped-down club tour was inspired by their 2003 acoustic concert, and saw the band performing songs from all of their five studio albums. Benaissa did not take part in the tour as she had called in sick a week before, prompting the remaining trio to re-arrange their set at the last minute. Generally well received by the media, the tour was initially said to be extended in 2011. In September 2010, Benaissa announced her departure from the group following her two-year suspended sentence and 300 hours of community service a month before, leaving the band as a trio. While the remaining three members of the band were said to release a live album in 2011, this project and other plans announced for the tenth anniversary of the band failed to materialize in favor of individual solo projects. In 2014, Diakovska confirmed that the band had dissolved again with no new commercial projects planned.

=== 2020–2022: Second reunion and &quot;20&quot; ===
In late 2020, BMG Rights Management acquired the catalog of No Angels&#x27; former label Cheyenne Records. On 27 November 2020, following their absence from digital streaming platforms for five years, the band&#x27;s backup catalog from 2000 to 2004 was issued online, accompanied by a digital campaign as well as the release of high-quality versions of their original music videos. Released to strong streaming numbers, a revived interest from the media and their fan base prompted Benaissa, Diakovska, Mölling and Wahls to launch an official Instagram account through which they began sharing private photos and hosted several livestreams in the weeks following. With BMG interested in issuing updated versions of their early catalog, the quartet re-formed in January 2021 to record new vocals for a Celebration Version of &quot;Daylight in Your Eyes&quot; along with producer and manager Christian Geller. Commemorating with the 2001 release of the song, it was released on 12 February 2021 and reached the top ten of the German Download Chart.

Following their first performance in a decade on &quot;Schlagerchampions 2021&quot;, the quartet signed a new recording deal with BMG and began work on &quot;20&quot;, their first full-length album release since 2009, with plans to expand the anniversary celebrations. Released on 4 June 2021, No Angels recorded four original songs and sixteen updated versions of songs that were selected from their first three studio albums for &quot;20&quot;. Produced by Geller, the album received largely mixed reviews from critics, some of whom complimented the more cohesive, mature production, while others questioned the overall value of the project. &quot;20&quot; debuted at number one on the German Albums Chart, becoming No Angels&#x27; first chart topper in nearly two decades, and reached the top ten in Austria and Switzerland. A second single, the Celebration Version of &quot;Still in Love with You,&quot; was released the same month, followed by &quot;Mad Wild&quot; and &quot;When the Angels Sing&quot; in August and October, respectively. In June 2022, the band kicked off their Celebration Tour at the Kindl-Bühne Wuhlheide. Continued in September 2022, the tour compromised ten concerts throughout Germany and concluded on 8 October 2022.

=== 2023–present: Festival concerts and seventh studio album ===
In 2023, No Angels reunited for a few festival concerts and one-off events, including a special guest appearance on German hip hop group K.I.Z&#x27;s International Women&#x27;s Day concert at the Mercedes-Benz Arena. In January 2024, after winning the 17th season of the reality show &quot;Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!&quot;, Diakovska disclosed that the quartet was planning to record material for a new project in Berlin in summer 2024. In July 2024, she and Mölling respectively confirmed that the band was recording a new studio album set to be released in 2025. The recording process for this effort was finished on August 18, 2024, as the group took to Instagram. Wahls assumes a release in the latter half of 2025, as she stated during an Instagram livestream, but stressed that it is dependent on their record company&#x27;s schedules. This claim was further corroborated by Benaissa who talked about a bigger project the group had worked on for a release towards the end of 2025 during a taping of the &quot;NDR Talkshow&quot; in February of the same year.

<text>Patiala () is a city in southeastern Punjab, northwestern India. It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of Patiala district.

== Tourist attractions ==

===Kali Devi Mandir===

Kali Devi Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Maa Kaali. The temple was built by the Sikh ruler of the Patiala State, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh, who financed the building of the temple in his capital and oversaw its installation in 1936. Legend has it that the Maharaja built the temple to protect the city from flooding and performed annual sacrifice at the temple. Bhupinder Singh ruled the princely state of Patiala from 1900 to 1938. He brought the 6-ft statue of Divine Mother Kali and Paawan Jyoti from Bengal to Patiala and offered the first Bali (sacrifice) of a water buffalo to the temple. Because of the temple&#x27;s beautiful structure, it has been declared a national monument. This large complex attracts devotees, Hindu and Sikh, from distant places.

A much older temple of Raj Rajeshwari is also situated in the center of this complex. The temple is situated opposite the Baradari garden at Mall Road. Devotees offer mustard oil, daal (lentils), sweets, coconuts, bangles, and chunnis, goats, hens, and liquor to the Divine Mother here. As an average estimate, devotees offer more than 60,000 liquor bottles during Navratras alone, which are distributed to the beggars sitting outside the temple and go into a &#x27;Sharab Kund&#x27; built on the temple&#x27;s premises.

=== Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib ===
According to local tradition, supported by an old handwritten document preserved in the Gurdwara, one Bhag Ram, a Jhivar of Lehal, waited upon the ninth Guru of Sikhs Guru Tegh Bahadur during his sojourn at Saifabad (now Bahadurgarh). He requested that the Guru might be pleased to visit and bless his village so that its inhabitants could be rid of a severe and mysterious sickness that had been their bane for a long time.

The Guru visited Lehal on Magh sudi 5, 1728 Bikram/24 January 1672 and stayed under a banyan tree by the side of a pond. The sickness in the village subsided. The site where Guru Tegh Bahadur had sat came to be known as Dukh Nivaran, literally meaning eradicator of suffering. Devotees have faith in the healing qualities of water in the Sarovar attached to the shrine. It is still believed that any illness can be cured by &#x27;ishnaan&#x27; on five consecutive Panchami. It is in the vicinity of Patiala Bus Station.

=== Gurdwara Moti Bagh ===

Gurudwara Moti Baag is situated on the outskirts of Patiala City. When Shri Guru Teg Bahadur started his journey towards Delhi, he came here via Kiratpur Sahib, Bharatgarh Sahib, Roap Makar, Kabulpur, etc. Saint Saif Ali Khan was a great follower of Guru, To fulfill his wish Guru Sahib came to his Place Saifabad (Bahadur Garh). The holly Guru stayed here for 3 Months. Saif Ali Khan Served the Guru with great devotion. In the daytime Guru Teg Bahadur used to meditate on the Place inside the Qila (Fort) and at night time, he would come here. From here the Guru left for Samana and stayed in the Haveli of Muhamad Bakhshish. From there onward, Guru Sahib left towards Cheeka Via Karhali, Balbera.

=== Bahadurgarh Fort ===
The Bahadurgarh Fort is 6 kilometers away from Patiala city. It is situated on Patiala-Chandigarh road. The fort was constructed by Mughal Nawab Saif Khan in 1658 A.D. where Guru Teg Bahadur visited him and later renovated by a Sikh ruler Maharaja Karam Singh in 1837. The construction of the entire fort was completed in eight years. A sum of ten lakh rupees was spent on its construction. It covers an area of . The fort is enclosed within two rounded walls and a moat. The circumference of the fort is slightly over two kilometers.

The name Bahadurgarh fort was given by Maharaja Karam Singh as a tribute to the Sikh Guru Teg Bahadur who stayed here for three months and nine days before leaving for Delhi where he was executed by Aurangzeb in 1675 CE. The fort consists of a historical Gurdwara Sahib (a Sikh temple) named Gurdwara Sahib Patshai Nauvin. This Gurudwara shows fine Sikh architecture. This Gurudwara is controlled by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee. People visit this Gurudwara on the occasion of the festival of Baisakhi on 13 April, every year.

=== Qila Mubarak complex ===

The Qila Mubarak complex stands on a 10-acre ground in the heart of the city and contains the main palace or Qila Androon (literally, &#x27;inner fort&#x27;), the guesthouse or Ran Baas and the Darbar Hall. Outside the Qila are the Darshani Gate, a Shiva temple, and bazaar shops which border the streets that run around the Qila and sell precious ornaments, colourful hand-woven fabrics, &#x27;jootis&#x27; and bright &#x27;Paradis&#x27;.

It was the principal residence of the Patiala royals until the construction of Old Moti Bagh Palace.

The entrance is through an imposing gate. The architectural style of the palace is a synthesis of late Mughal and Rajasthani. The complex has ten courtyards along the north–south axis. Each courtyard is unique in size and character, some being broad, others very small and others mere slits in the fabric of the building. Though the Androon is a single interconnected building, it is spoken of as a series of palaces. Each set of rooms makes a cluster around a courtyard, and each carries a name: Topkhana, Qila Mubarak, Sheesh Mahal, Treasury, and Prison. Ten of the rooms are painted with frescoes or decorated intricately with mirrors and gilt.

In a tiny portion of the complex is a little British construction with Gothic arches, fireplaces made of marble, and built-in toilets perched on the Mughal Rajasthani roof. Burj Baba Ala Singh has had a fire smouldering ever since the time of Ala Singh, along with a flame brought by him from Jwalaji. Every year it is decorated beautifully for the Heritage Festival.

=== Sheesh Mahal ===
A part of the Old Moti Bagh Palace built in the 19th century by the Maharajas is the famous Sheesh Mahal, literally meaning the Palace of Mirrors. The mahal contains a large number of frescoes, most of which were made under His Highness Maharaja Narinder Singh. A lake in front of the palace adds to the beauty. Lakshman Jhula, a bridge built across the lake, is a famous attraction. A museum housing the largest collection of medals from the world collected by His Highness Maharaja Bhupinder Singh is here.

Currently, the museum along with the main building is closed for public viewing because of renovation. However, tourists can access the surroundings of the Mahal along with the Lakshman Jhula.

=== Baradari Gardens ===

The Baradari Gardens, the garden with 12 gates, are in the north of old Patiala city, just outside Sheranwala Gate. The garden complex, set up during the reign of Maharaja Rajindera Singh, has extensive vegetation of rare trees, shrubs, and flowers dotted with impressive Colonial buildings and a marble statue of Maharaja Rajindera Singh.

Patiala was the first town in this part of the country to have a degree college – the Mohindra College – in 1870.

Patiala has seen the evolution of a distinct style of architecture. Borrowing from the Rajput style, its beauty and elegance are molded according to the local traditions.

With the active patronage of the Maharajas of Patiala, a well-established style of Hindustan I music called the &quot;Patiala gharana&quot; came into existence and has held its own up to the present times. This school of music has had several famous musicians, many of whom came to Patiala after the disintegration of the Mughal Court at Delhi in the 18th century. At the turn of the century, Ustad Ali Bux was the most renowned exponent of this Gharana. Later, his sons Ustad Akhtar Hussain Khan and Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan achieved worldwide fame and brought glory to the Patiala Gharana.

After the partition of British India, the Muslim community was massacred or forced to flee the city en masse to Pakistan. At the same time, many Hindu and Sikh refugees migrated from Pakistan and settled on the Muslim properties in Patiala. The then Maharaja of Patiala, His Highness Yadavindra Singh, Rajpramukh of PEPSU with his wife Her Highness Maharani Mohinder Kaur organized a large number of camps and worked tirelessly for the people.

<text>Gastropods (), commonly known as slugs and snails, belong to a large taxonomic class of invertebrates within the phylum Mollusca called Gastropoda ().

This class comprises snails and slugs from saltwater, freshwater, and from the land. There are many thousands of species of sea snails and slugs, as well as freshwater snails, freshwater limpets, land snails and slugs.

The class Gastropoda is a diverse and highly successful class of mollusks within the phylum Mollusca. It contains a vast total of named species, second only to the insects in overall number. The fossil history of this class goes back to the Late Cambrian. , 721 families of gastropods are known, of which 245 are extinct and appear only in the fossil record, while 476 are currently extant with or without a fossil record.

Gastropoda (previously known as univalves and sometimes spelled &quot;Gasteropoda&quot;) are a major part of the phylum Mollusca, and are the most highly diversified class in the phylum, with 65,000 to 80,000 living snail and slug species. The anatomy, behavior, feeding, and reproductive adaptations of gastropods vary significantly from one clade or group to another, so stating many generalities for all gastropods is difficult.

The class Gastropoda has an extraordinary diversification of habitats. Representatives live in gardens, woodland, deserts, and on mountains; in small ditches, great rivers, and lakes; in estuaries, mudflats, the rocky intertidal, the sandy subtidal, the abyssal depths of the oceans, including the hydrothermal vents, and numerous other ecological niches, including parasitic ones.

Although the name &quot;snail&quot; can be, and often is, applied to all the members of this class, commonly this word means only those species with an external shell big enough that the soft parts can withdraw completely into it. Slugs are gastropods that have no shell or a very small, internal shell; semislugs are gastropods that have a shell that they can partially retreat into but not entirely.

The marine shelled species of gastropods include species such as abalone, conches, periwinkles, whelks, and numerous other sea snails that produce seashells that are coiled in the adult stage—though in some, the coiling may not be very visible, for example in cowries. In a number of families of species, such as all the various limpets, the shell is coiled only in the larval stage, and is a simple conical structure after that.

==Etymology==
In the scientific literature, gastropods were described as &quot;gasteropodes&quot; by in 1795. The word &quot;gastropod&quot; comes from Greek ( &#x27;stomach&#x27;) and ( &#x27;foot&#x27;), a reference to the fact that the animal&#x27;s &quot;foot&quot; is positioned below its guts.

The earlier name &quot;univalve&quot; means one valve (or shell), in contrast to bivalves, such as clams, which have two valves or shells.

== Diversity ==
At all taxonomic levels, gastropods are second only to insects in terms of their diversity.

Gastropods have the greatest numbers of named mollusk species. However, estimates of the total number of gastropod species vary widely, depending on cited sources. The number of gastropod species can be ascertained from estimates of the number of described species of Mollusca with accepted names: about 85,000 (minimum 50,000, maximum 120,000). But an estimate of the total number of Mollusca, including undescribed species, is about 240,000 species. The estimate of 85,000 mollusks includes 24,000 described species of terrestrial gastropods.

Different estimates for aquatic gastropods (based on different sources) give about 30,000 species of marine gastropods, and about 5,000 species of freshwater and brackish gastropods. Many deep-sea species remain to be discovered, as only 0.0001% of the deep-sea floor has been studied biologically. The total number of living species of freshwater snails is about 4,000.

Recently extinct species of gastropods (extinct since 1500) number 444, 18 species are now extinct in the wild (but still exist in captivity), and 69 species are &quot;possibly extinct&quot;.

The number of prehistoric (fossil) species of gastropods is at least 15,000 species.

In marine habitats, the continental slope and the continental rise are home to the highest diversity, while the continental shelf and abyssal depths have a low diversity of marine gastropods.

== Habitat ==
Gastropods are found in a wide range of aquatic and terrestrial habitats, from deep ocean trenches to deserts.

Some of the more familiar and better-known gastropods are terrestrial gastropods (the land snails and slugs). Some live in fresh water, but most named species of gastropods live in a marine environment. 

Gastropods have a worldwide distribution, from the near Arctic and Antarctic zones to the tropics. They have become adapted to almost every kind of existence on earth, having colonized nearly every available medium.

In habitats where not enough calcium carbonate is available to build a really solid shell, such as on some acidic soils on land, various species of slugs occur, and also some snails with thin, translucent shells, mostly or entirely composed of the protein conchiolin.

Snails such as &quot;Sphincterochila boissieri&quot; and &quot;Xerocrassa seetzeni&quot; have adapted to desert conditions. Other snails have adapted to an existence in ditches, near deepwater hydrothermal vents, in oceanic trenches 10,000 meters (6 miles) below the surface, the pounding surf of rocky shores, caves, and many other diverse areas.

Gastropods can be accidentally transferred from one habitat to another by other animals, e.g. by birds.

== Anatomy ==
Snails are distinguished by an anatomical process known as torsion, where the visceral mass of the animal rotates 180° to one side during development, such that the anus is situated more or less above the head. This process is unrelated to the coiling of the shell, which is a separate phenomenon. Torsion is present in all gastropods, but the opisthobranch gastropods are secondarily untorted to various degrees.

Torsion occurs in two stages. The first, mechanistic stage is muscular, and the second is mutagenetic. The effects of torsion are primarily physiological. The organism develops by asymmetrical growth, with the majority of growth occurring on the left side. This leads to the loss of right-side anatomy that in most bilaterians is a duplicate of the left side anatomy. The essential feature of this asymmetry is that the anus generally lies to one side of the median plane. The gill-combs, the olfactory organs, the foot slime-gland, nephridia, and the auricle of the heart are single or at least are more developed on one side of the body than the other. Furthermore, there is only one genital orifice, which lies on the same side of the body as the anus. Furthermore, the anus becomes redirected to the same space as the head. This is speculated to have some evolutionary function, as prior to torsion, when retracting into the shell, first the posterior end would get pulled in, and then the anterior. Now, the front can be retracted more easily, perhaps suggesting a defensive purpose.

Gastropods typically have a well-defined head with two or four sensory tentacles with eyes, and a ventral foot. The foremost division of the foot is called the propodium. Its function is to push away sediment as the snail crawls. The larval shell of a gastropod is called a protoconch.

=== Shell ===


Most shelled gastropods have a one piece shell (with exceptional bivalved gastropods), typically coiled or spiraled, at least in the larval stage. This coiled shell usually opens on the right-hand side (as viewed with the shell apex pointing upward). Numerous species have an operculum, which in many species acts as a trapdoor to close the shell. This is usually made of a horn-like material, but in some molluscs it is calcareous. In the land slugs, the shell is reduced or absent, and the body is streamlined.

Some gastropods have adult shells which are bottom heavy due to the presence of a thick, often broad, convex ventral callus deposit on the inner lip and adapical to the aperture which may be important for gravitational stability.

=== Body wall ===
Some sea slugs are very brightly colored. This serves either as a warning, when they are poisonous or contain stinging cells, or to camouflage them on the brightly colored hydroids, sponges, and seaweeds on which many of the species are found.

Lateral outgrowths on the body of nudibranchs are called cerata. These contain an outpocketing of digestive glands called the diverticula.

=== Sensory organs and nervous system ===

The sensory organs of gastropods include olfactory organs, eyes, statocysts and mechanoreceptors. Gastropods have no hearing.

In terrestrial gastropods (land snails and slugs), the olfactory organs, located on the tips of the four tentacles, are the most important sensory organ. The chemosensory organs of opisthobranch marine gastropods are called rhinophores.

The majority of gastropods have simple visual organs, eye spots either at the tip or base of the tentacles. However, &quot;eyes&quot; in gastropods range from simple ocelli that only distinguish light and dark, to more complex pit eyes, and even to lens eyes. In land snails and slugs, vision is not the most important sense, because they are mainly nocturnal animals.

The nervous system of gastropods includes the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. The central nervous system consists of ganglia connected by nerve cells. It includes paired ganglia: the cerebral ganglia, pedal ganglia, osphradial ganglia, pleural ganglia, parietal ganglia and the visceral ganglia. There are sometimes also buccal ganglia.

=== Digestive system ===

The radula of a gastropod is usually adapted to the food that a species eats. The simplest gastropods are the limpets and abalone, herbivores that use their hard radula to rasp at seaweeds on rocks.

Many marine gastropods are burrowers, and have a siphon that extends out from the mantle edge. Sometimes the shell has a siphonal canal to accommodate this structure. A siphon enables the animal to draw water into their mantle cavity and over the gill. They use the siphon primarily to &quot;taste&quot; the water to detect prey from a distance. Gastropods with siphons tend to be either predators or scavengers.

=== Respiratory system ===

Almost all marine gastropods breathe with a gill, but many freshwater species, and the majority of terrestrial species, have a pallial lung. The respiratory protein in almost all gastropods is hemocyanin, but one freshwater pulmonate family, the Planorbidae, have hemoglobin as the respiratory protein.

In one large group of sea slugs, the gills are arranged as a rosette of feathery plumes on their backs, which gives rise to their other name, nudibranchs. Some nudibranchs have smooth or warty backs with no visible gill mechanism, such that respiration may likely take place directly through the skin.

=== Circulatory system ===

Gastropods have open circulatory system and the transport fluid is hemolymph. Hemocyanin is present in the hemolymph as the respiratory pigment.

===Excretory system===

The primary organs of excretion in gastropods are nephridia, which produce either ammonia or uric acid as a waste product. The nephridium also plays an important role in maintaining water balance in freshwater and terrestrial species. Additional organs of excretion, at least in some species, include pericardial glands in the body cavity, and digestive glands opening into the stomach.

=== Reproductive system ===
Courtship is a part of mating behavior in some gastropods, including some of the Helicidae. Again, in some land snails, an unusual feature of the reproductive system of gastropods is the presence and utilization of love darts.

In many marine gastropods other than the opisthobranchs, there are separate sexes (dioecious/gonochoric); most land gastropods, however, are hermaphrodites.

==Life cycle==


Courtship is a part of the behavior of mating gastropods with some pulmonate families of land snails creating and utilizing love darts, the throwing of which have been identified as a form of sexual selection.

The main aspects of the life cycle of gastropods include:
* Egg laying and the eggs of gastropods
* The embryonic development of gastropods
* The larvae or larval stadium: some gastropods may be trochophore and/or veliger
* Estivation and hibernation (each of these are present in some gastropods only)
* The growth of gastropods
* Courtship and mating in gastropods: fertilization is internal or external according to the species. External fertilization is common in marine gastropods.

== Feeding behavior ==

The diet of gastropods differs according to the group considered. Marine gastropods include some that are herbivores, detritus feeders, predatory carnivores, scavengers, parasites, and also a few ciliary feeders, in which the radula is reduced or absent. Land-dwelling species can chew up leaves, bark, fruit, fungi, and decomposing animals while marine species can scrape algae off the rocks on the seafloor. Certain species such as the Archaeogastropoda maintain horizontal rows of slender marginal teeth. In some species that have evolved into endoparasites, such as the eulimid &quot;Thyonicola doglieli&quot;, many of the standard gastropod features are strongly reduced or absent.

A few sea slugs are herbivores and some are carnivores. The carnivorous habit is due to specialisation. Many gastropods have distinct dietary preferences and regularly occur in close association with their food species.

Some predatory carnivorous gastropods include: cone shells, &quot;Testacella&quot;, &quot;Daudebardia&quot;, turrids, ghost slugs and others.

===Terrestrial gastropods===
Studies based on direct observations, fecal and gut analyses, as well as food-choice experiments, have revealed that snails and slugs consume a wide variety of food resources. Their diet spans from living plants at various developmental stages such as pollen, seeds, seedlings, and wood, to decaying plant material like leaf litter. Additionally, they feed on fungi, lichens, algae, soil, and even other animals, both living and dead, including their feces. Given this diverse diet, terrestrial gastropods can be classified as herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, and detritivores. However, the majority are microbivores, primarily consuming microbes associated with decaying organic material. Despite their ecological importance, there is a notable lack of research exploring the specific roles that terrestrial gastropods play within soil food webs.

====Fungivory====

Many terrestrial gastropod mollusks are known to consume fungi, a behavior observed in various species of snails and slugs across distinct families. Notable examples of fungivore slugs include members of the family Philomycidae, which feed on slime molds (myxomycetes), and the Ariolimacidae, which primarily consume mushrooms (basidiomycetes). Snail families that contain fungivore species include Clausiliidae, Macrocyclidae, and Polygyridae.

Mushroom-producing fungi used as a food source by snails and slugs include species from several genera. Some examples are milk-caps (&quot;Lactarius&quot; spp.), the oyster mushroom (&quot;Pleurotus ostreatus&quot;), and the penny bun. Additionally, slugs feed on fungi from other genera, such as &quot;Agaricus&quot;, &quot;Pleurocybella&quot;, and &quot;Russula&quot;. Snails have also been reported to feed on penny buns as well as &quot;Coprinellus&quot;, &quot;Aleurodiscus&quot;, &quot;Armillaria&quot;, &quot;Grifola &quot;, &quot;Marasmiellus&quot;, &quot;Mycena&quot;, &quot;Pholiota&quot;, and &quot;Ramaria&quot;. As for slime molds, commonly consumed species include &quot;Stemonitis axifera&quot; and &quot;Symphytocarpus flaccidus&quot;.

Feeding behaviors in slugs exhibit considerable variation. Some species display selectivity, consuming specific parts or developmental stages of fungi. For instance, certain slugs may target fungi only at particular stages of maturity, such as immature fruiting bodies or spore-producing structures. Conversely, other species show little to no selectivity, consuming entire mushrooms regardless of developmental stage. This variability stresses the diverse dietary adaptations among slug species and their ecological roles in fungal consumption. Moreover, by consuming fungi, snails and slugs can also indirectly help in their dispersal by carrying along some of their spores or the fungi themselves.

== Genetics ==
Gastropods exhibit an important degree of variation in mitochondrial gene organization when compared to other animals. Main events of gene rearrangement occurred at the origin of Patellogastropoda and Heterobranchia, whereas fewer changes occurred between the ancestors of Vetigastropoda (only tRNAs D, C and N) and Caenogastropoda (a large single inversion, and translocations of the tRNAs D and N). Within Heterobranchia, gene order seems relatively conserved, and gene rearrangements are mostly related with transposition of tRNA genes.

== Geological history and evolution ==


The first gastropods were exclusively marine, with the earliest known representatives appearing in the Late Cambrian (e.g., &quot;Chippewaella&quot;, &quot;Strepsodiscus&quot;). However, their only definitive gastropod feature is a coiled shell, which raises the possibility that they may belong to the stem lineage of gastropods, or might not be gastropods at all. Early Cambrian species such as &quot;Helcionella&quot;, &quot;Barskovia&quot;, and &quot;Scenella&quot; are no longer considered gastropods, and the small coiled &quot;Aldanella&quot; from the same period is probably not even a mollusk.

It is not until the Ordovician that true crown-group gastropods appear. By this time, gastropods had diversified into a variety of forms and inhabited a range of aquatic environments. Fossil gastropods from the early Paleozoic are often poorly preserved, making identification difficult. However, the Silurian genus &quot;Poleumita&quot; contains at least 15 identified species. Overall, gastropods were less common in the Paleozoic than bivalves.

Most Paleozoic gastropods belong to primitive groups, some of which still exist today. By the Carboniferous period, many gastropod shell shapes found in fossils resemble those of modern species, though most of these early forms are not directly related to living gastropods. It was during the Mesozoic era that the ancestors of many extant gastropods evolved. One of the earliest known terrestrial gastropods is &quot;Anthracopupa&quot; (or &quot;Maturipupa&quot;), found in the Carboniferous Coal Measures of Europe. However, land snails and their relatives were rare before the Cretaceous period.

In Mesozoic rocks, gastropods become more common in the fossil record, with well-preserved shells. Fossils are found in ancient beds from both freshwater and marine environments. Notable examples include the Purbeck Marble of the Jurassic and the Sussex Marble of the early Cretaceous, both from southern England. These limestones contain abundant remains of the pond snail &quot;Viviparus&quot;. Cenozoic rocks yield vast numbers of gastropod fossils, many of which are closely related to modern species. The diversity of gastropods increased significantly at the start of this era, alongside that of bivalves.

Certain trail-like markings preserved in ancient sedimentary rocks are thought to have been made by gastropods crawling over the soft mud and sand. Although these trace fossils are of debatable origin, some of them do resemble the trails made by living gastropods today.

Gastropod fossils may sometimes be confused with ammonites or other shelled cephalopods. An example of this is &quot;Bellerophon&quot; from the limestones of the Carboniferous period in Europe, the shell of which is planispirally coiled and can be mistaken for the shell of a cephalopod.

Gastropods also provide important evidence of faunal changes during the Pleistocene epoch, reflecting the impacts of advancing and retreating ice sheets.

===Phylogeny===
A cladogram showing the phylogenic relationships of Gastropoda with example species:

Cocculiniformia, Neomphalina and Lower Heterobranchia are not included in the above cladogram.

== Taxonomy ==
=== Current classification ===
The present backbone classification of gastropods relies on the results of phylogenomic analyses. Consensus has not been reached yet considering the relationships at the very base of the gastropod tree of life, but otherwise the major groups are known with confidence.

* Gastropoda
** Adenogonogastropoda (Angiogastropoda)
*** Apogastropoda
**** Caenogastropoda
**** Heterobranchia
*** Neritimorpha
** Patellogastropoda
** Vetigastropoda (including Neomphaliones)

=== History ===
Since Darwin, biological taxonomy has attempted to reflect the phylogeny of organisms, i.e., the tree of life. The classifications used in taxonomy attempt to represent the precise interrelatedness of the various taxa. However, the taxonomy of the Gastropoda is constantly being revised and so the versions shown in various texts can differ in major ways.

In the older classification of the gastropods, there were four subclasses:
* Opisthobranchia (gills to the right and behind the heart).
* Gymnomorpha (no shell)
* Prosobranchia (gills in front of the heart).
* Pulmonata (with a lung instead of gills)

The taxonomy of the Gastropoda is still under revision, and more and more of the old taxonomy is being abandoned, as the results of DNA studies slowly become clearer. Nevertheless, a few of the older terms such as &quot;opisthobranch&quot; and &quot;prosobranch&quot; are still sometimes used in a descriptive way.

New insights based on DNA sequencing of gastropods have produced some revolutionary new taxonomic insights. In the case of the Gastropoda, the taxonomy is now gradually being rewritten to embody strictly monophyletic groups (only one lineage of gastropods in each group). Integrating new findings into a working taxonomy remain challenging. Consistent ranks within the taxonomy at the level of subclass, superorder, order, and suborder have already been abandoned as unworkable. Ongoing revisions of the higher taxonomic levels are expected in the near future.

Convergent evolution, which appears to exist at especially high frequency in gastropods, may account for the observed differences between the older phylogenies, which were based on morphological data, and more recent gene-sequencing studies.

In 2004, Brian Simison and David R. Lindberg showed possible diphyletic origins of the Gastropoda based on mitochondrial gene order and amino acid sequence analyses of complete genes.

In 2005, Philippe Bouchet and Jean-Pierre Rocroi made sweeping changes in the systematics, resulting in the Bouchet &amp; Rocroi taxonomy, which is a step closer to the evolutionary history of the phylum. The Bouchet &amp; Rocroi classification system is based partly on the older systems of classification, and partly on new cladistic research. In the past, the taxonomy of gastropods was largely based on phenetic morphological characters of the taxa. The recent advances are more based on molecular characters from DNA and RNA research. This has made the taxonomical ranks and their hierarchy controversial.

In 2017, Bouchet, Rocroi, and other collaborators published a significantly updated version of the 2005 taxonomy. In the Bouchet et al. taxonomy, the authors used unranked clades for taxa above the rank of superfamily (replacing the ranks suborder, order, superorder and subclass), while using the traditional Linnaean approach for all taxa below the rank of superfamily. Whenever monophyly has not been tested, or is known to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic, the term &quot;group&quot; or &quot;informal group&quot; has been used. The classification of families into subfamilies is often not well resolved.

Fixed ranks like family, genus, and species however remain useful for practical classification and remain used in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Also many researchers continue to use traditional ranks because they are entrenched in the literature and familiar to specialists and non-specialists alike.

==Ecology and conservation==
Many gastropod species face threats from habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. Some species are endangered or have become extinct due to these factors. Conservation efforts often focus on protecting their habitats, especially in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems.

===Predators===
Gastropods are prey to a wide range of organisms depending on the environment. In marine habitats, gastropods are preyed upon by fish, marine birds, marine mammals, crustaceans, and other mollusks such as cephalopods. In terrestrial environments, gastropod predators include insects, arachnids (spiders, harvestmen), birds, and mammals, among others.

<text>Stuart Fitzrandolph Merrill (August 1, 1863 in Hempstead, New York – December 1, 1915 in Versailles, France) was an American poet, who wrote mostly in the French language. He belonged to the Symbolist school. His principal books of poetry were &quot;Les Gammes&quot; (1887), &quot;Les Fastes&quot; (1891), and &quot;Petits Poèmes d&#x27;Automne&quot; (1895).
==Life==
Merrill was the product of a conservative, wealthy, Protestant upbringing. In 1866, his father George received a diplomatic appointment to Paris, where Merrill would learn French and live for the next 19 years. Stéphane Mallarmé was one of Merrill&#x27;s school instructors. His classmates included future symbolists René Ghil and Pierre Quillard. Merrill ran a weekly journal, &quot;Le fou&quot;, before returning to the States in 1884 to attend law school. On April 15, 1887, he went to Madison Square Theater in New York to hear Walt Whitman give his famous &quot;Death of Abraham Lincoln&quot; lecture. Afterwards, he had the opportunity to meet Whitman, an experience he later recorded in the magazine &quot;Le Masque.&quot;

Also in 1887, Merrill published his first book of poems, &quot;Les gammes&quot;, in Paris, receiving wide critical acclaim in Europe. As his literary career took off he participated in radical political causes, siding with the anarchists in the famous Haymarket riots. When George Bernard Shaw attempted to circulate a petition in London calling for the release of Oscar Wilde, imprisoned for homosexuality, Merrill made a similar attempt to get notable artists and intellectuals in the United States to voice support for Wilde. Merrill&#x27;s father disinherited him for his politics, but his mother continued to support him financially throughout his life.

In 1890, Merrill published &quot;Pastels in Prose&quot;, a collection of his translations of French prose poems. This was his only book to be published in America during his lifetime. The same year, he returned to Europe permanently. He married in 1891. For the years 1893–1908, his address was 53 Quai de Bourbon, Île Saint-Louis, Paris. Several more books, including &quot;Les fastes&quot; in 1891 and &quot;Petits poèmes d’automne&quot; in 1895, were published before his death of heart disease in 1915. In 1927 a small traffic way in the 17th arrondissement of Paris took the name Place Stuart-Merrill.

<text>Woodstock &#x27;94 was an American music festival held in 1994 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original Woodstock festival of 1969. It was promoted as &quot;2 More Days of Peace and Music&quot;. The poster used to promote the first concert was revised to feature two catbirds perched on the neck of an electric guitar, instead of the original one catbird on an acoustic guitar.

The 1994 concert was scheduled for the weekend of August 13–14, with a third day (Friday, August 12) added later. Tickets to the festival cost $135 each. The weather was hot and dry on Friday but by early Saturday afternoon storms rolled in. The rains turned much of the field into mud.

The event took place on Winston Farm, just west of Saugerties, New York-about north of New York City and northeast of the original 1969 festival site near Bethel, which had 12,000 on hand to celebrate the silver anniversary.

Though only 164,000 tickets were sold, the crowd at Woodstock &#x27;94 was estimated at 350,000. The size of the crowd was larger than concert organizers had planned for and by the second night many of the event policies were logistically unenforceable. The major issues related to security, when attendees arrived, left or returned to the site, and the official concert food and beverage vendor policy which initially restricted attendees from entering with supplies of food, drinks, and above all alcohol. With the concert site mostly enclosed by simple chain link fences, there was hardly any difficulty for many attendees to enter freely with beer and other banned items. The security staff, along with the entrance and exit staff, could not continue reasonable monitoring of the increasing number of people entering and exiting while at the same time maintaining safety, security, and a peaceful atmosphere.

Three deaths at the festival were confirmed. An unidentified 45-year-old male died on Saturday of suspected diabetes complications. On Sunday, a 20-year-old died of a ruptured spleen. Organizers also confirmed 5,000 were treated at medical tents and 800 were taken to hospitals.

The festival was followed by Woodstock &#x27;99, also in New York at Rome.

*Blind Melon frontman Shannon Hoon took the stage in his girlfriend&#x27;s dress and appeared to be tripping on acid during the band&#x27;s performance and post-show interview with MTV.
*Nine Inch Nails had the largest crowd density at the event, overshadowing many of the other performers. Just before going on stage, they wrestled each other in the mud and went on to perform completely wet and covered in mud. In the post-performance interview, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor claimed he thought his band&#x27;s performance was &quot;terrible&quot; due to technical difficulties on stage. Reznor admitted that while he disliked playing at such a large show, it was done for the money: &quot;To be quite frank, it&#x27;s basically to offset the cost of the tour we&#x27;re doing right now.&quot; Their performance of &quot;Happiness in Slavery&quot; at the festival won the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1996.
*Aerosmith&#x27;s Joey Kramer, Joe Perry, and Steven Tyler were all attendees at the original Woodstock festival in 1969. Aerosmith performed around 3 to 4 a.m., right after an extensive fireworks display from Metallica. Tyler said on the liner notes for the album during their set: &quot;It rained like a cow pissing on a flat rock&quot;.
*During Primus&#x27; performance of the song &quot;My Name Is Mud&quot;, the audience responded by pelting the band with mud, which singer and bassist Les Claypool ended by telling the crowd that &quot;when you throw things on stage, it&#x27;s a sign of small and insignificant genitalia&quot;. Twenty years after the show, Claypool claimed to still have some of the mud stuck in the bass cabinets he used at the event. Another memorable moment from Primus&#x27; set at Woodstock &#x27;94 was when Jerry Cantrell, the guitarist and vocalist of Alice in Chains, joined Primus onstage during their performance of the song &quot;Harold of the Rocks&quot;.

===Notable Events: Day 3===
*Woodstock &#x27;94 has also been referred to as &quot;Mudstock&quot; or &quot;Mudstock &#x27;94&quot;, partly due to the rainy weather that resulted in mud pits and the aforementioned performances of Nine Inch Nails and Primus. This culminated with Green Day&#x27;s performance, during which guitarist and lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong started a mudfight with the crowd during their song &quot;Paper Lanterns&quot;. In the documentary &quot;VH1 Behind the Music: Green Day&quot;, bassist Mike Dirnt was mistaken for one of the fans jumping on stage and was spear-tackled by a security guard, knocking out one of his teeth. It was this incident that caused Dirnt to need emergency orthodontia. A gag order was put in place regarding this incident. Due to the now-infamous mudfight and Dirnt&#x27;s injury, Woodstock quickly propelled Green Day&#x27;s then recently released album &quot;Dookie&quot; into success.
*After being injured in a traffic accident in 1966 and his subsequent disappearance from the popular music scene, Bob Dylan declined to go to the original Woodstock Festival of 1969, even though he lived in the area at the time. He set off for the Isle of Wight Festival the day the Woodstock festival started and performed at Woodside Bay on August 31, 1969. Dylan, however, did accept an invitation to perform at Woodstock &#x27;94 and was introduced with the phrase: &quot;We waited twenty-five years to hear this. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Dylan&quot;. Although he was an hour and a half late to his performance, his set was considered one of the greater moments of the festival by various critics and represented the beginning of another new phase in his lengthy career. Uncharacteristically for the time, Dylan played lead guitar in a more rock-oriented electric set.
*The Red Hot Chili Peppers performed in lightbulb costumes for the first song of their set. Later in the set they would all dress up as Jimi Hendrix had at the original Woodstock. The lightbulb costumes are now on display at the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.
*Peter Gabriel headlined the North Stage on the last night and closed Woodstock &#x27;94.

===Other notes on performers===
*Several of the artists including Green Day and Cypress Hill skipped at least one Lollapalooza tour date in order to appear at Woodstock &#x27;94.
*Performers from the original Woodstock appearing at Woodstock &#x27;94 were the Band, Santana, Joe Cocker, Country Joe McDonald, John Sebastian, the surviving members of Sweetwater, and Crosby, Stills, &amp; Nash. Additionally, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane/Hot Tuna and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, all Woodstock alumni, also appeared, performing with the Band on guitar, bass, and guitar and vocals, respectively.
*Six local unsigned bands performed at Woodstock &#x27;94, including Futu Futu and Lunch Meat of Saugerties, and Straight Wired of Westchester County.

===Declined invitations or missed connections===
*Guns N&#x27; Roses were asked to appear at the festival but the band declined due to internal problems, as well as feeling the concert was too &quot;commercial.&quot; However, lead guitarist Slash made an appearance with Paul Rodgers.
*Johnny Cash (the only living person at that time to be inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame) was also invited to perform on the last day of Woodstock &#x27;94, but declined after learning that he would not be performing on the main stage.
*Alice in Chains were on the festival’s initial bill. However, the band pulled out due to lead singer Layne Staley&#x27;s continuing drug problems.
*Todd Rundgren had a multimedia performance in the festival&#x27;s &quot;Surreal Field&quot; several times during the course of the entire festival.
*Promoters pursued Nirvana to perform at the festival. At the time, the band pulled out of Lollapalooza due to singer Kurt Cobain&#x27;s health. By the time the festival was set to take place, Cobain&#x27;s death and the disbanding of Nirvana made a performance impractical.

==Broadcast and recordings==
The Woodstock &#x27;94 festival was shot using the early analog HD 1125-line Hi-Vision system in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The footage would be used for later home packages and a planned theatrical documentary about the event. The HD footage was mixed live into standard definition 4:3 NTSC for cable TV broadcast.

The Woodstock &#x27;94 festival was broadcast live on MTV via pay-per-view in the U.S. and Canada. In the UK, audio from the event was broadcast on BBC Radio 1.

===Commercial releases===
Highlights from the concert were later released as a double album set on November 4, 1994 on CD and cassette. The film about the event, directed by Bruce Gowers, was also released direct-to-video the same year on VHS and Laserdisc. Currently, there is no DVD, Blu-ray, or digital media release.

Since the release of the official album, various recordings of songs performed have been released officially; however, complete performances of entire sets have only been released unofficially as bootlegs. In 2019, a limited edition vinyl-only release of Green Day&#x27;s performance was released for Record Store Day, making this one of the first official releases of an entire Woodstock &#x27;94 set.

<doc id="179260" wikidata="Q1376515" url="?curid=179260" title="No-hair theorem">
<text>The no-hair theorem states that all stationary black hole solutions of the Einstein–Maxwell equations of gravitation and electromagnetism in general relativity can be completely characterized by only three independent &quot;externally&quot; observable classical parameters: mass, angular momentum, and electric charge. Other characteristics (such as geometry and magnetic moment) are uniquely determined by these three parameters, and all other information (for which &quot;hair&quot; is a metaphor) about the matter that formed a black hole or is falling into it &quot;disappears&quot; behind the black-hole event horizon and is therefore permanently inaccessible to external observers after the black hole &quot;settles down&quot; (by emitting gravitational and electromagnetic waves). Physicist John Archibald Wheeler expressed this idea with the phrase &quot;black holes have no hair&quot;, which was the origin of the name.

In a later interview, Wheeler said that Jacob Bekenstein coined this phrase.
Richard Feynman objected to the phrase that seemed to me to best symbolize the finding of one of the graduate students: graduate student Jacob Bekenstein had shown that a black hole reveals nothing outside it of what went in, in the way of spinning electric particles. It might show electric charge, yes; mass, yes; but no other features or as he put it, &quot;A black hole has no hair&quot;. Richard Feynman thought that was an obscene phrase and he didn&#x27;t want to use it. But that is a phrase now often used to state this feature of black holes, that they don&#x27;t indicate any other properties other than a charge and angular momentum and mass.
The first version of the no-hair theorem for the simplified case of the uniqueness of the Schwarzschild metric was shown by Werner Israel in 1967. The result was quickly generalized to the cases of charged or spinning black holes. There is still no rigorous mathematical proof of a general no-hair theorem, and mathematicians refer to it as the no-hair conjecture. Even in the case of gravity alone (i.e., zero electric fields), the conjecture has only been partially resolved by results of Stephen Hawking, Brandon Carter, and David C. Robinson, under the additional hypothesis of non-degenerate event horizons and the technical, restrictive and difficult-to-justify assumption of real analyticity of the space-time continuum.

==Example==
Suppose two black holes have the same masses, electrical charges, and angular momenta, but the first black hole was made by collapsing ordinary matter whereas the second was made out of antimatter; nevertheless, then the conjecture states they will be completely indistinguishable to an observer &quot;outside the event horizon&quot;. None of the special particle physics pseudo-charges (i.e., the global charges baryonic number, leptonic number, etc., all of which would be different for the originating masses of matter that created the black holes) are conserved in the black hole, or if they are conserved somehow then their values would be unobservable from the outside.

==Changing the reference frame==
Every isolated unstable black hole decays rapidly to a stable black hole; and (excepting quantum fluctuations) stable black holes can be completely described (in a Cartesian coordinate system) at any moment in time by these eleven numbers:
* mass–energy formula_1,
* electric charge formula_2,
* position formula_3 (three components),
* linear momentum formula_4 (three components),
* angular momentum formula_5 (three components).
These numbers represent the conserved attributes of an object which can be determined from a distance by examining its gravitational and electromagnetic fields. All other variations in the black hole will either escape to infinity or be swallowed up by the black hole.

By changing the reference frame one can set the linear momentum and position to zero and orient the spin angular momentum along the positive &quot;z&quot; axis. This eliminates eight of the eleven numbers, leaving three which are independent of the reference frame: mass, angular momentum magnitude, and electric charge. Thus any black hole that has been isolated for a significant period of time can be described by the Kerr–Newman metric in an appropriately chosen reference frame.

==Extensions==
The no-hair theorem was originally formulated for black holes within the context of a four-dimensional spacetime, obeying the Einstein field equation of general relativity with zero cosmological constant, in the presence of electromagnetic fields, or optionally other fields such as scalar fields and massive vector fields (Proca fields, etc.).

It has since been extended to include the case where the cosmological constant is positive (which recent observations are tending to support).

Magnetic charge, if detected as predicted by some theories, would form the fourth parameter possessed by a classical black hole.

==Counterexamples==
Counterexamples in which the theorem fails are known in spacetime dimensions higher than four; in the presence of non-abelian Yang–Mills fields, non-abelian Proca fields, some non-minimally coupled scalar fields, or skyrmions; or in some theories of gravity other than Einstein&#x27;s general relativity. However, these exceptions are often unstable solutions and/or do not lead to conserved quantum numbers so that &quot;The &#x27;spirit&#x27; of the no-hair conjecture, however, seems to be maintained&quot;. It has been proposed that &quot;hairy&quot; black holes may be considered to be bound states of hairless black holes and solitons.

In 2004, the exact analytical solution of a (3+1)-dimensional spherically symmetric black hole with minimally coupled self-interacting scalar field was derived. This showed that, apart from mass, electrical charge and angular momentum, black holes can carry a finite scalar charge which might be a result of interaction with cosmological scalar fields such as the inflaton. The solution is stable and does not possess any unphysical properties; however, the existence of a scalar field with the desired properties is only speculative.

==Observational results==
The results from the first observation of gravitational waves in 2015 provide some experimental evidence consistent with the uniqueness of the no-hair theorem. This observation is consistent with Stephen Hawking&#x27;s theoretical work on black holes in the 1970s.

== Soft hair ==
A study by Sasha Haco, Stephen Hawking, Malcolm Perry and Andrew Strominger postulates that black holes might contain &quot;soft hair&quot;, giving the black hole more degrees of freedom than previously thought. This hair permeates at a very low-energy state, which is why it didn&#x27;t come up in previous calculations that postulated the no-hair theorem. This was the subject of Hawking&#x27;s final paper which was published posthumously.

<doc id="179261" wikidata="Q275628" url="?curid=179261" title="Renée Vivien">
<text>Renée Vivien (born Pauline Mary Tarn; 11 June 1877 – 18 November 1909) was a British poet who wrote in the French language. A high-profile lesbian writer in Paris during the Belle Époque era, she is widely considered to be one of the first noteworthy lesbian poets of the twentieth century. Her work has recently received more attention due to a revival of interest in Sapphic verse. Many of her poems are autobiographical, pertaining mostly to Baudelarian themes of extreme romanticism and frequent despair. Apart from poetry, she wrote several works of prose, including &quot;L&#x27;Etre Double&quot; (inspired by Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Christabel&quot;), and an unfinished biography of Anne Boleyn, which was published posthumously. She has also been the subject of multiple biographies, most notably those by Jean-Paul Goujon, , and .

==Biography==
===Early life===
Renée Vivien was born Pauline Mary Tarn in London, England to , a British farmer who had become wealthy through property investments, and an American mother, . Pauline attended the Belsize College in Hampstead, London, where, in 1883, she was awarded a silver medal by the &quot;Alliance française&quot; for her study of French. While she was attending school in Paris, her father died in 1886. Upon his death, Pauline returned to London to receive her inheritance from him. Purportedly, Pauline&#x27;s mother attempted to declare her legally insane so that she could have her husband&#x27;s inheritance money instead. The plot failed, and Pauline was taken away from her mother to live as a ward of the court until she came of age. In 1899, after she turned 21, Pauline returned to France with the inheritance money. It is around this time that she began to go by the name of Renée Vivien.

===Relationships===
Vivien harbored an unconsummated romantic relationship with her childhood friend and neighbor, Violet Shillito, who is thought to be referenced in Vivien’s poems with the words “violet” and “purple.” After Shillito’s death to typhoid fever, Vivien felt a sense of guilt for her relationship with American heiress Natalie Barney, who Shillito had introduced her to the year before, because she felt that she had sidelined Shillito in favour of Barney. Vivien’s feelings of guilt are thought to be a likely contributing factor—alongside Barney&#x27;s infidelities—to the end of Vivien and Barney’s relationship in 1901. 
In 1902, Vivien became romantically involved with the wealthy Baroness Hélène van Zuylen, one of the Paris Rothschilds. After her turbulent prior experience with Barney, Vivien found much-needed emotional support and stability in her relationship with Zuylen. In spite of Zuylen’s social position, which did not allow for a public relationship, the two continued a discreet affair for a number of years, often traveling together. In letters to her confidant, the French journalist and Classical scholar Jean Charles-Brun, Vivien wrote that she considered herself married to the Baroness.

While still with Zuylen, Vivien received a letter from , an admirer in Istanbul and the wife of a Turkish diplomat. The two launched a passionate correspondence, followed by brief clandestine encounters. Kérimé, though French-educated and cultivated, lived according to Islamic tradition, which meant an isolated and veiled life in which she could neither travel freely nor leave her husband. Meanwhile, Vivien continued her relationship with the Baroness de Zuylen.

In 1907, Zuylen left Vivien for another woman, which left her shocked and humiliated. Another blow came in 1908 when Kérimé, upon moving with her husband to Saint Petersburg, ended their affair.

Vivien, terribly affected by these losses, turned increasingly to alcohol and drugs. The French writer Colette, who was Vivien&#x27;s neighbour from 1906 to 1908, immortalised this period in &quot;The Pure and the Impure&quot;, a collection of portraits showing the spectrum of homosexual behaviour. Written in the 1920s and originally published in 1932, its factual accuracy is questionable; Natalie Barney reportedly did not concur with Colette&#x27;s characterization of Vivien.

=== World travels ===
Vivien was cultivated and very well travelled, especially for a woman of her era. She wintered in Egypt, visited China, and explored much of the Middle East, as well as Europe and America.

After the heartbreak from Zuylen and Kérimé, Vivien fled to Japan and then Hawaii with her mother in 1907. Vivien became ill on the voyage.

Her Paris home was a luxurious ground-floor apartment at 23, avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now 23, Avenue Foch) that opened onto a Japanese garden. She purchased antique furnishings from London and exotic objets d&#x27;art from the Far East. She kept an abundant amount of fresh flowers and offerings of Lady Apples to her collection of shrines, statuettes, icons, and Buddhas.

A public square is named in her honor in Paris: , in Le Marais, central historic district of the French capital.

=== Illness and death ===

While visiting London in 1908, Vivien tried to kill herself by drinking an excess of laudanum. As she waited to die, she stretched out on her divan with a bouquet of violets held over her heart. The suicide attempt failed. 

While in England, she contracted pleurisy and continued to grow weaker upon her eventual return to Paris. According to biographer Jean-Paul Goujon, Vivien suffered from chronic gastritis, due to years of chloral hydrate and alcohol abuse. She had also started to refuse to eat. By the summer of 1909, she walked with a cane.

Vivien died in Paris on the morning of 18 November 1909 at the age of 32; the cause of death was reported at the time as &quot;lung congestion&quot;, but likely resulted from pneumonia complicated by alcoholism, drug abuse, and anorexia nervosa . She was interred at Passy Cemetery in the same Parisian neighbourhood where she had lived.

== Works ==
=== Published works ===
Vivien wrote exclusively in French. She published her first collection of poetry, &quot;Études et préludes,&quot; in 1901. She would go on to publish 12 more collections of poetry in her lifetime. Contemporary feminists consider her to be one of the first women to write openly lesbian poetry.

In 1903, Vivien produced a translation of Sappho&#x27;s poetry from the edition of Hentry Thornton Wharton, entitled &quot;Sapho, traduction nouvelle avec le texte grec&quot; (&quot;Sapho: A New Translation with the Greek Text&quot;). [p. 78] She learned Greek by taking private lessons with a teacher, Gaetan Baron, because she wanted to read Homer in the original Greek. [p. 93] In 1904, Vivien published her autobiographical novel &quot;A Woman Appeared to Me.&quot; In 1976, the novel was translated to English by Jeanette Foster and published by Naiad Press. Naiad also published a translation of Vivien&#x27;s poetry collection, &quot;The Muse of Violets,&quot; in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;Women and Women 1978/01/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivien also published poetry and prose in collaboration with lover, Hélène van Zuylen using the pseudonym, . The true attribution of these works is uncertain, however; some scholars believe they were written solely by Vivien, as well as some other books published under Zuylen&#x27;s name.

During her brief life, Vivien was an extremely prolific poet who came to be known as the &quot;Muse of the Violets&quot;, derived from her love of the flower. Her obsession with violets (as well as with the colour violet) was likely a reminder of her beloved childhood friend, Violet Shillito.

She took to heart all the mannerisms of Parnassianism and of Symbolism, as one of the last poets to claim allegiance to the school. Her compositions include sonnets, hendecasyllabic verse, and prose poetry.

Virtually all her verse is veiled autobiography written in the French language, most of which has never been translated into English. Her principal published books of verse are &quot;Cendres et Poussières&quot; (1902), &quot;La Vénus des aveugles&quot; (1903), &quot;A l&#x27;heure des mains jointes&quot; (1906), &quot;Flambeaux éteints&quot; (1907), &quot;Sillages&quot; (1908), &quot;Poèmes en Prose&quot; (1909), &quot;Dans un coin de violettes&quot; (1909), and &quot;Haillons&quot; (1910).

Her poetry has earned even greater attention with the contemporary rediscovery of the works of Sappho, bringing with it even more acclaim.

<text>Wales (West and North) Television, known on screen as  (, Welsh for &quot;Wales Television&quot;) and often abbreviated to WWN, was the Welsh &quot;Independent Television&quot; (commercial television) contractor awarded the franchise area serving North and West Wales, from 1962 (franchise awarded 6 June 1961). It began transmitting on 14 September 1962, and ceased on 26 January 1964 through financial failure; the franchise area was soon combined with the South Wales and West of England area, operated by TWW. TWW retained the Teledu Cymru name in the former WWN franchise area, as did successor Harlech during their emergency transitional franchise, only retiring the name when they were able to officially take over.

==History==
The geography of Wales presented a daunting problem to the Independent Television Authority (ITA). The populous area of Wales in the South were already being served by TWW, which had begun broadcasting in 1958, while the north-east of the country and much of the north coast was served by the North of England weekday and weekend franchise holders, Granada and ABC, operating since 1956; the interior of north Wales could not receive ITV transmissions at all.

The ITA was pressured, by a consortium of Welsh-speaking businessmen, into setting up a new North and West Wales region; the ITA asked the Postmaster General to allow this, which he did, with strict provisos: the new service must not offer viewers in Wales a choice other viewers did not have, and at the last minute, the Postmaster General insisted that the new station should, on its own, produce ten-hours-a-week of programmes in Welsh, without relying on Welsh language programmes produced by Granada (and ABC) and TWW.

These punitive regulations were accepted, and the contract was awarded in 1961 to Wales Television Limited, which was later changed to Wales (West and North) Television Limited, following objections from TWW who felt that the original name was intruding on their area, though WWN dropped the parenthesis at every possible opportunity. WWN was to use three VHF transmitters, at Preseli (covering the south west), Arfon (north west) and Moel-y-Parc in the north east. When the Preseli transmitter came online on 14 September 1962, so did WWN, making it the 17th and last of the original ITA franchises to launch. However, the delay in introducing the transmitters at Arfon and Moel-y-Parc, until later in 1963, destroyed the morale and the finances of WWN. Free programming from the ITV network, plus other support from its neighbours ABC, ATV and TWW just about kept the ship afloat, but Manchester&#x27;s Granada Television decided to dispense with its productions in the Welsh language, and the loss of this valuable programming stream proved fatal to WWN. Local productions ceased in May 1963 and the station&#x27;s studios were reduced to a small master control until WWN could find a successor.

TWW offered a generous package to WWN&#x27;s shareholders, in order to gain control of the territory, and as per the guidance of former WWN employees, kept the Teledu Cymru name on the air for four years after the demise of its parent company on 26 January 1964. TWW successor Harlech also retained the Teledu Cymru name when TWW&#x27;s early termination of service forced them to run an emergency transitional franchise, only retiring the name when their franchise began properly.

==Studios==
WWN&#x27;s studio complex was located in Western Avenue, Cardiff, despite the fact that this area was not served by WWN but by their rivals TWW. It was from here their programmes were made and their headquarters were. The company did, however, have a regional office and news studio in the region located in Bangor. Following the acquisition of WWN by TWW, the Western Avenue base was closed, with all operations moved to TWW&#x27;s Pontcanna base, also in Cardiff. To accommodate the addition Teledu Cymru presentation, the Pontcanna studios received a large upgrade. It is believed that the Bangor base was retained by TWW. The studios on Western Avenue were eventually demolished and replaced by the new headquarters for the WJEC examining board.

==Identity==
WWN&#x27;s on screen identity featured a stylised dragon against a black background with the &#x27;Teledu Cymru&#x27; name beneath. This ident, it is believed, was the only one used by the station, whose existence was very short. Following the takeover from TWW however, the ident was modified. The dragon emblem was retained, as was the Teledu Cymru name, with the only addition being a caption below with TWW&#x27;s logo and a legend stating &#x27;Network for Wales&#x27;. The ident also now animated on screen in sections to the tune of TWW&#x27;s ident. Following TWW&#x27;s loss of contract, the Teledu Cymru name was once again utilised by the Independent Television Service for Wales and the West that ran the franchise until HTV could begin broadcasting.

<text>Very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) and very high-speed digital subscriber line 2 (VDSL2) are digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies providing data transmission faster than the earlier standards of asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) G.992.1, G.992.3 (ADSL2) and G.992.5 (ADSL2+).

VDSL offers speeds of up to 52 Mbit/s downstream and 16 Mbit/s upstream, over a single twisted pair of copper wires using the frequency band from 25 kHz to 12 MHz. These rates mean that VDSL is capable of supporting applications such as high-definition television, as well as telephone services (voice over IP) and general Internet access, over a single connection. VDSL is deployed over existing wiring used for analog telephone service and lower-speed DSL connections. This standard was approved by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in November 2001.

Second-generation systems (VDSL2; ITU-T G.993.2 approved in February 2006) use frequencies of up to 30 MHz to provide data rates exceeding 100 Mbit/s simultaneously in both the upstream and downstream directions. The maximum available bit rate is achieved at a range of about ; performance degrades as the local loop attenuation increases.

== Conceptual development ==
The concept of VDSL was first published in 1991 through a joint Bellcore-Stanford research study. The study searched for potential successors to the then-prevalent HDSL and relatively new ADSL, which were both 1.5 Mbit/s. Specifically, it explored the feasibility of symmetric and asymmetric data rates exceeding 10 Mbit/s on short phone lines.

VDSL2 standard is an enhancement to ITU T G.993.1 that supports asymmetric and symmetric transmission at a bidirectional net data rate up to 400 Mbit/s on twisted pairs using a bandwidth up to 35 MHz.

==VDSL standards==

A VDSL connection uses up to seven frequency bands, so one can allocate the data rate between upstream and downstream differently depending on the service offering and spectrum regulations. The first-generation VDSL standard specified both quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and discrete multi-tone modulation (DMT). In 2006, ITU-T standardized VDSL in recommendation G.993.2 which specified only DMT modulation for VDSL2.

==VDSL2==

VDSL2 is an enhancement to VDSL designed to support the wide deployment of triple play services such as voice, video, data and high-definition television (HDTV) VDSL2 is intended to enable operators and carriers to gradually, flexibly, and cost-efficiently upgrade existing xDSL infrastructure.

The protocol is standardized in the International Telecommunication Union telecommunications sector (ITU-T) as Recommendation G.993.2. It was announced as finalized on 27 May 2005, and first published on 17 February 2006. Several corrections and amendments were published from 2007 to 2011.

VDSL2 permits the transmission of asymmetric and symmetric aggregate data rates up to 300+ Mbit/s downstream and upstream on twisted pairs using a bandwidth up to 35 MHz on its latest version. It deteriorates quickly from a theoretical maximum of 350 Mbit/s at source to 100 Mbit/s at 500 m (1640.42 ft) and 50 Mbit/s at 1000 m (3280.84 ft), but degrades at a much slower rate from there, and outperforms VDSL. Starting from its performance is equal to ADSL2+.
ADSL-like long-reach performance is one of the key advantages of VDSL2. LR-VDSL2 enabled systems are capable of supporting speeds of around 1–4 Mbit/s (downstream) over distances of 4–5 km (2.5–3 miles), gradually increasing the bit rate up to symmetric 100 Mbit/s as loop-length shortens. This means that VDSL2-based systems, unlike VDSL systems, are not limited to short local loops or MTU/MDUs only, but can also be used for medium range applications.

Bonding (ITU-T G.998.x) may be used to combine multiple wire pairs to increase available capacity, or extend the copper network&#x27;s reach. Hybrid Access Networks
 can be used to combine xDSL with wireless networks. This enables network operators to provide faster Internet access services over long lines.

=== Vplus/35b ===
Vplus is a technology to achieve higher speeds over existing VDSL2 networks. It was developed by Alcatel-Lucent and standardised in November 2015 in ITU G.993.2
Amendment 1 as VDSL2 profile 35b. It promises to deliver speeds of up to 300 Mbit/s downstream and 100 Mbit/s upstream on loops shorter than 250 m. On longer loops, Vplus falls back to VDSL2 17a vectoring performance.
Vplus uses the same tone spacing as VDSL2 17a to allow vectoring across Vplus (35b) and 17a lines, and thus mixed deployments and a smooth introduction of Vplus.

==Profiles==
The VDSL1 standard has three bandplans: Annex A (Asymmetric BandPlan), Annex B (Symmetric BandPlan) and Annex C (Fx BandPlan). Annex A and Annex B were formerly called Plan 998 and Plan 997 respectively.
VDSL1 Annex C is intended for use in Sweden only and it uses a variable separating frequency between the second downstream band, and the second upstream band. All VDSL1 bandplans have spectrum up to 12 MHz, so the length of the copper loops must be shorter than ADSL.

The VDSL2 standard defines a wide range of profiles that can be used in different VDSL deployment architectures; in the central office, in the cabinet or in the building for example.

==VDSL2 vectoring==
Vectoring is a transmission method that employs the coordination of line signals for reduction of crosstalk levels and improvement of performance. It is based on the concept of noise cancellation, much like noise-cancelling headphones. The ITU-T G.993.5 standard, &quot;Self-FEXT cancellation (vectoring) for use with VDSL2 transceivers&quot; (2010), also known as G.vector, describes vectoring for VDSL2. The scope of Recommendation ITU-T G.993.5 is specifically limited to the self-FEXT (far-end crosstalk) cancellation in the downstream and upstream directions. The far-end crosstalk (FEXT) generated by a group of near-end transceivers and interfering with the far-end transceivers of that same group is cancelled. This cancellation takes place between VDSL2 transceivers, not necessarily of the same profile. The technology is analogous to G.INP and Seamless Rate Adaptation (SRA).

Although technically feasible, as of 2022, vectoring is incompatible with local-loop unbundling, but future standard amendments could bring a solution.

==VDSL2+ Supervectoring==

 is an evolution of the vectoring technology invented and widely implemented by Deutsche Telekom, which further increases crosstalk and interference resistance and allows for stable internet at home connections at 250 Mbit/s downstream and 100 Mbit/s upstream.

<text>Michael Joseph Savage (23 March 1872 – 27 March 1940) was an Australian-born New Zealand politician who served as the 23rd prime minister of New Zealand, heading the First Labour Government from 1935 until his death in 1940.

Savage was born in the Colony of Victoria (present-day Australia), and emigrated to New Zealand in 1907 at the age of 35. A labourer, he became a trade unionist, and in 1910 was elected president of the Auckland Trades and Labour Council. Savage supported the formation of the New Zealand Labour Party in July 1916. He was active in local politics before his election to the House of Representatives in 1919, as one of eight Labour members returned in that election. Savage was elected unopposed as Labour party leader in 1933.

Savage led the Labour Party to its first ever electoral victory in the . He won public support for his government&#x27;s economic recovery policies and social welfare programme. His popularity assured the Labour Party of an even more significant electoral victory in the . His government joined Britain in declaring war against Germany in 1939. Savage&#x27;s health declined rapidly after Labour&#x27;s second electoral victory and he died in office. He was succeeded as head of government by his deputy Peter Fraser.

Savage saw himself as spokesman on behalf of his entire party and worked to keep its multiple factions in harness, although a left-wing critic of his leadership, John A. Lee, was expelled. Commonly known as the architect of the New Zealand welfare state, Savage is generally regarded by academics and the general public as one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest and most revered prime ministers. To date he is the only New Zealand prime minister or premier to serve under three monarchs (George V, Edward VIII and George VI).

== Early life ==
Born as Michael Savage in Tatong, Victoria, Australia, he was the youngest of eight children of Irish immigrant parents. His father, Richard Savage, was a native of Dundrum, County Down and his mother Johanna Savage (née Hayes) was from Limerick. Both migrated to Australia in the 1850s to escape the Irish Famine. He received a Roman Catholic upbringing from his sister Rose, after his mother died when he was aged five. He spent five years attending a state school at Rothesay, the same town as his father&#x27;s farm. From 1886, aged 14, to 1893 Savage worked at a wine and spirits shop in Benalla. Savage also attended evening classes at Benalla College at this time. Although short in stature, Savage had enormous physical strength and made a name as both a boxer and weightlifter while enjoying dancing and many other sports.

In 1891 Savage was devastated by the deaths of both his sister Rose and his closest brother Joe. He adopted Joe&#x27;s name and became known as Michael Joseph Savage from then on. After losing his job in 1893, Savage moved to New South Wales, finding work as a labourer and irrigation ditch-digger in Narrandera for seven years. Whilst there, he joined the General Labourers&#x27; Union and became familiar with the radical political theories of the Americans Henry George and Edward Bellamy, who influenced his political policies in later life.

Savage moved back to Victoria in 1900, working a number of jobs. He became active in the Political Labor Council of Victoria, and in 1907 he was chosen as the PLC&#x27;s candidate to stand for the Wangaratta electorate. Savage had to pull out after the party was not able to fund his deposit and campaign costs, and John Thomas stood instead. He remained an active party member and became a close friend of PLC member Paddy Webb, with whom he was closely linked in later years.

==Arrival in New Zealand==
After a farewell function in Rutherglen, Savage emigrated to New Zealand in 1907. He arrived in Wellington on 9 October, which happened to be Labour Day. There he worked in a variety of jobs, as a miner, flax-cutter and storeman, before becoming involved in the union movement. Despite initially intending to join Webb on the West Coast, he decided to move north, arriving in Auckland in 1908.

He soon found board there with Alf and Elizabeth French and their two children. Alf had come to New Zealand in 1894 on the ship &quot;Wairarapa&quot;, which was wrecked on Great Barrier Island, and had helped in the rescue of a girl. Savage, who never married, lived with the French family until 1939, when he moved to the house &quot;Hill Haven&quot;, 64–66 Harbour View Road, Northland, Wellington, subsequently used by his successor as Prime Minister, Peter Fraser, until 1949. After arriving in Auckland he found employment at Hancock and Co., a brewery. The brewery was owned by a Jewish family who hired irrespective of workers faith helping Savage overcome the anti-Irish Catholic sentiments that were prevalent in much of Auckland at the time. Soon after beginning work he joined the Auckland Brewers&#x27;, Wine and Spirit Merchants&#x27; and Aerated Water Employees&#x27; Union and quickly became president of the 154 member union. He was the delegate of the union to the Auckland Trades Council and in 1910 he was elected president of the trades council.

==Political career==

Savage at first opposed the formation of the original New Zealand Labour Party as he viewed the grouping as insufficiently socialistic. Instead he became the chairman of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, known as the &quot;Red Feds&quot;. There, he assisted with organising meetings and group sessions and helped to distribute their socialist newspaper, the &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot;.

===Socialist origins===
In the 1911 and 1914 general election campaigns, Savage unsuccessfully stood as the Socialist candidate for , coming second each time to Albert Glover of the Liberal Party. During this time Savage was also involved in local union groups, becoming president of the Auckland Brewers&#x27;, Wine and Spirit Merchants&#x27; and Aerated-water Employees&#x27; Union, president of the Auckland Trades and Labour Council, the Auckland organiser for the Social Democratic Party and supported striking miners at Waihi. During the First World War he opposed conscription, arguing &quot;that the conscription of wealth should precede the conscription of men&quot;. Savage&#x27;s opposition to conscription was not absolute, rather based on balance. Indeed, he complied with a conscription order and entered a training camp in 1918, aged 46.

Savage openly supported the formation of a unified New Zealand Labour Party in July 1916, and became its national vice-president in 1918 and later the first permanent national secretary the next year. In 1919 Savage was elected as a Labour candidate to both the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Hospital and Charitable Aid Board in local body elections. He served on the Charitable Aid Board until 1922 and as a councillor until 1923 but was re-elected to the Charitable Aid Board in 1927, remaining in office until 1935.

===Member of Parliament===




As the war came to an end, the voters of the Auckland West electorate put Savage into Parliament as a Labour member in the 1919 general election, an electorate that he held until his death. He became one of eight Labour members of parliament. He formally became the party&#x27;s deputy-leader after the 1922 election, defeating Dan Sullivan eleven votes to six. Assuming an ever-increasing workload, he had resigned as Labour&#x27;s national secretary and Auckland Labour Representation Committee secretary in July 1920.

For most of the 1920s Savage sought to expand Labour&#x27;s support beyond urban unionists and travelled frequently to rural areas. He became the leading advocate for increases to pensions and universally free health care. He is credited for the creation of the Family Allowances Act 1926, which the governing Reform Party openly commented that it had modelled the legislation on three earlier defeated bills introduced by Savage. In 1927 Savage and several others persuaded the party to amend its land policy and recognise the right of freehold which was essential in gaining rural support for Labour. In doing so, Savage furthered perceptions that he was a more practical politician than then Labour leader Harry Holland. In October 1933 Holland died suddenly and Savage took his place becoming Labour&#x27;s third party Leader.

Savage later helped to engineer an alliance between Labour and the Rātana Church, which was gaining a large Māori following in the 1930s. When T .W. Rātana entered politics he allied himself with the Labour Party, which had consulted with his followers over Māori policy. The pact was formalised in a 1936 meeting between Rātana and Savage.

In 1935, Savage was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.

=== Prime minister ===
During the depression, Savage toured the country, and became an iconic figure. An excellent speaker, he became the most visible politician in the land, and led Labour to victory in the 1935 election. Along with the Premiership, he appointed himself to the posts of Minister of External Affairs and Minister of Native Affairs. In 1936 the &quot;Weekly News&quot; featured Spencer Digby&#x27;s full page iconic photograph of Savage which was often to be seen framed in many New Zealand homes through the following years. Soon after its election the government gave a &quot;Christmas bonus&quot; of £270,000 to the unemployed and needy. Savage&#x27;s government also restored wage cuts, expanded pensions, guaranteed farmers&#x27; prices, and revalued the currency.

In 1936 the government decided that broadcasting would be run by the state. As a result, a government minister in charge of Broadcasting was appointed and new legislation (the Broadcasting Act 1936) was passed that abolished the existing New Zealand Broadcasting Board and established the new National Broadcasting Service in its place. A Director of Broadcasting was appointed and a Broadcasting Advisory Council formed as a result of the act to advise the minister. The Labour Party had specifically sought to broadcast parliamentary debates via radio as a means of allowing the public to listen and make their own judgment of events, rather than relying solely on reporting the press, whom Labour were distrustful of. Savage appointed himself as the inaugural minister.

In 1936 the government instituted major reform to industrial relations legislation. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act which established a statutory minimum wage, standardised the 40-hour week and made union membership compulsory. It also restored the power of the Arbitration Court and required the court to factor in the needs of wives and dependent children of workers when making general wage orders.

While unemployment was consistently reducing the cabinet continued to spend for unemployment relief. To find a more permanent solution to the unemployment situation the government was promoting the development of secondary industries. Likewise the government announced in May 1936 a three-year public works programme. This not only provided relief work for the unemployed but also restarted the Public Works Department original function as the development arm of the state. Additionally, all relief workers were placed on standard £4 a week rate of pay.

Despite questioning the necessity for Edward VIII to abdicate, Savage sailed to Britain in 1937 to attend the coronation of King George VI, as well as the concurrent Imperial Conference. While in London, Savage differentiated himself from the other Commonwealth prime ministers when he openly criticised Britain for weakening the League of Nations and argued that the dominions were not consulted with properly on foreign policy and defence issues. Savage&#x27;s government (unlike Britain) was quick to condemn German rearmament, Japanese expansion in China and Italy&#x27;s conquest of Abyssinia. Savage criticised Britain&#x27;s appeasement policies at the conference, saying &quot;Is your policy peace at any price; if it is so I cannot accept it&quot;. Anthony Eden replied &quot;No, not at any price, but peace at almost any price&quot;, to which Savage replied: &quot;You can pay too high a price even for peace&quot;. Britain, Australia, Canada and the opposition National Party were critical of Savage for his stance.
In April 1938 Savage and his Finance Minister, Walter Nash, began planning Labour&#x27;s proposals on social security, in-line with their 1935 election promises. Responding to a suggestion from the Reverend W. H. A. Vickery, mayor of Kaiapoi, Savage began to use the term &quot;applied Christianity&quot; to describe the government&#x27;s scheme. The Social Security Bill put forward by the government boasted an unemployment benefit payable to people 16 years and over; a universal free health system extending to general practitioners, public hospitals and maternity care; a means-tested old-age pension of 30 shillings a week for men and women at age 60; and universal superannuation from age 65.

The social security scheme was a collaborative effort, with the detailed negotiations and drafting of the legislation carried out by committees of MPs and public servants. However, Savage&#x27;s personal involvement was pivotal, as he decided on the basic scheme, helped resolve deep divisions of opinion within the Labour caucus over principles and detail, made many of the major public pronouncements and guarantees, and astutely responded to opposition from the Treasury, the New Zealand branch of the British Medical Association, and the National Party. It was also Savage who insisted that the Act contain a provision that it would not come into force until 1 April 1939, thereby giving National the opportunity to revoke it if they won the 1938 general election. The First Labour Government proved popular and easily won the election, with an increased popular mandate. The Social Security Act was eventually passed, establishing the first ever social security system in the western world.

Following the 1938 election, at the first Labour caucus on 3 November, Labour under-secretary John A. Lee, a critic of Savage who was bitter about being excluded from the cabinet, attempted a caucus revolt. He moved a proposal that caucus elect a new cabinet rather than endorse either the existing one or one nominated by Savage. After a bitter debate amongst MPs the proposal was successful 26 votes to 23. However, Savage over-ruled the vote and proceeded to inform the press that cabinet would remain unchanged. In December 1938 the infamous &quot;Lee Letter&quot; appeared. It contained many attacks on the financial orthodoxy and over-cautiousness of the Labour leadership. It received wide publicity and led many in the public to question Labour&#x27;s unanimity. Lee was eventually expelled from the party by the annual conference.

====Second World War====
Savage led the country into the Second World War, officially declaring war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, just hours after Britain. Unlike Australia, which felt obligated to declare war, as it also had not ratified the Statute of Westminster, New Zealand did so as a sign of allegiance to Britain, and in recognition of Britain&#x27;s abandoning its former appeasement of the dictators, a policy that New Zealand had opposed. This led to Prime Minister Savage declaring (from his sick bed) two days later:

==Death and commemoration==

Suffering from cancer of the colon at the time of the 1938 election, Savage had delayed seeking treatment to participate in the election campaign. In late 1939, John A. Lee was censured for his comment that Savage was &quot;mentally as well as physically ill&quot;. Savage died from cancer on 27 March 1940, although the terminal nature of his illness was still being denied at the beginning of March.

Savage brought an almost religious fervour to his politics. This, and his death while in office, has made him become something of an iconic figure to the Left. Lauded for his welfare policies, Savage&#x27;s picture reportedly hung in many Labour supporters&#x27; homes. His popularity amongst the voting population was so celebrated that he is said to have remarked in disbelief to Lee that, &quot;They [the people] think I am God&quot; after Labour&#x27;s re-election in 1938. Savage returned to his Catholic roots shortly before he died.

His state funeral included a Requiem Mass celebrated at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Hill St, Wellington before his body was taken amidst general and public mourning by train to Auckland, with frequent halts to allow local people and dignitaries to pay their last respects; the journey was carried live on the radio. The mournful funeral music and speeches was lightened on arrival in Auckland when the announcer intoned reverently &quot;Sir Ernest Davis is passing round the bier&quot;; Davis, the Auckland mayor, was a wealthy brewer.

He was interred initially in a temporarily adapted harbour defence gun installation. He was soon after removed to a side chapel of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Auckland, while a national competition was announced, decided, and the winning design of the monumental tomb and memorial gardens at Bastion Point constructed, forming his permanent resting site.

Savage lies buried at Bastion Point on Auckland&#x27;s Waitematā Harbour waterfront in the Savage Memorial, a clifftop mausoleum crowned by a tall minaret, and fronted by an extensive memorial garden and reflecting pool. Savage&#x27;s body is interred in a vertical shaft below the sarcophagus. In February 1941, a competition was run by the New Zealand Government for the design of the mausoleum, won by Auckland architects Tibor Donner and Anthony Bartlett. Work begun on the memorial in June 1941, which was completed by March 1942 and officially opened in March 1943.

==Legacy==

Michael Joseph Savage is admired from many sides of the political spectrum and is known as the architect of the New Zealand welfare state. His Labour government provided the foundations of the post-war consensus, based upon the assumption that full employment would be maintained by Keynesian policies and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created.

He is considered by academics and historians to be one of New Zealand&#x27;s greatest and most revered prime ministers. Often called &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Uncle&quot;, his genial and charismatic personality, and his skills as an orator, were largely responsible for public acceptance of his government&#x27;s radical policies. Exemplifying his enthusiasm for his government&#x27;s policies, Savage personally assisted a family in Fife Lane, Miramar, Wellington, to move their furniture into the first of the government&#x27;s 1930s state houses.

The iconic 1935 portrait of Savage was hung in many New Zealand homes in the 1930s and 1940s, and previous prime minister Jacinda Ardern had a framed copy in her Beehive office. In December 2020, the original negative of the portrait was discovered in Te Papa&#x27;s collections.

Savage served as patron of the New Zealand Rugby League.

Savage was awarded the title of &quot;New Zealander of the Century&quot; by &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; in 1999.

<doc id="179269" wikidata="Q17000675" url="?curid=179269" title="Jewish views on religious pluralism">
<text>Religious pluralism is a set of religious world views that hold that one&#x27;s religion is not the sole and exclusive source of truth, and thus recognizes that some level of truth and value exists in other religions. As such, religious pluralism goes beyond religious tolerance, which is the condition of peaceful existence between adherents of different religions or religious denominations.

Within the Jewish community there lies a common history, a shared language of prayer, a shared Bible and a shared set of rabbinic literature, thus allowing for Jews of significantly different world views to share some common values and goals.

==Classical Jewish views==

===General classical views on other religions===
Traditionally, Jews believe that God chose the Jewish people to be in a unique covenant with God, described by the Torah itself, with particular obligations and responsibilities elucidated in the Oral Torah. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission: to be a light unto the nations, practice Tikkun olam and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah. This view, however, did not preclude a belief that God has a relationship with other peoplesrather, Judaism held that God had entered into a covenant with all humankind, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God; each nation with its own unique relationship with God.

Biblical references, as well as rabbinic literature, support this view: Moses refers to the &quot;God of the spirits of all flesh&quot;(), and the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) also identifies prophets outside the community of Israel (e.g., Baalam). Based on these statements, some rabbis theorized that, in the words of Nathanel ben Fayyumi, a Yemenite Jewish theologian of the 12th century, &quot;God permitted to every people something he forbade to others...[and] God sends a prophet to every people according to their own language.&quot;(Levine, 1907/1966) The Mishnah states that, &quot;Humanity was produced from one man, Adam, to show God&#x27;s greatness. When a man mints a coin in a press, each coin is identical. But when the King of Kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, creates people in the form of Adam not one is similar to any other&quot; (Mishnah Sanhedrin 4:5). The Mishnah further states that anyone who kills or saves a single human life, Jewish or otherwise, has killed or saved an entire world. The Tosefta, a supplement to the Mishnah, states: &quot;Righteous people of all nations have a share in the world to come&quot; (Tosefta Sanhedrin 13:1; Sanhedrin 105a; also Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, &quot;Hilchot Teshuvah&quot; 3:4). The Midrash adds: &quot;Why does the Holy One, blessed be He, love the righteous? Because righteousness is not due to inheritance or family connections... If a man wants to become a Kohen or a Levite, he cannot. Why? Because his father was neither a Kohen nor a Levite. However, if someone wants to become righteous, even if he is a gentile, he can, because righteousness is not inherited&quot; (Numbers Rabbah 8:2).

A traditional Jewish view is that rather than being obligated to obey all 613 mitzvot, the other nations of Earth need adhere only to a common list of commandments under seven categories that God required of the children of Noah known as the Noahide laws.

According to the Talmud, the seven Noahide laws are;
# &quot;Sh&#x27;fichat damim&quot;, to refrain from bloodshed and murder
# &quot;Dinim&quot;, to establish laws and courts of justice
# &quot;Avodah zarah&quot;, to refrain from idolatry
# &quot;Birkat Hashem,&quot;, to refrain from blasphemy
# &quot;Gilui Arayot&quot;, to refrain from sexual immorality (traditionally, incest, bestiality, adultery)
# - &quot;Gezel&quot;, to refrain from theft
# &quot;Ever min ha&#x27;Chai&quot;, to refrain from eating a limb torn from a still-living animal

Any person who lives according to these laws is known as &quot;righteous among the gentiles&quot;. Maimonides states that this refers to those who have acquired knowledge of God and act in accordance with the Noahide laws. In the 2nd century a sage in the Tosefta declared &quot;the righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come.&quot; (Tosefta, Sanhedrin 13)

Prophets of the Bible, while they repeatedly denounced the evils of the idolatrous nations (in addition to their denouncing the Jews&#x27; sins), they never call the nations to account for their idolatrous &quot;beliefs&quot; (i.e. worshiping multiple deities), but only for their evil &quot;actions&quot; (such as human sacrifice, murder, and miscarriages of justice). .

The Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Peah, states:

&quot;It is written, &quot;Justice and abundant righteousness he does not withhold&quot;. [from here we see] God does not hold back from a non-Jew who does mitzvot.

===Classical views on Christianity===
Maimonides, one of Judaism&#x27;s most important theologians and legal experts, explained in detail why Jesus was wrong to create Christianity and why Muhammad was wrong to create Islam; he laments the pains Jews have suffered in persecution from followers of these new faiths as they attempted to supplant Judaism (in the case of Christianity, called Supersessionism). However, Maimonides then goes on to say that both faiths can be considered a positive part of God&#x27;s plan to redeem the world.

:&quot;Jesus was instrumental [&quot;or, &quot;was an instrument&quot;&quot;] in changing the Torah and causing the world to err and serve another beside God. But it is beyond the human mind to fathom the designs of our Creator, for our ways are not God&#x27;s ways, neither are our thoughts His. All these matters relating to Jesus of Nazareth, and the Ishmaelite [&quot;i.e.&quot;, Muhammad] who came after him, only served to clear the way for the Jewish Messiah to prepare the whole world to worship God with one accord, as it is written &#x27;For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they all call upon the name of the Lord to serve Him with one consent.&#x27; (). Thus the Jewish hope, and the Torah, and the commandments have become familiar topics of conversation among those even on far isles, and among many people, uncircumcised of flesh and heart.&quot; (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, XI.4.)

The above paragraph was often censored from many printed versions where Christian censorship was felt.

==Modern (post-Enlightenment era) Jewish views==

===Views on dialogue with non-Jews in general===
Conservative, Reform, Reconstructionist, and a few Modern Orthodox rabbis engage in interfaith religious dialogue, while most Orthodox rabbis do not.

Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits, former Chief Rabbi of the United Synagogue of Great Britain, describes a commonly held Jewish view on this issue: &quot;Yes, I do believe in the Chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people - and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual - is &quot;chosen&quot; or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be &#x27;peculiar unto Me&#x27; as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.&quot;

The German-Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786) taught that &quot;According to the basic principles of my religion I am not to seek to convert anyone not born into our laws...We believe that the other nations of the Earth are directed by God to observe only the law of nature and the religion of the Patriarchs...I fancy that whosoever leads men to virtue in this life cannot be damned in the next.&quot;

According to the Jewish Encyclopedia article on Gentile: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah, Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697–1776) claimed: 

===Views on Jewish-Christian dialogue===

====Joseph Soloveitchik====
In practice, the predominant position of Modern Orthodoxy on this issue is based on the position of Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik in an essay entitled &quot;Confrontation&quot;. He held that Judaism and Christianity are &quot;two faith communities (which are) intrinsically antithetic&quot;. In his view &quot;the language of faith of a particular community is totally incomprehensible to the man of a different faith community. Hence the confrontation should occur not at a theological, but at a mundane human level... the great encounter between man and God is a holy, personal and private affair, incomprehensible to the outsider...&quot; As such, he ruled that theological dialogue between Judaism and Christianity was not possible.

However, Soloveitchik advocated closer ties between the Jewish and Christian communities. He held that communication between Jews and Christians was not merely permissible, but &quot;desirable and even essential&quot; on non-theological issues such as war and peace, the war on poverty, the struggle for people to gain freedom, issues of morality and civil rights, and to work together against the perceived threat of secularism.

As a result of his ruling, Orthodox Jewish groups did not operate in interfaith discussions between the Roman Catholic Church and Jews about Vatican II, a strictly theological endeavour. However, the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA), with Soloveitchik&#x27;s approval, then engaged in a number of interfaith dialogues with both Catholic and Protestant Christian groups.

Soloveitchik understood his ruling as advising against purely theological interfaith dialogue, but as allowing theological dialogue as part of a greater context. Bernard Rosensweig (former President of the RCA) writes &quot;The RCA remained loyal to the guidelines which the Rav [Soloveitch] had set down [concerning interfaith dialogue] and distinguished between theological discussions and ethical-secular concerns, which have universal validity. Every program involving either Catholic or Protestant churches in which we participated was carefully scrutinized... Every topic which had possible theological nuances or implications was vetoed, and only when the Rav pronounced it to be satisfactory did we proceed to the dialogue.&quot;

:An RCA committee was once reviewing possible topics for an inter-faith dialogue. One of the suggested topics was &quot;Man in the Image of God.&quot; Several members of the committee felt that the topic had too theological a ring, and wished to veto it. When the Rav was consulted he approved the topic and quipped, &quot;What should the topic have been? Man as a Naturalistic Creature?!&quot;
:(&quot;Lawrence Kaplan, Revisionism and the Rav: The Struggle for the Soul of Modern Orthodoxy Judaism&quot;, Summer, 1999)

The basis for Soloveitchik&#x27;s ruling was not narrowly legal, but sociological and historical. He described the traditional Jewish–Christian relationship as one of &quot;the few and weak vis-à-vis the many and the strong&quot;, one in which the Christian community historically denied the right of the Jewish community to believe and live in their own way. His response was written in the light of past Jewish-Christian religious disputations, which traditionally had been forced upon the Jewish community. Those had as their express goal the conversion of Jews to Christianity. As recently as the 1960s many traditional Jews still looked upon all interfaith dialogue with suspicion, fearing that conversion may be an ulterior motive. This was a reasonable belief, given that many Catholics and most Protestants at the time in fact held this position. Reflecting this stance, Rabbi Soloveitchik asked the Christian community to respect &quot;the right of the community of the few to live, create and worship in its own way, in freedom and with dignity.&quot;

====Other rabbinical views====
Many traditional rabbis agree; they hold that while cooperation with the Christian community is of importance, theological dialogue is unnecessary, or even misguided. Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits writes that &quot;Judaism is Judaism because it rejects Christianity, and Christianity is Christianity because it rejects Judaism.&quot; (Disputation and Dialogue: Readings in the Jewish Christian Encounter, Ed. F.E. Talmage, Ktav, 1975, p. 291.)

In later years Solovetichik&#x27;s qualified permission was interpreted more and more restrictively. (Tradition:A Journal of Orthodox Thought, Vol. 6, 1964) Today many Orthodox rabbis use Soloveitchik&#x27;s letter to justify having no discussion or joint efforts with Christians.

In contrast, some Modern Orthodox rabbis such as Eugene Korn and David Hartman hold that in some cases, the primary issue in &quot;Confrontation&quot; is no longer valid; some Christian groups no longer attempt to use interfaith dialogue to convert Jews to Christianity. They believe that the relationship between Judaism and Christianity has reached a point where Jews can trust Christian groups to respect them as equals. Further, in most nations it is not possible for Jews to be forced or pressured to convert, and many major Christian groups no longer teach that the Jews who refuse to convert are damned to hell.

In non-Orthodox denominations of Judaism most rabbis hold that Jews have nothing to fear from engaging in theological dialogue, and may have much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik&#x27;s distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.

====Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity====

On December 3, 2015, the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC) spearheaded a petition of orthodox rabbis from around the world calling for increased partnership between Jews and Christians.
The unprecedented Orthodox Rabbinic Statement on Christianity, entitled &quot;To Do the Will of Our Father in Heaven: Toward a Partnership between Jews and Christians&quot;, was initially signed by over 25 prominent Orthodox rabbis in Israel, United States and Europe and now has over 60 signatories.

====Between Jerusalem and Rome====
On August 31, 2017, representatives of the Conference of European Rabbis, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Commission of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel issued and presented the Holy See with a statement entitled &quot;Between Jerusalem and Rome&quot;. The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s Declaration &quot;Nostra Aetate&quot;, whose fourth chapter represents the Magna Charta of the Holy See&#x27;s dialogue with the Jewish world. The Statement &quot;Between Jerusalem and Rome&quot; does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same it expresses a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, now and in the future.

====Ground rules for a Christian-Jewish dialogue ====
Conservative Rabbi Robert Gordis wrote an essay on &quot;Ground Rules for a Christian Jewish Dialogue&quot;; in all Jewish denominations, one form or another of these rules eventually became more or less accepted by parties engaging in Jewish-Christian theological dialogue.

Robert Gordis held that &quot;a rational dialogue conducted on the basis of knowledge and mutual respect between the two components of the religio-ethical tradition of the Western world can prove a blessing to our age.&quot; His proposed ground rules for fair discussion are:

:(1) People should not label Jews as worshiping an inferior &quot;Old Testament God of Justice&quot; while saying that Christians worship a superior &quot;God of Love of the New Testament.&quot; Gordis gives quotations from the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) which in his view prove that this view is a misleading caricature of both religions that was created by selective quotation. (See Marcion for the historical source of this interpretation).

:(2) He holds that Christians should stop &quot;the widespread practice of contrasting the primitivism, tribalism and formalism of the Old Testament (see also Antinomianism) with the spirituality, universalism, and freedom of the New, to the manifest disadvantage of the former.&quot; Gordis again brings forth quotations from the Tanakh which in his view prove that this is a misleading caricature of both religions, created by selective quotation.

:(3) &quot;Another practice which should be surrendered is that of referring to Old Testament verses quoted in the New as original New Testament passages. Many years ago, Bertrand Russell, a well known atheist, described the Golden Rule &#x27;Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself&#x27; as New Testament teaching. When the Old Testament source (, the Great Commandment) was called to his attention, he blandly refused to recognize his error.&quot; 

:(4) Christians need to understand that while Judaism is based on the Hebrew Bible, it is not identical to the religion described in it. Rather, Judaism is based on the Bible as understood through the classical works of rabbinic literature, such as the Mishnah and Talmud. Gordis writes &quot;To describe Judaism within the framework of the Old Testament is as misleading as constructing a picture of American life in terms of the Constitution, which is, to be sure, the basic law of the land but far from coextensive with our present legal and social system.&quot;

:(5) Jews must &quot;rise above the heavy burden of historical memories which have made it difficult for them to achieve any real understanding, let alone an appreciation, of Christianity. It is not easy to wipe out the memories of centuries of persecution and , all too often dedicated to the advancement of the cause of the ...[It is] no easy task for Jews to divest themselves of the heavy burden of group memories from the past, which are unfortunately reinforced all too often by personal experiences in the present. Nevertheless, the effort must be made, if men are to emerge from the dark heritage of religious hatred which has embittered their mutual relationships for twenty centuries. There is need for Jews to surrender the stereotype of Christianity as being monolithic and unchanging and to recognize the ramifications of viewpoint and emphasis that constitute the multicolored spectrum of contemporary Christianity.&quot;

Gordis calls on Jews to &quot;see in Christian doctrine an effort to apprehend the nature of the divine that is worthy of respect and understanding&quot; and that &quot;the dogmas of the Christian church have expressed this vision of God in terms that have proved meaningful to Christian believers through the centuries.&quot; He calls on Jews to understand with tolerance and respect the historical and religious context which led Christians to develop the concepts of the Virgin Birth, the Incarnation, the Passion, and the Resurrection, even if Jews themselves do not accept these ideas as correct. Similarly, Gordis calls on Christians to understand with tolerance and respect that Jews do not accept these beliefs, since they are in contradiction to the Jewish understanding of the unity of God. (Source: &quot;The Root and the Branch&quot;, Chapter 4, Robert Gordis, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1962)

Recently, over 120 rabbis have signed the Dabru Emet (&quot;Speak the Truth&quot;), a document concerning the relationship between Judaism and Christianity. While affirming that there are substantial theological differences between the two religions, the purpose of Dabru Emet is to point out common ground. It is not an official document of any of the Jewish denominations per se, but it is representative of what many Jews feel. Dabru Emet sparked a controversy in segments of the Jewish community. Many Jews disagree with parts of it for a variety of reasons.

===Views on Jewish-Muslim dialogue===
Many Muslim and Jewish groups and individuals have together created projects working for peace among Israelis and Arabs, most of which have as one of their goals overcoming religious prejudice.

The viewpoint of Conservative Judaism is summarized in &quot;Emet Ve-Emunah: Statement of Principles of Conservative Judaism&quot;. This official statement holds that
:&quot;As Conservative Jews, we acknowledge without apology the many debts which Jewish religion and civilization owe to the nations of the world. We eschew triumphalism with respect to other ways of serving God. Maimonides believed that other monotheistic faiths, Christianity and Islam, serve to spread knowledge of, and devotion to, the God and the Torah of Israel throughout the world. Many modern thinkers, both Jewish and gentile, have noted that God may well have seen fit to enter covenants with many nations. Either outlook, when relating to others, is perfectly compatible with a commitment to one&#x27;s own faith and pattern of religious life. If we criticize triumphalism in our own community, then real dialogue with other faith groups requires that we criticize triumphalism and other failings in those quarters as well. In the second half of the twentieth century, no relationship between Jews and Christians can be dignified or honest without facing up frankly to the centuries of prejudice, theological anathema, and persecution that have been thrust upon Jewish communities, culminating in the horrors of the Shoah (Holocaust). No relationship can be nurtured between Jews and Muslims unless it acknowledges explicitly and seeks to combat the terrible social and political effects of Muslim hostility, as well as the disturbing but growing reaction of Jewish anti-Arabism in the Land of Israel. But all of these relationships, properly pursued, can bring great blessing to the Jewish community and to the world. As the late Professor Abraham Joshua Heschel put it, &quot;no religion is an island.&quot;

===Views on dialogue with other religions===
A small number of modern Jewish theologians, such as Yehezkel Kaufman and Rabbi Joseph H. Hertz, have suggested that perhaps only the Israelites were forbidden to worship idols, but perhaps such worship was permissible for members of other religions. (Yehezkel Kaufman, &quot;The Religion of Israel&quot;, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1960; J. H. Hertz, &quot;Pentateuch and Haftorahs&quot; Soncino Press, 1960, p. 759). Most Jewish theologians disagree, saying that the original meaning of the text was to condemn idolatry in total. However, a growing number of Jewish theologians question whether Hindus and Buddhists today should be considered idolaters in the Biblical sense of the term. Their reasons are that modern day Buddhists, Hindus and others (a) do not literally worship &quot;sticks and stones&quot;, as the idolaters in the Tanakh were described doing. They are well aware that icons they worship are only symbols of a deeper level of reality (though the same can be said of modern-day pagans), (b) they do not practice child sacrifice, (c) they are of high moral character, and (d) they are not anti-Jewish. Some Jews argue that God has a relationship with all gentile monotheists (or perceived monotheists), including Hindus, who in the past may have been (mis)interpreted as having a polytheist faith (see also Hindu views on monotheism), as well as with members of other religions such as Buddhism.

<text>Julius Rosenberg (May 12, 1918 – June 19, 1953) and Ethel Rosenberg (née Greenglass; September 28, 1915 – June 19, 1953) were an American married couple who were convicted of spying for the Soviet Union, including providing top-secret information about American radar, sonar, jet propulsion engines, and nuclear weapon designs. Convicted of espionage in 1951, they were executed by the federal government of the United States in 1953 using New York&#x27;s state execution chamber in Sing Sing in Ossining, New York, becoming the first American civilians to be executed for such charges and the first to be executed during peacetime. Other convicted co-conspirators were sentenced to prison, including Ethel&#x27;s brother, David Greenglass (who had made a plea agreement), Harry Gold, and Morton Sobell. Klaus Fuchs, a German scientist working at the Los Alamos Laboratory, was convicted in the United Kingdom. For decades, many people, including the Rosenbergs&#x27; sons (Michael and Robert Meeropol), have maintained that Ethel was innocent of spying and have sought an exoneration on her behalf from multiple U.S. presidents.

Among records the U.S. government declassified after the fall of the Soviet Union are many related to the Rosenbergs, included a trove of decoded Soviet cables (code-name Venona), which detailed Julius&#x27;s role as a courier and recruiter for the Soviets. In 2008, the National Archives of the United States published most of the grand jury testimony related to the prosecution of the Rosenbergs. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests filed about the Rosenbergs and the legal case against them have resulted in additional U.S. government records being made public, including formerly classified materials from U.S. intelligence agencies.

==Early lives and education==
Julius Rosenberg was born on May 12, 1918, in New York City to a family of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. The family moved to the Lower East Side by the time Julius was 11. His parents worked in the shops of the Lower East Side as Julius attended Seward Park High School. Julius became a leader in the Young Communist League USA while at City College of New York during the Great Depression. In 1939, he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering.

Ethel Greenglass was born on September 28, 1915, to a Jewish family in Manhattan. She had a brother, David Greenglass. She originally was an aspiring actress and singer but eventually took a secretarial job at a shipping company. She became involved in labor disputes and joined the Young Communist League, where she met Julius in 1936. They married in 1939.

==Espionage==
Julius Rosenberg joined the Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, in 1940, where he worked as an engineer-inspector until 1945. He was discharged when the U.S. Army discovered his previous membership in the Communist Party USA. Important research on electronics, communications, radar and guided missile controls was undertaken at Fort Monmouth during World War II.

According to a 2001 book by his former handler Alexander Feklisov, Rosenberg was originally recruited to spy for the interior ministry of the Soviet Union, NKVD, on Labor Day 1942 by a former spymaster Semyon Semyonov. By this time, following the invasion by Nazi Germany in June 1941, the Soviet Union had become an ally of the Western powers, which included the United States after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Rosenberg had been introduced to Semyonov by Bernard Schuster, a high-ranking member of the Communist Party USA and NKVD liaison for Earl Browder. After Semyonov was recalled to Moscow in 1944 his duties were taken over by Feklisov.

Rosenberg provided thousands of classified reports from Emerson Radio, including a complete proximity fuze. Under Feklisov&#x27;s supervision, Rosenberg recruited sympathetic individuals into NKVD service, including Joel Barr, Alfred Sarant, William Perl, and Morton Sobell, also an engineer. Perl supplied Feklisov, under Rosenberg&#x27;s direction, with thousands of documents from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, including a complete set of design and production drawings for Lockheed&#x27;s P-80 Shooting Star, the first U.S. operational jet fighter. Feklisov learned through Rosenberg that Ethel&#x27;s brother David was working on the top-secret Manhattan Project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory; he directed Julius to recruit Greenglass.

In February 1944, Rosenberg succeeded in recruiting a second source of Manhattan Project information, engineer Russell McNutt, who worked on designs for the plants at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. For this success Rosenberg received a $100 bonus. McNutt&#x27;s employment provided access to secrets about processes for manufacturing weapons-grade uranium. The U.S. did not share information with, nor seek assistance from, the Soviet Union regarding the Manhattan Project. The West was shocked by the speed with which the Soviets were able to stage &quot;Joe 1&quot;, its first nuclear test, on August 29, 1949. However, Lavrentiy Beria, the head official of the Soviet nuclear project, used foreign intelligence only as a third-party check rather than giving it directly to the design teams, who he did not clear to know about the espionage efforts, and the development was indigenous. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium that it could procure, it is difficult for scholars to judge accurately how much time was saved, if any.

==Rosenberg case==
===Arrest===

In January 1950, the U.S. discovered that Klaus Fuchs, a German refugee and theoretical physicist working for the British mission in the Manhattan Project, had given key documents to the Soviets throughout the war. Fuchs identified his courier as American Harry Gold, who was arrested on May 23, 1950. On June 15, 1950, Greenglass was arrested by the FBI for espionage and soon confessed to having passed secret information on to the USSR through Gold. He also claimed that Julius Rosenberg had convinced David&#x27;s wife Ruth to recruit him while visiting him in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1944. He said Julius had passed secrets and thus linked him to the Soviet contact agent Anatoli Yakovlev. This connection would be necessary as evidence if there was to be a conviction for espionage of the Rosenbergs.

On July 17, 1950, Julius was arrested on suspicion of espionage, based on Greenglass&#x27;s confession. On August 11, 1950, Ethel was arrested after testifying before a grand jury. Another conspirator, Morton Sobell, fled with his family to Mexico City after Greenglass was arrested. They took assumed names, and he tried to figure out a way to reach Europe without a passport. Abandoning that effort, he returned to Mexico City. He claimed that he was kidnapped by members of the Mexican secret police and driven to the U.S. border, where he was arrested by U.S. forces. The U.S. government claimed Sobell was arrested by the Mexican police for bank robbery on August 16, 1950, and he was extradited the next day to the United States in Laredo, Texas.

===Grand jury===

Twenty senior government officials met secretly on February 8, 1950, to discuss the Rosenberg case. Gordon Dean, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, said: &quot;It looks as though Rosenberg is the kingpin of a very large ring, and if there is any way of breaking him by having the shadow of a death penalty over him, we want to do it.&quot; Myles Lane, a member of the prosecution team, said that the case against Ethel was &quot;not too strong&quot;, but that it was &quot;very important that she be convicted too, and given a stiff sentence.&quot; FBI director J. Edgar Hoover wrote that &quot;proceeding against the wife will serve as a lever&quot; to make Julius talk.

Their case against Ethel was resolved 10 days before the start of the trial, when David and Ruth Greenglass were interviewed a second time. They were persuaded to change their original stories. David originally had said that he had passed the atomic data he had collected to Julius on a New York street corner. After being interviewed this second time, he said that he had given this information to Julius in the living room of the Rosenbergs&#x27; New York apartment. Ethel, at Julius&#x27;s request, had taken his notes and &quot;typed them up.&quot; In her second interview, Ruth expanded on her husband&#x27;s version:
Julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called Ethel and told her she had to type this information immediately ... Ethel then sat down at the typewriter which she placed on a bridge table in the living room and proceeded to type the information that David had given to Julius. As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped. On August 11, Ethel testified before a grand jury. For all questions, she asserted her right to not answer as provided by the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination. FBI agents took her into custody as she left the courthouse. Her attorney asked the U.S. commissioner to parole her in his custody over the weekend so that she could make arrangements for her two young children. The request was denied. Julius and Ethel were put under pressure to incriminate others involved in the spy ring. Neither offered any further information. On August 17, the grand jury returned an indictment alleging 11 overt acts. Both Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were indicted, as were David Greenglass and Yakovlev.

===Trial and conviction===
The trial of the Rosenbergs and Sobell on federal espionage charges began on March 6, 1951, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Irving Kaufman presided over the trial, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Irving Saypol leading the prosecution and criminal defense lawyer Emmanuel Bloch representing the Rosenbergs. The prosecution&#x27;s primary witness, David Greenglass, said that he turned over to Julius a sketch of the cross-section of an implosion-type atom bomb. This was the &quot;Fat Man&quot; bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, as opposed to a bomb with the &quot;gun method&quot; triggering device used in the &quot;Little Boy&quot; bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

On March 29, 1951, the Rosenbergs were convicted of espionage. They were sentenced to death on April 5 under Section 2 of the Espionage Act of 1917, which provides that anyone convicted of transmitting or attempting to transmit to a foreign government &quot;information relating to the national defense&quot; may be imprisoned for life or put to death.

Prosecutor Roy Cohn later claimed that his influence led to both Kaufman and Saypol being appointed to the Rosenberg case and that Kaufman imposed the death penalty based on Cohn&#x27;s personal recommendation. Cohn would go on later to work for Senator Joseph McCarthy, appointed as chief counsel to the investigations subcommittee during McCarthy&#x27;s tenure as chairman of the Senate Government Operations Committee. In imposing the death penalty, Kaufman observed that he held the Rosenbergs responsible not only for espionage but for American deaths in the Korean War:

I believe your conduct in putting into the hands of the Russians the A-bomb years before our best scientists predicted Russia would perfect the bomb has already caused, in my opinion, the Communist aggression in Korea, with the resultant casualties exceeding 50,000 and who knows but that millions more of innocent people may pay the price of your treason. Indeed, by your betrayal you undoubtedly have altered the course of history to the disadvantage of our country.

The U.S. government offered to spare the lives of both Julius and Ethel if Julius provided the names of other spies and they admitted their guilt. The Rosenbergs made a public statement: &quot;By asking us to repudiate the truth of our innocence, the government admits its own doubts concerning our guilt... we will not be coerced, even under pain of death, to bear false witness.&quot;

==After conviction==
===Campaign for clemency===
After the publication of an investigative series in the &quot;National Guardian&quot; and the formation of the National Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case, some Americans came to believe both Rosenbergs were innocent or had received too harsh a sentence, particularly Ethel. A campaign was started to try to prevent the couple&#x27;s execution. Between the trial and the executions, there were widespread protests and claims of antisemitism. At a time when American fears about communism were high, the Rosenbergs did not receive support from mainstream Jewish organizations. The American Civil Liberties Union did not find any civil liberties violations in the case.

Across the world, especially in Western European capitals, there were numerous protests with picketing and demonstrations in favor of the Rosenbergs, along with editorials in otherwise pro-American newspapers. Jean-Paul Sartre, an existentialist philosopher and writer who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, described the trial as &quot;a legal lynching&quot;. Others, including non-communists such as Jean Cocteau and Harold Urey, a Nobel Prize-winning physical chemist, as well as left-leaning figures—some being communist—such as Nelson Algren, Bertolt Brecht, Albert Einstein, Dashiell Hammett, Frida Kahlo, and Diego Rivera, protested the position of the American government in what the French termed the American Dreyfus affair. Einstein and Urey pleaded with President Harry S. Truman to pardon the Rosenbergs. In May 1951, Pablo Picasso wrote for the communist French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;: &quot;The hours count. The minutes count. Do not let this crime against humanity take place.&quot; The all-black labor union International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association Local 968 stopped working for a day in protest. Cinema artists such as Fritz Lang registered their protest. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, supported by public opinion and the media at home, ignored the overseas demands. Pope Pius XII appealed to Eisenhower to spare the couple, but Eisenhower refused on February 11, 1953. All other appeals were also unsuccessful.

Defense of the Rosenbergs surged in November and December 1952 and was organized by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—confirmation of which occurred with the publication of KGB documents obtained by Alexander Vassiliev in 2011. Proponents of clemency argued that the Rosenbergs were actually &quot;innocent Jewish peace activists&quot;. According to American historian Ronald Radosh, the Soviet Union&#x27;s goal was &quot;to deflect the world&#x27;s attention from the sordid execution of the innocent [Jewish Slánský trial defendants] in Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia.

===Execution===
The execution was delayed from the scheduled date of June 18 because Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas had granted a stay of execution on the previous day. This stay resulted from intervention in the case by Fyke Farmer, a Tennessee lawyer whose efforts had been scorned by Bloch. The execution was scheduled for 11 p.m. the evening of June 19, during the Sabbath, which begins and ends around sunset. Bloch asked for more time, filing a complaint that execution on the Sabbath offended the defendants&#x27; Jewish heritage. Rhoda Laks, another attorney on the Rosenbergs&#x27; defense team, also made this argument before Judge Kaufman. The defense&#x27;s strategy backfired. Kaufman, who stated his concerns about executing the Rosenbergs on the Sabbath, rescheduled the execution for 8 p.m.—before sunset and the Sabbath—the regular time for executions at Sing Sing where they were being held.

On June 19, 1953, Julius died from the first electric shock. Ethel&#x27;s execution did not go smoothly. After she was given the normal course of three electric shocks, attendants removed the strapping and other equipment only to have doctors determine that her heart was still beating. Two more electric shocks were applied, and at the conclusion eyewitnesses reported that smoke rose from her head. The Rosenbergs were the only American civilians executed for espionage during the Cold War. The funeral services were held in Brooklyn on June 21. The Rosenbergs were buried at Wellwood Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Pinelawn, New York. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that 500 people attended and some 10,000 stood outside:

In 1953, socialist historian W.E.B. Du Bois wrote a poem titled &quot;The Rosenbergs&quot;, which began &quot;Crucify us, Vengeance of God, as we crucify two more Jews&quot; and ended &quot;Who has been crowned on yonder stair? Red Resurrection? Or Black Despair?&quot;

==Soviet nuclear program==
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, investigated how much the Soviet spy ring helped the USSR to build its bomb. Moynihan found that in 1945 physicist Hans Bethe estimated that the Soviets would build its bomb within five years. Moynihan wrote in his book &quot;Secrecy&quot;: &quot;Thanks to information provided by their agents, they did it in four.&quot;

Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, wrote in his posthumously published memoir that he &quot;cannot specifically say what kind of help the Rosenbergs provided us&quot; but that he learned from Joseph Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov that they &quot;had provided very significant help in accelerating the production of our atomic bomb.&quot; Boris V. Brokhovich, the engineer who later became director of Chelyabinsk-40, the plutonium production reactor and extraction facility that the Soviet Union used to create its first bomb material, alleged that Khrushchev was a &quot;silly fool&quot;. He said the Soviets had developed their own bomb by trial and error. He stated: &quot;You sat the Rosenbergs in the electric chair for nothing. We got nothing from the Rosenbergs.&quot; The notes allegedly typed by Ethel apparently contained little that was directly used in the Soviet atomic bomb project. According to Julius&#x27;s contact Feklisov, the Rosenbergs did not provide the Soviet Union with any useful material about the atomic bomb: &quot;He [Julius] didn&#x27;t understand anything about the atomic bomb and he couldn&#x27;t help us.&quot;

General Leslie Groves, who developed the American nuclear program as part of the Manhattan Project, said during a United States Atomic Energy Commission hearing on Robert Oppenheimer that he thought that &quot;the data that went out in the case of the Rosenbergs was of minor value&quot;, and that he &quot;always felt the effects were greatly exaggerated, that the Russians did not get too much information out of it&quot;. Groves requested that this &quot;should be kept very quiet&quot; as he still believed the Rosenbergs deserved to die. This part of his testimony was redacted from the publicly released 1954 transcript of the Commission&#x27;s hearing on Oppenheimer and remained classified until 2014. 

==Later developments==
===1995 Venona decryptions===
The Venona project was a United States counterintelligence program to decrypt messages transmitted by the intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union. Initiated when the Soviet Union was an ally of the U.S., the program continued during the Cold War when it was considered an enemy. The Venona messages did not feature in the Rosenbergs&#x27; trial, which relied instead on testimony from their collaborators, but they heavily informed the U.S. government&#x27;s overall approach to investigating and prosecuting domestic communists.

In 1995, the U.S. government made public many documents decoded by the Venona project, showing Julius Rosenberg&#x27;s role as part of a productive ring of spies. For example, a 1944 cable (which gives the name of Ruth Greenglass in clear text) says that Ruth&#x27;s husband David is being recruited as a spy by his sister (that is, Ethel Rosenberg) and her husband. The cable also makes clear that the sister&#x27;s husband is involved enough in espionage to have his own codename (&quot;Antenna&quot; and later &quot;Liberal&quot;). Ethel did not have a codename; however, KGB messages which were contained in the Venona project&#x27;s Alexander Vassiliev files, and which were not made public until 2009, revealed that both Ethel and Julius had regular contact with at least two KGB agents and were active in recruiting both David Greenglass and Russell McNutt.

===2001 David Greenglass statements===

In 2001, David Greenglass recanted his testimony about his sister having typed the notes. He said &quot;I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don&#x27;t remember.&quot; He said he gave false testimony to protect himself and his wife and that he was encouraged by the prosecution to do so. &quot;My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, OK? And she was the mother of my children.&quot; He refused to express remorse for his decision to betray his sister, saying only that he did not realize that the prosecution would push for the death penalty. He stated, &quot;I would not sacrifice my wife and my children for my sister.&quot;

===2008 release of grand jury testimony===
At the grand jury, Ruth Greenglass was asked, &quot;Didn&#x27;t you write [the information] down on a piece of paper?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes, I wrote [the information] down on a piece of paper and [Julius Rosenberg] took it with him.&quot; At the trial, she testified that Ethel typed notes about the atomic bomb. Numerous articles were published in 2008 related to the Rosenberg case. Deputy Attorney General of the United States William P. Rogers, who had been part of the prosecution of the Rosenbergs, discussed their strategy at the time in relation to seeking the death sentence for Ethel. He said they had urged the death sentence for Ethel in an effort to extract a full confession from Julius. He reportedly said &quot;she called our bluff&quot; as she made no effort to push her husband to any action.

===2008 Morton Sobell&#x27;s statements===

In September 2008, Morton Sobell was interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; after the revelations from grand jury testimony. He admitted that he had given documents to the Soviet contact but said these had to do with defensive radar and weaponry. He confirmed that Julius Rosenberg was &quot;in a conspiracy that delivered to the Soviets classified military and industrial information... [on] the atomic bomb&quot;, and &quot;[Julius] never told me about anything else that he was engaged in.&quot;

Sobell said that he thought the hand-drawn diagrams and other atomic-bomb details acquired by Greenglass and passed to Julius were of &quot;little value&quot; to the Soviet Union and were used only to corroborate what they had learned from the other atomic spies. He also said that he believed Ethel Rosenberg was aware of her husband&#x27;s deeds but took no part in them. In a follow-up letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, one week after the first interview was published, Sobell denied that he knew anything about Julius Rosenberg&#x27;s alleged atomic espionage activities, and that the only thing he knew for sure was what he himself did in association with Julius Rosenberg.

===2009 Vassiliev notebooks based on KGB archives===
In 2009, extensive notes collected from KGB archives were made public in a book published by Yale University Press: &quot;Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America&quot;, written by John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev; Vassiliev&#x27;s notebooks included KGB comments concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and make clear that the KGB considered Julius Rosenberg an effective agent and Ethel a supporter of his work. According to Vassiliev, Julius and Ethel worked personally with KGB agents who were given the codenames &quot;Twain&quot; and &quot;Callistratus&quot;, and were also described as being the ones who recruited Greenglass and McNutt for the Manhattan Project spy mission. Although the public release of Vassiliev&#x27;s notebooks did not occur until 2009, the notebooks had been originally intercepted during the Venona decryptions.

===Rosenberg children===
The Rosenbergs&#x27; two sons, Michael and Robert, spent years trying to prove the innocence of their parents. They were orphaned by the executions and were not adopted by their many aunts or uncles, although they initially spent time under the care of their grandmothers and in a children&#x27;s home. They were adopted by the communist activist Abel Meeropol and his wife Anne and assumed the Meeropol surname. After Sobell&#x27;s 2008 confession, they acknowledged their father had been involved in espionage but that in their view the case was riddled with prosecutorial and judicial misconduct, that their mother was convicted on flimsy evidence to place leverage on her husband, and that neither deserved the death penalty.

Michael and Robert co-wrote a book about their and their parents&#x27; lives, &quot;We Are Your Sons: The Legacy of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg&quot; (1975). Robert wrote the memoir &quot;An Execution in the Family: One Son&#x27;s Journey&quot; (2003). In 1990, he founded the Rosenberg Fund for Children, a nonprofit foundation that provides support for children of targeted liberal activists and youth who are targeted as activists. Michael&#x27;s daughter Ivy Meeropol directed a 2004 documentary about her grandparents, &quot;Heir to an Execution&quot;, which was featured at the Sundance Film Festival. Their sons&#x27; current position is that Julius was legally guilty of the conspiracy charge, although not of atomic spying, while Ethel was only generally aware of his activities. The children say that their father did not deserve the death penalty and that their mother was wrongly convicted. They continue to campaign for Ethel to be posthumously legally exonerated.

In 2015, following the most recent grand jury transcript release, Michael and Robert Meeropol called on U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration to acknowledge that Ethel Rosenberg&#x27;s conviction and execution was wrongful and to issue a proclamation exonerating her, though her innocence is still not proven. In March 2016, Michael and Robert (via the Rosenberg Fund for Children) launched a petition campaign calling on President Obama and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to formally exonerate Ethel Rosenberg. In October 2016, both Michael and Robert Meeropol spoke with Anderson Cooper in an interview which aired on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. In January 2017, Senator Elizabeth Warren sent Obama a letter requesting consideration of the exoneration request. In 2021, Ethel&#x27;s sons restarted the campaign to pardon Ethel as they were optimistic that President Joe Biden would consider this favorably. &quot;Ethel Rosenberg: A Cold War Tragedy&quot; by Anne Sebba was published by Orion Books in 2021. Michael and Robert were requesting Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines to release the records related to their mother&#x27;s case, per a 2009 executive order.

In 2024, the Meeropols were given a copy of a contemporary hand-written memo by Meredith Gardner, a linguist and codebreaker at what later became the NSA, based on Russian decrypts. It claimed that Ethel Rosenberg knew about Julius&#x27; espionage work but that &quot;due to ill health she did not engage in the work herself&quot;.

==Artistic representations==
The song &quot;Julius and Ethel&quot; written by Bob Dylan in 1983 is based on the Rosenberg case. Images of the Rosenbergs are engraved on a memorial in Havana, Cuba. The accompanying caption says they were murdered. Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz dedicated a poem to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Its title in Urdu is &quot;Hum Jo Tareek Raho May Mary Gaye&quot;.

<text>Carol Lynn Maillard (born 1951) is an American actress, singer, and composer. She is one of the founding members of the Grammy Award-winning a cappella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in Philadelphia, Maillard was a student of the GESU SCHOOL in Philadelphia and also graduated from John W. Hallahan Catholic Girls&#x27; High School. She graduated from The Catholic University of America with a major in theater in 1973.

==Career==
===Stage and Screen===
Maillard has acting credits that include roles on Broadway (&quot;Eubie!&quot;, &quot;Comin&#x27; Uptown&quot;, &quot;Beehive&quot;); Off-Broadway (in several Negro Ensemble Company productions like Zooman and the Sign, and in New York Shakespeare Festival productions); television (&quot;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;); and film (&quot;Beloved&quot;, &quot;Thirty to Life&quot;). Much of her career has involved participating in works that are Afro-centric and steeped in African American orality, as well as uplift and support of Black culture

===Music===

<text>The flag of England is the national flag of England, a constituent country of the United Kingdom. It is derived from Saint George&#x27;s Cross (heraldic blazon: &quot;Argent, a cross gules&quot;). The association of the red cross as an emblem of England can be traced back to the Late Middle Ages when it was gradually, increasingly, used alongside the Royal Banner. It became the only saint&#x27;s flag permitted to be flown in public as part of the English Reformation and at a similar time became the pre-eminent maritime flag referred to as a white ensign.
It was used as a component in the design of the Union Jack in 1606.

It has been widely used since the 1990s, specifically at national sporting events, especially during the campaigns of England&#x27;s national football teams.

==Origins==


In 1188 Henry II of England and Philip II of France agreed to go on a crusade, and that Henry would use a white cross and Philip a red cross (and not vice versa as suggested by later use).

There then follows a historiographical tradition claiming that Richard the Lionheart himself adopted the full red cross flag and the patron saint from the Republic of Genoa at some point during his crusade. This idea can be traced to the Victorian era, Perrin (1922) refers to it as a &quot;common belief&quot;, and it is still popularly repeated today even though it cannot be substantiated.
Prince Edward, Duke of Kent made a variation to this in a bilingual preface to a brochure made for the British Pavilion at Genoa Expo &#x27;92. The relevant passage read:
The St. George&#x27;s flag, a red cross on a white field, was adopted by England and the City of London in 1190 for their ships entering the Mediterranean to benefit from the protection of the Genoese fleet. The English Monarch paid an annual tribute to the Doge of Genoa for this privilege

Red crosses seem to have been used as a distinguishing mark worn by English soldiers from the reign of Edward I (1270s), or perhaps slightly earlier, in the Battle of Evesham of 1265, using a red cross on their uniforms to distinguish themselves from the white crosses used by the rebel barons at the Battle of Lewes a year earlier. Perrin notes a roll of accounts from 1277 where the purchase of cloth for the king&#x27;s tailor is identified as destined for the manufacture of a large number of pennoncels (pennons attached to lances) and bracers (worn by archers on their left forearms) &quot;of the arms of Saint George&quot; for the use by the king&#x27;s foot soldiers (). Perrin concludes from this that the introduction of the Cross of St George as a &quot;national emblem&quot; is originally due to Edward I. By 1300, there was also a greater &quot;banner of Saint George&quot;, but not yet in a prominent function; the king used it among especially banners of king-saints Saint Edward the Confessor and Saint Edmund the Martyr alongside the royal banner. George had become popular as a &quot;warrior saint&quot; during the Crusades, but the saint most closely associated with England was Edward the Confessor. This was so until the time of Edward III, who in thanks for Saint George&#x27;s supposed intervention in his favour at the Battle of Crécy gave him a special position as a patron saint of the inceptive Order of the Garter in 1348. From that time, his banner was used with increasing prominence alongside the Royal Banner and became a fixed element in the hoist of the Royal Standard. Yet the flag shown for England in the &quot;Book of All Kingdoms&quot; of 1367 is solid red (while Saint George&#x27;s Cross is shown for Nice and, in a five-cross version, for Tbilisi). The Wilton Diptych from the late 1390s shows a swallow-tailed Saint George cross pennant held by an angel in between (the then reigning) King Richard II (accompanied by Edward the Confessor and Edmund the Martyr) and a scene of the Virgin and Child flanked by angels wearing Richard&#x27;s own heraldic devices.

Saint George&#x27;s Day was considered a &quot;double major feast&quot; from 1415, but George was still eclipsed by his &quot;rivals&quot; Saints Edward and Edmund.

John Cabot, commissioned by Henry VII to sail &quot;under our banners, flags and ensigns&quot;, may have taken a Saint George&#x27;s banner to Newfoundland in 1497.

That Saint George is the primary patron saint of England is among several lasting changes of height of the English Protestant Reformation, via the content which the teenage king and his Protestant advisors issued to all churches and clerics. These rules were the revised prayer book of 1552. Just as with the Marian persecutions (four years of counter-revolution after his natural death) all defecting clerics faced likely deprivation which was the loss of their office and if more broadly heretical, burning at the stake. The book made clear all religious flags, including saints&#x27; banners except for Saint George were abolished. 

Further use of this cross as a maritime flag alongside royal banners, is found in 1545.

&quot;Henry V&quot;, the history play by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written near 1599 includes the fictitious scene of the battle of Agincourt where the king&#x27;s final rally is:
Cry &#x27;God for Harry! England, and Saint George!&quot;
[Exeunt. Alarum, and chambers go off.]
thus promoting the notion that the cult or festivities specifically to the saint, or focus on the Order of the Garter put him significantly ahead of two other national saints – instead of depicting that they were approximately equal. The quote became rapidly well known in London, across social classes, and thus imagery entrenched that Saint George was &quot;historically&quot; the primary saint.

In 1606, after the Union of the Crowns in 1603, it was combined with the Scottish St Andrew&#x27;s Cross to form the Union Jack, which James VI &amp; I ordered be flown from the main tops of ships from both England and Scotland. The &quot;Red Crosse&quot; continued to be flown from the fore-top by James&#x27; subjects in &quot;South Britaine&quot;—i.e., the Saint George cross was used with the new union flag on English vessels.

In the 19th century, it became desirable for all nations of Europe (and later worldwide) to identify a national flag. During that time, the terms Britain and England were used largely interchangeably, the Union Flag was used as national flag de facto, even though never officially adopted. The observation that the Cross of St George is the &quot;national flag of England&quot; (as opposed to the Union Flag being the flag of all of the United Kingdom) was made in the context of Irish irredentism, as noted by G. K. Chesterton in 1933:

As a very sensible Irishman said in a letter to a Dublin paper: &quot;The Union Jack is not the national flag of England.&quot; The national flag of England is the Cross of St. George; and that, oddly enough, was splashed from one end of Dublin to the other; it was mostly displayed on shield-shaped banners, and may have been regarded by many as merely religious.

==Derived flags==

===Union Flag===

The flag of England is one of the key components of the Union Flag. The Union Flag has been used in a variety of forms since the proclamation by Orders in Council 1606, when the flags of Scotland and England were first merged to symbolise the Union of the Crowns. (The Union of the Crowns having occurred in 1603). In Scotland, and in particular on Scottish vessels at sea, historical evidence suggests that a separate design of Union Flag was flown to that used in England. 
In the Acts of Union of 1707, which united the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England to become the Kingdom of Great Britain, it was declared that &quot;the Crosses of St. George and St. Andrew be conjoined, in such Manner as her Majesty shall think fit, and used in all Flags, Banners, Standards and Ensigns, both at Sea and Land.&quot;

From 1801, to symbolise the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland, a new design which included St Patrick&#x27;s Cross was adopted for the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Flag of the United Kingdom, having remained unchanged following the partition of Ireland in 1921 and creation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, continues to be used as the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

===City of London===
The flag of the City of London is based on the English flag, having a centred St George&#x27;s Cross on a white background, with a red sword in the upper hoist canton (the top left quarter). The sword is believed to represent the sword that beheaded Saint Paul who is the patron saint of the city.

===Royal Navy===
The flag used by the British Royal Navy (the White Ensign) is also based on the flag of England, consisting of St George&#x27;s Cross and a Union Flag in the canton. In addition to the United Kingdom, several countries in the Commonwealth of Nations also have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with St George&#x27;s Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge.

===Universities of England===
==Contemporary use==
===Church of England===
Churches belonging to the Church of England which have a pole may fly St George&#x27;s Cross. A desirable variant (per an order from the Earl Marshal in 1938) is for the church to fly the flag with the arms of the diocese in the left-hand upper corner.
===Sporting events===
The flag heavily dominates for that of England at sports events in which England competes, for example during England Cricket matches (the Cricket World Cup and The Ashes), during Rugby Union matches and in football. It is also used in icons on the internet and on the TV screen to represent teams and players from England.

For at least some decades before about 1996, most of the flags waved by supporters were Union Flags. In a sporting context, the flag is often seen being waved by supporters with the addition of &#x27;ENGLAND&#x27; across its horizontal bar.

=== English nationalism ===

As the flag of England, it is used in English nationalism. This is largely in parallel to the use of the flag of Scotland in Scottish nationalism. However Scotland has been recognised as a nation within a nation. The flag of Scotland has been officially defined by the Scottish Parliament in 2003 and is flown there and almost universally by Scottish authorities. There is no English legislature; the entire British legislature sits in England and is only subject to very weak conventions on voting on English matters. The flag of England does not figure in legislation, and its use by English nationalists is complex as these divide among those who are far-right as heavily opposed to further immigration and seeking to distinguish between residents in the jobs market and welfare state system such as the British National Party (founded 1982) and the English Defence League (founded 2009) and those who merely seek the level of devolution of Scotland, or Wales. Underscoring this complexity, in January 2012 Simon Hughes, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, supported calls for a devolved English parliament and which continues under such lobbies as the Campaign for an English Parliament, and is occasionally a minor debate subject at all of the major parties&#x27; annual conferences.

Since the flag&#x27;s widespread use in sporting events since the mid-1990s, the association with far-right nationalism has waned, and the flag is now frequently flown throughout the country both privately and by local authorities.

==Outside England==
Due to the spread of the British Empire, the flag of England is currently, and was formerly used on various flags and coats of arms of different countries, states and provinces throughout the territories of the British Empire. St George&#x27;s Cross is also used as the city flag of some northern Italian cities, such as Milan and Bologna and other countries such as Georgia.

==In Unicode==
In 2017, the Unicode Consortium approved emoji support for the flag of England, alongside the flags of Scotland and Wales, in Unicode version 10.0 and Emoji version 5.0. This was following a proposal from Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia and Owen Williams of BBC Wales in March 2016, The flag is implemented using the regional indicator symbol sequence . Prior to this update, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that users had &quot;been able to send emojis of the Union Flag, but not of the individual nations&quot;.

<text>ABC Television Limited, popularly known as ABC Weekend TV, was a British broadcaster which provided the weekend service in the Midlands and Northern England regions of the Independent Television (ITV) network from 1956 to 1968. It was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; companies that between them produced the majority of ITV networked programmes during this period.

Originally created as Associated British Cinemas (Television) Ltd, ABC was one of a number of commercial television companies established during the 1950s by cinema chain companies, in an attempt to safeguard their business by becoming involved with television, which was taking away their cinema audiences. In this case, the parent company was the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC)—owner of ABC Cinemas—which initially did not wish to become involved with the new broadcasting system, but was persuaded to do so by the Independent Television Authority (ITA) and the manager of its Pathé News subsidiary Howard Thomas, who became the new company&#x27;s managing director.

ABC operated two franchises, one in the Midlands, which was the fourth ITA franchise to go on air, in 1956, and the other in the North of England, which was the sixth franchise to go on air, later the same year. It lost both its franchises in 1968, but merged with another franchisee to form Thames Television, which held the London weekday franchise for 24 years.

From 1967, ABC&#x27;s sister company, ABC Television Films, used the name Associated British Corporation on its exports to the US, such as the last two series of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
When Kemsley-Winnick, one of the consortia that had been awarded two franchises in the new Independent Television network in 1954, collapsed, the ITA approached ABPC to step into the breach. The Corporation agreed to assume the franchises to broadcast on Saturdays and Sundays to the Midlands and the North of England. The contract agreeing to do so was signed on 21 September 1955, the day before Independent Television (ITV) began in London.

This left the new ABC five months to begin broadcasting in the Midlands, the service beginning on 18 February 1956. Soon afterwards, it was also up and running in the North; it began broadcasting in the North West on 5 May 1956, and in Yorkshire on 3 November 1956. It was aided in part by the failure of the original contractor; Kelmsley-Winnick had ordered over £1 million (equivalent to £ million today) of production equipment from manufacturer Pye, which it sold to ABC at a much-discounted price.

=== Relations with ITA, ITN and ATV ===

====ATV====
The London weekend contractor had launched under the name &quot;Associated Broadcasting Company&quot; (ABC), but ABPC wanted to use the ABC brand for its own service, to match its existing ABC Cinemas brand, so it took legal action against the Associated Broadcasting Company who subsequently agreed to rename as Associated Television (ATV) after broadcasting for three weeks as &quot;ABC&quot;. This allowed ABPC to launch its own station as &quot;ABC&quot;.

====ITN====
ABC&#x27;s late entry into Independent Television meant that some of the details of how the new system would run were already agreed between the ITA regulator and the other three contractors. ABC felt that some of these details were unfair on itself as the smallest contractor, and the only contractor that broadcast only at weekends.

In particular, ABC objected to paying one-quarter of the costs for ITN, provider of national news broadcasts for the network, as there would be fewer news programmes at the weekend than on weekdays. ABC&#x27;s managing director Howard Thomas, former head of Pathé News, felt that ABC could provide its own news for a fraction of ITN&#x27;s price, but the ITA would not allow this: regional companies were responsible only for regional news, and national news should be independent of the regional companies. ABC lobbied both ITN and the ITA for change, which eventually resulted in a cutback to the amount of programming to be provided by ITN to the network and a substantial reduction in ITN&#x27;s costs.

====Presentation====
Once the &quot;Big Four&quot; companies were in profit, the ITA reviewed the performance each of them. ABC escaped with little criticism, except for its presentation, which was considered to be dull and too closely aligned with its sister &quot;ABC Cinemas&quot; brand. ABC took this to heart and launched a new look in September 1959.

====ATV again====
Of the original four ITV contractors, ABC had difficulty getting its programmes shown in the London region, which was hampering its reputation. Two of the other contractors had London franchises, and Granada seemed to have a good working relationship with Associated-Rediffusion to show its programmes. ABC found itself in a head-to-head battle with ATV, as, in the early years, these were the only two companies whose franchises operated at the weekend.

ATV had close connections with the Moss Empires theatre chain (through ATV&#x27;s Val Parnell) and the Grade Organisation theatrical talent agency (through ATV&#x27;s Lew Grade and his brother Leslie) and felt they had the expertise to make expensive, high-status drama, variety and comedy shows, and leave the cheaper &quot;provincial&quot; off-peak weekend programming to ABC. This would have been to ABC&#x27;s financial disadvantage, since ABC (with its two regions to ATV&#x27;s one region at the weekends) would have to pay two-thirds of the expensive costs of ATV London&#x27;s shows, while ATV would pay only one-third of the costs of ABC&#x27;s cheaper shows.

ABC fought back, first of all, by selling some of its pre-recorded shows to Associated-Rediffusion (instead of ATV) to broadcast to London on weekdays. Secondly, it refused to buy some of ATV&#x27;s top-rated shows such as &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; and broadcast its own alternatives such as &quot;Blackpool Night Out&quot;. Eventually ATV gave way and agreed to buy more of ABC&#x27;s shows.

===Loss of franchise===
Structural changes in the regional contract areas meant that ABC no longer had a contract to reapply for in 1967. The Northern area (split into North West and Yorkshire) was to become a seven-day operation, as would the Midlands. Existing weekday contractors (Granada and ATV respectively) were correctly considered the favourites. ABC consequently submitted two applications: one for the service for London at the weekend, the other for the Midlands seven-day operation, although it favoured the first contract.

It was expected that ABC would be awarded the weekend London licence, but the strength of another application (from the London Weekend Television consortium) ruled this out. This led to a situation where a successful company could be closed down through no fault of its own. To prevent this, the governing body of ITV, the Independent Television Authority, ordered a merger with the existing London weekday company Rediffusion, with ABC having majority control of the new operation.

Despite protests from Rediffusion, the two companies eventually became Thames Television. ABC ceased weekend broadcasting in the North and Midlands regions on Sunday 28 July 1968 and resumed on Tuesday 30 July in the London region as weekday company Thames.

==Studios==

ABC operated three production sites and had a further sales office. The main production facilities were the former Warner Studios in Teddington, Middlesex. Although this was outside its contract area, ABC wanted a London base, as many performers could not venture outside of the capital to record programmes because they were often committed to runs of theatre plays in the West End. Upon the merger with Rediffusion, this site became the main production base for the new company Thames Television.

In the Midlands, ABC formed a joint venture with Midlands weekday licensee ATV to oversee the running of a production and transmission facility to be used by both. Alpha Television purchased a former cinema in Aston, near Birmingham, and extended it by the construction of additional studios and office space; the site was known as the Alpha Studios.

ABC operated a northern studio centre in Manchester and a sales office based in Television House in the city centre. The production facility was converted from a former Capitol cinema in Didsbury. ABC vacated both premises during 1968. ABC also made some entertainment shows such as &quot;Blackpool Night Out&quot; and &quot;The Blackpool Show&quot; at the ABC Theatre in Blackpool (owned by ABC-TV&#x27;s sister company ABC Cinemas). For its pre-filmed series, such as &quot;The Avengers&quot; (from 1965), ABC used its parent company&#x27;s Associated British Elstree Studios.

==Identity==

When ABC first went on the air, it used the branding of its sister company ABC Cinemas. This featured a triangular shield with the letters ABC upon it, and a bar across it with the caption &#x27;Television&#x27;. This lasted from the station&#x27;s launch in 1956 until September 1959. The ITA had criticised ABC&#x27;s original presentation style for being bland and too much attached to the existing ABC Cinemas chain.

As a result, ABC created a new brand ident featuring three arrows pointing to the bottom of the screen to reveal the letters ABC in turn and leaving a triangle behind and on top of the letters. At the end of this, the three triangles would snap together into the new ABC logo. This ident lasted until 1964 when the lettering font was altered slightly from a serif font to the latest bold used by the company, this revision lasting until the company&#x27;s demise.

The logo uses the notion of threes, three triangles making another triangle, with the points of a triangle often being labelled &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; in geometry. The tune that was used for all of ABC&#x27;s idents was a vibraphone playing the notes A-B-C (la-te-doh). Out of this look, ABC Television developed a strong corporate identity, effectively becoming the first British TV station to recognise the importance of corporate branding.

The company itself was originally called &quot;Associated British Cinemas (Television) Limited&quot;, which by 1957 had been shortened to &quot;A.B.C. Television Limited&quot;. However, from about 1967, on exports made by its sister company A.B.C. Television Films Ltd. (such as the last two series of &quot;The Avengers&quot;), the name &#x27;Associated British Corporation&#x27; was used, to avoid confusion with the US ABC network. As for on-air, the name was for a few months &#x27;Associated British&#x27;, before becoming &#x27;ABC Television&#x27;, or just &#x27;ABC&#x27;. The names &#x27;ABC Television Network&#x27; and &#x27;ABC Weekend Network&#x27; were also used, for example in &quot;TV Times&quot; listings. The station received a joke nickname from Bob Monkhouse, namely &quot;All Bloody Commercials&quot;.

The station&#x27;s spoken slogan varied through time, starting off as &quot;ABC – Associated British in the North/Midlands&quot; before being replaced in 1958 to &quot;ABC, your weekend TV&quot; and again changed in 1964 to &quot;ABC, your weekend television in the North/Midlands&quot;.

== Programming ==
Networked programmes from ABC included the drama series &quot;Police Surgeon&quot;, &quot;The Human Jungle&quot;, &quot;Undermind&quot;, &quot;Redcap&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, the &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; series of single plays, the &quot;Habatales&quot; cartoons, the popular shows &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;, &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;, &quot;Big Night Out&quot;, &quot;Doddy&#x27;s Music Box&quot; and &quot;Oh Boy!&quot;, Tommy Cooper&#x27;s shows &quot;Cooperama&quot; and &quot;Life with Cooper&quot;, the children&#x27;s science fiction serials &quot;Emerald Soup&quot;, &quot;Target Luna&quot; and its sequels &quot;Pathfinders in Space&quot;, &quot;Pathfinders to Mars&quot; and &quot;Pathfinders to Venus&quot;, and the gritty drama series &quot;Callan&quot; and &quot;Public Eye&quot; (both of which continued as Thames productions after 1968). ITV&#x27;s first weekly series devoted to the arts, &quot;Tempo&quot;, was introduced by ABC, as was its first hidden camera show, &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, and its first attempt to challenge the BBC&#x27;s dominance of television sport, with &quot;World of Sport&quot;. ABC also introduced British television&#x27;s first late night chat show, &quot;The Eamonn Andrews Show&quot; and, together with ATV, British television&#x27;s first regular weekly series of adult education programmes.

== Service areas ==
Areas are described in terms of the county boundaries at the time. After ABC&#x27;s closure there were significant county boundary changes in 1974, and ITV&#x27;s regional boundaries have also changed over time.

ABC&#x27;s two franchise regions each had their own continuity announcers, advertisements and regional programmes (mainly news and weather, and the magazine shows &quot;ABC of the Midlands&quot; and &quot;ABC of the North&quot;). Apart from those exceptions, both regions usually showed the same programmes simultaneously.

<text>The flag of Scotland (; , also known as St Andrew&#x27;s Cross or the Saltire) is the national flag of Scotland, which consists of a white saltire defacing a blue field. The Saltire, rather than the Royal Standard of Scotland, is the correct flag for all private individuals and corporate bodies to fly. It is also, where possible, flown from Scottish Government buildings every day from 8:00 am until sunset, with certain exceptions.

Use of the flag is first recorded with the illustration of a heraldic flag in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount&#x27;s &quot;Register of Scottish Arms,&quot; . It is possible that this is based on a precedent of the late 15th century, the use of a white saltire in the canton of a blue flag reputedly made by Queen Margaret, wife of James III (1451–1488).

==Design==
The heraldic term for an X-shaped cross is a &#x27;saltire&#x27;, from the old French word or (itself derived from the Latin ), a word for both a type of stile constructed from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, the Scottish flag may be blazoned &quot;azure, a saltire argent&quot;. The tincture of the Saltire can appear as either silver (&quot;argent&quot;) or white. However, the term &quot;azure&quot; does not refer to a particular shade of blue.

Throughout the history of fabric production natural dyes have been used to apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo and woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly selected on the basis of the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.

These variations in shade eventually led to calls to standardise the colour of Scotland&#x27;s national flag, and in 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament met to examine a petition that the Scottish Executive adopt the Pantone 300 colour as a standard (this blue is of a lighter shade than the Pantone 280 of the Union Flag). Having taken advice from a number of sources, including the office of the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the committee recommended that the optimum shade of blue for the Saltire be Pantone 300. Recent versions of the Saltire have therefore largely converged on this official recommendation (Pantone 300 is #005EB8 as a web colour).

The flag proportions are not fixed but 3:5 is most commonly used, as with other flags of the countries of the United Kingdom (flag manufacturers themselves may adopt alternative ratios, including 1:2 or 2:3). Lord Lyon King of Arms states that 4:5 is suitable. The ratio of the width of the bars of the saltire in relation to the width of the field is specified in heraldry in relation to shield width rather than flag width. However, this ratio, though not rigid, is specified as one-third to one-fifth of the width of the field.

==History==


According to legend, the use of the Saltire as the flag of Scotland originated on the eve of the Battle of Athelstaneford in 832. The 1320 Declaration of Arbroath cites Scotland&#x27;s conversion to Christianity by St. Andrew, &quot;the first to be an Apostle&quot;. Depiction of the saint being crucified on a decussate cross was seen on seals in Scotland from 1180 onwards and was used on a seal of the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Bishop William de Lamberton (r. 1297–1328) also used the crucified figure of the saint in his seal.

The saltire (decussate cross, diagonal cross) was used as a field sign in the medieval period without any connection to Saint Andrew. The connection between the field sign and the legendary mode of crucifixion of the saint may originate in Scotland, in the late 14th century. The Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that every Scottish and French soldier (fighting against the English under Richard II) &quot;shall have a sign before and behind, namely a white St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross&quot;.

James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas at the Battle of Otterburn (1388) reportedly used a pennon with a saltire at the hoist. Similarly, white saltire was shown in the canton of the &quot;Blue Blanket of the Trades of Edinburgh&quot;, reputedly made by Queen Margaret, wife of James III (1451–1488). This is the flag of the Incorporated Trades of Edinburgh, and the focal point of the Riding of the Marches ceremony held in the city each year.

Use of the white &quot;Sanct Androis cors&quot; on blue as a naval flag is recorded for 1507, for the carrack &quot;Great Michael&quot;. As a heraldic flag, the white saltire on a blue field is first shown in 1542, in the armorial of David Lyndsay. Here, the royal arms are supported by two unicorns, each holding the saltire banner.

==Protocol==
===Use by the Scottish Government===

The Scottish Government has ruled that the Saltire should, where possible, fly on all its buildings every day from 8am until sunset. An exception is made for United Kingdom &quot;national days&quot;, when on buildings where only one flagpole is present the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the Union Flag. Such flag days are standard throughout the United Kingdom, with the exception of Merchant Navy Day (3 September) which is a specific flag day in Scotland during which the Red Ensign of the Merchant Navy may be flown on land in place of either the Saltire or Union Flag.

A further Scottish distinction from the UK flag days is that on Saint Andrew&#x27;s Day (30 November) the Union Flag will only be flown where a building has more than one flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country&#x27;s national day. In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew&#x27;s Day. Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo. For example, Safer Scotland&#x27;s emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.

===Use by military institutions on land===

The seven British Army Infantry battalions of the Scottish Division, plus the Scots Guards and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards regiments, use the Saltire in a variety of forms. Combat and transport vehicles of these Army units may be adorned with a small, (130x80mm approx.), representation of the Saltire; such decals being displayed on the front and/or rear of the vehicle (on tanks these may also be displayed on the vehicle turret). In Iraq, during both Operation Granby and the subsequent Operation Telic, the Saltire was seen to be flown from the communications whip antenna of vehicles belonging to these units. Funerals, conducted with full military honours, of casualties of these operations in Iraq, plus those killed in operations in Afghanistan, have also been seen to include the Saltire being draped over the coffin of the deceased on such occasions.

In the battle for &quot;hearts and minds&quot; in Iraq, the Saltire was again used by the British Army as a means of distinguishing troops belonging to Scottish regiments from other coalition forces, in the hope of fostering better relations with the civilian population in the area south west of Baghdad. Leaflets were distributed to Iraqi civilians, by members of the Black Watch, depicting troops and vehicles set against a backdrop of the Saltire.

Immediately prior to, and following, the merger in March 2006 of Scotland&#x27;s historic infantry regiments to form a single Royal Regiment of Scotland, a multi-million-pound advertising campaign was launched in Scotland in an attempt to attract recruits to join the reorganised and simultaneously rebranded &quot;Scottish Infantry&quot;. The recruitment campaign employed the Saltire in the form of a logo; the words &quot;Scottish Infantry. Forward As One.&quot; being placed next to a stylised image of the Saltire. For the duration of the campaign, this logo was used in conjunction with the traditional Army recruiting logo; the words &quot;Army. Be The Best.&quot; being placed beneath a stylised representation of the Union Flag. Despite this multi-media campaign having had mixed results in terms of overall success, the Saltire continues to appear on a variety of Army recruiting media used in Scotland.

Other uses of the Saltire by the Army include the cap badge design of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which consists of a (silver) Saltire, surmounted by a (gilt) lion rampant and ensigned with a representation of the Crown of Scotland (this same design, save for the Crown, is used on both the Regimental flag and tactical recognition flash of the Royal Regiment of Scotland). The badge of the No. 679 (The Duke of Connaught&#x27;s) Squadron Army Air Corps bears a Saltire between two wreaths ensigned &#x27;Scottish Horse&#x27;, an honour they received in 1971 which originated through their links with the Royal Artillery. The Officer Training Corps units attached to universities in Edinburgh and Glasgow, plus the Tayforth University OTC, all feature the Saltire in their cap badge designs.

The Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy adorned three of their aircraft with the Saltire. Specifically, the Westland Sea King Mk5 aircraft of HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;, operating in the Search and Rescue (SAR) role from Royal Naval Air Station Prestwick, Ayrshire, displayed a Saltire decal on the nose of each aircraft.

Although not represented in the form of a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion rampant as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. The crest of the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire, however, unlike Leuchars, this sword was shown inverted and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle&#x27;s head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions rampant.

===General use===
In Scotland, the Saltire can be flown at any time by any individual, company, local authority, hospital or school without obtaining express consent. Many local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire from Council Buildings. However, in 2007 Angus Council approved a proposal to replace the Saltire on Council Buildings with a new Angus flag, based on the council&#x27;s coat of arms. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council&#x27;s move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on council buildings.

In the United Kingdom, owners of vehicles registered in Great Britain have the option of displaying the Saltire on the vehicle registration plate, in conjunction with the letters &quot;SCO&quot; or alternatively the word &quot;Scotland&quot;. In 1999, the Royal Mail issued a series of pictorial stamps for Scotland, with the &#x27;2nd&#x27; value stamp depicting the Flag of Scotland. In Northern Ireland, sections of the Protestant community routinely employ the Saltire as a means of demonstrating and celebrating their Ulster-Scots heritage.

 Use of the Saltire at sea as a &quot;Jack&quot; or &quot;courtesy flag&quot; has been observed, including as a &quot;Jack&quot; on the Scottish Government&#x27;s Marine Patrol Vessel (MPV) &quot;Jura&quot;. The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a &quot;Jack&quot; on vessels which have a bow staff, including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating in and around the Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire, for use as a &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;courtesy flag&quot;, may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag M, &quot;MIKE&quot;, which is used to indicate &quot;My vessel is stopped; making no way.&quot; For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire, thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine, a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century, the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.

==Incorporation into the Union Flag==

The Saltire is one of the key components of the Union Flag which, since its creation in 1606, has appeared in various forms following the Flag of Scotland and Flag of England first being merged to mark the Union of the Crowns, an event occurred in 1603 when James VI, King of Scots, acceded to the thrones of both England and Ireland upon the death of Elizabeth I of England. The proclamation by King James, made on 12 April 1606, which led to the creation of the Union Flag states:

However, in objecting strongly to the form and pattern of Union Flag designed by the College of Arms and approved by King James, whereby the cross of Saint George surmounted that of Saint Andrew, regarded in Scotland as a slight upon the Scottish nation, a great number of shipmasters and ship-owners in Scotland took up the matter with John Erskine, 19th Earl of Mar, and encouraged him to send a letter of complaint, dated 7 August 1606, to James VI, via the Privy Council of Scotland, stating:

Despite the drawings described in this letter as showing drafts of the two new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, this design is considered by most vexillologists to have been &quot;unofficial&quot;, there is reason to believe that such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag&#x27;s design is also described in the 1704 edition of &quot;The Present State of the Universe&quot; by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix &quot;The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World&quot;.

On land, evidence suggesting use of this flag appears in the depiction of Edinburgh Castle by John Slezer, in his series of engravings entitled &quot;Theatrum Scotiae&quot;, . Appearing in later editions of &quot;Theatrum Scotiae&quot;, the &quot;North East View of Edinburgh Castle&quot; engraving depicts the &quot;Scotch&quot; (to use the appropriate adjective of that period) version of the Union Flag flying from the Castle Clock Tower. 

A reduced view of this engraving, with the flag similarly detailed, also appears on the &quot;Plan of Edenburgh, Exactly Done&quot;. However, on the engraving entitled &quot;North Prospect of the City of Edenburgh&quot; the detail of the flag, when compared to the aforementioned engravings, appears indistinct and lacks any element resembling a saltire. The reduced version of the &quot;North Prospect ...&quot;, as shown on the &quot;Plan of Edenburgh, Exactly Done&quot;, does however display the undivided arm of a saltire and is thereby suggestive of the Scottish variant.

On 17 April 1707, just two weeks prior to the Acts of Union coming into effect, Sir Henry St George, Garter King of Arms, presented several designs to Queen Anne and her Privy Council for consideration as the flag of the soon to be unified Kingdom of Great Britain. At the request of the Scots representatives, the designs for consideration included that version of Union Flag showing the Cross of Saint Andrew uppermost; identified as being the &quot;Scots union flagg as said to be used by the Scots&quot;. However, Queen Anne and her Privy Council approved Sir Henry&#x27;s original effort (pattern &quot;one&quot;) showing the Cross of Saint George uppermost.

From 1801, in order to symbolise the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland a new design, which included the St Patrick&#x27;s Cross, was adopted for the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. A manuscript compiled from 1785 by William Fox, and in possession of the Flag Research Center, includes a full plate showing &quot;the scoth union&quot; flag with the addition of the cross of St. Patrick. This could imply that there was still some insistence on a Scottish variant after 1801.

Despite its unofficial and historic status the Scottish Union Flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers, and its unofficial use by private citizens on land has been observed. In 2006 historian David R. Ross called for Scotland to once again adopt this design in order to &quot;reflect separate national identities across the UK&quot;. However, the 1801 design of the Union Flag remains the official flag of the entire United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

Several flags outside of the United Kingdom are based on the Scottish saltire. In Canada, an inverse representation of the flag (i.e. a blue saltire on a white field), combined with the shield from the royal arms of the Kingdom of Scotland, forms the modern flag of the province of Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia (Latin for &quot;New Scotland&quot;) was the first colonial venture of the Kingdom of Scotland in the Americas. By contrast, the saltire logo of St. Andrew&#x27;s First Aid is red on white rather than white on blue, in alteration of the Red Cross. Also, the Colombian department of the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina uses a pale-blue version because the name of principal island (&quot;San Andrés&quot;, Saint Andrew), though also by the first settlers from Scottish origin.

The Dutch municipality of Sint-Oedenrode, named after the Scottish princess Saint Oda, uses a version of the flag of Scotland, defaced with a gold castle having on both sides a battlement.

==Royal Standard of Scotland==


The &quot;Royal Standard of Scotland&quot;, also known as the &quot;Banner of the King of Scots&quot; or more commonly the &quot;Lion Rampant of Scotland&quot;, is the Scottish Royal Banner of Arms. Used historically by the King of Scots, the Royal Standard of Scotland differs from Scotland&#x27;s national flag, the Saltire, in that its correct use is restricted by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland to only a few Great Officers of State who officially represent The Sovereign in Scotland. However, a 1934 Royal Warrant for George V&#x27;s silver jubilee which authorised waving of hand-held versions continues to be relied upon by fans at sports events and other public occasions. It is also used in an official capacity at Royal residences in Scotland when the Sovereign is not present.

==In Unicode==
In 2017, the Unicode Consortium approved emoji support for the flag of Scotland, alongside the flags of England and Wales, in Unicode version 10.0 and Emoji version 5.0. This was following a proposal from Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia and Owen Williams of BBC Wales in March 2016, 

The flag is implemented using the regional indicator symbol sequence , so 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 requires a total of 7 code points: . Prior to this update, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that users had &quot;been able to send emojis of the Union Flag, but not of the individual nations&quot;.

<text>Máiréad &quot;Peig&quot; Sayers (; 29 March 18738 December 1958) was an Irish author and seanchaí ( ) born in Dún Chaoin, County Kerry, Ireland. Seán Ó Súilleabháin, the former Chief archivist for the Irish Folklore Commission, described her as &quot;one of the greatest woman storytellers of recent times&quot;.

==Biography==

=== Youth ===

She was born Máiréad Sayers in the townland of Vicarstown, Dunquin, Corca Dhuibhne, County Kerry, the youngest child of the family. She was called Peig after her mother, Margaret &quot;Peig&quot; Brosnan, from Castleisland. Her father Tomás Sayers was a locally renowned expert on the oral tradition and passed on many of his tales to Peig.

Through her father&#x27;s influence, Peig also grew up upon a rich oral tradition of Irish folklore, mythology, and local history, including local folk heroes like Piaras Feiritéar, faction fights at pattern days and market fairs before the Great Famine, and the lingering memory of Mass rocks and priest hunters under the Penal Laws. The custom of &quot;bothántaíocht&quot; (people visiting neighbours at night to swap news and stories) was strong and Peig’s brother Sean used to bring her along, and Peig heard and remembered a large number of stories about the past. Peig was very sociable and enjoyed the company of older people as well as girls her own age.

At the age of 12, she was taken out of the National school and went to work as a domestic servant for the Curran family in the nearby town of Dingle. The Currans were members of the growing Irish Catholic middle class produced by the Government-funded breakup and sale of the Anglo-Irish landlords&#x27; estates after the Land War. Peig later recalled that the Curran family were kind employers and treated her very well. The Curran children, however, were forbidden by their parents, who desired for them to move up in the world, to learn the Irish language and so, at the children&#x27;s request, Peig taught the local vernacular to them in secret.

After she grew to adulthood, Peig was promised during the &quot;American wake&quot; of her childhood best friend, Cáit Boland, that Peig would soon join her as part of the Irish diaspora in the United States. Cáit later wrote, however, that she had had an accident and could not forward the cost of Peig&#x27;s passage.

=== Island Life ===
Instead, Peig moved to the Great Blasket Island after her brother arranged for her to marry Pádraig Ó Guithín, a fisherman and native of the island, nine years her senior, on 13 February 1892. Pádraig and Peig had eleven children, of whom only six survived their mother. Three died in infancy, and an eight year old girl, Siobhán, died from measles.

Norwegian linguist and Celticist Carl Marstrander stayed on the island while studying the Corca Dhuibhne dialect of Munster Irish in 1907 and later persuaded Robin Flower of the British Museum to similarly visit the Blaskets. Flower was keenly appreciative of Peig Sayers&#x27; storytelling skills. He recorded her and brought her stories to the attention of the academic world.

After the Easter Rising of 1916, Peig hung up a framed picture of the 16 executed Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army leaders in the family&#x27;s cottage in Great Blasket island. During a search of the island by the Black and Tans during the subsequent Irish War of Independence, a terrified Pádraig Ó Guithín ordered his wife to take the picture down before she got them all killed. Even though Peig indignantly refused, the search party did not harm anyone in their family.

Pádraig Ó Guithín died in April 1923. The remaining children, like many islanders, emigrated to America. Last to leave was Mícheál, called &#x27;an File’ (The Poet), who sailed in 1929. From then on Peig lived only with her elderly, partially blind brother-in-law, Mícheál.

During the 1930s a Dublin teacher, Máire Ní Chinnéide, who was also a regular visitor to the Blaskets, urged Peig to tell her life story to her son Mícheál. Peig was illiterate in the Irish language, having received her early schooling only through the medium of English. She dictated her biography to Mícheál, who then sent the manuscript pages to Máire Ní Chinnéide in Dublin. Ní Chinnéide then edited the manuscript for its publication in 1936.

Over several years from 1938 Peig dictated 350 ancient legends, ghost stories, folktales, and religious stories to Seosamh Ó Dálaigh of the Irish Folklore Commission (while another source tallies 432 items collected by Ó Dálaigh from her, some 5,000 pages of material). Peig had a vast repertoire of tales, ranging from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology to romantic and supernatural stories.

Final Years

She continued to live on the island until 1942, when she returned to her native place, Dunquin, to live with her son, Mícheál, because there was nobody to look after her in her old age on the island.

Peig lost her eyesight in the late 1940s. She travelled to Dublin for the first time in 1952 at the age of 81 years, having required hospital treatment there.

She later moved to a hospital in Dingle, County Kerry where she died on 8 December 1958 at the age of 85 years. She is buried in the Dún Chaoin Burial Ground, Corca Dhuibhne, Ireland. All her surviving children except Mícheál emigrated to the United States to live with their descendants in Springfield, Massachusetts.

==Books==

Sayers is most famous for her autobiography &quot;Peig&quot; (), but also for the folklore and stories which were recorded in (&quot;An Old Woman&#x27;s Reflections&quot;, ). The books were not written down by Peig, but were dictated to others.

Sayers&#x27; memoir &quot;Peig&quot; describes her childhood immersed in traditional Munster Irish-speaking culture, which was still surviving despite rackrenting Anglo-Irish landlords, the resulting extreme poverty, and the coercive Anglicisation of the educational system. Another theme was devout Catholicism and mass emigration to the New World following a ceremonial ceilidh called an &quot;American wake&quot;.

Even though Peig Sayers&#x27; memoir at first received high praise, Máire Ní Chinnéide has since received very harsh criticism and accusations of censorship. Máire Ní Chinnéide did so, however, to make Peig&#x27;s life story conform to the idealised vision of the Irish peasantry favoured by the ruling Fianna Fáil political party, which owed more to 19th century Romantic nationalism than to the reality of daily life or the culture of the Gaeltachtaí.

One matter of speculation is whether there was delicate material that a female informant such as she would have refrained from recounting to a male collector (Irish Folklore Commission&#x27;s policy being to hire only male collectors), though there was evidently close rapport established between the two individuals, which perhaps overrode such hypothetical barriers. She was also among the informants not comfortable with being recorded mechanically on the Ediphone, so the material had to be taken down on pen and paper.

In the 1966 University of Chicago volume &quot;Folktales of Ireland&quot;, three uncensored folktales collected from Peig Sayers, as translated by Seán Ó Súilleabháin, appeared in English for the first time.

===&quot;Peig&quot;===

&quot;Peig&quot; is among the most famous expressions of a late Gaelic Revival genre of personal histories by and about inhabitants of the Blasket Islands and other remote Gaeltacht locations. Tomás Ó Criomhthain&#x27;s similarly censored memoir (&quot;the Islandman&quot;, 1929) and Muiris Ó Súilleabháin&#x27;s , and Robert J. Flaherty&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Man of Aran&quot; address similar subjects.

The often bleak tone of the book is established from its opening words:

Ironically, the standard cliches of Peig&#x27;s memoirs and those censored similarly to hers swiftly found themselves the object of contempt and mockery – especially among the cosmopolitan middle class intelligentsia and the often covertly literary Irish civil service – for their often extremely depressing accounts of rural poverty, starvation, family tragedies, and bereavements. In Modern literature in Irish, mockery of the Gaeltacht memoir genre reached its peak with Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s parody of ; the novel (&quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;).

Despite this fact, Peig&#x27;s book was widely used as a text for teaching and examining Irish in many secondary schools. As a book with arguably sombre and depressing themes and its latter half cataloguing a string of heartbreaking family tragedies, its presence on the Irish syllabus has often been harshly criticised.

It led, for example, to the following comment from Progressive Democrat Seanadóir John Minihan in the Seanad Éireann in 2006 when discussing improvements to the curriculum:

According to Blasket Islands literary scholar Cole Moreton, however, this was not Peig&#x27;s fault, but that of her censors, &quot;Some of her stories were very funny, some savage, some wise, some earthy; but very few made it into the pages of her autobiography. The words were dictated to her son, then edited by the wife of a Dublin school inspector, and both collaborators sanitized the text a little in turn so that it was homely and pious, a book fit to be taken up as a set text in Irish schools. The image of Peig&#x27;s broad face smiling out from beneath a headscarf, hands clasped in her lap, became familiar to generations of schoolchildren who were bored rigid by this holy peasant woman who had been forced upon them. They grew up loathing Peig... without hearing the stories as they were intended.&quot;

&quot;Peig&quot; was eventually replaced by Maidhc Dainín Ó Sé&#x27;s &quot;A Thig Ná Tit Orm&quot; during the mid-1990s.

==Popular culture==
In &quot;Paddywhackery&quot;, a television show from 2007 on the Irish language on television channel TG4, Fionnula Flanagan plays the ghost of Peig Sayers, sent to Dublin to restore faith in the Irish language revival.

A stage play, &quot;Peig: The Musical!&quot; (co-written by Julian Gough, Gary MacSweeney and the &quot;Flying Pig Comedy Troupe&quot;) was also loosely based on Peig&#x27;s autobiography.

<doc id="179293" wikidata="Q695405" url="?curid=179293" title="Rumours (album)">
<text>Rumours is the eleventh studio album by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 4 February 1977, by Warner Bros. Records. Largely recorded in California in 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. The recording sessions took place as the band members dealt with breakups and struggled with heavy drug use, both of which shaped the album&#x27;s direction and lyrics.

Recorded with the intention of making &quot;a pop album&quot; that would expand on the commercial success of the 1975 album &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, &quot;Rumours&quot; contains a mix of electric and acoustic instrumentation, accented rhythms, guitars, and keyboards. Its lyrics concern personal and often troubled relationships. Its release was postponed by delays in the mixing process. The band promoted the album with a worldwide concert tour.

&quot;Rumours&quot; became the band&#x27;s first number-one album on the UK Albums Chart and also topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It received multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, Denmark, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. As of February 2023, &quot;Rumours&quot; had sold over 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums of all time. All of its four singles—&quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, and &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;—reached the top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, with &quot;Dreams&quot; reaching number one. In 2004, &quot;Rumours&quot; was remastered and reissued, with the addition of the track &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and outtakes from the recording sessions. 

The album garnered widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its production quality and the vocal harmonies of the band&#x27;s three singers, and won Album of the Year at the 1978 Grammy Awards. Often considered Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s magnum opus and one of the greatest albums of all time, &quot;Rumours&quot; was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003. The album was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2017 by the Library of Congress, which deemed it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rumours&quot; ranked seventh in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==
After the guitarist Bob Welch left Fleetwood Mac in 1974, the drummer Mick Fleetwood, the keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, and the bassist John McVie were joined by the guitarist and singer Lindsey Buckingham and the singer Stevie Nicks. In July 1975, Fleetwood Mac released its eponymous tenth album to great commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the U.S. in 1976; the record&#x27;s singles &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; all reached the Top 20 there.

But the band&#x27;s success belied turmoil amongst its members. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo&#x27;s arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, was having an affair with his best friend.

Press intrusions into the band members&#x27; lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to have been in the hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood&#x27;s daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a tenth anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change its lineup, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the &quot;tremendous emotional sacrifices&quot; made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Fleetwood and John McVie fired their producer Keith Olsen because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band&#x27;s interests.

==Recording==

In February 1976, Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, with the engineers Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. The three parties shared production duties, while the more technically adept Caillat was responsible for most of the engineering; he took a leave of absence from Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles on the premise that Fleetwood Mac would eventually use their facilities. The set-up in Sausalito included several small recording rooms in a large, windowless, wooden building. Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city&#x27;s harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio&#x27;s lodge in the adjacent hills. Recording occurred in a room equipped with a 3M 24-track tape machine, a range of high-quality microphones, and an API mixing console with 550A equalisers; the latter were used to control frequency differences or a track&#x27;s timbre. Although Caillat was impressed with the set-up, he felt that the room lacked ambience because of its &quot;very dead speakers&quot; and large amounts of soundproofing.

The record&#x27;s working title in Sausalito was &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Gone&quot;. Buckingham took charge of the studio sessions to make &quot;a pop album&quot;. According to Dashut, while Fleetwood and the McVies came from an improvisational blues rock background, the guitarist understood &quot;the craft of record making&quot;. During the formative stages of compositions, Buckingham and Christine McVie played guitar and piano together to create the album&#x27;s basic structures. The latter was the only classically trained musician in Fleetwood Mac, but both shared a similar sense of musicality. When the band jammed, Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio&#x27;s partition screen to better gauge Caillat&#x27;s and Dashut&#x27;s reactions to the music&#x27;s groove. Baffles were placed around the drums and around John McVie, who played his bass guitar facing Fleetwood. Buckingham performed close to the rhythm section, while Christine McVie&#x27;s keyboards were kept away from the drum kit. Caillat and Dashut spent about nine days working with a range of microphones and amplifiers to get a larger sound, before discovering they could adjust the sound effectively on the API mixing console.

As the studio sessions progressed, the band members&#x27; new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started to have a negative effect on Fleetwood Mac. The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant. At the time, the hippie movement still affected Sausalito&#x27;s culture and drugs were readily available. Open-ended budgets enabled the band and the engineers to become self-indulgent; sleepless nights and the extensive use of cocaine marked much of the album&#x27;s production. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant&#x27;s owners, indicated in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought &quot;excess at its most excessive&quot; by taking over the studio for long and extremely expensive sessions; he stated, &quot;The band would come in at 7 at night, have a big feast, party till 1 or 2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn&#x27;t do anything, they&#x27;d start recording&quot;.
Nicks has suggested that Fleetwood Mac created the best music when in the worst shape, while, according to Buckingham, the tensions between band members formed the recording process and led to &quot;the whole being more than the sum of the parts&quot;. The couple&#x27;s work became &quot;bittersweet&quot; after their final split, although Buckingham still had a skill for taking Nicks&#x27; tracks and &quot;making them beautiful&quot;. The vocal harmonies between the duo and Christine McVie worked well and were captured using the best microphones available. Nicks&#x27; lyrical focus allowed the instrumentals in the songs that she wrote to be looser and more abstract. According to Dashut, all the recordings captured &quot;emotion and feeling without a middle man ... or tempering&quot;. John McVie tended to clash with Buckingham about the make-up of songs, but both admit to achieving good outcomes. Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Songbird&quot;, which Caillat felt needed a concert hall&#x27;s ambience, was recorded during an all-night session at Zellerbach Auditorium in Berkeley, across San Francisco Bay from Sausalito.

Following over two months in Sausalito, Fleetwood arranged a ten-day tour to give the band a break and get fan feedback. After the concerts, recording resumed at venues in Los Angeles, including Wally Heider Studios. Christine McVie and Nicks did not attend most of the sessions and took time off until they were needed to record any remaining vocals. The rest of Fleetwood Mac, with Caillat and Dashut, struggled to finalise the overdubbing and mixing of &quot;Rumours&quot; after the Sausalito tapes were damaged by repeated use during recording; the kick and snare drum audio tracks sounded &quot;lifeless&quot;. A sell-out autumn tour of the US was cancelled to allow the completion of the album, whose scheduled release date of September 1976 was pushed back. A specialist was hired to rectify the Sausalito tapes using a vari-speed oscillator. Through a pair of headphones which played the damaged tapes in his left ear and the safety master recordings in his right, he converged their respective speeds aided by the timings provided by the snare and hi-hat audio tracks. Fleetwood Mac and their co-producers wanted a &quot;no-filler&quot; final product, in which every track seemed a potential single. After the final mastering stage and hearing the songs back-to-back, the band members sensed they had recorded something &quot;pretty powerful&quot;.

==Composition==
===Lyrics===
Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s main songwriters—Buckingham, Christine McVie, and Nicks—worked individually on songs but sometimes shared lyrics. &quot;The Chain&quot; is the only track on which all members, including Fleetwood and John McVie, collaborated. All songs on &quot;Rumours&quot; concern personal, often troubled relationships. According to Christine McVie, the fact that the lyricists were focusing on the various separations became apparent to the band only in hindsight. &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; is about her boyfriend, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s lighting director, whom she dated after splitting from John. Nicks&#x27; &quot;Dreams&quot; details a breakup and has a hopeful message, while Buckingham&#x27;s similar effort in &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; is more pessimistic. After a short fling with a New England woman, he was inspired to write &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;, a song about the illusion of thinking that sadness will never occur again once content with life.
&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot;, written by Christine McVie, is a song about optimism. She noted that Buckingham helped her craft the verses because their personal sensibilities overlapped. McVie&#x27;s next track, &quot;Songbird&quot;, features more introspective lyrics about &quot;nobody and everybody&quot; in the form of &quot;a little prayer&quot;. &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;, the last McVie song on the album, was written about Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd, who had just got back together. The band&#x27;s nickname for Fleetwood was &quot;the Big Daddy&quot;. McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer&#x27;s direction for Fleetwood Mac, which always turned out to be right. Nicks&#x27; song &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; is inspired by Los Angeles and the hardship encountered in such a city. After struggling with the rock lifestyle, Nicks became addicted to cocaine; the lyrics address her belief in &quot;keeping going&quot;.

===Music===
Featuring a soft rock and pop rock sound, &quot;Rumours&quot; is built around a mix of acoustic and electric instrumentation. Buckingham&#x27;s guitar work and Christine McVie&#x27;s use of Fender Rhodes piano or Hammond B-3 organ are present on all but two tracks. The record often includes stressed drum sounds and distinctive percussion such as congas and maracas. It opens with &quot;Second Hand News&quot;, originally an acoustic demo titled &quot;Strummer&quot;. After hearing Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;Jive Talkin&#x27;&quot;, Buckingham and co-producer Dashut built up the song with four audio tracks of electric guitar and the use of chair percussion to evoke Celtic rock. &quot;Dreams&quot; includes &quot;ethereal spaces&quot; and a recurring two note pattern on the bass guitar. Nicks wrote the song in an afternoon and led the vocals, while the band played around her. The third track on &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;, began as &quot;Brushes&quot;, a simple acoustic guitar tune played by Buckingham, with snare rolls by Fleetwood using brushes; the band added vocals and further instrumental audio tracks to make it more layered. Inspired by triple step dancing patterns, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop&quot; includes both conventional acoustic and tack piano. In the latter instrument, nails are placed on the points where the hammers hit the strings, producing a more percussive sound. &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; is more guitar-oriented and has a four-to-the-floor dance beat influenced by The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot;. The album&#x27;s pace slows down with &quot;Songbird&quot;, conceived solely by Christine McVie using a nine-foot Steinway piano.

Side two of &quot;Rumours&quot; begins with &quot;The Chain&quot;, one of the record&#x27;s most complicated compositions. A Christine McVie demo, &quot;Keep Me There&quot;, and a Nicks song were re-cut in the studio and were heavily edited to form parts of the track. The whole of the band crafted the rest using an approach akin to creating a film score; John McVie provided a prominent solo using a fretless bass guitar, which marked a speeding up in tempo and the start of the song&#x27;s final third. Inspired by R&amp;B, &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot; has a simpler composition and features a clavinet, a special type of keyboard instrument, while the rhythm section plays interlocking notes and beats. The ninth track on &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot;, makes use of a twelve string guitar and harmonising vocals. Influenced by the music of Buddy Holly, Buckingham and Nicks created it in 1974 before they were in Fleetwood Mac. &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; was crafted spontaneously and includes improvised bass guitar patterns from John McVie and keyboard blips from Christine McVie. The album ends with &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;, a song inspired by free jazz, which has music from a harpsichord, a Fender Stratocaster guitar, and a dobro, an acoustic guitar whose sound is produced by one or more metal cones.

==Promotion and release==

In Autumn 1976, while still recording, Fleetwood Mac showcased tracks from &quot;Rumours&quot; at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles. John McVie suggested the album title to the band because he felt the members were writing &quot;journals and diaries&quot; about each other through music. Warner Bros. confirmed the release details to the press in December and chose &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot; as a December 1976 promotional single. The label&#x27;s aggressive marketing of 1975&#x27;s &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;, in which links with dozens of FM and AM radio stations were formed across America, aided the promotion of &quot;Rumours&quot;. At the time, the album&#x27;s advance order of 800,000 copies was the largest in Warner Bros.&#x27; history.

&quot;Rumours&quot; was released on 4 February 1977 in the US, and a week later in the UK. The front cover features a stylised shot of Fleetwood and Nicks dressed in her &quot;Rhiannon&quot; stage persona, while the back has a montage of band portraits; all the photographs were taken by Herbert Worthington. On 28 February 1977, after rehearsing at SIR Studios in Los Angeles, Fleetwood Mac embarked on the Rumours Tour, which visited North America, Europe, Oceania and Asia. Nicks has noted that, after performing mostly &quot;Rumours&quot; songs during gigs, the band initially encountered poor reception from fans who were not accustomed to the new material. A one-off March performance at a benefit concert for United States Senator Birch Bayh in Indiana was followed by a short tour of the UK, the Netherlands, France, and Germany in April. Nigel Williamson of &quot;Uncut&quot; called Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s performances &quot;rock&#x27;s greatest soap opera&quot;. &quot;Dreams&quot;, released in March 1977, became the band&#x27;s only number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that June.

=== Deluxe edition ===
&quot;Rumours&quot; was reissued on 28 January 2013 as a six-disc super deluxe edition box set, for the album&#x27;s 35th anniversary. The set included four CDs that were divided into: a remastered version of the original album that features &quot;Silver Springs&quot;; a dozen unreleased live recordings from the 1977 &quot;Rumours&quot; world tour; sixteen new and unreleased tracks from the album&#x27;s recording sessions, titled &quot;More From The Recording Sessions&quot;; and another eighteen session tracks, previously found on the 2004 reissue of the album, titled as &quot;Recording Sessions, Roughs &amp; Outtakes&quot;. The last two discs were a 140-gram gatefold vinyl edition of the album and a DVD of &quot;The Rosebud Film&quot;, a documentary created by Michael Collins to promote the European leg of the &quot;Rumours&quot; tour, with behind-the-scenes interviews, rehearsal footage and live performances.

Among the extra content on discs three and four, two different demos of &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; were featured. Written by Nicks in 1976 during the recording of &quot;Rumours&quot; about her breakup with Buckingham, the song was rehearsed for the album but never recorded. A new version would officially be released on Nicks&#x27; 2001 solo album, &quot;Trouble in Shangri-La&quot;. Another Nicks-penned demo, &quot;Think About It&quot;, was included on disc four. Written in 1975 and dedicated to Christine McVie, the finished recording would end up on her 1981 album, &quot;Bella Donna&quot;.

=== &quot;Rumours Live&quot; ===

On 8 September 2023 Fleetwood Mac released a live album from the Rumours Tour, titled &quot;Rumours Live&quot;. Recorded by Ken Caillat on the band&#x27;s opening night at The Forum on 29 August 1977, its setlist was mostly taken from &quot;&quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;&quot; and &quot;Rumours&quot;, except for 1969&#x27;s &quot;Oh Well&quot;. The live recording of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; appeared as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of &quot;Live&quot;, but the show&#x27;s other seventeen tracks had previously been unreleased.

&quot;Rumours Live&quot; was issued in two physical formats: a two-CD set, and a double-LP gatefold edition, pressed on 180g black vinyl, with lacquers cut by Chris Bellman at Bernie Grundman Mastering. A clear vinyl version of the LPs was also available.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rumours&quot; has been acclaimed by music critics since its release. Robert Christgau, reviewing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, described it as &quot;more consistent and more eccentric&quot; than its predecessor. He added that it &quot;jumps right out of the speakers at you&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album&#x27;s most pleasing elements; he stated, &quot;Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record, &quot;Rumours&quot; proves that the success of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; was no fluke.&quot; In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Rockwell said the album is &quot;a delightful disk, and one hopes the public thinks so, too&quot;, while Dave Marsh of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; claimed the songs are &quot;as grandly glossy as anything right now&quot;. Robert Hilburn was less receptive and called &quot;Rumours&quot; a &quot;frustratingly uneven&quot; record in his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, while Juan Rodriguez of &quot;The Gazette&quot; suggested that, while the music is &quot;crisper and clearer&quot;, Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s ideas are &quot;slightly more muddled&quot;. The album finished fourth in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1977 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.

In a retrospective review, AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave &quot;Rumours&quot; five stars and noted that, regardless of the voyeuristic element, the record was &quot;an unparalleled blockbuster&quot; because of the music&#x27;s quality; he concluded, &quot;Each tune, each phrase regains its raw, immediate emotional power—which is why &quot;Rumours&quot; touched a nerve upon its 1977 release, and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest, most compelling pop albums of all time.&quot; According to &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Barry Walsh, Fleetwood Mac drew on romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil to create a timeless, five-star record, while Andy Gill of &quot;The Independent&quot; claimed it &quot;represents, along with &quot;The Eagles Greatest Hits&quot;, the high-water mark of America&#x27;s Seventies rock-culture expansion, the quintessence of a counter-cultural mindset lured into coke-fuelled hedonism&quot;. In 2007, the BBC&#x27;s Daryl Easlea labelled the sonic results as &quot;near perfect&quot;, &quot;like a thousand angels kissing you sweetly on the forehead&quot;, while Patrick McKay of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;What distinguishes &quot;Rumours&quot;—what makes it art—is the contradiction between its cheerful surface and its anguished heart. Here is a radio-friendly record about anger, recrimination, and loss.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Rumours&quot; was a huge commercial success and became Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s second US number-one record, following the 1975 eponymous release. It stayed at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 31 non-consecutive weeks, while also reaching number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. It re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number 11 in May 2011, and the Australian ARIA chart at number 2, after several songs from the album were used for the &quot;Rumours&quot; episode of the American TV series &quot;Glee&quot;. It re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 top ten in October 2020 in the wake of a viral TikTok by Nathan Apodaca which showed him skateboarding while &quot;Dreams&quot; played, even prompting Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham to create similar videos. The album was certified platinum in America and the UK within months of release after one million units and 300,000 units were shipped, respectively. All three major US trade publications—&quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Cash Box&quot;, and &quot;Record World&quot;—named it Album of the Year for 1977. After a debut at number seven, &quot;Rumours&quot; peaked at the top of the UK Albums Chart in January 1978, becoming Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s first number one album in the country. In February, the band and co-producers Caillat and Dashut won the 1978 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. By March, the album had sold over 10 million copies worldwide, including over eight million in the US alone.

By 1980, 13 million copies of &quot;Rumours&quot; had been sold worldwide. As of 2017, sales were over 40 million copies. , &quot;Rumours&quot; has spent over 1,000 weeks in the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart. It is the 11th-best-selling album in UK history, and is certified 14× platinum by the British Phonographic Industry, the equivalent of 4.2 million units shipped. The record has received a Diamond Award from the Recording Industry Association of America for a 20× platinum certification or 20 million copies shipped, making it, , tied for the 11th-highest certified album in US history (by number of copies shipped). &quot;Rumours&quot; was the UK&#x27;s bestselling album on vinyl during 2020, with the Official Charts Company confirming 32,500 annual sales in the format.

==Legacy==
Mick Fleetwood has called &quot;Rumours&quot; &quot;the most important album we ever made&quot;, because its success allowed the group to continue recording for years to come. Pop culture journalist Chuck Klosterman links the record&#x27;s sales figures to its &quot;really likable songs&quot; but suggests that &quot;no justification for greatness&quot; is intrinsically provided by them. In 1997, &quot;The Guardian&quot; surveyed renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs, who placed the record at number 78 in the list of the 100 Best Albums Ever. In 1998, Fleetwood produced and released &quot;Legacy: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Rumours&quot;, an album that consisted of one cover of each song off &quot;Rumours&quot; by an act influenced by it, including alternative rock bands Tonic, Matchbox 20, and Goo Goo Dolls; Celtic rock groups The Corrs and The Cranberries; and singer-songwriters Elton John, Duncan Sheik, and Jewel.

Other acts influenced by &quot;Rumours&quot; include baroque pop artist Tori Amos, hard rock group Saliva, indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, and art pop singer Lorde, who called it a &quot;perfect record&quot;.

&quot;Rumours&quot; has frequently been considered one of the greatest albums of all time. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003, In 1998, &quot;Q&quot; placed it at number three—behind The Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; and Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;—in its list of 50 Best Albums of the 70s. In 1999, &quot;Vibe&quot; featured it as one of 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. In 2001, VH1 ranked the record at number 16 during its 100 Greatest Albums countdown, while &quot;Slant&quot; included it as one of 50 Essential Pop Albums. The same year, &quot;USA Today&quot; placed &quot;Rumours&quot; at number 23 in its Top 40 Albums list, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 25 in its special issue of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, in 2003, the highest Fleetwood Mac placement, number 26 in a 2012 revised list, and number 7 in the 2020 and 2023 lists. In 2000, it was voted number 31 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named it in its All-TIME 100 Albums shortlist, while &quot;Mojo&quot; featured it in its unnumbered list of 70 from the 1970s: Decade&#x27;s Greatest Albums. The record is included in both &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die&quot; and the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. For the 2013 reissue of the album, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Jessica Hopper gave the album a rare 10 out of 10, earning it a &quot;best new reissue&quot; designation.

The 2023 Tony-award-winning play &quot;Stereophonic&quot; is a fictionalized depiction of the recording sessions for the album. In 2024, sound engineer Ken Caillat sued the creators of the play, alleging that they adapted his memoir &quot;Making Rumours: The Inside Story of the Classic Fleetwood Mac Album&quot; without permission. 
==Track listing==


&quot;Silver Springs&quot;, written by Stevie Nicks, has been included on some reissues as either track 6, 7 or 12 of the album, depending on the pressing. Many cassette releases swapped the positions of &quot;Second Hand News&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot;.

<doc id="179295" wikidata="Q519303" url="?curid=179295" title="Team roping">
<text>Team roping also known as heading and heeling is a rodeo event that features a steer (typically a Corriente) and two mounted riders. The first roper is referred to as the &quot;header&quot;, the person who ropes the front of the steer, usually around the horns, but it is also legal for the rope to go around the neck, or go around one horn and the nose resulting in what they call a &quot;half head&quot;. Once the steer is caught by one of the three legal head catches, the header must dally (wrap the rope around the rubber covered saddle horn) and use their horse to turn the steer to the left.

The second roper is the &quot;heeler&quot;, who ropes the steer by its hind feet after the &quot;header&quot; has turned the steer, with a five-second penalty assessed to the end time if only one leg is caught. Team roping is the only rodeo event where men and women compete equally together in professionally sanctioned competition, in both single-gender or mixed-gender teams.

==Origins==
Cowboys originally developed this technique on working ranches when it was necessary to capture and restrain a full-grown animal that was too large to handle by a single man. Over the years, as the sport has grown, a numbering system was added to rate each ropers individual talent level. The numbers go from one to ten (1-10) for headers and one to ten (1-10) for heelers. Using these numbers, a handicap system (the subtraction of time) has been developed to even the competition. Today there are tens of thousands of amateur ropers who compete for millions of dollars in prize money.

==Equipment==

There is specialized equipment used by team ropers:

* Rope - made of synthetic fibers, used to rope the steer, there are two kinds of ropes, one for the header (the person who ropes the head) and one for the heeler (the person who ropes the legs). The header&#x27;s rope is usually 30 to 32 feet in length and is a lot softer (softer means the rope has more elasticity and flexibility). The heeler&#x27;s rope is usually 35 or 36 feet in length and is a lot stiffer (meaning it contains less flexibility and is more rigid to catch the feet).
* Horn wraps - protective wraps that go around the horns of the steer to prevent rope burns and reduce the risk of a horn breaking when roped.
* Roping gloves - worn to prevent rope burns on the hands of the riders.
* Western saddle - Roping saddles have a particularly strong design with double rigging and other specialized features, including a rubber wrap around the saddle horn to keep the dally from slipping, and usually a wooden rawhide-covered saddle tree or a reinforced fiberglass tree.
* Bell boots and brushing boots are placed on the horses&#x27; legs for protection.

==Modern event==
Steers used for roping are moved from a holding corral through a series of narrow alleyways that lead to the roping arena. The alleyways allow the steers to be lined up in single file. Then, one at a time, a steer is moved into a chute with spring-loaded doors in front and a solid gate behind, so that only one animal is released at a time. On each side of the chute is an area called the &quot;box&quot; that is big enough to hold a horse and rider. The &quot;header&quot; is on one side (usually the left, for a right-handed header) whose job is to rope the steer around the horns, then turn the steer so its hind legs can be roped by the &quot;heeler&quot;, who starts from the box on the other side of the chute.

A taut rope, called the &quot;barrier&quot;, runs in front of the header&#x27;s box and is fastened to an easily released rope on the neck of the steer of a designated length, used to ensure that the steer gets a head start. An electronic barrier, consisting of an electric eye connected to a timing device, is sometimes used in place of the barrier rope.

When the header is ready, they call for the steer and an assistant pulls a lever, opening the chute doors. The freed steer breaks out running. When the steer reaches the end of the rope, the barrier releases. The header must rope the steer with one of three legal catches: a clean horn catch around both horns, a neck catch around the neck or a half-head catch around the neck and one horn. The header then takes a &quot;dally&quot;, a couple of wraps of the rope around the horn of the saddle. Some ropers have lost fingers in this event. Once the header has made the dally, the rider turns the horse, usually to the left, and the steer will follow, still running.

The heeler waits until the header has turned the steer. When they have a clear throw, the heeler throws a loop of rope under the running steer&#x27;s hind legs and catches them. As soon as the heeler also dallies tight, the header turns their horse to directly face the steer and heeler. Both horses back up slightly to stretch out the steer&#x27;s hind legs, immobilizing the animal. As soon as the steer is stretched out, an official waves a flag and the time is taken. The steer is released and trots off. There is a 5-second penalty for roping only one hind leg and a 10-second penalty for breaking the barrier if both occur on the same run then the penalties are added together for a total of 15 seconds added.

A successful professional-level team takes between 4 and 8 seconds to stretch the steer, depending on the length of the arena. At lower levels, a team may take longer, particularly if the heeler misses the first throw and has to try again. At higher levels, the header and the heeler are allowed only one throw each, if either misses, the team gets no score.

In some round-robin format competitions the header and heeler are awarded points for each catch instead of timing the run. This puts emphasis on consistency rather than speed. These types of competitions are often more attractive to newer ropers where they can focus on catching rather than having a fast run.

==Rules==
There are various organizations that sanction team roping events at local, regional and national levels. Some of the rules common to most groups include:
* Both riders must start from inside the box
* If the barrier is broken there is a 10-second or 5-second penalty depending on organization 
* If the Heeler catches only one leg there is a 5-second penalty 
* The Heeler cannot throw unless the head of the steer is turned.
* The header has three possible legal catches:
# Both horns
# One horn and the nose (half-head)
# The neck
* Any other head catch is considered illegal.

==Ropes==

A modern rope is usually made of a blend of nylon and poly fibers, though some classic styles are still made of rawhide. Most synthetic ropes are generally quite stiff at the time of purchase, but come in various grades. For beginners, headers start with an extra soft (xs) or an extra, extra soft (xxs) rope. Heelers usually also start with a harder rope. Ropes come in a number of different variations of stiffness. from softest to stiffest there is the extra extra soft (xxs), extra soft (xs), soft (s), medium soft (ms), medium (m), hard medium (hm), and medium hard (mh).

==Technique==

Headers swing their loops overhead in a smooth, flat motion, aim for the back of the steer&#x27;s head and release the loop. When the roper releases, they are to stop the hand open, flat, and palm down at the point where the loop is thrown. Heelers use a different technique, a right-handed heeler will twirl the loop on the left side of the rider&#x27;s body, keeping the tip of the loop to the left. This ensures that when the loop is thrown, it will go under the steer. Heeling is all about timing; the tip of the loop has to be at its lowest point as the steer&#x27;s legs are coming forward. The lay of the loop is also very important; it should stand up against the steer&#x27;s legs with the bottom loop on the ground so the steer will jump right into it.

<text>Wolf children (, ) or Little Germans () were German and Prussian Lithuanian street children that existed in East Prussia at the end of World War II. Wolf children were mostly orphans left behind in the Evacuation of East Prussia and Red Army invasion in early 1945, with many living homeless in the forests of East Prussia or adopted by Lithuanian families.

==Evacuation of East Prussia==
By the end of 1944, as World War II had irreparably turned against Nazi Germany, civilians were forbidden from evacuating the eastern territory of East Prussia even as the inevitable invasion of the Red Army came closer. The &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of East Prussia, Erich Koch, gave orders that fleeing was illegal and punishable (&quot;strenges Fluchtverbot&quot; – flight strictly forbidden), but as the Red Army approached Königsberg many Germans prepared to evacuate anyway. In January 1945, the Evacuation of East Prussia began at the last moment and flight from the territory was allowed.

The Red Army&#x27;s East Prussian Offensive prompted millions of German men, women, and children to flee; however, many adults were killed or wounded during bombing raids or during harsh winters without any food or shelter. Thousands of orphaned children were left behind and fled into the surrounding forest, forced to fend for themselves and facing harsh reprisals if caught by Soviet soldiers. Condemned to live through &quot;begging, , stealing&quot;, older children often tried to keep their siblings together, and survival—searching for food and shelter—became their number-one priority.

===Lithuanian aid===
Many German children went on food-scrounging trips into neighboring Lithuania, where they were adopted by rural Lithuanian farmers who called them &quot;vokietukai&quot; (little Germans) and often gave them food and shelter free of charge. Most of these children made trips back and forth many times to get food for their sick mothers or siblings, travelling along railroad tracks, sometimes catching rides on top of or in between railroad cars, jumping off before reaching Soviet control stations. After the 1990s, the children were branded &quot;wolf children&quot; because of their wolf-like wandering through the forests. Lithuanian farmers who sold their products in the townships of East Prussia in 1946 looked for children and young people to support them in their daily work, and thus many children streamed regularly to the eastern Baltic region to receive food in exchange for products or their labor. They adopted some of the younger ones, and some of the children remained on the Lithuanian farms permanently, but exact statistics are not available. According to rough estimates, 45,000 German children and young people stayed in Lithuania in 1948.

Lithuanians who assisted the German children had to hide their efforts from the Soviet authorities, risking severe punishment if detected, with many German children&#x27;s names changed, and only after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 could they reveal their true identities.

=== Soviet rehoming ===
Soviet authorities sent some children who could be identified as German orphans in the former East Prussia to stay in orphanages administered by Soviet military officers but staffed mostly with some of the remaining Germans. In late 1947, 4,700 German orphans were officially registered in Kaliningrad. Orphans were also adopted by Russian families in the Soviet Union, though documents about these adoptions are not open to the public. In 1948, the children&#x27;s village of Pinnow, then called Kinderdorf Kyritz, was opened. Orphans who managed to live with Lithuanian farmers remained there mostly undetected.

=== Expulsion to Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany===
In 1946, the Soviets began emptying Samland (or Sambia Peninsula) of Germans. In October 1947, the Soviets decided to resettle 30,000 Germans from Kaliningrad Oblast in the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany by train. In 1947, the Soviet Union sent trainloads of orphans to the Occupation Zone; these train rides took four to seven days, partly without food or toilet facilities and some children did not survive. On 15 February 1948, the Ministerial Council of the USSR decided to resettle all Germans in the former East Prussia, declaring them illegal residents in their own homeland. According to Soviet sources, 102,125 people were resettled in 1947 and 1948. Of those, only 99,481 arrived, though sources of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) attributed this to &quot;perhaps a Soviet calculation error.&quot; In May 1951, another 3,000 East Prussian &quot;Umsiedler&quot; Germans came to East Germany. Some orphans managed to flee from East Germany to West Germany where they had better living conditions. At that time, some of the young orphans had no knowledge of their identity, information in search files was vague, and the occupational development difficult.

==Survivors==
None of the events of the Wolf children were reported in the press and they only became known to the public from 1990 after the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The official position of the Soviet and Polish governments at the time was that there were no Germans in these areas, and this had been their official position as early as the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945. Historian Ruth Leiserowitz, who lived in Lithuania, researched and published books about the &quot;Wolfkinder of East Prussia&quot; under her maiden name, Ruth Kibelka, and her married name. Some historical records given by children from East Prussia survived, describing how their families were overtaken by advancing Soviet forces as they tried to flee. They were sent back to their old homes in East Prussia, found them destroyed, were expelled from their homes, and then some died from starvation, cold, and typhoid fever. The orphans had to find a way of surviving and became Wolf children. Another five orphans, born in the years 1930-1939, told Leiserowitz how they managed to survive and were transferred to a children&#x27;s home in East Germany.

In an obituary notice for an East Prussian woman, born in 1939 and deceased in 2009, it was revealed that she had lived as a Wolf child under terrible conditions as an orphan without home and shelter in East Prussia and Lithuania.

The story of one survivor can be read in &quot;ABANDONED AND FORGOTTEN: An Orphan Girl&#x27;s Tale of Survival in World War II by Evelyne Tannehill&quot;, in which Evelyne and her family fell victim to the Soviets who invaded her parents&#x27; farm by the Baltic Sea in East Prussia. Her family was separated; only after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was she able to return to East Prussia to revisit her childhood homeland.

Another outstanding story is that of Liesabeth Otto, born in 1937, who, after her mother had died from starvation, went with her brothers and sisters to her homeplace Wehlau, where she managed to survive until 1953 by working and begging. In 1953, she was sent to a detention camp for children because she was caught stealing food and clothes. After an odyssey through many detention camps, later on looking for work in the Soviet Union, she located her father and brother in West Germany in the 1970s.

Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn described his experiences in Prussia as a Soviet soldier, in his poem &quot;Prussian Nights.&quot;

== Wolf children today in Lithuania ==

=== Fate ===
Several hundred Wolf children were discovered in Lithuania after the separation from Russia. In 2010, almost 100 still lived there. From the beginning of the 1990s on, Wolf children have fought for their German citizenship. They have their own association. The Federal Office of Administration within the German Federal Ministry of the Interior long held that persons who left Königsberg territory after World War II had renounced their German citizenship.

From January 1, 2008, on, compensation is granted by Lithuanian law for those persons who suffered on account of World War II and the Soviet occupation. Consequently, Wolf children get a small additional pension. In German laws, the Wolf children are not mentioned. From private sponsors they get a small quarterly stipend, organized by Wolfgang Freiherr von Stetten.

Today, some Wolf children aim to learn the fate of their relatives, obtain German citizenship, reunite with their families, leave the country for Germany, and remain faithful to German culture.

=== Association ===
The association &quot;Edelweiß-Wolfskinder&quot; is headquartered in Vilnius. Another location is in Klaipėda. It gets support from German donors. The members can meet and exchange views and stories. The members are old and weak and rarely can speak the German language. Aid for the German minority in the Baltic states expired in 2008.

==Search for relatives==
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, people could once again travel to research or reclaim their identities as Germans.

The German Red Cross helps to identify and locate family members who lost contact with one another, such as the Wolf children, during the turmoil in East Prussia. &quot;It was only the politics of Gorbachev which allowed the opening of the Russian archives. Since the 1990s, the fates of about 200,000 additional missing persons have been clarified. More information about the fates of Germans who were taken prisoners and died still remain in unopened archives in Eastern and South-eastern Europe.

== In memory ==
Valdas Adamkus, then President of Lithuania, stated that an exhibition will be opened in Bad Iburg which will be named &quot;The Lost History of East Prussia: Wolf Children and Their Fate&quot;.

Five kilometers north of Tilsit on the crossroad of A 216 Tauroggen-Tilsit with A 226 from Heydekrug there is a memorial for Wolf children (&quot;Wolfskinder-Denkmal&quot;). The goal of the memorial is to publicize the fate of all human beings who were killed or died from starvation in East Prussia in the years 1944-1947, and to remember the orphan children left behind. Another memorial, the House of Wolf children, will be created with a permanent exhibition to remember Wolf children in Mikytai/Mikieten at the crossroad Sovetsk/Tilsit. This memorial will be organized by historians of the Verein Wolfkinder.Geschichtsverein e. V. in Berlin.

Former German President Christian Wulff was visited on May 10, 2011, by a group of Wolf children from Lithuania. The leader of the parliamentary group within CDU/CSU for expelled, relocated and German minorities, Klaus Brähmig, believes that research on Wolf children should be intensified:

<doc id="179299" wikidata="Q1427756" url="?curid=179299" title="Fleetwood Mac (1975 album)">
<text>Fleetwood Mac is the tenth studio album by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, released on 11 July 1975 in the United States and on 1 August 1975 in the United Kingdom by Reprise Records. It is the band&#x27;s second eponymous album, the first being their 1968 debut album, and is sometimes referred to by fans as the White Album. It is the first Fleetwood Mac album with Lindsey Buckingham as guitarist and Stevie Nicks as a vocalist, after Bob Welch departed the band in late 1974. It is also the band&#x27;s last album to be released on the Reprise label until 1997&#x27;s &quot;The Dance&quot;; the band&#x27;s subsequent albums until then were released through Warner Bros. Records, Reprise&#x27;s parent company.

The album peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart on 4 September 1976, 58 weeks after entering the chart, and spawned three top-twenty singles: &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, the last two falling just short of the top ten, both at number 11. It has been certified 7× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over seven million copies in the United States. Peaking at number 23 on the UK Albums Chart, it was the start of a run of hugely successful albums for the band in Britain, with six number ones, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; being followed by &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977), &quot;Tusk&quot; (1979), &quot;Mirage&quot; (1982), &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; (1987), and &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (1990).

==Background==
In 1974, Fleetwood Mac relocated from England to California to manage the band&#x27;s affairs better. In California, they recorded an album, &quot;Heroes Are Hard to Find&quot;, and set out on tour. Shortly after finishing the tour, Bob Welch (guitarist, singer, and composer) left the band, ending Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s ninth lineup in eight years, to form the band Paris.

Prior to Welch&#x27;s departure, Mick Fleetwood met with producer Keith Olsen at Sound City Studios to listen to some demos. There, Olsen played Fleetwood an album he had recently engineered, titled &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot;. Fleetwood particularly enjoyed the guitar solo on the song &quot;Frozen Love&quot;, and decided to hire both Olsen and the guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham. However, Buckingham would not accept Fleetwood&#x27;s offer unless he agreed to also hire Buckingham&#x27;s musical and romantic partner, Stevie Nicks, even though they were close to breaking up. After an informal interview at a Mexican restaurant, Mick Fleetwood invited both Buckingham and Nicks to join the band, and this tenth lineup of the band proved to be its most successful. Within three months, the band had recorded the album &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;.

During the recording sessions, bassist John McVie clashed with Buckingham over creative decisions made in the studio, particularly over some of the album&#x27;s bass parts. McVie reminded Buckingham that &quot;The band you&#x27;re in is Fleetwood Mac. I&#x27;m the Mac. And I play the bass.&quot; Buckingham told &quot;Billboard&quot; that Christine McVie was more receptive to his creative input. &quot;It was so clear that right away that Christine and I had this thing. She was just really looking for direction. She was open to me taking liberties with her songs. So early on, that was probably the first thing that hit me about being in Fleetwood Mac was being extremely aware that I had something to contribute to Christine’s songs as a producer and possibly as a co-writer.&quot;

Many of the songs on &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; were written before Buckingham and Nicks joined the band. &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m So Afraid&quot;, and &quot;Monday Morning&quot; were written and performed live by the duo and were initially slated to appear on a second Buckingham Nicks album. &quot;Crystal&quot; was recycled from the first Buckingham Nicks album, but with a different arrangement. Fleetwood praised these songs as &quot;show stoppers, even as rough sketches recorded on Lindsey&#x27;s four-track.

Like all of the band&#x27;s studio albums, the front cover photo of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; does not show the whole band, including, in this case, only drummer Mick Fleetwood (standing) and bass guitarist John McVie (kneeling).

==Release and reception==
&quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; was released on 11 July 1975. Though the band experienced only modest success immediately after the release, they were determined to promote their new album, and after touring for several months, they started to see the results of their hard work. In an interview with &quot;Uncut&quot;, Stevie Nicks said of the album: &quot;We just played everywhere and we sold that record. We kicked that album in the ass.&quot; 15 months after its release, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; reached the top of the US charts.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 182 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the ranking in a 2012 revised list.

===Singles===
All of the singles that derived from &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; used mixes of the songs different from those used on the album (and occasionally different takes, as in the case of &quot;Over My Head&quot;). A &quot;single mix&quot; was also created for &quot;Blue Letter&quot;, and this mix was only available as the B-side of the &quot;Warm Ways&quot; single from 1975 until it was included as a bonus track on the 2004 re-issue of the album (along with an instrumental called &quot;Jam #2&quot; and the single versions of &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)&quot;, and &quot;Over My Head&quot;).

In the US, the album spawned three top twenty singles: &quot;Over My Head&quot;, &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, and &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;, the last two falling just short of the top ten, both at number 11. A version of &quot;Landslide&quot; taken from the live reunion album &quot;The Dance&quot; was released as a single in the US in 1998 and reached number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In the UK, the album&#x27;s first single was &quot;Warm Ways&quot;, which was not released as a single in the US. Initially, the album generated limited interest in the UK, and the first three singles released by the new lineup failed to enter the UK Singles Chart, while &quot;Say You Love Me&quot; reached number 40. Following the massive success of &quot;Rumours&quot; two years later, however, interest in the band reignited, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; was re-released in 1978, and a reissue of &quot;Rhiannon&quot; peaked at number 46.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number 183 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart dated 2 August 1975. It eventually reached its peak at number one on the chart dated 4 September 1976, which was 57 weeks after it had entered the chart. On 11 September 2018, the album was certified seven times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over seven million copies in the United States.

In the UK, the album initially did not enter the charts and made its debut at number 49 on the UK Albums Chart dated 6 November 1976, well over a year after the album&#x27;s release. It peaked at number 23 its second week on the chart. On 5 July 1978, the album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 100,000 copies in the UK.

<text>The Leaving Certificate Examination (), commonly referred to as the Leaving Cert or (informally) the Leaving (), is the final exam of the Irish secondary school system and the university matriculation examination in Ireland. It takes a minimum of two years&#x27; preparation, but an optional Transition Year means that for those students it takes place three years after the Junior Cycle examination. These years are referred to collectively as &quot;The Senior Cycle&quot;. Most students taking the examination are aged 16–19; in excess of eighty percent of this group undertake the exam. The Examination is overseen by the State Examinations Commission. The Leaving Certificate Examinations are taken annually by approximately 60,000 students.

In 2018, the Department of Education alongside the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment confirmed that the senior cycle is under review with Politics and Society, Physical Education, and Computer Science the first of the new subjects to be part of the reforms. Core subjects such as Irish, English, Mathematics, and European languages will be changed in due course.

==Programmes==

There are three distinct programmes that can be followed. While the outcomes of each programme are quite distinct, each is intended to reinforce the principles of secondary education – to prepare the student for education, society and work.

===Established Leaving Certificate===
The Established Leaving Certificate, introduced in 1924, is the most common programme taken. A minimum of six subjects are examined, including compulsory Irish. Exemption from the mandatory study of the Irish language is described in &quot;Circular M10/94 (Department of Education, Ireland, 1994)&quot; and the exemption can be acquired because of time spent living abroad or a learning disability such as dyslexia. Most students take seven subjects.

===Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme===
The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, introduced as a more practical &quot;hands-on&quot; complement to the conventional Leaving Certificate, is similar to the established programme.

===Leaving Certificate Applied===

The Leaving Certificate Applied, another variant of the traditional Leaving Certificate, is taken to prepare the student for adult and working life.

==Grading==
===Leaving Certificate===

Each subject is examined at one of three levels, &quot;Higher Level&quot; (informally called &quot;Honours&quot;), &quot;Ordinary Level&quot; (informally &quot;Pass&quot;), or &quot;Foundation Level&quot;. Foundation Level may only be taken in two subjects: Irish and Mathematics. All other subjects may be taken at either Ordinary or Higher Level. At each level, a percentage is assigned and translated to eight possible grades. These are usually written H1-H8, O1-O8 and F1-F8.

There have been proposals to impose a normal distribution on Leaving Certificate Examination scores, however, this ignores quantification problems and issues such as an A in one subject like Mathematics reflects greater attainment than an A in another subject.

Admission to universities and colleges is by a points system, run by the Central Applications Office (CAO). The points allocations shown in the accompanying table have been collectively agreed by the third-level institutions involved in the CAO scheme, and relativities that they imply have no official standing in the eyes of the State Examinations Commission or the Department of Education. The points awarded for a given percentage range are given in the table. Note that points for foundation level are only awarded for Mathematics, and only then by some institutions. A bonus for higher level Mathematics is part of the currently agreed system.

Mathematics bonus points
Since 2012, a pass (minimum H6, originally D3) in higher level Mathematics is awarded 25 bonus points, making it possible to earn 125 points in this subject. Twenty-five bonus points are awarded for higher level Mathematics for H6 grades and above. For example, if an applicant receives an H6 grade, an additional 25 points will be added to the 46 points already awarded, i.e. higher level Mathematics now carries a score of 71 points. This also means that, provided they pass, the minimum number of points a student can receive is 71, which is 15 points greater than an O1 at Ordinary Level.

===Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme===
The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme allows students to take &quot;link modules&quot;, which have their own grading scheme and associated CAO points.

===Predicted grades===
In 2020, the Leaving Certificate was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the first official cancellation in its existence. Leaving Certificate students were then given the choice of having teachers predict their own students&#x27; grades, which would then be nationally standardised. If students were not happy with their predicted grades, however, they could appeal their results and choose to sit a traditional exam in November 2020. The results would not be available in time for the 2020 academic year. In 2021, for each subject, candidates were given a choice to sit the Leaving Certificate examinations, take an Accredited Grade or opt for the better of the two. The examinations were extended over a 15-day period, instead of the usual 13 day period. The Accredited Grades are based on school-estimated marks and a standardisation process.

==Subjects available==
The subjects listed below are available to Leaving Certificate students, though most schools only offer a limited number. The subjects are in five groups, with most subjects belonging to one group.

===Language group===
L1, Mandatory languages
*English &quot;(mandatory with exceptions)&quot;

L2, Native, Modern and Classical languages

Taking a third, foreign language is mandatory in some secondary schools due to most courses in the National University of Ireland (NUI) universities (University of Galway, University College Cork, Maynooth University) requiring a foreign language as an entry requirement, usually excluding engineering and computer science related courses.

Non-curricular languages

The following languages can only be taken if the student is from a member state of the European Union, speaks the language in which they opt to be examined in as a mother tongue, has followed a programme of study leading to the Leaving Certificate and is taking Leaving Certificate English. Another condition is that candidate may undertake examination in one non-curricular language subject only.

Physical Education (P.E.) was made an official Leaving Certificate subject as of 11 November 2017. Students can now receive grades for sport, dance and other activities. It was first implemented in September 2018 for incoming Fifth Year students and was first examined in 2020.

Computer Science was introduced from September 2018 at 40 secondary schools. From September 2020 it was available to all schools in Ireland.

===Social studies group===
*Art 
*Geography
*History
*Home Economics - Scientific and Social (also in Applied Science group)

====Section footnotes====
†Subject exclusions – candidates may not take any of the following subject combinations:
*Classical Studies and Ancient Greek
*Classical Studies and Latin
*Physics and Chemistry (combined) and either Physics (alone) or Chemistry (alone)

The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP) is an additional Link Module which may be taken along with the other optional subjects. Students wishing to sit the LCVP Link Modules Exam had to meet specific requirements (This was dropped in September 2022). 
Pre-September 2022: Students had to take an extra language subject and must have had one or more of the following subject combinations:

;Specialist groupings
# Construction Studies or Engineering or Technical Drawing (any two)
# Physics and Construction Studies or Engineering
# Agricultural Science and Construction Studies or Engineering
# Agricultural Science and Chemistry or Physics or Physics and Chemistry (combined subject)
# Home Economics and Agricultural Science or Biology
# Home Economics and Art
# Accounting or Business or Economics (any two)
# Physics and Chemistry
# Biology and Agricultural Science
# Biology and Chemistry or Physics or Physics and Chemistry (combined)
;Services groupings
==Exam format==

Subjects are examined through a number of methods. These include at least one written paper (English, Mathematics, Irish and some of the optional courses contain two written papers).

Language courses examine the student&#x27;s writing, conversation and listening skills. The spoken section of the exams (&#x27;oral&#x27;) takes place some months before the written exams, and the listening (&#x27;aurals&#x27;) takes place in the same weeks as the written.

A number of subjects in the sciences and arts include the keeping of records or creation of a physical object or project. This work is designed to provide tangible proof of the students&#x27; abilities. However, not every book or project is examined, with inspectors being sent to a small few, randomly selected schools each year, or simply examining a small selection of projects from each class to check the standard. Some subjects such as Art and Technology involve a practical exam which is supervised by an external examiner. In the academic year of the written exam, all practical science subjects are partially examined by student assignments which involve less focus on traditional exam formats and getting students to put the theory they have learned into practice, typically through a project which involves the creation of unique artifacts.

===Variants===
Each subject&#x27;s paper at Leaving Certificate level may have as few as two variants, or as many as six. They are divided by level: Higher and Ordinary, and in the case of Irish and Mathematics, Foundation. Each subject level-variant will also have provisions for both English and Irish speakers, with the exception of English and Irish themselves (which are printed exclusively in the relevant language). Certain subjects are printed in a combined English/Irish format, such as French or German. This leaves such subjects with only two versions: a bilingual Higher, and a bilingual Ordinary. However, Mathematics, in contrast, has a total of six: three levels: Higher, Ordinary and Foundation, each with both English and Irish versions.

Higher Level papers are printed on pink paper, while Ordinary Level papers are printed on powder blue paper. In the case of certain subjects, such as Geography, full-colour photographs need to be printed and as such, all pages but the cover are white.

==Exam paper leaks==

===1957===
In 1957, papers in Latin, English and Mathematics became available to some students before the exams. Supplemental examinations were held later in June.

===1969===
On 12 June 1969, exam papers were stolen in a break-in to a Dublin secondary school. Examination papers, including English, Mathematics and Physics were circulated among students. The repeat examinations for English and Mathematics paper 2 were rescheduled for 27 June 1969 and 28 June 1969 respectively.

===2009===
On the first day of examinations on 3 June 2009, the second paper of the Leaving Certificate English examination (initially scheduled for 4 June) was accidentally distributed instead of Paper 1 at an examination centre in St. Oliver&#x27;s Community College in Drogheda. It was confirmed that a number of candidates had seen the paper before the mistake was acted upon. The invigilator had failed to report the incident straight away and was immediately suspended. A State Examinations Commission (SEC) official had visited the examination centre on the day in question as part of a routine inspection, and no report was made by the invigilator to the official. Owing to the time at which the SEC was informed, it was unable to distribute the contingency paper in time for the following morning. Details of the leaked paper had already circulated onto many online message boards and social networking sites, many hours after the incident had taken place. The exam was rescheduled for Saturday 6 June, from 09:30 to 12:50. About 10 Jewish students, who could not sit the exam at the rescheduled time because it conflicted with Shabbat, were sent to an Orthodox household in Dublin, where they were sequestered from all electronic media (as is normal for Shabbat) and kept under supervision until they sat the exam on Sunday morning.

==Matriculation to university using the Leaving Certificate==
===Qualification for domestic universities===
Matriculation is administered by the Central Applications Office (CAO) following requirements laid down by the universities. Applicants must present English and Mathematics, while certain universities also require Irish and/or a foreign language. Some courses require specific subjects to be taken at secondary level. For example, veterinary medicine applicants must present with a minimum grade of H5 in Chemistry at higher level. Most commonly, engineering and science programmes require Mathematics and/or a physical science. Other courses, such as Medicine, have similar matriculation requirements. From 2012 onwards, the greatest CAO points that can be achieved in the Leaving Certificate is 625 points, equivalent to six Higher Level H1s and 25 bonus points for passing (scoring an H6 or higher) Higher-Level Mathematics. Every year, approximately 150 students score the maximum grade with 10–20 students receiving seven H1s or more.

Generally, students are required to have pass grades in English, Mathematics, Irish and/or a foreign language to gain entry to university. The concept of failing the Leaving Certificate is not applied.
When demand exceeds supply for a university course (the norm), the CAO will award a candidate&#x27;s points based on their Leaving Certificate performance in six subjects. The majority of candidates take six to eight subjects, including English, Mathematics and Irish (exemptions available) and usually a foreign language, with the points from their six highest-scoring subjects being considered. Once base criteria have been met, course places are offered to the applicants with the highest points.

Subjects taken at foundation level are rarely counted for matriculation to university.

Some universities require a foreign language and Irish. Exemptions are available for learning difficulties, birth outside Ireland, not having taken Irish before the age of eleven years, and studying abroad for a period of at least two years after the age of eleven.

====After 2017====
The Department of Education introduced a new Leaving Certificate grading scale in 2017. The new scale has eight grades, the highest being a Grade 1, the lowest being a Grade 8. The highest seven grades 1-7 divide the marks range 100% to 30% into seven equal grade bands 10% wide, with a grade 8 being awarded for percentage marks of less than 30%. The grades at Higher Level and Ordinary Level are distinguished by prefixing the grade with H or O respectively, giving H1-H8 at higher level, and O1-O8 at ordinary level. This new 8-point grading scale replaces the former 14-point scale at both Higher and Ordinary levels. Previously, the majority of students receiving a given grade were within three percentage marks of a higher grade, and five extra points, creating pressure towards rote learning and using the marking scheme to gain those few additional marks. The new broader grade bands eases the pressure on students to achieve marginal gains in examinations and encourage more substantial engagement with each subject. The new grading system also allows for greater flexibility, variety,
and innovation in Leaving Certificate assessments. The broader objective is to allow for an enhanced learner experience in senior cycle, with a greater focus on the achievement of broader
learning objectives. The new eight-point scale moves the Leaving
Certificate closer to school leaving examinations in other countries, such as Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, Finland, and to the International Baccalaureate.

====Historical CAO points system====

From 1992 to 2016, subdivided A, B, C, D, E, F and NG grades were awarded at the Leaving Certificate. A common points system was used by the CAO using six subjects. From 2012, 25 bonus points were given for higher-level Mathematics at D grades and above. Before, the University of Limerick awarded up to 40 bonus points for Mathematics (Higher Level) in an increasing scale of points starting at five bonus points for a C3 continuing up to 40 for an A1 grade. This was an attempt to correct the decline in demand for scientific subjects. In 2009, 16.2% of students attempted the higher level Mathematics paper.

Before 1992, the Leaving Certificate awarded A, B, C, D, E, F and NG grades without subdivisions, providing broader grade bands similar to those introduced in 2017. While there was a common application system from the 1970s, the method of calculating points varied from institution to institution and even type of qualification, up to 1991. The number of subjects considered for points and Mathematics bonuses were not consistent. For example, in some cases bonus points for Mathematics only applied for particular courses (e.g. Dublin Institute of Technology applied bonus points for engineering only).

===University outside of Ireland===

Some Irish students go to university in the United Kingdom, particularly in Northern Ireland and larger British cities.

In recognition of this, the Established Leaving Certificate underwent a process with the British Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) to gain entry to the UCAS Tariff for direct entry to United Kingdom universities. This introduced the examination directly onto the Tariff, allowing it to be compared more easily with other qualifications on the Tariff. After comparing syllabi of the Irish Leaving Certificate and British GCE A-Levels, it was decided that a Leaving Certificate (higher) subject will be worth two-thirds of an A-level (UK, except Scotland). This is because Leaving Certificate students undertake several more subjects (often a total of six to eight) than a typical A level student, but as a result study them in a more narrow fashion.

Increasingly, Irish students are making use of universities situated within the European Union such as the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, France, Spain, Italy and Poland. Many universities in central and eastern Europe provide courses in English to attract students from Ireland and other countries. A small number of students apply to attend universities outside of Europe, including the United States, Canada, and Australia.

==Dates==

The exams usually begin on the first Wednesday in June, traditionally commencing with English Paper One, followed by Paper Two on Thursday afternoon. The exams typically last two and a half weeks, but may last longer for students taking exams in uncommon subjects, such as non-curricular languages. Exams were cancelled or postponed in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The exam timetable was reorganised in 2008 to reduce the intensity of the exam period. Particular changes included the moving of English Paper Two to Thursday afternoon, as opposed to its usual time of Wednesday afternoon after English Paper One, to reduce the amount of writing candidates were required to do at the beginning of the exams.

A superstition currently exists in Ireland that the weather across the country noticeably improves the moment the exams begin.

== Response to the COVID-19 pandemic ==
=== 2020 ===
Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, then Minister for Education and Skills, Joe McHugh, announced on 10 April 2020 that the exams would be postponed and begin on 29 July to early August. This announcement faced backlash as a poll found 71% of parents were against the solution and wanted an alternative. A campaign was set up with the aim of replacing the Leaving Cert with predicted grades, with a petition on &quot;CancelTheLC.com&quot; receiving 20,000 signatures. Political pressure also occurred as the Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin parties were critical of the solution and urged the Leaving Certificate exams to be cancelled.

On 8 May 2020, it was announced that the exams would not go ahead in the summer based on medical evidence stating that it would not be safe to do so. All students were to be offered the option to accept calculated grades instead of sitting postponed exams that would go on at a later date when it would be safe to run exams. This faced controversy: in particular, a step involving &quot;school profiling&quot; became a topic of debate in government. Concerns about parental efforts to influence grades given by teachers, or fears that they would sue teachers for giving bad grades, were also raised. Teachers were also expected to announce any conflict of interest they may have in grading their students.

On 21 May 2020, the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland instructed its members to not follow the new calculated guidelines unless they were given greater legal protection, but this issue was resolved the following day.
 Students were asked to register for calculated grades, and over 98% of them did so.

For students who wanted to take the examinations, the Leaving Certificate was run from 16 November–11 December 2020 in the evenings and at weekends.

=== 2021 ===
In 2021, the Leaving Certificate was also changed. The calculated grades methodology was revised and now known as Accredited Grades.

The Education (Leaving Certificate 2021) (Accredited Grades) Act 2021 was brought to Dáil Éireann by Minister for Education Norma Foley and signed by the President on 25 May 2021. It created the grounds for the State Examinations Commission to conduct the Accredited Grades process (as opposed to the Department of Education and Skills in 2020) and laid out provisions to protect the integrity of the Accredited Grades process. Interference such as contacting teachers, principals, or tutors in any manner that could influence their judgement could be punished by the State Examinations Commission withholding any or all of the Accredited Grades of a student.

New consultants, Educational Testing Services, a US-based non-profit organisation were contracted to build the process. The model was similar to the calculated grades model of 2020 but with code improvements.

Students were offered the choice of Accredited Grades, the option to sit the Leaving Cert in June of that year, or both options. Unlike in 2020, students were also given the choice to select which of the three options they desired for each subject they would take in the Leaving Certificate. Ireland is believed to be the only country that had such a system in 2021. In the case where a grade for a subject was produced from both the written examination or an Accredited Grade, the system would award a student the higher of the two grades, regardless of any other factors. Students made their decisions on which subjects for the Leaving Cert they wished to present for, and which manner of grades they wanted on the Candidate Self-Service Portal &quot;(CSSP)&quot; website. It was later revealed that the SEC would generate Accredited Grades for all students where possible, even if they chose not to participate in the Accredited Grades process.

Participation of the written examinations were lower than in years previous to 2020. 5,087 students opted to not do any written examinations. However, there were no penalties to opting into doing the written examination in a subject (along with the Accredited Grade), and not showing up to the examination. Only 60% of written papers that were opted into were actually done by students. This led to an excess of exam scripts after the examinations.

Grade inflation became a problem. The Central Applications Office (CAO) expressed concern about the continued value of Leaving Certificates.
== International usage ==
Only one school outside Ireland offers the Leaving Certificate exam to their students. Since 1997, students at the ISM international school in Tripoli, Libya take the Leaving Cert with Arabic being substituted for Irish and Libyan history for Irish history.

<doc id="179303" wikidata="Q715915" url="?curid=179303" title="Little Brother Montgomery">
<text>Eurreal Wilford &quot;Little Brother&quot; Montgomery (April 18, 1906 – September 6, 1985) was an American jazz, boogie-woogie and blues pianist and singer.

Largely self-taught, Montgomery was an important blues pianist with an original style. He was also versatile, working in jazz bands, including larger ensembles that used written arrangements. He did not read music but learned band routines by ear.

==Career==
Montgomery was born in Kentwood, Louisiana, United States, a sawmill town near the Mississippi border, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, where he spent much of his childhood. Both his parents were of African-American and Creek Indian ancestry. As a child he looked like his father, Harper Montgomery, and was called Little Brother Harper. The name evolved into Little Brother Montgomery, and the nickname stuck. He started playing piano at the age of four, and by age 11 he left home for four years and played at barrelhouses in Louisiana. His main musical influence was Jelly Roll Morton, who used to visit the Montgomery household.

Early in his career he performed at African-American lumber and turpentine camps in Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. He then played with the bands of Clarence Desdunes and Buddy Petit. He lived in Chicago from 1928 to 1931, regularly playing at rent parties, and Chicago was where he made his first recordings. From 1931 through 1938, he led a jazz ensemble, the Southland Troubadours, in Jackson, Mississippi.

In 1941, Montgomery moved back to Chicago, which would be his home for the rest of his life, and went on tours to other cities in the United States and Europe. He toured briefly with Otis Rush in 1956. In the late 1950s he was discovered by a wider white audience. His fame grew in the 1960s, and he continued to make many recordings, some of them on his own record label, FM Records, which he formed in 1969 (FM stood for Floberg Montgomery, Floberg being the maiden name of his wife).

Montgomery toured Europe several times in the 1960s and recorded some of his albums there. He appeared at many blues and folk festivals during the following decade and was considered a living legend, a link to the early days of blues in New Orleans.

Among his original compositions are &quot;Shreveport Farewell&quot;, &quot;Farrish Street Jive&quot;, and &quot;Vicksburg Blues&quot;. His instrumental &quot;Crescent City Blues&quot; served as the basis for a song of the same name by Gordon Jenkins, which in turn was adapted by Johnny Cash as &quot;Folsom Prison Blues.&quot;

In 1968, Montgomery contributed to two albums by Spanky and Our Gang, &quot;Like to Get to Know You&quot; and &quot;Anything You Choose b/w Without Rhyme or Reason&quot;.

Montgomery died on September 6, 1985, in Champaign, Illinois, and was interred in the Oak Woods Cemetery.

In 2013, Montgomery was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame.

The R&amp;B musician and producer Paul Gayten was Montgomery&#x27;s nephew.

<doc id="179304" wikidata="Q233999" url="?curid=179304" title="Nadezhda Alliluyeva">
<text>Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva (; – 9 November 1932) was the second wife of Joseph Stalin. She was born in Baku to a friend of Stalin, a fellow revolutionary, and was raised in Saint Petersburg. Having known Stalin from a young age, she married him when she was 17, and they had two children. Alliluyeva worked as a secretary for Bolshevik leaders, including Vladimir Lenin and Stalin, before enrolling at the Industrial Academy in Moscow to study synthetic fibres and become an engineer. She had health issues, which had an adverse impact on her relationship with Stalin. She also suspected he was unfaithful, which led to frequent arguments with him. On several occasions, Alliluyeva reportedly contemplated leaving Stalin, and after an argument, she fatally shot herself early in the morning of 9 November 1932.

==Early life==
===Background===
Alliluyeva&#x27;s father, Sergei Alliluyev (1866–1945), was from a peasant family in Voronezh Oblast (modern southwest Russia). He moved to the Caucasus, where he worked as an electrician for the rail depot and first became familiar with working conditions in the Russian Empire. Sergei&#x27;s grandmother was Romani, a fact to which his granddaughter, Svetlana, attributed the &quot;southern, somewhat exotic features&quot; and &quot;black eyes&quot; that characterized the Alliluyevs. Sergei joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1898, and became an active member in workers&#x27; study circles; it was through these meetings he met Mikhail Kalinin, one of the chief organizers of the party in the Caucasus. Sergei had been arrested and exiled to Siberia, but by 1902 he had returned to the Caucasus. In 1904, he met Ioseb Jughashvili (later known as Joseph Stalin) while helping to move a printing machine from Baku to Tiflis. Her godfather was Avel Yenukidze who was a Georgian &quot;Old Bolshevik&quot; and associate of Stalin.

Alliluyeva&#x27;s mother, Olga Fedotenko (1877–1951), was the youngest of nine children of Evgeni Fedotenko and Magdalena Eicholz. Alliluyeva&#x27;s daughter Svetlana wrote in her memoir that Evgeni had Ukrainian ancestry on his father&#x27;s side, his mother was Georgian, and he grew up speaking Georgian at home. Magdalena came from a family of German settlers, and spoke German and Georgian at home. Olga&#x27;s father initially wanted her to marry one of his friend&#x27;s sons, but she refused to accept the arrangements and left home at 14 to live with Sergei, joining him in Tiflis.

===Youth===
Nadezhda Alliluyeva, born in Baku on 22 September 1901, was the youngest of four children, following Anna, Fyodor, and Pavel. The family moved to Moscow in 1904, but had returned to Baku by 1906. In 1907, to avoid arrest, Sergei moved the family to Saint Petersburg, where they would remain. The family would often help hide members of the Bolsheviks, a Russian revolutionary group, at their home, including Stalin. Sergei Aliluyev worked at an electricity station, and by 1911 was named head of a sector there, allowing the family to afford a comfortable lifestyle.

Exposed to revolutionary activity throughout her youth, Alliluyeva first became a supporter of the Bolsheviks while in school. Her family frequently hosted party members at their home, including hiding Vladimir Lenin during the July Days of 1917, which further strengthened Alliluyeva&#x27;s views. After Lenin escaped Russia in August 1917, Stalin arrived. He had known Alliluyeva since she was a child, reportedly having saved her from drowning when they were both in Baku. It had been many years since they had last seen each other, and over the rest of the summer they became close. The couple married in February or March 1919. Stalin was a 40-year-old widower and father of one son (Yakov), born in 1907 to Stalin&#x27;s first wife, Kato Svanidze, who died of typhus later that year. There was no ceremony for the marriage, as Bolsheviks frowned upon religious customs.

==Later life and career==
===Professional life===
The Bolsheviks took power in Russia in November 1917 (O.S. October 1917), which led to the Russian Civil War. In 1918, Alliluyeva and Stalin moved to Moscow, joining other Bolshevik leaders as the capital was transferred there from Petrograd. They took up residence in the Amusement Palace of the Kremlin, occupying separate rooms. Stalin made Alliluyeva a secretary at the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Nationalities, where he served as the head, and in May brought her and her brother Fyodor with him to Tsaritsyn, where the Bolsheviks were fighting the White Army as part of the Russian Civil War. Alliluyeva did not stay long there and returned to Moscow, though Stalin&#x27;s involvement in the Civil War meant he was rarely at home. By 1921 the Civil War had ended, and in 1922 the Soviet Union was established, Lenin taking the leading role.

Not wanting to be dependent on Stalin, Alliluyeva transferred positions and joined Lenin&#x27;s secretariat. This allegedly annoyed Stalin, who wanted his wife to quit her job and remain at home. Alliluyeva was comfortable working for Lenin and his wife Nadezhda Krupskaya, also a Bolshevik functionary, as they were more lenient about her work than Stalin: for example, Lenin knew that Alliluyeva had left school at a young age and consequently forgave her for spelling errors.

In 1921, a few months after the birth of their first child, Vasily, Alliluyeva was expelled from the Bolshevik Party; according to historian Oleg Khlevniuk she had trouble managing family life, professional work, and party work, and was considered &quot;ballast with no interest in the life of the party whatsoever&quot;. Although she was admitted back through the intercession of top party officials, including Lenin, her full status was not restored until 1924. Alliluyeva was concerned that if she did not work outside the home, she would not be taken seriously. She also desired to be qualified for any role she took up. After working in Lenin&#x27;s office, Alliluyeva transferred to briefly work for Sergo Ordzhonikidze, a close friend of Stalin&#x27;s and a fellow senior Bolshevik, and then on to the International Agrarian Institute in the Department of Agitation and Propaganda as an assistant.

Lenin died in 1924 and was ultimately succeeded as leader of the Soviet Union by Stalin. Tired of her work and not happy in her role as the &quot;First Lady&quot;, Alliluyeva looked for something else to do with herself. Interested in education and wanting to be more involved with the party, in 1929 she enrolled in the Industrial Academy to study engineering and synthetic fibres, which was a new technology at the time, and became more active in local party meetings. As was the custom of the time, Alliluyeva registered using her maiden name, which also allowed her to keep a low profile; it is unclear if her associates knew who she was, though it is likely that at least the local party boss, Nikita Khrushchev, knew of her. Alliluyeva frequently took the tram from the Kremlin to the academy, joined by , the wife of Andrey Andreyev, a leading Bolshevik and associate of Stalin. At the academy, Alliluyeva interacted with students from across the Soviet Union. Some have speculated that Alliluyeva learned of the issues the population was facing as a result of the collectivization of agriculture, including the famine in Ukraine, and argued with Stalin about this. Khlevniuk concludes that &quot;there is absolutely no hard evidence that [Alliluyeva] objected to her husband&#x27;s policies... Her letters give the impression that she, like the rest of the Bolshevik elite, was completely isolated from the suffering of tens of millions outside the Kremlin walls.&quot;

===Family life===
Alliluyeva had her first child, Vasily, in 1921. Historian Simon Sebag Montefiore noted that she walked to the hospital to give birth in a show of &quot;Bolshevik austerity&quot;. A second child, daughter Svetlana, was born in 1926. In 1921, the family also took in Stalin&#x27;s first son, Yakov Dzhugashvili, who had been living in Tiflis with Svandize&#x27;s relatives. Alliluyeva was only six years older than her step-son, Dzhugashvili, with whom she developed a friendly relationship. Around the same time the family also took in Artyom Sergeyev, the son of Fyodor Sergeyev, a close friend of Stalin. Fyodor died four months after the birth of Artyom in an accident, and though his mother was still alive, the boy was raised in the Stalin household.

Interested in pursuing a professional career, Alliluyeva did not spend much time with her children, and instead hired a nanny, Alexandra Bychokova, to watch the children. When Alliluyeva dealt with her children, though, she was quite strict: Svetlana would later recall that the only letter she received from her mother scolded her for &quot;being terribly naughty&quot;, despite Svetlana&#x27;s being only four or five at the time. She would also recall that the only person Stalin feared was Alliluyeva. Even so, Alliluyeva wanted to ensure the children received a good education.

During the week, the family would stay in their Kremlin apartment, where Alliluyeva maintained a simple lifestyle and controlled the family&#x27;s expenses. On weekends, they would often go to their dacha on the outskirts of Moscow. Alliluyeva&#x27;s siblings and their families lived nearby, and they would all frequently get together on these occasions. In the summer, Stalin would holiday along the coast of the Black Sea, near Sochi or in Abkhazia, and was frequently joined by Alliluyeva, though by 1929 she would spend only a few days there before returning to Moscow for her studies. Though apart, the two of them would frequently write letters to each other.

According to her close friend, Polina Zhemchuzhina, the marriage was strained, and the two argued frequently. Stalin believed that Alliluyeva&#x27;s mother was schizophrenic. Karl Pauker, then head of Stalin&#x27;s personal security, was an unwilling witness of their quarrels. &quot;She is like a flint,&quot; Pauker said of Alliluyeva, &quot;[Stalin] is very rough with her, but even he is afraid of her sometimes. Especially when the smile disappears from her face.&quot; She suspected Stalin was unfaithful with other women, though according to Boris Bazhanov, Stalin&#x27;s one-time secretary, &quot;women didn&#x27;t interest [Stalin]. His own woman was enough for him, and he paid scant attention to her.&quot;

Along with her husband&#x27;s alleged neglect, Alliluyeva&#x27;s last years were darkened by ill health. She was suffering from &quot;terrible depressions&quot;, headaches, and early menopause; her daughter later claimed that Alliluyeva had &quot;feminine problems&quot; because of a &quot;couple of abortions which were never attended to&quot;. On several occasions, Alliluyeva reportedly considered leaving Stalin and taking the children with her, and in 1926 she left for a short time, moving to Leningrad. Stalin called her back, and she returned to stay with him. Her nephew Alexander Alliluyev would later claim that shortly before her death Alliluyeva was again planning to leave Stalin, but there is no evidence to confirm this assertion.

==Death==
===November 1932===
In November 1932, Alliluyeva was only a few weeks away from finishing her course at the academy. Alongside her compatriots, she marched in the 7 November parade commemorating the fifteenth anniversary of the October Revolution, while Stalin and the children watched her from the top of Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum on Red Square. After the parade finished, Alliluyeva complained of a headache, so the children went to their dacha outside the city while she returned to their residence in the Kremlin. The next evening both Alliluyeva and Stalin attended a dinner hosted at the Kremlin apartment of Kliment Voroshilov, a close friend of Stalin&#x27;s and a member of the Politburo, to commemorate the Revolution. Though she preferred to dress modestly in a style more in line with the Bolshevik ideology, Alliluyeva dressed up for the occasion. There was much drinking during the dinner, which had several high-ranking Bolsheviks and their spouses in attendance, and Alliluyeva and Stalin began to argue, which was not an unusual occurrence at these gatherings. It has been suggested that Stalin was also flirting with Galina Yegorova, the young wife of Alexander Yegorov, and there was recent discussion that he had been with a hairdresser who worked in the Kremlin.

Things became even worse between the two, and Montefiore suggested that when Stalin &quot;toasted the destruction of the Enemies of the State&quot;, he saw Alliluyeva did not raise her glass as well and became annoyed. Stalin supposedly threw something at her (listed variously as an orange peel, cigarette butt, or piece of bread) to get her attention, before finally calling out to her, which only further maddened Alliluyeva, who abruptly left the dinner and went outside; Zhemchuzhina followed after her to ensure someone else was there with her. The two women walked outside within the Kremlin Wall, discussing the events of the night, agreeing that Stalin was drunk, and talking about Alliluyeva&#x27;s issues with Stalin&#x27;s supposed affairs. The two parted ways and Alliluyeva returned to her residence.

Events after that are not clear, but some time early in the morning of 9 November, Alliluyeva, alone in her room, shot herself in the heart, killing herself instantly. Alliluyeva used a small Mauser pistol only recently given to her by her brother Pavel Alliluyev, who brought it as a gift from his time in Berlin. She had asked him to do so, noting that it could be dangerous alone in the Kremlin at times, and she wanted protection.

===Funeral and burial===
Stalin and the other leaders decided it would not be appropriate to say Alliluyeva had killed herself, so when her death was announced the next day, the cause of death was given as appendicitis. The children were not told the true nature of her death. To help keep the true nature of Alliluyeva&#x27;s death from being released, staff who worked in the Kremlin at the time were either dismissed or arrested, though efforts to suppress this information continued for several years afterwards. Accounts of contemporaries and Stalin&#x27;s letters indicate that he was much disturbed by the event.

&quot;Pravda&quot;, the official party newspaper, announced Alliluyeva&#x27;s death in its 10 November edition. This came as a surprise to many in the Soviet Union, as it also was the first public acknowledgement that Stalin had been married. Her body, in an open casket, was placed in an upper floor of the GUM department store, opposite Red Square and the Kremlin. Government and party officials came to visit, but the public was not allowed. The funeral was held on 12 November, with both Stalin and Vasily attending. Stalin took part in the procession to the cemetery afterwards, which involved a march from GUM to the Novodevichy Cemetery, though it is not clear if he walked the entire route. In her memoirs, Svetlana claimed that Stalin never again visited the grave.

===Aftermath===
Alliluyeva&#x27;s death had a profound impact on her children and family. Her daughter Svetlana only found out her mother had killed herself when reading an English journal article in 1942. The revelation came as a shock to her, and profoundly altered her relationship with Stalin, who had maintained the lie for a decade. She remained distant from Stalin until his death and took up her mother&#x27;s maiden name in 1957 to further distance herself from him. She ultimately defected from the Soviet Union in 1967 and died in the United States in 2011.

Her son Vasily was also greatly affected: although Alliluyeva had not played a major role in raising her children, she still showed interest in their well-being. After her death, Stalin doted upon Svetlana but virtually ignored Vasily, who began to drink from a young age and ultimately died of alcohol-related issues in 1962.

Alliluyeva&#x27;s father, Sergei, became very withdrawn after her death. He wrote memoirs which were published in 1946 after heavy editing. He died of stomach cancer in 1945. Alliluyeva&#x27;s mother, Olga, lived until 1951, dying of a heart attack. Several of Alliluyeva&#x27;s relatives were arrested and imprisoned in 1940, including her sister Anna, and Anna&#x27;s husband, Stanislav Redens, who was shot in January that year.

<text>Sergei Fyodorovich Bondarchuk (25 September 192020 October 1994) was a Soviet and Russian actor and filmmaker who was one of the leading figures of Soviet cinema in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. He is known for his sweeping period dramas, including &quot;War and Peace&quot; (1966-67), his internationally acclaimed four-part film adaptation of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s novel, and for &quot;Waterloo&quot; (1970), a Napoleonic War epic.

Bondarchuk&#x27;s work won him numerous international accolades. &quot;War and Peace&quot; won Bondarchuk, who both directed and acted in the leading role of Pierre Bezukhov, the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film (1968), and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. He was made both a Hero of Socialist Labour and a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR.

== Early life and education ==
Sergei Fyodorovich Bondarchuk was born in the village of Bilozerka (now in Kherson Raion, Kherson Oblast, Ukraine) on September 25, 1920, in the family of Orthodox Christian peasants Fyodor Petrovich and Tatyana Vasilievna (nee Tokarenko). His paternal grandfather, Pyotr Konstantinovich Bondarchuk, was ethnically Bulgarian, the grandmother, Matryona Fyodorovna Sirvulya, was Serbian. At the time of his birth, his father was serving in the Red Army. His mother, being a deeply religious person, named her son in honor of Sergius of Radonezh and baptized him in the Annunciation Monastery near Kherson. 

Bondarchuk spent his childhood in the cities of Yeysk and Taganrog, graduating from the Taganrog School Number 4 in 1938. His first performance as an actor was onstage of the Taganrog Theatre in 1937. He continued studies at the Rostov College of Arts (1938–1942). 

After his studies, he was conscripted into the Red Army during World War II against Nazi Germany. Bondarchuk took part in the initial stage of the Battle of the Caucasus, then was reorganized into the Don Front. From October 19 to December 8, 1942, he fought at Stalingrad, took part in Operation Uranus. He was decorated for his courage in battle and was discharged with honors in 1946.

== Film career ==
In 1948, Bondarchuk made his film debut in &quot;The Young Guard&quot; directed by Sergei Gerasimov. In 1952, he was awarded the Stalin Prize for the leading role in the film &quot;Taras Shevchenko&quot;; that same year, at the age of 32, he became the youngest Soviet actor ever to receive the top dignity of People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR. In 1955, he starred with his future wife Irina Skobtseva in &quot;Othello&quot;. In 1959, he made his directorial debut with &quot;Fate of a Man&quot;, based on Mikhail Sholokhov&#x27;s short story of the same name. The film was internationally acclaimed upon its release.

Bondarchuk earned international fame with his epic production of Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, which on original release totaled more than seven hours of cinema, took six years to complete and won Bondarchuk, who both directed and acted the role of Pierre Bezukhov, the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. The year after his victory, in 1969, he starred as Martin with Yul Brynner and Orson Welles in the Yugoslav epic &quot;Battle of Neretva&quot;, directed by Veljko Bulajic.

His first English-language film was 1970&#x27;s &quot;Waterloo&quot;, produced by Dino De Laurentiis. In Europe, the critics called it remarkable for the epic battle scenes and details in capturing the Napoleonic era. However, it failed at the box office. To prevent running into hurdles with the Soviet government, he joined the Communist Party in 1970. A year later, he was appointed president of the Union of Cinematographers, while he continued his directing career, steering toward political films, directing &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; before being dismissed from the semi-governmental post in 1986.

In 1973, he was the president of the Jury at the 8th Moscow International Film Festival.

In 1975, he directed &quot;They Fought for Their Country&quot;, which was entered into the 1975 Cannes Film Festival. In 1982 came &quot;Red Bells&quot;, based on John Reed&#x27;s &quot;Ten Days That Shook the World&quot; (which serves as the film&#x27;s alternative title). His 1986 film &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; was also screened at Cannes that year.

Bondarchuk&#x27;s last feature film, and his second in English, was an epic TV version of Sholokhov&#x27;s &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot;, starring Rupert Everett. It was filmed in 1992–1993 but premiered on Channel One only in November 2006, as there were disputes concerning the Italian studio that was co-producing over unfavorable clauses in his contract, which left the tapes locked in a bank vault. After his death, the film remained locked for several years until it was recovered and released in 2006.

In 1995, he was posthumously awarded an honorable diploma for contribution to cinema at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Personal life==
He first married Inna Makarova, mother to his oldest daughter, Natalya Bondarchuk (born 1950). Natalya is remembered for her role in Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Solaris&quot;.

He met his second wife Irina Skobtseva when both were appearing in &quot;Othello&quot;, and they married in 1959. They had two children, actress Yelena Bondarchuk (1962–2009) and son Fyodor (born 1967), (who starred with Bondarchuk in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;), a popular Russian film actor and director best known for his box-office hit &quot;The 9th Company&quot; (2005).

==Death==
Bondarchuk died on October 20, 1994, at the age of 74 in Moscow from myocardial infarction. Before his death, he was confessed and given communion by Hieromonk Tikhon (Shevkunov). He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. In June 2007, his wife Irina Skobtseva unveiled a bronze statue of Bondarchuk in his native Yeysk.

<text>Robert Steven &quot;Adrian&quot; Belew (born December 23, 1949) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. A multi-instrumentalist primarily known as a guitarist and singer, he is noted for his unusual approach to the instrument, his playing cited as fluid, expressive, and often resembling &quot;animal noises or mechanical rumblings&quot;.

Widely recognized as an &quot;incredibly versatile [guitar] player&quot;, Belew is perhaps best known for his tenure as guitarist and frontman in the progressive rock group King Crimson between 1981 and 2009. He has also released nearly twenty solo albums for Island Records and Atlantic Records in various styles. In addition, Belew has been a member of the intermittently active band the Bears, and fronted GaGa in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Belew has also worked extensively as a session, guest, and touring musician, including periods with Frank Zappa, David Bowie, Talking Heads, Laurie Anderson, and Nine Inch Nails, as well as contributing to hit singles by Paul Simon, Tom Tom Club, and others. His 1989 solo single &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; was a top ten hit in the United States, and his 2005 single &quot;Beat Box Guitar&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Belew has also worked in instrument design and multimedia, collaborating with Parker Guitars to help design his Parker Fly signature guitar, and designing two iOS mobile apps.

==Biography==
===Early life (1949–1977)===
Robert Steven Belew was born into a middle-class family in Covington, Kentucky, on December 23, 1949. Initially known to friends and classmates as &quot;Steve&quot;, he played drums in his adolescence, playing with the Ludlow High School marching band and later with the high school cover band the Denems. Inspired by Jimi Hendrix, he took up guitar while bedridden with mononucleosis. At the age of 17, he was further inspired after witnessing a live performance by Lonnie Mack, who later became a close friend.

Not inclined to formal music study, Belew primarily taught himself guitar by listening to records. He was not aware of the studio sound manipulation used to create particular guitar lines, and so found ways of replicating them himself manually using unusual playing techniques and effects pedals. While maturing as a player and mastering various playing styles, Belew became increasingly preoccupied with ways to avoid &quot;sounding like everybody else&quot;. He eventually found his own sound and style by learning how to make his guitar mimic sound effects such as car horns, animal noises, or industrial sounds.

In the mid-1970s, Belew began using the first name &quot;Adrian&quot; and moved to Nashville to pursue a full-time career as a professional musician. By 1977, he was playing with the regionally popular cover band Sweetheart, but wondered whether he had missed his chance to make a living with original music.

===Work with Frank Zappa (1977–1978)===
In 1977, while playing with Sweetheart at Fanny&#x27;s Bar in Nashville, Belew was discovered by Frank Zappa, who had been tipped off regarding the band&#x27;s talents by his chauffeur. Zappa approached Belew and discussed auditioning him for an upcoming tour, although Belew did not receive an official invitation to audition for the better part of a year. During this time Sweetheart split up. Once the formal invitation came, Belew flew out to Los Angeles and found himself auditioning alongside more formally trained musicians. Believing that he had performed poorly, Belew persuaded Zappa to give him a second audition, a more intimate experience which took place in Zappa&#x27;s living room. Zappa was impressed enough to hire Belew as a guitarist and vocalist for a year.

Belew toured with Zappa in 1977 and 1978, and appeared on Zappa&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot; and concert film &quot;Baby Snakes&quot;. While with Zappa, Belew was mostly credited as a rhythm guitarist, although he also played lead, melody, or noise lines, and sang lead vocals on the songs &quot;Jones Crusher&quot; and &quot;City of Tiny Lites&quot;. According to Belew, &quot;Frank either played or sang, never both at the same time, so ultimately my role became covering his parts. When he sang I played his guitar part. When he played I sang his vocal part.&quot; He also took on the role of band clown, performing impressions (such as the Bob Dylan impersonation on the song &quot;Flakes&quot;), wearing unusual clothing, and performing visual stunts. (&quot;Need someone to wear a flashing helmet and bounce around like a robot? How about Adrian? Need someone to wear a dress onstage? There&#x27;s always Adrian.&quot;)

Belew has described his year in Zappa&#x27;s band as a &quot;crash course&quot; in music theory, due to Zappa&#x27;s rigorous rehearsals and often technically demanding music; he has stated that he &quot;went to the Frank Zappa School of Rock.&quot;

===Work with David Bowie (1978–1979)===

On the recommendation of Brian Eno, David Bowie approached Belew after a Zappa concert in Berlin with an offer to hire him as a member of his touring band. Belew accepted the offer, as Zappa intended to spend the next four months editing &quot;Baby Snakes&quot;. Belew served as lead guitarist and backing vocalist on Bowie&#x27;s Isolar II world tour in 1978, as documented on the live album &quot;Stage&quot;, and also contributed to Bowie&#x27;s 1979 studio album &quot;Lodger&quot;. Twelve years later, he returned to working with Bowie, acting as musical director on his 1990 Sound+Vision Tour.

===Talking Heads, GaGa and the Tom Tom Club (1979–1982)===

In 1980, Belew formed a new band, GaGa, for which he served as the singer, guitarist, drummer, and primary songwriter. By now a frequent visitor to New York City, Belew had also befriended the New York-based new wave band Talking Heads. After being invited to join the band onstage for a performance of &quot;Psycho Killer&quot;, he became an occasional guest performer at their concerts. Around this time, Belew also met King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp at a Steve Reich concert. In July of that year, GaGa was invited to open several New York City-area concerts for Fripp&#x27;s band the League of Gentlemen.

Talking Heads and Brian Eno subsequently hired Belew to add guitar solos to several tracks on their 1980 album &quot;Remain in Light&quot;. He then joined an expanded nine-piece Talking Heads live band which toured in 1980 and 1981. These concerts were documented on the second disc of the band&#x27;s 1982 live double album &quot;The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads&quot;. Belew also played on Talking Heads member Jerry Harrison&#x27;s solo album &quot;The Red and the Black&quot; and frontman David Byrne&#x27;s &quot;The Catherine Wheel&quot;.

At this time, the internal relationships in Talking Heads were becoming strained. The band&#x27;s rhythm section, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz, allegedly approached Belew with the suggestion that he should replace Byrne as the band&#x27;s frontman, an offer which Belew immediately but politely turned down. (In his book &quot;Remain in Love&quot;, Frantz denied that this offer was ever made.) Belew did, however, go on to work with Weymouth and Frantz in Tom Tom Club. Joining them for recordings at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, Belew played guitar on the sessions for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, including the hit single &quot;Genius of Love&quot;. However, recording engineer Steven Stanley erased the majority of Belew&#x27;s solos during the mixing sessions, and Weymouth stopped talking to Belew after he asked to receive songwriting credits on the album. Belew did not play live with Tom Tom Club or contribute to any further recordings, and instead focused on other projects.

===Beginning of solo career (1981)===

Belew&#x27;s rising profile gained him a solo record contract with Island Records. During the recording of the debut Tom Tom Club album, members of GaGa joined Belew at Compass Point and backed him on a set of parallel sessions which would result in Belew&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Lone Rhino&quot; (1982). The album provided a home for GaGa material and blended various elements of Belew&#x27;s work over the past decade. It also included an instrumental duet between Belew and his four-year-old daughter Audie on piano.

===King Crimson (1981–2013)===

Adrian Belew was the frontman, second guitarist, and occasional drummer for King Crimson from 1981 to 2009, one of the longest tenures in King Crimson by any member other than founder, bandleader, and sole constant member Robert Fripp. He maintained this position despite several splits or hiatuses in group activity, notwithstanding a brief period in the early 1990s when Fripp unsuccessfully asked singer David Sylvian of Japan to front a new version of the band.

Belew&#x27;s involvement with King Crimson began while he was still involved with Talking Heads. Having been impressed by Belew&#x27;s work with GaGa and David Bowie, Fripp asked him to join a new four-piece band, at that time called Discipline. While Belew was busy with Talking Heads and associated side projects at the time, he chose to leave and join Fripp&#x27;s band due to the deteriorating relationships within Talking Heads. One of his conditions for joining the new band was that he would be allowed to continue his solo career, to which Fripp agreed.

Former King Crimson and Yes drummer Bill Bruford and New York session bassist and Chapman Stick player Tony Levin completed the Discipline lineup. During initial touring, the members of the band discussed the possibility of renaming themselves King Crimson, which they ultimately agreed to. This made Belew the first guitarist to formally play alongside Fripp within King Crimson on an equal footing (although Ian McDonald and John Wetton had occasionally contributed extra guitar to previous King Crimson recordings). He was also the first King Crimson singer to write most of his own lyrics.

The renamed band released and toured the album &quot;Discipline&quot; later in 1981. The follow-up, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Beat&quot;, proved harder to record. Finding himself responsible for the bulk of the band&#x27;s songwriting and dealing with the extra pressures of being the frontman in a high-level group, Belew argued with Fripp over the group&#x27;s approach and sound. Disagreements were mostly resolved and the band continued to find success as a live act. However, writing and recording 1984&#x27;s &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; proved yet more difficult, and Fripp opted to split the band following the conclusion of the &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot; tour later that year.

Despite these tensions, the members of this King Crimson incarnation maintained enough camaraderie and mutual respect to reunite in 1994, forming a sextet with the addition of drummer Pat Mastelotto and Warr guitarist Trey Gunn. This lineup toured successfully until 1997, releasing the 1995 album &quot;Thrak&quot; and several live recordings. From 1997 onward, Belew participated in several of the ProjeKcts, a series of King Crimson side projects active during the band&#x27;s hiatuses, in which he predominantly played electronic drums.

King Crimson was then reduced to a quartet with the departures of Bruford and Levin, subsequently releasing the albums &quot;The ConstruKction of Light&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Power to Believe&quot; (2003). After a further four-year hiatus, the band returned to active work in 2008 as a five-piece, with Levin returning to replace Gunn and Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison joining. From 2000 through 2008, King Crimson used Belew&#x27;s home studio in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, as a rehearsal space and studio.

In September 2013, Fripp announced the formation of a new King Crimson lineup which did not include Belew. Belew stated on his Facebook page that Fripp had told him that he &quot;would not be right&quot; for the new version of the band.

===Solo career, part two (1983–1986)===

Following the release of his first solo album &quot;Lone Rhino&quot; in 1982, Belew recorded a 1983 follow-up called &quot;Twang Bar King&quot;, which once again featured GaGa as backing band (now augmented by former Elvis Presley drummer Larrie Londin).

His next solo album was recorded in 1986, and was an experimental all-instrumental album of processed guitar, guitar synthesizer, and percussion called &quot;Desire Caught By the Tail&quot;. According to Belew, this album cost him his contract with Island Records due to its highly experimental nature.

From 1986 to 1989, Belew&#x27;s solo career was on hold while he concentrated on the Bears.

===The Bears (1985–1989, 1997–present)===

Following King Crimson&#x27;s breakup/entry into hiatus in 1984, Belew formed the Bears with fellow guitarist and singer Rob Fetters, drummer Chris Arduser, and bass guitarist Bob Nyswonger. All three were close friends of Belew whom he had met during his Sweetheart days in the mid-1970s, and were also ex-members of the Raisins, a Cincinnati-based band that had some local success in the early 1980s and had an album produced by Belew.

As a band, the Bears was a conscious attempt to create a more unified and collective group, with Belew and Fetters sharing lead vocal duties. Although Belew&#x27;s guitar skills were still in evidence, they took second place to the band&#x27;s commitment to songs. Signing to the I.R.S. Records subsidiary Primitive Man Recording Company, the Bears recorded and released two albums, 1987&#x27;s &quot;The Bears&quot;, and 1988&#x27;s &quot;Rise and Shine&quot;. After three years of constant recording, promotion, and touring, the band broke up in 1989 following the collapse of PMRC. The success of Belew&#x27;s solo hit single &quot;Oh Daddy&quot; led to him touring with David Bowie. The remaining three Bears regrouped as psychodots.

All four musicians remained friends, stayed in contact with each other, and continued to help each other. Arduser drummed on Belew&#x27;s 1992 solo album, &quot;Inner Revolution&quot; (with Fetters joining the 1992 touring band). On the tour supporting Belew&#x27;s &quot;Here&quot; album in 1994, psychodots played as both the opening act and as Belew&#x27;s backing band. Belew would also co-write two songs on Rob Fetters&#x27; &quot;Lefty Loose – Righty Tight&quot; album in 1998.

Starting in 1997, the Bears regularly reunited in the studio for intermittent recording sessions. This resulted in two further albums, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Car Caught Fire&quot;, and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Eureka&quot;. The band performed short tours to promote these releases, and continued to work together around its members varied schedules. Drummer Chris Arduser died on September 27, 2023.

===Solo career, part three (1989–present)===

Belew revived his solo career with 1989&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Music Head&quot;, on which he played virtually all the instruments (with the exception of double bass). The album was split between relatively straightforward pop and more experimental songs, with a strong emphasis on Belew&#x27;s signature electric tones, plus plenty of percussion and an unusual approach to acoustic production. &quot;Mr. Music Head&quot; also generated a hit single (No. 5 on the US Modern Rock chart) in the shape of &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;, on which Belew duetted with his 11-year-old daughter Audie.

In 1990, Belew produced a similar follow-up with &quot;Young Lions&quot;. This featured a number of cover versions, plus two guest appearances by his past and current employer David Bowie, who&#x27;d hired Belew as musical director for his then-current Sound+Vision Tour. The album generated another US Modern rock chart hit (No. 2) with the Belew-and-Bowie duet &quot;Pretty Pink Rose&quot;, and a minor hit on the same chart with the subsequent single, &quot;Men In Helicopters&quot; (No. 17).

The following year, Belew released &quot;Desire of the Rhino King&quot;, a compilation of digitally remastered material from his first three (now out-of-print) albums.

The next phase in Belew&#x27;s career saw him pursuing a more traditional singing and songwriting style (albeit with his trademark unusual guitar tones), which owed a lot to his old heroes the Beatles. 1992&#x27;s &quot;Inner Revolution&quot;, and 1994&#x27;s &quot;Here&quot; (as well as 1993&#x27;s self-explanatory and back-catalogue-revisiting &quot;The Acoustic Adrian Belew&quot;) were all heavily song-oriented and accessible, but sold less than Belew expected. 1996&#x27;s &quot;Op Zop Too Wah&quot; blended Belew&#x27;s songwriting approach with more avant-garde instrumental parts.

In parallel to Belew&#x27;s work with a revived King Crimson, he released the first in a proposed Experimental Guitar Series, &quot;The Guitar as Orchestra: Experimental Guitar Series, Vol. 1&quot;, in 1997. This was an album of atonal contemporary classical music entirely realized on MIDI guitar using digital models of orchestral instruments. Belew has mentioned plans for releasing more records in the Experimental Guitar series, including one called &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, but no more yet have been released.
Belew&#x27;s subsequent releases were two more acoustic albums, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Belew Prints: The Acoustic Adrian Belew, Vol. 2&quot;, and the 1999 &quot;Salad Days&quot; compilation, as well as the &quot;Coming Attractions&quot; album of works-in-progress. In 2004, he collaborated on a spoken-word-and-instrumentation album with Kevin Max, called &quot;Raven Songs 101&quot;. Between 2005 and 2007, Belew released the &quot;Side&quot; series of albums: 2005&#x27;s &quot;Side One&quot; and &quot;Side Two&quot;, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Side Three&quot;, and 2007&#x27;s &quot;Side Four&quot;, with a variety of guest performers, including Tool&#x27;s Danny Carey and Primus&#x27; Les Claypool.

In April and May 2006, Adrian toured Australia with local musicians John Prior from Matt Finish playing drums, and Al Slavik playing bass guitar and Stick (as well as singing backing vocals). In August 2006, he performed in Atlanta, Georgia, on The Acoustic Planet Tour with Bela Fleck &amp; the Flecktones and Umphrey&#x27;s McGee.

Later in 2006, Belew formed a new long-term trio, which his fans rapidly christened the Adrian Belew Power Trio, featuring former Paul Green School of Rock students Eric Slick on drums and Julie Slick on bass. This band featured on the 2007 live recording &quot;Side Four&quot; and the 2009 download-only &quot;Live Overseas&quot;.

In 2008, Belew played at the Adelaide Guitar Festival. In June 2009, the Adrian Belew Power Trio released an all-new studio record titled simply &quot;e.&quot;, featuring a five-part long-form Belew instrumental composition. During the same month, Belew released &quot;A Cup of Coffee and a Slice of Time&quot;, an album credited to &quot;Clay &amp; Belew&quot;. This was an album of improvised classical-based interpretations of Belew songs (both solo and from King Crimson) mostly performed by pianist Michael Clay, with additional guitar, cello, and music concrete contributions from Belew.

Belew has been a frequent collaborator of Nine Inch Nails, appearing on the albums &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;The Fragile&quot;, &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot;, and &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;. Bandleader Trent Reznor briefly named Belew as the group&#x27;s touring guitarist in 2013, but he ultimately left the group before playing any live dates.

On January 16, 2019, Belew announced an expansion of his &quot;Power Trio&quot; to a quartet with the addition of Saul Zonana and a 2019 tour.

In 2022, Belew participated in the &quot;Celebrating David Bowie&quot; tour, featuring Angelo Moore, Todd Rundgren, and others.

In 2023, Belew joined Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads on the Remain In Light tour, which featured music from the Talking Heads album &quot;Remain in Light&quot;.

In 2024, Belew began a tour with Tony Levin, Steve Vai, and Tool drummer Danny Carey as Beat, performing music by the 1980s incarnation of King Crimson.

===FLUX apps===

Most recently, Belew has moved into working with mobile app platforms via his self-designed iOS apps &quot;FLUX:FX – the professional audio multi-effects app&quot; and &quot;FLUX by belew&quot;, which contain over three hundred audio tracks and pieces of artwork that he describes as &quot;never playing the same twice&quot;. &quot;FLUX:FX&quot; is a real-time audio manipulation app for the iPad that he said &quot;lets me make sounds that I can&#x27;t get with any other gear.&quot; Both apps have gathered significant industry recognition, including being honored twice in the 2015 Webby Awards and receiving a &#x27;best of the best&#x27; at the 2015 Red Dot Design Awards.

==Musical style==

Although he has frequently worked as a lead singer, Belew is best known as a guitar player with a highly unusual but accessible playing style (featuring bizarre electronic tones, unorthodox playing techniques, and a wide variety of sonic effects, including guitar-based impressions of animals, birds, insects, vehicles, and mechanical noise). Among his best-known guitar parts are the chorus riff in Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot;, the riff on Tom Tom Club&#x27;s &quot;Genius of Love&quot;, the guitar solos on Talking Heads&#x27; &quot;Remain in Light&quot;, and the elephant impressions on King Crimson&#x27;s &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;.

Belew&#x27;s playing style involves extended techniques such as tapping, pick scrapes, bending the neck, unorthodox styles of slide guitar, and occasional employment of objects such as files to attack the strings. In his riffs, he generally includes fret intonation work, and is even known to produce sounds from off the fretboard, including the stringed portion of the nut and bridge. He also makes extensive use of the vibrato arm.

Belew uses a wide variety of heavily synthesized and electronically altered guitar tones. Over the years he has become known for playing various guitars processed through an immense array of electronic effects devices (&quot;I&#x27;m surrounded by guitar pedals, though. I can&#x27;t step out the ring I&#x27;m surrounded in without stepping on a pedal,&quot; he told &quot;Adelaide.now&quot; in 2008.) He has also stated that he composes specifically for certain amps and effects. Lamenting the demise of one specific amplifier made by now-defunct Johnson Amplification, he said, &quot;I wrote specific sounds and types of looping and things that I just can&#x27;t seem to make other amps do.&quot; While he has used many brands of effects pedals, Electro Harmonix was one of his mainstays.

Belew is a pioneer of guitar synthesizers, having been one of the first players to bring them to, and consistently use them in, popular music. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a user of the Roland GR-300 (alongside Andy Summers, Pat Metheny, and Robert Fripp). In the late 1980s and the 1990s, he used the Roland GR-1. He now favors the Line 6 Variax digital modelling system. In the early 1980s, Belew was notable for owning and using a rare Roland GR-505 fretless guitar synthesizer.

Belew&#x27;s first guitar was a Gibson Firebird that he bought for $170. Belew now has a signature Parker Fly guitar, the company&#x27;s first.

Belew has also been seen playing an extraordinarily flexible rubber-neck guitar in the Laurie Anderson film &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; and in the video for his 1989 single &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;. In 2007, he revealed that the guitar&#x27;s neck was rubber containing &quot;metal vertebrae&quot; and that it was solely a visual (and unplayable) prop.

Belew&#x27;s singing voice is often compared to that of Talking Heads&#x27; David Byrne. In addition to his singing and guitar playing talents, Belew is an accomplished drummer and percussionist, and also plays bass guitar, upright bass, keyboards, and cello.

Belew has cited Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Jeff Beck, Igor Stravinsky, and George Gershwin as particular influences. He has also cited comedian Spike Jones as an influence on the absurdist humor of his lyrics.

===Equipment setup===
In 2010, Guitar Geek interviewed Belew&#x27;s guitar technician André Cholmondeley, creating a list and diagram of Belew&#x27;s guitar setup at the time.

An instructional video from 1984 shows he also used an A/DA Flanger, an Electro-Harmonix Octave Multiplexer, an Electro-Harmonix 16 Second Digital Delay, an Electro-Harmonix Frequency Analyzer, two Foxx Tone Machine Fuzzes, a Boss DM-2 Delay, an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synthesizer, an MXR Dyna Comp, a Pitch-Voltage Synthesizer, three Boss volume pedals, two MXR 10-band graphic equalizers, a Roland GR-300 Guitar Synthesizer, a Boss pedal switcher, an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff, an Electro-Harmonix Foot Controller, a tape loop machine, and an Electro-Harmonix Stereo Polychorus.

Belew is always adjusting his live setup, and according to audio engineer Daniel Rowland, he uses a Fractal Audio Axe-FX II, Liquid Foot 12+ controller, Roland VG-99, Kemper Profiler, a Keeley Compressor pedal, Ableton Live (running on an Apple Macbook), Soundblox Multi-wave distortion, DigiTech HarmonyMan, iConnectMidi 4+, MOTU Ultralite 3 hybrid, Keith Mcmillen Instruments Softstep 2, and his own NOIISE FLUX:FX iPad app through the Bose L1 and Atomic monitoring wedges. This was the rig seen by fans on his 2019 tour.

==Legacy==

Many artists have expressed their admiration for Belew or have cited him as an influence, including John Frusciante, Adam Jones of Tool, Steven Wilson, Henry Rollins, St. Vincent, Anneke van Giersbergen of the Gathering, Garry Roberts of the Boomtown Rats, William Rees of Mystery Jets, Nick Reinhart of Tera Melos, Josh Christian of Toxik, and Sean Worrell of Nero di Marte. In a 1994 interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine, Trent Reznor described Belew as &quot;the most awesome musician in the world&quot;.

==Session credits and other work==

Belew is well regarded for his contributions, particularly on guitar, to various other artists&#x27; recordings.

In the 1980s, following his work with Talking Heads, Belew became an in-demand session player. Among the albums he contributed to during this period were Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Left-handed Dream&quot; in 1981, Joan Armatrading&#x27;s &quot;The Key&quot; in 1983, Peter Wolf&#x27;s &quot;Lights Out&quot; and Jean Michel Jarre&#x27;s &quot;Zoolook&quot; (both in 1984), Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;True Colors&quot; and Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; (both in 1986), and Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Earth Moving&quot; in 1989. During the mid-1980s, he frequently worked with Laurie Anderson, appearing on 1983&#x27;s &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot; album and her subsequent concert film, &quot;Home of the Brave&quot;. In his 1984 instructional video &quot;Electronic Guitar&quot;, Belew explained and demonstrated the technology and techniques used to create some of his signature music.

In 1993, Belew played &quot;synthesized guitar&quot; on the song &quot;God Shuffled His Feet&quot; by Crash Test Dummies and also contributed to Sara Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Necessary Angels&quot; album. In 1994, he established himself as Trent Reznor&#x27;s guest guitarist of choice, contributing to four Nine Inch Nails albums over the next nineteen years (&quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;, &quot;The Fragile&quot;, &quot;Ghosts I–IV&quot;, and &quot;Hesitation Marks&quot;). He worked again with Laurie Anderson on her 1994 album, &quot;Bright Red&quot;. During the 2000s, Belew was prominently featured on Tori Amos&#x27;s 2001 album of cover versions, &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot;, and played on William Shatner&#x27;s second musical album, &quot;Has Been&quot;, in 2004. In 2005, he featured as &quot;primary guitarist&quot; on the album &quot;Habitat&quot; by progressive rock band Man on Fire and contributed two solos to Porcupine Tree&#x27;s album &quot;Deadwing&quot;. In 2006 and 2007, Belew contributed to two Pink Floyd tribute albums produced by Billy Sherwood: &quot;Back Against the Wall&quot;, and &quot;Return to the Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.

In 2016, Belew scored the Pixar short film &quot;Piper&quot;, which was shown before &quot;Finding Dory&quot; in theaters. He also featured on the album &quot;The News&quot; by Italian progressive/eclectic rock band N.y.X.

==Record production==

In 1983, Belew produced the eponymous debut album for the Raisins. In 1985, he produced the Elvis Brothers&#x27; second album, &quot;Adventure Time&quot;.

During the 1990s, he began making more of a name for himself as a producer, most notably producing two tracks on Jars of Clay&#x27;s debut album in 1995 (including the crossover Christian hit &quot;Flood&quot;), but also producing the Irresponsibles&#x27; 1999 album, &quot;When Pigs Fly&quot;.

Belew has also produced and played on albums by three Mexican rock bands: Caifanes&#x27;s 1992 album, &quot;El silencio&quot;; Santa Sabina&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Símbolos&quot;, and Jaguares&#x27; 2005 album, &quot;Cronicas de un Laberinto&quot;.

Belew was credited as co-producer and musician on Kevin Max&#x27;s 2001 album, &quot;Stereotype Be&quot;.

Belew established a recording studio in his home in Williams Bay, Wisconsin in the early 1990s before relocating the studio, now named StudioBelew to the Nashville, Tennessee suburb of Mount Juliet in 1995.

==Instrument design==

Belew has also worked in instrument design, collaborating with Parker Guitars to help design his own Parker Fly signature guitar. This guitar is noticeably different from the standard design, containing advanced electronics, such as a sustainer pickup and a Line 6 Variax guitar modelling system. It is also MIDI-capable, allowing it to be used with any synthesizer with MIDI connectivity.

<text>Andrew J. Looney (born November 5, 1963) is a game designer and computer programmer. He is also a photographer, a cartoonist, a video-blogger, and a marijuana-legalization advocate.

Andrew and Kristin Looney together founded the games company Looney Labs, where Andrew is the chief creative officer. Looney Labs has published most of his game designs, such as &quot;Fluxx&quot;, &quot;Chrononauts&quot;, and the &quot;Icehouse&quot; game system. His other game designs include &quot;Aquarius&quot;, &quot;Nanofictionary&quot;, &quot;IceTowers&quot;, &quot;Treehouse&quot;, and &quot;Martian Coasters&quot;.

== Biography ==
Andrew Looney as a youth became an Eagle Scout. He entered the University of Maryland at College Park in 1981 as a freshman with an undecided major between English and computer science. He eventually selected computer science.

He and Kristin, his future spouse, met in 1986 when he started at NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center as a software programmer. Kristin was a computer engineer designing computer chips. Keeping English as a side interest, he wrote &quot;The Empty City&quot;, a science-fiction short story. Wanting a game in the story but feeling a card game as too boring, he created a fictional game, Icehouse, that used pyramids. Readers of the short story requested to learn how to play the game. Thus actual rules were invented for Icehouse, then plastic pyramid pieces were made to play the game. The pieces were made from resin in his apartment, which upset the landlord due to the smell. This led them to launch their own game company to sell the Icehouse game. After several years, Looney shut down Icehouse Games, Inc.

He and his wife launched Looney Laboratories in 1996 as a part-time home based design company. Andrew soon designed the Fluxx card game. He then went on to a brief career as a game programmer at Magnet Interactive Studios, where he created that company&#x27;s only entry to the market, &quot;Icebreaker&quot;. Aquarius was Andy&#x27;s and Labs&#x27; next game, launched in 1998. In 2002, a few years after Kristin went full-time with their company, Andy followed.

<text>Arthur Gordon Linkletter (born Gordon Arthur Kelly or Arthur Gordon Kelly; sources differ; July 17, 1912 – May 26, 2010) was a Canadian-born American radio and television personality. He was the host of &quot;House Party&quot;, which ran on CBS radio and television for 25 years, and &quot;People Are Funny&quot;, which aired on NBC radio and television for 19 years. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1942.

Old clips from Linkletter&#x27;s &quot;House Party&quot; program were later featured as segments on the first incarnation of &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot;. A series of books followed which contained the humorous comments made on-air by children. He appeared in four films.

==Early life==
Linkletter was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. In his autobiography, &quot;Confessions of a Happy Man&quot; (1960), he revealed that he had no contact with his natural parents or his sister or two brothers since he was abandoned when only a few weeks old. He was adopted by Mary (née Metzler) and Fulton John Linkletter, an evangelical preacher.

When he was five his family moved to San Diego, California, where he graduated from San Diego High School at age 16. During the early years of the Great Depression he rode trains around the country doing odd jobs and meeting a wide variety of people. In 1934 he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in teaching from San Diego State Teachers College (now San Diego State University), where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. While attending San Diego State he played for the basketball team and was a member of the swimming team. He had previously planned to attend Springfield College, but did not for financial reasons.

In 1935, he met Lois Foerster. They were married at Grace Lutheran Church in San Diego, November 28, 1935. Their marriage lasted until Linkletter&#x27;s death, 74 years later.

==Career==
===From radio into television===
After receiving his teaching degree Linkletter decided to go to work as a radio announcer at KGB in San Diego, because radio paid better than teaching. He directed radio programs for fairs and expositions in the mid-1930s. Afterwards, he moved to San Francisco and continued his radio career. In 1943, Linkletter pleaded guilty to falsely claiming US citizenship; he was fined $500 and permitted to apply for citizenship. In the 1940s, Linkletter worked in Hollywood with John Guedel on their pioneering radio show, &quot;People Are Funny&quot;, which employed audience participation, contests, and gags. The series served as a prototype for future radio and television game shows. &quot;People Are Funny&quot; became a television show in 1954 and ran until 1961.

===Early television and film appearances===
Other early television shows Linkletter worked on included &quot;Life With Linkletter&quot; with his son Jack (1969–1970) and &quot;Hollywood Talent Scouts&quot; (1965–1966). He also acted in two movies, &quot;People Are Funny&quot; (1946) and &quot;Champagne for Caesar&quot; (1950). Following an appearance in &quot;No Greater Love&quot; (1960), Linkletter ceased to appear in feature films.

Linkletter declined the opportunity offered by his friend Walt Disney to invest in the Disneyland theme park project, along with building and operating the Disneyland Hotel, due to Linkletter&#x27;s doubts about the park&#x27;s prospects. But, out of friendship for Disney, Linkletter volunteered his experience as a live program broadcaster to help organize ABC&#x27;s coverage of the Disneyland opening in 1955 on what was his 43rd birthday. Besides being an on-air host, he recruited his two co-hosts: Ronald Reagan and Bob Cummings. The park opening experience convinced Linkletter that Disneyland was going to be a huge success. When Disney asked what he could do to show his gratitude for the broadcast&#x27;s role in the successful launching of the park, Linkletter asked for Disneyland&#x27;s camera and film concession for its first ten years, a request that was quickly granted. This turned out to be extremely lucrative.

In the 1950s, Linkletter hosted a 15-minute series for syndication titled &quot;Art Linkletter and the Kids,&quot; seen locally on Saturday mornings in some areas.

On February 23, 1961, Linkletter and his son Jack Linkletter appeared together in &quot;The Bible Man,&quot; one of the last episodes of &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre,&quot; which aired for five seasons on CBS. In the storyline, Linkletter is cast as the Reverend Albert Pierce, a traveling evangelist who is estranged from his grown son, Jimmy (Jack Linkletter), because he had tried to avoid telling Jimmy of the real circumstances of the death of Jimmy&#x27;s mother. The son accused his father of causing the mother&#x27;s death by burning down her house. However, she was already dead before the fire because a paramour had beaten her to death. The episode ends with the reconciliation of father and son. &quot;The Bible Man&quot; was Jack Linkletter&#x27;s only dramatic acting appearance. It was the first of two dramatic television appearances by Art Linkletter. His second appearance came in episode 15, season 6 of the series &quot;Wagon Train&quot; in 1962 alongside Nancy Reagan. When on television, he otherwise played himself.

Linkletter appeared for two stints of two weeks each as a guest host of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in 1962 between Jack Paar&#x27;s sudden departure and Johnny Carson&#x27;s arrival as its new host.

===Toy and game promotions===
In the 1950s Linkletter became a major investor in and promoter of the hula hoop. In 1963, Linkletter became the endorser and spokesman for Milton Bradley&#x27;s &quot;The Game of Life&quot;. His picture appeared on the game&#x27;s $100,000 bills and also on the box, framed by the statement &quot;I heartily endorse this game.&quot;

==&quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s Kids&quot;==

&quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s Kids&quot; was a 1963–64 gag cartoon panel drawn by the prolific cartoonist Stan Fine and distributed by King Features Syndicate.

==Later years==
In the 1960s, Linkletter started a dance school, the Art Linkletter School of Jazz, Tap, and Ballet, in Pomona and Claremont, California.

After three public meetings in 1967, an eight-member Los Angeles City Council committee cleared Linkletter and City Council Member Tom Shepard of charges that they were linked in a scheme to influence city purchase of the &quot;financially troubled&quot; Valley Music Theater in Woodland Hills.

In 1988, he appeared as himself on the syndicated sitcom &quot;Small Wonder&quot; in the episode &quot;Come Fly With Me.&quot; At one point he was a spokesman for National Home Life, an insurance company.

===Activism===
A registered Republican who campaigned for his old friend Ronald Reagan for President of the United States, Linkletter became a political organizer and a spokesman for the United Seniors Association, now known as USA Next, an alternative to the AARP. As part of this role, Linkletter was active in campaigning for more stringent restrictions on elderly motorists. He was also a member of the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation (which ended in November 2008).

In 1978, he wrote the foreword to the bestselling self-help book &quot;Release Your Brakes!&quot; by James W. Newman, in which he wrote, &quot;I believe none of us should ever stop growing, learning, changing, and being curious about what&#x27;s going to happen next. None of us is perfect, so we should be eager to learn more and try to be more effective persons in every part of our lives.&quot;

In 2005, at the age of 93, he opened the Happiest Homecoming on Earth celebrations for the 50th anniversary of Disneyland. Half a century earlier, he had been the commentator on the opening day celebrations in 1955. For this, he was named a Disney Legend.

===Philanthropy===
Linkletter invested wisely, enabling his considerable philanthropy. A member of Pepperdine University&#x27;s Board of Regents, Linkletter was also a long-term trustee at Springfield College, where he donated funds to build the swimming center named in his honor, the Art Linkletter Natatorium.

===Awards and honors===
Linkletter received a lifetime achievement Daytime Emmy award in 2003. He was inducted into the National Speakers Association Speaker Hall of Fame. He also received honorary degrees from several universities, including his alma mater, San Diego State University; Pepperdine University; and the University of Prince Edward Island. For his contribution to television, he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located on 1560 Vine Street. Linkletter received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Lowell Thomas in 1975.

==Personal life==

Linkletter had one of the longest marriages of any well-known person in America, at nearly 75 years. It was the longest Hollywood marriage of all time (prior to his death), and it currently ranks as the third-longest Hollywood marriage of all time. He married Lois Foerster on November 25, 1935, and they had five children: Arthur Jack (known as Jack), Dawn, Robert, Sharon and Diane. Lois Foerster Linkletter survived her husband by sixteen months, dying at the age of 95 on October 11, 2011. They outlived three of their five children.

On October 4, 1969, 20-year-old Diane died after jumping out of her sixth-floor kitchen window. Linkletter claimed that her death was drug-related because she was on, or having a flashback from, an LSD trip (toxicology tests later determined there were no drugs in Diane&#x27;s system at the time of her death). After Diane&#x27;s death, Linkletter spoke out against drugs to prevent children from straying into a drug habit. On October 24, 1969, he said &quot;Anybody who has said anything which would encourage my daughter to take LSD was unwittingly a part of being her murderer.&quot; His record, &quot;We Love You, Call Collect&quot;, recorded before her death, featured a discussion about permissiveness in modern society, along with a rebuttal by Diane, titled &quot;Dear Mom and Dad&quot;. The record won a 1970 Grammy Award for the &quot;Best Spoken Word Recording&quot;.

Son Robert Linkletter died in an automobile accident on September 12, 1980. Another son, Jack Linkletter, died from lymphoma in 2007.

In early 2008, Linkletter suffered a mild stroke. He died on May 26, 2010, at age 97 at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.

After his death, Phyllis Diller stated, &quot;In a couple of months Art Linkletter would have been 98 years old, a full life of fun and goodness, an orphan who made it to the top. What a guy.&quot;

<doc id="179313" wikidata="Q3241437" url="?curid=179313" title="Lindsay, Ontario">
<text>Lindsay is a community of 22,367 people (2021 census) on the Scugog River in the Kawartha Lakes region of south-eastern Ontario, Canada. It is approximately west of Peterborough. It is located in the City of Kawartha Lakes, and is the hub for business and commerce in the region.

== History ==
The Township of Ops was surveyed in 1825 by Colonel Duncan McDonell, and Lots 20 and 21 in the 5th Concession were reserved for a town site. The same year settlers began to come to the region, and by 1827, the Purdys, an American family, built a dam on the Scugog River at the site of present-day Lindsay. The following year they built a sawmill, and in 1830, a grist mill was constructed.

A small village grew up around the mills, and it was known as Purdy&#x27;s Mills. In 1834, surveyor John Huston plotted the designated town site into streets and lots. Local lore claims that during the survey, one of Huston&#x27;s assistants, Mr. Lindsay, was accidentally shot in the leg and died of an infection. He was buried on the riverbank and his name and death were recorded on the surveyor&#x27;s plan. The name Lindsay remained as the name of the town by government approval. Lindsay grew steadily and developed into a lumbering and farming centre.

With the arrival of the Port Hope Railway in 1857, the town saw a period of rapid development and industrial growth. On June 19 of the same year, Lindsay was formally incorporated as a town. In 1861, a fire swept through the town and most of Lindsay was destroyed with hundreds of people left homeless. It took many years for Lindsay to recover from this disaster. In the late 19th century, local photographers Fowler &amp; Oliver worked out of the Sunbeam Photo Gallery. It was also the home to Sir Samuel Hughes, the Canadian Minister of Militia during the First World War. The Victoria Street Armouries were built during this time.

In 2001 Lindsay&#x27;s town government was amalgamated with Bexley Township, Bobcaygeon-Verulam, Carden-Dalton Township, Eldon Township, Emily Township, Fenelon Falls, Fenelon Township, Laxton, Digby and Longford Township, Manvers Township, Mariposa Township, Omemee, Ops Township, Somerville Township, Sturgeon Point and Woodville into the new City of Kawartha Lakes.

=== Railway ===

The first railway to arrive in Lindsay was the Port Hope, Lindsay &amp; Beaverton Railway (PHL&amp;B), originally chartered in 1846 as the Peterborough &amp; Port Hope Railway. The first train arrived at the St. Paul and King Streets station (Lindsay’s first) on the east side of the Scugog River on October 16, 1857. In 1871 it continued on over the Scugog River across a swing-bridge, gained height on the west bank, and then headed west out to Beaverton. It was renamed the Port Hope Railway in 1869.

Lindsay’s second railway began as the Fenelon Falls Railway in 1871, changing its name to the Lindsay, Fenelon Falls &amp; Ottawa River Valley Railway, and then to the Victoria Railway. It reached and terminated at Haliburton in 1878. At its Lindsay end, it connected with the original Midland Railway route on William Street North at &quot;Victoria Junction&quot; in 1875, and its original Lindsay terminus was at the PHL&amp;B/Midland station at St. Paul and King Streets. In 1877, it applied to the Town of Lindsay to extend its railway down Victoria Avenue to Glenelg Street to connect with the WPP&amp;L (see below), where a brick station (Lindsay’s second) was built on Victoria Ave between Glenelg and Melbourne Streets to serve the two railways as a union station.

Lindsay’s third railway was the Port Whitby &amp; Port Perry Railway, extended from Port Perry to Lindsay in 1876, reaching Albert Street, Lindsay on June 15, 1877 as the Whitby, Port Perry &amp; Lindsay Railway (WPP&amp;L).

In 1881, the Midland Railway acquired the neighbouring smaller railways and built two links important to Lindsay. One was between Wick (Blackwater) Jct., and Cresswell (Manilla Jct.) in early 1883 for a direct route between Lindsay and Toronto (hitherto via Lorneville Jct.); and the other (&quot;the Missing Link&quot;) between Peterborough and Omemee in late 1883, for a direct Lindsay – Peterborough connection (hitherto via Millbrook Jct.).

In Lindsay, a new entry from Omemee was then decided upon, and a bridge was built over the Scugog River at the east end of Durham St. The track now came along just south of Durham to Cambridge Street, where it curved north to connect with the former Victoria Railway on Victoria Avenue. A new station (Lindsay’s third) was built at the south end of William Street in 1883, at which time the King at St. Paul Street station was abandoned. The new station burned in 1885, and the former union station was taken back into use until 1890 when a grand new two-storey station was built (Lindsay’s fourth), that lasted until 1963. The union station was demolished around 1890. A freight shed was built on the site, which was destroyed by fire in 1954. (It was replaced by another freight shed, demolished in 2006.)

In 1887 the Midland Railway made Lindsay its operational headquarters. A large freight yard was built south of Durham between Lindsay and Hamilton Sts, and the Port Hope engine house was dismantled and rebuilt in Lindsay as a running shed, together with the attendant shops, on the east side of Albert St. south of Durham. In the meantime the old swing-bridge across the Scugog River at Lindsay and Colborne Sts. was dismantled in 1887, and the former Midland Railway route across Victoria Jct. and through what is now the Lindsay airport was abandoned when 
the new direct line from Lindsay out to Midland was built in 1907. The Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) took over the Midland in 1884, and Lindsay became a division point for the GTR’s 8th (Belleville, Peterborough and Port Hope), 9th (Midland and Coboconk) and 10th (Scarboro Jct., Whitby and Haliburton) Districts. The GTR operated a branch of The Grand Trunk Railway Literary and Scientific Society in Lindsay, including a full public library. The GTR was merged into the Canadian National Railways in 1923. (The Maynooth Sub. was added to Lindsay’s control in 1931, then at its peak as a railway centre.)

In the meantime Bobcaygeon interests had applied for, and in 1890 obtained, a charter for the Lindsay, Bobcaygeon &amp; Pontypool Railway (LB&amp;P) from Burketon Jct. (west of Pontypool) on the CPR’s then main MontrealToronto line, north to Lindsay. Construction began in 1901, and the line opened in 1904. The LB&amp;P ducked under the GTR at the Scugog River bridge, following the east bank of the river to a station at Caroline Street (Lindsay’s fifth). The last train to Bobcaygeon was in 1957.

To commemorate the 150th Anniversary, a monument was carved in front of the old town hall on Kent Street, by chainsaw carver Gerald Guenkel, of Omemee. It shows the importance of locomotives to Lindsay’s history.

== Forest fire protection history ==
Ontario&#x27;s former &quot;Department of Lands and Forests&quot; (now the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) ran one of its 17 forest fire districts from Lindsay. Formed in 1946 &quot;The Lindsay Forest Fire District&quot; served as the headquarters for the protection and study of forests in Haliburton, Victoria, Durham, Peterborough and Northumberland Counties. The Lindsay office was also responsible for the maintenance and manning of the 13 fire tower lookouts within its boundaries. The towerman&#x27;s purpose was as an early detection to protect the local forests from fire. The district&#x27;s towers included: Harburn, Bruton, Eyre, Glamorgan (Green&#x27;s Mountain), Harvey, Cardiff, Digby, Lutterworth, Sherbourne (St. Nora), Dorset, Clarke (Ganaraska Forest), Haldimand (Northumberland Forest) and Methuen (Blue Mountain). When a fire was spotted in the forest a towerman would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a &#x27;triangulation&#x27; read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. Most of these towers were put out of use in the late 1960s when aerial detection systems were put in place.

<doc id="179314" wikidata="Q193680" url="?curid=179314" title="Émile Verhaeren">
<text>Émile Adolphe Gustave Verhaeren (; 21 May 1855 – 27 November 1916) was a Belgian poet and art critic who wrote in the French language. He was one of the founders of the school of Symbolism and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature on six occasions.

==Early life==
Émile Verhaeren was born into a middle-class French-speaking family in Sint-Amands, a rural commune in Belgium&#x27;s Province of Antwerp, although he also spoke the local Dutch dialect. At the age of eleven, he was sent to a strict boarding school in Ghent run by Jesuits, the Jesuit College of Sainte Barbe, where he formed a friendship with Georges Rodenbach. He then studied law at the University of Leuven, where he produced his first literary efforts in a student paper, &quot;La Semaine&quot; (&quot;The Week&quot;), which he edited in conjunction with the opera singer Ernest van Dyck. &quot;La Semaine&quot; was suppressed by the authorities, as was its successor, &quot;Le Type&quot;, where his colleagues included Max Waller, Iwan Gilkin and Albert Giraud. His like-minded acquaintances later became his collaborators on the revolutionary artistic magazine &quot;La Jeune Belgique&quot; (&quot;Young Belgium&quot;).

Having earned his law degree, he trained from 1881–1884 under Edmond Picard, a renowned criminal lawyer and influential figure in the Brussels artistic scene. Verhaeren came into frequent contact with young, radical writers and artists at a time of artistic renewal. He spoke in only two court cases before deciding to dedicate his life to poetry and literature.

==Art criticism==
He soon became the spokesperson for the artistic revival at the turn of the century. Fascinated by the works of the painters of the artistic circle &quot;Les XX&quot;, he wrote many articles in &quot;La Jeune Belgique&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Art Moderne&quot; with flamboyant criticism on the artistic-literary works of the Brussels art world. He made himself especially the champion of the impressionist painters, and his articles brought many promising young talents, such as James Ensor and Fernand Khnopff, to the attention of the public.

Through these articles, he became a lifelong friend of the Neo-impressionist Belgian painter Théo van Rysselberghe, resulting in a vast body of letters. In one of these letters, he was described by Maria van Rysselberghe as &quot;a unique personality, a whirlwind with an indomitable character, who didn&#x27;t bother himself about bourgeois rules and who provoked or overwhelmed everybody by his straightforward directness&quot;.

==Literature==
He was one of the most prolific poets of his era. His first collection of poems, &quot;Les Flamandes&quot;, was published in 1883. Inspired by the paintings of Jacob Jordaens, David Teniers and Jan Steen, Verhaeren described in a direct and often provocative, naturalistic way his country and the Flemish people. It was an immediate success in avant-garde milieus but caused a great deal of controversy in Catholic circles. His next book, &quot;Les Moines&quot; (1886), was not the success he had hoped for. This, and his health problems, led to a deep crisis. In this period he published &quot;Les Soirs&quot; (1888), &quot;Les Débâcles&quot; (1888) and &quot;Les Flambeaux noirs&quot; (1891), all with Edmond Deman, who became his usual publisher.

On 24 August 1891 he married Marthe Massin, a talented artist from Liège. His new-found happiness found expression in three poetry books: &quot;Les Heures Claires&quot; (1896), &quot;Les Heures d&#x27;Après-midi&quot; (1905) and &quot;Les Heures du Soir&quot; (1911). His later poems include &quot;Les Rythmes souverains&quot; (1910), &quot;Les Villes à pignons&quot; (1910), &quot;Les Plaines&quot; (1911) and &quot;Les Blés Mouvants&quot; (1912).

He wrote his first play, &quot;Les Aubes&quot;, in 1898. Here he waged a fight against social injustice and the decline of life in the countryside. In 1912, he produced a tragedy, &quot;Hélène de Sparte&quot;, which was performed in German and Russian, besides French.

In 1898 he moved to Saint-Cloud, near Paris. By the turn of the century, he had become world-famous. His works were translated into more than twenty languages. His German translator was Stefan Zweig. He travelled, giving lectures, throughout Europe.

Verhaeren was an anarchist. The outbreak of World War I had a devastating effect on the poet&#x27;s deep pacifist feelings. He went to England, where he received honorary degrees from various universities. During his exile, he published &quot;Les Ailes rouges de la Guerre&quot;.

==Death==
Émile Verhaeren died on 27 November 1916 at Rouen station; he fell under a moving train while trying to board it.

St. Amands, his native city, has dedicated a museum to this giant of Belgian literature, showing many original manuscripts of his works and letters along with works of his artistic friends Théo van Rysselberghe, Léon Spilliaert, Constantin Meunier, Paul Signac and Ossip Zadkine. Verhaeren was the cousin of the painter Alfred Verhaeren.
