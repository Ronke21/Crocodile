<text>The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML ) is a social welfare organization based in Washington, D.C., that advocates for the reform of marijuana laws in the United States regarding both medical and non-medical use.

According to their website, NORML supports &quot;the removal of all penalties for the private possession and responsible use of marijuana by adults, including cultivation for personal use, and casual nonprofit transfers of small amounts&quot; and advocates for &quot;the creation of a legal and regulatory framework for marijuana&#x27;s production and retail sale to adults&quot;.

NORML also has a sister organization, NORML Foundation, that focuses on educational efforts and providing legal assistance and support to people affected negatively by current marijuana laws. NORML maintains chapters in a number of US states as well as outside the US in countries such as Canada, France, New Zealand, and South Africa.

==History==
NORML was founded in 1970 by Keith Stroup. It originally started with $5,000 in funding from the Playboy Foundation. Since then, the organization has played a central role in the cannabis decriminalization movement. At the start of the 1970s, the premier decriminalization organizations were Legalize Marijuana, better known as LeMar, and Amorphia, the two of which merged in 1971. The next year, Amorphia led the unsuccessful campaign for California&#x27;s marijuana legalization initiative, Proposition 19. In 1974, Amorphia merged with NORML.

By the middle of the 1970s, Playboy owner Hugh Hefner&#x27;s financial support through the Playboy Foundation set NORML apart from its predecessors, making it the premier decriminalization advocacy group. At one point, Hefner was donating $100,000 a year to NORML.

The organization has a large grassroots network with 135 chapters and over 550 lawyers. NORML holds annual conferences and Continuing Legal Education (CLE)-accredited seminars. Its board of directors has, at times, included political figures as Philip Hart, Jacob K. Javits, and Ross Mirkarimi.

In 1989, Donald Fiedler succeeded Jon Gettman as the executive director of NORML. In August 1992, Richard Cowan became executive director of NORML. Keith Stroup became executive director once again in 1995 after Cowan stepped down. In 2016, Erik Altieri was selected by the NORML Board of Directors to become the organization&#x27;s 7th Executive Director. In 2021, travel writer Rick Steves became the chairman of the Board of Directors.

==Media and activism==
In the 2006 United States midterm elections, NORML promoted several successful local initiatives that declared marijuana enforcement to be the lowest priority for local law enforcement, freeing up police resources to combat violent and serious crime.

In early 2009, a petition to President Barack Obama was written asking that he appoint a &quot;drug czar&quot; who would treat drug abuse as a health issue rather than a criminal issue and will move away from a &quot;War on Drugs&quot; paradigm. NORML&#x27;s goal for this petition was 100,000 signatures.

Also in early 2009, when the Kellogg Company dropped its contract with Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps after pictures of his use of a bong surfaced in the media, head members of NORML began boycotting Kellogg products and urging all members and supporters of NORML to boycott Kellogg, until the company reversed the decision. NORML also suggested that supporters of the cause send emails or letters to Kellogg explaining the boycott and the reasons behind it, and providing a template for emails and letters. Although Kellogg&#x27;s profits did not suffer in the first quarter of 2009, consumer ratings polls at Vanno have been cited as indicating that Kellogg&#x27;s reputation has suffered. Specifically, a small poll of Kellogg&#x27;s brand reputation at Vanno showed a drop from its previous rank of 9 to 83 after Kellogg decided not to renew its contract with Phelps.

On February 15, 2010, a 15-second flash animation from NORML discussing the potential economic and financial benefit of legalized marijuana was deemed by CBS to be &quot;too political&quot; to display on billboards in New York City&#x27;s Times Square. This drew criticism in the blogosphere and accusations of hypocrisy on Twitter, since CBS had recently aired an anti-abortion television spot during the 2010 Super Bowl. CBS reversed its decision and the ad was debuted on the CBS Times Square Superscreen on April 20, 2010.

==Sub-organizations==
===NORML Foundation===
The NORML Foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization that conducts educational and research activities. Examples of the NORML Foundation&#x27;s advocacy work is a detailed 2006 report, &quot;Emerging Clinical Applications For Cannabis&quot;. A comprehensive report with county-by-county marijuana arrest data, &quot;Crimes of Indiscretion: Marijuana Arrest in America&quot;, was published in 2005.

In October 1998, NORML Foundation published the &quot;NORML Report on U.S. Domestic Marijuana Production&quot; that was widely cited in the mainstream media. The report methodically estimated the value and number of cannabis plants grown in 1997, finding that Drug Enforcement Administration, state and local law enforcement agencies seized 32% of domestic cannabis plants planted that year. According to the report, &quot;Marijuana remains the fourth largest cash crop in America despite law enforcement spending an estimated $10 billion annually to pursue efforts to outlaw the plant.&quot; Recent studies show that marijuana is larger than all other cash crops combined.

In 2002, the organization used ads containing quotes by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg on his past use of cannabis, saying &quot;You bet I did. And I enjoyed it.&quot; The mayor said &quot;I&#x27;m not thrilled they&#x27;re using my name. I suppose there&#x27;s that First Amendment that gets in the way of me stopping it,&quot; but maintained that the NYPD will continue to vigorously enforce the laws.

<text>The Unna () district is a Kreis (district) in central North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Neighboring authorities are the district of Coesfeld, the city of Hamm, the districts of Soest and Märkischer Kreis, the cities of Hagen and Dortmund, and the district of Recklinghausen.

==History==
The area of the present district of Unna was formerly part of the County of the Mark, which later belonged to Prussia. In 1753 local government of the area was reformed, creating the first district of Hamm. During the French occupation of the Napoleonic period it was included in the Ruhr département, but once returned to the rule of Prussia, the district of Hamm was recreated, although with several changes.

In 1901 the town of Hamm itself became a separate urban authority, but the district retained the name of, and its administration continued to be located in Hamm until 1929. In that year the administration was moved to Unna, when the district name also changed to Unna to reflect the new administrative centre. Later organizational changes, the latest of which was in 1975, added the towns of Lünen, Schwerte, Selm and Werne to form the district as it is today.

==Geography==

Geographically the district of Unna covers the area east of Dortmund, thus marking the east end of the Ruhrgebiet. Both the Ruhr and Lippe rivers flow through it.

==Coat of arms==
The district coat of arms combines two charges relating to the Counts of the Mark, the red and white/silver checked base (referring to the fess in the counts&#x27; arms), and the red lion of Berg.

<doc id="184495" wikidata="Q857212" url="?curid=184495" title="Biefeld–Brown effect">
<text>The Biefeld–Brown effect is an electrical phenomenon, first noticed by inventor Thomas Townsend Brown in the 1920s, where high voltage applied to the electrodes of an asymmetric capacitor causes a net propulsive force toward the smaller electrode. Brown believed this effect was an anti-gravity force, and referred to as &quot;electrogravitics&quot; based on it being an electricity/gravity phenomenon. It has since been determined that the force is due to ionic wind that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles.

==Overview==

It is generally assumed that the Biefeld–Brown effect produces an ionic wind that transfers its momentum to surrounding neutral particles. It describes a force observed on an asymmetric capacitor when high voltage is applied to the capacitor&#x27;s electrodes. Once suitably charged up to high DC potentials, a thrust at the negative terminal, pushing it away from the positive terminal, is generated. 

The use of an asymmetric capacitor, with the negative electrode being larger than the positive electrode, allowed for more thrust to be produced in the direction from the low-flux to the high-flux region compared to a conventional capacitor. These asymmetric capacitors became known as Asymmetrical Capacitor Thrusters (ACT). The Biefeld–Brown effect can be observed in ionocrafts and lifters, which utilize the effect to produce thrust in the air without requiring any combustion or moving parts.

== History ==
The &quot;Biefeld–Brown effect&quot; was the name given to a phenomenon observed by Thomas Townsend Brown while he was experimenting with X-ray tubes during the 1920s while he was still in high school. When he applied a high voltage electrical charge to a Coolidge tube that he placed on a scale, Brown noticed a difference in the tube&#x27;s mass depending on orientation, implying some kind of net force. This discovery caused him to assume that he had somehow influenced gravity electronically and led him to design a propulsion system based on this phenomenon. On 15 April 1927, he applied for a patent, entitled &quot;Method of Producing Force or Motion,&quot; that described his invention as an electrical-based method that could control gravity to produce linear force or motion. In 1929, Brown published an article for the popular American magazine &quot;Science and Invention&quot;, which detailed his work. The article also mentioned the &quot;gravitator,&quot; an invention by Brown which produced motion without the use of electromagnetism, gears, propellers, or wheels, but instead using the principles of what he called &quot;electro-gravitation.&quot; He also claimed that the asymmetric capacitors were capable of generating mysterious fields that interacted with the Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull and envisioned a future where gravitators would propel ocean liners and even space cars.

At some point this effect also gained the moniker &quot;Biefeld–Brown effect&quot;, probably coined by Brown to claim Denison University professor of physics and astronomy Paul Alfred Biefeld as his mentor and co-experimenter. Brown attended Denison in Ohio for a year before he dropped out and records of him even having an association with Biefeld are sketchy at best. Brown claimed that he did a series of experiments with professor of astronomy Biefeld, a former teacher of Brown whom Brown claimed was his mentor and co-experimenter at Denison University.As of 2004, Denison University claims they have no record of any such experiments, or of any association between Brown and Biefeld.

In his 1960 patent titled &quot;Electrokinetic Apparatus,&quot; Brown refers to electrokinesis to describe the Biefeld–Brown effect, linking the phenomenon to the field of electrohydrodynamics (EHD). Brown also believed the Biefeld–Brown effect could produce an anti-gravity force, referred to as &quot;electrogravitics&quot; based on it being an electricity/gravity phenomenon. However, there is little evidence that supports Brown&#x27;s claim on the effect&#x27;s anti-gravity properties. Brown&#x27;s patent made the following claims:

# There is a negative correlation between the distance between the plates of the capacitor and the strength of the effect, where the shorter the distance, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the dielectric strength of the material between the electrodes and the strength of the effect, where the higher the strength, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the area of the conductors and the strength of the effect, where the greater the area, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the voltage difference between the capacitor plates and the strength of the effect, where the greater the voltage, the greater the effect.
# There is a positive correlation between the mass of the dielectric material and the strength of the effect, where the greater the mass, the greater the effect.

In 1965, Brown filed a patent that claimed that a net force on the asymmetric capacitor can exist even in a vacuum. However, there is little experimental evidence that serves to validate his claims.

==Effect analysis==
The effect is generally believed to rely on corona discharge, which allows air molecules to become ionized near sharp points and edges. Usually, two electrodes are used with a high voltage between them, ranging from a few kilovolts and up to megavolt levels, where one electrode is small or sharp, and the other larger and smoother. The most effective distance between electrodes occurs at an electric potential gradient of about 10 kV/cm, which is just below the nominal breakdown voltage of air between two sharp points, at a current density level usually referred to as the saturated corona current condition. This creates a high field gradient around the smaller, positively charged electrode. Around this electrode, ionization occurs, that is, electrons are stripped from the atoms in the surrounding medium; they are literally pulled right off by the electrode&#x27;s charge.

This leaves a cloud of positively charged ions in the medium, which are attracted to the negative smooth electrode by Coulomb&#x27;s Law, where they are neutralized again. This produces an equally scaled opposing force in the lower electrode. This effect can be used for propulsion (see EHD thruster), fluid pumps and recently also in EHD cooling systems. The velocity achievable by such setups is limited by the momentum achievable by the ionized air, which is reduced by ion impact with neutral air. A theoretical derivation of this force has been proposed (see the external links below).

However, this effect works using either polarity for the electrodes: the small or thin electrode can be either positive or negative, and the larger electrode must have the opposite polarity. On many experimental sites it is reported that the thrust effect of a lifter is actually a bit stronger when the small electrode is the positive one. This is possibly an effect of the differences between the ionization energy and electron affinity energy of the constituent parts of air; thus the ease of which ions are created at the &#x27;sharp&#x27; electrode.

As air pressure is removed from the system, several effects combine to reduce the force and momentum available to the system. The number of air molecules around the ionizing electrode is reduced, decreasing the quantity of ionized particles. At the same time, the number of impacts between ionized and neutral particles is reduced. Whether this increases or decreases the maximum momentum of the ionized air is not typically measured, although the force acting upon the electrodes reduces, until the glow discharge region is entered. The reduction in force is also a product of the reducing breakdown voltage of air, as a lower potential must be applied between the electrodes, thereby reducing the force dictated by Coulomb&#x27;s Law.

During the glow discharge regime, the air becomes a conductor. Though the applied voltage and current will propagate at nearly the speed of light, the movement of the conductors themselves is almost negligible. This leads to a Coulomb force and change of momentum so small as to be zero.

Below the glow discharge region, the breakdown voltage increases again, whilst the number of potential ions decreases, and the chance of impact lowers. Experiments have been conducted and found to both prove and disprove a force at very low pressure. It is likely that the reason for this is that at very low pressures, only experiments which used very large voltages produced positive results, as a product of a greater chance of ionization of the extremely limited number of available air molecules, and a greater force from each ion from Coulomb&#x27;s Law; experiments which used lower voltages have a lower chance of ionization and a lower force per ion. Common to positive results is that the force observed is small in comparison to experiments conducted at standard pressure.

==Disputes surrounding electrogravity and ion wind==
Brown believed that his large, high voltage, high capacity capacitors produced an electric field strong enough to marginally interact with the Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull, a phenomenon he labeled electrogravitics. Several researchers claim that conventional physics cannot adequately explain the phenomenon. The effect has become something of a cause célèbre in the UFO community, where it is seen as an example of something much more exotic than electrokinetics. William L. Moore and Charles Berlitz devoted an entire chapter of their book on the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot; to a retelling of Brown&#x27;s early work with the effect, implying he had discovered a new electrogravity effect and that it was being used by UFOs.

There have been follow-ups on the claims that this force can be produced in a full vacuum, meaning it is an unknown anti-gravity force, and not just the more well known ion wind. As part of a study in 1990, U.S. Air Force researcher R. L. Talley conducted a test on a Biefeld–Brown-style capacitor to replicate the effect in a vacuum. Despite attempts that increased the driving DC voltage to about 19 kV in vacuum chambers up to 10−6 torr, Talley observed no thrust in terms of static DC potential applied to the electrodes. In 2003, NASA scientist Jonathan Campbell tested a lifter in a vacuum at 10−7 torr with a voltage of up to 50 kV, only to observe no movement from the lifter. Campbell pointed out to a &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reporter that creating a true vacuum similar to space for the test requires tens of thousands of dollars in equipment.

Around the same time in 2003, researchers from the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) tested the Biefeld–Brown effect by building four different-sized asymmetric capacitors based on simple designs found on the Internet and then applying a high voltage of around 30 kV to them. According to their report, the researchers wrote that the effects of ion wind was at least three orders of magnitude too small to account for the observed force on the asymmetric capacitor in the air. Having proposed that the Biefeld–Brown effect could theoretically be explained using ion drift instead of ion wind due to how the former involves collisions instead of ballistic trajectories, they noted these were only &quot;scaling estimates&quot; and more experimental and theoretical work was needed.

Around ten years later, researchers from the Technical University of Liberec conducted experiments on the Biefeld–Brown effect that supported one of ARL&#x27;s hypotheses that assigned ion drift as the most likely source of the generated force.

In 2004, Martin Tajmar published a paper that also failed to replicate Brown&#x27;s work and suggested that Brown may have instead observed the effects of a corona wind triggered by insufficient outgassing of the electrode assembly in the vacuum chamber and therefore misinterpreted the corona wind effects as a possible connection between gravitation and electromagnetism.

==Patents==
T. T. Brown was granted a number of patents on his discovery:
* GB300311 — A method of and an apparatus or machine for producing force or motion (accepted 1928-11-15)
* — Electrostatic motor (1934-09-25)
* — Electrokinetic apparatus (1960-08-16)
* — Electrokinetic transducer (1962-01-23)
* — Electrokinetic generator (1962-02-20)
* — Electrokinetic apparatus (1965-06-01)
* — Electric generator (1965-07-20)

Historically, numerous patents have been granted for various applications of the effect, including electrostatic dust precipitation, air ionizers, and flight. was granted to G.E. Hagen in 1964 for apparatus more or less identical to the later so-called &#x27;lifter&#x27; devices.

<text>The Wonders of the Invisible World was a book written by Cotton Mather and published in 1693. It was subtitled, &quot;Observations As well Historical as Theological, upon the Nature, the Number, and the Operations of the Devils&quot;. The book defended Mather&#x27;s role in the witchhunt conducted in Salem, Massachusetts. It espoused the belief that witchcraft was an evil magical power. Mather saw witches as tools of the devil in Satan&#x27;s battle to &quot;overturn this poor plantation, the Puritan colony&quot;, and prosecution of witches as a way to secure God&#x27;s blessings for the colony.

Its arguments are largely derivative of &quot;Saducismus Triumphatus&quot; by Joseph Glanvill. A copy of Glanvill&#x27;s book was in Mather&#x27;s library when he died.

Robert Calef published a refutation of Mather&#x27;s book in 1700.

==Summary==
Cotton Mather was born in 1663. After graduating from Harvard College, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, becoming pastor of the Second Church of Boston. He continued in this role from 1685 until his death in 1728.

Mather began with an explanation of how the people of God were living in the devil&#x27;s territories. He discussed the devil&#x27;s plan to overturn the plantation and churches with the help of witches.

&quot;&quot;...An army of devils is horribly broke in upon the place which is the center, and after a sort, the first-born of our English settlements...&quot;

Mather prefaced the trials by saying he would recount them as a historian. One of the trials included was Martha Carrier&#x27;s, who was &quot;[t]he person of whom the confessions of the witches, and of her own children among the rest, agreed that the devil had promised her she should be Queen of the Hebrews.&quot; Mather presented testimonies against Martha Carrier, all of which presumed her to be guilty.

==Analysis==

===Point of view===
Mather presented himself as an unbiased informer to the reader. He received his information from court records. He did not present defenses against the testimonies given.

===Language===
Mather’s background as a minister showed in his references to religion. Mather went into details on the traditional religious view of the Devil and witchcraft.

Puritan colonists feared the perceived witches among themselves , &quot;and the houses of the good people are filled with the doleful shrieks of their children and servants, tormented by invisible hands.&quot;.

==Legacy==
Mather&#x27;s book inspired the title of the 2006 album &quot;Last Days of Wonder&quot; by Chicago band The Handsome Family; lyricist Rennie Sparks has stated she was intrigued by what she called its &quot;madness brimming under the surface of things.&quot;

<doc id="184504" wikidata="Q708525" url="?curid=184504" title="Jacob Frank">
<text>Jacob Joseph Frank (; Yiddish: יעקבֿ פֿראַנק; ; born Jakub Lejbowicz; 1726 – 10 December 1791) was a Polish-Jewish religious leader who claimed to be the reincarnation of the self-proclaimed messiah Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and also of the biblical patriarch Jacob. The Jewish authorities in Poland excommunicated Frank and his followers due to his heretical doctrines that included deification of himself as a part of a trinity and other controversial concepts such as neo-Carpocratian &quot;purification through transgression&quot;.

Frank arguably created a religious movement, now referred to as Frankism, which incorporated aspects of Christianity and Judaism. The development of Frankism was one of the consequences of the messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi. This religious mysticism followed socioeconomic changes among the Jews of Poland, Lithuania and Ruthenia.

==Historical background==
There were numerous outbreaks of followers of Sabbatai Zevi, known as Dönmeh, in Eastern Poland (now Ukraine), particularly in Podolia and Galicia, between the late 17th and the early 18th century.

In expectation of the great Messianic revolution, the members of these societies violated Jewish laws and customs. The mystical cult of the Sabbateans is believed to have included both asceticism and sensuality: some did penance for their sins, subjected themselves to self-inflicted pain, and &quot;mourned for Zion&quot;; others disregarded the strict rules of modesty required by Judaism, and at times were accused of being licentious, or even committing ritual incest. The Polish rabbis attempted to place the &quot;Sabbatean heresy&quot; in herem at the assembly at Lwów (now Lviv in Ukraine) in 1722. Still, they could not fully succeed, as it was widely popular among the nascent Jewish middle class.

==Early life==
Jacob Frank is believed to have been born as Jakub Lejbowicz (Yankev Leybovitsh) to a Jewish family in Korołówka, in Podolia of Eastern Poland (now in Ukraine), in about 1726. The Polish historian Gaudenty Pikulski affirmed that Frank was born in Buchach and Agnon even showed the house where he was born was located on Korołówka street in Buchach. His father was a Sabbatean, and moved to Czernowitz, in the Carpathian region of Bukovina, in 1730, where the Sabbatean influence at the time was strong.

As a travelling merchant in textile and precious stones Jacob Frank often visited Ottoman territories, where he earned the nickname &quot;Frank&quot;, a name generally given in the East to Europeans, and lived in the centers of contemporary Sabbateanism, Salonica and Smyrna.

In the early 1750s, Frank became intimate with the leaders of the Sabbateans. Two followers of the Sabbatian leader Osman Baba (b. 1720) were witnesses at his wedding in 1752. In 1755, he reappeared in Podolia, gathered a group of local adherents, and began to preach the &quot;revelations&quot; which were communicated to him by the Dönmeh in Salonica. One of these gatherings in Lanckorona (Landskron) ended in a scandal, and the rabbis&#x27; attention was drawn to the new teachings. Frank was forced to leave Podolia, while his followers were hounded and denounced to the local authorities by the rabbis (1756). At the rabbinical court held in the village of Satanów (today Sataniv in Ukraine) the Sabbateans were accused of having broken fundamental Jewish laws of morality and modesty.

==The anti-Talmudists==

Consequent to these disclosures the congress of rabbis in Brody proclaimed a universal &quot;herem&quot; (excommunication) against all &quot;impenitent heretics&quot;, and made it obligatory upon every pious Jew to seek them out and expose them. The Sabbateans informed Mikołaj Dembowski, the Catholic Bishop of Kamieniec Podolski, Poland, that they rejected the Talmud and recognized only the sacred book of Kabbalah, the Zohar, which did not contradict the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. They stated that they regarded the Messiah-Deliverer as one of the embodiments of the three divinities.

The bishop took Frank and his followers (the &quot;Anti-Talmudists&quot;, or &quot;Zoharistic Jews&quot;) under his protection and in 1757 arranged a religious disputation between them and the rabbis of the traditionalist community. The Anti-Talmudists presented their theses, which began the intense dispute. The bishop sided in favour of the Frankists and also ordered the burning of all copies of the Talmud in Poland. 10,000 volumes were destroyed, which was a tremendous loss for the Jewish libraries of that era.

After the death of the bishop, the Sabbateans were subjected to severe persecution by the rabbis, although they succeeded in obtaining an edict from Augustus III of Poland guaranteeing them safety.

==Declaration of being a successor to Sabbatai Zevi==

At this critical moment Jacob Frank came to Iwania, proclaimed himself as a direct successor to Sabbatai Zevi and Otman Baba, and assured his adherents that he had received revelations from Heaven. These revelations called for the conversion of Frank and his followers to the Christian religion, which was to be a visible transition stage to the future &quot;das&quot; or religion to be revealed by Frank. In 1759 negotiations looking toward the conversion of the Frankists to Roman Catholicism were being actively carried on with the higher representatives of the Polish Church; at the same time the Frankists tried to secure another discussion with the rabbis. The Polish primate Łubieński and the papal nuncio Nicholas Serra were suspicious of the aspirations of the Frankists, but at the insistence of the administrator of the bishopric of Lwów, the canon Mikulski, the discussion was arranged. It was held in Lwów and was presided over by Mikulski. Protestant missionaries also tried to detour the Frankists to Protestantism, and a handful did join the Moravian Church.

==Baptism of the Frankists==
At the discussion in 1759, the rabbis energetically repulsed their opponents. After the discussion the Frankists were requested to demonstrate in practice their adherence to Christianity; Jacob Frank, who had then arrived in Lwów, encouraged his followers to take the decisive step. The baptism of the Frankists was celebrated with great solemnity in the churches of Lwów, with members of the Polish szlachta (nobility) acting as god-parents. The neophytes adopted the names of their godfathers and godmothers, and ultimately joined their ranks. Frank himself was baptized in Lwów (17 September 1759) and again in Warsaw the next day, with King Augustus III as his godfather. Frank&#x27;s baptismal name was &quot;Joseph&quot; (&quot;Józef&quot;). In the course of one year more than 500 individuals were converted to Christianity at Lwów, and nearly a thousand in the following year. By 1790, 26,000 Jews were recorded baptised in Poland.

However, the Frankists continued to be viewed with suspicion due to their strange doctrines. Frank was arrested in Warsaw on 6 February 1760 and delivered to the Church&#x27;s tribunal on the charge of heresy. He was convicted of teaching heresy, and imprisoned in the monastery of Częstochowa.

==Prison and later days==

Frank&#x27;s imprisonment lasted thirteen years, yet it only increased his influence with the sect by surrounding him with the aura of martyrdom. Many Frankists established themselves near Częstochowa, and kept up constant communication with their &quot;holy master&quot;. Frank inspired his followers through mystical speeches and epistles, in which he stated that salvation could be gained only by first adopting the &quot;religion of Edom&quot; and later adopting a future religion which Frank called &quot;daas&quot; (&quot;daat&quot;, or Knowledge in Hebrew). After the first partition of Poland, Frank was released by the Russian general Bibikov, who had occupied Częstochowa, in August 1772.

Frank lived in the Moravian town of Brno until 1786, surrounded by a retinue of adherents and pilgrims who came from Poland. His daughter Eve began to play an important role in the sect at this time. Frank kept a force of armed men at his &quot;court&quot;. The future czar Paul I of Russia visited him together with Joseph II of Austria.

Accompanied by his daughter, Frank repeatedly traveled to Vienna, and succeeded in gaining the favor of the court. Maria Theresa regarded him as a disseminator of Christianity among the Jews, and it is even said that Joseph II was favorably inclined to the young Eve Frank. Ultimately Frank was deemed unmanageable and he was obliged to leave Austria. He moved with his daughter and his retinue to Offenbach, in Germany, where he assumed the title of &quot;Baron of Offenbach,&quot; and lived as a wealthy nobleman, receiving financial support from his Polish and Moravian followers, who made frequent pilgrimages to Offenbach. On the death of Frank in 1790, Eve became the &quot;holy mistress&quot; and leader of the sect. Her fortunes dwindled in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, and she died in Offenbach in 1816.

Some Frankists were active during the French Revolution, such as Moses Dobruška, a son of Frank&#x27;s Sabbatian cousin in Offenbach Shendl Dobruska. Many of the Frankists saw Napoleon Bonaparte as a potential Messiah. The Frankists scattered in Poland and Bohemia eventually intermarried into the gentry and middle class. Maria Szymanowska, a piano virtuoso, came from a Frankist family. Wanda Grabowska, the mother of Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, also descended from Frankists.

In 1883, a Russian magazine &quot;Русская старина&quot; (&quot;Russian Old Times&quot;) issued memoirs of an influential official of the Russian Ministry of the Interior, the privy councillor and staunch anti-Semite O. A. Pzhetslavsky. He promulgated the allegations that the mothers of &quot;three of the greatest men of Poland&quot; (Frédéric Chopin, Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki) were converted Jews from the Frankist sect. Similar assertions were put forth by Mieses and Balaban.

==Notable Sabbatian teachers of Jakob Frank==
* Rabbi Issohar, one of Frank&#x27;s principal teachers. A disciple of Hayim Malakh, Frank studied with him in İzmir in 1750–1752.
* Rabbi Mordechai ben Elias Margalit of Prague (Mardocheusz in Polish), another of Frank&#x27;s principal teachers. He helped introduce Frank to the practices of the Karakashi sect of the Dönmeh in the Turkish empire, which worshipped Beruchiah Russo (also known as Otman Baba). Frank traveled with him to Salonika in November 1753. He left Bohemia and moved to the Ottoman Empire after Jakob Frank&#x27;s uncle Moses Meir Kamenker was caught smuggling Sabbatian literature into Germany in 1725. Mordechai allegedly engaged in adultery and other antinomian conduct.
* Leib, a Jewish Sabbatian teacher of Frank&#x27;s during the latter&#x27;s childhood in Wallachia and Moldavia. He was also a wonderworker who attempted to dispel demons.

<text>Valdemar I Knudsen (14 January 1131 – 12 May 1182), also known as Valdemar the Great (), was King of Denmark from 1154 until his death in 1182. The reign of King Valdemar I saw the rise of Denmark, which reached its medieval zenith under his son King Valdemar II.
==Childhood==
Valdemar was the son of Canute Lavard, Duke of Schleswig, the chivalrous and popular eldest son of King Eric I of Denmark. Valdemar&#x27;s father was murdered by King Magnus I of Sweden days before the birth of Valdemar; his mother, Ingeborg of Kiev, daughter of Grand Prince Mstislav I of Kiev and Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden, named him after her grandfather, Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev.

Valdemar was raised at Ringsted in the court of Danish nobleman Asser Rig of Fjenneslev (–1151). Asser was a member of the Hvide noble family and had been raised together with Valdemar&#x27;s father Canute Lavard. Valdemar was raised together with Asser&#x27;s sons, including Absalon (–1201), who would become an archbishop and go to battle with Valdemar, and Esbern Snare (1127–1204), who was a royal chancellor and crusader. Esbern and Absalon had a close relationship and formed an alliance with Valdemar.

==Struggle for the throne==
In 1146, when Valdemar was fifteen years old, King Eric III of Denmark abdicated and a civil war erupted. Valdemar was a possible contender to the throne. The other pretenders to the throne were: Sweyn III Grathe, the son of King Eric II of Denmark, and Canute V, the son of Magnus I of Sweden, both of whom declared themselves King of Denmark in 1146. The civil war lasted the better part of ten years. In 1154, Valdemar joined with Canute and was recognized as co-king along with Canute. In July 1157, a temporary compromise was struck in which the three agreed to divide the country among themselves as co-regents in shifting alliances.

Canute was killed at the Bloodfeast of Roskilde in August 1157. Sweyn was defeated by Valdemar in the Battle of Grathe Heath (&quot;Slaget på Grathe Hede&quot;) on 23 October 1157. Sweyn was killed during flight, supposedly by a group of peasants who stumbled upon him as he was fleeing from the battlefield. Valdemar, having outlived all his rival pretenders, became the sole king of Denmark.

==Sole reign==
In 1158, Absalon was elected bishop of Roskilde, and King Valdemar made him his chief advisor. The king reorganized and rebuilt war-torn Denmark. He strengthened the Dannevirke fortifications to the south, He built Sønderborg Castle as a fortified fortress, constructed on an islet in the Als Strait that later was connected to Als Island. He reinvented Viking raiding tactics of old to deal with the Wends to the south, which was now optimized for heavy cavalry; this use of amphibious assault was further improved upon by his successor Canute VI.

At Absalon&#x27;s instigation, he declared war upon the Wends who were raiding the Danish coasts. They occupied Pomerania and the island of Rügen in the Baltic Sea and were a definite threat to the Danes in the Baltic as the Wends outnumbered the Danes more than two to one. So the Danes soon began raiding the Wendish coasts in turn; this culminated in the conquest of Rügen, which was used as another base to raid and later conquer more Wendish territory. Danish influence had therefore reached both Pomerania and the Obotrite confederacy, both being raided routinely by the Danes. Around the year 1170, a smaller contingent of the Danish fleet (headed by Valdemar and Absalon) ventured past the mouth of the Oder, where they were ambushed by a Wendish army and fleet under Casimir, at the Julin bridge (modern-day Wolin) hoping to end Danish raiding. But the Danes outsmarted the Wends and smashed their army and fleet, primarily due to the Danish ships also carrying cavalry. In 1175, King Valdemar built Vordingborg Castle as a defensive fortress and as a base from which to launch further raids against the German coast.

In 1180, as unrest spread throughout the rich province of Scania, the people demanded that Valdemar replace the &quot;foreign&quot; governors from Jutland, and instead install nobility from one of the &#x27;Skåneland&#x27; provinces who traditionally ruled them. They also completely refused to pay church tithes. When Valdemar refused their demands, they rose up, saying they would pay neither taxes nor church tithes. Their numbers were so large that Valdemar not only gathered his own levies but also levies from Blekinge. The armies met at the Battle of Dysiaa, where Valdemar crushed them, and after this they once more paid taxes. But even though the entire peasant force surrendered, they still refused to pay tithes, so instead Valdemar had them bring generous gifts and donations to the church. They would pay no tithes but they would pay nonetheless, the only point he conceded were the governors, who were replaced by Scanians. This concession to the Scanians, that a Jute rules in Jutland and Rugian in Rügen, was then optimized for the rest of the Danish realm. This assisted immensely with keeping the peace within the kingdom, and the later extended realm.

==Issue==
Valdemar married Sophia of Minsk (–1198), the daughter of Richeza of Poland, dowager queen of Sweden, from her marriage to Prince Volodar of Minsk. She was the half-sister of King Canute V of Denmark. Valdemar and Sophia had the following children:
*Sophia (1159–1208), married Siegfried III, Count of Weimar-Orlamünde.
*Canute VI of Denmark (1163–1202)
*Maria (born ), became a nun at Roskilde (1188).
*Margaret (), became a nun at Roskilde (1188).
*Valdemar II of Denmark (1170–1241)
*Ingeborg (1174–1237), married King Philip II of France.
*Helena (c.1176 – 1233), married William, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
*Rikissa (c.1178 – 1220), married King Eric X of Sweden.
*Walburgis (d. 1177), married Bogusław I, Duke of Pomerania.

After Valdemar&#x27;s death, Sophia married Landgrave Louis III of Thuringia.

<doc id="184511" wikidata="Q191721" url="?curid=184511" title="Bay of Pigs Invasion">
<text>The Bay of Pigs Invasion (, sometimes called or after the Playa Girón) was a failed military landing operation on the southwestern coast of Cuba in April 1961 by the United States of America and the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front (DRF), consisting of Cuban exiles who opposed Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuban Revolution, clandestinely and directly financed by the U.S. government. The operation took place at the height of the Cold War, and its failure influenced relations between Cuba, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

In 1952, the American-allied dictator General Fulgencio Batista led a coup against President Carlos Prío and forced Prío into exile in Miami, Florida. Prío&#x27;s exile inspired Castro&#x27;s 26th of July Movement against Batista. The movement succeeded in overthrowing Batista during the Cuban Revolution in January 1959. Castro nationalized American businesses, including banks, oil refineries, and sugar and coffee plantations. 
By early 1960, President Eisenhower had begun contemplating ways to remove Castro, in the hopes that he might be replaced by a Cuban government-in-exile, though none existed at the time. In accordance with this goal, Eisenhower eventually approved Richard Bissell&#x27;s plan which included training the paramilitary force that would later be used in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Alongside covert operations, the U.S. also began its embargo of the island. This led Castro to reach out to its Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, after which the US severed diplomatic relations.

Cuban exiles who had moved to the U.S. following Castro&#x27;s takeover had formed the counter-revolutionary military unit Brigade 2506, which was the armed wing of the DRF. The CIA funded the brigade, which also included approximately 60 members of the Alabama Air National Guard, and trained the unit in Guatemala.

Over 1,400 paramilitaries, divided into five infantry battalions and one paratrooper battalion, assembled and launched from Guatemala and Nicaragua by boat on 17 April 1961. Two days earlier, eight CIA-supplied B-26 bombers had attacked Cuban airfields and then returned to the U.S. On the night of 17 April, the main invasion force landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs, where it overwhelmed a local revolutionary militia. Initially, José Ramón Fernández led the Cuban Revolutionary Army counter-offensive; later, Castro took personal control. 

As the invasion force lost the strategic initiative, the international community found out about the invasion, and U.S. President John F. Kennedy decided to withhold further air support. The plan, devised during Eisenhower&#x27;s presidency, had required the involvement of U.S. air and naval forces. Without further air support, the invasion was being conducted with fewer forces than the CIA had deemed necessary. The invading force was defeated within three days by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (Spanish: Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias – FAR) and surrendered on 20 April. Most of the surrendered counter-revolutionary troops were publicly interrogated and put into Cuban prisons with further prosecution.

The invasion was a U.S. foreign policy failure. The Cuban government&#x27;s victory solidified Castro&#x27;s role as a national hero and widened the political division between the two formerly allied countries, as well as emboldened other Latin American groups to undermine U.S. influence in the region. As stated in a memoir from Chester Bowles: &quot;The humiliating failure of the invasion shattered the myth of a New Frontier run by a new breed of incisive, fault-free supermen. However costly, it may have been a necessary lesson.&quot; It also pushed Cuba closer to the Soviet Union, setting the stage for the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.

==Background==
===United States interventions in Cuba===

Since 1492, Cuba had been part of the Spanish Empire. In the late 19th century, Cuban nationalist revolutionaries rebelled against Spanish rule, resulting in three liberation wars: the Ten Years&#x27; War (1868–1878), the Little War (1879–1880) and the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898). In 1898, the United States government proclaimed war on the Spanish Empire, resulting in the Spanish–American War. The U.S. subsequently invaded the island and forced the Spanish Army out. A special operations attempt to land a group of at least 375 Cuban soldiers on the island succeeded in the Battle of Tayacoba.

On 20 May 1902, a new independent government proclaimed the foundation of the Republic of Cuba, with U.S. Military Governor Leonard Wood handing over control to President Tomás Estrada Palma, a Cuban-born U.S. citizen. Subsequently, large numbers of U.S. settlers and businessmen arrived in Cuba, and by 1905, 60% of rural properties were owned by non-Cuban-born North American citizens. Between 1906 and 1909, 5,000 U.S. Marines were stationed across the island, and returned in 1912, 1917 and 1921 to intervene in internal affairs, sometimes at the behest of the Cuban government.

===Constitution of 1940===

In 1940, Cuba adopted a new constitution which drew on many of the ideas of the Cuban Revolution of 1933. The &quot;Encyclopedia of U.S.-Latin American Relations&quot; purports that the 1940 constitution was one of the most progressive constitutions in Latin America, because it legally mandated social security, a minimum wage, health insurance, workers compensation, vacation time, the women&#x27;s right to vote, and the right to free expression.

In 1940, the Cuban general and politician Fulgencio Batista was elected under the provisions of the new constitution. After his term ended in 1944, he was not legally allowed to run for a consecutive term, so he stepped down and moved to Florida. Batista returned to Cuba in 1948 to run for a presidential term starting in 1952.

===CIA interventions===
The CIA was founded in 1947 by the National Security Act. The agency was &quot;a product of the Cold War&quot;, having been designed to counter the espionage activities of the Soviet Union&#x27;s own national security agency, the KGB. As the perceived threat of international communism grew larger, the CIA expanded its activities to undertake covert economic, political, and military activities that would advance causes favorable to U.S. interests, often resulting in brutal dictatorships that favored U.S. interests. CIA Director Allen Dulles was responsible for overseeing covert operations across the world, and although widely considered an ineffectual administrator, he was popular among his employees, whom he had protected from the accusations of McCarthyism.

===Cuban Revolution===

In March 1952 Fulgencio Batista seized power on the island, proclaimed himself president, and deposed the discredited president Carlos Prío Socarrás of the Partido Auténtico. Batista canceled the planned presidential elections and described his new system as &quot;disciplined democracy.&quot;

Although Batista gained some popular support, many Cubans saw it as the establishment of a one-man dictatorship. Many opponents of the Batista regime took to armed rebellion in an attempt to oust the government, sparking the Cuban Revolution. One of these groups was the National Revolutionary Movement (&quot;Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario&quot;), a militant organization containing largely middle-class members that had been founded by the Professor of Philosophy Rafael García Bárcena. Another was the Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil, which had been founded by the Federation of University Students President José Antonio Echevarría.

However, the best known of these anti-Batista groups was the &quot;26th of July Movement&quot; (MR-26-7), founded by Fidel Castro. With Castro as the MR-26-7&#x27;s head, the organization was based upon a clandestine cell system, with each cell containing ten members, none of whom knew the whereabouts or activities of the other cells.

Between December 1956 and 1959, Castro led a guerrilla army against the forces of Batista from his base camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Batista&#x27;s repression of revolutionaries had earned him widespread unpopularity, and by 1958 his armies were in retreat. On 31 December 1958, Batista resigned and fled into exile, taking with him an amassed fortune of more than $300 million.

===Provisional government===

After the success of the revolution a popular uproar across Cuba demanded that those figures who had been complicit in the widespread torture and killing of civilians be brought to justice. Although he remained a moderating force and tried to prevent the mass reprisal killings of Batistanos advocated by many Cubans, Castro helped to set up trials of many figures involved in the old regime across the country, resulting in hundreds of executions. Critics, in particular from the U.S. press, argued that many of these did not meet the standards of a fair trial, and condemned Cuba&#x27;s new government as being more interested in vengeance than justice.

Castro retaliated strongly against such accusations, proclaiming that &quot;revolutionary justice is not based on legal precepts, but on moral conviction.&quot; In a show of support for this &quot;revolutionary justice,&quot; he organized the first Havana trial to take place before a mass audience of 17,000 at the Sports Palace stadium. When a group of 19 pilots accused of bombing a village was found not guilty, Castro ordered a retrial, in which they were found guilty and each sentenced to 30 years in prison.

In early January 1959, Fidel Castro appointed various economists such as Felipe Pazos, Rufo López-Fresquet, Ernesto Bentacourt, Faustino Pérez, and Manuel Ray Rivero. By June 1959, these appointed economists would begin to express disillusionment with Castro&#x27;s proposed economic policies. On 16 February 1959, Castro took on the role of Prime Minister. The presidency fell to Castro&#x27;s chosen candidate, the lawyer Manuel Urrutia Lleó, while members of the MR-26-7 took control of most positions in the cabinet.

In early 1959, the Cuban government began agrarian reforms which redistributed the ownership of Cuba&#x27;s land. Expropriated lands would be put into state ownership, and the newly formed Instituto de la Reforma Agraria (INRA) was to oversee the expropriations and be headed by Fidel Castro. In Camagüey Province there was growing opposition to the Cuban government due to the resistance of conservative farmers to the agrarian reforms and distaste for Raúl Castro and Che Guevara&#x27;s promotion of communist ideals in the local government and military. The anti-communist opposition within the Cuban government assumed that Fidel Castro was unaware of growing communist influence because of Fidel Castro&#x27;s frequent public disavowals of communism.

In April 1959, Fidel Castro announced that elections were to be postponed in order to allow for the provisional government to focus on domestic reforms. Castro announced this electoral delay with the slogan: &quot;revolution first, elections later&quot;. These postponed elections would later be outright canceled in May 1960.

On 17 July 1959, Conrado Bécquer, the sugar workers&#x27; leader, demanded Cuban President Urrutia&#x27;s resignation. Castro himself resigned as Prime Minister of Cuba in protest, but later that day appeared on television to deliver a lengthy denouncement of Urrutia, claiming that Urrutia had &quot;complicated&quot; the government, and that his &quot;fevered anti-communism&quot; was having a detrimental effect. Castro&#x27;s sentiments received widespread support as organized crowds surrounded the presidential palace demanding Urrutia&#x27;s resignation, which was duly received. On July 23, Castro resumed his position as premier and appointed loyalist Osvaldo Dorticós as the new president.

===Diplomatic decline===

The U.S. initially recognized Castro&#x27;s government after the Cuban Revolution ousted Batista, but the relationship quickly soured as Castro repeatedly condemned the U.S. in his speeches for its misdeeds in Cuba over the previous 60 years. Many U.S. officials began to view Castro as a threat to national security as he legalized the Communist Party, nationalized property owned by U.S. citizens totaling $1.5 billion, and strengthened ties with the Soviet Union.

In recently declassified documents, the feelings of the CIA toward Fidel Castro have become more clear. The CIA had written a comprehensive study of the background between the United States and Cuba, beginning with Castro&#x27;s regime. This study was top secret and around 400 pages in length. At the very beginning of Castro, the CIA needed to decipher the alleged pro-communist beliefs. They had inside men working to make a clear decision on the belief of the new Cuban official. According to Volume III of the &quot;Official History of the Bay of Pigs&quot;, the top-secret CIA document, two agents were placed in the ranks of the communist party of Cuba (&quot;Partido Socialista Popular&quot;). In 1958, both agents were either captured or snuck their way into the ranks of Fidel Castro&#x27;s forces. They explained the so-called &#x27;anti-American&#x27; sentiment of the regime.

In 1959, Fidel Castro planned on visiting America. The invitation was extended by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. The already tense relations between Cuba and the US become increasingly futile. According to the written document detailing the conflict, the &quot;Official History of the Bay of Pigs&quot;, written by the CIA, America was apprehensive. The CIA was aware that Castro would not plan on appealing to Heads of State, but instead, the masses, as he addressed the workers and farmers of America. The CIA was not impressed with Castro and believed that his officials and people among his ranks were Communists, and therefore the Castro regime was a Communist regime. Despite the optimistic and seemingly friendly view that Castro revealed, American officials were not convinced. They perceived Castro to be a serious threat, one that needed to be addressed.

==Prelude==
===Huber Matos affair===

On 20 October 1959, Cuban army commander and veteran of the Cuban Revolution, Huber Matos, resigned and accused Castro of &quot;burying the revolution&quot;. Fifteen of Matos&#x27; officers resigned with him. Immediately after the resignation, Castro accused Matos of disloyalty and sent Camilo Cienfuegos to arrest Matos and his accompanying officers. Matos and the officers were taken to Havana and imprisoned in La Cabaña. Cuban communists later claimed Matos was helping plan a counter-revolution organized by the American Central Intelligence Agency and other Castro opponents, an operation that became the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

The scandal is noted for its occurrence alongside a greater trend of removals of Castro&#x27;s former collaborators in the revolution. It marked a turning point where Castro was beginning to exert more personal control over the new government in Cuba. Matos&#x27; arresting officer and former collaborator of Castro, Camilo Cienfuegos, would soon die in a mysterious plane crash shortly after the incident.

Shortly after Matos&#x27; arrest, the prime minister and Che Guevara made a speech to members of the INRA that Cuba would continue to turn in a socialist direction. Manuel Artime viewed the arrest of Matos and affirmation of socialism in Cuba as precedent for him to resign. On 7 November 1959 his resignation letter from INRA and the revolutionary army was published on the front page of &quot;Avance&quot; newspaper, one of the last newspapers not controlled by the government. Artime then entered an underground organization run by Jesuits in Cuba to hide fugitives; it is unclear what exactly made Artime immediately turn to hiding and later defect.

While in a Havana safehouse Artime formed the Movement for Revolutionary Recovery with other dissidents. Artime then contacted the American embassy in Havana, and on 14 December 1959, the CIA arranged for him to travel to the US on a Honduran freighter ship. He became closely involved with Gerry Droller (alias &quot;Frank Bender&quot;, alias &quot;Mr. B&quot;) of the CIA in recruiting and organizing Cuban exiles in Miami for future actions against the Cuban government. Artime&#x27;s organization MRR thus grew to become the principal counter-revolutionary movement inside Cuba, with supporting members in Miami, Mexico, Venezuela etc. Involved were Tony Varona, José Miró Cardona, Rafael Quintero, and Aureliano Arango. Infiltration into Cuba, arms drops, etc. were arranged by the CIA.

Artime became the future leader of Brigade 2506 in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. He gained this position from the notoriety he gained after defecting and engaging in a tour of Latin America denouncing the new government in Cuba. This notoriety as a Cuban dissident gave him credit to be picked as the leader for the invasion when it was first conceived by the CIA.

===Beginning of diplomatic tensions===

Recognizing that Castro and his government were becoming increasingly hostile and openly opposed to the United States, Eisenhower directed the CIA to begin preparations for invading Cuba and overthrowing the Castro regime. An early plan to thwart Castro was devised on 11 February 1960 by Tracy Barnes, Jake Esterline, Al Cox, Dave Phillips, and Jim Flannery to sabotage both Cuban and American Sugar mills. They, along with Allen Dulles, director of the CIA at that point in time, decided that that would be a good preliminary course of action given that Castro&#x27;s government was heavily dependent on the sugar industry. If they could sabotage it, that would hurt Castro financially and politically. Unfortunately, President Eisenhower was less than thrilled to attack Cuba&#x27;s economy and sent Dulles back to the drawing board to devise plans involving covert action. If one was made, then it could be sent to special groups for approval and then discussion with the president again to carry on. Two men, however, decided to run full speed ahead with the sugar sabotage and cut back oil supply to Cuba while raising money for their sugar mission as well whilst the group in the office began to devise other plans to take down Castro.
Richard M. Bissell Jr. was charged with overseeing plans for the Bay of Pigs Invasion. He assembled agents to aid him in the plot, many of whom had worked on the 1954 Guatemalan coup six years before; these included David Philips, Gerry Droller and E. Howard Hunt.

Bissell placed Droller in charge of liaising with anti-Castro segments of the Cuban American community living in the United States, and asked Hunt to fashion a government in exile, which the CIA would effectively control. Hunt proceeded to travel to Havana, where he spoke with Cubans from various backgrounds and discovered a brothel through the Mercedes-Benz agency. Returning to the U.S., he informed the Cuban Americans with whom he was liaising that they would have to move their base of operations from Florida to Mexico City, because the State Department refused to permit the training of a militia on U.S. soil. Although unhappy with the news, they conceded to the order.

On 17 March 1960, the CIA put forward their plan for the overthrow of Castro&#x27;s administration to the U.S. National Security Council, where Eisenhower lent his support, approving a CIA budget of $13,000,000 to explore options to remove Castro from power. The first stated objective of the plan was to &quot;bring about the replacement of the Castro regime with one more devoted to the true interests of the Cuban people and more acceptable to the U.S. in such a manner to avoid any appearance of U.S. intervention.&quot; Four major forms of action were to be taken to aid anti-communist opposition in Cuba at the time. These included providing a powerful propaganda offensive against the regime, perfecting a covert intelligence network within Cuba, developing paramilitary forces outside of Cuba, and acquiring the necessary logistical support for covert military operations on the island. At this stage, however, it was still not clear that an invasion would take place. Documents obtained from the Eisenhower Library revealed that Eisenhower had not ordered or approved plans for an amphibious assault on Cuba.

In 1960, Castro&#x27;s Cuban government ordered the country&#x27;s oil refineries – then controlled by U.S. corporations Esso, Standard Oil, and Shell – to process crude oil purchased from the Soviet Union, but under pressure from the U.S. government, these companies refused. Castro responded by expropriating the refineries and nationalizing them under state control. In retaliation, the U.S. canceled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets, including banks and sugar mills. Relations between Cuba and the U.S. were further strained following the explosion and sinking of a French vessel, the &quot;La Coubre&quot;, in Havana Harbor in March 1960. The cause of the explosion was never determined, but Castro publicly mentioned that the U.S. government was guilty of sabotage.

===Political opposition in Cuba===
In the immediate aftermath of the Cuban Revolution, the rebels appointed José Miró Cardona as prime minister of Cuba. After two months in office, Cardona resigned as Prime Minister, and a year later fled to Miami. While in Miami, Cardona frequently wrote how the Cuban Revolution was a necessary progressive step politically and economically, but that Castro was betraying the democratic goals of the revolution. Cardona later became heavily involved with the Revolutionary Council that coordinated the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Castro&#x27;s government engaged in various crackdowns on internal opposition, arresting hundreds of dissidents. Though it rejected the physical torture Batista&#x27;s regime had used, Castro&#x27;s government sanctioned psychological torture, subjecting some prisoners to solitary confinement, rough treatment, hunger, and threatening behavior. After conservative editors and journalists began expressing hostility towards the government following its leftward turn, the pro-Castro printers&#x27; trade union began to harass and disrupt editorial staff actions. In January 1960, the government proclaimed that each newspaper was obliged to publish a &quot;clarification&quot; by the printers&#x27; union at the end of every article that criticized the government. These &quot;clarifications&quot; signaled the start of press censorship in Castro&#x27;s Cuba.

On May Day, 1960, Fidel Castro would outright condemn elections as corrupt, and cancel all future elections. Castro claimed the revolution had created an informal direct democracy, in which the people and the government had a close bond. In contrast, critics condemned the new regime as un-democratic. The U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter announced that Cuba was adopting the Soviet model of communist rule, with a one-party state, government control of trade unions, suppression of civil liberties and the absence of freedom of speech and press.

In the summer of 1960, major fidelistas were breaking with Castro, and forming dissident groups. Former government ministers Manuel Ray, and Rufo Lopez-Fresquet, as well as labor leader David Salvador, formed the &quot;Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo&quot;, advocating for a &quot;Fidelismo without Fidel&quot;, meaning that Castro&#x27;s social reforms should continue, but not Castro&#x27;s personal consolidation of power.

In June 1960, the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front announced its existence in Mexico City. It hoped to serve as an umbrella organization for various Cuban opposition groups. The included groups were the Constitutional Democratic Rescue Organization, the Movement for Revolutionary Recovery, the Montecristi Organization, the Christian Democrat Movement, the Triple A Organization, and the Anti-Communist Associations Bloc. The super-group criticized Castro&#x27;s removal of civil liberties, and demanded the restoration of the constitution of 1940. Most of the participating opposition groups had already been active in the earlier opposition to Batista.

===Growing diplomatic tensions===
The U.S. government was becoming increasingly critical of Castro&#x27;s revolutionary government. At an August 1960 meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) held in Costa Rica, U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter publicly proclaimed that Castro&#x27;s administration was &quot;following faithfully the Bolshevik pattern&quot; by instituting a single-party political system, taking governmental control of trade unions, suppressing civil liberties, and removing both the freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He furthermore asserted that international communism was using Cuba as an &quot;operational base&quot; for spreading revolution in the western hemisphere, and called on other OAS members to condemn the Cuban government for its breach of human rights. In turn, Castro lambasted the treatment of black people and the working classes he had witnessed in New York City, which he ridiculed as that &quot;superfree, superdemocratic, superhumane, and supercivilized city.&quot; Proclaiming that the U.S. poor were living &quot;in the bowels of the imperialist monster,&quot; he attacked the mainstream U.S. media and accused it of being controlled by big business. Superficially the U.S. was trying to improve its relationship with Cuba. Several negotiations between representatives from Cuba and the U.S. took place around this time. Repairing international financial relations was the focal point of these discussions. Political relations were another hot topic of these conferences. The U.S. stated that they would not interfere with Cuba&#x27;s domestic affairs but that the island should limit its ties with the Soviet Union.

Tensions percolated when the CIA began to act on its desires to snuff out Castro. Efforts to assassinate Castro officially commenced in 1960, though the U.S. public did not become aware of them until 1975, when the Senate Church Committee, set up to investigate CIA abuses, released a report entitled &quot;Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders&quot;. Some methods that the CIA undertook to assassinate Castro were creative, for example: &quot;poison pills, an exploding seashell, and a planned gift of a diving suit contaminated with toxins.&quot; More traditional ways of assassinating Castro were also planned, such as elimination via high-powered rifles with telescopic sights.

In August 1960, the CIA contacted the Cosa Nostra in Chicago with the intention to draft simultaneous assassinations of Fidel Castro, Raúl Castro and Che Guevara. In exchange, if the operation were a success and a pro-U.S. government were restored in Cuba, the CIA agreed that the Mafia would get their &quot;monopoly on gaming, prostitution and drugs&quot;. In 1963, at the same time the Kennedy administration initiated secret peace overtures to Castro, Cuban revolutionary and undercover CIA agent Rolando Cubela was tasked with killing Castro by CIA official Desmond Fitzgerald, who portrayed himself as a personal representative of Robert F. Kennedy.

On 13 October 1960, the U.S. government prohibited the majority of exports to Cuba – the exceptions being medicines and certain foodstuffs – marking the start of an economic embargo. In retaliation, the Cuban National Institute for Agrarian Reform took control of 383 private-run businesses on 14 October, and on 25 October a further 166 U.S. companies operating in Cuba had their premises seized and nationalized, including Coca-Cola and Sears Roebuck. On 16 December, the U.S. ended its import quota of Cuban sugar.

By 31 October 1960, most guerrilla infiltrations and supply drops directed by the CIA into Cuba had failed, and developments of further guerrilla strategies were replaced by plans to mount an initial amphibious assault, with a minimum of 1,500 men. The election of John Kennedy as U.S. president sped up preparations for the invasion; Kennedy had specifically denied any support for Batista supporters: &quot;Batista murdered 20,000 Cubans in seven yearsa greater proportion of the Cuban population than the proportion of Americans who died in both World Wars, and he turned Democratic Cuba into a complete police statedestroying every individual liberty.&quot;

=== 1960 presidential election ===

Cuba became a focal point in the 1960 U.S. presidential election, with both candidates promising to &quot;get tough with the Communists&quot;. Kennedy in particular attacked Nixon and the Eisenhower administration for allowing communism to flourish so close to the U.S. In response, Nixon revealed plans for an embargo against Cuba, but the Democrats criticized it as ineffective. Both main candidates, Richard Nixon of the Republican Party and Kennedy of the Democratic Party, campaigned on the issue of Cuba, with both candidates taking a hardline stance on Castro.

Nixon – who was vice president – insisted that Kennedy should not be informed of the military plans, to which Dulles conceded. To Nixon&#x27;s chagrin, the Kennedy campaign released a scathing statement on the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s Cuba policy on 20 October 1960 which said that &quot;we must attempt to strengthen the non-Batista democratic anti-Castro forces [...] who offer eventual hope of overthrowing Castro&quot;, claiming that &quot;Thus far these fighters for freedom have had virtually no support from our Government.&quot; At the last election debate the next day, Nixon called Kennedy&#x27;s proposed course of action &quot;dangerously irresponsible&quot; and even lectured Kennedy on international law, in effect denigrating the policy that Nixon himself favored.

Ultimately, Nixon lost the election, convinced that Cuba had brought him down, and Kennedy inherited the thorny issue near the height of its prominence.

Despite the focus on Cuba in the elections and deteriorating relations between Cuba and the U.S.exacerbated when Castro accused most of the U.S. State Department personnel in Havana of being spies and subsequently ordering them to leave the country, to which Eisenhower responded by withdrawing recognition of Castro&#x27;s government

===Briefing of Kennedy===

On 18 November 1960, Dulles and Bissell first briefed President-elect Kennedy on the outline plans. Having experience in actions such as the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état, Dulles was confident that the CIA was capable of overthrowing the Cuban government. On 29 November 1960, Eisenhower met with the chiefs of the CIA, Defense, State, and Treasury departments to discuss the new concept. None expressed any objections, and Eisenhower approved the plans with the intention of persuading Kennedy of their merit. On 8 December 1960, Bissell presented outline plans to the &quot;Special Group&quot; while declining to commit details to written records. Further development of the plans continued, and on 4 January 1961 they consisted of an intention to establish a &quot;lodgement&quot; by 750 men at an undisclosed site in Cuba, supported by considerable air power.

Eisenhower had meetings with President-elect Kennedy at the White House on 6 December 1960 and 19 January 1961. In one conversation, Eisenhower stated that since March 1960, the U.S. government had trained &quot;in small unitsbut we had done nothing else[...] some hundreds of refugees&quot; in Guatemala, &quot;a few in Panama, and some in Florida.&quot; However, Eisenhower also expressed disapproval of the idea of Batista returning to power and was waiting for the exiles to agree on a leader who was opposed to both Castro and Batista.

As Eisenhower&#x27;s tenure in office expired, John F. Kennedy replaced him as president of the United States. Having come to power and being adequately informed about the plans to invade Cuba, President Kennedy did not take any action until mid-March 1961. Kennedy hesitated to commit to the CIA&#x27;s plans. Under Dulles and Bissell&#x27;s insistence of the increasingly urgent need to do something with the troops being trained in Guatemala, Kennedy eventually agreed, although to avoid the appearance of American involvement, he requested the operation be moved from the city of Trinidad, Cuba to a less conspicuous location. Thus, the final plan was for an invasion at the Bay of Pigs.

Kennedy&#x27;s immediate actions concerning the invasion could be traced to the 11th and 15th days of March 1961, and were directly connected to the consideration of the best possible invasion strategy. First, it was the TRINIDAD plan that was debated which before Kennedy was commonly agreed as the main plan to be deployed during the Cuban invasion. The TRINIDAD plan aimed to use ships and boats to land troops on the coast of Cuba. This was to be done in conjunction with the deployment of soldiers from airplanes and helicopters to a means to quickly secure areas inside Cuba. The support from the sea and air was planned to start simultaneously with the military landing deployment, and not before them.

In addition, the TRINIDAD also considered a preemptive attack on Castro&#x27;s airfields in the days leading up to the main operation which was termed the Pre-Day strikes. This was aimed to weaken Cuba&#x27;s aerial defense capabilities before the actual invasion was to be carried out. Among other things, the TRINIDAD plan was to utilize six US pilots. This was such that with each pilot flying a B-26, was to hit one or more of the fields where Castro&#x27;s combat aircraft were stationed. However, with Kennedy assuming power, and as discussions continued, the TRINIDAD plan became less strategic, and was to be replaced with a more strategic plan named the ZAPATA.

This was not just a simple tweak but a shift towards a more specific target area within Cuba. It aimed to focus on executing a combined sea and air landing operation in the ZAPATA region. The ZAPATA plan anticipated the immediate use of B-26 aircraft, which were to be brought in and operated from a temporary airstrip at Playa Girón as soon as the troops landed. President Kennedy called to settle on the ZAPATA plan was based on the advice of Mr. Rusk who was a CIA planner. Kennedy and the CIA viewed ZAPATA as a more immediate air support that would ensure the protection of the invaders from Castro&#x27;s counterattacks. And more importantly, as cover to maintain the secrecy of the U.S. involvement to the outside world.

==Preparation==
===Kennedy&#x27;s approval===

On 28 January 1961, Kennedy was briefed, together with all the major departments, on the latest plan (code-named &quot;Operation Pluto&quot;), which involved 1,000 men landed in a ship-borne invasion at Trinidad, Cuba, about 270 km (170 mi) south-east of Havana, at the foothills of the Escambray Mountains in Sancti Spiritus province. Kennedy authorized the active departments to continue and to report progress. Trinidad had good port facilities, it was closer to many existing counter-revolutionary activities, and it offered an escape route into the Escambray Mountains. That scheme was subsequently rejected by the State Department because the airfield there was not large enough for B-26 bombers and, since B-26s were to play a prominent role in the invasion, this would destroy the façade that the invasion was just an uprising with no American involvement. Secretary of State Dean Rusk raised some eyebrows by contemplating airdropping a bulldozer to extend the airfield. Kennedy rejected Trinidad, preferring a more low-key locale. On 4 April 1961, Kennedy approved the Bay of Pigs plan (also known as &quot;Operation Zapata&quot;), because it had a sufficiently long airfield, it was farther away from large groups of civilians than the Trinidad plan, and it was less &quot;noisy&quot; militarily, which would make denial of direct U.S. involvement more plausible. The invasion landing area was changed to beaches bordering the Bahía de Cochinos (Bay of Pigs) in Las Villas Province, 150 km southeast of Havana, and east of the Zapata Peninsula. The landings were to take place at Playa Girón (code-named &quot;Blue Beach&quot;), Playa Larga (code-named &quot;Red Beach&quot;), and Caleta Buena Inlet (code-named &quot;Green Beach&quot;).

Top aides to Kennedy, such as Rusk and both joint chiefs of staff, later said that they had hesitations about the plans but muted their thoughts. Some leaders blamed these problems on the &quot;Cold War mindset&quot; or the determination of the Kennedy brothers to oust Castro and fulfill campaign promises. Military advisers were skeptical of its potential for success as well. Despite these hesitations, Kennedy still ordered the attack to take place.

===Recruitment and training===
Beginning in April 1960, Democratic Revolutionary Front rebels were taken to Useppa Island, Florida, which was covertly leased by the CIA at the time. Useppa Island served as the locale for assessment and training. Once the rebels had arrived, they were greeted by instructors from U.S. Army Special Forces groups, members of the U.S. Air Force and the Alabama Air National Guard, and members of the CIA. The rebels were trained in amphibious assault tactics, guerrilla warfare, infantry and weapons training, unit tactics and land navigation. At the head of the operation was Joaquin Sanjenis Perdomo, former police chief in Cuba, and intelligence officer Rafael De Jesus Gutierrez. The group included David Atlee Philips, Howard Hunt and David Sánchez Morales. The recruiting of Cuban exiles in Miami was organized by CIA staff officers E. Howard Hunt and Gerry Droller. Detailed planning, training and military operations were conducted by Jacob Esterline, Colonel Jack Hawkins, Félix Rodríguez, Rafael De Jesus Gutierrez and Colonel Stanley W. Beerli under the direction of Richard Bissell and his deputy Tracy Barnes.

The force that became Brigade 2506 started with 28 men, who initially were told that their training was being paid for by an anonymous Cuban millionaire émigré, but the recruits soon guessed who was paying the bills, calling their supposed anonymous benefactor &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, and the pretense was dropped. The overall leader was Dr. Manuel Artime while the military leader was José &quot;Pepe&quot; Peréz San Román, a former Cuban National Army officer imprisoned under both Batista and Castro.
For the increasing number of recruits, infantry training was carried out at a CIA-run base code-named &quot;JMTrax&quot;. The base was on the Pacific coast of Guatemala between Quetzaltenango and Retalhuleu, in the Helvetia coffee plantation. The exiled group named themselves Brigade 2506 (&quot;Brigada Asalto 2506&quot;). In summer 1960, an airfield (code-named &quot;JMadd&quot;, aka &quot;Rayo Base&quot;) was constructed near Retalhuleu, Guatemala. Gunnery and flight training of Brigade 2506 aircrews was carried out by personnel from the Alabama Air National Guard under General Reid Doster, using at least six Douglas B-26 Invaders in the markings of the Guatemalan Air Force.

An additional 26 B-26s were obtained from U.S. military stocks, &#x27;sanitized&#x27; at &#x27;Field Three&#x27; to obscure their origins, and about 20 of them were converted for offensive operations by removal of defensive armament, standardization of the &#x27;eight-gun nose&#x27;, and addition of underwing drop tanks and rocket racks. Paratroop training was at a base nicknamed &quot;Garrapatenango&quot;, near Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. Training for boat handling and amphibious landings took place at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico.

Tank training for the Brigade 2506 M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks took place at Fort Knox, Kentucky and Fort Benning, Georgia. Underwater demolition and infiltration training took place at Belle Chasse near New Orleans. To create a navy, the CIA purchased five cargo ships from the Cuban-owned, Miami-based Garcia Line, thereby giving &quot;plausible deniability&quot; as the State Department had insisted no U.S. ships could be involved in the invasion. The first four of the five ships, namely the &quot;Atlántico&quot;, the &quot;Caribe&quot;, the &quot;Houston&quot; and &quot;Río Escondido&quot; were to carry enough supplies and weapons to last thirty days while the &quot;Lake Charles&quot; had 15 days of supplies and was intended to land the provisional government of Cuba. The ships were loaded with supplies at New Orleans and sailed to Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. Additionally, the invasion force had two old Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) ships, the &quot;Blagar&quot; and &quot;Barbara J&quot; from World War II that were part of the CIA&#x27;s &quot;ghost ship&quot; fleet and served as command ships for the invasion. The crews of the supply ships were Cuban while the crews of the LCIs were Americans, borrowed by the CIA from the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS). One CIA officer wrote that MSTS sailors were all professional and experienced but not trained for combat.

===Acquiring supplies===
From June to September 1960, the most time-consuming task was the acquisition of the aircraft to be used in the invasion. The anti-Castro effort depended on the success of these aircraft. Although models such as the Curtiss C-46 Commando and Douglas C-54 Skymaster were to be used for airdrops and bomb drops as well as for infiltration and exfiltration, they were looking for an aircraft that could perform tactical strikes. The two models that were going to be decided on were the Navy&#x27;s Douglas AD-5 Skyraider or the Air Force&#x27;s light bomber, the Douglas B-26 Invader. The AD-5 was readily available and ready for the Navy to train pilots, and in a meeting among a special group in the office of the Deputy Director of the CIA, the AD-5 was approved and decided upon. After a cost-benefit analysis, word was sent that the AD-5 plan would be abandoned and the B-26 would take its place.

In November 1960, the Retalhuleu recruits took part in quelling an officers&#x27; rebellion in Guatemala, in addition to the intervention of the U.S. Navy. The CIA transported people, supplies, and arms from Florida to all the bases at night, using Douglas C-54 transports.

On 9 April 1961, Brigade 2506 personnel, ships, and aircraft started transferring from Guatemala to Puerto Cabezas. Curtiss C-46s were also used for transport between Retalhuleu and a CIA base (code-named &quot;JMTide&quot;, aka &quot;Happy Valley&quot;) at Puerto Cabezas.

Facilities and limited logistical assistance were provided by the governments of General Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes in Guatemala, and General Luis Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua, but no military personnel or equipment of those nations was directly employed in the conflict. Both governments later received military training and equipment, including some of the CIA&#x27;s remaining B-26s.

In early 1961, Cuba&#x27;s army possessed Soviet-designed T-34-85 medium tanks, IS-2 heavy tanks, SU-100 tank destroyers, 122 mm howitzers, other artillery and small arms plus Italian 105 mm howitzers. The Cuban air force armed inventory included B-26 Invader light bombers, Hawker Sea Fury fighters and Lockheed T-33 jets, all remaining from the &quot;Fuerza Aérea del Ejército de Cuba&quot;, the Cuban air force of the Batista government. Anticipating an invasion, Che Guevara stressed the importance of an armed civilian populace, stating: &quot;all of the Cuban people must become a guerrilla army; each and every Cuban must learn to handle and if necessary use firearms in defense of the nation&quot;.

===Cuban Revolutionary Council===
Three weeks before the invasion, in March 1961, the Cuban Revolutionary Council (, CRC) was a formed, with CIA assistance, to &quot;coordinate and direct&quot; the activities of the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front. José Miró Cardona, former Prime Minister of Cuba, was chairman of the Cuban Revolutionary Council. Miró became the de facto leader-in-waiting of the intended post-invasion Cuban government. The CRC comprised the former Cuban Democratic Revolutionary Front, with the addition of the &quot;Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo&quot;. Manuel Artime was sent to Guatemala to serve as the Revolutionary Council&#x27;s liaison with the invaders in training.

The CRC&#x27;s board of directors were: Antonio de Varona, Justo Carrillo, Carlos Hevia, Antonio Maceo, Manuel Ray, and Manuel Artime. The stated goal of the Cuban Revolutionary Council was to establish a provisional government in Cuba, and reestablish the constitution of 1940.

==Security of Cuba==
===Cuban government personnel===
Already, Fidel Castro was known as, and addressed as, the commander-in-chief of Cuban Armed Forces, with a nominal base at &quot;Point One&quot; in Havana. In early April 1961, his brother Raúl Castro was assigned command of forces in the east, based in Santiago de Cuba. Che Guevara commanded western forces, based in Pinar del Río. Major Juan Almeida Bosque commanded forces in the central provinces, based in Santa Clara. Raúl Curbelo Morales was head of the Cuban Air Force. Sergio del Valle Jiménez was Director of Headquarters Operations at Point One. Efigenio Ameijeiras was the Head of the Revolutionary National Police. Ramiro Valdés Menéndez was Minister of the Interior and head of G-2 (Seguridad del Estado, or state security). His deputy was Comandante Manuel Piñeiro Losada, also known as &#x27;Barba Roja&#x27;. Captain José Ramón Fernández was head of the School of Militia Leaders (Cadets) at Matanzas.

Other commanders of units during the conflict included Major Raúl Menéndez Tomassevich, Major Filiberto Olivera Moya, Major René de los Santos, Major Augusto Martínez Sánchez, Major Félix Duque, Major Pedro Miret, Major Flavio Bravo, Major Antonio Lussón, Captain Orlando Pupo Peña, Captain Victor Dreke, Captain Emilio Aragonés, Captain Ángel Fernández Vila, Arnaldo Ochoa, and Orlando Rodríguez Puerta. Soviet-trained Spanish advisors were brought to Cuba from Eastern Bloc countries. These advisors had held high staff positions in the Soviet armies during World War II and became known as &quot;Hispano-Soviets,&quot; having long resided in the Soviet Union. The most senior of these was the Spanish communist veterans of the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Ciutat de Miguel, Enrique Líster and Cuban-born Alberto Bayo. Ciutat de Miguel (Cuban alias: Ángel Martínez Riosola, commonly referred to as &quot;Angelito&quot;), was an advisor to forces in the central provinces. The role of other Soviet agents at the time is uncertain, but some of them acquired greater fame later. For example, KGB colonels Vadim Kochergin and Victor Simanov were first sighted in Cuba in about September 1959.

===Internal strife===

Militant counter-revolutionary groups developed soon after the revolution in an attempt to overthrow the new regime. Undertaking armed attacks against government forces, some set up guerrilla bases in Cuba&#x27;s mountainous regions, leading to the six-year Escambray Rebellion. These dissidents were funded and armed by various foreign sources, including the exiled Cuban community, the CIA and Rafael Trujillo&#x27;s regime in the Dominican Republic.

Inside Cuba, no quarter was given during the suppression of the resistance in the Escambray Mountains, where former rebels from the war against Batista took different sides. On 3 April 1961, a bomb attack on militia barracks in Bayamo killed four militia and wounded eight more. On 6 April, the Hershey Sugar factory in Matanzas was destroyed by sabotage. On 14 April 1961, guerrillas led by Agapito Rivera fought Cuban government forces in Villa Clara Province, where several government troops were killed and others wounded. Also on 14 April 1961, a Cubana airliner was hijacked and flown to Jacksonville, Florida; resultant confusion then helped the staged &#x27;defection&#x27; of a B-26 military aircraft and pilot at Miami on 15 April.

===Prior warnings of invasion===
The Cuban security apparatus knew the invasion was coming, in part due to indiscreet talk by members of the brigade, some of which was heard in Miami and repeated in U.S. and foreign newspaper reports. Nevertheless, days before the invasion, multiple acts of sabotage were carried out, such as the El Encanto fire, an arson attack in a department store in Havana on 13 April that killed one shop worker. The Cuban government also had been warned by senior KGB agents Osvaldo Sánchez Cabrera and &#x27;Aragon&#x27;, who died violently before and after the invasion, respectively. The general Cuban population was not well informed of intelligence matters, which the US sought to exploit with propaganda through CIA-funded Radio Swan. As of May 1960, almost all means of public communication were under public ownership.

On 29 April 2000, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, &quot;Soviets Knew Date of Cuba Attack&quot;, reported that the CIA had information indicating that the Soviet Union knew the invasion was going to take place and did not inform Kennedy. On 13 April 1961, Radio Moscow broadcast an English-language newscast, predicting the invasion &quot;in a plot hatched by the CIA&quot; using paid &quot;criminals&quot; within a week. The invasion took place four days later.

David Ormsby-Gore, the British ambassador to the U.S., stated that British intelligence analysis made available to the CIA indicated that the Cuban people were overwhelmingly behind Castro and that there was no likelihood of mass defections or insurrections.

==Initiation==
===Fleet sets sail===

Under cover of darkness, the invasion fleet set sail from Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua and headed towards the Bay of Pigs on the night of 14 April. After on-loading the attack planes in Norfolk Naval Base and taking on prodigious quantities of food and supplies sufficient for the seven weeks at-sea to come, the crew knew from the hasty camouflage of the ship and aircraft identifying numbers that a secret mission was on hand. Combatants were supplied with forged Cuban local currency, in the form of 20 Peso bills, identifiable by the serial numbers F69 and F70. The aircraft carrier group of the had been at sea for nearly a month before the invasion; its crew was well aware of the impending battle. En route, &quot;Essex&quot; had made a night time stop at a Navy arms depot in Charleston, South Carolina, to load tactical nuclear weapons to be held ready during the cruise. The afternoon of the invasion, one accompanying destroyer rendezvoused with &quot;Essex&quot; to have a gun mount repaired and put back into action; the ship displayed numerous shell casings on deck from its shore bombardment actions. On 16 April &quot;Essex&quot; was at general quarters for most of a day; Soviet MiG-15s made feints and close range fly overs that night.

===Air attacks on airfields===
During the night of 14/15 April, a diversionary landing was planned near Baracoa, Oriente Province, by about 164 Cuban exiles commanded by Higinio &#x27;Nino&#x27; Diaz. Their mother ship, named &quot;La Playa&quot; or &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, had sailed from Key West under a Costa Rican ensign. Several U.S. Navy destroyers were stationed offshore near Guantánamo Bay to give the appearance of an impending invasion fleet. The reconnaissance boats turned back to the ship after their crews detected activities by Cuban Militia forces along the coastline. As a result of those activities, at daybreak, a reconnaissance sortie over the Baracoa area was launched from Santiago de Cuba by an FAR T-33, piloted by Lt. Orestes Acosta, and it crashed fatally into the sea. On 17 April, his name was falsely quoted as a defector among the disinformation circulating in Miami.

The CIA, with the backing of the Pentagon, had originally requested permission to produce sonic booms over Havana on 14 April to create confusion. The request was a form of psychological warfare that had proven successful in the overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954. The point was to create confusion in Havana and have it be a distraction to Castro if they could &quot;break all the windows in town.&quot; The request was denied, however, since officials thought such would be too obvious a sign of involvement by the United States.

On 15 April 1961, at about 06:00, Cuban local time, eight B-26B Invader bombers in three groups simultaneously attacked three Cuban airfields at San Antonio de los Baños and at Ciudad Libertad (formerly named Campo Columbia), both near Havana, plus the Antonio Maceo International Airport at Santiago de Cuba. The B-26s had been prepared by the CIA on behalf of Brigade 2506 and had been painted with the false flag markings of the FAR. Each came armed with bombs, rockets, and machine guns. They had flown from Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua and were crewed by exiled Cuban pilots and navigators of the self-styled &quot;Fuerza Aérea de Liberación&quot; (FAL). The purpose of the action (code-named &quot;Operation Puma&quot;) was reportedly to destroy most or all of the armed aircraft of the FAR in preparation for the main invasion.

At Santiago, the two attackers destroyed a C-47 transport, a PBY Catalina flying boat, two B-26s and a civilian Douglas DC-3 plus various other civilian aircraft. At San Antonio, the three attackers destroyed three FAR B-26s, one Sea Fury and one T-33, and one attacker diverted to Grand Cayman because of low fuel. Aircraft that diverted to the Caymans were seized by the United Kingdom since they were suspicious that the Cayman Islands might be perceived as a launch site for the invasion. At Ciudad Libertad, the three attackers destroyed only non-operational aircraft such as two Republic P-47 Thunderbolts.

One of those attackers was damaged by anti-aircraft fire and ditched about north of Cuba, with the loss of its crew Daniel Fernández Mon and Gaston Pérez. Its companion B-26, also damaged, continued north and landed at Boca Chica Field, Florida. The crew, José Crespo and Lorenzo Pérez-Lorenzo, were granted political asylum, and made their way back to Nicaragua the next day via Miami and the daily CIA C-54 flight from Opa-Locka Airport to Puerto Cabezas Airport. Their B-26, purposely numbered 933, the same as at least two other B-26s that day for disinformation reasons, was held until late on 17 April.

===Deception flight===
About 90 minutes after the eight B-26s had taken off from Puerto Cabezas to attack Cuban airfields, another B-26 departed on a deception flight that took it close to Cuba but headed north towards Florida. Like the bomber groups, it carried false FAR markings and the same number 933 as painted on at least two of the others. Before departure, the cowling from one of the aircraft&#x27;s two engines was removed by CIA personnel, fired upon, then re-installed to give the false appearance that the aircraft had taken ground fire at some point during its flight. At a safe distance north of Cuba, the pilot feathered the engine with the pre-installed bullet holes in the cowling, radioed a mayday call, and requested immediate permission to land at Miami International airport. He landed and taxied to the military area of the airport near an Air Force C-47 and was met by several government cars. The pilot was Mario Zúñiga, formerly of the FAEC (Cuban Air Force under Batista), and after landing, he masqueraded as &#x27;Juan Garcia&#x27; and publicly claimed that three colleagues had also defected from the FAR. The next day he was granted political asylum, and that night he returned to Puerto Cabezas via Opa-Locka. This deception operation was successful at the time in convincing much of the world media that the attacks on the FAR bases were the work of an internal anti-Communist faction and did not involve outside actors.

===Reactions===
At 10:30 on 15 April at the United Nations (UN), Cuban Foreign Minister Raúl Roa accused the U.S. of aggressive air attacks against Cuba and that afternoon formally tabled a motion to the Political (First) Committee of the UN General Assembly. Only days earlier, the CIA had unsuccessfully attempted to entice Raúl Roa into defecting. In response to Roa&#x27;s accusations before the UN, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson stated that U.S. armed forces would not &quot;under any conditions&quot; intervene in Cuba and that the U.S. would do everything in its power to ensure that no U.S. citizens would participate in actions against Cuba. He also stated that Cuban defectors had carried out the attacks that day, and he presented a UPI wire photo of Zúñiga&#x27;s B-26 in Cuban markings at Miami airport. Stevenson was later embarrassed to realize that the CIA had lied to him.

Kennedy supported the statement made by Stevenson: &quot;I have emphasized before that this was a struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator. While we could not be expected to hide our sympathies, we made it repeatedly clear that the armed forces of this country would not intervene in any way&quot;.

On 15 April, the Cuban national police, led by Efigenio Ameijeiras, started the process of arresting thousands of suspected anti-revolutionary individuals and detaining them in provisional locations such as the Karl Marx Theatre, the moat of La Cabaña and the Principe Castle, all in Havana, and the baseball park in Matanzas. In total, between 20,000 and 100,000 people would be arrested.

===Operation Mars===
The &quot;Special Battalion&quot; of Brigade 2506, consisting of 160 guerrilla warfighters under the command of Higinio Nino Diaz Ane, was tasked with carrying out &quot;Operation Mars.&quot; Operation Mars was a separate mission from Operation Pluto and unknown to JFK that was organized by the former Vice President Richard Nixon and CIA Director George Bush alongside their Cuban exile counterparts. The intention of Mars was to land at the beach (playa) near Baracoa to provide a Feint attack for the primary landing force at Giron. Men of the Special Battalion trained separately from the men of Operation Pluto, at Camp Beauregard.

On the night of 15/16 April, the Nino Diaz group failed in a second attempted diversionary landing at a different location near Baracoa. On 16 April, Merardo Leon, Jose Leon, and 14 others staged an armed uprising at Las Delicias Estate in Las Villas, with only four surviving.

Following the airstrikes on the Cuban airfields on 15 April, the FAR prepared for action with its surviving aircraft which numbered at least four T-33 jet trainers, four Sea Fury fighters and five or six B-26 medium bombers. The T-33s and B-26s were armed with machine guns and the Sea Furies with 20 mm cannon for air-to-air combat and strafing ships and ground targets. CIA planners had failed to discover that the U.S.-supplied T-33 trainer jets had long been armed with M3 machine guns. The three types could also carry bombs and rocket pods for attacks against ships and tanks.

No additional airstrikes against Cuban airfields and aircraft were specifically planned before 17 April, because B-26 pilots&#x27; exaggerated claims gave the CIA false confidence in the success of 15 April attacks, until U-2 reconnaissance photos taken on 16 April showed otherwise. Late on 16 April, President Kennedy ordered the cancellation of further airfield strikes planned for dawn on 17 April, to attempt plausible deniability of direct U.S. involvement.

Late on 16 April, the CIA/Brigade 2506 invasion fleet converged on &#x27;Rendezvous Point Zulu&#x27;, about south of Cuba, having sailed from Puerto Cabezas in Nicaragua where they had been loaded with troops and other materiel, after loading arms and supplies at New Orleans. The U.S. Navy operation was code-named &quot;Bumpy Road&quot;, having been changed from &quot;Crosspatch&quot;. The fleet, labeled the &#x27;Cuban Expeditionary Force&#x27; (CEF), included five 2,400-ton (empty weight) freighter ships chartered by the CIA from the Garcia Line, and subsequently outfitted with anti-aircraft guns. Four of the freighters, &quot;Houston&quot; (code name &quot;Aguja&quot;), &quot;Río Escondido&quot; (code name &quot;Ballena&quot;), &quot;Caribe&quot; (code name &quot;Sardina&quot;), and &quot;Atlántico&quot; (code-name &quot;Tiburón&quot;), were planned to transport about 1,400 troops in seven battalions and armaments near to the invasion beaches. The fifth freighter, &quot;Lake Charles&quot;, was loaded with follow-up supplies and some Operation 40 infiltration personnel.

The freighters sailed under Liberian ensigns. Accompanying them were two LCIs outfitted with heavy armament at Key West. The LCIs were &quot;Blagar&quot; (code-name &quot;Marsopa&quot;) and &quot;Barbara J&quot; (code-name &quot;Barracuda&quot;), sailing under Nicaraguan ensigns. After exercises and training at Vieques Island, the CEF ships were individually escorted (outside visual range) to &quot;Point Zulu&quot; by U.S. Navy destroyers , , , , , , and . US Navy Task Group 81.8 had already assembled off the Cayman Islands, commanded by Rear Admiral John E. Clark onboard aircraft carrier USS &quot;Essex&quot;, plus helicopter assault carrier , destroyers , , , , and submarines and .

Command and control ship and carrier were also reportedly active in the Caribbean at the time. was a Landing Ship Dock that carried three Landing Craft Utility (LCUs) which could accommodate the Brigade&#x27;s M41 tanks and four Landing Craft, Vehicles, Personnel (LCVPs). &quot;San Marcos&quot; had sailed from Vieques Island. At &quot;Point Zulu&quot;, the seven CEF ships sailed north without the USN escorts, except for &quot;San Marcos&quot; that continued until the seven landing craft were unloaded when just outside the Cuban territorial limit.

==Invasion==

===Invasion day 17 April===

During the night of 16/17 April, a mock diversionary landing was organized by CIA operatives near Bahía Honda, Pinar del Río Province. A flotilla containing equipment that broadcast sounds and other effects of a shipborne invasion landing provided the source of Cuban reports that briefly lured Fidel Castro away from the Bay of Pigs battlefront area.

At midnight on 17 April 1961, the two LCIs &quot;Blagar&quot; and &quot;Barbara J&quot;, each with a CIA &#x27;operations officer&#x27; and an Underwater Demolition Team of five frogmen, entered the Bay of Pigs. They headed a force of four transport ships (&quot;Houston&quot;, &quot;Río Escondido&quot;, &quot;Caribe&quot; and &quot;Atlántico&quot;) carrying about 1,400 Cuban exile ground troops of Brigade 2506, plus the brigade&#x27;s M41 tanks and other vehicles in the landing craft. At about 01:00, &quot;Blagar&quot;, as the battlefield command ship, directed the principal landing at Playa Girón (code-named &quot;Blue Beach&quot;), led by the frogmen in rubber boats followed by troops from &quot;Caribe&quot; in small aluminum boats, then the LCVPs and LCUs with the M41 tanks. &quot;Barbara J&quot;, leading &quot;Houston&quot;, similarly landed troops 35 km further northwest at Playa Larga (code-named &quot;Red Beach&quot;), using small fiberglass boats.

The unloading of troops at night was delayed because of engine failures and boats damaged by unseen coral reefs; the CIA had originally believed that the coral reef was seaweed. As the frogmen came in, they were shocked to discover that Red Beach was lit with floodlights, which led to the location of the landing being hastily changed. As the frogmen landed, a firefight broke out when a Jeep carrying Cuban Militia happened by. The few militias in the area succeeded in warning Cuban Armed Forces via radio soon after the first landing, before the invaders overcame their token resistance. Castro was awakened at about 03:15 to be informed of the landings, which led him to put all militia units in the area on the highest state of alert and to order airstrikes. The Cuban regime planned to strike the &quot;brigadistas&quot; at Playa Larga first as they were inland before turning on the &quot;brigadistas&quot; at Girón at sea. Castro departed personally to lead his forces into battle against the &quot;brigadistas&quot;.

At daybreak around 06:30, three FAR Sea Furies, one B-26 bomber and two T-33s started attacking those CEF ships still unloading troops. At about 06:50, south of Playa Larga, &quot;Houston&quot; was damaged by several bombs and rockets from a Sea Fury and a T-33, and about two hours later Captain Luis Morse intentionally beached it on the western side of the bay. About 270 troops had been unloaded, but about 180 survivors who struggled ashore were incapable of taking part in further action because of the loss of most of their weapons and equipment. The loss of &quot;Houston&quot; was a great blow to the &quot;brigadistas&quot; as that ship was carrying much of the medical supplies, which meant that wounded &quot;brigadistas&quot; had to make do with inadequate medical care. At about 07:00, two FAL B-26s attacked and sank the Cuban Navy patrol escort ship &quot;El Baire&quot; at Nueva Gerona on the Isle of Pines. They then proceeded to Girón to join two other B-26s to attack Cuban ground troops and provide distraction air cover for the paratroop C-46s and the CEF ships under air attack. The M41 tanks had all landed by 07:30 at Blue Beach and all of the troops by 08:30. Neither San Román at Blue Beach nor Erneido Oliva at Red Beach could communicate as all of the radios had been soaked in the water during the landings.

At about 07:30, five C-46 and one C-54 transport aircraft dropped 177 paratroops from the parachute battalion in an action code-named &quot;Operation Falcon&quot;. About 30 men, plus heavy equipment, were dropped south of the Central Australia sugar mill on the road to Palpite and Playa Larga, but the equipment was lost in the swamps, and the troops failed to block the road. Other troops were dropped at San Blas, at Jocuma between Covadonga and San Blas, and at Horquitas between Yaguaramas and San Blas. Those positions to block the roads were maintained for two days, reinforced by ground troops from Playa Girón and tanks. The paratroopers had landed amid a collection of militia, but their training allowed them to hold their own against the ill-trained militiamen. However, the dispersal of the paratroopers as they landed meant they were unable to take the road from the sugar mill down to Playa Larga, which allowed the government to continue to send troops down to resist the invasion.

At about 08:30, a FAR Sea Fury piloted by Carlos Ulloa Arauz crashed in the bay after encountering a FAL C-46 returning south after dropping paratroops. By 09:00, Cuban troops and militia from outside the area had started arriving at the sugar mill, Covadonga and Yaguaramas. Throughout the day they were reinforced by more troops, heavy armour and T-34-85 tanks typically carried on flat-bed trucks. At about 09:30, FAR Sea Furies and T-33s fired rockets at &quot;Río Escondido&quot;, which then sank about south of Girón. &quot;Río Escondido&quot; was loaded with aviation fuel, and as the ship started to burn, the captain gave the order to abandon ship with the ship being destroyed in three explosions shortly afterward. &quot;Río Escondido&quot; carried fuel along with enough ammunition, food, and medical supplies to last ten days and the radio that allowed the brigade to communicate with the FAL. The loss of the &quot;Río Escondido&quot; meant that San Román was only able to issue orders to the forces at Blue Beach, and he had no idea of what was happening at Red Beach or with the paratroopers. A messenger from Red Beach arrived at about 10:00 asking San Román to send tank and infantry to block the road from the sugar mill, a request that he agreed to. It was not expected that government forces would be counter-attacking from this direction.
At about 11:00, Castro issued a statement over Cuba&#x27;s nationwide network saying that the invaders, members of the exiled Cuban revolutionary front, have come to destroy the revolution and take away the dignity and rights of men. At about 11:00, a FAR T-33 attacked and shot down a FAL B-26 (serial number 935) piloted by Matias Farias, who then survived a crash landing on the Girón Airfield, his navigator Eduardo González already killed by gunfire. His companion B-26 suffered damage and diverted to Grand Cayman Island. By about 11:00, the two remaining freighters &quot;Caribe&quot; and &quot;Atlántico&quot;, and the LCIs and LCUs, started retreating south to international waters, but were still pursued by FAR aircraft. At about noon, a FAR B-26 exploded from heavy anti-aircraft fire from &quot;Blagar&quot;, and pilot Luis Silva Tablada (on his second sortie) and his crew of three were lost.

By noon, hundreds of Cuban militia cadets from Matanzas had secured Palpite and cautiously advanced on foot south towards Playa Larga, suffering many casualties during attacks by FAL B-26s. By dusk, other Cuban ground forces gradually advanced southward from Covadonga, southwest from Yaguaramas toward San Blas, and westward along coastal tracks from Cienfuegos towards Girón all without heavy weapons or armour. At 14:30 a group of militiamen from the 339th Battalion set up a position, which came under attack from the &quot;brigadista&quot; M41 tanks, which inflicted heavy losses on the defenders. This action is remembered in Cuba as the &quot;Slaughter of the Lost Battalion&quot; as most of the militiamen perished.

Three FAL B-26s were shot down by FAR T-33s, with the loss of pilots Raúl Vianello, José Crespo, Osvaldo Piedra and navigators Lorenzo Pérez-Lorenzo and José Fernández. Vianello&#x27;s navigator Demetrio Pérez bailed out and was picked up by USS &quot;Murray&quot;. Pilot Crispín García Fernández and navigator Juan González Romero, in B-26 serial 940, diverted to Boca Chica, but late that night they attempted to fly back to Puerto Cabezas in B-26 serial 933 that Crespo had flown to Boca Chica on 15 April. In October 1961, the remains of the B-26 and its two crew were found in the dense jungle in Nicaragua. One FAL B-26 diverted to Grand Cayman with engine failure. By 04:00, Castro had arrived at the Central Australia sugar mill, joining José Ramón Fernández whom he had appointed as battlefield commander before dawn that day.

At about 05:00, a night air strike by three FAL B-26s on San Antonio de Los Baños airfield failed, reportedly because of incompetence and bad weather. Two other B-26s had aborted the mission after take-off. Other sources allege that heavy anti-aircraft fire scared the aircrews. As night fell, &quot;Atlántico&quot; and &quot;Caribe&quot; pulled away from Cuba to be followed by &quot;Blagar&quot; and &quot;Barbara J&quot;. The ships were to return to the Bay of Pigs the following day to unload more ammunition, however the captains of the &quot;Atlántico&quot; and &quot;Caribe&quot; decided to abandon the invasion and head out to open sea fearing further air attacks by the FAR. Destroyers from the U.S. Navy intercepted &quot;Atlántico&quot; about south of Cuba and persuaded the captain to return, but &quot;Caribe&quot; was not intercepted until she was away from Cuba, and she was not to return until it was too late.

===Invasion day plus one (D+1) 18 April===

During the night of 17–18 April, the force at Red Beach came under repeated counter-attacks from the Cuban Army and militia. As casualties mounted and ammunition was used up, the &quot;brigadistas&quot; steadily gave way. Airdrops from four C-54s and 2 C-46s had only limited success in landing more ammunition. Both the &quot;Blagar&quot; and &quot;Barbara J&quot; returned at midnight to land more ammunition, which proved insufficient for the &quot;brigadistas&quot;. Following desperate appeals for help from Oliva, San Román ordered all of his M41 tanks to assist in the defense. During the night fighting, a tank battle broke out when the &quot;brigadista&quot; M41 tanks clashed with the T-34-85 tanks of the Cuban Army. This sharp action forced back the &quot;brigadistas.&quot;

At 22:00, the Cuban Army opened fire with its 76.2 mm and 122 mm artillery guns on the &quot;brigadista&quot; forces at Playa Larga, which was followed by an attack by T-34 tanks at about midnight. The 2,000 artillery rounds fired by the Cuban Army had mostly missed the &quot;brigadista&quot; defense positions, and the T-34-85 tanks rode into an ambush when they came under fire from the &quot;brigadista&quot; M41 tanks and mortar fire, and a number of T-34-85 tanks were destroyed or knocked out. At 01:00, Cuban Army infantrymen and militiamen started an offensive. Despite heavy losses on the part of the Cuban forces, the shortage of ammunition forced the &quot;brigadistas&quot; back and the T-34-85 tanks continued to force their way past the wreckage of the battlefield to press on the assault. The Cuban forces in the assault numbered about 2,100 men, consisting of about 300 FAR soldiers, 1,600 militiamen and 200 local policemen supported by at least 20 T-34-85 tanks who were faced by 370 &quot;brigadistas&quot;.

By 05:00, Oliva started to order his men to retreat as he had almost no ammunition or mortar rounds left. By about 10:30, Cuban troops and militia, supported by the T-34-85 tanks and 122 mm artillery, took Playa Larga after Brigade forces had fled towards Girón in the early hours. During the day, Brigade forces retreated to San Blas along the two roads from Covadonga and Yaguaramas. By then, both Castro and Fernández had relocated to that battlefront area.

As the men from Red Beach arrived at Girón, San Román and Oliva met to discuss the situation. With ammunition running low, Oliva suggested that the brigade retreat into the Escambray Mountains to wage guerilla warfare, but San Román decided to hold the beachhead. At about 11:00, the Cuban Army began an offensive to take San Blas. San Román ordered all of the paratroopers back in order to hold San Blas, and they halted the offensive. During the afternoon, Castro kept the &quot;brigadistas&quot; under steady air attack and artillery fire but did not order any new major attacks.

At 14:00, Kennedy received a telegram from Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow, stating the Soviets would not allow the U.S. to enter Cuba and implied swift nuclear retribution to the United States heartland if their warnings were not heeded.

At about 17:00, FAL B-26s attacked a Cuban column of 12 private buses leading trucks carrying tanks and other armor, moving southeast between Playa Larga and Punta Perdiz. The vehicles, loaded with civilians, militia, police, and soldiers, were attacked with bombs, napalm, and rockets, suffering heavy casualties. The six attacking FAL B-26s were piloted by two CIA contract pilots plus four pilots and six navigators from the FAL. The column later re-formed and advanced to Punta Perdiz, about 11 km northwest of Girón.

===Invasion day plus two (D+2) 19 April===
During the night of 18 April, a FAL C-46 delivered arms and equipment to the Girón airstrip occupied by brigade ground forces and took off before daybreak on 19 April. The C-46 also evacuated Matias Farias, the pilot of B-26 serial &#x27;935&#x27; (code-named &quot;Chico Two&quot;) that had been shot down and crash-landed at Girón on 17 April. The crews of the &quot;Barbara J&quot; and &quot;Blagar&quot; had done their best to land what ammunition they had left onto the beachhead, but without air support the captains of both ships reported that it was too dangerous to be operating off the Cuban coast by day.

The final air attack mission (code-named &quot;Mad Dog Flight&quot;) comprised five B-26s, four of which were manned by American CIA contract aircrews and volunteer pilots from the Alabama Air National Guard. One FAR Sea Fury (piloted by Douglas Rudd) and two FAR T-33s (piloted by Rafael del Pino and Alvaro Prendes) shot down two of these B-26s, killing four American airmen. Combat air patrols were flown by Douglas A4D-2N Skyhawk jets of VA-34 squadron operating from the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Essex&quot;, with nationality and other markings removed. Sorties were flown to reassure brigade soldiers and pilots and to intimidate Cuban government forces without directly engaging in combat.

At 10:00, a tank battle broke out, with the &quot;brigadista&quot; holding their line until about 14:00, which led Oliva to order a retreat into Girón. After the last air attacks, San Román ordered his paratroopers and the men of the 3rd Battalion to launch a surprise attack, which was initially successful but soon failed. With the &quot;brigadistas&quot; in disorganized retreat, the Cuban Army and militiamen started to advance rapidly, taking San Blas only to be stopped outside of Girón at about 11:00. Later that afternoon, San Román heard the rumbling of the advancing T-34-85s and reported that with no more mortar rounds or bazooka rounds, he could not stop the tanks and ordered his men to fall back to the beach. Oliva arrived afterward to find that the &quot;brigadistas&quot; were all heading out to the beach or retreating into the jungle or swamps. Without direct air support, and short of ammunition, Brigade 2506 ground forces retreated to the beaches in the face of the onslaught from Cuban government artillery, tanks, and infantry.

Late on 19 April, destroyers USS &quot;Eaton&quot; (code-named &quot;Santiago&quot;) and USS &quot;Murray&quot; (code-named &quot;Tampico&quot;) moved into Cochinos Bay to evacuate retreating Brigade soldiers from beaches, before fire from Cuban Army tanks caused Commodore Crutchfield to order a withdrawal.

===Invasion day plus three (D+3) 20 April===

From 19 April until about 22 April, sorties were flown by A4D-2Ns to obtain visual intelligence over combat areas. Reconnaissance flights are also reported of AD-5Ws of VFP-62 and/or VAW-12 squadron from USS &quot;Essex&quot; or another carrier, such as USS &quot;Shangri-La&quot; that was part of the task force assembled off the Cayman Islands.

On 21 April, &quot;Eaton&quot; and &quot;Murray&quot;, joined on 22 April by destroyers USS &quot;Conway&quot; and USS &quot;Cony&quot;, plus submarine USS &quot;Threadfin&quot; and a CIA PBY-5A Catalina flying boat, continued to search the coastline, reefs, and islands for scattered Brigade survivors, about 24–30 being rescued.

==Aftermath==

===Casualties===
Sixty-seven Cuban exiles from Brigade 2506 were killed in action. Additionally, 10 more were executed by firing squad; 10 lost their lives on the boat &quot;Celia&quot; trying to escape; nine were in the sealed truck container on the way to Havana; four died by accident; two in prison; and four American aviators also died, for a total of 106 deaths. Aircrews killed in action totaled 6 from the Cuban air force, 10 Cuban exiles and 4 American airmen. Paratrooper Eugene Herman Koch was killed in action, and the American airmen shot down were Thomas W. Ray, Leo F. Baker, Riley W. Shamburger, and Wade C. Gray. In 1979, the body of Thomas &quot;Pete&quot; Ray was repatriated from Cuba. In the 1990s, the CIA admitted he was linked to the agency and awarded him the Intelligence Star.

The final toll for Cuban armed forces during the conflict was 176 killed in action. This figure includes only the Cuban Army and it is estimated that about 2,000 militiamen were killed or wounded during the fighting. Other Cuban forces casualties were between 500 and 4,000 (killed, wounded or missing). The airfield attacks on 15 April left 7 Cubans dead and 53 wounded.

In 2011, the National Security Archive, under the Freedom of Information Act, released over 1,200 pages of documents. Included within these documents were descriptions of incidents of friendly fire. The CIA had outfitted some B-26 bombers to appear as Cuban aircraft, having ordered them to remain inland to avoid being fired upon by American-backed forces. Some of the planes, not heeding the warning, came under fire. According to CIA operative Grayston Lynch, &quot;we couldn&#x27;t tell them from the Castro planes. We ended up shooting at two or three of them. We hit some of them there because when they came at us... it was a silhouette, that was all you could see.&quot;

===Prisoners===

On 19 April, at least seven Cubans plus two CIA-hired U.S. citizens (Angus K. McNair and Howard F. Anderson) were executed in Pinar del Río province, after a two-day trial. On 20 April, Humberto Sorí Marin was executed at La Cabaña, having been arrested on 18 March following infiltration into Cuba with 14 tons of explosives. His fellow conspirators Rogelio González Corzo (alias &quot;Francisco Gutierrez&quot;), Rafael Diaz Hanscom, Eufemio Fernandez, Arturo Hernandez Tellaheche and Manuel Lorenzo Puig Miyar were also executed.

Between April and October 1961, hundreds of executions took place in response to the invasion. They took place at various prisons, including the Fortaleza de la Cabaña and Morro Castle. Infiltration team leaders Antonio Diaz Pou and Raimundo E. Lopez, as well as underground students Virgilio Campaneria, Alberto Tapia Ruano, and more than one hundred other insurgents were executed.

About 1,202 members of Brigade 2506 were captured, of whom nine died from asphyxiation during their transfer to Havana in an airtight truck container. In May 1961, Castro proposed to exchange the surviving brigade prisoners for 500 large farm tractors, later changed to US$28,000,000. On 8 September 1961, 14 Brigade prisoners were convicted of torture, murder and other major crimes committed in Cuba before the invasion. Five were executed and nine others imprisoned for 30 years.

Three confirmed as executed were Ramon Calvino, Emilio Soler Puig (&quot;El Muerte&quot;) and Jorge King Yun (&quot;El Chino&quot;). On 29 March 1962, 1,179 men were put on trial for treason. On 7 April 1962, all were convicted and sentenced to 30 years in prison. On 14 April 1962, 60 wounded and sick prisoners were freed and transported to the U.S. In 2021, it was discovered that Brazil&#x27;s government, then led by President João Goulart, intervened on behalf of the United States to avoid the death penalty for prisoners.
On 21 December 1962, Castro and James B. Donovan, a U.S. lawyer aided by Milan C. Miskovsky, a CIA legal officer, signed an agreement to exchange 1,113 prisoners for US$53 million in food and medicine, sourced from private donations and from companies expecting tax concessions. On 24 December 1962, some prisoners were flown to Miami, others following on the ship &quot;African Pilot&quot;, plus about 1,000 family members also allowed to leave Cuba. On 29 December 1962, President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline attended a &quot;welcome back&quot; ceremony for Brigade 2506 veterans at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.

===Public statements===
The failed invasion severely embarrassed the Kennedy administration and made Castro wary of future U.S. intervention in Cuba. On 21 April, in a State Department press conference, Kennedy said: &quot;There&#x27;s an old saying that victory has a hundred fathers and defeat is an orphan... Further statements, detailed discussions, are not to conceal responsibility because I&#x27;m the responsible officer of the Government...&quot; The invasion&#x27;s failure initiated Operation Mongoose to destabilize Cuba.

Later, Kennedy told Khrushchev that the Bay of Pigs invasion was a mistake.

The initial U.S. response concerning the first air attacks was of a dismissive quality. Adlai Stevenson denied any involvement in the first wave of airstrikes, stating before the UN, &quot;These charges are totally false and I deny them categorically.&quot; Stevenson continued to promote a story of two Cuban planes that had reportedly defected to the United States, apparently unaware that they were in fact U.S. planes piloted by U.S.-backed Cuban pilots to promote a false story of defection.

In August 1961, during an economic conference of the OAS in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Che Guevara sent a note to Kennedy via Richard N. Goodwin, a secretary of the White House. It read: &quot;Thanks for Playa Girón. Before the invasion, the revolution was weak. Now it&#x27;s stronger than ever&quot;. Additionally, Guevara answered a set of questions from Leo Huberman of &quot;Monthly Review&quot; following the invasion. In one reply, Guevara was asked to explain the growing number of Cuban counter-revolutionaries and defectors from the regime, to which he replied that the repelled invasion was the climax of counter-revolution and that afterward such actions &quot;fell drastically to zero.&quot; Regarding the defections of some prominent figures within the Cuban government, Guevara remarked that this was because &quot;the socialist revolution left the opportunists, the ambitious, and the fearful far behind and now advances toward a new regime free of this class of vermin.&quot;

===Kennedy&#x27;s response===
Allen Dulles later stated, CIA planners believed that once the troops were on the ground, Kennedy would authorize any action required to prevent failure – as Eisenhower had done in Guatemala in 1954 after that invasion looked as if it would collapse. Two of Kennedy&#x27;s advisors, David Powers and Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell, record in their joint memoir that Kennedy believed the only reason the Joint Chiefs of Staff would approve the plan was because &quot;They were sure I&#x27;d give in to them and send the go-ahead order to the Essex, they couldn&#x27;t believe that a new President like me wouldn&#x27;t panic and try and save his own face. Well, they had me figured all wrong&quot;. Kennedy was deeply depressed and angered with the failure. He confided to Arthur Schlesinger Jr. that &quot;I have learned one thing from this business—that is, that we have to deal with CIA...no one has dealt with CIA&quot;. Schlesinger writes that the failure of the invasion &quot;stimulated a wide variety of proposals for the reorganization of the CIA&quot; within the Kennedy administration. Kennedy commented to his journalist friend Ben Bradlee, &quot;The first advice I&#x27;m going to give my successor is to watch the generals and to avoid feeling that because they were military men their opinions on military matters were worth a damn.&quot;

Several years after his death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that he told an unspecified high administration official of wanting &quot;to splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.&quot; However, following a &quot;rigorous inquiry into the agency&#x27;s affairs, methods, and problems... [Kennedy] did not &#x27;splinter&#x27; it after all and did not recommend Congressional supervision.&quot; Although Kennedy did issue two National Security Action Memoranda (no. 55 and 57) in the aftermath of the invasion which redefined the CIA role. Memorandum 55 stated that it was the Joint Chiefs of Staff who had the &quot;responsibility for the defense of the nation in the Cold War&quot; and memorandum 57 restricted the CIA&#x27;s paramilitary operations by stating &quot;Any large paramilitary operation wholly or partly covert which requires significant numbers of militarily trained personnel, amounts of military equipment which exceed normal CIA-controlled stocks and/or military experience of a kind and level peculiar to the Armed Services is properly the primary responsibility of the Department of Defense with the CIA in a supporting role&quot;. He also forced the resignations of the three highest ranking CIA men, Allen Dulles (Director), Charles Cabell (Deputy Director), and Richard M. Bissell Jr. (Deputy Director for Plans).
The aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion and events involving Cuba that followed caused the U.S. to feel threatened by its neighbor. Prior to the events at Playa Girón, the U.S. government imposed sanctions that limited trade with Cuba. An article appearing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; dated 6 January 1960 called trade with Cuba &quot;too risky.&quot; About six months later in July 1960, the U.S. reduced the import quota of Cuban sugar, leaving the U.S. no choice but to maintain its sugar needs from other sources. Immediately following the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Kennedy administration considered a complete embargo. Five months later, the president was authorized to do so.

According to author Jim Rasenberger, the Kennedy administration became very aggressive with regard to overthrowing Castro following the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, reportedly doubling its efforts. Rasenberger elaborated on the fact that almost every decision that was made by Kennedy following the Bay of Pigs had some correlation with the destruction of the Castro administration. Shortly after the invasion ended, Kennedy ordered the Pentagon to design secret operations to overthrow the Castro regime. Also, President Kennedy persuaded his brother Robert to set up a covert action against Castro which was known as &quot;Operation Mongoose.&quot;

===Public reaction===
Only 3 percent of Americans supported military action in 1960. According to Gallup, 72% of people had a negative view of Fidel Castro in 1960. After the conflict, 61% of Americans approved of the action, while 15% disapproved and 24% were unsure. This poll was taken by Gallup in late April 1966. A week after the invasion of Cuba, Gallup took another series of polls to sample three possible ways of opposing Castro. The policy that most resembled the Bay of Pigs (if the US &quot;should aid the anti-Castro forces with money and war materials&quot;) was still favored by a narrow margin, 44% approval to 41% rejecting this policy.

Kennedy&#x27;s general approval rating increased in the first survey after the invasion, rising from 78 percent in mid-April to 83 percent in late April and early May. Dr. Gallup&#x27;s headline for this poll read, &quot;Public Rallies Behind Kennedy in Aftermath of Cuban Crisis.&quot; In 1963 a public opinion poll showed 60 percent of Americans believed that Cuba is &quot;a serious threat to world peace,&quot; yet 63 percent of Americans did not want the U.S. to remove Castro.

===Maxwell Taylor survey===
On 22 April 1961, President Kennedy asked General Maxwell D. Taylor, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Admiral Arleigh Burke and CIA Director Allen Dulles to form the Cuba Study Group, to report on lessons to learn from the failed operation. General Taylor submitted the Board of Inquiry&#x27;s report to President Kennedy on 13 June. It attributed the defeat to lack of early realization of the impossibility of success by covert means, to inadequate aircraft, to limitations on armaments, pilots, and air attacks set to attempt plausible deniability – and, ultimately, to loss of important ships and lack of ammunition. The Taylor Commission was criticized, and bias implied. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the President&#x27;s brother, was included in the group, and the commission collectively was seen to be more preoccupied with deflecting blame from the White House than concerned with discovering why the operation had not been successful. Jack Pfeiffer, who worked as a historian for the CIA until the mid-1980s, simplified his own view of the failed Bay of Pigs effort by quoting a statement which Raúl Castro, Fidel&#x27;s brother, had made to a Mexican journalist in 1975: &quot;Kennedy vacillated. If at that moment he had decided to invade us, he could have suffocated the island in a sea of blood, but he could have destroyed the revolution. Lucky for us, he vacillated.&quot;

===CIA report===

In November 1961, CIA Inspector-General Lyman Kirkpatrick authored a report, &quot;Survey of the Cuban Operation&quot;, that remained classified until 1998. Conclusions were:
# The CIA exceeded its capabilities in developing the project from guerrilla support to overt armed action without any plausible deniability.
# Failure to realistically assess risks and to adequately communicate information and decisions internally and with other government principals.
# Insufficient involvement of leaders of the exiles.
# Failure to sufficiently organize internal resistance in Cuba.
# Failure to competently collect and analyze intelligence about Cuban forces.
# Poor internal management of communications and staff.
# Insufficient employment of high-quality staff.
# Insufficient Spanish-speakers, training facilities, and material resources.
# Lack of stable policies and/or contingency plans.

In spite of vigorous objections by CIA management to the findings, CIA Director Allen Dulles, CIA Deputy Director Charles Cabell, and deputy director for Plans Richard M. Bissell Jr. were all forced to resign by early 1962. In later years, the CIA&#x27;s behavior in the event became the prime example cited for the psychology paradigm known as groupthink syndrome. Further study shows that among various components of groupthink analyzed by Irving Janis, the Bay of Pigs Invasion followed the structural characteristics that led to irrational decision making in foreign policy pushed by deficiency in impartial leadership. An account of the process of invasion planning reads,

Looking at both the &quot;Survey of the Cuban Operation&quot; and &quot;Groupthink: Psychological Studies of Policy Decisions and Fiascoes&quot; by Irving Janis, it identifies the lack of communication and the mere assumption of concurrence to be the main causes behind the CIA and the president&#x27;s collective failure to efficiently evaluate the facts before them. A considerable amount of information presented before President Kennedy proved to be false in reality, such as the support of the Cuban people for Fidel Castro, making it difficult to assess the actual situation and the future of the operation.

In mid-1960, CIA operative E. Howard Hunt had interviewed Cubans in Havana; in a 1997 interview with CNN, he said, &quot;...all I could find was a lot of enthusiasm for Fidel Castro.&quot;

===Schism within Cuban Revolutionary Council===
Soon after the failure of the invasion, the Cuban Revolutionary Council split into rival factions. Manuel Ray broke off to form the &quot;Junta Revolucionario&quot;, and the Student Directorate broke off to manage its own resistance to Castro. Among remaining members of the Cuban Revolutionary Council, a debate erupted as to what the appropriate measures would be regarding regime change. One group argued Carlos Prío Socarrás should be made provisional president, while another group argued that according to the constitution of 1940, a judge should be provisional president.

Other groups engaged in guerrilla warfare in Cuba, including &quot;Rescate&quot;, the Second National Front of Escambray, and the Insurrectionary Revolutionary Movement. Pepin Bosch also petitioned the U.S. government for assistance in forming a Cuban government in exile, which the U.S. rejected. Afterward, small militant groups focused on small raids onto the Cuban coast.

For many Latin Americans, the invasion reinforced the belief that the U.S. could not be trusted. It also showed that the U.S. could be defeated, and thus encouraged political groups in Latin America to counter U.S. influence. Victory made Castro even more popular, fueling nationalistic support for his economic policies. After the air attacks on Cuban airfields on 15 April, he declared the revolution &quot;Marxist-Leninist&quot;.

In March 2001, shortly before the 40th anniversary of the invasion, a conference took place in Havana, attended by about 60 American delegates. The conference was titled Bay of Pigs: 40 Years After. The conference was co-sponsored by the University of Havana, Centro de Estudios Sobre Estados Unidos, Instituto de Historia de Cuba, Centro de Investigaciones Históricas de la Seguridad del Estado; Centro de Estudios Sobre America, and the U.S.-based National Security Archive. It commenced on Thursday 22 March 2001 at the Hotel Palco, , La Habana. On 24 March, after the conference, many of the delegates and observers travelled by road to Australia sugar mill, Playa Larga, and Playa Girón, the site of the initial landing in the invasion. A documentary film was made of that trip, titled &quot;Cuba: The 40 Years War&quot;, released on DVD in 2002. A Cuban FAR combatant at the Bay of Pigs, José Ramón Fernández, attended the conference, as did four members of Brigade 2506, Roberto Carballo, Mario Cabello, Alfredo Duran, and Luis Tornes.

There are still yearly nationwide drills in Cuba during the &#x27;Día de la Defensa&#x27; (Defense Day), to prepare the population for an invasion.

===Memory among Cuban exiles===
Many who fought for the CIA in the conflict remained loyal to the US after the event; some Bay of Pigs veterans became officers in the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, including 6 colonels, 19 lieutenant colonels, 9 majors, and 29 captains. By March 2007, about half of the brigade had died. In April 2010, the Cuban Pilot&#x27;s Association unveiled a monument at the Miami Executive Airport in memory of the 16 aviators for the exile side killed during the battle. The memorial consists of an obelisk and a restored B-26 replica aircraft atop a large Cuban flag.

In the United States, a popular historical reading of the invasion is known as &quot;Kennedy&#x27;s betrayal&quot;, which proposes that President Kennedy&#x27;s refusal to give proper air support to Brigade 2506 caused the defeat of the invasion. This lack of air support later spurred a sense that John F. Kennedy had betrayed Brigade 2506. According to some, including Grayston Lynch, Felipe Rivero, and Higinio &quot;Nino&quot; Díaz, this caused Cuban exiles to view JFK as soft on communism. This soft reputation also supposedly pushed early Cuban exiles to vote Republican in contrast to Kennedy&#x27;s own Democratic party, creating a long tradition of popular support for the Republican party among Cuban Americans. The supposed immediate distaste for Kennedy among early Cuban exiles has also inspired conspiracy theories that Cuban exiles were involved in Kennedy&#x27;s assassination.

<text>Ralph Vinton Lyon Hartley (November 30, 1888 – May 1, 1970) was an American electronics researcher. He invented the Hartley oscillator and the Hartley transform, and contributed to the foundations of information theory.

His legacy includes the naming of the hartley, a unit of information equal to one decimal digit, after him.

==Biography==

Hartley was born in Sprucemont, Nevada, and attended the University of Utah, receiving an A.B. degree in 1909. He became a Rhodes Scholar at St Johns, Oxford University, in 1910 and received a B.A. degree in 1912 and a B.Sc. degree in 1913. He married Florence Vail of Brooklyn on March 21, 1916. The Hartleys had no children.

He returned to the United States and was employed at the Research Laboratory of the Western Electric Company. In 1915 he was in charge of radio receiver development for the Bell System transatlantic radiotelephone tests. For this he developed the Hartley oscillator and also a neutralizing circuit to eliminate triode singing resulting from internal coupling. A patent for the oscillator was filed on June 1, 1915 and awarded on October 26, 1920.

During World War I Hartley established the principles that led to sound-type directional finders.

Following the war he returned to Western Electric. He later worked at Bell Laboratories. He performed research on repeaters and voice and carrier transmission and formulated the law &quot;that the total amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to frequency range transmitted and the time of the transmission.&quot; His 1928 paper is considered as &quot;the single most important prerequisite&quot; for Shannon&#x27;s theory of information. After about 10 years of illness he returned to Bell Labs in 1939 as a consultant.

In spite of his illness during most of the 1930s, Hartley had formed a theoretical and experimental research group at Bell Laboratories starting in 1929 to investigate nonlinear oscillations and what later became known as parametric amplifiers. This research was mostly parallel to the work being done at the same time in Soviet Russia by Leonid Mandelstam and in Europe by Balthasar van der Pol. A short review and extensive bibliography was published by Mumford in 1960.
The Bell Laboratories work was carried on under Hartley&#x27;s guidance during the 1930s and 1940s by John Burton and Eugene Peterson (who themselves had begun investigations of nonlinear circuits as far back as 1917 when they had observed unusual characteristics while working with E.F.W. Alexanderson&#x27;s magnetic modulators, an early form of magnetic amplifier). Peterson later got John Manley and Harrison Rowe involved in this line of research during the 1940s which culminated in the now famous Manley–Rowe relations and several papers by the latter two authors on the topic of parametric circuits in the mid 1950s.

During World War II he was particularly involved with servomechanism problems.

He retired from Bell Labs in 1950 and died on May 1, 1970.

<text>Uncrewed spacecraft or robotic spacecraft are spacecraft without people on board. Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input, such as remote control, or remote guidance. They may also be autonomous, in which they have a pre-programmed list of operations that will be executed unless otherwise instructed. A robotic spacecraft for scientific measurements is often called a space probe or space observatory.

Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit.

The first uncrewed space mission was &quot;Sputnik&quot;, launched October 4, 1957 to orbit the Earth. Nearly all satellites, landers and rovers are robotic spacecraft. Not every uncrewed spacecraft is a robotic spacecraft; for example, a reflector ball is a non-robotic uncrewed spacecraft. Space missions where other animals but no humans are on-board are called uncrewed missions.

Many habitable spacecraft also have varying levels of robotic features. For example, the space stations Salyut 7 and Mir, and the International Space Station module Zarya, were capable of remote guided station-keeping and docking maneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules. Uncrewed resupply spacecraft are increasingly used for crewed space stations.

==History==

The first robotic spacecraft was launched by the Soviet Union (USSR) on 22 July 1951, a suborbital flight carrying two dogs Dezik and Tsygan. Four other such flights were made through the fall of 1951.

The first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, was put into a Earth orbit by the USSR on 4 October 1957. On 3 November 1957, the USSR orbited Sputnik 2. Weighing , Sputnik 2 carried the first animal into orbit, the dog Laika. Since the satellite was not designed to detach from its launch vehicle&#x27;s upper stage, the total mass in orbit was .

In a close race with the Soviets, the United States launched its first artificial satellite, Explorer 1, into a orbit on 31 January 1958. Explorer I was an long by diameter cylinder weighing , compared to Sputnik 1, a sphere which weighed . Explorer 1 carried sensors which confirmed the existence of the Van Allen belts, a major scientific discovery at the time, while Sputnik 1 carried no scientific sensors. On 17 March 1958, the US orbited its second satellite, Vanguard 1, which was about the size of a grapefruit, and which remains in a orbit .

The first attempted lunar probe was the Luna E-1 No.1, launched on 23 September 1958. The goal of a lunar probe repeatedly failed until 4 January 1959 when Luna 1 orbited around the Moon and then the Sun.

The success of these early missions began a race between the US and the USSR to outdo each other with increasingly ambitious probes. &quot;Mariner 2&quot; was the first probe to study another planet, revealing Venus&#x27; extremely hot temperature to scientists in 1962, while the Soviet &quot;Venera 4&quot; was the first atmospheric probe to study Venus. &quot;Mariner 4&quot; 1965 Mars flyby snapped the first images of its cratered surface, which the Soviets responded to a few months later with images from on its surface from &quot;Luna 9&quot;. In 1967, America&#x27;s &quot;Surveyor 3&quot; gathered information about the Moon&#x27;s surface that would prove crucial to the Apollo 11 mission that landed humans on the Moon two years later.

The first interstellar probe was &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, launched 5 September 1977. It entered interstellar space on 25 August 2012, followed by its twin &quot;Voyager 2&quot; on 5 November 2018.

Nine other countries have successfully launched satellites using their own launch vehicles: France (1965), Japan and China (1970), the United Kingdom (1971), India (1980), Israel (1988), Iran (2009), North Korea (2012), and South Korea (2022).

==Design==
In spacecraft design, the United States Air Force considers a vehicle to consist of the mission payload and the bus (or platform). The bus provides physical structure, thermal control, electrical power, attitude control and telemetry, tracking and commanding.

JPL divides the &quot;flight system&quot; of a spacecraft into subsystems. These include:

=== Structure ===
The physical backbone structure, which

* provides overall mechanical integrity of the spacecraft
* ensures spacecraft components are supported and can withstand launch loads

=== Data handling ===
This is sometimes referred to as the command and data subsystem. It is often responsible for:

* command sequence storage
* maintaining the spacecraft clock
* collecting and reporting spacecraft telemetry data (e.g. spacecraft health)
* collecting and reporting mission data (e.g. photographic images)

=== Attitude determination and control ===
This system is mainly responsible for the correct spacecraft&#x27;s orientation in space (attitude) despite external disturbance-gravity gradient effects, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag; in addition it may be required to reposition movable parts, such as antennas and solar arrays.

==== Entry, descent, and landing ====
Integrated sensing incorporates an image transformation algorithm to interpret the immediate imagery land data, perform a real-time detection and avoidance of terrain hazards that may impede safe landing, and increase the accuracy of landing at a desired site of interest using landmark localization techniques. Integrated sensing completes these tasks by relying on pre-recorded information and cameras to understand its location and determine its position and whether it is correct or needs to make any corrections (localization). The cameras are also used to detect any possible hazards whether it is increased fuel consumption or it is a physical hazard such as a poor landing spot in a crater or cliff side that would make landing very not ideal (hazard assessment).

===== Landing on hazardous terrain =====
In planetary exploration missions involving robotic spacecraft, there are three key parts in the processes of landing on the surface of the planet to ensure a safe and successful landing. This process includes an entry into the planetary gravity field and atmosphere, a descent through that atmosphere towards an intended/targeted region of scientific value, and a safe landing that guarantees the integrity of the instrumentation on the craft is preserved. While the robotic spacecraft is going through those parts, it must also be capable of estimating its position compared to the surface in order to ensure reliable control of itself and its ability to maneuver well. The robotic spacecraft must also efficiently perform hazard assessment and trajectory adjustments in real time to avoid hazards. To achieve this, the robotic spacecraft requires accurate knowledge of where the spacecraft is located relative to the surface (localization), what may pose as hazards from the terrain (hazard assessment), and where the spacecraft should presently be headed (hazard avoidance). Without the capability for operations for localization, hazard assessment, and avoidance, the robotic spacecraft becomes unsafe and can easily enter dangerous situations such as surface collisions, undesirable fuel consumption levels, and/or unsafe maneuvers.

=== Telecommunications ===
Components in the telecommunications subsystem include radio antennas, transmitters and receivers. These may be used to communicate with ground stations on Earth, or with other spacecraft.

==== Electrical power ====
The supply of electric power on spacecraft generally come from photovoltaic (solar) cells or from a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Other components of the subsystem include batteries for storing power and distribution circuitry that connects components to the power sources.

=== Temperature control and protection from the environment ===
Spacecraft are often protected from temperature fluctuations with insulation. Some spacecraft use mirrors and sunshades for additional protection from solar heating. They also often need shielding from micrometeoroids and orbital debris.

=== Propulsion ===
Spacecraft propulsion is a method that allows a spacecraft to travel through space by generating thrust to push it forward. However, there is not one universally used propulsion system: monopropellant, bipropellant, ion propulsion, etc. Each propulsion system generates thrust in slightly different ways with each system having its own advantages and disadvantages. But, most spacecraft propulsion today is based on rocket engines. The general idea behind rocket engines is that when an oxidizer meets the fuel source, there is explosive release of energy and heat at high speeds, which propels the spacecraft forward. This happens due to one basic principle known as Newton&#x27;s Third Law. According to Newton, &quot;to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot; As the energy and heat is being released from the back of the spacecraft, gas particles are being pushed around to allow the spacecraft to propel forward. The main reason behind the usage of rocket engine today is because rockets are the most powerful form of propulsion there is.

==== Monopropellant ====
For a propulsion system to work, there is usually an oxidizer line and a fuel line. This way, the spacecraft propulsion is controlled. But in a monopropellant propulsion, there is no need for an oxidizer line and only requires the fuel line. This works due to the oxidizer being chemically bonded into the fuel molecule itself. But for the propulsion system to be controlled, the combustion of the fuel can only occur due to a presence of a catalyst. This is quite advantageous due to making the rocket engine lighter and cheaper, easy to control, and more reliable. But, the downfall is that the chemical is very dangerous to manufacture, store, and transport.

==== Bipropellant ====
A bipropellant propulsion system is a rocket engine that uses a liquid propellant. This means both the oxidizer and fuel line are in liquid states. This system is unique because it requires no ignition system, the two liquids would spontaneously combust as soon as they come into contact with each other and produces the propulsion to push the spacecraft forward. The main benefit for having this technology is because that these kinds of liquids have relatively high density, which allows the volume of the propellent tank to be small, therefore increasing space efficacy. The downside is the same as that of monopropellant propulsion system: very dangerous to manufacture, store, and transport.

==== Ion ====
An ion propulsion system is a type of engine that generates thrust by the means of electron bombardment or the acceleration of ions. By shooting high-energy electrons to a propellant atom (neutrally charge), it removes electrons from the propellant atom and this results in the propellant atom becoming a positively charged atom. The positively charged ions are guided to pass through positively charged grids that contains thousands of precise aligned holes are running at high voltages. Then, the aligned positively charged ions accelerates through a negative charged accelerator grid that further increases the speed of the ions up to . The momentum of these positively charged ions provides the thrust to propel the spacecraft forward. The advantage of having this kind of propulsion is that it is incredibly efficient in maintaining constant velocity, which is needed for deep-space travel. However, the amount of thrust produced is extremely low and that it needs a lot of electrical power to operate.

=== Mechanical devices ===
Mechanical components often need to be moved for deployment after launch or prior to landing. In addition to the use of motors, many one-time movements are controlled by pyrotechnic devices.

===Robotic vs. uncrewed spacecraft===
Robotic spacecraft are specifically designed system for a specific hostile environment. Due to their specification for a particular environment, it varies greatly in complexity and capabilities. While an uncrewed spacecraft is a spacecraft without personnel or crew and is operated by automatic (proceeds with an action without human intervention) or remote control (with human intervention). The term &#x27;uncrewed spacecraft&#x27; does not imply that the spacecraft is robotic.

==Control==
Robotic spacecraft use telemetry to radio back to Earth acquired data and vehicle status information. Although generally referred to as &quot;remotely controlled&quot; or &quot;telerobotic&quot;, the earliest orbital spacecraft – such as Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1 – did not receive control signals from Earth. Soon after these first spacecraft, command systems were developed to allow remote control from the ground. Increased autonomy is important for distant probes where the light travel time prevents rapid decision and control from Earth. Newer probes such as &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; and the Mars Exploration Rovers are highly autonomous and use on-board computers to operate independently for extended periods of time.

==Space probes and observatories==
A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that does not orbit Earth, but instead, explores further into outer space. Space probes have different sets of scientific instruments onboard. A space probe may approach the Moon; travel through interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or enter interstellar space. Space probes send collected data to Earth. Space probes can be orbiters, landers, and rovers. Space probes can also gather materials from its target and return it to Earth.

Once a probe has left the vicinity of Earth, its trajectory will likely take it along an orbit around the Sun similar to the Earth&#x27;s orbit. To reach another planet, the simplest practical method is a Hohmann transfer orbit. More complex techniques, such as gravitational slingshots, can be more fuel-efficient, though they may require the probe to spend more time in transit. Some high Delta-V missions (such as those with high inclination changes) can only be performed, within the limits of modern propulsion, using gravitational slingshots. A technique using very little propulsion, but requiring a considerable amount of time, is to follow a trajectory on the Interplanetary Transport Network.

A space telescope or space observatory is a telescope in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation which they observe, and avoid light pollution which ground-based observatories encounter. They are divided into two types: satellites which map the entire sky (astronomical survey), and satellites which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond. Space telescopes are distinct from Earth imaging satellites, which point toward Earth for satellite imaging, applied for weather analysis, espionage, and other types of information gathering.

== Cargo spacecraft ==
Cargo or resupply spacecraft are robotic vehicles designed to transport supplies, such as food, propellant, and equipment, to space stations. This distinguishes them from space probes, which are primarily focused on scientific exploration.

Automated cargo spacecraft have been servicing space stations since 1978, supporting missions like Salyut 6, Salyut 7, Mir, the International Space Station (ISS), and the Tiangong space station.

Currently, the ISS relies on three types of cargo spacecraft: the Russian Progress, along with the American Cargo Dragon 2, and Cygnus. China&#x27;s Tiangong space station is solely supplied by the Tianzhou.

The American Dream Chaser and Japanese HTV-X are under development for future use with the ISS. The European Automated Transfer Vehicle was previously used between 2008 and 2015.

<doc id="184534" wikidata="Q447698" url="?curid=184534" title="Danny Carey">
<text>Daniel Edwin Carey (born May 10, 1961) is an American musician and songwriter who is the drummer for the progressive metal band Tool. He has also contributed to albums by artists such as Zaum, Green Jellö, Pigface, Skinny Puppy, Adrian Belew, Carole King, Collide, Meat Puppets, Lusk, and the Melvins.

He was ranked among the 100 greatest drummers of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, occupying the 26th position, in addition to being frequently considered by other magazines.

==Biography==
Born in Lawrence, Kansas, Carey&#x27;s first encounter with the drums began at the age of ten when he joined the school band and began taking private lessons on the snare drum. Two years later, Carey began to practice on a drum set. In his senior year of high school in Paola, Kansas, Carey joined the high school jazz band. Carey also played basketball. Jazz would later play a huge role in his signature approach to the drum set in a rock setting. As Carey progressed through high school and later college at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, he began expanding his studies in percussion with theory into the principles of geometry, science, and metaphysics as well as delving into the occult. Carey also played jazz while attending college and got to experience the jazz scene in Kansas City.

After college, a friend and bandmate convinced Carey to leave Kansas for Portland, Oregon, where he played briefly in various bands before moving to Los Angeles, where he was able to perform as a studio drummer with Carole King and perform live sets with Pigmy Love Circus. During this period he played in a country band, the Wild Blue Yonder, with Jeff Buckley and John Humphrey. He also played in Green Jellö as &quot;Danny Longlegs&quot; and recorded the album &quot;Cereal Killer&quot;. He would later find his way to Tool after coming to know singer Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones and practicing with them in place of drummers the two had requested but had never shown up. Besides Tool, Carey also finds time for other projects new and old such as Legend of the Seagullmen, Pigmy Love Circus, Volto!, and Zaum.

===Legal issues===
Carey was arrested at the Kansas City International Airport on December 12, 2021, after allegedly using a homophobic slur and repeatedly jabbing someone in the chest with two fingers. He was charged with a municipal assault violation. The charges were dropped in January 2023.

==Influences==
Carey&#x27;s drumming influences include Neil Peart, Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford, Lenny White, Stewart Copeland, Tony Williams, John Bonham, Barriemore Barlow and Tim Alexander.

==Equipment==
Danny Carey uses the wood tip version of his own signature model of drumstick made by Vic Firth. He previously had endorsed a signature model with Trueline Drumsticks (now Trueline&#x27;s Tribal Assault model).
Carey also uses Sonor drums, Paiste cymbals, Evans drumheads, Hammerax, and electronic devices such as Mandala, Korg and Roland.

Paiste and Jeff Ocheltree (noted drumtech for Billy Cobham, John Bonham, Lenny White, etc) teamed up in the late 90s to develop an entire drumset made out of recycled cymbals. The final product was a melted down Paiste&#x27;s Signature bronze custom cast cymbals. Danny Carey used the kit during the Lateralus 2002 tour and during some drum clinics through the years.

Only three versions of this kit were ever created. Carey and Carl Palmer each own one, while the third resides at Paiste&#x27;s Switzerland headquarters.

At the 2009 Winter NAMM Show Sonor released a Danny Carey signature snare drum, which is a 1 mm thick bronze 14x8&quot; snare with laser etched talisman symbols and his signature engraved around the vent hole.

In 2016 Paiste released a Danny Carey signature ride cymbal called &quot;Dry Heavy Ride - Monad&quot; based on their discontinued model that Carey always used since becoming a Paiste artist. The cymbal has a purple color and sigils printed on. It is named &quot;Monad&quot; because the main print is an esoteric glyph from John Dee.

During 2019, builder Alan Van Kleef from VK Drums was contacted by Carey to create a drum kit and a snare drum. After much debate Alan developed the set called &quot;Monad&quot;, made by hand in Sheffield, England. Shortly after the completion of the Monad set, it was announced that a snare drum replica called &quot;7empest&quot; (after Tool&#x27;s grammy award winning song) would be made available as part of a limited collection of 33 individual pieces. At the same time that the 7empest snare was launched, Alan was also developing the first complete 7empest drum set. Like the snare, the 7empest drums is a Monad replica in almost every way, except for the engravings.

==Drumming techniques==

Carey&#x27;s popularity among drummers and non-drummers alike stems from the diversity of his sound and dynamics through his years of learning jazz music, his technical ability, frequent use of odd time signatures, polyrhythms, and polymeters. He has stated in interviews that he effectively treats his feet as he does his hands: he practices rudiments (used for sticking techniques) and even snare drum solos with his feet to improve his double bass drumming, hi-hat control, and foot independence.

In search of new techniques, Carey has studied tabla with Aloke Dutta, who can be heard playing on the live version of the song &quot;Pushit&quot; (from &quot;Salival&quot;). This is especially apparent on tracks such as &quot;Disposition&quot; (&quot;Lateralus&quot;) or &quot;Right in Two&quot; (&quot;10,000 Days&quot;), for which Carey has recorded the tabla parts himself in the studio. The tabla (and other percussive instruments) used in Tool&#x27;s music are replicated live using the Mandala pads (in fact the pads are also used when recording in the studio, a notable example being the tabla solo of &quot;Right in Two&quot;).

He has also stated that when he is playing to an odd time signature, he tries to drum to the &quot;feel&quot; of the song and establish general &quot;inner pulse&quot; for the given time signature instead of fully counting it out.

Carey has been featured in many drum and music magazines.

<text>Armenian numerals form a historic numeral system created using the majuscules (uppercase letters) of the Armenian alphabet.

There was no notation for zero in the old system, and the numeric values for individual letters were added together. The principles behind this system are the same as for the ancient Greek numerals and Hebrew numerals. In modern Armenia, the familiar Arabic numerals are used. In contemporary writing, Armenian numerals are used more or less like Roman numerals in modern English, e.g. Գարեգին Բ. means Garegin II and Գ. գլուխ means &quot;Chapter III&quot; (as a headline).

The final two letters of the Armenian alphabet, &quot;o&quot; (Օ) and &quot;fe&quot; (Ֆ), were added to the Armenian alphabet only after Arabic numerals were already in use, to facilitate transliteration of other languages. Thus, they sometimes have a numerical value assigned to them.

== Notation ==

As in Hebrew and ancient notation, in Armenian numerals distinct symbols represent multiples of powers of 10, from 1 to 9, 10 to 90, 100 to 900, 1,000 to 9,000, and 10,000 and 20,000. A number is written from left to right, composed from at most one of these symbols for each power of 10, arranged in descending order by magnitude. There is no symbol for zero: for a number like 600 or 9,007, missing powers of ten are simply not represented.

To write numbers greater than 9,999, it is necessary to have numerals with values greater than 9,000. This is done by drawing a line over them, indicating that their value is to be multiplied by 10,000. This is similar to Roman numerals, where a line over a character means multiplying the corresponding value by 1,000.
==Examples==
* . = 1975 = 1000 + 900 + 70 + 5
* . = 2222 = 2000 + 200 + 20 + 2
* . = 120 = 100 + 20
* . = 2004 = 2000 + 4
* . = 50
* Ա. = 10,000 = 1 10,000
* Ջ. = 9,000,000 = 900 10,000
* ՌՃԽԳ. = 11,431,255 = 1,143 10,000 + 1,255

<doc id="184539" wikidata="Q619511" url="?curid=184539" title="Chebyshev polynomials">
<text>The Chebyshev polynomials are two sequences of polynomials related to the cosine and sine functions, notated as formula_1 and formula_2. They can be defined in several equivalent ways, one of which starts with trigonometric functions:

The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind formula_3 are defined by:
formula_4

Similarly, the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind formula_5 are defined by:
formula_6

That these expressions define polynomials in formula_7 may not be obvious at first sight but follows by rewriting formula_8 and formula_9 using de Moivre&#x27;s formula or by using the angle sum formulas for formula_10 and formula_11 repeatedly. For example, the double angle formulas, which follow directly from the angle sum formulas, may be used to obtain formula_12 and formula_13, which are respectively a polynomial in formula_7 and a polynomial in formula_7 multiplied by formula_16. Hence formula_17 and formula_18.

An important and convenient property of the is that they are &quot;orthogonal&quot; with respect to the following inner product:
formula_19
and are orthogonal with respect to another, analogous inner product, given below.

The Chebyshev polynomials are polynomials with the largest possible leading coefficient whose absolute value on the interval is bounded by 1. They are also the &quot;extremal&quot; polynomials for many other properties.

In 1952, Cornelius Lanczos showed that the Chebyshev polynomials are important in approximation theory for the solution of linear systems; the roots of , which are also called &quot;Chebyshev nodes&quot;, are used as matching points for optimizing polynomial interpolation. The resulting interpolation polynomial minimizes the problem of Runge&#x27;s phenomenon and provides an approximation that is close to the best polynomial approximation to a continuous function under the maximum norm, also called the &quot;minimax&quot; criterion. This approximation leads directly to the method of Clenshaw–Curtis quadrature.

These polynomials were named after Pafnuty Chebyshev. The letter is used because of the alternative transliterations of the name &quot;Chebyshev&quot; as , (French) or (German).

==Definitions==

=== Recurrence definition ===
The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are obtained from the recurrence relation:
formula_20
The recurrence also allows to represent them explicitly as the determinant of a tridiagonal matrix of size formula_21:

formula_22

The ordinary generating function for is:
formula_23
There are several other generating functions for the Chebyshev polynomials; the exponential generating function is:
formula_24

The generating function relevant for 2-dimensional potential theory and multipole expansion is:
formula_25
The Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are defined by the recurrence relation:
formula_26
Notice that the two sets of recurrence relations are identical, except for formula_27 vs. The ordinary generating function for is:
formula_28
and the exponential generating function is:
formula_29

===Trigonometric definition===
As described in the introduction, the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind can be defined as the unique polynomials satisfying:
formula_30
or, in other words, as the unique polynomials satisfying:
formula_31
for .

The polynomials of the second kind satisfy:
formula_32
or
formula_33
which is structurally quite similar to the Dirichlet kernel :
formula_34
(The Dirichlet kernel, in fact, coincides with what is now known as the Chebyshev polynomial of the fourth kind.)

An equivalent way to state this is via exponentiation of a complex number: given a complex number with absolute value of one:
formula_35
Chebyshev polynomials can be defined in this form when studying trigonometric polynomials.

That is an th-degree polynomial in can be seen by observing that is the real part of one side of de Moivre&#x27;s formula:
formula_36
The real part of the other side is a polynomial in and , in which all powers of are even and thus replaceable through the identity . 
By the same reasoning, is the imaginary part of the polynomial, in which all powers of are odd and thus, if one factor of is factored out, the remaining factors can be replaced to create a st-degree polynomial in .

===Commuting polynomials definition===

Chebyshev polynomials can also be characterized by the following theorem:

If formula_37 is a family of monic polynomials with coefficients in a field of characteristic formula_38 such that formula_39 and formula_40 for all 
formula_41 and formula_42, then, up to a simple change of variables, either formula_43 for all formula_42 or 
formula_45 for all formula_42.

===Pell equation definition===
The Chebyshev polynomials can also be defined as the solutions to the Pell equation:
formula_47
in a ring . Thus, they can be generated by the standard technique for Pell equations of taking powers of a fundamental solution:
formula_48

==Relations between the two kinds of Chebyshev polynomials==
The Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds correspond to a complementary pair of Lucas sequences and with parameters and :
formula_49
It follows that they also satisfy a pair of mutual recurrence equations:
formula_50

The second of these may be rearranged using the recurrence definition for the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind to give:
formula_51

Using this formula iteratively gives the sum formula:
formula_52
while replacing formula_2 and formula_54 using the derivative formula for formula_1 gives the recurrence relationship for the derivative of formula_3:

formula_57

This relationship is used in the Chebyshev spectral method of solving differential equations.

Turán&#x27;s inequalities for the Chebyshev polynomials are:
formula_58

The integral relations are
formula_59
where integrals are considered as principal value.

==Explicit expressions==
Different approaches to defining Chebyshev polynomials lead to different explicit expressions. The trigonometric definition gives an explicit formula as follows:
formula_60
From this trigonometric form, the recurrence definition can be recovered by computing directly that the bases cases hold:
formula_61
and
formula_62
and that the product-to-sum identity holds:
formula_63

Using the complex number exponentiation definition of the Chebyshev polynomial, one can derive the following expression:
formula_64
formula_65
The two are equivalent because formula_66.

An explicit form of the Chebyshev polynomial in terms of monomials follows from de Moivre&#x27;s formula:
formula_67
where denotes the real part of a complex number. Expanding the formula, one gets:
formula_68
The real part of the expression is obtained from summands corresponding to even indices. Noting formula_69 and formula_70, one gets the explicit formula:
formula_71
which in turn means that:
formula_72
This can be written as a hypergeometric function:
formula_73
with inverse:

formula_74
where the prime at the summation symbol indicates that the contribution of needs to be halved if it appears.

A related expression for as a sum of monomials with binomial coefficients and powers of two is
formula_75

Similarly, can be expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions:
formula_76

==Properties==

===Symmetry===

formula_77

That is, Chebyshev polynomials of even order have even symmetry and therefore contain only even powers of . Chebyshev polynomials of odd order have odd symmetry and therefore contain only odd powers of .

===Roots and extrema===
A Chebyshev polynomial of either kind with degree has different simple roots, called Chebyshev roots, in the interval . The roots of the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind are sometimes called Chebyshev nodes because they are used as &quot;nodes&quot; in polynomial interpolation. Using the trigonometric definition and the fact that:
formula_78
one can show that the roots of are:
formula_79
Similarly, the roots of are:
formula_80
The extrema of on the interval are located at:
formula_81

One unique property of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is that on the interval all of the extrema have values that are either −1 or 1. Thus these polynomials have only two finite critical values, the defining property of Shabat polynomials. Both the first and second kinds of Chebyshev polynomial have extrema at the endpoints, given by:
formula_82

The extrema of formula_1 on the interval formula_84 where formula_85 are located at formula_86 values of formula_87. They are formula_88, or formula_89 where formula_90, formula_91, formula_92 and formula_93, i.e., formula_94 and formula_95 are relatively prime numbers.

Specifically, when formula_96 is even: 
* formula_97 if formula_98, or formula_90 and formula_100 is even. There are formula_101 such values of formula_87.
* formula_103 if formula_90 and formula_100 is odd. There are formula_106 such values of formula_87.

When formula_96 is odd: 
* formula_97 if formula_110, or formula_90 and formula_100 is even. There are formula_113 such values of formula_87.
* formula_103 if formula_116, or formula_90 and formula_100 is odd. There are formula_113 such values of formula_87.

This result has been generalized to solutions of formula_121, and to formula_122 and formula_123 for Chebyshev polynomials of the third and fourth kinds, respectively.

===Differentiation and integration===
The derivatives of the polynomials can be less than straightforward. By differentiating the polynomials in their trigonometric forms, it can be shown that:
formula_124

The last two formulas can be numerically troublesome due to the division by zero ( indeterminate form, specifically) at and . By L&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule:
formula_125

More generally,
formula_126
which is of great use in the numerical solution of eigenvalue problems.

Also, we have:
formula_127
where the prime at the summation symbols means that the term contributed by is to be halved, if it appears.

Concerning integration, the first derivative of the implies that:
formula_128
and the recurrence relation for the first kind polynomials involving derivatives establishes that for :
formula_129

The last formula can be further manipulated to express the integral of as a function of Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind only:
formula_130

Furthermore, we have:
formula_131

===Products of Chebyshev polynomials===
The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind satisfy the relation:
formula_132
which is easily proved from the product-to-sum formula for the cosine:
formula_133
For this results in the already known recurrence formula, just arranged differently, and with it forms the recurrence relation for all even or all odd indexed Chebyshev polynomials (depending on the parity of the lowest ) which implies the evenness or oddness of these polynomials. Three more useful formulas for evaluating Chebyshev polynomials can be concluded from this product expansion:
formula_134

The polynomials of the second kind satisfy the similar relation:
formula_135
(with the definition by convention ). They also satisfy:
formula_136
for .
For this recurrence reduces to:
formula_137
which establishes the evenness or oddness of the even or odd indexed Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind depending on whether starts with 2 or 3.

===Composition and divisibility properties===
The trigonometric definitions of and imply the composition or nesting properties:
formula_138
For the order of composition may be reversed, making the family of polynomial functions a commutative semigroup under composition.

Since is divisible by if is odd, it follows that is divisible by if is odd. Furthermore, is divisible by , and in the case that is even, divisible by .

===Orthogonality===
Both and form a sequence of orthogonal polynomials. The polynomials of the first kind are orthogonal with respect to the weight:
formula_139
on the interval , i.e. we have:
formula_140

This can be proven by letting and using the defining identity .

Similarly, the polynomials of the second kind are orthogonal with respect to the weight:
formula_141
on the interval , i.e. we have:
formula_142

(The measure is, to within a normalizing constant, the Wigner semicircle distribution.)

These orthogonality properties follow from the fact that the Chebyshev polynomials solve the Chebyshev differential equations:
formula_143which are Sturm–Liouville differential equations. It is a general feature of such differential equations that there is a distinguished orthonormal set of solutions. (Another way to define the Chebyshev polynomials is as the solutions to those equations.)

The also satisfy a discrete orthogonality condition:
formula_144
where is any integer greater than , and the are the Chebyshev nodes (see above) of :
formula_145

For the polynomials of the second kind and any integer with the same Chebyshev nodes , there are similar sums:
formula_146
and without the weight function:
formula_147

For any integer , based on the zeros of :
formula_148
one can get the sum:
formula_149
and again without the weight function:
formula_150

===Minimal -norm===
For any given , among the polynomials of degree with leading coefficient 1 (monic polynomials):
formula_151
is the one of which the maximal absolute value on the interval is minimal.

This maximal absolute value is:
formula_152
and reaches this maximum exactly times at:
formula_153

T_n(x)\right| \\
f_n(x) &amp;&gt; 0 \qquad \text{ for }~ x = \cos \frac{2k\pi}{n} ~&amp;&amp;\text{ where } 0 \le 2k \le n \\
f_n(x) &amp;&lt; 0 \qquad \text{ for }~ x = \cos \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{n} ~&amp;&amp;\text{ where } 0 \le 2k + 1 \le n
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

From the intermediate value theorem, has at least roots. However, this is impossible, as is a polynomial of degree , so the fundamental theorem of algebra implies it has at most roots.

====Remark====
By the equioscillation theorem, among all the polynomials of degree , the polynomial minimizes on if and only if there are points such that .

Of course, the null polynomial on the interval can be approximated by itself and minimizes the -norm.

Above, however, reaches its maximum only times because we are searching for the best polynomial of degree (therefore the theorem evoked previously cannot be used).

===Chebyshev polynomials as special cases of more general polynomial families===
The Chebyshev polynomials are a special case of the ultraspherical or Gegenbauer polynomials formula_154, which themselves are a special case of the Jacobi polynomials formula_155:
formula_156

Chebyshev polynomials are also a special case of Dickson polynomials:
formula_157 
formula_158
In particular, when formula_159, they are related by formula_160 and formula_161.

===Other properties===
The curves given by , or equivalently, by the parametric equations , , are a special case of Lissajous curves with frequency ratio equal to .

Similar to the formula:
formula_162
we have the analogous formula:
formula_163

For :
formula_164
and:
formula_165
which follows from the fact that this holds by definition for .

There are relations between Legendre polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials

formula_166

formula_167

These identities can be proven using generating functions and discrete convolution

==Examples==

===First kind===
The first few Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind are 
formula_168

===Second kind===
The first few Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind are 
formula_169

==As a basis set==
In the appropriate Sobolev space, the set of Chebyshev polynomials form an orthonormal basis, so that a function in the same space can, on , be expressed via the expansion:
formula_170

Furthermore, as mentioned previously, the Chebyshev polynomials form an orthogonal basis which (among other things) implies that the coefficients can be determined easily through the application of an inner product. This sum is called a Chebyshev series or a Chebyshev expansion.

Since a Chebyshev series is related to a Fourier cosine series through a change of variables, all of the theorems, identities, etc. that apply to Fourier series have a Chebyshev counterpart. These attributes include:

* The Chebyshev polynomials form a complete orthogonal system.
* The Chebyshev series converges to if the function is piecewise smooth and continuous. The smoothness requirement can be relaxed in most cases as long as there are a finite number of discontinuities in and its derivatives.
* At a discontinuity, the series will converge to the average of the right and left limits.

The abundance of the theorems and identities inherited from Fourier series make the Chebyshev polynomials important tools in numeric analysis; for example they are the most popular general purpose basis functions used in the spectral method, often in favor of trigonometric series due to generally faster convergence for continuous functions (Gibbs&#x27; phenomenon is still a problem).

===Example 1===
Consider the Chebyshev expansion of . One can express:
formula_171

One can find the coefficients either through the application of an inner product or by the discrete orthogonality condition. For the inner product:
formula_172
which gives:
formula_173

Alternatively, when the inner product of the function being approximated cannot be evaluated, the discrete orthogonality condition gives an often useful result for &quot;approximate&quot; coefficients:
formula_174
where is the Kronecker delta function and the are the Gauss–Chebyshev zeros of :
formula_175
For any , these approximate coefficients provide an exact approximation to the function at with a controlled error between those points. The exact coefficients are obtained with , thus representing the function exactly at all points in . The rate of convergence depends on the function and its smoothness.

This allows us to compute the approximate coefficients very efficiently through the discrete cosine transform:
formula_176

===Example 2===
To provide another example:
formula_177

===Partial sums===
The partial sums of:
formula_178
are very useful in the approximation of various functions and in the solution of differential equations (see spectral method). Two common methods for determining the coefficients are through the use of the inner product as in Galerkin&#x27;s method and through the use of collocation which is related to interpolation.

As an interpolant, the coefficients of the st partial sum are usually obtained on the Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto points (or Lobatto grid), which results in minimum error and avoids Runge&#x27;s phenomenon associated with a uniform grid. This collection of points corresponds to the extrema of the highest order polynomial in the sum, plus the endpoints and is given by:
formula_179

===Polynomial in Chebyshev form===
An arbitrary polynomial of degree can be written in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. Such a polynomial is of the form:
formula_180

Polynomials in Chebyshev form can be evaluated using the Clenshaw algorithm.

== Families of polynomials related to Chebyshev polynomials ==
Polynomials denoted formula_181 and formula_182 closely related to Chebyshev polynomials are sometimes used. They are defined by:
formula_183
and satisfy:
formula_184
A. F. Horadam called the polynomials formula_181 Vieta–Lucas polynomials and denoted them formula_186. He called the polynomials formula_182 Vieta–Fibonacci polynomials and denoted them Lists of both sets of polynomials are given in Viète&#x27;s &quot;Opera Mathematica&quot;, Chapter IX, Theorems VI and VII. The Vieta–Lucas and Vieta–Fibonacci polynomials of real argument are, up to a power of formula_188 and a shift of index in the case of the latter, equal to Lucas and Fibonacci polynomials and of imaginary argument.

Shifted Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds are related to the Chebyshev polynomials by:
formula_189

When the argument of the Chebyshev polynomial satisfies the argument of the shifted Chebyshev polynomial satisfies . Similarly, one can define shifted polynomials for generic intervals .

Around 1990 the terms &quot;third-kind&quot; and &quot;fourth-kind&quot; came into use in connection with Chebyshev polynomials, although the polynomials denoted by these terms had an earlier development under the name airfoil polynomials. According to J. C. Mason and G. H. Elliott, the terminology &quot;third-kind&quot; and &quot;fourth-kind&quot; is due to Walter Gautschi, &quot;in consultation with colleagues in the field of orthogonal polynomials.&quot; The Chebyshev polynomials of the third kind are defined as:
formula_190
and the Chebyshev polynomials of the fourth kind are defined as:
formula_191
where formula_192. In the airfoil literature formula_193 and formula_194 are denoted formula_195 and formula_196. The polynomial families formula_1, formula_2, formula_193, and formula_194 are orthogonal with respect to the weights:
formula_201
and are proportional to Jacobi polynomials formula_155 with:
formula_203

All four families satisfy the recurrence formula_204 with formula_205, where formula_206, formula_5, formula_208, or formula_209, but they differ according to whether formula_210 equals formula_87, formula_212, formula_213, or 

=== Even order modified Chebyshev polynomials ===
Some applications rely on Chebyshev polynomials but may be unable to accommodate the lack of a root at zero, which rules out the use of standard Chebyshev polynomials for these kinds of applications. Even order Chebyshev filter designs using equally terminated passive networks are an example of this. However, even order Chebyshev polynomials may be modified to move the lowest roots down to zero while still maintaining the desirable Chebyshev equi-ripple effect. Such modified polynomials contain two roots at zero, and may be referred to as even order modified Chebyshev polynomials. Even order modified Chebyshev polynomials may be created from the Chebyshev nodes in the same manner as standard Chebyshev polynomials.
formula_214

where

* formula_215 is an &quot;N&quot;-th order Chebyshev polynomial
* formula_216 is the &quot;i&quot;-th Chebyshev node

In the case of even order modified Chebyshev polynomials, the even order modified Chebyshev nodes are used to construct the even order modified Chebyshev polynomials.
formula_217

where

* formula_218 is an &quot;N&quot;-th order even order modified Chebyshev polynomial
* formula_219 is the &quot;i&quot;-th even order modified Chebyshev node

For example, the 4th order Chebyshev polynomial from the example above is formula_220, which by inspection contains no roots of zero. Creating the polynomial from the even order modified Chebyshev nodes creates a 4th order even order modified Chebyshev polynomial of formula_221, which by inspection contains two roots at zero, and may be used in applications requiring roots at zero.

<text>GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid, γ-aminobutyric acid) is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the developmentally mature mammalian central nervous system. Its principal role is reducing neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system.

GABA is sold as a dietary supplement in many countries. It has been traditionally thought that exogenous GABA (i.e., taken as a supplement) does not cross the blood–brain barrier, but data obtained from more recent research (2010s) in rats describes the notion as being unclear.

The carboxylate form of GABA is γ-aminobutyrate.

== Function ==

=== Neurotransmitter ===
Two general classes of GABA receptor are known:
* GABAA in which the receptor is part of a ligand-gated ion channel complex
* GABAB metabotropic receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors that open or close ion channels via intermediaries (G proteins)

Neurons that produce GABA as their output are called GABAergic neurons, and have chiefly inhibitory action at receptors in the adult vertebrate. Medium spiny cells are a typical example of inhibitory central nervous system GABAergic cells. In contrast, GABA exhibits both excitatory and inhibitory actions in insects, mediating muscle activation at synapses between nerves and muscle cells, and also the stimulation of certain glands. In mammals, some GABAergic neurons, such as chandelier cells, are also able to excite their glutamatergic counterparts. In addition to fast-acting phasic inhibition, small amounts of extracellular GABA can induce slow timescale tonic inhibition on neurons. 

GABAA receptors are ligand-activated chloride channels: when activated by GABA, they allow the flow of chloride ions across the membrane of the cell. Whether this chloride flow is depolarizing (makes the voltage across the cell&#x27;s membrane less negative), shunting (has no effect on the cell&#x27;s membrane potential), or inhibitory/hyperpolarizing (makes the cell&#x27;s membrane more negative) depends on the direction of the flow of chloride. When net chloride flows out of the cell, GABA is depolarising; when chloride flows into the cell, GABA is inhibitory or hyperpolarizing. When the net flow of chloride is close to zero, the action of GABA is shunting. Shunting inhibition has no direct effect on the membrane potential of the cell; however, it reduces the effect of any coincident synaptic input by reducing the electrical resistance of the cell&#x27;s membrane. Shunting inhibition can &quot;override&quot; the excitatory effect of depolarising GABA, resulting in overall inhibition even if the membrane potential becomes less negative. It was thought that a developmental switch in the molecular machinery controlling the concentration of chloride inside the cell changes the functional role of GABA between neonatal and adult stages. As the brain develops into adulthood, GABA&#x27;s role changes from excitatory to inhibitory.

=== Brain development ===
GABA is an inhibitory transmitter in the mature brain; its actions were thought to be primarily excitatory in the developing brain. The gradient of chloride was reported to be reversed in immature neurons, with its reversal potential higher than the resting membrane potential of the cell; activation of a GABA-A receptor thus leads to efflux of Cl− ions from the cell (that is, a depolarizing current). The differential gradient of chloride in immature neurons was shown to be primarily due to the higher concentration of NKCC1 co-transporters relative to KCC2 co-transporters in immature cells. GABAergic interneurons mature faster in the hippocampus and the GABA machinery appears earlier than glutamatergic transmission. Thus, GABA is considered the major excitatory neurotransmitter in many regions of the brain before the maturation of glutamatergic synapses.

In the developmental stages preceding the formation of synaptic contacts, GABA is synthesized by neurons and acts both as an autocrine (acting on the same cell) and paracrine (acting on nearby cells) signalling mediator. The ganglionic eminences also contribute greatly to building up the GABAergic cortical cell population.

GABA regulates the proliferation of neural progenitor cells, the migration and differentiation the elongation of neurites and the formation of synapses.

GABA also regulates the growth of embryonic and neural stem cells. GABA can influence the development of neural progenitor cells via brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. GABA activates the GABAA receptor, causing cell cycle arrest in the S-phase, limiting growth.

=== Beyond the nervous system ===

Besides the nervous system, GABA is also produced at relatively high levels in the insulin-producing beta cells (β-cells) of the pancreas. The β-cells secrete GABA along with insulin and the GABA binds to GABA receptors on the neighboring islet alpha cells (α-cells) and inhibits them from secreting glucagon (which would counteract insulin&#x27;s effects).

GABA can promote the replication and survival of β-cells and also promote the conversion of α-cells to β-cells, which may lead to new treatments for diabetes.

Alongside GABAergic mechanisms, GABA has also been detected in other peripheral tissues including intestines, stomach, fallopian tubes, uterus, ovaries, testicles, kidneys, urinary bladder, the lungs and liver, albeit at much lower levels than in neurons or β-cells.

Experiments on mice have shown that hypothyroidism induced by fluoride poisoning can be halted by administering GABA. The test also found that the thyroid recovered naturally without further assistance after the fluoride had been expelled by the GABA.

Immune cells express receptors for GABA and administration of GABA can suppress inflammatory immune responses and promote &quot;regulatory&quot; immune responses, such that GABA administration has been shown to inhibit autoimmune diseases in several animal models.

In 2018, GABA has shown to regulate secretion of a greater number of cytokines. In plasma of T1D patients, levels of 26 cytokines are increased and of those, 16 are inhibited by GABA in the cell assays.

In 2007, an excitatory GABAergic system was described in the airway epithelium. The system is activated by exposure to allergens and may participate in the mechanisms of asthma. GABAergic systems have also been found in the testis and in the eye lens.

== Structure and conformation ==
GABA is found mostly as a zwitterion (i.e., with the carboxyl group deprotonated and the amino group protonated). Its conformation depends on its environment. In the gas phase, a highly folded conformation is strongly favored due to the electrostatic attraction between the two functional groups. The stabilization is about 50 kcal/mol, according to quantum chemistry calculations. In the solid state, an extended conformation is found, with a trans conformation at the amino end and a gauche conformation at the carboxyl end. This is due to the packing interactions with the neighboring molecules. In solution, five different conformations, some folded and some extended, are found as a result of solvation effects. The conformational flexibility of GABA is important for its biological function, as it has been found to bind to different receptors with different conformations. Many GABA analogues with pharmaceutical applications have more rigid structures in order to control the binding better.

== History ==
In 1883, GABA was first synthesized, and it was first known only as a plant and microbe metabolic product.

In 1950, Washington University School of Medicine researchers Eugene Roberts and Sam Frankel used newly-developed techniques of chromatography to analyze protein-free extracts of mammalian brain and discovered that GABA is produced from the glutamic acid and accumulates in the mammalian central nervous system.

There was not much further research into the substance until seven years later, Canadian researchers identified GABA as the mysterious component (termed Factor I by its discoverers in 1954) of brain and spinal cord extracts which inhibited crayfish neurons.

By 1959, it was shown that at an inhibitory synapse on crayfish muscle fibers GABA acts like stimulation of the inhibitory nerve. Both inhibition by nerve stimulation and by applied GABA are blocked by picrotoxin.

== Biosynthesis ==
GABA is primarily synthesized from glutamate via the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) with pyridoxal phosphate (the active form of vitamin B6) as a cofactor. This process converts glutamate (the principal excitatory neurotransmitter) into GABA (the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter).

GABA can also be synthesized from putrescine by diamine oxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase.

Historically it was thought that exogenous GABA did not penetrate the blood–brain barrier, but more current research describes the notion as being unclear pending further research.

== Metabolism ==
GABA transaminase enzymes catalyze the conversion of 4-aminobutanoic acid (GABA) and 2-oxoglutarate (α-ketoglutarate) into succinic semialdehyde and glutamate. Succinic semialdehyde is then oxidized into succinic acid by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and as such enters the citric acid cycle as a usable source of energy.

== Pharmacology ==
Drugs that act as allosteric modulators of GABA receptors (known as GABA analogues or &quot;GABAergic&quot; drugs), or increase the available amount of GABA, typically have relaxing, anti-anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects (with equivalent efficacy to lamotrigine based on studies of mice). Many of the substances below are known to cause anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia.

In general, GABA does not cross the blood–brain barrier, although certain areas of the brain that have no effective blood–brain barrier, such as the periventricular nucleus, can be reached by drugs such as systemically injected GABA. At least one study suggests that orally administered GABA increases the amount of human growth hormone (HGH). GABA directly injected to the brain has been reported to have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the production of growth hormone, depending on the physiology of the individual. Consequently, considering the potential biphasic effects of GABA on growth hormone production, as well as other safety concerns, its usage is not recommended during pregnancy and lactation.

GABA enhances the catabolism of serotonin into &quot;N&quot;-acetylserotonin (the precursor of melatonin) in rats. It is thus suspected that GABA is involved in the synthesis of melatonin and thus might exert regulatory effects on sleep and reproductive functions.

== Chemistry ==
Although in chemical terms, GABA is an amino acid (as it has both a primary amine and a carboxylic acid functional group), it is rarely referred to as such in the professional, scientific, or medical community. By convention the term &quot;amino acid&quot;, when used without a qualifier, refers specifically to an alpha amino acid. GABA is not an alpha amino acid, meaning the amino group is not attached to the alpha carbon. Nor is it incorporated into proteins as are many alpha-amino acids.

== GABAergic drugs ==
GABAA receptor ligands are shown in the following table.
GABAergic pro-drugs include chloral hydrate, which is metabolised to trichloroethanol, which then acts via the GABAA receptor.

The plant kava contains GABAergic compounds, including kavain, dihydrokavain, methysticin, dihydromethysticin and yangonin.
Other GABAergic modulators include:

*GABAB receptor ligands.
**Agonists: baclofen, propofol, GHB, phenibut.
**Antagonists: phaclofen, saclofen.
*GABA reuptake inhibitors: deramciclane, hyperforin, tiagabine.
*GABA transaminase inhibitors: gabaculine, phenelzine, valproate, vigabatrin, lemon balm (&quot;Melissa officinalis&quot;).
*GABA analogues: pregabalin, gabapentin, picamilon, progabide

4-Amino-1-butanol is a biochemical precursor of GABA and can be converted into GABA by the actions of aldehyde reductase (ALR) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) with γ-aminobutyraldehyde (GABAL) as a metabolic intermediate.

== In plants ==
GABA is also found in plants. It is the most abundant amino acid in the apoplast of tomatoes. Evidence also suggests a role in cell signalling in plants.

== Early life ==
Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann was born in Meissen, Saxony, near Dresden. His father Christian Gottfried Hahnemann was a painter and designer of porcelain, for which the town of Meissen is famous.

As a young man, Hahnemann became proficient in a number of languages, including English, French, Italian, Greek and Latin. He eventually made a living as a translator and teacher of languages, gaining further proficiency in &quot;Arabic, Syriac, Chaldaic and Hebrew&quot;.

Hahnemann studied medicine for two years at Leipzig. Citing Leipzig&#x27;s lack of clinical facilities, he moved to Vienna, where he studied for ten months. His medical professors in Leipzig and Vienna included the physician Joseph von Quarin, later credited for turning Vienna General Hospital into a model European medical institution.

After one term of further study, Hahnemann graduated with a medical degree with honors from the University of Erlangen on 10 August 1779. His poverty may have forced him to choose Erlangen, as the school&#x27;s fees were lower than in Vienna. Hahnemann&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;Conspectus adfectuum spasmodicorum aetiologicus et therapeuticus&quot; [&quot;A Dissertation on the Causes and Treatment of Spasmodic Diseases&quot;].

== Medical practice ==
In 1781, Hahnemann took a village doctor&#x27;s position in the copper-mining area of Mansfeld, Saxony. He soon married Johanna Henriette Kuchler and would eventually have eleven children. After abandoning medical practice, and while working as a translator of scientific and medical textbooks, he translated fifteen books from English, six from French and one each from Latin and Italian from 1777 to 1806. Hahnemann travelled around Saxony for many years, staying in many different towns and villages for varying lengths of time, never living far from the River Elbe and settling at different times in Dresden, Torgau, Leipzig and Köthen (Anhalt) before finally moving to Paris in June 1835.

===Creation of homeopathy===

Hahnemann was dissatisfied with the state of medicine in his time, and particularly objected to practices such as bloodletting. He claimed that the medicine he had been taught to practice sometimes did the patient more harm than good:
My sense of duty would not easily allow me to treat the unknown pathological state of my suffering brethren with these unknown medicines. The thought of becoming in this way a murderer or malefactor towards the life of my fellow human beings was most terrible to me, so terrible and disturbing that I wholly gave up my practice in the first years of my married life and occupied myself solely with chemistry and writing.

After giving up his practice around 1784, Hahnemann made his living chiefly as a writer and translator, while resolving also to investigate the causes of medicine&#x27;s alleged errors. While translating William Cullen&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise on the Materia Medica&quot;, Hahnemann encountered the claim that cinchona, the bark of a Peruvian tree, was effective in treating malaria because of its astringency. Hahnemann believed that other astringent substances are not effective against malaria and began to research cinchona&#x27;s effect on the human body by self-application. Noting that the drug induced malaria-like symptoms in himself, he concluded that it would do so in any healthy individual. This led him to postulate a healing principle: &quot;that which can produce a set of symptoms in a healthy individual, can treat a sick individual who is manifesting a similar set of symptoms.&quot; This principle, &quot;like cures like&quot;, became the basis for an approach to medicine which he gave the name homeopathy. He first used the term homeopathy in his essay &quot;Indications of the Homeopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice&quot;, published in Hufeland&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; in 1807.

=== Development of homeopathy ===
Following up the work of the Viennese physician Anton von Störck, Hahnemann tested substances for the effects they produced on a healthy individual, presupposing (as von Störck had claimed) that they may heal the same ills that they caused. His researches led him to agree with von Störck that the toxic effects of ingested substances are often broadly parallel to certain disease states, and his exploration of historical cases of poisoning in the medical literature further implied a more generalised medicinal &quot;law of similars&quot;. He later devised methods of diluting the drugs he was testing in order to mitigate their toxic effects. He claimed that these dilutions, when prepared according to his technique of &quot;potentization&quot; using dilution and succussion (vigorous shaking), were still effective in alleviating the same symptoms in the sick. His more systematic experiments with dose reduction really commenced around 1800–01 when, on the basis of his &quot;law of similars,&quot; he had begun using &quot;Ipecacuanha&quot; for the treatment of coughs and Belladonna for scarlet fever.

He first published an article about the homeopathic approach in a German-language medical journal in 1796. Following a series of further essays, he published in 1810 &quot;Organon of the Rational Art of Healing&quot;, followed over the years by four further editions entitled &quot;The Organon of the Healing Art&quot;, the first systematic treatise and containing all his detailed instructions on the subject. A 6th &quot;Organon&quot; edition, unpublished during his lifetime, and dating from February 1842, was only published many years after his death. It consisted of a 5th &quot;Organon&quot; containing extensive handwritten annotations. The &quot;Organon&quot; is widely regarded as a remodelled form of an essay he published in 1806 called &quot;The Medicine of Experience&quot;, which had been published in Hufeland&#x27;s Journal. Of the &quot;Organon&quot;, Robert Ellis Dudgeon states it &quot;was an amplification and extension of his &quot;Medicine of Experience&quot;, worked up with greater care, and put into a more methodical and aphoristic form, after the model of the Hippocratic writings.&quot;

=== Coffee theory of disease ===

Around the start of the nineteenth century Hahnemann developed a theory, propounded in his 1803 essay &quot;On the Effects of Coffee from Original Observations&quot;, that many diseases are caused by coffee. Hahnemann later abandoned the coffee theory in favour of the theory that disease is caused by &quot;Psora&quot;, but it has been noted that the list of conditions Hahnemann attributed to coffee was similar to his list of conditions caused by &quot;Psora&quot;.

== Later life ==
In early 1811 Hahnemann moved his family back to Leipzig with the intention of teaching his new medical system at the University of Leipzig. As required by the university statutes, to become a faculty member he was required to submit and defend a thesis on a medical topic of his choice. On 26 June 1812, Hahnemann presented a Latin thesis, entitled &quot;A Medical Historical Dissertation on the Helleborism of the Ancients.&quot; His thesis very thoroughly examined the historical literature and sought to differentiate between the ancient use of &quot;Helleborus niger&quot;, or black hellebore, and the medicinal uses of the &quot;white hellebore&quot;, botanically &quot;Veratrum album&quot;, both of which are poisonous plants.

Hahnemann continued practicing and researching homeopathy, as well as writing and lecturing for the rest of his life. He died in 1843 in Paris, at 88 years of age, and is entombed in a mausoleum at Paris&#x27;s Père Lachaise Cemetery.

== Descendants ==
Hahnemann&#x27;s daughter, Amelie (1789–1881), had a son: Leopold Suss-Hahnemann. Leopold emigrated to England, and he practised homeopathy in London. He retired to the Isle of Wight and died there at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Dr Leopold Suss-Hahnemann&#x27;s youngest daughter, Amalia, had two children, Winifred (born in 1898) and Herbert. William Herbert Tankard-Hahnemann (1922–2009) was Winifred&#x27;s son. He served as a Major in the British Army during World War II, and then had a career in the city of London. He was at one point appointed as a Freeman of the City of London. Mr William Herbert Tankard-Hahnemann, the great-great-great-grandson of Samuel Hahnemann died on 12 January 2009 (his 87th birthday) after 22 years of active patronage of the British Institute of Homeopathy. The William Tankard-Hahnemann line continues with his son, Charles.

== Writings ==
Hahnemann wrote a number of books, essays, and letters on the homeopathic method, chemistry, and general medicine:
* &quot;Heilkunde der Erfahrung.&quot; Norderstedt 2010, 
* reprinted in 
*&quot;Fragmenta de viribus medicamentorum positivis sive in sano corpore humano obeservitis&quot;, a collection of 27 drug &quot;provings&quot; published in Latin in 1805.
*&quot;The Organon of the Healing Art&quot; (1810), a detailed delineation of what he saw as the rationale underpinning homeopathic medicine, and guidelines for practice. Hahnemann published the 5th edition in 1833; a revised draft of this (1842) was discovered after Hahnemann&#x27;s death and finally published as the 6th edition in 1921.
*&quot;Materia Medica Pura&quot;, a compilation of &quot;homoeopathic proving&quot; reports, published in six volumes between vol. I in 1811 and vol. VI in 1821; second edition of vol. I to Vol. VI from 1822 to 1827 and third revised editions of volumes I and II were published in 1830 and 1833, respectively.
*&quot;Chronic Diseases&quot; (1828), an explanation of the root and cure of chronic disease according to the theory of miasms, together with a compilation of &quot;homoeopathic proving&quot; reports, published in five volumes during the 1830s.
* &quot;The Friend of Health&quot;, in which Hahnemann &quot;recommended the use of fresh air, bed rest, proper diet, sunshine, public hygiene and numerous other beneficial measures at a time when many other physicians considered them of no value.&quot;
* &quot;Appeal to Thinking Philanthropist Respecting the Mode of Propagation of the Asiatic Choler&quot;, in which Hahnemann describes cholera physicians and nurses as the &quot;certain and frequent propagators&quot; of cholera and that whilst deriding nurses&#x27; &quot;fumigations with chlorine&quot;, promoted the use of &quot;drops of camphorated spirit&quot; as a cure for the disease.
* Hahnemann also campaigned for the humane treatment of the insane in 1792.
* John Henry Clarke wrote that &quot;In 1787, Hahnemann discovered the best test for arsenic and other poisons in wine, having pointed out the unreliable nature of the &#x27;Wurtemberg test,&#x27; which had been in use up to that date.&quot;
* &quot;Samuel Hahnemanns Apothekerlexikon&quot;. Vol.2. Crusius, Leipzig 1798–1799 Digital edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf
* &quot;Reine Arzneimittellehre&quot;. Arnold, Dresden (several editions) 1822–1827 Digital edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf
* &quot;Systematische Darstellung der reinen Arzneiwirkungen aller bisher geprüften Mittel&quot;. Vieweg, Braunschweig 1831 – Digital edition by the University and State Library Düsseldorf

<doc id="184570" wikidata="Q2402635" url="?curid=184570" title="Microbotics">
<text>Microbotics (or microrobotics) is the field of miniature robotics, in particular mobile robots with characteristic dimensions less than 1 mm. The term can also be used for robots capable of handling micrometer size components.

==History==
Microbots were born thanks to the appearance of the microcontroller in the last decade of the 20th century, and the appearance of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) on silicon, although many microbots do not use silicon for mechanical components other than sensors. The earliest research and conceptual design of such small robots was conducted in the early 1970s in (then) classified research for U.S. intelligence agencies. Applications envisioned at that time included prisoner of war rescue assistance and electronic intercept missions. The underlying miniaturization support technologies were not fully developed at that time, so that progress in prototype development was not immediately forthcoming from this early set of calculations and concept design. As of 2008, the smallest microrobots use a scratch drive actuator.

The development of wireless connections, especially Wi-Fi (i.e. in household networks) has greatly increased the communication capacity of microbots, and consequently their ability to coordinate with other microbots to carry out more complex tasks. Indeed, much recent research has focused on microbot communication, including a 1,024 robot swarm at Harvard University that assembles itself into various shapes; and manufacturing microbots at SRI International for DARPA&#x27;s &quot;MicroFactory for Macro Products&quot; program that can build lightweight, high-strength structures.

Microbots called xenobots have also been built using biological tissues instead of metal and electronics. Xenobots avoid some of the technological and environmental complications of traditional microbots as they are self-powered, biodegradable, and biocompatible.

==Definitions==
While the &quot;micro&quot; prefix has been used subjectively to mean &quot;small&quot;, standardizing on length scales avoids confusion. Thus a nanorobot would have characteristic dimensions at or below 1 micrometer, or manipulate components on the 1 to 1000 nm size range. A microrobot would have characteristic dimensions less than 1 millimeter, a millirobot would have dimensions less than a cm, a mini-robot would have dimensions less than , and a small robot would have dimensions less than .

Many sources also describe robots larger than 1 millimeter as microbots or robots larger than 1 micrometer as nanobots. 

==Design considerations==

The way microrobots move around is a function of their purpose and necessary size. At submicron sizes, the physical world demands rather bizarre ways of getting around. The Reynolds number for airborne robots is less than unity; the viscous forces dominate the inertial forces, so “flying” could use the viscosity of air, rather than Bernoulli&#x27;s principle of lift. Robots moving through fluids may require rotating flagella like the motile form of E. coli. Hopping is stealthy and energy-efficient; it allows the robot to negotiate the surfaces of a variety of terrains. Pioneering calculations (Solem 1994) examined possible behaviors based on physical realities.

One of the major challenges in developing a microrobot is to achieve motion using a very limited power supply. The microrobots can use a small lightweight battery source like a coin cell or can scavenge power from the surrounding environment in the form of vibration or light energy. Microrobots are also now using biological motors as power sources, such as flagellated &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot;, to draw chemical power from the surrounding fluid to actuate the robotic device. These biorobots can be directly controlled by stimuli such as chemotaxis or galvanotaxis with several control schemes available. A popular alternative to an onboard battery is to power the robots using externally induced power. Examples include the use of electromagnetic fields, ultrasound and light to activate and control micro robots.

The 2022 study focused on a photo-biocatalytic approach for the &quot;design of light-driven microrobots with applications in microbiology and biomedicine&quot;.

== Locomotion of microrobots ==
Microrobots employ various locomotion methods to navigate through different environments, from solid surfaces to fluids. These methods are often inspired by biological systems and are designed to be effective at the micro-scale. Several factors need to be maximized (precision, speed, stability), and others have to be minimized (energy consumption, energy loss) in the design and operation of microrobot locomotion in order to guarantee accurate, effective, and efficient movement.

When describing the locomotion of microrobots, several key parameters are used to characterize and evaluate their movement, including stride length and transportation costs. A stride refers to a complete cycle of movement that includes all the steps or phases necessary for an organism or robot to move forward by repeating a specific sequence of actions. Stride length (𝞴s) is the distance covered by a microrobot in one complete cycle of its locomotion mechanism. Cost of transport (CoT) defines the work required to move a unit of mass of a microrobot a unit of distance 

=== Surface locomotion ===
Microrobots that use surface locomotion can move in a variety of ways, including walking, crawling, rolling, or jumping. These microrobots meet different challenges, such as gravity and friction. One of the parameters describing surface locomotion is the Frounde number, defined as:

formula_1

Where &quot;v&quot; is motion speed, g is the gravitational field, and 𝞴s is a stride length. A microrobot demonstrating a low Froude number moves slower and more stable as gravitational forces dominate, while a high Froude number indicates that inertial forces are more significant, allowing faster and potentially less stable movement.

Crawling is one of the most typical surface locomotion types. The mechanisms employed by microrobots for crawling can differ but usually include the synchronized movement of multiple legs or appendages. The mechanism of the microrobots&#x27; movements is often inspired by animals such as insects, reptiles, and small mammals. An example of a crawling microrobot is RoBeetle. The autonomous microrobot weighs 88 milligrams (approximately the weight of three rice grains). The robot is powered by the catalytic combustion of methanol. The design relies on controllable NiTi-Pt–based catalytic artificial micromuscles with a mechanical control mechanism.

Other options for actuating microrobots&#x27; surface locomotion include magnetic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, electrostatic, and optical actuation.

=== Swimming locomotion ===
Swimming microrobots are designed to operate in 3D through fluid environments, like biological fluids or water. To achieve effective movements, locomotion strategies are adopted from small aquatic animals or microorganisms, such as flagellar propulsion, pulling, chemical propulsion, jet propulsion, and tail undulation. Swimming microrobots, in order to move forward, must drive water backward.

Microrobots move in the low Reynolds number regime due to their small sizes and low operating speeds, as well as high viscosity of the fluids they navigate. At this level, viscous forces dominate over inertial forces. This requires a different approach in the design compared to swimming at the macroscale in order to achieve effective movements. The low Reynolds number also allows for accurate movements, which makes it good application in medicine, micro-manipulation tasks, and environmental monitoring.

Dominating viscous (Stokes) drag forces Tdrag on the robot balances the propulsive force Fp generated by a swimming mechanism.

 formula_2

Where b is the viscous drag coefficient, v is motion speed, and m is the body mass.

One of the examples of a swimming microrobot is a helical magnetic microrobot consisting of a spiral tail and a magnetic head body. This design is inspired by the flagellar motion of bacteria. By applying a magnetic torque to a helical microrobot within a low-intensity rotating magnetic field, the rotation can be transformed into linear motion. This conversion is highly effective in low Reynolds number environments due to the unique helical structure of the microrobot. By altering the external magnetic field, the direction of the spiral microrobot&#x27;s motion can be easily reversed.

=== At Air-Fluid Interface locomotion ===
In the specific instance when microrobots are at the air-fluid interface, they can take advantage of surface tension and forces provided by capillary motion. At the point where air and a liquid, most often water, come together, it is possible to establish an interface capable of supporting the weight of the microrobots through the work of surface tension. Cohesion between molecules of a liquid creates surface tension, which otherwise creates ‘skin’ over the water’s surface, letting the microrobots float instead of sinking. Through such concepts, microrobots could perform specific locomotion functions, including climbing, walking, levitating, floating, and or even jumping, by exploring the characteristics of the air-fluid interface.

Due to the surface tension ,σ, the buoyancy force, Fb, and the curvature force, Fc, play the most important roles, particularly in deciding whether the microrobot will float or sink on the surface of the liquid. This can be expressed as

formula_3

Fb is obtained by integrating the hydrostatic pressure over the area of the body in contact with the water. In contrast, Fc is obtained by integrating the curvature pressure over this area or, alternatively, the vertical component of the surface tension, formula_4, along the contact perimeter.

One example of a climbing, walking microrobot that utilizes air-fluid locomotion is the Harvard Ambulatory MicroRobot with Electroadhesion (HAMR-E). The control system of HAMR-E is developed to allow the robot to function in a flexible and maneuverable manner in a challenging environment. Its features include its ability to move on horizontal, vertical, and inverted planes, which is facilitated by the electro-adhesion system. This uses electric fields to create electrostatic attraction, causing the robot to stick and move on different surfaces. With four compliant and electro-adhesion footpads, HAMR-E can safely grasp and slide over various substrate types, including glass, wood, and metal. The robot has a slim body and is fully posable, making it easy to perform complex movements and balance on any surface.

=== Flying locomotion ===
Flying microrobots are miniature robotic systems meticulously engineered to operate in the air by emulating the flight mechanisms of insects and birds. These microrobots have to overcome the issues related to lift, thrust, and movement that are challenging to accomplish at such a small scale where most aerodynamic theories must be modified. Active flight is the most energy-intensive mode of locomotion, as the microrobot must lift its body weight while propelling itself forward. To achieve this function, these microrobots mimic the movement of insect wings and generate the necessary airflow for producing lift and thrust. Miniaturized wings of the robots are actuated with Piezoelectric materials, which offer better control of wing kinematics and flight dynamics.

To calculate the necessary aerodynamic power for maintaining a hover with flapping wings, the primary physical equation is expressed as

formula_5

where m is the body mass, L is the wing length, Φ represents the wing flapping amplitude in radians, ρ indicates the air density, and Vi corresponds to the induced air speed surrounding the body, a consequence of the wings&#x27; flapping and rotation movements. This equation illustrates that a small insect or robotic device must impart sufficient momentum to the surrounding air to counterbalance its own weight.

One example of a flying microrobot that utilizes flying locomotion is the RoboBee and DelFly Nimble, which, regarding flight dynamics, emulate bees and fruit flies, respectively. Harvard University invented the RoboBee, a miniature robot that mimics a bee fly, takes off and lands like one, and moves around confined spaces. It can be used in self-driving pollination and search operations for missing people and things. The DelFly Nimble, developed by the Delft University of Technology, is one of the most agile micro aerial vehicles that can mimic the maneuverability of a fruit fly by doing different tricks due to its minimal weight and advanced control mechanisms.

==Types and applications==
Due to their small size, microbots are potentially very cheap, and could be used in large numbers (swarm robotics) to explore environments which are too small or too dangerous for people or larger robots. It is expected that microbots will be useful in applications such as looking for survivors in collapsed buildings after an earthquake or crawling through the digestive tract. What microbots lack in brawn or computational power, they can make up for by using large numbers, as in swarms of microbots. Bioinspired microrobots have emerged as a game-changing tool in the quest for precise drug delivery. These microscopic robots are designed to navigate the human body with a degree of precision previously unimaginable.

Potential applications with demonstrated prototypes include:

===Medical microbots===

For example, there are biocompatible microalgae-based microrobots for active drug-delivery in the brain, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, and magnetically guided engineered bacterial microbots for &#x27;precision targeting&#x27; for fighting cancer that all have been tested with mice.

<text>A cartoonist is a visual artist who specializes in both drawing and writing cartoons (individual images) or comics (sequential images). Cartoonists differ from comics writers or comics illustrators/artists in that they produce both the literary and graphic components of the work as part of their practice.

Cartoonists may work in a variety of formats, including booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, webcomics, and video game packaging.

==Terminology==
A cartoonist&#x27;s discipline encompasses both authorial and drafting disciplines (see interdisciplinary arts). The terms &quot;comics illustrator&quot;, &quot;comics artist&quot;, or &quot;comic book artist&quot; refer to the picture-making portion of the discipline of cartooning (see illustrator). While every &quot;cartoonist&quot; might be considered a &quot;comics illustrator&quot;, &quot;comics artist&quot;, or a &quot;comic book artist&quot;, not every &quot;comics illustrator&quot;, &quot;comics artist&quot;, or a &quot;comic book artist&quot; is a &quot;cartoonist&quot;.

Ambiguity might arise when illustrators and writers share each other&#x27;s duties in authoring a work.

==History==

===Editorial cartoons===

The English satirist and editorial cartoonist William Hogarth, who emerged in the 18th century, poked fun at contemporary politics and customs; illustrations in such style are often referred to as &quot;Hogarthian&quot;. Following the work of Hogarth, editorial/political cartoons began to develop in England in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, calling the king (George III), prime ministers and generals to account, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.

====Origin in the U.S.====
While never a professional cartoonist, Benjamin Franklin is credited with the first cartoon published in &quot;The Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; on May 9, 1754: &quot;Join, or Die&quot;, depicting the American colonies as segments of a snake. In the 19th century, professional cartoonists such as Thomas Nast, whose work appeared in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, introduced other familiar American political symbols, such as the Republican elephant.
===Comic strips===
Comic strips received widespread distribution to mainstream newspapers by syndicates.

Calum MacKenzie, in his preface to the exhibition catalog, &quot;The Scottish Cartoonists&quot; (Glasgow Print Studio Gallery, 1979) defined the selection criteria: 
:The difference between a cartoonist and an illustrator was the same as the difference between a comedian and a comedy actor—the former both deliver their own lines and take full responsibility for them, the latter could always hide behind the fact that it was not his entire creation.

Many strips were the work of two people although only one signature was displayed. Shortly after Frank Willard began &quot;Moon Mullins&quot; in 1923, he hired Ferd Johnson as his assistant. For decades, Johnson received no credit. Willard and Johnson traveled about Florida, Maine, Los Angeles, and Mexico, drawing the strip while living in hotels, apartments and farmhouses. At its peak of popularity during the 1940s and 1950s, the strip ran in 350 newspapers. According to Johnson, he had been doing the strip solo for at least a decade before Willard&#x27;s death in 1958: &quot;They put my name on it then. I had been doing it about 10 years before that because Willard had heart attacks and strokes and all that stuff. The minute my name went on that thing and his name went off, 25 papers dropped the strip. That shows you that, although I had been doing it ten years, the name means a lot.&quot;

<doc id="184582" wikidata="Q1755472" url="?curid=184582" title="SBus">
<text>SBus is a computer bus system that was used in most SPARC-based computers (including all SPARCstations) from Sun Microsystems and others during the 1990s. It was introduced by Sun in 1989 to be a high-speed bus counterpart to their high-speed SPARC processors, replacing the earlier (and by this time, outdated) VMEbus used in their Motorola 68020- and 68030-based systems and early SPARC boxes. When Sun moved to open the SPARC definition in the early 1990s, SBus was likewise standardized and became IEEE-1496. In 1997 Sun started to migrate away from SBus to the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus, and today SBus is no longer used.

The industry&#x27;s first third-party SBus cards were announced in 1989 by Antares Microsystems; these were a 10BASE2 Ethernet controller, a SCSI-SNS host adapter, a parallel port, and an 8-channel serial controller.

The specification was published by Edward H. Frank and James D. Lyle.
A technical guide to the bus was published in 1992 in book form by Lyle, who founded Troubador Technologies. Sun also published a set of books as a &quot;developer&#x27;s kit&quot; to encourage third-party products.

At the peak of the market over 250 manufacturers were listed in the SBus Product Directory, which was renamed to the SPARC Product Directory in 1996.

SBus is in many ways a &quot;clean&quot; design. It was targeted only to be used with SPARC processors, so most cross-platform issues were not a consideration. SBus is based on a big-endian 32-bit address and data bus, can run at speeds ranging from 16.67 MHz to 25 MHz, and is capable of transferring up to 100 MB/s. Devices are each mapped onto a 28-bit address space (256 MB). Only eight masters are supported, although there can be an unlimited number of slaves.

When the 64-bit UltraSPARC was introduced, SBus was modified to support extended transfers of a 64 bits doubleword per cycle to produce a 200 MB/s 64-bit bus. This variant of the SBus architecture used the same form factor and was backward-compatible with existing devices, as extended transfers are an optional feature.

SBus cards had a very compact form factor for the time. A single-width card was wide by long and is designed to be mounted parallel to the motherboard. This allowed for three expansion slots in the slim &quot;pizza box&quot; enclosure of the SPARCstation 1. The design also allows for double- or triple-width cards that take up two or three slots, as well as double-height (two 3x5 inch boards mounted in a &quot;sandwich&quot; configuration) cards.

SBus was originally announced as both a system bus and a peripheral interconnect that allowed input and output devices relatively low latency access to memory. However, soon memory and central processing unit (CPU) speeds outpaced I/O performance. Within a year some Sun systems used MBus, another interconnection standard, as a CPU—memory bus. The SBus served as an input/output bus for the rest of its lifetime.

<doc id="184583" wikidata="Q1028485" url="?curid=184583" title="Lignum vitae">
<text>Lignum vitae (), also called guayacan or guaiacum, and in parts of Europe known as Pockholz or pokhout, is a wood from trees of the genus &quot;Guaiacum&quot;. The trees are indigenous to the Caribbean and the northern coast of South America (e.g., Colombia and Venezuela) and have been an important export crop to Europe since the beginning of the 16th century. The wood was once very important for applications requiring a material with its extraordinary combination of strength, toughness, and density. It is also the national tree of the Bahamas, and the Jamaican national flower. 

The wood is obtained chiefly from &quot;Guaiacum officinale&quot; and &quot;Guaiacum sanctum&quot;, both small, slow-growing trees. All species of the genus &quot;Guaiacum&quot; are now listed in Appendix II of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) as potentially endangered species. &quot;G. sanctum&quot; is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. Demand for the wood has been reduced by modern materials science, which has led to polymers, alloys and composite materials that can take lignum vitae&#x27;s place.

Various other hardwoods may also be called lignum vitae and should not be confused with it. The best-known come from &quot;Bulnesia arborea&quot; and &quot;Bulnesia sarmientoi&quot; (in the same subfamily as &quot;Guaiacum&quot;) and are known as verawood or Argentine lignum vitae; they are somewhat similar in appearance and working qualities as genuine lignum vitae. Note that these species are now &quot;Plectrocarpa arborea&quot; and &quot;Plectrocarpa sarmientoi&quot;. Some hardwoods from Australasia (e.g., &quot;Vitex lignum-vitae&quot; and some species of &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;) are also referred to as lignum vitae.

==Name==
&quot;Lignum vitae&quot; is Latin for &quot;wood of life&quot;. The plant derives its name from its medicinal uses; lignum vitae resin has been used to treat a variety of medical conditions from coughs to arthritis. 

Other names for lignum vitae include palo santo (Spanish for &quot;holy stick&quot;), Aura palo santo and &quot;bastard greenheart&quot; (not to be confused with true greenheart &quot;Chlorocardium rodiei&quot;, a popular wood in shipbuilding, cabinetry, and woodturning but a completely different timber). Lignum vitae is also one of the numerous hard, dense woods loosely referred to as &quot;ironwood&quot;.

==Description==
The tree is slow-growing and relatively small in stature, even when mature and old. It bears small, purplish-blue flowers which result in paired orange dehiscent fruits. The bark is mottled.

===Wood products===
Lignum vitae is hard and durable, and is also the densest wood traded (average dried density: ~79 lb/ft3 or ~1,260 kg/m3); it will easily sink in water. On the Janka scale of hardness, which measures hardness of woods, lignum vitae ranks highest of the trade woods, with a Janka hardness of 4,390 lbf (compared with Olneya at 3,260 lbf, African blackwood at 2,940 lbf, hickory at 1,820 lbf, red oak at 1,290 lbf, yellow pine at 690 lbf, and balsa at 100 lbf). The densest of all woods is &quot;Allocasuarina luehmannii&quot;. Krugiodendron typically has a higher density, among many other woods that vary by sample.

==Uses==
Because of the density of the wood, cricket bails, in particular &quot;heavy bails&quot; used in windy conditions, are sometimes made of lignum vitae. It is also sometimes used to make lawn bowls, croquet mallets, and skittles balls. The wood also has seen widespread historical usage in mortars and pestles and for wood carvers&#x27; mallets.

It was the traditional wood used for the British police truncheon until recently because of both its density and its strength, combined with its relative softness compared to metal, thereby tending to bruise rather than cut the skin.

The belaying pins and deadeyes aboard USS &quot;Constitution&quot; and many other sailing ships were made from lignum vitae. Due to its density and natural oils, they rarely require replacement, despite the severity of typical marine weathering conditions, and also resist jamming in their mortise holes. The sheaves of blocks on sailing vessels were made of lignum vitae until the introduction of modern synthetics.

Lignum vitae&#x27;s toughness also allows its use as a lap in the process of cutting gems. The wood is covered with powdered industrial diamond, attached to a spindle, and used to smooth rough surfaces of gems.

Master clockmaker John Harrison used lignum vitae in the bearings and gears of his pendulum clocks and his first three marine chronometers (all of which were large clocks rather than watches), for the wood is self-lubricating. The use of lignum vitae eliminates the need for horological lubricating oil; 18th-century horological oil would become viscous and reduce the accuracy of a timepiece under unfavourable conditions (including those that prevail at sea).

For the same reason it was widely used in water-lubricated shaft bearings for ships and hydro-electric power plants and in the stern-tube bearings of ship propeller shafts until the 1960s saw the introduction of sealed white metal bearings. According to the San Francisco Maritime National Park Association website, the shaft bearings on the WWII submarine were made of this wood. The aft main shaft strut bearings for , the world&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, were composed of this wood. Also, the bearings in the original 1920s turbines of the Conowingo hydroelectric plant on the lower Susquehanna River were made from lignum vitae. The shaft bearings on the horizontal turbines at the Pointe du Bois generating station in Manitoba are made from lignum vitae. Other hydroelectric plant turbine bearings, many of them still in service, were fabricated with lignum vitae and are too numerous to be listed here.

The United Railroads of San Francisco (an ancestor of the San Francisco Municipal Railway) began installing insulators made of composite materials to support the heavy 600-volt DC feeder wires for their trolley system in 1904. These lines were damaged, along with most everything else, during the 1906 earthquake and the fires that followed. Rebuilding the trolley system and expanding it to replace cable car routes destroyed in the quake created a huge demand for insulators, a demand manufacturers further east were unable to meet. The properties of lignum vitae, namely its ability to withstand high stress (from heavy cables on long spans and the strain of lines rounding corners) and high temperature (from the feeder cables&#x27; becoming very hot during peak operating hours), and its ready availability from the holds of the ships in the harbor (where it served as dunnage and ballast) made it an ideal &quot;temporary&quot; solution. Many were still in use well into the 1970s, and the final few were replaced with underground feeder systems in the 2000s.

It was also used extensively in the manufacture of British Railways Mark 1 rolling stock, as a &quot;bump stop&quot; in the bogies (the frame that carries the wheels).

==In popular culture==

Pioneering calypsonian/vaudevillian Sam Manning recorded a song titled &quot;Lignum Vitae&quot; in the 1920s.

Benvenuto Cellini recounts using lignum vitae, presumably decocted, to cure himself of a venereal disease, the &quot;French Pox&quot;, presumably syphilis.

According to T. H. White&#x27;s version of the Arthurian legend, &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, Merlin&#x27;s wand is made of lignum vitae and has magical powers.

Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s novel &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; includes a bathtub made of this wood in one of the main characters&#x27; homes. His novel &quot;Chronicle of a Death Foretold&quot; also refers to the use of this wood in making a cane for the blind Poncio Vicario.

American folksinger Pete Seeger fashioned the neck of his trademark banjo from lignum vitae.

In Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Bleak House&quot;, one of the characters, Matthew Bagnet is referred to as lignum vitae, &quot;in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy.&quot;

In Philip Pullman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Secret Commonwealth&quot;, the heroine Lyra Belacqua carries a truncheon made from lignum vitae as a weapon.

In &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Shadowbringers&quot;, lignum vitae logs are a crafting material commonly used by carpenters.

<text>Philidor (&quot;Filidor&quot;) or Danican Philidor was a family of musicians that served as court musicians to the French kings. The original name of the family was Danican (D&#x27;Anican) and was of Scottish origin (Duncan). Philidor was a later addition to the family name, given first to Michel the elder by Louis XIII because his oboe playing reminded the king of an Italian virtuoso oboist named Filidori. Both Michel the younger and Jean played in the Grande Écurie (literally, the Great Stable; figuratively, the Military Band) in Paris. Later members of the family were known as composers as well. One of them (François-André Danican Philidor) was a chess master.

* Michel Danican Philidor the elder (1580–1651)
** Michel Danican Philidor the younger (c. 1610–1659) was a renowned oboist and, together with Jean Hotteterre, co-invented the oboe by modifying the shawm so that the bore was narrower and the reed could be held near the end by the player&#x27;s lips
** Jean Danican Philidor (c. 1620–1679), the first whose name appears as &quot;Danican dit Philidor&quot;, father of the next generation
*** André Danican Philidor (André I, &quot;l&#x27;aîné&quot;) (c. 1652–1730), son of Jean, composer of the &quot;Marche française (Marche royale)&quot; (1679)
**** François Danican Philidor (c. 1680–1730), son of André l&#x27;aîné, half brother of Anne
**** Anne Danican Philidor (1681–1728), son of André, founder of a series of public concerts
**** Michel Danican Philidor III (1683–1723), son of André
**** François-André Danican Philidor (André II) (1726–1795), very late son of André; opera composer (notably &quot;Tom Jones&quot;), and the strongest chess master in the 18th century. He is considered by many to be one of the strongest players in chess history. His name is renowned among all chess players and there are two important chess terms named for his innovations:
***** the Philidor defence, an opening
***** the Philidor position, an endgame position
* Jacques Danican Philidor (known as &quot;le cadet&quot;, being the younger brother of Philidor the Elder) (1657–1708), son of Jean, composer of the &quot;Marche à quatre timbales pour le Carrousel de Monseigneur&quot; (1685)
** Pierre Danican Philidor (1681–1731), son of Jacques le cadet, also a musician

<doc id="184587" wikidata="Q1451159" url="?curid=184587" title="Orgy (band)">
<text>Orgy is an American industrial rock band formed in 1997, from Los Angeles, California. They have described their music as &quot;death pop&quot;. The band is best known for their cover version of the New Order song &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, and their original song &quot;Stitches&quot;, both from their 1998 album &quot;Candyass&quot;. Then they released their second album, &quot;Vapor Transmission&quot;, which was released in 2000, with &quot;Fiction (Dreams in Digital)&quot; and &quot;Opticon&quot; as singles.

==History==
===Early years (1997)===
Orgy was formed in 1997 by vocalist Jay Gordon and guitarists Amir Derakh and Ryan Shuck. Bassist Paige Haley and drummer Bobby Hewitt soon completed the line-up. Derakh had previously gained some fame in the 1980s metal band Rough Cutt, and Hewitt was a former member of Electric Love Hogs. Gordon played bass in Deadsy due to the lack of a bass player, on their unreleased self-tilted album, splitting roles with his friend and the lead singer, Elijah Blue Allman. He then left Deadsy, to form Orgy. Gordon and Derakh were also experienced producers, having produced Coal Chamber&#x27;s self-titled album.

In 1997, Jonathan Davis, who performed with Shuck in Sexart, signed Orgy as the first act on Korn&#x27;s label, Elementree Records, which at the time had distribution with Reprise Records.

===&quot;Candyass&quot; and &quot;Vapor Transmission&quot; (1998–2001)===
In 1998, Orgy released their debut album, &quot;Candyass&quot;, the name inspired by a drag queen they had met. The album sold almost two million copies and produced two singles: a cover of the New Order song &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, and &quot;Stitches&quot;. Both charted on &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. The song &quot;Revival&quot; featured Jonathan Davis.

Orgy made their live debut at EdgeFest, an annual radio show in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1998. They also appeared on the Family Values Tour with Korn, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, Incubus, and Rammstein. They were featured on the live compilation album of the tour, released in 1999. Other tours with Love and Rockets and Sugar Ray followed.

Their second album, the science fiction-themed &quot;Vapor Transmission&quot;, was released in 2000, with &quot;Fiction (Dreams in Digital)&quot; and &quot;Opticon&quot; as singles.

===Side work and &quot;Punk Statik Paranoia&quot; (2001–2005)===
In 2001, Orgy released the song &quot;Faces&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Zoolander&quot;. The band was a musical guest in the television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, performing &quot;Opticon&quot; in the episode &quot;Sin Francisco&quot;.

In late 2003, guitarists Shuck and Derakh formed a side project, Julien-K, as an outlet for electronic material they had come up with during the writing process for Orgy. Jay Gordon also remixed the Linkin Park track &quot;Points of Authority&quot; for their album &quot;Reanimation&quot;, where it was renamed &quot;Pts.of.Athrty&quot;.

After touring in support of &quot;Vapor Transmission&quot;, Orgy began working on a new album and a live DVD in mid to late 2002, but both of these were pushed back to mid 2003. Eventually, the band left Reprise Records and Elementree, taking the band&#x27;s already recorded material with them. Explaining the split from the label in an interview to PopGurls.com:&quot;We just couldn&#x27;t get it together with them to get the record going and they weren&#x27;t dropping us. So we finally managed to get let out of our contract and got the stuff that we had already recorded.&quot; -Amir Derakh in 2003, Jay Gordon and his father, Lou, started his own independent record label, D1 Music, and the label finally released the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Punk Statik Paranoia&quot;, in February 2004. The long-awaited live DVD, &quot;Trans Global Spectacle&quot;, was released in August 2005.

Following touring in support of &quot;Punk Statik Paranoia&quot;, the band went on hiatus in late 2005.

===Hiatus (2005–2012)===
When asked for an Orgy update in late July 2008, Shuck informed fans that Orgy&#x27;s return is still underway but their priority is getting the much delayed Julien-K album released. During a video interview at the NAMM Show in 2009, Derakh mentioned a 2010 Orgy reunion.

Shuck and Derakh released their first album as Julien-K, titled &quot;Death to Analog&quot;, in March 2009. In the same year, they also released an album with Chester Bennington of Linkin Park under the name Dead by Sunrise.

On October 25, 2010, Ryan Shuck and Amir Derakh stated on the Julien-K blog: &quot;As of Oct. 26th we will no longer be part of Orgy. Jay will continue making music without the original members.&quot;

On October 30, 2010, Jay Gordon released a statement via his official Facebook profile stating that he still owns the Orgy name and wants to continue forth creating new material for the band. Gordon wrote that all previous members of the band were too busy with numerous side projects to continue with the original band. &quot;Everyone has been so busy with their different projects I figured this was the only way for me to continue on with the name. I started this band, and I don&#x27;t want to let it fall to the wayside completely.&quot;

On November 7, 2011, Blabbermouth.net published a news story detailing the bitter feud between Gordon and guitarists Shuck and Derakh, that had spiraled out of control after Gordon revealed his plans to assemble a band of musicians and begin touring under the name Orgy.

===Return with new lineup (2012–present)===
On February 3, 2012, it was announced that Orgy would embark on a five-week run titled the &quot;Bad Blood Tour&quot;. Gordon was the only original member of Orgy appearing on this tour.

On August 4, 2012, Orgy linked to a 30-second demo of a new song, &quot;Grime of the Century&quot;, via their Twitter and Facebook page. The song &quot;Grime of the Century&quot; was later made available on iTunes and the new Orgy website.

In 2013, Orgy embarked on the &quot;Wide Awake and Dead Tour&quot; with Vampires Everywhere! and Davey Suicide.

Orgy launched a crowdfunding campaign in August 2013 via Indiegogo.com with a $100,000 goal. Two months later, at the conclusion of the campaign, the band had only raised $8,739, falling 92% short of their goal.

On February 23, 2014, the band announced through their official website that the new single &quot;Wide Awake and Dead&quot; will be available through iTunes and Amazon on March 18, 2014. The &quot;Wide Awake and Dead&quot; video was filmed on April 22.

In 2015, they released their first collection of new music in 11 years, an EP titled &quot;Talk Sick&quot;. Originally, it was to be followed with another EP titled &quot;Entropy&quot;, but Gordon later told &quot;Westword Magazine&quot; the band would instead release it as a full-length album, that has yet to materialize.

The band performed at the 2023 edition of the Sick New World festival; their appearance drew criticism as the band appeared to heavily use playback instead of a live performance.

<doc id="184588" wikidata="Q650553" url="?curid=184588" title="PIC microcontrollers">
<text>PIC (usually pronounced as /pɪk/) is a family of microcontrollers made by Microchip Technology, derived from the PIC1640 originally developed by General Instrument&#x27;s Microelectronics Division. The name PIC initially referred to &quot;Peripheral Interface Controller&quot;, and was subsequently expanded for a short time to include &quot;Programmable Intelligent Computer&quot;, though the name PIC is no longer used as an acronym for any term. 
The first parts of the family were available in 1976; by 2013 the company had shipped more than twelve billion individual parts, used in a wide variety of embedded systems.

The PIC was originally designed as a peripheral for the General Instrument CP1600, the first commercially available single-chip 16-bit microprocessor. To limit the number of pins required, the CP1600 had a complex highly-multiplexed bus which was difficult to interface with, so in addition to a variety of special-purpose peripherals, General Instrument made the programmable PIC1640 as an all-purpose peripheral. With its own small RAM, ROM and a simple CPU for controlling the transfers, it could connect the CP1600 bus to virtually any existing 8-bit peripheral. While this offered considerable power, GI&#x27;s marketing was limited and the CP1600 was not a success. However, GI had also made the PIC1650, a standalone PIC1640 with additional general-purpose I/O in place of the CP1600 interface. When the company spun off their chip division to form Microchip in 1985, sales of the CP1600 were all but dead, but the PIC1650 and successors had formed a major market of their own, and they became one of the new company&#x27;s primary products.

Early models only had mask ROM for code storage, but with its spinoff it was soon upgraded to use EPROM and then EEPROM, which made it possible for end-users to program the devices in their own facilities. All current models use flash memory for program storage, and newer models allow the PIC to reprogram itself. Since then the line has seen significant change; memory is now available in 8-bit, 16-bit, and, in latest models, 32-bit wide. Program instructions vary in bit-count by family of PIC, and may be 12, 14, 16, or 24 bits long. The instruction set also varies by model, with more powerful chips adding instructions for digital signal processing functions. The hardware implementations of PIC devices range from 6-pin SMD, 8-pin DIP chips up to 144-pin SMD chips, with discrete I/O pins, ADC and DAC modules, and communications ports such as UART, I2C, CAN, and even USB. Low-power and high-speed variations exist for many types.

The manufacturer supplies computer software for development known as MPLAB X, assemblers and C/C++ compilers, and programmer/debugger hardware under the MPLAB and PICKit series. Third party and some open-source tools are also available. Some parts have in-circuit programming capability; low-cost development programmers are available as well as high-volume production programmers.

PIC devices are popular with both industrial developers and hobbyists due to their low cost, wide availability, large user base, an extensive collection of application notes, availability of low cost or free development tools, serial programming, and re-programmable flash-memory capability.

==History==
===Original concept===

The original PIC was intended to be used with General Instrument&#x27;s new CP1600 16-bit central processing unit (CPU). In order to fit 16-bit data and address buses into a then-standard 40-pin dual inline package (DIP) chip, the two buses shared the same set of 16 connection pins. In order to communicate with the CPU, devices had to watch other pins on the CPU to determine if the information on the bus was an address or data. Since only one of these was being presented at a time, the devices had to watch the bus to go into address mode, see if that address was part of its memory mapped input/output range, &quot;latch&quot; that address and then wait for the data mode to turn on and then read the value. Additionally, the CP1600 used several external pins to select which device it was attempting to talk to, further complicating the interfacing.

As interfacing devices to the CP1600 could be complex, GI also released the 164x series of support chips with all of the required circuitry built-in. These included keyboard drivers, cassette deck interfaces for storage, and a host of similar systems. For more complex systems, GI introduced the 1640 &quot;Programmable Interface Controller&quot; in 1975. The idea was that a device would use the PIC to handle all the interfacing with the host computer&#x27;s CP1600, but also use its own internal processor to handle the actual device it was connected to. For instance, a floppy disk drive could be implemented with a PIC talking to the CPU on one side and the floppy disk controller on the other. In keeping with this idea, what would today be known as a microcontroller, the PIC included a small amount of read-only memory (ROM) that would be written with the user&#x27;s device controller code, and a separate random access memory (RAM) for buffering and working with data. These were connected separately, making the PIC a Harvard architecture system with code and data being stored and managed on separate internal pathways.

In theory, the combination of CP1600 CPU and PIC1640 device controllers provided a very high-performance device control system, one that was similar in power and performance to the channel I/O controllers seen on mainframe computers. In the floppy controller example, for instance, a single PIC could control the drive, provide a reasonable amount of buffering to improve performance, and then transfer data to and from the host computer using direct memory access (DMA) or through relatively simple code in the CPU. The downside to this approach was cost; while the PIC was not necessary for low-speed devices like a keyboard, many tasks would require one or more PICs to build out a complete system.

While the design concept had a number of attractive features, General Instrument never strongly marketed the CP1600, preferring to deal only with large customers and ignoring the low-end market. This resulted in very little uptake of the system, with the Intellivision being the only really widespread use with about three million units. However, GI had introduced a standalone model PIC1650 in 1976, designed for use without a CP1600. Although not as powerful as the Intel MCS-48 introduced the same year, it was cheaper, and it found a market. Follow-ons included the PIC1670, with instructions widened from 12 to 13 bits to provide twice the address space (64 bytes of RAM and 1024 words of ROM). When GI spun off its chip division to form Microchip Technology in 1985, production of the CP1600 ended. By this time, however, the PIC1650 had developed a large market of customers using it for a wide variety of roles, and the PIC went on to become one of the new company&#x27;s primary products.

===After the CP1600===

In 1985, General Instrument sold their microelectronics division and the new owners cancelled almost everything which by this time was mostly out-of-date. The PIC, however, was upgraded with an internal EPROM to produce a programmable channel I/O controller.
At the same time Plessey in the UK released NMOS processors numbered PIC1650 and PIC1655 based on the GI design, using the same instruction sets, either user mask programmable or versions pre-programmed for auto-diallers and keyboard interfaces.

In 1998 Microchip introduced the PIC16F84, a flash programmable and erasable version of its successful serial programmable PIC16C84.
In 2001, Microchip introduced more flash programmable devices, with full production commencing in 2002.

Today, a huge variety of PICs are available with various on-board peripherals (serial communication modules, UARTs, motor control kernels, etc.) and program memory from 256 words to 64K words and more. A &quot;word&quot; is one assembly language instruction, varying in length from 8 to 16 bits, depending on the specific PIC microcontroller series.

While PIC and PICmicro are now registered trademarks of Microchip Technology, the prefix ″PIC″ is no longer used as an acronym for any term. It is generally thought that PIC stands for &quot;Programmable Intelligent Computer&quot;, General Instruments&#x27; prefix in 1977 for the PIC1640 and PIC1650 family of microcomputers, replacing the 1976 original meaning &quot;Programmable Interface Controller&quot; for the PIC1640 that was designed specifically to work in combination with the CP1600 microcomputer. The &quot;PIC Series Microcomputers&quot; by General Instrument were a series of Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Large-Scale Integration (MOS/LSI) 8-bit microcomputers containing ROM, RAM, a CPU, and 8-bit input/output (I/O) registers for interfacing. At its time, this technology combined the advantages of MOS circuits with Large-Scale Integration, allowing for the creation of complex integrated circuits with high transistor density. 

The Microchip 16C84 (PIC16x84), introduced in 1993, was the first Microchip CPU with on-chip EEPROM memory.

By 2013, Microchip was shipping over one billion PIC microcontrollers every year.

==Device families==
PIC micro chips are designed with a Harvard architecture, and are offered in various device families. The baseline and mid-range families use 8-bit wide data memory, and the high-end families use 16-bit data memory. The latest series, PIC32MZ, is a 32-bit MIPS-based microcontroller. Instruction word sizes are 12 bits (PIC10 and PIC12), 14 bits (PIC16) and 24 bits (PIC24 and dsPIC). The binary representations of the machine instructions vary by family and are shown in PIC instruction listings.

Within these families, devices may be designated PICnnCxxx (CMOS) or PICnnFxxx (Flash). &quot;C&quot; devices are generally classified as &quot;Not suitable for new development&quot; (not actively promoted by Microchip). The program memory of &quot;C&quot; devices is variously described as OTP, ROM, or EEPROM. As of October 2016, the only OTP product classified as &quot;In production&quot; is the pic16HV540. &quot;C&quot; devices with quartz windows (for UV erasure) are in general no longer available.

===PIC10 and PIC12===

These devices feature a 12-bit wide code memory, a 32-byte register file, and a tiny two level deep call stack. They are represented by the PIC10 series, as well as by some PIC12 and PIC16 devices. Baseline devices are available in 6-pin to 40-pin packages.

Generally the first 7 to 9 bytes of the register file are special-purpose registers, and the remaining bytes are general purpose RAM. Pointers are implemented using a register pair: after writing an address to the FSR (file select register), the INDF (indirect f) register becomes an alias for the addressed register. If banked RAM is implemented, the bank number is selected by the high 3 bits of the FSR. This affects register numbers 16–31; registers 0–15 are global and not affected by the bank select bits.

Because of the very limited register space (5 bits), 4 rarely read registers were not assigned addresses, but written by special instructions (codice_1 and codice_2).

The ROM address space is 512 and may only specify addresses in the first half of each 512-word page. That is, the CALL instruction specifies the low 9 bits of the address, but only the low 8 bits of that address are a parameter of the instruction, while the 9th bit (bit 8) is implicitly specified as 0 by the CALL instruction itself.

Lookup tables are implemented using a computed codice_3 (assignment to PCL register) into a table of codice_4 instructions. RETLW performs a subroutine return and simultaneously loads the W register with an 8-bit immediate constant that is part of the instruction.

This &quot;baseline core&quot; does &quot;not&quot; support interrupts; all I/O must be polled. There are some &quot;enhanced baseline&quot; variants with interrupt support and a four-level call stack.

PIC10F32x devices feature a mid-range 14-bit wide code memory of 256 or 512 words, a 64-byte SRAM register file, and an 8-level deep hardware stack. These devices are available in 6-pin SMD and 8-pin DIP packages (with two pins unused). One input only and three I/O pins are available. A complex set of interrupts are available. Clocks are an internal calibrated high-frequency oscillator of 16 MHz with a choice of selectable speeds via software and a 31 kHz low-power source.

===PIC16===

These devices feature a 14-bit wide code memory, and an improved 8-level deep call stack. The instruction set differs very little from the baseline devices, but the two additional opcode bits allow 128 registers and 2048 words of code to be directly addressed. There are a few additional miscellaneous instructions, and two additional 8-bit literal instructions, add and subtract. The mid-range core is available in the majority of devices labeled PIC12 and PIC16.

The first 32 bytes of the register space are allocated to special-purpose registers; the remaining 96 bytes are used for general-purpose RAM. If banked RAM is used, the high 16 registers (0x70–0x7F) are global, as are a few of the most important special-purpose registers, including the STATUS register, which holds the RAM bank select bits. (The other global registers are FSR and INDF, the low 8 bits of the program counter PCL, the PC high preload register PCLATH, and the master interrupt control register INTCON.)

The PCLATH register supplies high-order instruction address bits when the 8 bits supplied by a write to the PCL register, or the 11 bits supplied by a codice_3 or codice_6 instruction, are not sufficient to address the available ROM space.

===PIC17===
The PIC17 series never became popular and has been superseded by the PIC18 architecture (however, see clones below). The PIC17 series is not recommended for new designs, and availability may be limited to users.

Improvements over earlier cores are 16-bit wide opcodes (allowing many new instructions), and a 16-level deep call stack. PIC17 devices were produced in packages from 40 to 68 pins.

The PIC17 series introduced a number of important new features:

* a memory mapped accumulator
* read access to code memory (table reads)
* direct register-to-register moves (prior cores needed to move registers through the accumulator)
* an external program memory interface to expand the code space
* an 8-bit × 8-bit hardware multiplier
* a second indirect register pair
* auto-increment/auto-decrement addressing controlled by control bits in a status register (ALUSTA)

A significant limitation was that RAM space was limited to 256 bytes (26 bytes of special function registers, and 232 bytes of general-purpose RAM), with awkward bank-switching in the models that supported more.

===PIC18===

In 2000, Microchip introduced the PIC18 architecture. Unlike the PIC17 series, it has proven to be very popular, with a large number of device variants presently in manufacture. In contrast to earlier devices, which were more often than not programmed in assembly language, C has become the predominant development language.

The PIC18 series inherits most of the features and instructions of the PIC17 series, while adding a number of important new features:

* call stack is 21 bits wide and much deeper (31 levels deep)
* the call stack may be read and written (TOSU:TOSH:TOSL registers)
* conditional branch instructions
* indexed addressing mode (PLUSW)
* the FSR registers are extended to 12 bits, allowing them to linearly address the entire data address space
* the addition of another FSR register (bringing the number up to 3)

The RAM space is 12 bits, addressed using a 4-bit bank select register (BSR) and an 8-bit offset in each instruction. An additional &quot;access&quot; bit in each instruction selects between bank 0 (&quot;a&quot;=0) and the bank selected by the BSR (&quot;a&quot;=1).

A 1-level stack is also available for the STATUS, WREG and BSR registers. They are saved on every interrupt, and may be restored on return. If interrupts are disabled, they may also be used on subroutine call/return by setting the &quot;s&quot; bit (appending &quot;, FAST&quot; to the instruction).

The auto increment/decrement feature was improved by removing the control bits and adding four new indirect registers per FSR. Depending on which indirect file register is being accessed, it is possible to postdecrement, postincrement, or preincrement FSR; or form the effective address by adding W to FSR.

In more advanced PIC18 devices, an &quot;extended mode&quot; is available which makes the addressing even more favorable to compiled code:

* a new offset addressing mode; some addresses which were relative to the access bank are now interpreted relative to the FSR2 register
* the addition of several new instructions, notably for manipulating the FSR registers.

PIC18 devices are still developed (2021) and fitted with CIP (Core Independent Peripherals)

===PIC24 and dsPIC===

In 2001, Microchip introduced the dsPIC series of chips, which entered mass production in late 2004. They are Microchip&#x27;s first inherently 16-bit microcontrollers. PIC24 devices are designed as general purpose microcontrollers. dsPIC devices include digital signal processing capabilities in addition.

Although still similar to earlier PIC architectures, there are significant enhancements:

* All registers are 16 bits wide
* Program counter is 22 bits (bits 22:1; bit 0 is always 0)
* Instructions are 24 bits wide
* Data address space expanded to 64 KiB
* First 2 KiB is reserved for peripheral control registers
* Data bank switching is not required unless RAM exceeds 62 KiB
* &quot;f operand&quot; direct addressing extended to 13 bits (8 KiB)
* 16 W registers available for register-register operations.(But operations on f operands always reference W0.)
* Instructions come in byte and (16-bit) word forms
* Stack is in RAM (with W15 as stack pointer); there is no hardware stack
* W14 is the frame pointer
* Data stored in ROM may be accessed directly (&quot;Program Space Visibility&quot;)
* Vectored interrupts for different interrupt sources

Some features are:

* (16×16)-bit single-cycle multiplication and other digital signal processing operations
* hardware multiply–accumulate (MAC)
* hardware divide assist (19 cycles for 32/16-bit divide)
* barrel shifting - for both accumulators and general purpose registers
* bit reversal
* hardware support for loop indexing
* peripheral direct memory access

dsPICs can be programmed in C using Microchip&#x27;s XC16 compiler (formerly called C30), which is a variant of GCC.

Instruction ROM is 24 bits wide. Software can access ROM in 16-bit words, where even words hold the least significant 16 bits of each instruction, and odd words hold the most significant 8 bits. The high half of odd words reads as zero. The program counter is 23 bits wide, but the least significant bit is always 0, so there are 22 modifiable bits.

Instructions come in two main varieties, with most important operations (add, xor, shifts, etc.) allowing both forms:

* The first is like the classic PIC instructions, with an operation between a specified f register (i.e. the first 8K of RAM) and a single accumulator W0, with a destination select bit selecting which is updated with the result. (The W registers are memory-mapped. so the f operand may be any W register.)
* The second form is more conventional, allowing three operands, which may be any of 16 W registers. The destination and one of the sources also support addressing modes, allowing the operand to be in memory pointed to by a W register.

===PIC32M MIPS-based line===
Microchip&#x27;s PIC32M products use the PIC trademark, but have a completely different architecture, and are described here only briefly.

====PIC32MX====
In November 2007, Microchip introduced the PIC32MX family of 32-bit microcontrollers, based on the MIPS32 M4K Core. The device can be programmed using the Microchip MPLAB C Compiler for PIC32 MCUs, a variant of the GCC compiler. The first 18 models currently in production (PIC32MX3xx and PIC32MX4xx) are pin to pin compatible and share the same peripherals set with the PIC24FxxGA0xx family of (16-bit) devices, allowing the use of common libraries, software and hardware tools. Today, starting at 28 pin in small QFN packages up to high performance devices with Ethernet, CAN and USB OTG, full family range of mid-range 32-bit microcontrollers are available.

The PIC32 architecture brought a number of new features to Microchip portfolio, including:

* The highest execution speed 80 MIPS (120+ Dhrystone )
* The largest flash memory: 512 kB
* One instruction per clock cycle execution
* The first cached processor
* Allows execution from RAM
* Full Speed Host/Dual Role and OTG USB capabilities
* Full JTAG and 2-wire programming and debugging
* Real-time trace

====PIC32MZ====
In November 2013, Microchip introduced the PIC32MZ series of microcontrollers, based on the MIPS M14K core. The PIC32MZ series include:

* 252 MHz core speed, 415 DMIPS
* Up to 2 MB Flash and 512 KB RAM
* New peripherals including high-speed USB, crypto engine and SQI

In 2015, Microchip released the PIC32MZ EF family, using the updated MIPS M5150 Warrior M-class processor.

In 2017, Microchip introduced the PIC32MZ DA Family, featuring an integrated graphics controller, graphics processor and 32MB of DDR2 DRAM.

====PIC32MM====
In June 2016, Microchip introduced the PIC32MM family, specialized for low-power and low-cost applications. The PIC32MM features core-independent peripherals, sleep modes down to 500 nA, and 4 x 4 mm packages. The PIC32MM microcontrollers use the MIPS Technologies M4K, a 32-bit MIPS32 processor.
They are meant for very low power consumption and limited to 25 MHz.
Their key advantage is to support the 16-bit instructions of MIPS, making program size much more compact (about 40%)

====PIC32MK====
Microchip introduced the PIC32MK family in 2017, specialized for motor control, industrial control, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and multi-channel CAN applications.

===PIC32C Arm-based line===
Microchip&#x27;s PIC32C products also use the PIC trademark, but similarly have a completely different architecture. PIC32C products employ the Arm processor architecture, including various lines using Cortex-M0+, M4, M7, M23, and M33 cores. They are offered in addition to the Arm-based SAM series of MCUs which Microchip inherited from its acquisition of Atmel.

=== PIC64 ===
Microchip&#x27;s PIC64 products use the PIC trademark, but have a completely different architecture, and are described here only briefly.

In July 2024, Microchip introduced the PIC64 series of high-performance multi-core microprocessors. The series will initially use the RISC-V instruction set, however Microchip is also planning versions with ARM Cortex-A cores. The PIC64 series will include the PIC64GX line, which focuses on intelligent edge applications, and the PIC64-HPSC line, which is radiation-hardened and focuses on spaceflight applications.

==Core architecture==
The PIC architecture (excluding the unrelated PIC32 and PIC64) is a one-operand accumulator machine like the PDP-8 or the Apollo Guidance Computer. Its characteristics are:

* One accumulator (W0), which is an implied operand of almost every instruction.
* A small number of fixed-length instructions, with mostly fixed timing (2 clock cycles, or 4 clock cycles in 8-bit models).
* A small amount of addressable data space (32, 128, or 256 bytes, depending on the family), extended through banking
* Separate code and data spaces (Harvard architecture).
* Instruction memory is wider than data memory, allowing immediate constants within an instruction. (This is a major difference from the other early accumulator machines mentioned above.)
* The second operand is a memory location &quot;or&quot; an immediate constant.
* There are no other addressing modes, although an indirect address mode can be emulated using the indirect register(s).
* Data-space mapped CPU, port, and peripheral registers
** ALU status flags are mapped into the data space
** The program counter is also mapped into the data space and writeable (this is used to implement indirect jumps).
* A hardware stack for storing return addresses
* There are only unconditional branch instructions
* Conditional execution is achieved via conditional skip instructions, which conditionally nullify the following instruction.

There is no distinction between memory space and register space because the RAM serves the job of both memory and registers, and the RAM is usually just referred to as &quot;the register file&quot; or simply as &quot;the registers&quot;.

===Data space (RAM)===
PICs have a set of registers that function as general-purpose RAM. Special-purpose control registers for on-chip hardware resources are also mapped into the data space. The addressability of memory varies depending on device series, and all PIC device types have some banking mechanism to extend addressing to additional memory (but some device models have only one bank implemented). Later series of devices feature move instructions, which can cover the whole addressable space, independent of the selected bank. In earlier devices, any register move must be achieved through the accumulator.

To implement indirect addressing, a &quot;file select register&quot; (FSR) and &quot;indirect register&quot; (INDF) are used. A register number is written to the FSR, after which reads from or writes to INDF will actually be from or to the register pointed to by FSR. Later devices extended this concept with post- and pre- increment/decrement for greater efficiency in accessing sequentially stored data. This also allows FSR to be treated almost like a stack pointer (SP).

External data memory is not directly addressable except in some PIC18 devices with high pin count. However, general I/O ports can be used to implement a parallel bus or a serial interface for accessing external memory and other peripherals (using subroutines), with the caveat that such programmed memory access is (of course) much slower than access to the native memory of the PIC MCU.

===Code space===
The code space is generally implemented as on-chip ROM, EPROM or flash ROM. In general, there is no provision for storing code in external memory due to the lack of an external memory interface. The exceptions are PIC17 and select high pin count PIC18 devices.

===Word size===
All PICs handle (and address) data in 8-bit chunks. However, the unit of addressability of the code space is not generally the same as the data space. For example, PICs in the baseline (PIC12) and mid-range (PIC16) families have program memory addressable in the same wordsize as the instruction width, i.e. 12 or 14 bits respectively. In contrast, in the PIC18 series, the program memory is addressed in 8-bit increments (bytes), which differs from the instruction width of 16 bits.

In order to be clear, the program memory capacity is usually stated in number of (single-word) instructions, rather than in bytes.

===Stacks===
PICs have a hardware call stack, which is used to save return addresses. The hardware stack is not software-accessible on earlier devices, but this changed with the PIC18 series devices.

Hardware support for a general-purpose parameter stack was lacking in early series, but this greatly improved in the PIC18 series, making the PIC18 series architecture more friendly to high-level language compilers.

===Instruction set===

PIC instruction sets vary from about 35 instructions for the low-end PICs to over 80 instructions for the high-end PICs. The instruction set includes instructions to perform a variety of operations on registers directly, on the accumulator and a literal constant, or on the accumulator and a register, as well as for conditional execution, and program branching.

A few operations, such as bit setting and testing, can be performed on any numbered register, but 2-input arithmetic operations always involve W (the accumulator), writing the result back to either W or the other operand register. To load a constant, it is necessary to load it into W before it can be moved into another register. On the older cores, all register moves needed to pass through W, but this changed on the &quot;high-end&quot; cores.

PIC cores have skip instructions, which are used for conditional execution and branching. The skip instructions are &quot;skip if bit set&quot; and &quot;skip if bit not set&quot;. Because cores before PIC18 had only unconditional branch instructions, conditional jumps are implemented by a conditional skip (with the opposite condition) followed by an unconditional branch. Skips are also of utility for conditional execution of any immediate single following instruction. It is possible to skip skip instructions. For example, the instruction sequence &quot;skip if A; skip if B; C&quot; will execute C if A is true or if B is false.

The PIC18 series implemented shadow registers: these are registers which save several important registers during an interrupt, providing hardware support for automatically saving processor state when servicing interrupts.

In general, PIC instructions fall into five classes:

* Operation on working register (WREG) with 8-bit immediate (&quot;literal&quot;) operand. E.g. codice_7 (move literal to WREG), codice_8 (AND literal with WREG). One instruction peculiar to the PIC is codice_9, load immediate into WREG and return, which is used with computed branches to produce lookup tables.
* Operation with WREG and indexed register. The result can be written to either the working register (e.g. codice_10). or the selected register (e.g. codice_11).
* Bit operations. These take a register number and a bit number, and perform one of 4 actions: set or clear a bit, and test and skip on set/clear. The latter are used to perform conditional branches. The usual ALU status flags are available in a numbered register so operations such as &quot;branch on carry clear&quot; are possible.
* Control transfers. Other than the skip instructions previously mentioned, there are only two: codice_12 and codice_13.
* A few miscellaneous zero-operand instructions, such as return from subroutine, and codice_14 to enter low-power mode.

===Performance===
The architectural decisions are directed at the maximization of speed-to-cost ratio. The PIC architecture was among the first scalar CPU designs and is still among the simplest and cheapest. The Harvard architecture, in which instructions and data come from separate sources, simplifies timing and microcircuit design greatly, and this benefits clock speed, price, and power consumption.

The PIC instruction set is suited to implementation of fast lookup tables in the program space. Such lookups take one instruction and two instruction cycles. Many functions can be modeled in this way. Optimization is facilitated by the relatively large program space of the PIC (e.g. 4096 × 14-bit words on the 16F690) and by the design of the instruction set, which allows embedded constants. For example, a branch instruction&#x27;s target may be indexed by W, and execute a &quot;RETLW&quot;, which does as it is named return with literal in W.

Interrupt latency is constant at three instruction cycles. External interrupts have to be synchronized with the four-clock instruction cycle, otherwise there can be a one instruction cycle jitter. Internal interrupts are already synchronized. The constant interrupt latency allows PICs to achieve interrupt-driven low-jitter timing sequences. An example of this is a video sync pulse generator. This is no longer true in the newest PIC models, because they have a synchronous interrupt latency of three or four cycles.

===Advantages===
* Small instruction set to learn
* RISC architecture
* Built-in oscillator with selectable speeds
* Easy entry level, in-circuit programming plus in-circuit debugging PICkit units available for less than $50
* Inexpensive microcontrollers
* Wide range of interfaces including I²C, SPI, USB, UART, A/D, programmable comparators, PWM, LIN, CAN, PSP, and Ethernet
* Availability of processors in DIL package makes them easy to handle for hobby use.

===Limitations===
* One accumulator
* Register-bank switching is required to access the entire RAM of many devices
* Operations and registers are not orthogonal; some instructions can address RAM and/or immediate constants, while others can use the accumulator only.

The following stack limitations have been addressed in the PIC18 series, but still apply to earlier cores:

* The hardware call stack is not addressable, so preemptive task switching cannot be implemented
* Software-implemented stacks are not efficient, so it is difficult to generate reentrant code and support local variables

With paged program memory, there are two page sizes to worry about: one for CALL and GOTO and another for computed GOTO (typically used for table lookups). For example, on PIC16, CALL and GOTO have 11 bits of addressing, so the page size is 2048 instruction words. For computed GOTOs, where you add to PCL, the page size is 256 instruction words. In both cases, the upper address bits are provided by the PCLATH register. This register must be changed every time control transfers between pages. PCLATH must also be preserved by any interrupt handler.

===Compiler development===
While several commercial compilers are available, in 2008, Microchip released their own C compilers, C18 and C30, for the line of 18F 24F and 30/33F processors.

As of 2013, Microchip offers their XC series of compilers, for use with MPLAB X. Microchip will eventually phase out its older compilers, such as C18, and recommends using their XC series compilers for new designs.

The RISC instruction set of the PIC assembly language code can make the overall flow difficult to comprehend. Judicious use of simple macros can increase the readability of PIC assembly language. For example, the original Parallax PIC assembler (&quot;SPASM&quot;) has macros, which hide W and make the PIC look like a two-address machine. It has macro instructions like codice_15 (move the data from address &quot;a&quot; to address &quot;b&quot;) and codice_16 (add data from address &quot;a&quot; to data in address &quot;b&quot;). It also hides the skip instructions by providing three-operand branch macro instructions, such as codice_17 (compare &quot;a&quot; with &quot;b&quot; and jump to &quot;dest&quot; if they are not equal).

==Hardware features==
PIC devices generally feature:

* Flash memory (program memory, programmed using MPLAB devices)
* SRAM (data memory)
* EEPROM (programmable at run-time)
* Sleep mode (power savings)
* Watchdog timer
* Various crystal or RC oscillator configurations, or an external clock

===Variants===
Within a series, there are still many device variants depending on what hardware resources the chip features:
* General purpose I/O pins
* Internal clock oscillators
* 8/16/32 bit timers
* Synchronous/Asynchronous Serial Interface USART
* MSSP Peripheral for I²C and SPI communications
* Capture/Compare and PWM modules
* Analog-to-digital converters (up to ~1.0 Msps)
* USB, Ethernet, CAN interfacing support
* External memory interface
* Integrated analog RF front ends (PIC16F639, and rfPIC).
* KEELOQ Rolling code encryption peripheral (encode/decode)
* And many more

===Trends===
The first generation of PICs with EPROM storage have been almost completely replaced by chips with flash memory. Likewise, the original 12-bit instruction set of the PIC1650 and its direct descendants has been superseded by 14-bit and 16-bit instruction sets. Microchip still sells OTP (one-time-programmable) and windowed (UV-erasable) versions of some of its EPROM based PICs for legacy support or volume orders. The Microchip website lists PICs that are not electrically erasable as OTP. UV erasable windowed versions of these chips can be ordered.

===Part number===
The F in a PICMicro part number generally indicates the PICmicro uses flash memory and can be erased electronically. Conversely, a C generally means it can only be erased by exposing the die to ultraviolet light (which is only possible if a windowed package style is used). An exception to this rule is the PIC16C84, which uses EEPROM and is therefore electrically erasable.

An L in the name indicates the part will run at a lower voltage, often with frequency limits imposed. Parts designed specifically for low voltage operation, within a strict range of 3 – 3.6 volts, are marked with a J in the part number. These parts are also uniquely I/O tolerant as they will accept up to 5 V as inputs.

==Development tools==

Microchip provides a freeware IDE package called MPLAB X, which includes an assembler, linker, software simulator, and debugger. They also sell C compilers for the PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18, PIC24, PIC32 and dsPIC, which integrate cleanly with MPLAB X. Free versions of the C compilers are also available with all features. But for the free versions, optimizations will be disabled after 60 days.

Several third parties develop C language compilers for PICs, many of which integrate to MPLAB and/or feature their own IDE. A fully featured compiler for the PICBASIC language to program PIC microcontrollers is available from meLabs, Inc. Mikroelektronika offers PIC compilers in C, BASIC and Pascal programming languages.

A graphical programming language, Flowcode, exists capable of programming 8- and 16-bit PIC devices and generating PIC-compatible C code. It exists in numerous versions from a free demonstration to a more complete professional edition.

The Proteus Design Suite is able to simulate many of the popular 8 and 16-bit PIC devices along with other circuitry that is connected to the PIC on the schematic. The program to be simulated can be developed within Proteus itself, MPLAB or any other development tool.

==Device programmers==
Devices called &quot;programmers&quot; are traditionally used to get program code into the target PIC. Most PICs that Microchip currently sells feature ICSP (in-circuit serial programming) and/or LVP (low-voltage programming) capabilities, allowing the PIC to be programmed while it is sitting in the target circuit.

Microchip offers programmers/debuggers under the MPLAB and PICKit series. MPLAB ICD5 and MPLAB REAL ICE are the current programmers and debuggers for professional engineering, while PICKit 5 is a low-cost programmer / debugger line for hobbyists and students.

===Bootloading===
Many of the higher end flash based PICs can also self-program (write to their own program memory), a process known as bootloading. Demo boards are available with a small factory-programmed bootloader that can be used to load user programs over an interface such as RS-232 or USB, thus obviating the need for a programmer device.

Alternatively there is bootloader firmware available that the user can load onto the PIC using ICSP. After programming the bootloader onto the PIC, the user can then reprogram the device using RS232 or USB, in conjunction with specialized computer software.

The advantages of a bootloader over ICSP is faster programming speeds, immediate program execution following programming, and the ability to both debug and program using the same cable.

===Third party===
There are many programmers for PIC microcontrollers, ranging from the extremely simple designs which rely on ICSP to allow direct download of code from a host computer, to intelligent programmers that can verify the device at several supply voltages. Many of these complex programmers use a pre-programmed PIC themselves to send the programming commands to the PIC that is to be programmed. The intelligent type of programmer is needed to program earlier PIC models (mostly EPROM type) which do not support in-circuit programming.

Third party programmers range from plans to build your own, to self-assembly kits and fully tested ready-to-go units. Some are simple designs which require a PC to do the low-level programming signalling (these typically connect to the serial or parallel port and consist of a few simple components), while others have the programming logic built into them (these typically use a serial or USB connection, are usually faster, and are often built using PICs themselves for control).

==Debugging==
===In-circuit debugging===
All newer PIC devices feature an ICD (in-circuit debugging) interface, built into the CPU core, that allows for interactive debugging of the program in conjunction with MPLAB IDE. MPLAB ICD and MPLAB REAL ICE debuggers can communicate with this interface using the ICSP interface.

This debugging system comes at a price however, namely limited breakpoint count (1 on older devices, 3 on newer devices), loss of some I/O (with the exception of some surface mount 44-pin PICs which have dedicated lines for debugging) and loss of some on-chip features.

Some devices do not have on-chip debug support, due to cost or lack of pins. Some larger chips also have no debug module. To debug these devices, a special -ICD version of the chip mounted on a daughter board which provides dedicated ports is required. Some of these debug chips are able to operate as more than one type of chip by the use of selectable jumpers on the daughter board. This allows broadly identical architectures that do not feature all the on-chip peripheral devices to be replaced by a single -ICD chip. For example: the 16F690-ICD will function as one of six different parts, each of which features none, some or all of five on-chip peripherals.

===In-circuit emulators===
Microchip offers three full in-circuit emulators: the MPLAB ICE2000 (parallel interface, a USB converter is available); the newer MPLAB ICE4000 (USB 2.0 connection); and most recently, the REAL ICE (USB 2.0 connection). All such tools are typically used in conjunction with MPLAB IDE for source-level interactive debugging of code running on the target.

==Operating systems==
PIC projects may utilize real-time operating systems such as FreeRTOS, AVIX RTOS, uRTOS, Salvo RTOS or other similar libraries for task scheduling and prioritization.

An open source project by Serge Vakulenko adapts 2.11BSD to the PIC32 architecture, under the name RetroBSD. This brings a familiar Unix-like operating system, including an onboard development environment, to the microcontroller, within the constraints of the onboard hardware.

==Clones==

===Parallax===

Parallax produced a series of PICmicro-like microcontrollers known as the Parallax SX. It is currently discontinued. Designed to be architecturally similar to the PIC microcontrollers used in the original versions of the BASIC Stamp, SX microcontrollers replaced the PIC in several subsequent versions of that product.

Parallax&#x27;s SX are 8-bit RISC microcontrollers, using a 12-bit instruction word, which run fast at 75 MHz (75 MIPS). They include up to 4096 12-bit words of flash memory and up to 262 bytes of random access memory, an eight bit counter and other support logic. There are software library modules to emulate I²C and SPI interfaces, UARTs, frequency generators, measurement counters and PWM and sigma-delta A/D converters. Other interfaces are relatively easy to write, and existing modules can be modified to get new features.

===PKK Milandr===

Russian PKK Milandr produces microcontrollers using the PIC17 architecture as the 1886 series.

Program memory consists of up to 64kB Flash memory in the 1886VE2U () or 8kB EEPROM in the 1886VE5U (&quot;1886ВЕ5У&quot;). The 1886VE5U (&quot;1886ВЕ5У&quot;) through 1886VE7U (&quot;1886ВЕ7У&quot;) are specified for the military temperature range of -60 °C to +125 °C. Hardware interfaces in the various parts include USB, CAN, I2C, SPI, as well as A/D and D/A converters. The 1886VE3U (&quot;1886ВЕ3У&quot;) contains a hardware accelerator for cryptographic functions according to GOST 28147-89. There are even radiation-hardened chips with the designations 1886VE8U (&quot;1886ВЕ8У&quot;) and 1886VE10U (&quot;1886ВЕ10У&quot;).

===ELAN Microelectronics===

ELAN Microelectronics Corp. in Taiwan make a line of microcontrollers based on the PIC16 architecture, with 13-bit instructions and a smaller (6-bit) RAM address space.

===Holtek Semiconductor===

Holtek Semiconductor make a large number of very cheap microcontrollers (as low as 8.5 &quot;cents&quot; in quantity) with a 14-bit instruction set strikingly similar to the PIC16.

===Hycon===

Hycon Technology, a Taiwanese manufacturer of mixed-signal chips for portable electronics (multimeters, kitchen scales, etc.), has a proprietary H08 microcontroller series with a 16-bit instruction word very similar to the PIC18 family. (No relation to the Hitachi/Renesas H8 microcontrollers.) The H08A is most like the PIC18; the H08B is a subset.
Although the available instructions are almost identical, their &quot;encoding&quot; is different, as is the memory map and peripherals. For example, the PIC18 allows direct access to RAM at 0x000–0x07F or special function registers at 0xF80–0xFFF by sign-extending an 8-bit address. The H08 places special function registers at 0x000–0x07F and global RAM at 0x080–0x0FF, zero-extending the address.

===Other manufacturers in Asia===
Many ultra-low-cost OTP microcontrollers from Asian manufacturers, found in low-cost consumer electronics are based on the PIC architecture or modified form. Most clones only target the baseline parts (PIC16C5x/PIC12C50x). With any patents on the basic architecture long since expired, Microchip has attempted to sue some manufacturers on copyright grounds,
without success.

<text>Gros Morne National Park is a Canadian national park and World Heritage Site located on the west coast of Newfoundland. At , it is the second largest national park in Atlantic Canada after Torngat Mountains National Park, which has an area of .

The park takes its name from Newfoundland&#x27;s second-highest mountain peak (at ) located within the park. Its French meaning is &quot;large mountain standing alone,&quot; or more literally &quot;great sombre.&quot; Gros Morne is a member of the Long Range Mountains, an outlying range of the Appalachian Mountains, stretching the length of the island&#x27;s west coast. It is the eroded remnants of a mountain range formed 1.2 billion years ago. In 1987, the park was awarded World Heritage Site status by UNESCO because &quot;The park provides a rare example of the process of continental drift, where deep ocean crust and the rocks of the earth&#x27;s mantle lie exposed.&quot;

The Gros Morne National Park Reserve was established in 1973, and was made a national park on October 1, 2005.

The park was the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;.

==Geology==
The park&#x27;s rock formations, made famous by Robert Stevens and Harold Williams, include oceanic crust and mantle rock exposed by the obduction process of plate tectonics, as well as sedimentary rock formed during the Ordovician, Precambrian granite and Palaeozoic igneous rocks. The Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) of the Tremadocian stage and the all Ordovician system is defined in the Green Point section within this park.

The park is located in the Great Northern Peninsula of Western Newfoundland. This peninsula is referred to as the Humber Zone, a Miogeocline, the Highlands of which contain the largest external basement massif of the Grenville Orogeny in the Appalachian Orogen. This Precambrian basement is known as the Long Range Inlier, Long Range Complex or Basement Gneiss Complex, consisting of quartz–feldspar gneisses and granites that are up to 1550 Ma in age. Mt. Gros Morne and Mt. Big Level lie within this Inlier. The western boundary of this inlier (along Western Brook Pond, St. Pauls Inlet, and south of Portl Creek Pond) consists of Devonian and Ordovician thrust faults, where crystalline rocks thrust over Cambrian–Ordovician carbonate rocks and the Lower Paleozoic Humber Arm Allochthon. The Rocky Harbour mélange is a Lower–Middle Ordovician collection of greywacke, quartzite, dolomite shale, chert, limestone blocks within a black, green, and red scaly shale matrix, which occurs along the shore from West Brook Pond to Humber Arm (Bay of Islands). The south portion of the park, Table Mtn. (Tablelands) and North Arm Mtn., consists of Upper Cambrian and Lower Ordovician ophiolites known as the Bay of Islands Complex, Little Post Complex, and Old Man Cove Formation. Finally, a Pleistocene ice cap flowed radially across the island, developing fjords such as Bonne Bay.

===Tablelands===

The Tablelands, found between the towns of Trout River and Woody Point in south west of Gros Morne National Park, look more like a barren desert than traditional Newfoundland. This is due to the ultramafic rock – peridotite – which makes up the Tablelands. It is thought to originate in the Earth&#x27;s mantle and was forced up from the depths during a plate collision several hundred million years ago. Peridotite lacks some of the usual nutrients required to sustain most plant life and has a toxic quality, hence its barren appearance. Peridotite is also high in iron, which accounts for its brownish colour (rusted colour). Underneath the weathered surface zone, the unweathered rock is a dark green colour.

== Soils ==
The many soil associations mapped in the park reflect the wide variety of bedrock. The Silver Mountain soil association, dominant in the northeastern area, is a very stony sandy loam developed on glacial till overlying granite, granitic gneiss and schist. Similar rocks underlie the St. Paul&#x27;s Inlet association farther west. Sedimentary rocks (including some dolomitic limestone) in the southeastern sector support the North Lake association of stony sandy loam. An association of mostly-shallow loam, the Cox&#x27;s Cove, occupies a discontinuous band over shale, slate, limestone and sandstone near the coast. The coastal strip north of Bonne Bay is mostly underlain by the peaty Gull&#x27;s Marsh association and the coarse Sally&#x27;s Cove association except for an area of clay (Wood&#x27;s Island association) around Rocky Harbour. The stony infertile soils of the ultramafic tablelands south of Bonne Bay belong to the Serpentine Range association.

==Western Brook Pond – Fjord==
Western Brook Pond is a fresh water fjord which was carved out by glaciers during the most recent ice age from 25,000 to about 10,000 years ago. Once the glaciers melted, the land, which had been pushed down by the weight of the ice sheet, rebounded and the outlet to the sea was cut off. The long narrow &quot;pond&quot; then filled in with fresh water. The water in the fjord is extremely pure and is assigned the highest purity rating available for natural bodies of water. Pissing Mare Falls, the highest waterfall in eastern North America and 199th highest in the world, flows into Western Brook Pond. Sedimentary rocks, some of them calcareous, underlie the westernmost shores. Elsewhere, granitic gneiss is dominant.

==Nature and wildlife==
The most notable animal in the park is the moose, part of a booming population that was introduced to Newfoundland around 1900. Other common wildlife in the park include red foxes and Arctic foxes, an ecotype of caribou (&quot;R.t caribou&quot;), black bears, snowshoe hares, red squirrels, lynxes, river otters and beavers. Harbour seals are common in St. Pauls inlet, and cetaceans (minkes, humpbacks, fins, pilots, orcas, atlantic white-sided dolphins, harbour porpoises) may be in the area especially during the capelin season in early summer. Many bird species can be found in the park, from shorebirds along the ocean to birds of the bogs and interior forests.

==World Heritage Site==
In 1987, the park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site for both its geological history and its exceptional scenery. The geology of the park in particular illustrates the concept of plate tectonics, and has shed important light on geological evolution and its processes.

In respect of its key role in the development of an understanding of plate tectonics, the Mohorovičić discontinuity at Gros Morne was included by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) in its assemblage of 100 &#x27;geological heritage sites&#x27; around the world in a listing published in October 2022.

==Trails==
Hiking the trails is a popular activity at Gros Morne. There are about 20 marked day trip trails, exploring coastal and interior areas of the park. One of the more strenuous dayhikes is the 16 km hike over Gros Morne Mountain. This trail is also called the James Callaghan Trail after the former British Prime Minister, who visited in 1976, in recognition of his conservation efforts. A small controversy arose after Callaghan did not visit the trail that had been named in his honour.

The interior of the park can also be accessed, notably through the multi-day Long Range Traverse between Western Brook Pond and Gros Morne Mountain.

== Arts and culture ==
The park is home to many arts festivals, including Gros Morne Theatre Festival, Writers at Woody Point, Gros Morne Summer Music, and Trails, Tales and Tunes.

<doc id="184600" wikidata="Q1631315" url="?curid=184600" title="Leapfrog">
<text>Leapfrog usually is a merry children&#x27;s game of physical movement of the body in which players vault over each other&#x27;s stooped backs. Sometimes, when forcibly and near-torturously imposed upon unwilling adults (see Nazi uses below in the &quot;Variations&quot; section), the game has had less-pleasant outcomes.

== History ==
Games of this sort have been called by this name since at least the late sixteenth century.

== Gameplay ==
The first participant remains still after putting their hands on their own knees while bending over, which is called &quot;giving a back&quot;. With dispatch the next player swiftly dashes forward, and (while in forward-motion), briefly plants their hands upon the first&#x27;s back for push-off support (while straddling with legs wide apart) while hoping to vault clear-over that first stooping player. This jumper, upon landing, then advances a few steps ahead and themself does &quot;give a back&quot; by stooping-over in the same manner as the first player. (Meanwhile, the first player continues &quot;giving a back&quot;.) A third player leaps over the first and second, and then also &quot;gives a back&quot; by stooping over. A fourth jumper would leap over all previous others successively. Any number of additional players would act as had the previous: leaping over whoever is there and then stooping-over (&quot;giving a back&quot;) to then be jumped-over by whoever is leaping next. The number of participants is not fixed. When eventually all players are stooping, the last in the line begins leaping over all the others in turn. Time-length of gameplay and who (if anyone) &quot;wins&quot; is not standardized; the participants decide among themselves.

== Variations ==

The French version of this game is called &quot;saute-mouton&quot; (literally &quot;leapsheep&quot;), and the Romanian is called &quot;capra&quot; (&quot;mounting rack&quot; or &quot;goat&quot;). In India it is known as &quot;Aar Ghodi Ki Par Ghodi&quot; (meaning &quot;horseleap&quot;). In Italy the game is called &quot;la cavallina&quot; (i.e. &quot;small&quot; or &quot;baby female horse&quot;). In Dutch it is called &quot;bokspringen&quot; (literally &quot;goatjumping&quot;; a &quot;bok&quot; is a male goat) or &quot;haasje-over&quot; (literally &quot;hare-over&quot;).

In China this game is known as &quot;leap goat&quot; (&quot;跳山羊&quot;), which is played in pairs. One player, acting as &quot;the goat&quot;, leaps over the back of the other player, who plays the role of &quot;the rock/mountain&quot;. Then they switch roles, and &quot;the rock&quot; rises a bit each time they switch. Both players continue playing until one &quot;goat&quot; fails leaping &quot;the rock/mountain&quot; as the result of its rising. 

 In the Filipino culture, a similar game is called &quot;luksóng báka&quot; (literally &quot;leap cow&quot;), in which the &quot;it&quot; rests his hands on his knees and bends over, and then the other players —in succession—place their hands on the back of the “it” and leaps over by straddling legs wide apart on each side; whoever&#x27;s legs touch any part of the body of the “it” becomes the next “it.” 

In the Korean and Japanese versions (말뚝박기 lit. &quot;piledriving&quot; and 馬跳び &quot;うまとび&quot; &quot;umatobi&quot;, lit. &quot;horseleap&quot;, respectively), one player &#x27;leaps&#x27; over the backs of the other players who stoop close enough to form a continuous line, attempting to cause the line to collapse under the weight of the riders.

At times, leapfrog&#x27;s demanding physical exertion was coercively forced upon unwilling adults, as happened at some Nazi German camps. &quot;Bundesarchiv&quot; photos document such activity having occurred at Mauthausen concentration camp and other sites.

<text>A landscape architect is a person who is educated in the field of landscape architecture. The practice of landscape architecture includes: site analysis, site inventory, site planning, land planning, planting design, grading, storm water management, sustainable design, construction specification, and ensuring that all plans meet the current building codes and local and federal ordinances.

The practice of landscape architecture dates to some of the earliest of human cultures and just as much as the practice of medicine has been inimical to the species and ubiquitous worldwide for several millennia. However, this article examines the modern profession and educational discipline of those practicing the design of landscape architecture.

In the 1700s, Humphry Repton described his occupation as &quot;landscape gardener&quot; on business cards he had prepared to represent him in work that now would be described as that of a landscape architect.

The title, &quot;landscape architect&quot;, was first used by Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York City&#x27;s Central Park in Manhattan and numerous projects of large scale both public and private. He was the founder of a firm of landscape architects who employed highly skilled professionals to design and execute aspects of projects designed under his auspices.

Depending on the jurisdiction, landscape architects who pass state requirements to become registered, licensed, or certified may be entitled to use the postnominal letters corresponding to their seal, typically RLA (Registered Landscape Architect) or more recently, PLA (Professional Landscape Architect) n. In the US, all 50 states have adopted licensure. The American Society of Landscape Architects endorses the postnominal letters PLA, for Professional Landscape Architect, even though there is no legal or professional distinction between the use of RLA or PLA.

==Australia==

The Australian Institute of Landscape Architects (AILA) states that &quot;Landscape Architects research, plan, design, and advise on the stewardship, conservation, and sustainability of development of the environment and spaces, both within and beyond the built environment&quot;. This definition of the profession of landscape architect is based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations, International Labour Office, Geneva.
Some notable Australian landscape architects include Catherin Bull, Kevin Taylor, Richard Weller, Peter Spooner, Sydney based writer and designer (Doris) Jocelyn Brown, Grace Fraser,
Bruce Mackenzie, Mary Jeavons, Janet Conrad, Dr Jim Sinatra, William Guilfoyle, Ina Higgins, Edna Walling, and Ellis Stones.

To become a recognised professional landscape architect in Australia, the first requirement is to obtain a degree in landscape architecture accredited by the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects. After at least two years of recognised professional practice, graduates may submit for further assessment to obtain full professional recognition by AILA.

==Canada==
The Canadian Society of Landscape Architects (CSLA) is the country&#x27;s professional association of landscape architects. Some notable Canadian landscape architects include Cornelia Oberlander, Claude Cormier, Peter Jacobs, Janet Rosenberg, Marc Ryan, and Michael Hough.

==United Kingdom==
The Landscape Institute is the recognised body relating to the field of Landscape Architecture throughout the United Kingdom. To become a recognised landscape architect in the UK takes approximately seven years. To begin the process, one has to study an accredited course by the Landscape Institute to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in landscape architecture or a similar field. Following this one must progress onto a postgraduate diploma in the field of landscape architecture covering the subject in far greater detail such as mass urban planning, construction, and planting. Following this, the trainee must complete the Pathway to Chartership, a challenging program set out by the Landscape Institute. Following this, one is awarded a full landscape architect title and membership among the Chartered Members of the Landscape Institute (CMLI).

==United States==

The United States is the founding country of the formal profession entitled landscape architecture. Those in this field work both to create an aesthetically pleasing setting and also to protect and preserve the environment in an area. In the U.S., a need to formalize the practice and a name for the profession was resolved in 1899 with the formation of the American Society of Landscape Architects. A few of the many talented and influential landscape architects who have been based in the United States are: Frederick Law Olmsted, Beatrix Farrand, Jens Jensen, Ian McHarg, Thomas Church, Arthur Shurtleff, Ellen Biddle Shipman John Nolen, Lawrence Halprin, Charles Edgar Dickinson, Iris Miller, and Robert Royston.

Royston summed up one American theme:
Landscape architecture practices the fine art of relating the structure of culture to the nature of landscape, to the end that people can use it, enjoy it, and preserve it.

==Work scope==
The following is an outline of the typical scope of service for a landscape architect:
# Developing new or improved theories, policy, and methods for landscape planning, design, and management at local, regional, national, and multinational levels 
# Developing policies and plans and implementing and monitoring proposals for conservation and recreation areas such as national parks

<doc id="184603" wikidata="Q630800" url="?curid=184603" title="Slacker">
<text>A slacker is someone who habitually avoids work or lacks work ethic.

==Origin==
According to different sources, the term &quot;slacker&quot; dates back to about 1790 or 1898. &quot;Slacker&quot; gained some recognition during the British Gezira Scheme in the early to mid-20th century, when Sudanese labourers protested their relative powerlessness by working lethargically, a form of protest known as &quot;slacking&quot;.

==World Wars==
In the United States during World War I, the word &quot;slacker&quot; was commonly used to describe someone who was not participating in the war effort, specifically someone who avoided military service, equivalent to the later term &quot;draft dodger&quot;. Attempts to track down such evaders were called &quot;slacker raids&quot;.

During World War I, U.S. Senator Miles Poindexter discussed whether inquiries &quot;to separate the cowards and the slackers from those who had not violated the draft&quot; had been managed properly. A &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; headline on 7 September 1918, read, &quot;Slacker Is Doused in Barrel of Paint&quot;.

The term was also used during the World War II period in the United States. In 1940, &quot;Time&quot; quoted the U.S. Army on managing the military draft efficiently: &quot;War is not going to wait while every slacker resorts to endless appeals.&quot;

==Evolution==
The shift in the use of &quot;slacker&quot; from its draft-related meaning to a more general sense of the avoidance of work is unclear. In April 1948, &quot;The New Republic&quot; referred to &quot;resentment against taxes levied to aid slackers&quot;. An article tracking the evolution of the meaning of the term &quot;Slacker&quot; in defamation lawsuits between World War I and 2010, entitled &quot;When Slacker Was a Dirty Word: Defamation and Draft Dodging During World War I,&quot; was written by Attorney David Kluft for the Trademark and Copyright Law Blog.

==Late 20th century and onward==
The term achieved renewed popularity following its use in the 1985 film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in which James Tolkan&#x27;s character Mr. Strickland chronically refers to Marty McFly, his father George McFly, Biff Tannen, and a group of teenaged delinquents as &quot;slackers&quot;. It gained subsequent exposure from the 1989 Superchunk single &quot;Slack Motherfucker&quot;, and the 1990 film &quot;Slacker&quot;. The television series &quot;Rox&quot; has been noted for its &quot;depiction of the slacker lifestyle ... of the early &#x27;90s&quot;.

&quot;Slacker&quot; became widely used in the 1990s to refer to a type of apathetic youth who were cynical and uninterested in political or social causes. This type became a stereotype for members of Generation X. Richard Linklater, director of the aforementioned 1990 film, commented on the term&#x27;s meaning in a 1995 interview, stating that &quot;I think the cheapest definition [of a slacker] would be someone who&#x27;s just lazy, hangin&#x27; out, doing nothing. I&#x27;d like to change that to somebody who&#x27;s not doing what&#x27;s expected of them. Somebody who&#x27;s trying to live an interesting life, doing what they want to do, and if that takes time to find, so be it.&quot;

The term has connotations of &quot;apathy and aimlessness&quot;. It is also used to refer to an educated person who avoids work, possibly as an antimaterialist stance, who may be viewed as an underachiever.

&quot;Slackers&quot; have been the subject of many films and television shows, particularly comedies. Notable examples include the films &quot;Slacker&quot;, &quot;Slackers&quot;, &quot;Clerks&quot;, &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;, &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, &quot;You, Me and Dupree&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Party&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;Withnail and I&quot;, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;Old School&quot;, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;Trainspotting,&quot; &quot;Animal House&quot;, and &quot;Bill and Ted&quot;, as well as the television shows &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;, &quot;Spaced&quot;, and &quot;The Royle Family&quot;.

&quot;The Idler&quot;, a British magazine founded in 1993, represents an alternative to contemporary society&#x27;s work ethic and aims &quot;to return dignity to the art of loafing&quot;.

<text>Radford University is a public university in Radford, Virginia, United States. It is one of the state&#x27;s eight doctorate-granting public universities. Founded in 1910, Radford offers curricula for undergraduates in more than 100 fields, graduate programs including the M.F.A., M.B.A., M.A., M.S., Ed.S., Psy.D., M.S.W., and specialized doctoral programs in health-related professions. It is classified among &quot;Doctoral/Professional Universities&quot;.

==History==
The State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Radford was founded in Radford as a women&#x27;s college in 1910. In 1924, the school was renamed the State Teachers College at Radford, with the primary intent of training teachers in the Appalachian region. In 1943, as part of the state&#x27;s consolidation movement, the college merged with the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in nearby Blacksburg, serving as the then predominately male land-grant college&#x27;s women&#x27;s campus. The merger dissolved in 1964 and Radford College became a coeducational institution in 1972. Following a period of sustained and significant growth, Radford College was granted university status in 1979. In 2008, the Virginia General Assembly authorized three doctoral programs at Radford University, and the first doctoral degrees were awarded in 2011.

===Presidents===
Radford University&#x27;s current president is Bret S. Danilowicz, who took this role on July 1, 2022. The university&#x27;s administration is overseen by a 15-member board, whose members are appointed by the Governor of the Commonwealth and serve four-year terms. Each year, the board also selects a student and a faculty member to serve as advisory representatives.

List of presidents:

* John Preston McConnell, 1911–1937
* David Wilbur Peters, 1938–1951
* Charles Knox Martin Jr., 1952–1972, Chancellor, 1972–73, President Emeritus
* Donald Newton Dedmon, 1972–1994
* Douglas Covington, 1995–2005, President Emeritus
* Penelope Ward Kyle, 2005–2016, President Emeritus
* Brian Hemphill, 2016-2021
*Carolyn Ringer Lepre, (interim) 2021-2022
* Bret S. Danilowicz, 2022–present

==Academics==
Radford University&#x27;s undergraduate programs emphasize the liberal arts, business, sciences, and teacher education. The graduate and undergraduate programs in business administration offered by the College of Business and Economics at Radford University are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

The university has a student/faculty ratio of 14:1 with an average class size of 19.

More than 80 percent of faculty members hold doctorates or other terminal degrees (M.F.A., M.B.A., Ph.D., J.D., etc.) in their fields. Special programs include Study Abroad, Honors Academy, RU Connections freshmen living/learning communities, internships, co-ops, practical and service learning, Army ROTC, leading to commissions in the U.S. Army, and undergraduate research opportunities.

Radford University and Northern Virginia Community College signed a Guaranteed Transfer Partnership Agreement on August 28, 2017.

==Undergraduate and graduate colleges==
The university is organized into seven undergraduate colleges and schools, and one graduate college:

* College of Humanities and Behavioral Sciences
* Davis College of Business and Economics
* College of Education and Human Development
* Waldron College of Health and Human Services
* Artis College of Science and Technology
* College of Visual and Performing Arts
* College of Nursing
* College of Graduate Studies and Research

The College of Graduate Studies and Research offers eighteen-degree programs in fields such as art, business, communication, counseling, criminal justice, education, English, music, nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, psychology, and social work. The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia has authorized three doctoral programs at Radford in counseling psychology, physical therapy, and nursing practice. The Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.) program in Counseling Psychology admitted its first students in the fall of 2008. The doctorate in physical therapy program began in the summer of 2009. The first Doctor of Nursing Practice students began their studies in an online program in the fall of 2010.

==Campus and community==

Radford University is an campus located in a residential area of Radford, Virginia. The town is located in the Virginia Highlands, between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains at a double bend in the New River. Nearly all of the 31 administrative, academic, student services, and residence halls, some built in a red-brick Georgian style, are located on a main lawn and two quadrangles and a pedestrian thoroughfare in a area, while a large adjoining area along the New River separated from the main campus by U.S. Route 11 and the Norfolk Southern railroad holds the university&#x27;s athletic facilities, student parking lots, and student apartments. The university opened a new COBE building (College of Business and Economics) in 2012. In 2014 a New Student Fitness Center opened. A new Center for Sciences opened during the spring semester of 2016. The following fall semester, the new CHBS (College of Humanities and Behavioral Sciences) Building opened its doors. As of 2016, nearly all dorms at Radford have been renovated. Renovations are currently ongoing for several buildings on campus. Radford is located on exits 105 and 109 of Interstate 81, with accessibility to nearby I-77.

Bordering the Little River, and about five miles from campus, is the Selu Conservancy, a reserve, observatory, retreat, and conference center owned by the University Foundation.

Radford University is also home to the Radford University planetarium – a permanent planetarium with a 10-meter dome, running the Digistar 5 planetarium software. The planetarium is primarily operated by work-study students and is maintained by the physics department. All shows are free for all attendees.

==Student life==
Around 3,800 of Radford&#x27;s students live on campus in 15 residence halls.

Radford University has more than 250 student clubs and organizations. These range from service and honors organizations to performing arts and intramural sports. Radford is also home to Highlander Student Media (RUHSM), with a variety of student media organizations, such as &quot;The Tartan&quot; (student-run newspaper), Radio Free Radford, &quot;The Beehive&quot; (yearbook/magazine), &quot;Exit 109&quot; (literary magazine), ROC-TV, a.k.a. &quot;Radford On Camera&quot; (student TV station), and &quot;Whim&quot; (online magazine)

Radford also has a variety of Greek life fraternities and sororities. More than 17 religious organizations are part of the Radford University Campus Ministers&#x27; Association (RUCMA). They hold religious events, masses, and ceremonies throughout the academic year.

==Athletics==

The university&#x27;s teams are known as the Highlanders (in honor of the region&#x27;s Scots-Irish heritage) and compete in the Big South Conference. Radford offers 16 NCAA varsity sports for men and women. The Radford men&#x27;s basketball team won the Big South Conference tournament in 1998, 2009, and 2018. Radford also won the Big South Conference Men&#x27;s Tennis Championship in 2007, 2008, and 2009 as well as the Big South Softball Championship in 2009.

The Radford baseball team has won the Big South Conference Championship in 2015, and 2017. In 2015, they defeated the Chanticleers of Coastal Carolina with a walk-off single by Hunter Higgerson. The team finished with a final record of 45–16. The team was selected to compete in the Nashville Regional where they went 2–2, with wins against Lipscomb University and Indiana University, before losing to the 2015 National Runner-up Vanderbilt University, in the Regional Finals.

The Radford men&#x27;s rugby club team won the Division II National Championship in 2003 and 2008.

Student athletes have exclusive use of the Dedmon Center, a recreational and convocation complex that opened in 1981. The Dedmon Center features a 1/6-mile indoor jogging track, a weight-training room, locker rooms, and several team rooms. The main arena features a basketball floor and a secondary volleyball arena for intercollegiate competition with four recreational courts for basketball or volleyball. Adjoining facilities include intramural soccer, football, softball fields, and intercollegiate fields and courts for baseball, softball, field hockey, and tennis. The Patrick D. Cupp Stadium adds an intercollegiate soccer, lacrosse, and track and field complex.

<doc id="184607" wikidata="Q402342" url="?curid=184607" title="Aho–Corasick algorithm">
<text>In computer science, the Aho–Corasick algorithm is a string-searching algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick in 1975. It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the &quot;dictionary&quot;) within an input text. It matches all strings simultaneously. The complexity of the algorithm is linear in the length of the strings plus the length of the searched text plus the number of output matches. Because all matches are found, multiple matches will be returned for one string location if multiple strings from the dictionary match at that location (e.g. dictionary = , , , and input string is ).

Informally, the algorithm constructs a finite-state machine that resembles a trie with additional links between the various internal nodes. These extra internal links allow fast transitions between failed string matches (e.g. a search for in a trie that does not contain , but contains , and thus would fail at the node prefixed by ), to other branches of the trie that share a common suffix (e.g., in the previous case, a branch for might be the best lateral transition). This allows the automaton to transition between string matches without the need for backtracking.

When the string dictionary is known in advance (e.g. a computer virus database), the construction of the automaton can be performed once off-line and the compiled automaton stored for later use. In this case, its run time is linear in the length of the input plus the number of matched entries.

The Aho—Corasick string-matching algorithm formed the basis of the original Unix command fgrep.

==Example==
In this example, we will consider a dictionary consisting of the following words: {a, ab, bab, bc, bca, c, caa}.

The graph below is the Aho–Corasick data structure constructed from the specified dictionary, with each row in the table representing a node in the trie, with the column path indicating the (unique) sequence of characters from the root to the node.

The data structure has one node for every prefix of every string in the dictionary. So if (bca) is in the dictionary, then there will be nodes for (bca), (bc), (b), and (). If a node is in the dictionary then it is a blue node. Otherwise it is a grey node.

There is a black directed &quot;child&quot; arc from each node to a node whose name is found by appending one character. So there is a black arc from (bc) to (bca).

There is a blue directed &quot;suffix&quot; arc from each node to the node that is the longest possible strict suffix of it in the graph. For example, for node (caa), its strict suffixes are (aa) and (a) and (). The longest of these that exists in the graph is (a). So there is a blue arc from (caa) to (a). The blue arcs can be computed in linear time by performing a breadth-first search [potential suffix node will always be at lower level] starting from the root. The target for the blue arc of a visited node can be found by following its parent&#x27;s blue arc to its longest suffix node and searching for a child of the suffix node whose character matches that of the visited node. If the character does not exist as a child, we can find the next longest suffix (following the blue arc again) and then search for the character. We can do this until we either find the character (as child of a node) or we reach the root (which will always be a suffix of every string).

There is a green &quot;dictionary suffix&quot; arc from each node to the next node in the dictionary that can be reached by following blue arcs. For example, there is a green arc from (bca) to (a) because (a) is the first node in the dictionary (i.e. a blue node) that is reached when following the blue arcs to (ca) and then on to (a). The green arcs can be computed in linear time by repeatedly traversing blue arcs until a blue node is found, and memoizing this information.



At each step, the current node is extended by finding its child, and if that doesn&#x27;t exist, finding its suffix&#x27;s child, and if that doesn&#x27;t work, finding its suffix&#x27;s suffix&#x27;s child, and so on, finally ending in the root node if nothing&#x27;s seen before.

When the algorithm reaches a node, it outputs all the dictionary entries that end at the current character position in the input text. This is done by printing every node reached by following the dictionary suffix links, starting from that node, and continuing until it reaches a node with no dictionary suffix link. In addition, the node itself is printed, if it is a dictionary entry.

Execution on input string yields the following steps:

==Dynamic search list==

The original Aho–Corasick algorithm assumes that the set of search strings is fixed. It does not directly apply to applications in which new search strings are added during application of the algorithm. An example is an interactive indexing program, in which the user goes through the text and highlights new words or phrases to index as they see them. Bertrand Meyer introduced an incremental version of the algorithm in which the search string set can be incrementally extended during the search, retaining the algorithmic complexity of the original.

<text>CSS &quot;Grampus&quot; was a stern-wheel river steamer built in 1856 at McKeesport, Pennsylvania, for civilian employment. Taken by the Confederate Army in early 1862, she served as a scout boat and transport on the Mississippi River. Late in March 1862, Captain Marsh Miller in command, she took an active part in the defense of Island No. 10 where the Confederates finally sank her to prevent capture, on 7 April. The Union Gunboat Flotilla set out to raise her during May 1862 and did so, but she is believed to be the &quot;Grampus No. 2&quot; which burned the following 11 January.

<text>William Charles Norris (July 14, 1911, near Red Cloud, Nebraska – August 21, 2006) was an American business executive. He was the CEO of Control Data Corporation, at one time one of the most powerful and respected computer companies in the world. He is famous for taking on IBM in a head-on fight and winning, as well as being a social activist who used Control Data&#x27;s expansion in the late 1960s to bring jobs and training to inner cities and disadvantaged communities.

==Early life==
Norris was born and raised on a cattle farm in Nebraska, attending a tiny school in Inavale, Nebraska, and operating a ham radio. He attained a degree in electrical engineering from the University of Nebraska in 1932. He spent two years on his family&#x27;s farm after graduation, helping weather the Great Depression and a significant drought in the Midwest by risking the use of Russian thistle as cattle feed. 

==Military career==
Norris served in the United States Navy as a codebreaker, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander while working at the Navy&#x27;s Nebraska Avenue Complex in Washington, D.C. His technical accomplishments included advancing methods for identifying U-boats.

==Professional career==
Before entering military service, Norris sold X-Ray equipment for the Westinghouse Corporation in Chicago, then worked for the Bureau of Ordnance as a civil servant engineer until signing with the Naval Reserve.

Norris entered the computer business just after World War II, when along with Howard Engstrom and other US Navy cryptographers he formed Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in January, 1946 to build scientific computers. He hired forty of the members of his codebreaking team and set up shop in a glider factory with Northwestern Aeronautical, a major government contractor. ERA was fairly successful, but in the early 1950s a lengthy series of government probes into &quot;Navy funding&quot; drained the company and it was sold to Remington Rand. They operated within Remington Rand as a separate division for a time, but during the later merger with &quot;Sperry Corporation&quot; that formed &quot;Sperry Rand&quot;, their division was merged with UNIVAC. This resulted in most of ERA&#x27;s work being dropped. As a result, several employees left and set up Control Data, unanimously selecting Norris as president.

Control Data started by selling magnetic drum memory systems to other computer manufacturers, but introduced their own mainframe, the CDC 1604, in 1958. Designed primarily by Seymour Cray, the company soon followed the 1604 with a series of increasingly powerful machines. In 1965 they introduced the CDC 6600, the first supercomputer, and CDC was suddenly in the leadership position with a machine ten times faster than anything on the market.

This was a significant threat to IBM&#x27;s business, and they quickly started a project of their own to take back the performance crown from CDC. In the meantime they announced an advanced version of the IBM System/360, called the ACS-1, that was to be faster than the 6600. However, the machine didn&#x27;t yet exist, and after carefully documenting sales lost to the IBM project, Norris launched a massive lawsuit against them in 1968. IBM was unable to finish its &quot;6600 killer,&quot; and CDC eventually won the suit, and was awarded $600 million in damages.

In 1967 Norris attended a seminar for CEOs where Whitney Young, head of the National Urban League, spoke about the social and economic injustices in the lives of young black Americans. This speech, along with a summer of violence in Norris&#x27;s hometown of Minneapolis, greatly disturbed him. He became a champion of moving factories into the inner-cities, providing stable incomes and &quot;high-tech&quot; training to thousands of people who would otherwise have little chance at either.

Another CDC project that Norris championed was the PLATO system, an online teaching and instruction system developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The university developed most of the system on a CDC-1604 machine driving graphics terminals of their own design. In 1974 they reached an agreement with CDC to allow CDC to sell PLATO in exchange for free machines on which to run it. PLATO was released in 1975, but saw almost no use due to its high costs and complex maintenance. In the end PLATO did see some use as an employee training tool in large companies, but was never a success in the education market.

Norris continually purchased new companies to fold into CDC, and eventually returned to the peripheral market in the 1970s. This move proved particularly wise. During the early 1970s, Seymour Cray left to form his own company, which quickly drove CDC out of its leadership position in the supercomputer market. This left CDC in second place in a market for a small number of machines. Soon large Japanese companies were gobbling up what Cray didn&#x27;t. CDC tried to regain its footing in the supercomputer market by spinning off ETA Systems, in order to allow the developers to escape an increasingly ossified management structure inside CDC. However this effort failed and CDC gave up on the market entirely.

In the 1980s CDC was left primarily as a hard disk manufacturer, and their series of SCSI drives were particularly successful. But at this point the rest of the company crashed, and the board started pressuring Norris to step down. They were particularly harsh in blaming his social programs for their problems, although any connection is difficult, if not impossible, to find. He eventually realized there was little he could do to stop this course of action, and started an effort to place the company under the leadership of two hand-picked replacements. The stockholders didn&#x27;t go along with this, and Norris subsequently retired in January 1986. His successor as Control Data CEO was Robert M. Price.

William Norris died on August 21, 2006, in a nursing home in Bloomington, Minnesota, after a long battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He was survived by his wife Jane Malley Norris, eight children, sons William, George, Daniel, Brian, Roger and David, and daughters Constance Van Hoven and Mary Keck, 21 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

<doc id="184613" wikidata="Q7806247" url="?curid=184613" title="Timeline of the 2003 invasion of Iraq">
<text>This is a timeline of the events surrounding the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
==March 16==
* U.S. Special Operations Forces enter Iraq on long-range desert mobility missions to infiltrate into the country and raid key objectives along the border with Saudi Arabia.

==March 17==
* U.S. President George W. Bush delivers a televised address to the world, in which he summarizes the past few months&#x27; events between the United States and Iraq. He demands that Saddam Hussein vacate his office and leave Iraq within two days, or else the U.S. and its allies will invade Iraq and depose his regime.
* In the United Kingdom, Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook resigns in protest of Prime Minister Tony Blair&#x27;s support of the American invasion.

==March 18==
Protests against a possible invasion of Iraq begin to take place around the world.
* In Australia, a &quot;NO WAR&quot; slogan is painted on the Sydney Opera House by protesters. This comes as Australia&#x27;s Prime Minister John Howard announced he will commit troops to any American-led war against Iraq. A former Navy officer burns his uniform outside Australia&#x27;s Parliament House.
* In Denmark, protestors hurl red paint at Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen for his pro-U.S. stance shortly before a press conference. 
* In the United Kingdom, Tony Blair survives a rebellion within his own party to win parliamentary support of war actions in Iraq, in which 159 Labour Members of Parliament vote against the government.

==March 19==
*As anti-war protests continue, Greenpeace demonstrators chain themselves to the gates of the Australian prime minister&#x27;s residence, The Lodge.

==March 20==

The first assaults on Baghdad begin shortly following the 01:00 UTC expiry of the United States&#x27; 48-hour deadline for Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq.
*02:30 UTC: Explosions are reported in Baghdad, damaging civilian buildings. The United States Department of Defense later states that the assault consisted of 36 Tomahawk missiles and two F-117-launched GBU-27 bombs, and that the target was a military bunker thought to contain high-level Iraqi regime officials, including Saddam Hussein himself. Later, on May 29, CBS Evening News reports that the bunker never existed.
*03:15 UTC (March 19 U.S. time): U.S. President George W. Bush states that he ordered the coalition to launch an &quot;attack of opportunity&quot; against specified targets in Iraq. The military action was dubbed &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;.
*Iraqi state television broadcasts an address from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. and the British analyze the footage closely, believing that one of his body doubles may have made the speech. However, the U.S. eventually says it believes the address was indeed delivered by Saddam Hussein himself. It has not yet been ascertained when the address was recorded, however. Speculation begins that Saddam Hussein may have been killed. However, these reports are deemed to be false.
*It is announced that special operations forces are operating inside Iraq. Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States all have special operations forces in the area. Soon after the strike on Baghdad, Iraq launches a number of missiles at targets in Kuwait, including at the coalition forces stationed there. 2-3 Scud missiles are also intercepted. The coalition report that they caused no damage. Later in the day, both British and U.S. ground troops move into the demilitarized zone between Iraq and its neighbor, Kuwait, and then into Iraq itself. During the night, 12 British military personnel and four American troops are killed when a transport helicopter crashes.

==March 22==
*Airstrikes on Baghdad continue, with the attacks now concentrated on the city&#x27;s outskirts.
*Around midnight UTC (early morning local time), reports indicate that 1,500 Turkish troops had moved into northern Iraq. The intervention of Turkish troops had been opposed by the U.S. government. The German government has announced that it will call back the German AWACS personnel watching NATO airspace above Turkey if Turkish troops engage in fights in northern Iraq. Turkey later denies they moved troops into Iraq.
*At 1:15 (UTC), a collision of two Royal Navy Westland Sea King helicopters from over the Persian Gulf kills six Britons and one American.
*At 10:00 UTC, it is reported that U.S. forces are attempting to capture the city of Basra, and are involved in a major tank battle on the western side of the city.
*Kurdish officials report a U.S. missile attack on territory held by the Kurdish Islamist group Ansar al-Islam.
*According to Iraqi regime reports, two civilians are killed and 207 wounded, consisting of mostly women and children. They claim that there have been no defections or surrenders of Iraqi soldiers, and that footage to the contrary is in fact that of kidnapped Iraqi civilians.
*Five U.S. tanks and numerous vehicles have been destroyed by Iraqi fighters, and coalition forces enter but are later repelled from Umm Qasr.
*The Iraqi regime puts a bounty of 50 million dinars (US$33,000) for the capture, or 25 million dinars for the killing of each &quot;mercenary&quot;.
*Parts of the city of Basra are entered by the British.
*A hand grenade attack on a rear base of the 101st Airborne Division in Kuwait causes the death of CPT Chris Seifert of the Army and MAJ Gregory Stone of the Air Force and injuries to 14 others. An American soldier, SGT Hasan Akbar is arrested for the attack.

== March 23 ==
*American and British forces succeed in taking the airport outside of Basra, and battle with Iraqi forces for control of the city itself.
*U.S. Marines battle Iraqi forces near the city of Nassiriya, a key crossing of the Euphrates about southeast of Baghdad.
*News media report that pictures of British and American soldiers wounded and killed by Iraqi forces were shown by the Arabian Al Jazeera TV network.
**Sixteen Americans go missing; five of them were shown on Iraqi state-run television as prisoners of war and at least four are shown dead in what appears to be a hospital room.
*In another incident about ten U.S. Marines are confirmed to be killed, after they ran into an ambush during the Battle of Nasiriyah.
*The British television network ITV reports that its reporter Terry Lloyd was killed near Basra.
*The battles around the Iraqi cities of Basra and Nassiriya continue.
*Iraq reports that it has captured a number of American prisoners of war. The United States military states that 12 soldiers from a maintenance unit are missing. A videotape of the captured and dead soldiers are released, showing possible torture and execution-style killings. U.S. officials charge that Iraqi treatment of the captives violates the Geneva Conventions.
*A RAF Panavia Tornado is shot down by &quot;friendly fire&quot; by an American Patriot missile battery.
*Coalition forces take control of a large complex of buildings in An Najaf Province near the city of Najaf. Some news sources proclaim that this is a &quot;huge chemical weapons plant&quot;, but Pentagon officials call such announcements &quot;premature&quot; and state that no weapons of mass destruction had yet been found.
* In Belgium, legal complaints are filed against American officials for &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. It was reported that an Iraqi representing seven families deposited complaints for violation of human rights against former U.S. President George H. W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Norman Schwarzkopf in Belgium. Supported by a socialist deputy and a non-governmental organization (NGO), the Iraqis denounce the bombing of a shelter which had made 403 civilian victims in Baghdad in February 1991 during the Persian Gulf War. This is made possible by the Belgian law of universal competence, which provides justice on war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, and can apply to any nationalities. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell indicates the event was a &quot;serious problem&quot;, affecting the ability to go to Belgium, in particular to NATO in Brussels. Powell stated that this law was a subject of worry.

== March 24 ==
*An operation of about thirty American attack helicopters attack the Medina Division of the Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched in the Karbala area. One U.S. Army Apache helicopter is shot down and captured by Iraqi civilians, along with its two crewmen, who appear later on Arab satellite TV channels. A CNN reporter that was embedded with a helicopter unit that participated in the battle reports the destruction of another helicopter and that helicopters were under heavy fire, with only two of them managing to achieve their objectives. The helicopter&#x27;s crewmen are later safely recovered.
*China gives the United States the address of its embassy in Baghdad in hopes of avoiding a repeat of the deadly attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
*Five people, including one woman, are killed when a missile falls down onto their houses in a populated district in the west of Baghdad.
*The United States accuses the Russians of deliveries of weapons to Iraq. Ari Fleischer, the spokesman of the U.S. president, rejects denials by Moscow and claims that Washington has &quot;evidence&quot; of these deliveries, which could give the Iraqis invaluable assets against British and American forces. Devices listed are binoculars for night vision, GPS units, and anti-tank missiles. Fleischer says the U.S. government asked the Russians to immediately put an end to its assistance. The Russian government and the companies mentioned as having delivered armaments to Iraq rejects these allegations on Monday, describing them as &quot;inventions&quot; and reaffirming that Moscow strictly respects the embargo imposed by the U.N. on Baghdad. Russian President Vladimir Putin rejects the American charges himself during a telephone conversation with George W. Bush, the U.S. presidential press secretary indicated Tuesday, quoted by the Interfax agency.
* The Arab League votes 21–1 in favor of a resolution demanding the immediate and unconditional removal of U.S. and British soldiers from Iraq. The lone dissenting vote was cast by Kuwait.
*Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein gives a televised address on Iraqi state television, urging Iraqi citizens to fight coalition forces:
Oh, brave fighters! Hit your enemy with all your strength. Oh Iraqis, fight with the strength of the spirit of jihad which you carry in you and push them to the point where they cannot go on.

==March 25==
*Coalition forces begin fighting Iraqi militia in Basra, the second largest city in Iraq. British soldiers reported that the Shiite population of Basra appeared to be rebelling against the Iraqi militia. The anti-Saddam resistance group based in Iran, the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, confirmed that the Shiite revolt was taking place in Basra. According to some sources, the Iraqi militia forces were attacking the local Basra civilians, attempting to stop the revolt, with artillery and mortars. The Iraqi Information Minister Muhammed al-Sahhaf denied that any uprising was taking place in Basra.
*The Red Cross warned that a humanitarian crisis was emerging in the city. The Red Cross, Save the Children and other organizations are attempting to reach the city. Kuwait also has a caravan of supply trucks heading north into Iraq. Coalition forces announce that the port city of Umm Qasr was now &quot;safe and open&quot; and divers begin searching for mines off shore. Once the waters are clear, British ships, which are waiting off of the Iraqi coast, land in Umm Qasr with additional medicine, food and water for the area. Coalition forces have a small supply of food and water that they begin to pass out to the citizens of Umm Qasr.
*While fighting in Nasiriya, coalition forces discover and confiscate weapons caches and gear to protect against chemical weapons, including a T-55 tank, over 3,000 chemical suits with masks, and Iraqi munitions and military uniforms. All of this equipment was hidden in a Nasiriya hospital.
* U.S. forces advance toward Baghdad, but are hampered by extreme dust storms.
* Thousands of chemical suits as well as a tank and a large stockpile of weapons are reportedly found by coalition forces in the An Nasiriyah hospital in Iraq. Coalition forces enter the hospital after being fired upon by Iraqi soldiers hiding in the building. U.S. officials report the possibility that chemical weapons would be deployed on coalition troops as they approach Baghdad.
* British forces report that a popular uprising in the city of Basra has provoked Iraqi troops to fire upon civilians with mortars. British forces attack the mortar position.
*According to a U.S. officer, approximately 650 Iraqis were killed around Najaf &quot;in the last twenty-four hours&quot; while the American forces would not have, on their side, recorded any casualties. This assessment, not confirmed by any independent source, would be the heaviest since the beginning of the offensive, the Thursday prior.

== March 26 ==
* The American central command in Qatar admits to have carried out bombardments which could have killed civilians because Iraqi military assets were being placed close to civilian areas - within 300 feet (100 m) in some cases. This occurs a few hours after two explosions occurred in on a commercial street of Baghdad which killed 14 Iraqi civilians and injured thirty more, according to Iraqi civil defense. Also on this day special units of the Iraqi Republican Guard, for the first time, take part in the fights against the American and British forces. Just after the marketplace explosions in Baghdad, Russia calls for &quot;the immediate end of the war against Iraq&quot; and discussions to resume within the Security Council.
* 954 soldiers from the American 173rd Airborne Brigade, commanded by Colonel William C. Mayville, conduct a combat parajump into Northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield. Their mission is to secure a northern front to air-land ground units including armor and logistical assets. The paratroopers also assist special operations forces (SOF) already active in the areas north of Kirkuk and Mosul.

==March 27==
* U.S. forces take the bridge at Samawah.

==March 28==
*The U.N. Security Council unanimously adopts a resolution allowing the resumption of the Oil for Food program, suspended on March 18, and which 60% of the Iraqi population relies upon for sustenance. The Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, underlines that this vote should not be confused with a recognition of the war carried out and with a way to legitimize the military action afterwards. The resolution states that the chief responsibility for addressing humanitarian consequences of the war would fall to the United States and the United Kingdom if they take control of the country. This refers to the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, which defines the responsibilities of a country in wartime to occupying forces.
* U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld accuses Syria of supplying arms and materiel to Iraq; Syria denies these allegations.
* The first coalition forces humanitarian aid ship, the RFA &quot;Sir Galahad&quot;, prepares to dock at the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr at 11:45 p.m. (UTC).

==March 29==
*The Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf accuses U.S. forces of killing 140 civilians during the last 24 hours and denies allegations that Iraqi soldiers are disguising themselves as civilians.
*An explosion damaged a shopping center in Kuwait City before dawn. Initial reports suggest the cause is a malfunctioning U.S. cruise missile, but later reports focused on an Iraqi Silkworm missile as being responsible. No injuries are reported.
*An Iraqi suicide bomber, driving a taxi, kills four U.S. soldiers, Sgt Eugene Williams, Cpl Michael &quot;Jersey&quot; Curtain, PFC Michael Creighton, and PFC Diego Rincon.

==March 31==
* U.S. forces kill seven civilians, including women and children, in an automobile whose driver allegedly did not slow down at a checkpoint. According to a U.S. official, the family, which was probably trying to flee, did not stop after U.S. forces fired several shots above the car, and then into the car&#x27;s radiator.
* Journalist Peter Arnett is fired by NBC after giving an interview to Iraqi television, which some considered as unfairly critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s war on Iraq. Later in the day, Arnett was hired by a British tabloid, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;.
* The U.S. Department of Defense orders Fox News embedded reporter Geraldo Rivera away from its troops and demands him to leave Iraq after accusing him of reporting the positions of U.S. forces.

== April 2 ==

*U.S. forces reach the outskirts of Baghdad and encounter fierce fighting from small units of Iraqi Republican Guard.
*Kurdish militiamen, aided by U.S. forces, move into Kanilan near Mosul in northern Iraq. Citizens living in the town tell reporters that they are happy that the Iraqi soldiers are gone.

== April 3 ==
*U.S. forces take control of Saddam International Airport, in southern Baghdad. They rename the airport to &quot;Baghdad International Airport&quot;.

== April 4 ==
*MSNBC finds evidence of the deadly toxins ricin, and botulinum at a laboratory in northern Iraq, used as a training camp for Ansar al-Islam, a terrorist group with ties to the al-Qaida terrorist network. The tests conducted by MSNBC were the same type of tests used by U.N. weapons inspectors. U.S. officials said that they planned on conducting their own tests of the area.
*Saddam Hussein appears on Iraqi TV for the final time as the country&#x27;s head of state.
*U.S. forces search the Latifiyah Explosives and Ammunition Plant, south of Baghdad, and discover thousands of boxes full of vials of a white powdery substance, atropine (a nerve agent antidote) and Arabic documents on how to engage in chemical warfare. Early reports suggest that the powdery substance is an explosive, although additional tests are needed. Some vials contained a liquid. The facility had been identified by the International Atomic Energy Agency as a suspected chemical, biological and nuclear weapons site. U.N. weapons inspectors visited the plant at least nine times, including as recently as February 18. Later tests show no forbidden weaponry.

==April 6==
*Basra becomes the first major Iraqi city to be captured by coalition forces when it comes under British control.

==April 8 ==
*The International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s chief, Mohamed ElBaradei, reiterates a statement he made on March 31 that only the IAEA has a mandate to search for and destroy any nuclear weapons or parts of nuclear weapons that are found in Iraq.
* Two American air to surface missiles hit Al Jazeera&#x27;s office in Baghdad, killing a reporter and wounding a cameraman. The nearby office of Arab satellite TV channel Abu Dhabi is also hit by air strikes. Al-Jazeera accuses the U.S. of attacking civilian media as censorship. On the same day, an American M1 Abrams main battle tank fires into the fifteenth floor of Baghdad&#x27;s Palestine Hotel, where many foreign journalists are berthed, killing two cameramen and wounding three. In the case of Abu Dhabi, the station airs footage of Iraqi fire coming from underneath the camera&#x27;s viewpoint. In the hotel&#x27;s case, however, other journalists on the scene deny any fire from or around the hotel.

==April 9 ==
*Baghdad is captured by U.S. forces. Some Iraqis cheer in the streets as U.S. forces capture deserted Ba&#x27;ath Party ministry buildings and pull down a huge iron statue of Saddam Hussein, ending his 24-year rule of Iraq. Looting of government offices breaks out and forces fighting for Hussein melt away in large portions of the city.

==April 11==
*Mosul and Kirkuk captured by American and Kurdish forces.

==April 12==
*Looting and unrest, especially in major cities such as Baghdad and Basra becomes a very serious issue. In Baghdad, with the notable exception of the Oil Ministry, which was guarded by American soldiers, the majority of government and public buildings are totally plundered, to the point where there is nothing of any value left. This includes the National Museum of Iraq, with initial reports stating that 170,000 artifacts have been lost. The reports are later discovered to have been exaggerated, with the actual losses ultimately being determined to have been around 15,000 items. Many major hospitals are also looted. The losses caused by looting and plundering starts to cause more and more damage to Iraqi civilian infrastructure, economy, and culture, than those caused by three weeks of coalition bombing.

==April 13==
*Tikrit, the home town of Saddam Hussein, and the last town not under control of the coalition, was taken by the Marines of Task Force Tripoli. Perhaps to the surprise of many, there was little resistance.

*With the capture of the Tikrit region, the coalition declares that the war in Iraq is effectively over.

==May 1==
*U.S. President George W. Bush announces from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier , that major combat operations by the U.S. in Iraq &quot;have ended&quot;.

<text>Sophie Aldred (born 20 August 1962) is an English actress and television presenter. She has worked extensively in children&#x27;s television as a presenter and voice artist. She played the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s companion, Ace, in the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during the late 1980s, becoming the final companion in the series&#x27; first run.

==Early life==
Aldred was born on 20 August 1962 in Greenwich, London, but grew up in nearby Blackheath. She sang in the church choir of St James&#x27;, Kidbrooke, and attended Blackheath High School from 1973 until 1980. She then enrolled as a drama student at the University of Manchester. She graduated in 1983 and embarked on a career in children&#x27;s theatre. She also sang in working men&#x27;s clubs around Manchester.

==Career==
In 1987, Aldred was cast as Ace in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, initially for &quot;Dragonfire&quot;, the final story of the twenty-fourth season. Her tenure on the show spanned the last nine stories of the programme&#x27;s original run, which ended in 1989.

In January 1992, she guest-starred in &quot;More than a Messiah&quot;, one of the videos in the series &quot;The Stranger&quot;, starring Colin Baker, also formerly of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Both before and since &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Aldred has had a varied and busy television career, particularly in children&#x27;s programming, where she has presented educational programmes under the name &quot;Sophie Socket&quot; such as &quot;Corners&quot;, &quot;Melvin and Maureen&#x27;s Music-a-grams&quot; (which ran from 1992 to &#x27;96), Tiny and Crew (which she presented, 1995–96), the BBC series &quot;Words and Pictures&quot; (1992, 1996-2001), and also the CITV paranormal show &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot; in 1996.

Aldred has presented and sung in several BBC Schools Radio series, including &quot;Singing Together&quot;, &quot;Music Workshop&quot;, &quot;Time and Tune&quot; and &quot;Music Box&quot;. She has also performed on radio and in the theatre. She has also reprised her role as Ace in the 1993 thirtieth-anniversary charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot; and, since 2000, the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions. Following the start of rumours in 1994 and 1995, avid &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans expressed hope that Aldred would reprise her role in the project that would become the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie, but she did not appear, and her character&#x27;s fate was not mentioned.

Throughout the 2000s she has worked extensively as a voice-over artist for television advertisements, and has also provided voices for animated series such as &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Stripes&quot;, the UK dubbed version of the CGI animated version of the Australian TV series &quot;Bananas in Pyjamas&quot;, &quot;El Nombre&quot;, &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Noddy in Toyland&quot;, &quot;The Magic Key&quot; and &quot;Dennis &amp; Gnasher&quot;.

Aldred provided voices for the 2009 series &quot;Dennis and Gnasher&quot;, including that of title character Dennis the Menace.

She was also a former presenter of the 1996 CITV Saturday morning magazine programme &quot;WOW!&quot;.

Since 2012 Aldred has provided the voice of Tom in &quot;Tree Fu Tom&quot;, a CBeebies series.

In November 2013 she appeared in the one-off fiftieth-anniversary comedy homage &quot;The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot&quot;. In 2018, Aldred reprised the role of Ace in an audio drama set during the first season of &quot;Class&quot;.

In 2019, Aldred reprised the role of Ace in a special announcement trailer for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Season 26 Blu-ray box set. That same year, she also appeared as Mistress Na in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Sil and the Devil Seeds of Arodor&quot;; a role for which she won Best Supporting Actress at the Accolade Competition in 2020.

In 2020, Aldred released the novel &quot;Doctor Who: At Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, where an older Ace (now a philanthropist) meets the Thirteenth Doctor and her companions while investigating an alien satellite.

Aldred reprised the role of Ace in the October 2022 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; BBC Centenary special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; alongside Janet Fielding as Tegan Jovankawho was also a companion of the Doctor during the series&#x27; original run and in the episode she reunites with Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor.

<doc id="184620" wikidata="Q347628" url="?curid=184620" title="Artabazos I of Phrygia">
<text>Artabazos (; 480 BC - 455 BC) was a Persian general in the army of Xerxes I, and later satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia (now northwest Turkey) under the Achaemenid dynasty, founder of the Pharnacid dynasty of satraps. He was the son of Pharnaces, who was the younger brother of Hystaspes, father of Darius I. Artabazos was therefore a first cousin of the great Achaemenid ruler Darius I.

==General in the Second Persian invasion of Greece==

Artabazus was one of the generals of Xerxes in the 480 BC Second Persian invasion of Greece, in command of the Parthians and the Chorasmians in the Achaemenid army. He was particularly in charge of the reserve forces guarding the route back to Asia, and responsible for suppressing a revolt in Potidaea.

The invasion ended the following year with the commander-in-chief Mardonius, ignoring advice from Artabazus and others, meeting the Greeks in pitched battle at the Battle of Plataea and being defeated (479 BC). The Greeks followed up their victory by sailing to Ionia, where they destroyed the garrisoning forces under Tigranes at Mycale in the same year.

Artabazus, however, had refrained from engaging his troops at the Battle of Plataea, and thus managed to lead the remnant portion of a greatly reduced Achaemenid army out of Greece and back to Ionia. According to Herodotus and Plutarch, this force consisted of 40,000 men. Herodotus claims that in Thessaly he did not reveal the defeat as he would have been attacked, but claimed he needed to go to Thrace on a special mission. He was able to return to Persian territory despite losing men in attacks in Thrace.

==Satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia==

As a reward, Artabazus was made satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia. He was already preceded in this role by several Achaemenid satraps: the first Achaemenid ruler of Hellespontine Phrygia had been Mitrobates ( 525–522 BC), who was appointed by Cyrus the Great and continued under Cambyses II. He was killed and his territory absorbed by the satrap of neighbouring Lydia, Oroetes. Following the reorganization of Darius I, Mitrobates was succeeded by Oebares II (c.493), son of Megabazus.

Artabazus was named satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia in 479 BC. He was the first official satrap of the Pharnacid dynasty, named after his illustrious father Pharnaces. This office was passed down to his descendants, down to the conquests of Alexander the Great.

==Egypt and Cyprus campaigns==

Artabazos, together with Megabyzus, then satrap of Syria, had command of the Persian armies sent to put down the revolt of Inarus in Egypt. They arrived in 456 BC, and within two years had put down the revolt, capturing Inarus and various Athenians supporting him. They then turned their attention to Cyprus, which was under attack by the Athenians, led by Cimon. Shortly afterwards hostilities between Persia and Athens ceased, called the peace of Callias.

===Origin of the Egyptian campaign===
When Xerxes I was assassinated in 465 BC, he was succeeded by his son Artaxerxes I, but several parts of the Achaemenid empire soon revolted, foremost of which were Bactria and Egypt. The Egyptian Inarus defeated the Persian satrap of Egypt Achaemenes, a brother of Artaxerxes, and took control of Lower Egypt. He contacted the Greeks, who were also officially still at war with Persia, and in 460 BC, Athens sent an expeditionary force of 200 ships and 6,000 heavy infantry to support Inarus. The Egyptian and Athenian troops defeated the local Persian troops of Egypt, and captured the city of Memphis, except for the Persian citadel which they besieged for several years.

===Siege of Memphis (459-455 BC)===
The Athenians and Egyptians had settled down to besiege the local Persian troops in Egypt, at the White Castle. The siege evidently did not progress well, and probably lasted for at least four years, since Thucydides says that their whole expedition lasted 6 years, and of this time the final 18 months was occupied with the Siege of Prosoptis.

According to Thucydides, at first Artaxerxes sent Megabazus to try and bribe the Spartans into invading Attica, to draw off the Athenian forces from Egypt. When this failed, he instead assembled a large army under Megabyzus, and dispatched it to Egypt. Diodorus has more or less the same story, with more detail; after the attempt at bribery failed, Artaxerxes put Megabyzus and Artabazus in charge of 300,000 men, with instructions to quell the revolt. They went first from Persia to Cilicia and gathered a fleet of 300 triremes from the Cilicians, Phoenicians and Cypriots, and spent a year training their men. Then they finally headed to Egypt. Modern estimates, however, place the number of Persian troops at the considerably lower figure of 25,000 men given that it would have been highly impractical to deprive the already strained satrapies of any more man power than that. Thucydides does not mention Artabazus, who is reported by Herodotus to have taken part in the second Persian invasion; Diodorus may be mistaken about his presence in this campaign. It is clearly possible that the Persian forces did spend some prolonged time in training, since it took four years for them to respond to the Egyptian victory at Papremis. Although neither author gives many details, it is clear that when Megabyzus finally arrived in Egypt, he was able to quickly lift the Siege of Memphis, defeating the Egyptians in battle, and driving the Athenians from Memphis.

===Siege of Prosopitis (455 BC)===
The Athenians now fell back to the island of Prosopitis in the Nile delta, where their ships were moored. There, Megabyzus laid siege to them for 18 months, until finally he was able to drain the river from around the island by digging canals, thus &quot;joining the island to the mainland&quot;. In Thucydides&#x27;s account the Persians then crossed over to the former island, and captured it. Only a few of the Athenian force, marching through Libya to Cyrene survived to return to Athens. In Diodorus&#x27;s version, however, the draining of the river prompted the Egyptians (whom Thucydides does not mention) to defect and surrender to the Persians. The Persians, not wanting to sustain heavy casualties in attacking the Athenians, instead allowed them to depart freely to Cyrene, whence they returned to Athens. Since the defeat of the Egyptian expedition caused a genuine panic in Athens, including the relocation of the Delian treasury to Athens, Thucydides&#x27;s version is probably more likely to be correct.

==Succession==
He was succeeded by his son, Pharnabazus I (fl. 455 BC - 430 BC), of whom little is known, and then by his grandson Pharnaces II of Phrygia (&quot;fl.&quot; 430 BC - 413 BC), who is known to have been satrap at the outset of the Peloponnesian War. Pharnaces was in turn succeeded by his son, Pharnabazus II (&quot;fl.&quot; 413 BC - 373 BC), who is well known for his rivalry with Tissaphernes and wars against the Spartans.

<text>A nonblocking minimal spanning switch is a device that can connect N inputs to N outputs in any combination. The most familiar use of switches of this type is in a telephone exchange. The term &quot;non-blocking&quot; means that if it is not defective, it can always make the connection. The term &quot;minimal&quot; means that it has the fewest possible components, and therefore the minimal expense.

Historically, in telephone switches, connections between callers were arranged with large, expensive banks of electromechanical relays, Strowger switches. The basic mathematical property of Strowger switches is that for each input to the switch, there is exactly one output. Much of the mathematical switching circuit theory attempts to use this property to reduce the total number of switches needed to connect a combination of inputs to a combination of outputs.

In the 1940s and 1950s, engineers in Bell Lab began an extended series of mathematical investigations into methods for reducing the size and expense of the &quot;switched fabric&quot; needed to implement a telephone exchange. One early, successful mathematical analysis was performed by Charles Clos (), and a switched fabric constructed of smaller switches is called a Clos network.

== Background: switching topologies ==

===The crossbar switch===
The crossbar switch has the property of being able to connect N inputs to N outputs in any one-to-one combination, so it can connect any caller to any non-busy receiver, a property given the technical term &quot;nonblocking&quot;. Being nonblocking it could always complete a call (to a non-busy receiver), which would maximize service availability.

However, the crossbar switch does so at the expense of using N2 (N squared) simple SPST switches. For large N (and the practical requirements of a phone switch are considered large) this growth was too expensive. Further, large crossbar switches had physical problems. Not only did the switch require too much space, but the metal bars containing the switch contacts would become so long that they would sag and become unreliable. Engineers also noticed that at any time, each bar of a crossbar switch was only making a single connection. The other contacts on the two bars were unused. This seemed to imply that most of the switching fabric of a crossbar switch was wasted.

The obvious way to emulate a crossbar switch was to find some way to build it from smaller crossbar switches. If a crossbar switch could be emulated by some arrangement of smaller crossbar switches, then these smaller crossbar switches could also, in turn be emulated by even smaller crossbar switches. The switching fabric could become very efficient, and possibly even be created from standardized parts. This is called a Clos network.

===Completely connected 3-layer switches===

The next approach was to break apart the crossbar switch into three layers of smaller crossbar switches. There would be an &quot;input layer&quot;, a &quot;middle layer&quot; and an &quot;output layer.&quot; The smaller switches are less massive, more reliable, and generally easier to build, and therefore less expensive.

A telephone system only has to make a one-to-one connection. Intuitively this seems to mean that the number of inputs and the number of outputs can always be equal in each subswitch, but intuition does not prove this can be done nor does it tell us how to do so. Suppose we want to synthesize a 16 by 16 crossbar switch. The design could have 4 subswitches on the input side, each with 4 inputs, for 16 total inputs. Further, on the output side, we could also have 4 output subswitches, each with 4 outputs, for a total of 16 outputs. It is desirable that the design use as few wires as possible, because wires cost real money. The least possible number of wires that can connect two subswitches is a single wire. So, each input subswitch will have a single wire to each middle subswitch. Also, each middle subswitch will have a single wire to each output subswitch.

The question is how many middle subswitches are needed, and therefore how many total wires should connect the input layer to the middle layer. Since telephone switches are symmetric (callers and callees are interchangeable), the same logic will apply to the output layer, and the middle subswitches will be &quot;square&quot;, having the same number of inputs as outputs.

The number of middle subswitches depends on the algorithm used to allocate connection to them. The basic algorithm for managing a three-layer switch is to search the middle subswitches for a middle subswitch that has unused wires to the needed input and output switches. Once a connectible middle subswitch is found, connecting to the correct inputs and outputs in the input and output switches is trivial.

Theoretically, in the example, only four central switches are needed, each with exactly one connection to each input switch and one connection to each output switch. This is called a &quot;minimal spanning switch,&quot; and managing it was the holy grail of the Bell Labs&#x27; investigations.

However, a bit of work with a pencil and paper will show that it is easy to get such a minimal switch into conditions in which no single middle switch has a connection to both the needed input switch and the needed output switch. It only takes four calls to partially block the switch. If an input switch is half-full, it has connections via two middle switches. If an output switch is also half full with connections from the other two middle switches, then there is no remaining middle switch which can provide a path between that input and output.

For this reason, a &quot;simply connected nonblocking switch&quot; 16x16 switch with four input subswitches and four output switches was thought to require 7 middle switches; in the worst case an almost-full input subswitch would use three middle switches, an almost-full output subswitch would use three different ones, and the seventh would be guaranteed to be free to make the last connection. For this reason, sometimes this switch arrangement is called a &quot;2&quot;n&quot;−1 switch&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of input ports of the input subswitches.

The example is intentionally small, and in such a small example, the reorganization does not save many switches. A 16×16 crossbar has 256 contacts, while a 16×16 minimal spanning switch has 4×4×4×3 = 192 contacts.

As the numbers get larger, the savings increase. For example, a 10,000 line exchange would need 100 million contacts to implement a full crossbar. But three layers of 100 100×100 subswitches would use only 300 10,000 contact subswitches, or 3 million contacts.

Those subswitches could in turn each be made of 3×10 10×10 crossbars, a total of 3000 contacts, making 900,000 for the whole exchange; that is a far smaller number than 100 million.

===Managing a minimal spanning switch===

The crucial discovery was a way to reorganize connections in the middle switches to &quot;trade wires&quot; so that a new connection could be completed.

The first step is to find an unused link from the input subswitch to a middle-layer subswitch (which we shall call A), and an unused link from a middle-layer subswitch (which we shall call B) to the desired output subswitch. Since, prior to the arrival of the new connection, the input and output subswitches each had at least one unused connection, both of these unused links must exist.

If A and B happen to be the &quot;same&quot; middle-layer switch, then the connection can be made immediately just as in the &quot;2&quot;n&quot;−1&quot; switch case. However, if A and B are &quot;different&quot; middle-layer subswitches, more work is required. The algorithm finds a new arrangement of the connections through the middle subswitches A and B which includes all of the existing connections, &quot;plus&quot; the desired new connection.

Make a list of all of the desired connections that pass through A or B. That is, all of the existing connections to be maintained &quot;and&quot; the new connection. The algorithm proper only cares about the internal connections from input to output switch, although a practical implementation also has to keep track of the correct input and output switch connections.

In this list, each input subswitch can appear in at most two connections: one to subswitch A, and one to subswitch B. The options are zero, one, or two. Likewise, each output subswitch appears in at most two connections.

Each connection is linked to at most two others by a shared input or output subswitch, forming one link in a &quot;chain&quot; of connections.

Next, begin with the new connection. Assign it the path from its input subswitch, through middle subswitch A, to its output subswitch. If this first connection&#x27;s output subswitch has a second connection, assign that second connection a path from its input subswitch through subswitch B. If that input subswitch has another connection, assign that third connection a path through subswitch A. Continue back and forth in this manner, alternating between middle subswitches A and B. Eventually one of two things must happen:
# the chain terminates in a subswitch with only one connection, or
# the chain loops back to the originally chosen connection.
In the first case, go back to the new connection&#x27;s input subswitch and follow its chain backward, assigning connections to paths through middle subswitches B and A in the same alternating pattern.

When this is done, each input or output subswitch in the chain has at most two connections passing through it, and they are assigned to different middle switches. Thus, all the required links are available.

There may be additional connections through subswitches A and B which are not part of the chain including the new connection; those connections may be left as-is.

After the new connection pattern is designed in the software, then the electronics of the switch can actually be reprogrammed, physically moving the connections. The electronic switches are designed internally so that the new configuration can be written into the electronics without disturbing the existing connection, and then take effect with a single logic pulse. The result is that the connection moves instantaneously, with an imperceptible interruption to the conversation. In older electromechanical switches, one occasionally heard a clank of &quot;switching noise.&quot;

This algorithm is a form of topological sort, and is the heart of the algorithm that controls a minimal spanning switch.

== Practical implementations of switches ==

As soon as the algorithm was discovered, Bell system engineers and managers began discussing it. After several years, Bell engineers began designing electromechanical switches that could be controlled by it. At the time, computers used tubes and were not reliable enough to control a phone system (phone system switches are safety-critical, and they are designed to have an unplanned failure about once per thirty years). Relay-based computers were too slow to implement the algorithm. However, the entire system could be designed so that when computers were reliable enough, they could be retrofitted to existing switching systems.

It&#x27;s not difficult to make composite switches fault-tolerant. When a subswitch fails, the callers simply redial. So, on each new connection, the software tries the next free connection in each subswitch rather than reusing the most recently released one. The new connection is more likely to work because it uses different circuitry.

Therefore, in a busy switch, when a particular PCB lacks any connections, it is an excellent candidate for testing.

To test or remove a particular printed circuit card from service, there is a well-known algorithm. As fewer connections pass through the card&#x27;s subswitch, the software routes more test signals through the subswitch to a measurement device, and then reads the measurement. This does not interrupt old calls, which remain working.

If a test fails, the software isolates the exact circuit board by reading the failure from several external switches. It then marks the free circuits in the failing circuitry as busy. As calls using the faulty circuitry are ended, those circuits are also marked busy. Some time later, when no calls pass through the faulty circuitry, the computer lights a light on the circuit board that needs replacement, and a technician can replace the circuit board. Shortly after replacement, the next test succeeds, the connections to the repaired subswitch are marked &quot;not busy,&quot; and the switch returns to full operation.

The diagnostics on Bell&#x27;s early electronic switches would actually light a green light on each good printed circuit board, and light a red light on each failed printed circuit board. The printed circuits were designed so that they could be removed and replaced without turning off the whole switch.

The eventual result was the Bell 1ESS. This was controlled by a CPU called the Central Control (CC), a lock-step, Harvard architecture dual computer using reliable diode–transistor logic. In the 1ESS CPU, two computers performed each step, checking each other. When they disagreed, they would diagnose themselves, and the correctly running computer would take up switch operation while the other would disqualify itself and request repair. The 1ESS switch was still in limited use as of 2012, and had a verified reliability of less than one unscheduled hour of failure in each thirty years of operation, validating its design.

Initially it was installed on long-distance trunks in major cities, the most heavily used parts of each telephone exchange. On the first Mother&#x27;s Day that major cities operated with it, the Bell system set a record for total network capacity, both in calls completed, and total calls per second per switch. This resulted in a record for total revenue per trunk.

==Digital switches==

A practical implementation of a switch can be created from an odd number of layers of smaller subswitches. Conceptually, the crossbar switches of the three-stage switch can each be further decomposed into smaller crossbar switches. Although each subswitch has limited multiplexing capability, working together they synthesize the effect of a larger &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; crossbar switch.

In a modern digital telephone switch, application of two different multiplexer approaches in alternate layers further reduces the cost of the switching fabric:

#space-division multiplexers are something like the crossbar switches already described, or some arrangement of crossover switches or banyan switches. Any single output can select from any input. In digital switches, this is usually an arrangement of AND gates. 8000 times per second, the connection is reprogrammed to connect particular wires for the duration of a time slot. Design advantage: In space-division systems the number of space-division connections is divided by the number of time slots in the time-division multiplexing system. This dramatically reduces the size and expense of the switching fabric. It also increases the reliability, because there are far fewer physical connections to fail.
#time-division multiplexers each have a memory which is read in a fixed order and written in a programmable order (or &quot;vice versa&quot;). This type of switch permutes time-slots in a time-division multiplexed signal that goes to the space-division multiplexers in its adjacent layers. Design advantage: Time-division switches have only one input and output wire. Since they have far fewer electrical connections to fail, they are far more reliable than space-division switches, and are therefore the preferred switches for the outer (input and output) layers of modern telephone switches.

Practical digital telephonic switches minimize the size and expense of the electronics. First, it is typical to &quot;fold&quot; the switch, so that both the input and output connections to a subscriber-line are handled by the same control logic. Then, a time-division switch is used in the outer layer. The outer layer is implemented in subscriber-line interface cards (SLICs) in the local presence street-side boxes. Under remote control from the central switch, the cards connect to timing-slots in a time-multiplexed line to a central switch. In the U.S. the multiplexed line is a multiple of a T-1 line. In Europe and many other countries it is a multiple of an E-1 line.

The scarce resources in a telephone switch are the connections between layers of subswitches. These connections can be either time slots or wires, depending on the type of multiplexing. The control logic has to allocate these connections, and the basic method is the algorithm already discussed. The subswitches are logically arranged so that they synthesize larger subswitches. Each subswitch, and synthesized subswitch is controlled (recursively) by logic derived from Clos&#x27;s mathematics. The computer code decomposes larger multiplexers into smaller multiplexers.

If the recursion is taken to the limit, breaking down the crossbar to the minimum possible number of switching elements, the resulting device is sometimes called a crossover switch or a banyan switch depending on its topology.

Switches typically interface to other switches and fiber optic networks via fast multiplexed data lines such as SONET.

Each line of a switch may be periodically tested by the computer, by sending test data through it. If a switch&#x27;s line fails, all lines of a switch are marked as in use. Multiplexer lines are allocated in a first-in-first out way, so that new connections find new switch elements. When all connections are gone from a defective switch, the defective switch can be avoided, and later replaced.

As of 2018, such switches are no longer made. They are being replaced by high-speed Internet Protocol routers.

<text>Michael Leunig (2 June 1945 – 19 December 2024), typically referred to by his pen name Leunig, was an Australian cartoonist, poet and artist. He was best known for his work for Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. 

Leunig&#x27;s works include &quot;The Curly Pyjama Letters&quot;, the cartoon books &quot;The Essential Leunig&quot;, &quot;The Wayward Leunig&quot;, &quot;The Stick&quot;, &quot;Goatperson&quot;, &quot;Short Notes from the Long History of Happiness&quot; and &quot;Curly Verse&quot; as well as &quot;The Lot&quot;, a compilation of his &quot;Curly World&quot; newspaper columns. Leunig also wrote several books of prayers, including &quot;A Common Prayer&quot;, &quot;The Prayer Tree&quot; and &quot;When I Talk To You&quot;.

Leunig was declared an Australian Living Treasure by the National Trust of Australia in 1999.

==Early life and education==
Leunig, a fifth-generation Australian, was born on 2 June 1945 in East Melbourne, the eldest of five children. He said he traced his family&#x27;s ancestry to the Harz, Holy Roman Empire (now Germany), in the 16th century. He grew up in Footscray, an inner western suburb of Melbourne, where he went to Footscray North Primary School. He then went to Maribyrnong High School, but as the school had not finished being built, he first had to attend classes held at the nearby Melbourne Showgrounds in Ascot Vale. He twice failed his final year examinations.

After working as a labourer in an abattoir, Leunig enrolled at the Swinburne Film and Television School, where he was at first interested in making documentaries. 

Leunig was conscripted in the Vietnam War call-up, but he registered as a conscientious objector; he was rejected on health grounds when it was revealed that he was deaf in one ear.

==Career==
Leunig began his cartoon career while studying at Swinburne in 1965 when his cartoons appeared in the Monash University student newspaper &quot;Lot&#x27;s Wife&quot;. In the early 1970s his work appeared in the radical/satirical magazines &quot;Nation Review&quot;, &quot;The Digger&quot; and London&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; magazine, as well as mainstream publications including &quot;Newsday&quot; and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot;. 

The main outlet for Leunig&#x27;s work was the daily Fairfax Media newspapers, Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation also provided airtime to Leunig to discuss his views on a range of political and philosophical issues.

Leunig continued to contribute cartoons for the Saturday edition of &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; until he was sacked in August 2024, along with a number of other staff, as a cost-cutting measure.

==Cartoons==
=== Style and themes ===
Leunig&#x27;s drawings were done with a sparse and quivering line, usually in black and white with ink wash; the human characters often drawn with exaggerated noses. This style served him well in his early years, when he gained a loyal following for his quirky take on social issues. He also made increasingly frequent forays into a personal fantasy world of whimsy, featuring small figures with teapots balanced on their heads, grotesquely curled hair and many ducks.

Leunig frequently satirised concepts such as Americanisation, greed, consumerism, corporations and warmongering, in a personal proclamation against the &quot;war on terror&quot;. Readers and critics took special note of his parodies of political matters, especially those concerning former Australian prime minister John Howard and former American president George W. Bush. These earned Leunig a description as a &quot;political cartoonist&quot;, although only some of his works were political in nature or reference. His work also frequently explored spiritual, religious and moral themes.

From a very early stage in his career, Leunig often included his own handwritten poetry within his cartoons; subsequently he also published books of poetry. He was very open about his themes in interviews about his work.

===Characters ===
In the series of cartoons that Leunig created, a number of characters persistently appeared, including:
* The Duck
* Mr Curly – a contented character who is at ease in the natural world
*Vasco Pyjama – a restless wanderer who sometimes seeks the counsel of Mr Curly 

===Controversial works===

Leunig&#x27;s cartoons were occasionally a source of controversy. A colleague referred to his return to political cartooning in the late 1990s as his &quot;Bob Dylan goes electric&quot; moment. In 2008, he wrote that &quot;Artists must never shrink from a confrontation with society or the state.&quot;

Leunig opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, commenting that &quot;if a cartoonist is representing the government line on Iraq, they&#x27;re nothing better than a propagandist&quot;.

In 2006, Fairfax Media partially censored a Leunig cartoon criticising the then prime minister, John Howard; the cartoon was published in Victoria but not in New South Wales.

Leunig stated his opposition to the Israeli government. Three of his cartoons between 2004 and 2006 drew letters of protest nationally and internationally. He partially defined his position in 2006, saying that the Israeli government had &quot;gravely mishandled&quot; the situation in Palestine, and &quot;it bothers me deeply. It is my right to express it.&quot;

A supposed Leunig cartoon came to international attention after it was entered in an Iranian competition conceived by the newspaper &quot;Hamshahri&quot; as retaliation for the Muhammad cartoons controversy. Leunig denied he had submitted the cartoon, and demanded that it be withdrawn, which it was. It later emerged that the cartoon had been submitted as a prank by Richard Cooke, a contributor to the Australian comedic team &quot;The Chaser&quot;.

In November 2018, Leunig&#x27;s 30-year association with the Melbourne Comedy Festival came to an end, after artists expressed concerns about being associated with Leunig&#x27;s anti-vaccination views and his opposition to the marriage equality plebiscite. Leunig had designed the logo for the festival each year since 1988.

In September 2021, Leunig&#x27;s cartoon contributions for the editorial page in the Monday edition of &quot;The Age&quot; were ended following the paper&#x27;s rejection for publication of a cartoon he had drawn in response to COVID-19 vaccination requirements in Australia. The cartoon compared resistance to vaccine requirements to the Tank Man in Tiananmen Square.

==Recognition and other activities==

In 1986, Leunig decorated a Melbourne tram with cartoon characters, sponsored by the Victorian Government.
In 1999, Leunig was declared an National Living Treasure by the National Trust of Australia. 

In 2006, Australian musician Gyan Evans released the album &quot;Billy the Rabbit&quot;, based on the poetry of Leunig. Gyan and Leunig launched the album at the Melbourne Writers Festival, with Leunig illustrating during Gyan&#x27;s singing. They also performed together at the Byron Writers Festival and the Sydney Opera House.

Leunig performed at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games, wearing a duck costume. That same year, for his work on &quot;Southern Star&quot;, Leunig was co-recipient of the 2006 APRA Music Award together with Christopher Willcock. 

In 2009, Leunig created an iGoogle theme.

In 2016, &quot;Metrosideros leunigii&quot;, the oldest described fossil species of the flowering plant genus &quot;Metrosideros&quot;, was named after Leunig. 

In 2020, Leunig was the winner of the Ernie Award for his cartoon of mothers &quot;being too busy on Instagram&quot;.

Several Leunig poems have been set to music by composers including Paul Stanhope, and, for the Song Company, the composers Alice Chance, Drew Crawford, James Wade, Kate Moore, Kate Neal, Katy Abbott, Lachlan Skipworth, Lyle Chan, Mark Viggiani, Robert Davidson and Ruth McCall.

==Personal life and death==
Leunig&#x27;s first marriage, to Pamela Munro, ended in divorce. He married his second wife, Helga, in 1992 but they separated in the 2010s. He was together with his last partner, Nicola Dierich, until his death. Leunig had four children. 

A documentary film about Leunig&#x27;s life by Kasimir Burgess, &quot;The Leunig Fragments&quot;, was released in 2020 and revealed various difficulties that he had experienced with family relationships. He did not attend his parents&#x27; funerals and was not in regular contact with his siblings.

Leunig&#x27;s sister, Mary Leunig, is also an accomplished cartoonist. In December 2019, she accused Leunig of sexually abusing her during childhood in a series of cartoons posted to her Facebook account.

Leunig had a studio in the Melbourne suburb of Northcote and a country property in north-east Victoria.

Leunig died in Melbourne, in the early hours of 19 December 2024, at the age of 79.

<text>Maya Deren (; born Eleonora Derenkovskaya; ; – October 13, 1961) was a Ukrainian-born American experimental filmmaker and important part of the avant-garde in the 1940s and 1950s. Deren was also a choreographer, dancer, film theorist, poet, lecturer, writer, and photographer.

The function of film, Deren believed, was to create an experience. She combined her expertise in dance and choreography, ethnography, the African spirit religion of Haitian Vodou, symbolist poetry and gestalt psychology (as a student of Kurt Koffka) in a series of perceptual, black-and-white short films. Using editing, multiple exposures, jump-cutting, superimposition, slow-motion, and other camera techniques to her advantage, Deren abandoned established notions of physical space and time, innovating through carefully planned films with specific conceptual aims.

&quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943), her collaboration with her husband at the time, Alexander Hammid, has been one of the most influential experimental films in American cinema history. Deren went on to make several more films, including but not limited to &quot;At Land&quot; (1944), &quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot; (1945), and &quot;Ritual in Transfigured Time&quot; (1946), writing, producing, directing, editing, and photographing them with help from only one other person, Hella Heyman, her camerawoman.

==Early life==
Deren was born in Kiev, into a Jewish family, to psychologist Solomon Derenkowsky and Gitel-Malka (Marie) Fiedler, who supposedly named their daughter after Italian actress Eleonora Duse.

In 1922, the family fled the Ukrainian SSR because of antisemitic pogroms perpetrated by the White Volunteer Army and moved to Syracuse, New York. Her father shortened the family name from Derenkovskaya to &quot;Deren&quot; shortly after they arrived in New York. He became the staff psychiatrist at the State Institute for the Feeble-Minded in Syracuse. Deren&#x27;s mother was a musician and dancer who had studied these arts in Kiev. In 1928, Deren&#x27;s parents became naturalized citizens of the United States.

Deren was highly intelligent, starting fifth grade at only eight years old. She attended the League of Nations International School of Geneva, Switzerland for high school from 1930 to 1933. Her mother moved to Paris, France to be nearer to her while she studied. Deren learned to speak French while she was abroad.

Deren enrolled at Syracuse University at sixteen, where she began studying journalism and political science. Deren became a highly active socialist activist during the Trotskyist movement in her late teens. She served as National Student Secretary in the National Student office of the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League and was a member of the Social Problems Club at Syracuse University.

At age eighteen in June 1935, she married Gregory Bardacke, a socialist activist whom she met through the Social Problems Club. After his graduation in 1935, she moved to New York City. She finished school at New York University with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in literature in June 1936, and returned to Syracuse that fall. She and Bardacke became active in various socialist causes in New York City; and it was during this time that they separated and eventually divorced three years later.

In 1938, Deren attended the New School for Social Research, and received a master&#x27;s degree in English literature at Smith College. Her Master&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;The Influence of the French Symbolist School on Anglo-American Poetry&quot; (1939). This included works of Pound, Eliot, and the Imagists. By the age of 21, Deren had earned two degrees in literature.

==Early career==
After graduation from Smith, Deren returned to New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village, where she joined the European émigré art scene. She supported herself from 1937 to 1939 by freelance writing for radio shows and foreign-language newspapers. During that time she also worked as an editorial assistant to famous American writers Eda Lou Walton, Max Eastman, and then William Seabrook. She wrote poetry and short fiction, tried her hand at writing a commercial novel, and also translated a work by Victor Serge which was never published. She became known for her European-style handmade clothes, wild red curly hair and fierce convictions.

In 1940, Deren moved to Los Angeles to focus on her poetry and freelance photography. In 1941, Deren wrote to Katherine Dunham—an African American dancer, choreographer, and anthropologist of Caribbean culture and dance—suggesting a children&#x27;s book on dance and applying for a managerial job for her and her dance troupe; she later became Dunham&#x27;s assistant and publicist. Deren travelled with the troupe for a year, learning greater appreciation for dance, as well as interest and appreciation for Haitian culture. Dunham&#x27;s fieldwork influenced Deren&#x27;s studies of Haitian culture and Vodou mythology. At the end of touring a new musical &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;, the Dunham dance company stopped in Los Angeles for several months to work in Hollywood. It was there that Deren met Alexandr Hackenschmied (who later changed his name to Alexander Hammid), a celebrated Czech-born photographer and cameraman who would become Deren&#x27;s second husband in 1942. Hackenschmied had fled from Czechoslovakia in 1938 after the Sudetenland crisis.

Deren and Hammid lived together in Laurel Canyon, where he helped her with her still photography which focused on local fruit pickers in Los Angeles. Of two still photography magazine assignments of 1943 to depict artists active in New York City, including Ossip Zadkine, her photographs appeared in the Vogue magazine article. The other article intended for Mademoiselle magazine was not published, but three signed enlargements of photographs intended for this article, all depicting Deren&#x27;s friend New York ceramist Carol Janeway, are preserved in the MoMA and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. All prints were from Janeway&#x27;s estate.

==Personal life==
In 1943, she moved to a bungalow on Kings Road in Hollywood and adopted the name Maya, a pet name her second husband Hammid coined. Maya is the name of the mother of the historical Buddha as well as the dharmic concept of the illusory nature of reality. In Greek myth, Maia is the mother of Hermes and a goddess of mountains and fields.

In 1944, back in New York City, her social circle included Marcel Duchamp, André Breton, John Cage, and Anaïs Nin. In 1944, Deren filmed &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Cradle&quot; in Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s Art of This Century gallery with Duchamp featured in the film.

In the December 1946 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, a caption for her photograph teased that she &quot;experiments with motion pictures of the subconscious, but here is finite evidence that the lady herself is infinitely photogenic.&quot; Her third husband, Teiji Itō, said: &quot;Maya was always a Russian. In Haiti she was a Russian. She was always dressed up, talking, speaking many languages and being a Russian.&quot;

==Film career==
Deren defined cinema as an art, provided an intellectual context for film viewing, and filled a theoretical gap for the kinds of independent films that film societies were featuring. As Sarah Keller states, “Maya Deren lays claim to the honor of being one of the most important pioneers of the American film avant-garde with a scant seventy-five or so minutes of finished films to her credit.”

Deren began to screen and distribute her films in the United States, Canada, and Cuba, lecturing and writing on avant-garde film theory, and additionally on Vodou. In February 1946 she booked the Provincetown Playhouse in Greenwich Village for a major public exhibition, titled &quot;Three Abandoned Films&quot;, in which she showed &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943), &quot;At Land&quot; (1944) and &quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot; (1945). The event was completely sold out, inspiring Amos Vogel&#x27;s formation of Cinema 16, the most successful film society of the 1950s.

In 1946, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for &quot;Creative Work in the Field of Motion Pictures&quot;, and in 1947, won the Grand Prix International for avant-garde film at the Cannes Film Festival for &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;. She then created a scholarship for experimental filmmakers, the Creative Film Foundation.

Between 1952 and 1955, Deren collaborated with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School and Antony Tudor to create &quot;The Very Eye of Night&quot;.

Deren&#x27;s background and interest in dance appears in her work, most notably in the short film &quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot; (1945). This combination of dance and film has often been referred to as &quot;choreocinema&quot;, a term first coined by American dance critic John Martin.

In her work, she often focused on the unconscious experience, such as in &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon.&quot; This is thought to be inspired by her father who was a student of psychiatrist Vladimir Bekhterev who explored trance and hypnosis as neurological states. She also regularly explored themes of gender identity, incorporating elements of introspection and mythology. Despite her feminist subtext, she was mostly unrecognized by feminist writers at the time, even influential writers Claire Johnston and Laura Mulvey ignored Deren at the time, though Mulvey later would give Deren this recognition, since their works were often in conversation with each other.

==Major films==

===&quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943)===


In 1943, Deren purchased a used 16mm Bolex camera with some of the inheritance money after her father&#x27;s death from a heart attack. This camera was used to make her first and best-known film, &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; (1943), made in collaboration with Hammid in their Los Angeles home on a budget of $250.&lt;ref name=&quot;Athology Film Archive/Film Culture&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; is recognized as a seminal American avant-garde film. Critics have seen autobiographical elements in the film, as well as thoughts about woman as subject rather than as object. Originally a silent film with no dialogue, music for the film was composed, long after its initial screenings, by Deren&#x27;s third husband Teiji Itō in 1952. The film can be described as an expressionistic &quot;trance film&quot;, full of dramatic angles and innovative editing. It investigates the ephemeral ways in which the protagonist&#x27;s unconscious mind works and makes connections between objects and situations. A woman, played by Maya Deren, walks up to a house in Los Angeles, falls asleep and seems to have a dream. The sequence of walking up to the gate on the partially shaded road restarts numerous times, resisting conventional narrative expectations, and ends in various situations inside the house. Movement from the wind, shadows and the music sustain the heartbeat of the dream. Recurring symbols include a cloaked figure, mirrors, a key, and a knife.

The loose repetition and rhythm cut short any expectation of a conventional narrative, heightening the dream-like qualities. The camera initially does not show her face, which precludes identification with a particular woman, which creates a universalizing, totalizing effect- as it is easier to relate to an unknown, faceless woman. Multiple selves appear, shifting between the first and third person, suggesting that the super-ego is at play, which is in line with the psychoanalytic Freudian staircase and flower motifs. This kind of Freudian interpretation, which she disagreed with, led Deren to add sound, composed by Teiji Itō, to the film.

Another interpretation is that each film is an example of a &quot;personal film&quot;. Her first film, &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;, explores a woman&#x27;s subjectivity and relation to the external world. Georges Sadoul said Deren may have been &quot;the most important figure in the post-war development of the personal, independent film in the U.S.A.&quot; In featuring the filmmaker as the woman whose subjectivity in the domestic space is explored, the feminist dictum &quot;the personal is political&quot; is foregrounded. As with her other films on self-representation, Deren navigates conflicting tendencies of the self and the &quot;other&quot;, through doubling, multiplication and merging of the woman in the film. Following a dreamlike quest with allegorical complexity, &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; has an enigmatic structure and a loose affinity with both film noir and domestic melodrama. The film is famous for how it resonated with Deren&#x27;s own life and anxieties. According to a review in &quot;The Moving Image&quot;, &quot;this film emerges from a set of concerns and passionate commitments that are native to Deren&#x27;s life and her trajectory. The first of these trajectories is Deren&#x27;s interest in socialism during her youth and university years&quot;.

==== Director&#x27;s notes ====
There is no concrete information about the conception of &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; beyond that Deren offered the poetic ideas and Hammid was able to turn them into visuals, as she envisioned them. Deren&#x27;s initial concept began on the terms of a subjective camera, one that would show the point of view of herself without the aid of mirrors and would move as her eyes through spaces. According to the earliest program note, she describes &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot; as follows:

This film is concerned with the interior experiences of an individual. It does not record an event which could be witnessed by other persons. Rather, it reproduces the way in which the subconscious of an individual will develop, interpret, and elaborate an apparently simple and casual incident into a critical emotional experience.

===&quot;At Land&quot; (1944)===


Deren filmed &quot;At Land&quot; in Port Jefferson and Amagansett, New York in the summer of 1944. Taking on more of an environmental psychologist&#x27;s perspective, Deren &quot;externalizes the hidden dynamic of the external world...as if I had moved from a concern with the life of the fish, to a concern with the sea which accounts for the character of the fish and its life.&quot; Maya Deren washes up on the shore of the beach, and climbs up a piece of driftwood that leads to a room lit by chandeliers, and one long table filled with men and women smoking. She seems to be invisible to the people as she crawls across the table, uninhibited; her body continues seamlessly again onto a new frame, crawling through foliage; following the flowing pattern of water on rocks; following a man across a farm, to a sick man in bed, through a series of doors, and finally popping up outside on a cliff. She shrinks in the wide frame as she walks farther away from the camera, up and down sand dunes, then frantically collecting rocks back on the shore. Her expression seems confused when she sees two women playing chess in the sand. She runs back through the entire sequence, and because of the jump-cuts, it seems as though she is a double or &quot;doppelganger&quot;, where her earlier self sees her other self running through the scene. Some of her movements are controlled, suggesting a theatrical, dancer-like quality, while some have an almost animalistic sensibility as she crawls through the seemingly foreign environments. This is one of Deren&#x27;s films in which the focus is on the character&#x27;s exploration of her own subjectivity in her physical environment, inside as well as outside her subconscious, although it has a similar amorphous quality compared to her other films.

===&quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot; (1945)===


In the spring of 1945 she made &quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot;, which Deren said was &quot;an effort to isolate and celebrate the principle of the power of movement.&quot; The compositions and varying speeds of movement within the frame inform and interact with Deren&#x27;s meticulous edits and varying film speeds and motions to create a dance that Deren said could only exist on film. Excited by the way the dynamic of movement is greater than anything else within the film, Maya established a completely new sense of the word &quot;geography&quot; as the movement of the dancer transcends and manipulates the ideas of both time and space. &quot;For Deren, no transition is needed between a place outside (such as a forest, or a park, or the beach) and an interior room. One action can be performed across different physical spaces, as in A Study in Choreography For Camera (1945), and in this way sews together layers of reality, thereby suggesting continuity between different levels of consciousness.&quot;At just under 3 minutes long, &quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot; is a fragment depicting a carefully constructed exploration of a man who dances in a forest, and then seems to teleport to the inside of a house because of how continuous his movements are from one place to the next. The edit is broken, choppy, showing different angles and compositions, and even with parts in slow-motion, Deren is able to keep the quality of the leap smooth and seemingly uninterrupted. The choreography is perfectly synched as he seamlessly appears in an outdoor courtyard and then returns to an open, natural space. It shows a progression from nature to the confines of society, and back to nature. The figure belongs to dancer and choreographer Talley Beatty, whose last movement is a leap across the screen back to the natural world. Deren and Beatty met through Katherine Dunham, while Deren was her assistant and Beatty was a dancer in her company. It is worth noting that Beatty collaborated heavily with Deren in the creation of this film, hence why he is credited alongside Deren in the film&#x27;s credit sequence. The film is also subtitled &#x27;Pas de Deux&#x27;, a dance term referring to a dance between two people, or in this case, a collaboration between Deren and Beatty.

&quot;A Study in Choreography for Camera&quot; was one of the first experimental dance films to be featured in the New York Times as well as Dance Magazine.

===&quot;Ritual in Transfigured Time&quot; (1946)===
By her fourth film, Deren discussed in &quot;An Anagram&quot; that she felt special attention should be given to unique possibilities of time and that the form should be ritualistic as a whole. &quot;Ritual in Transfigured Time&quot; began in August and was completed in 1946. It explored the fear of rejection and the freedom of expression in abandoning ritual, looking at the details as well as the bigger ideas of the nature and process of change. The main roles were played by Deren herself and the dancers Rita Christiani and Frank Westbrook.

===&quot;Meditation on Violence&quot; (1948)===
Deren&#x27;s &quot;Meditation on Violence&quot; was made in 1948. Chao-Li Chi&#x27;s performance obscures the distinction between violence and beauty. It was an attempt to &quot;abstract the principle of ongoing metamorphosis&quot;, found in &quot;Ritual in Transfigured Time,&quot; though Deren felt it was not as successful in the clarity of that idea, brought down by its philosophical weight. Halfway through the film, the sequence is rewound, producing a film loop.

==Criticism of Hollywood==
Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Deren attacked Hollywood for its artistic, political and economic monopoly over American cinema. She stated, &quot;I make my pictures for what Hollywood spends on lipstick,&quot; criticizing the amount of money spent on production. She also observed that Hollywood &quot;has been a major obstacle to the definition and development of motion pictures as a creative fine-art form.&quot; She set herself in opposition to the Hollywood film industry&#x27;s standards and practices.
Deren talks about the freedoms of independent cinema:

==Haiti and Vodou==
When Maya Deren decided to make an ethnographic film in Haiti, she was criticized for abandoning avant-garde film where she had made her name, but she was ready to expand to a new level as an artist. She had studied ethnographic footage by Gregory Bateson in Bali in 1947, and was interested in including it in her next film. In September, she divorced Hammid and left for a nine-month stay in Haiti. The Guggenheim Fellowship grant in 1946 enabled Deren to finance her travel and film footage for what would posthumously become &quot;Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti&quot;. She went on three additional trips through 1954 to document and record the rituals of Haitian Vodou.

A source of inspiration for ritual dance was Katherine Dunham who wrote her master&#x27;s thesis on Haitian dances in 1939, which Deren edited. While working as Dunham&#x27;s assistant, Deren was given access to Dunham&#x27;s archive which included 16mm documents on the dances in Trinidad and Haiti. Exposure to these documents led her to write her 1942 essay titled, &quot;Religious Possession in Dancing.&quot; Afterwards, Deren wrote several articles on religious possession in dancing before her first trip to Haiti. Deren filmed, recorded and photographed many hours of Vodou ritual, but she also participated in the ceremonies. She documented her knowledge and experience of Vodou in &quot;Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti&quot; (New York: Vanguard Press, 1953), edited by Joseph Campbell, which is considered a definitive source on the subject. She described her attraction to Vodou possession ceremonies, transformation, dance, play, games and especially ritual came from her strong feeling on the need to decenter our thoughts of self, ego and personality. In her book &quot;An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form, and Film&quot; she wrote:

Deren filmed 18,000 feet of Vodou rituals and people she met in Haiti on her Bolex camera. The footage was incorporated into a posthumous documentary film &quot;Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti&quot;, edited and produced in 1977 (with funding from Deren&#x27;s friend James Merrill) by her ex-husband, Teiji Itō (1935–1982), and his wife Cherel Winett Itō (1947–1999). All of the original wire recordings, photographs and notes are held in the Maya Deren Collection at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. The film footage is housed at Anthology Film Archives in New York City.

An LP of some of Deren&#x27;s wire recordings was published by the newly formed Elektra Records in 1953 entitled &quot;Voices of Haiti&quot;. The cover art for the album was by Teiji Itō.

Anthropologists Melville Herkovitz and Harold Courlander acknowledged the importance of &quot;Divine Horsemen&quot;, and in contemporary studies it is often cited as an authoritative voice, where Deren&#x27;s methodology has been especially praised because &quot;Vodou has resisted all orthodoxies, never mistaking surface representations for inner realities.&quot;

In her book of the same name Deren uses the spelling &quot;Voudoun&quot;, explaining: &quot;Voudoun terminology, titles and ceremonies still make use of the original African words and in this book they have been spelled out according to usual English phonetics and so as to render, as closely as possible, the Haitian pronunciation. Most of the songs, sayings and even some of the religious terms, however, are in Creole, which is primarily French in derivation (although it also contains African, Spanish and Indian words). Where the Creole word retains its French meaning, it has been written out so as to indicate both the original French word and the distinctive Creole pronunciation.&quot; In her Glossary of Creole Words, Deren includes &#x27;Voudoun&#x27; while the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; draws attention to the similar French word, &quot;Vaudoux.&quot;

==Death==
Deren died in 1961, at the age of 44 from a brain hemorrhage, which has been attributed to a combination of malnutrition and drug use. Her condition may have also been weakened by her long-term dependence on amphetamines and sleeping pills prescribed by Max Jacobson, a doctor and member of the arts scene, notorious for his liberal prescription of drugs, who later became famous as one of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s physicians.

==Legacy==

Deren was an inspiration to such up-and-coming avant-garde filmmakers as Curtis Harrington, Stan Brakhage, and Kenneth Anger, who emulated her independent, entrepreneurial spirit. Her influence can also be seen in films by Carolee Schneemann, Barbara Hammer, and Su Friedrich. In his review for renowned experimental filmmaker David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Inland Empire,&quot; writer Jim Emerson compares the work to &quot;Meshes of the Afternoon&quot;, apparently a favorite of Lynch&#x27;s.

Deren was a key figure in the creation of a New American Cinema, highlighting personal, experimental, underground film. In 1986, the American Film Institute created the Maya Deren Award to honor independent filmmakers.

&quot;The Legend of Maya Deren, Vol. 1 Part 2&quot; consists of hundreds of documents, interviews, oral histories, letters, and autobiographical memoirs.

Works about Deren and her works have been produced in various media:
* Deren appears as a character in the long narrative poem &quot;The Changing Light at Sandover&quot; (1976-1980) by her friend James Merrill.
* In 1987, Jo Ann Kaplan directed a biographical documentary about Deren, titled &quot;Invocation: Maya Deren&quot; (65 min)
* In 1994, the UK-based Horse and Bamboo Theatre created and toured &quot;Dance of White Darkness&quot; throughout Europe—the story of Deren&#x27;s visits to Haiti.
* In 2002, directed a feature-length documentary about Deren, titled &quot;In the Mirror of Maya Deren&quot; (&quot;Im Spiegel der Maya Deren&quot;), which featured music by John Zorn.

Deren&#x27;s films have also been shown with newly written alternative soundtracks:
* In 2004, the British rock group Subterraneans produced new soundtracks for six of Deren&#x27;s short films as part of a commission from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast&#x27;s annual film festival. &quot;At Land&quot; won the festival prize for sound design.
* In 2008, the Portuguese rock group Mão Morta produced new soundtracks for four of Deren&#x27;s short films as part of a commission from Curtas Vila do Conde&#x27;s annual film festival.

Deren was also an important film theorist. 
* Her most widely read essay on film theory is probably &quot;An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film&quot;, Deren&#x27;s seminal treatise that laid the groundwork for many of her ideas on film as an art form (Yonkers, NY: Alicat Book Shop Press, 1946).
* Her collected essays were published in 2005 and arranged in three sections:
# &quot;Film Poetics&quot;, including: Amateur versus Professional, Cinema as an Art Form, An Anagram of Ideas on Art, Form and Film, Cinematography: The Creative Use of Reality
# &quot;Film Production&quot;, including: Creating Movies with a New Dimension: Time, Creative Cutting, Planning by Eye, Adventures in Creative Film-Making
# &quot;Film in Medias Res&quot;, including: A Letter, Magic is New, New Directions in Film Art, Choreography for the Camera, Ritual in Transfigured Time, Meditation on Violence, The Very Eye of Night.
* &quot;Divine Horsemen: Living Gods of Haiti&quot; was published in 1953 by Vanguard Press (New York City) and Thames &amp; Hudson (London), republished under the title of &quot;The Voodoo Gods&quot; by Paladin in 1975, and again under its original title by McPherson &amp; Company in 1998.

<doc id="184635" wikidata="Q619436" url="?curid=184635" title="Quotient ring">
<text>In ring theory, a branch of abstract algebra, a quotient ring, also known as factor ring, difference ring or residue class ring, is a construction quite similar to the quotient group in group theory and to the quotient space in linear algebra. It is a specific example of a quotient, as viewed from the general setting of universal algebra. Starting with a ring formula_1 and a two-sided ideal formula_2 in , a new ring, the quotient ring , is constructed, whose elements are the cosets of formula_2 in formula_1 subject to special formula_5 and formula_6 operations. (Quotient ring notation always uses a fraction slash &quot;&quot;.)

Quotient rings are distinct from the so-called &quot;quotient field&quot;, or field of fractions, of an integral domain as well as from the more general &quot;rings of quotients&quot; obtained by localization.

== Formal quotient ring construction ==
Given a ring formula_1 and a two-sided ideal formula_2 in , we may define an equivalence relation formula_9 on formula_1 as follows:
: formula_11 if and only if formula_12 is in .
Using the ideal properties, it is not difficult to check that formula_9 is a congruence relation.
In case , we say that formula_14 and formula_15 are &quot;congruent modulo&quot; formula_2 (for example, formula_17 and formula_18 are congruent modulo formula_19 as their difference is an element of the ideal , the even integers). The equivalence class of the element formula_14 in formula_1 is given by:
formula_22

This equivalence class is also sometimes written as formula_23 and called the &quot;residue class of formula_14 modulo formula_2&quot;.

The set of all such equivalence classes is denoted by ; it becomes a ring, the factor ring or quotient ring of formula_1 modulo , if one defines
* .
(Here one has to check that these definitions are well-defined. Compare coset and quotient group.) The zero-element of formula_27 is , and the multiplicative identity is .

The map formula_28 from formula_1 to formula_27 defined by formula_31 is a surjective ring homomorphism, sometimes called the natural quotient map or the canonical homomorphism.

== Examples ==
* The quotient ring formula_32 is naturally isomorphic to , and formula_33 is the zero ring , since, by our definition, for any , we have that , which equals formula_1 itself. This fits with the rule of thumb that the larger the ideal , the smaller the quotient ring . If formula_2 is a proper ideal of , i.e., , then formula_36 is not the zero ring.
* Consider the ring of integers formula_37 and the ideal of even numbers, denoted by . Then the quotient ring formula_38 has only two elements, the coset formula_39 consisting of the even numbers and the coset formula_40 consisting of the odd numbers; applying the definition, , where formula_41 is the ideal of even numbers. It is naturally isomorphic to the finite field with two elements, . Intuitively: if you think of all the even numbers as , then every integer is either formula_42 (if it is even) or formula_17 (if it is odd and therefore differs from an even number by ). Modular arithmetic is essentially arithmetic in the quotient ring formula_44 (which has formula_45 elements).
* Now consider the ring of polynomials in the variable formula_46 with real coefficients, , and the ideal formula_47 consisting of all multiples of the polynomial . The quotient ring formula_48 is naturally isomorphic to the field of complex numbers , with the class formula_49 playing the role of the imaginary unit . The reason is that we &quot;forced&quot; , i.e. , which is the defining property of . Since any integer exponent of formula_50 must be either formula_51 or , that means all possible polynomials essentially simplify to the form . (To clarify, the quotient ring is actually naturally isomorphic to the field of all linear polynomials , where the operations are performed modulo . In return, we have , and this is matching formula_46 to the imaginary unit in the isomorphic field of complex numbers.)
* Generalizing the previous example, quotient rings are often used to construct field extensions. Suppose formula_53 is some field and formula_54 is an irreducible polynomial in . Then formula_55 is a field whose minimal polynomial over formula_53 is , which contains formula_53 as well as an element .
* One important instance of the previous example is the construction of the finite fields. Consider for instance the field formula_58 with three elements. The polynomial formula_59 is irreducible over formula_60 (since it has no root), and we can construct the quotient ring . This is a field with formula_61 elements, denoted by . The other finite fields can be constructed in a similar fashion.
* The coordinate rings of algebraic varieties are important examples of quotient rings in algebraic geometry. As a simple case, consider the real variety formula_62 as a subset of the real plane . The ring of real-valued polynomial functions defined on formula_63 can be identified with the quotient ring , and this is the coordinate ring of . The variety formula_63 is now investigated by studying its coordinate ring.
* Suppose formula_65 is a formula_66-manifold, and formula_28 is a point of . Consider the ring formula_68 of all formula_66-functions defined on formula_65 and let formula_2 be the ideal in formula_1 consisting of those functions formula_54 which are identically zero in some neighborhood formula_74 of formula_28 (where formula_74 may depend on ). Then the quotient ring formula_27 is the ring of germs of formula_66-functions on formula_65 at .
* Consider the ring formula_80 of finite elements of a hyperreal field . It consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, or equivalently: of all hyperreal numbers formula_81 for which a standard integer formula_45 with formula_83 exists. The set formula_2 of all infinitesimal numbers in , together with , is an ideal in , and the quotient ring formula_85 is isomorphic to the real numbers . The isomorphism is induced by associating to every element formula_81 of formula_80 the standard part of , i.e. the unique real number that differs from formula_81 by an infinitesimal. In fact, one obtains the same result, namely , if one starts with the ring formula_80 of finite hyperrationals (i.e. ratio of a pair of hyperintegers), see construction of the real numbers.

=== Variations of complex planes ===
The quotients , , and formula_90 are all isomorphic to formula_91 and gain little interest at first. But note that formula_92 is called the dual number plane in geometric algebra. It consists only of linear binomials as &quot;remainders&quot; after reducing an element of formula_93 by . This variation of a complex plane arises as a subalgebra whenever the algebra contains a real line and a nilpotent.

Furthermore, the ring quotient formula_94 does split into formula_95 and , so this ring is often viewed as the direct sum .
Nevertheless, a variation on complex numbers formula_96 is suggested by formula_97 as a root of , compared to formula_50 as root of . This plane of split-complex numbers normalizes the direct sum formula_99 by providing a basis formula_100 for 2-space where the identity of the algebra is at unit distance from the zero. With this basis a unit hyperbola may be compared to the unit circle of the ordinary complex plane.

=== Quaternions and variations ===
Suppose formula_46 and formula_102 are two non-commuting indeterminates and form the free algebra . Then Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions of 1843 can be cast as:
formula_103

If formula_104 is substituted for , then one obtains the ring of split-quaternions. The anti-commutative property formula_105 implies that formula_106 has as its square:
formula_107

Substituting minus for plus in &quot;both&quot; the quadratic binomials also results in split-quaternions.

The three types of biquaternions can also be written as quotients by use of the free algebra with three indeterminates formula_108 and constructing appropriate ideals.

== Properties ==
Clearly, if formula_1 is a commutative ring, then so is ; the converse, however, is not true in general.

The natural quotient map formula_28 has formula_2 as its kernel; since the kernel of every ring homomorphism is a two-sided ideal, we can state that two-sided ideals are precisely the kernels of ring homomorphisms.

The intimate relationship between ring homomorphisms, kernels and quotient rings can be summarized as follows: the ring homomorphisms defined on formula_27 are essentially the same as the ring homomorphisms defined on formula_1 that vanish (i.e. are zero) on . More precisely, given a two-sided ideal formula_2 in formula_1 and a ring homomorphism formula_116 whose kernel contains , there exists precisely one ring homomorphism formula_117 with formula_118 (where formula_28 is the natural quotient map). The map formula_120 here is given by the well-defined rule formula_121 for all formula_14 in . Indeed, this universal property can be used to &quot;define&quot; quotient rings and their natural quotient maps.

As a consequence of the above, one obtains the fundamental statement: every ring homomorphism formula_116 induces a ring isomorphism between the quotient ring formula_124 and the image . (See also: &quot;Fundamental theorem on homomorphisms&quot;.)

The ideals of formula_1 and formula_27 are closely related: the natural quotient map provides a bijection between the two-sided ideals of formula_1 that contain formula_2 and the two-sided ideals of formula_27 (the same is true for left and for right ideals). This relationship between two-sided ideal extends to a relationship between the corresponding quotient rings: if formula_65 is a two-sided ideal in formula_1 that contains , and we write formula_132 for the corresponding ideal in formula_27 (i.e. ), the quotient rings formula_134 and formula_135 are naturally isomorphic via the (well-defined) mapping .

The following facts prove useful in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry: for formula_136 commutative, formula_27 is a field if and only if formula_2 is a maximal ideal, while formula_36 is an integral domain if and only if formula_2 is a prime ideal. A number of similar statements relate properties of the ideal formula_2 to properties of the quotient ring .

The Chinese remainder theorem states that, if the ideal formula_2 is the intersection (or equivalently, the product) of pairwise coprime ideals , then the quotient ring formula_27 is isomorphic to the product of the quotient rings .

== For algebras over a ring ==

An associative algebra formula_144 over a commutative ring formula_1 is a ring itself. If formula_2 is an ideal in formula_144 (closed under formula_1-multiplication), then formula_149 inherits the structure of an algebra over formula_1 and is the quotient algebra.

<text>A lander is a spacecraft that descends towards, then comes to rest on the surface of an astronomical body other than Earth. In contrast to an impact probe, which makes a hard landing that damages or destroys the probe upon reaching the surface, a lander makes a soft landing after which the probe remains functional.

For bodies with atmospheres, the landing occurs after atmospheric entry. In these cases, landers may employ parachutes to slow them down enough to maintain a low terminal velocity. In some cases, small landing rockets will be fired just before impact in order to reduce the lander&#x27;s velocity. Landing may be accomplished by controlled descent and set down on landing gear, with the possible addition of a post-landing attachment mechanism (such as the mechanism used by &quot;Philae&quot;) for celestial bodies with low gravity. Some missions (for example, Luna 9 and Mars Pathfinder) used inflatable airbags to cushion the lander&#x27;s impact rather than utilizing more traditional landing gear.

When a high-velocity impact is intentionally planned in order to study the consequences of impact, the spacecraft is called an impactor.

Several terrestrial bodies have been subject to lander or impactor exploration. Among them are Earth&#x27;s Moon; the planets Venus, Mars, and Mercury; Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan; asteroids; and comets.

==Landers==

===Lunar===

Beginning with Luna 2 in 1959, the first few spacecraft to reach the lunar surface were impactors, not landers. They were part of the Soviet Luna program or the American Ranger program.

In 1966, the Soviet Luna 9 became the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth. The American Surveyor program (1966–1968) was designed to determine where Apollo could land safely. As a result, these robotic missions required soft landers to sample the lunar soil and determine the thickness of the dust layer, which was unknown before Surveyor.

The U.S.-crewed Apollo Lunar Modules (1969–1972) with rovers (1971–1972) and late Soviet large robotic landers (1969–), Lunokhods (1970–1973) and sample return missions (1970–1976) used a rocket descent engine for a soft landing of astronauts and lunar rovers on the Moon.

The Chinese Chang&#x27;e 3 mission and its &quot;Yutu&quot; (&#x27;Jade Rabbit&#x27;) rover landed on 14 December 2013. In 2019, China&#x27;s Chang&#x27;e 4 mission successfully landed the &quot;Yutu-2&quot; rover on the far side of the Moon. Chang&#x27;e 5 and Chang&#x27;e 6 are designed to be sample return missions. Chang&#x27;e 5 and 6 were conducted successfully in 2020 and 2024 respectively. Chang&#x27;e 5 mission landed on the Moon on 1 December 2020, China completed the Chang&#x27;e 5 mission on 16 December 2020 with the return of approximately 2 kilograms of lunar sample.

On 6 September 2019, the lander &quot;Vikram&quot; on Chandrayaan-2, attempting to land on the lunar south polarregion. Due to software glitch, it lost contact and crashed moments before landing.

About 4 years later, on 23 August 2023, the lander &quot;Vikram&quot; on Chandrayaan-3 successfully touched down on the lunar south pole, close to the crater Manzinus U. This made it the first lander to soft land at the south pole of the Moon.

Japan became the fifth country to land a lunar probe on 19 January 2024, by successfully landing its SLIM lander.

On 22 February 2024, Intuitive Machine&#x27;s &quot;Odysseus&quot; successfully landed on the Moon after taking off on a SpaceX Falcon 9. This was the first successful landing of a privately owned spacecraft on the Moon.

China sent Chang&#x27;e 6 on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon. This is China&#x27;s second lunar sample return mission, the first was achieved by Chang&#x27;e 5 from the lunar near side four years earlier. It also carried the Chinese &quot;Jinchan&quot; rover to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface and imaged Chang&#x27;e 6 lander on lunar surface. The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024 at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon&#x27;s surface on 1 June 2024. The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024 at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, and later completed another robotic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed in Inner Mongolia on 25 June 2024, completing China&#x27;s far side extraterrestrial sample return mission.

===Venus===

The Soviet Venera program included a number of Venus landers, some of which were crushed during descent much as Galileo&#x27;s Jupiter &quot;lander&quot; and others which successfully touched down. Venera 3 in 1966 and Venera 7 in 1970 became the first impact and soft landing on Venus respectively. The Soviet Vega program also placed two balloons in the Venusian atmosphere in 1985, which were the first aerial tools on other planets.

===Mars===

The Soviet Union&#x27;s Mars 1962B became the first mission intended to impact on Mars in 1962. In 1971, the lander of the Mars 3 probe conducted the first soft landing on Mars, but communication was lost within a minute after touchdown, which occurred during one of the worst global dust storms since the beginning of telescopic observations of the Red Planet. Three other landers, Mars 2 in 1971 and Mars 5 and Mars 6 in 1973, either crashed or failed to even enter the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. All four landers used an aeroshell-like heat shield during atmospheric entry. Mars 2 and Mars 3 landers carried the first small skis-walking Mars rovers, PrOP-M, that did not work on the planet.

The Soviet Union planned the heavy Marsokhod Mars 4NM mission in 1973 and the Mars sample return Mars 5NM mission in 1975, but neither occurred due to needing the N1 super-launcher that was never flown successfully. A double-launching Soviet Mars 5M (Mars-79) sample return mission was planned for 1979 but cancelled due to complexity and technical problems.

NASA&#x27;s &quot;Viking 1&quot; and &quot;Viking 2&quot; were launched respectively in August and September 1975, each comprising an orbiter vehicle and a lander. &quot;Viking 1&quot; landed in July 1976 &quot;Viking 2&quot; in September 1976. The Viking program rovers were the first successful, functioning Mars landers. The mission ended in May 1983, after both landers had stopped working.

Mars 96 was the first complex post-Soviet Russian mission with an orbiter, lander, penetrators. Planned for 1996, it failed at launch. A planned repeat of this mission, Mars 98, was cancelled due to lack of funding.

The U.S. &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; was launched in December 1996 and released the first acting rover on Mars, &quot;Sojourner&quot;, in July 1997. It worked until September 1997.

The Mars Polar Lander ceased communication on 3 December 1999 prior to reaching the surface and is presumed to have crashed.
The European &quot;Beagle 2&quot; lander deployed successfully from the &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft but the signal confirming a landing which should have come on 25 December 2003 was not received. No communication was ever established and &quot;Beagle 2&quot; was declared lost on 6 February 2004. The proposed 2009 British &quot;Beagle 3&quot; lander mission to search for life, past or present, was not adopted.

The American Mars Exploration Rovers &quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot; were launched in June and July 2003. They reached the Martian surface in January 2004 using landers featuring airbags and parachutes to soften impact. &quot;Spirit&quot; ceased functioning in 2010, more than five years past its design lifetime. As of 13 February 2019, &quot;Opportunity&quot; was declared effectively dead, having exceeded its three-month design lifetime by well over a decade.
The U.S. spacecraft &quot;Phoenix&quot; successfully achieved soft landing on the surface of Mars on 25 May 2008, using a combination of parachutes and rocket descent engines.

Mars Science Laboratory, which carried the rover &quot;Curiosity&quot;, was launched by NASA on 26 November 2011. It landed in the Aeolis Palus region of Gale Crater on Mars on 6 August 2012.

China launched the Tianwen-1 mission, on 23 July 2020. It includes an orbiter, a lander and a 240 kilograms rover. The orbiter was placed into orbit on 10 February 2021. The &quot;Zhurong&quot; successfully soft landed on 14 May 2021 and deployed on 22 May 2021.


===Martian moons===

While several flybys conducted by Mars orbiting probes have provided images and other data about the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, only few of them intended to land on the surface of these satellites. Two probes under the Soviet Phobos program were successfully launched in 1988, but in 1989 the intended landings on Phobos and Deimos were not conducted due to failures in the spacecraft system. The post-Soviet Russian Fobos-Grunt probe was an intended sample return mission to Phobos in 2012 but failed after launch in 2011.

In 2007 European Space Agency and EADS Astrium proposed and developed the mission to Phobos to 2016 with lander and sample return, but it stayed as a project. Since 2007 the Canadian Space Agency has considered a mission to Phobos called Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration (PRIME), which would include an orbiter and lander. Recent proposals include a 2008 NASA Glenn Research Center Phobos and Deimos sample return mission, the 2013 Phobos Surveyor, and the OSIRIS-REx II mission concept.

The Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) plans to launch the Martian Moons Exploration (MMX) mission in 2026, a sample return mission targeting Phobos. MMX will land and collect samples from Phobos multiple times, along with deploying a rover jointly developed by CNES and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). By using a corer sampling mechanism, the spacecraft aims to retrieve a minimum of 10g of samples. MMX will return to Earth in 2029.

=== Titan (moon of Saturn) ===

The &quot;Huygens&quot; probe, carried to Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan by &quot;Cassini&quot;, was specifically designed to survive landing on land or on liquid. It was thoroughly drop-tested to make sure it could withstand impact and continue functioning for at least three minutes. However, due to the low-speed impact, it continued providing data for more than two hours after it landed. The landing on Titan in 2005 was the first, and to date only, landing on any planet&#x27;s satellite other than Earth&#x27;s moon.

The proposed U.S. Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) mission considered a lander that would splash down in a lake in Titan&#x27;s northern hemisphere and float on the surface of the lake for few months. Spain&#x27;s proposed Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE) mission is similar to the TiME lander but has its own propulsion system for controlling shipping.

===Comets and asteroids===

&quot;Vesta&quot;, the multi-aimed Soviet mission, was developed in cooperation with European countries for realization in 1991–1994 but canceled due to the Soviet Union disbanding. It included a flyby of Mars, where &quot;Vesta&quot; would deliver an aerostat (balloon or airship) and small landers or penetrators, followed by flybys of Ceres or 4 Vesta and some other asteroids with the impact of a large penetrator on one of them.

The first landing on a small Solar System body (an object in the Solar System that is not a moon, planet, or dwarf planet) was performed in 2001 by the probe NEAR Shoemaker at asteroid 433 Eros despite the fact that NEAR was not originally designed to be capable of landing.

Japanese &quot;Hayabusa&quot; probe made several attempts to land on 25143 Itokawa in 2005 with mixed success, including a failed attempt to deploy a rover. Designed to rendezvous and land on a low-gravity body, &quot;Hayabusa&quot; became the second spacecraft to land on an asteroid, and in 2010 the first sample return mission from an asteroid.

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; probe, launched 2 March 2004, put the first robotic lander &quot;Philae&quot; on the comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014. Due to the extremely low gravity of such bodies, the landing system included a harpoon launcher intended to anchor a cable in the comet&#x27;s surface and pull the lander down.

JAXA launched the &quot;Hayabusa2&quot; asteroid space probe in 2014 to deliver several landing parts (including Minerva II and German Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout (MASCOT) landers and a Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI) penetrator) in 2018–2019 to return samples to Earth by 2020.

The Chinese Space Agency is designing a sample retrieval mission from Ceres that would take place during the 2020s.

===Mercury===

Launched in October 2018 and expected to reach Mercury in December 2025, ESA&#x27;s BepiColombo mission to Mercury was originally designed to include the Mercury Surface Element (MSE). The lander would have carried a 7 kg payload consisting of an imaging system (a descent camera and a surface camera), a heat flow and physical properties package, an alpha particle X-ray spectrometer, a magnetometer, a seismometer, a soil penetrating device (mole), and a micro-rover. The MSE aspect of the mission was cancelled in 2003 due to budgetary constraints.

===Moons of Jupiter===

A few Jupiter probes provide many images and other data about its moons. Some proposed missions with landing on Jupiter&#x27;s moons were canceled or not adopted. The small nuclear-powered Europa lander was proposed as part of NASA&#x27;s Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission that was canceled in 2006.

NASA&#x27;s &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; is planned to explore Jupiter&#x27;s moons, particularly Europa, starting in 2030. NASA considered a lander or impactor to fly alongside &quot;Europa Clipper&quot;, but ultimately declined. As Europa is hypothesized to have water beneath its icy surface, these missions are sent to investigate its habitability and assess its astrobiological potential by confirming the existence of water on the moon and determining the water&#x27;s characteristics.

==Impactors==

===Deep Space 2===
The Deep Space 2 impactor probe was to be the first spacecraft to penetrate below the surface of another planet. However, the mission failed with the loss of its mother ship, &quot;Mars Polar Lander&quot;, which lost communication with Earth during entry into Mars&#x27; atmosphere on 3 December 1999.

===&quot;Deep Impact&quot;===

Comet Tempel 1 was visited by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe on 4 July 2005. The impact crater formed was approximately 200m wide and 30–50m deep, and scientists detected the presence of silicates, carbonates, smectite, amorphous carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

===Moon Impact Probe===
The Moon Impact Probe (MIP) developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), India&#x27;s national space agency, was a lunar probe that was released on 14 November 2008 by ISRO&#x27;s Chandrayaan-1 lunar remote sensing orbiter. Chandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008. It led to the discovery of the presence of water on the Moon.

===LCROSS===

The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) was a robotic spacecraft operated by NASA to perform a lower-cost means of determining the nature of hydrogen detected at the polar regions of the Moon. The main LCROSS mission objective was to explore the presence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater near a lunar polar region. LCROSS was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009, as part of the shared Lunar Precursor Robotic Program. LCROSS was designed to collect and relay data from the impact and debris plume resulting from the launch vehicle&#x27;s spent Centaur upper rocket stage striking the crater Cabeus near the south pole of the Moon. Centaur impacted successfully on 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC. The &quot;shepherding spacecraft&quot; (carrying the LCROSS mission payload) descended through Centaur&#x27;s plume of debris, and collected and relayed data before impacting six minutes later at 11:37 UTC. The project was successful in discovering water in Cabeus.

===&quot;MESSENGER&quot;===

The NASA &quot;MESSENGER&quot; (Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging) mission to Mercury launched on 3 August 2004 and entered orbit around the planet on 18 March 2011. Following a mapping mission, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; was directed to impact Mercury&#x27;s surface on 30 April 2015. The spacecraft&#x27;s impact with Mercury occurred near 3:26pm EDT on 30 April 2015, leaving a crater estimated to be 16m in diameter.

===AIDA===
The ESA&#x27;s AIDA mission concept would investigate the effects of impact crashing a spacecraft into an asteroid. The DART spacecraft impacted asteroid 65803 Didymos&#x27;s moon Dimorphos in 2022, and the Hera spacecraft will arrive in 2027 to investigate the effects of the impact.

<text>The &quot;Vega&quot; program () was a series of Venus missions that also took advantage of the appearance of comet 1P/Halley in 1986. &quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot; were uncrewed spacecraft launched in a cooperative effort among the Soviet Union (who also provided the spacecraft and launch vehicle) and Austria, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Federal Republic of Germany in December 1984. They had a two-part mission to investigate Venus and also flyby Halley&#x27;s Comet.

The flyby of Halley&#x27;s Comet had been a late mission change in the Venera program, following on from the cancellation of the American Halley mission in 1981. A later Venera mission was canceled and the Venus part of the &quot;Vega 1&quot; mission was reduced. Because of this, the craft was designated VeGa, a contraction of &quot;Venera&quot; and &quot;Gallei&quot; (Венера and Галлей respectively, the Russian words for &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;Halley&quot;). The spacecraft design was based on the previous Venera 9 and Venera 10 missions.

The two spacecraft were launched on 15 and 21 December 1984, respectively. With their redesignated dual missions, the Vega probes became part of the Halley Armada, a group of space probes that studied Halley&#x27;s Comet during its 1985/1986 perihelion.

==The Vega spacecraft==

&quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot; were identical sister ships developed from the earlier &quot;Venera&quot; craft. They were of the 5VK type, designed by Babakin Space Center and constructed by Lavochkin at Khimki. The craft were powered by twin large solar panels and instruments included an antenna dish, cameras, spectrometer, infrared sounder, magnetometers (MISCHA), and plasma probes. The craft were launched by a Proton 8K82K rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Kazakh SSR (current Kazakhstan). Both &quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot; were three-axis stabilized spacecraft. The spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from Halley&#x27;s comet.

===Bus Instruments===

* imaging system
* infrared spectrometer
* ultraviolet, visible, infrared imaging spectrometer
* shield penetration detector
* dust detectors
* dust mass spectrometer
* neutral gas mass spectrometer
* APV-V plasma energy analyzer
* energetic-particle analyzer
* magnetometer
* wave and plasma analyzers
==The Venus mission==
&quot;Vega 1&quot; arrived at Venus on 11 June 1985 and &quot;Vega 2&quot; on 15 June 1985, and each delivered a , diameter spherical descent unit. The units were released some days before each arrived at Venus and entered the atmosphere without active inclination changes. Each contained a lander and a balloon explorer.

===Descent craft===

The landers were identical to that of the previous five &quot;Venera&quot; missions and were to study the atmosphere and surface. Each had instruments to study temperature and pressure, a UV spectrometer, a water concentration meter, a gas-phase chromatograph, an X-ray spectrometer, a mass spectrometer, and a surface sampling device.

The &quot;Vega 1&quot; lander&#x27;s surface experiments were inadvertently activated at from the surface by an especially hard wind jolt, and so failed to provide results. It landed at 7.5°N, 177.7°E.

The &quot;Vega 2&quot; lander touched down at 03:00:50 UT on 15 June 1985 at 8.5° S, 164.5° E, in eastern Aphrodite Terra. The altitude of the touchdown site was above the planetary mean radius. The measured pressure at the landing site was 91 atm and the temperature was . The surface sample was found to be an anorthosite-troctolite. The lander transmitted data from the surface for 56 minutes.

====Payload====

* Meteocomplex T,P sensors
* Sigma-3 gas chromatograph
* LSA particle size spectrometer
* IFP aerosol analyzer
* VM-4 hygrometer
* ISAV-A nephelometer/scatterometer
* Malakhit-V mass spectrometer
* ISAV-S UV spectrometer
* GZU VB-02 drill + BDRP-AM25 soil X-ray fluorescence spectrometer
* GS-15-STsV gamma ray spectrometer
* PrOP-V penetrometer
* MSB small solar batteries
===Balloon===

The two balloon aerobots were designed to float at from the surface, in the most active layer of the Venusian cloud system. The instrument pack had enough battery power for 60 hours of operation and measured temperature, pressure, wind speed, and aerosol density. The balloon envelopes were surfaced with polytetrafluoroethylene to resist attack by the corrosive atmosphere. Both Vega-1 and Vega-2 balloons operated for more than 46 hours from injection to the final transmission.

The balloons were of spherical superpressure types of diameter, filled with helium. A gondola assembly weighing and long was connected to the balloon envelope by a tether long. Total mass of the entire assembly was .

The top section of the gondola assembly was capped by a conical antenna tall and wide at the base. Beneath the antenna was a module containing the radio transmitter and system control electronics. The lower section of the gondola assembly carried the instrument payload and batteries.

The instruments consisted of:
* An arm carrying thin-film resistance thermometers and a velocity anemometer. The anemometer consisted of a free-spinning plastic propeller, whose spin was measured by LED-photodetector optointerrupters.
* A module containing a PIN diode photodetector to measure light levels and a vibrating-quartz-beam pressure sensor.
* A package at the bottom carrying the batteries and a nephelometer to measure cloud density through light reflection.

The small low-power (5 watt) transmitter only allowed a data transmission rate of 2,048 bit/s, though the system performed data compression to squeeze more information through the narrow bandwidth. Nonetheless, the sampling rate for most of the instruments was only once every 75 seconds. The balloons were tracked by two networks (20 radio telescopes total) back on Earth: the Soviet network, coordinated by the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and the international network, coordinated by of France (CNES).

The balloons were pulled out of the lander at above the planet&#x27;s darkside surface, and fell to ASL while they were being inflated. After that, they rose to and stabilized. At this altitude, pressure and temperature conditions of Venus are similar to those of Earth at 18,000 feet MSL (5,5 km), though the planet&#x27;s winds move at hurricane velocity, and the carbon dioxide atmosphere is laced with sulphuric acid, along with smaller concentrations of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acid.

The balloons moved swiftly across the night side of the planet into the light side, where their batteries finally died, and contact was lost. Tracking indicated that the motion of the balloons included a surprising vertical component, revealing vertical motions of air masses that had not been detected by earlier probe missions.

==The Halley mission==

After their encounters, the Vega motherships were redirected to intercept Comet Halley, utilizing the gravity of Venus to alter their trajectory.

&quot;Vega 1&quot; made its closest approach on 6 March, around from the nucleus, and &quot;Vega 2&quot; made its closest approach on 9 March at . The data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach. They were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus, such as dimensions, shape, temperature, and surface properties, as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma, the gas composition close to the nucleus, the dust particles&#x27; composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus, and the cometary-solar wind interaction.

In total &quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot; returned about 1,500 images of Comet Halley. Spacecraft operations were discontinued a few weeks after the Halley encounters.

The on-board TV system was created in international cooperation of the scientific and industrial facilities from the USSR, Hungary, France, and Czechoslovakia. The TV data was processed by an international team, including scientists from the Soviet Union, Hungary, France, East Germany, and the United States. The basic steps of data acquisition and preprocessing were performed in IKI using an image processing computer system based on a PDP-11/40 compatible host.

&quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot; are currently in heliocentric orbits.

<doc id="184647" wikidata="Q2288042" url="?curid=184647" title="Simone Beck">
<text>Simone &quot;Simca&quot; Beck (7 July 1904 – 20 December 1991) was a French cookbook writer and cooking teacher who, along with colleagues Julia Child and Louisette Bertholle, played a significant role in the introduction of French cooking technique and recipes into American kitchens.

==Early life==
Beck was born on 7 July 1904, in Tocqueville-en-Caux, near Dieppe in Normandy. Her family was rich because they had a business in production of Bénédictine liqueur. When she was little, she liked helping her family cook to prepare desserts or entire meals. 

In 1923, at her parents&#x27; urging to marry, she wed Jacques Jarlaud. After surviving a car crash in 1928, she worked for four years bookbinding and being a sales representative, where she met her second husband. In 1933, at the end of her marriage with Jacques Jarlaud, she applied to the Le Cordon Bleu school in Paris. 

In 1936, Beck met Jean Victor Fischbacher. After marrying him in 1937, she kept her maiden name as a pen name and professionally, but used her husband&#x27;s name socially.

==Cooking career==
The start of Beck&#x27;s professional career as a cook and teacher was after World War II, and after joining Le Cercle des Gourmettes, an exclusive women&#x27;s culinary club. She became involved in the world of cooking. She was inspired to write a cookbook for Americans by Louisette Bertholle and Fischbacher.

The first attempt at writing a cookbook wasn&#x27;t successful, so Beck and Bertholle published the brief &quot;What&#x27;s Cooking in France?&quot; in 1952. After that Beck published a booklet &quot;Le pruneau devant le fourneau: Recettes de cuisine&quot; (ca. 1952), Beck&#x27;s only publication in French. In 1949, after she had met Julia Child, she became inspired to write a French cookbook for Americans again. She, Child, and Bertholle together wrote &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot;, which was published in 1961. &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Vol. II&quot; (without Louisette Bertholle) followed in 1970, elaborating on several subjects (particularly baking and charcuterie) that the authors felt had received insufficient coverage in the first volume.

Both Bertholle and Child became members of Le Cercle des Gourmettes. After three years, the three women formed l&#x27;École des trois gourmandes to give lessons in French cooking to American women who lived in Paris. This school had been working up to the late 1970s. While Child became a successful television chef in the United States, Beck continued her teaching practice at home. In 1972 she published her own cookbook, &quot;Simca&#x27;s Cuisine&quot; (with Patricia Simon), using some of the recipes that had not been mentioned in her previous books with Child and Bertholle. In 1979, she published the second volume, &quot;New Menus from Simca&#x27;s Cuisine&quot;, with Michael James, who was her student, friend, and assistant since the 1970s. &quot;Food and Friends: Recipes and Memories from Simca&#x27;s Cuisine&quot;, her autobiography and last cookbook (with Suzy Patterson), was published in 1991, the year she died.

==Death==
Simone Beck died on Friday, December 20, 1991, at her home in Châteauneuf-de-Grasse, a small village near Nice. She was 87. 
Her cousin, Harold Earle said she had been having heart problems for several months and had stopped eating; he stated, &quot;The doctor said that because she wouldn&#x27;t eat, she died&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

* Beck was portrayed by American actress Linda Emond in the 2009 film &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;.
* Beck was portrayed by Isabella Rossellini in the 2022 comedy television series &quot;Julia&quot;.

<doc id="184659" wikidata="Q283311" url="?curid=184659" title="Frank Luke">
<text>Frank Luke Jr. (May 19, 1897 – September 29, 1918) was an American fighter ace credited with 19 aerial victories, ranking him second among United States Army Air Service (USAAS) pilots during World War I, after Eddie Rickenbacker. Luke was the first airman to receive the Medal of Honor and first USAAS ace in a day. Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, a United States Air Force pilot training installation since World War II, is named in his honor.

==Early life==
Luke was born May 19, 1897, in Phoenix, Arizona, after his father emigrated from Germany to the United States in 1874 and settled there. Frank was his family&#x27;s fifth child, and had eight brothers and sisters. He grew up excelling in sports, working in copper mines, and participating in bare-knuckle boxing matches. 

==World War I==
Following the United States&#x27; entry into World War I in April 1917, Frank enlisted in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps on September 25, 1917, and received pilot training in Texas and California. 

===27th Aero Squadron===
After being commissioned a second lieutenant in March 1918, he deployed to France for further training, and in July was assigned to the 27th Aero Squadron. Stephen Skinner&#x27;s book &quot;The Stand&quot; notes that he received a posthumous promotion to first lieutenant.

Because of his arrogance and occasional tendencies to fly alone and disobey orders, Luke was disliked by some of his peers and superiors. But the 27th was under standing orders to destroy German observation balloons. Because of this, Luke, along with his close friend Lieutenant Joseph Frank Wehner, continually volunteered to attack these important targets although they were heavily defended by anti-aircraft guns on the ground. The two pilots began a string of victories together, with Luke attacking the balloons and Wehner flying protective cover. Wehner was killed in action on September 18, 1918, by Georg von Hantelmann in a dogfight with Fokker D.VIIs, which were attacking Luke. Luke then shot down two of these D.VIIs, two balloons, and a Halberstadt; the last &quot;credit&quot; enabled Luke to achieve his 13th official kill—a Halberstadt C-type observation plane of Flieger Abteilung 36.

Between September 12 and 29, Luke was credited with shooting down 14 German balloons and four airplanes: Luke achieved these 18 victories during just 10 sorties in eight days, a feat unsurpassed by any pilot in World War I.

===Death===

Luke&#x27;s final flight took place during the first phase of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. On September 28, 1918, after achieving his 14th and 15th victories, he landed his SPAD XIII at the French aerodrome at Cicognes where he spent the night, claiming engine trouble. When he returned to the 1st Pursuit Group&#x27;s base at Rembercourt the next day, he was confronted by Captain Alfred A. Grant, his squadron&#x27;s commanding officer. Despite being under threat of arrest by Grant for absence without leave, Luke took off without authorization and flew to a forward airbase at Verdun, where his sympathetic group commander, Major Hartney, canceled the arrest order and gave Luke tacit approval to continue his balloon hunting. 

That evening Luke flew to the front to attack three balloons in the vicinity of Dun-sur-Meuse, six miles behind the German lines. He first dropped a message to a nearby United States balloon company, alerting them to observe his imminent attacks. Luke shot down the enemy balloons, but was then severely wounded by a single machine gun bullet fired from a hilltop above him, a mile east of the last balloon site he had attacked. Luke landed in a field just west of the small village of Murvaux—after strafing a group of German soldiers on the ground—near the Ruisseau de Bradon, a stream leading to the Meuse River. Although weakened by his wound, he made his way toward the stream, intending to reach the cover of its adjacent underbrush, but finally collapsed some 200 meters from his airplane. Approached by German infantry, Luke drew his Colt Model 1911 pistol and fired a few rounds at his attackers before dying. Reports that a day later his body was found with an empty gun and a bullet hole in his chest, with seven dead Germans in front of him were proven erroneous. According to author Skinner, the fatal bullet, fired from the hilltop machine gun position, had entered near Luke&#x27;s right shoulder, passed through his body, and exited from his left side.

On September 30, 1918, the Germans buried Luke in the Murvaux cemetery, from where his body was retrieved two months later by American forces. His final resting place is the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery and Memorial, located east of the village of Romagne-sous-Montfaucon.

After the United States Army obtained sworn testimony from French and American sources, Luke was awarded a posthumous Medal of Honor. The presentation was made to Frank Luke Sr., in Phoenix in May 1919. The family later donated the medal to the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio. The museum&#x27;s small exhibit honoring Luke also contains his flying goggles, the gunsight from his last SPAD, documents written by Luke, and other personal items. The museum&#x27;s Early Years Gallery displays a fully restored SPAD XIII of the type flown by Luke.

Eddie Rickenbacker said of Luke: 

He was the most daring aviator and greatest fighter pilot of the entire war. His life is one of the brightest glories of our Air Service. He went on a rampage and shot down fourteen enemy aircraft, including ten balloons, in eight days. No other ace, even the dreaded Richthofen, had ever come close to that.
==Other aces==
Luke is often cited as the second-ranking United States ace of World War I, but that statement ignores certain American pilots who flew with other air services. Luke was, however, second only to Rickenbacker among pilots serving only with the AEF. (It is noteworthy that Luke&#x27;s time on the front was comparatively quite short, and 17 of Luke&#x27;s 18 victories were officially recorded as destroyed, versus only 11 of Rickenbacker&#x27;s 26.) Americans flying with Britain&#x27;s Royal Flying Corps (or Royal Air Force from April 1918) who exceeded Luke&#x27;s score were Frederick W. Gillet (20 claims, all destroyed); Harold Albert Kullberg (19 confirmed) and Wilfred Beaver (19 claims, 12 destroyed). Tied with Luke at 18 was William C. Lambert.

==Honors and awards==
===Medal of Honor citation===
Rank and Organization: Second Lieutenant, 27th Aero Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group. Place and Date: Near Murvaux, France, September 29, 1918. Entered Service At Phoenix, Ariz. Born: May 19, 1897, Phoenix, Ariz. G. O. No.: 59, W.D., 1919.

Citation:
The citation contained errors attributable to confused accounts from French witnesses to Luke&#x27;s final flight, and to a staff officer&#x27;s re-write of the original write-up, which emphasized the numerous high-risk missions he flew between September 12 and 29. Reports that he was intercepted by German fighters, strafed enemy troops before his forced landing; and was &quot;surrounded on all sides&quot; were literal misinterpretations of French testimony and became part of the mythology that grew up around the event.

<doc id="184661" wikidata="Q852569" url="?curid=184661" title="Fish migration">
<text>Fish migration is mass relocation by fish from one area or body of water to another. Many types of fish migrate on a regular basis, on time scales ranging from daily to annually or longer, and over distances ranging from a few metres to thousands of kilometres. Such migrations are usually done for better feeding or to reproduce, but in other cases the reasons are unclear.

Fish migrations involve movements of schools of fish on a scale and duration larger than those arising during normal daily activities. Some particular types of migration are &quot;anadromous&quot;, in which adult fish live in the sea and migrate into fresh water to spawn; and &quot;catadromous&quot;, in which adult fish live in fresh water and migrate into salt water to spawn.

Marine forage fish often make large migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Their movements are associated with ocean currents and with the availability of food in different areas at different times of the year. The migratory movements may partly be linked to the fact that the fish cannot identify their own offspring and moving in this way prevents cannibalism. Some species have been described by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as highly migratory species. These are large pelagic fish that move in and out of the exclusive economic zones of different nations, and these are covered differently in the treaty from other fish.

Salmon and striped bass are well-known anadromous fish, and freshwater eels are catadromous fish that make large migrations. The bull shark is a euryhaline species that moves at will from fresh to salt water, and many marine fish make a diel vertical migration, rising to the surface to feed at night and sinking to lower layers of the ocean by day. Some fish such as tuna move to the north and south at different times of year following temperature gradients. The patterns of migration are of great interest to the fishing industry. Movements of fish in fresh water also occur; often the fish swim upriver to spawn, and these traditional movements are increasingly being disrupted by the building of dams.

==Classification==
As with various other aspects of fish life, zoologists have developed empirical classifications for fish migrations. The first two following terms have been in long-standing wide usage, while others are of more recent coinage.

* Anadromous – fish that migrate from the sea up (Greek: ἀνά &quot;aná&quot;, &quot;up&quot; and δρόμος &quot;drómos&quot;, &quot;course&quot;) into fresh water to spawn, such as salmon, striped bass, and the sea lamprey
* Catadromous – fish that migrate from fresh water down (Greek: κατά &quot;kata&quot;, &quot;down&quot; and δρόμος &quot;dromos&quot;, &quot;course&quot;) into the sea to spawn, such as eels

George S. Myers coined the following terms in a 1949 journal article:
* Diadromous – &quot;all&quot; fish that migrate between the sea and fresh water. Like the two aforementioned, well-known terms, &quot;diadromous&quot; was formed from Classical Greek ([&quot;dia&quot;], &quot;through&quot;; and [&quot;dromous&quot;], &quot;running&quot;).
* Amphidromous – fish that migrate from fresh water to the sea, or vice versa, but not for the purpose of breeding. Instead they enter saltwater or freshwater as larvae, where they will grow into juveniles before returning to the habitat they originally came from and stay there for the rest of their life, growing into sexually mature adults.
* Potamodromous – fish whose migrations occur wholly within fresh water
* Oceanodromous – fish that live and migrate wholly in the sea

Although these classifications originated for fish, they can apply, in principle, to any aquatic organism.

List of diadromous orders and families, and the number of known species:

==Forage fish==

Forage fish often make great migrations between their spawning, feeding and nursery grounds. Schools of a particular stock usually travel in a triangle between these grounds. For example, one stock of herrings has their spawning ground in southern Norway, their feeding ground in Iceland, and their nursery ground in northern Norway. Wide triangular journeys such as these may be important because forage fish, when feeding, cannot distinguish their own offspring.

Capelin are a forage fish of the smelt family found in the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. In summer, they graze on dense swarms of plankton at the edge of the ice shelf. Larger capelin also eat krill and other crustaceans. The capelin move inshore in large schools to spawn and migrate in spring and summer to feed in plankton rich areas between Iceland, Greenland and Jan Mayen. The migration is affected by ocean currents. Around Iceland, maturing capelin make large northward feeding migrations in spring and summer. The return migration takes place from September to November. The spawning migration starts north of Iceland in December or January.

The diagram on the right shows the main spawning grounds and larval drift routes. Capelin on the way to feeding grounds is coloured green, capelin on the way back is blue, and the breeding grounds are red.

In a paper published in 2009, researchers from Iceland recount their application of an interacting particle model to the capelin stock around Iceland, successfully predicting the spawning migration route for 2008.

==Highly migratory species==

The term highly migratory species (HMS) has its origins in Article 64 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The Convention does not provide an operational definition of the term, but in an annex (UNCLOS Annex 1) lists the species considered highly migratory by parties to the convention. The list includes: tuna and tuna-like species (albacore, bluefin, bigeye tuna, skipjack, yellowfin, blackfin, little tunny, southern bluefin and bullet), wahoo, pomfret, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, saury and oceangoing sharks, dolphins and other cetaceans.

These high trophic level oceanodromous species undertake migrations of significant but variable distances across oceans for feeding, often on forage fish, or reproduction, and also have wide geographic distributions. Thus, these species are found both inside the exclusive economic zones and in the high seas outside these zones. They are pelagic species, which means they mostly live in the open ocean and do not live near the sea floor, although they may spend part of their life cycle in nearshore waters.

Highly migratory species can be compared with straddling stock and transboundary stock. Straddling stock range both within an EEZ as well as in the high seas. Transboundary stock range in the EEZs of at least two countries. A stock can be both transboundary and straddling.

It can be challenging to determine the population structure of highly migratory species using physical tagging. Traditional genetic markers such as short-range PCR products, microsatellites and SNP-arrays have struggled to identify population structure and distinguish fish stocks from separate ocean basins. However, population genomic research using RAD sequencing in yellowfin tuna, albacore, and wahoo has been able to distinguish populations from different ocean basins and reveal fine-scale population structure. Similar population genomics methods have also provided improved insight towards population structure in striped marlin.

==Other examples==
Some of the best-known anadromous fishes are the Pacific salmon species, such as Chinook (king), coho (silver), chum (dog), pink (humpback) and sockeye (red) salmon. These salmon hatch in small freshwater streams. From there they migrate to the sea to mature, living there for two to six years. When mature, the salmon return to the same streams where they were hatched to spawn. Salmon are capable of going hundreds of kilometers upriver, and humans must install fish ladders in dams to enable the salmon to get past. Other examples of anadromous fishes are sea trout, three-spined stickleback, sea lamprey and shad.

Several Pacific salmon (Chinook, coho and Steelhead) have been introduced into the US Great Lakes, and have become potamodromous, migrating between their natal waters to feeding grounds entirely within fresh water.

Remarkable catadromous migrations are made by freshwater eels. Examples are the American eel and the European eel which migrate huge distances from freshwater rivers to spawn in the Sargasso Sea, and whose subsequent larvae can drift in currents for months and even years before returning to their natal rivers and streams as glass eels or elvers.

An example of a euryhaline species is the bull shark, which lives in Lake Nicaragua of Central America and the Zambezi River of Africa. Both these habitats are fresh water, yet bull sharks will also migrate to and from the ocean. Specifically, Lake Nicaragua bull sharks migrate to the Atlantic Ocean and Zambezi bull sharks migrate to the Indian Ocean.

Diel vertical migration is a common behavior; many marine species move to the surface at night to feed, then return to the depths during daytime.

A number of large marine fishes, such as the tuna, migrate north and south annually, following temperature variations in the ocean. These are of great importance to fisheries.

Freshwater (potamodromous) fish migrations are usually shorter, typically from lake to stream or vice versa, for spawning purposes. However, potamodromous migrations of the endangered Colorado pikeminnow of the Colorado River system can be extensive. Migrations to natal spawning grounds can easily be 100 km, with maximum distances of 300 km reported from radiotagging studies. Colorado pikeminnow migrations also display a high degree of homing and the fish may make upstream or downstream migrations to reach very specific spawning locations in whitewater canyons.

Sometimes fish can be dispersed by birds that eat fish eggs. They carry eggs in the digestive tracts and then deposit them in their faeces in a new place. The survival rate for fish eggs that have passed through a bird&#x27;s digestive tract is low.

==Historic exploitation==
Since prehistoric times humans have exploited certain anadromous fishes during their migrations into freshwater streams, when they are more vulnerable to capture. Societies dating to the Millingstone Horizon are known which exploited the anadromous fishery of Morro Creek and other Pacific coast estuaries. In Nevada the Paiute tribe has harvested migrating Lahontan cutthroat trout along the Truckee River since prehistoric times. This fishing practice continues to current times, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has supported research to assure the water quality in the Truckee can support suitable populations of the Lahontan cutthroat trout.

== Myxovirus genes ==
Because salmonids live an anadromous lifestyle, they encounter a larger range of viruses from both freshwater and marine ecosystems. Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are part of a GTP-ase family that aid in viral immunity, and previously, rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;) had been shown to possess three different Mx genes to aid in viral defence in both environments. The number of Mx genes can differ among species of fish, with numbers ranging from 1 to 9 and some outliers like Gadiformes that have totally lost their Mx genes. A study was performed by Wang et al. (2019) to identify more potential Mx genes that resided in rainbow trout. An additional six Mx genes were identified in that study, now named Mx4-9. They also concluded that the trout Mx genes were &quot;differentially expressed constitutively in tissues&quot; and that this expression is increased during development. The Mx gene family is expressed at high levels in the blood and intestine during development, suggesting they are a key to immune defense for the growing fish. The idea that these genes play an important role in development against viruses suggests they are critical in the trout&#x27;s success in an anadromous lifestyle.

<text>Yaroslavl (; , ) is a city and the administrative center of Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, located northeast of Moscow. The historic part of the city is a World Heritage Site, and is located at the confluence of the Volga and the Kotorosl rivers. It is part of the Golden Ring, a group of historic cities northeast of Moscow that have played an important role in Russian history. Population: 

==History==
Reportedly the capital of an independent Principality of Yaroslavl from 1218, it was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1463.

In the 17th century, it was Russia&#x27;s second-largest city, and for a time (during the Polish occupation of Moscow in 1612), the country&#x27;s de facto capital. Today, Yaroslavl is an important industrial center (petrochemical plant, tire manufacturing plant, diesel engines plant and many others). It developed at the confluence of major rivers, which were important for transportation and, later, for power. Because of the city&#x27;s importance, several major railways and later highways were constructed to intersect here.

===Early Yaroslavl===
The oldest settlement in the city is to be found on the left bank of the Volga River in front of the Strelka (a small cape at the confluence of the Volga and Kotorosl); this dates from the 5th–3rd millennium BCE.

In the 9th century the so-called Russian Khaganate formed, near Yaroslavl, a large Scandinavian-Slavic settlement in Timerevo. It is known for a surviving range of burial mounds. When excavations were carried out, a large number of artifacts, including Scandinavian weapons with runic inscriptions, chess pieces, and the largest collection of Arabian coins (treasure) in northern Europe (the earliest were struck in the first Idrisid), were found. In Timerevo the fourth set of Scandinavian brooches ever found in Russia was discovered. Apparently, this &quot;proto-Yaroslavl&quot; was a major center for the Volga trade route. Soon after the founding of Yaroslavl, the settlement went into decline, probably in connection with the termination of the operation of the Volga trade route. Upstream of the Volga River, just outside the boundaries of the modern city, archaeologists have studied a large necropolis with a predominance of ordinary graves of the Finno-Ugric-type.

===Foundation of the city===
Based on its earliest date of foundation, Yaroslavl is the oldest of all the existing towns on the Volga. Yaroslavl was founded by Yaroslav the Wise, a prince of Kievan Rus&#x27;, during the period of his ruling the Principality of Rostov (988—1010) when he stepped ashore for the first time near the area now known as &#x27;Strelka.&#x27; This is used as a contemporary park. On this spot, which was well protected from attack by the high, steep banks of the Volga, Kotorosl and Medveditsa rivers, Yaroslavl and his men began to set about building the first Yaroslavl Kremlin. The first recorded event of Yaroslavl occurred as a result of famine; it was recorded as the Rostov Uprising of 1071. The name of the city is traditionally linked to that of its founder: Yaroslav.

By the 12th century, the Petropavlovsky and Spaso-Preobrazhensky monasteries of Yaroslavl had already been developed. At that time, they were located well beyond the city limits, but the city later grew to encompass these institutions. During its first two centuries, Yaroslavl remained a minor fortified city of the Rostov-Suzdal lands.

From the beginning of the thirteenth century, Yaroslavl was ruled by the lordship of Konstantin and became one of his primary residences. Just before his death in 1218, Konstantin broke up his land among his various sons, bequeathing the Yaroslave land to his second son Vsevolod. The son ruled it as the Principality of Yaroslavl. This principality, of which Yaroslavl became the capital, included a number of territories to the north and operated independently until its eventual absorption in 1463 into the Principality of Moscow.

During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, Yaroslavl was a city largely built from wood, as a result of which it often found itself plagued by disastrous fires, which in some cases almost destroyed the entire city, a good example of which would be that which took place just before the transfer of power in the city to Vsevolod on 1221. Another constant source of danger for the city and for the many Russian princes of the time came from the East and the many foreign invaders, usually from the Mongol Horde. A particularly successful attack took place in 1257, when troops from the Golden Horde under Möngke Khan overran the Principality of Yaroslavl and murdered both the larger population of the area and the prince&#x27;s close family. On the site of that unfortunate event, on the right bank of the Kotorosl, there is now a memorial church and cross. A mass grave containing at least 300 bodies of victims of a Mongol invasion in the year 1238, was discovered during an excavation in 2005.

In 1293 and 1322 there were further disastrous attacks on Yaroslavl launched by the Golden Horde, and in 1278 and 1364 the Plague struck. On many an occasion Yaroslavl had to be completely rebuilt, both in terms of residential buildings which no longer exist, to those larger more permanent structures which remain to this day, such as the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery and 1314 Monastery of Maria of Tolga, which is located on the left bank of the Volga. In 1463 the Principality of Yaroslavl was finally absorbed into the Grand-duchy of Moscow, with the area it once covered becoming an oblast within the new structure of the Muscovite state. From this point onwards the history of the city and its lands became completely inseparable from that of Moscow and eventually Russia.

===16th century and the Time of Troubles===
Even in the 16th century, Yaroslavl continued to suffer from large scale fires and the damage they did to the city&#x27;s developing economy and infrastructure. As a result, the age old tradition of building in wood was abandoned and a new city built of stone began to appear; unfortunately, this meant that very little of the Yaroslavl of the Middle Ages remained unchanged. The most prominent example of this is the Spaso-Preobrazhensky monastery which was destroyed in 1501 and rebuilt in just under a few years. Resultantly the monastery&#x27;s cathedral was built up in 1506–1516, a building which remains, to this day, the oldest unchanged building in the city. By the middle of the sixteenth century, a number of other building works had been completed in the monastery, also, other than this, for the first time in its history, Yaroslavl gained a stone-built wall with a number of large watchtowers which were intended to be used to spot attackers from miles away. During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, when all the Russian principalities gave up their traditional rights and submitted to the Tsardom of Russia, the two large monasteries of Yaroslavl profited very much from rich gifts from the court of the Tsar, largely because Ivan IV made a number of pilgrimages to Yaroslavl over the course of his life.

New building works were also made affordable by a large upswing in Yaroslavl&#x27;s economic fortunes which the city experienced in the middle part of the 16th century. The main reason for this largely unexpected improvement in Yaroslavl&#x27;s fortunes came largely from the city&#x27;s position on the Volga which allowed trade to be brought from and to Moscow via the river, linking the new Russian capital with the port of Archangelsk darstellte. Resultantly Yaroslavl became an important place for the conduct of international trade and a number of shipping berths and warehouses grew up around the city for the use of merchants, especially those from England and Germany.

The economic prosperity of Yaroslavl during the late 16th century was put to an end by the unsteady years of troubles which lasted from around 1598 until 1613. Like most Russian cities of the time, Yaroslavl was devastated by famine and became a potential target city for Polish-Lithuanian troops acting in their capacity as &#x27;interventionists&#x27; in the troubled Russian state. The Polish-Lithuanian-supported pretender to the Russian throne captured Karachev, Bryansk, and other towns, was reinforced by the Poles, and in the spring of 1608 advanced upon Moscow, routing the army of Tsar Vasily Shuisky at Bolkhov. Promises of the wholesale confiscation of the estates of the boyars drew many common people to his side. The village of Tushino, twelve versts from the capital, was converted into an armed camp where Dmitry gathered his army. Resultantly this pretender won the appreciation of the powers in Yaroslavl and thus their loyalty. However, despite having promised to pay a higher rate of taxes and dues to the Polish occupiers, Yaroslavl was on numerous occasions plundered by the forces of the pretender Dmitry. This led to a number of popular uprisings. Thus in early 1609, a Russian peasant army was formed to free as many of the Volga&#x27;s cities as possible, including, among others, Vologda and Yaroslavl.

In May 1609, another Polish army under the command of Aleksander Józef Lisowski tried to bring the strategically important city of Yaroslavl under the power of the invaders. However, the majority of the city&#x27;s citizens had withdrawn into the center of the city and found refuge behind the protective earthen wall, thus denying the Poles entry without a fight. Yet even when Lisowski successfully (through deceit) managed to get behind this wall, he found that the citizens of Yaroslavl had retreated into their ancient wooden Kremlin and the two stone-built monasteries. The ensuing siege of Yaroslavl lasted until 22 May, but despite constant attempts to take the city, the Poles had to return to Moscow having not fulfilled their duty to bring Yaroslavl under direct control of their command.

Despite their failure at Yaroslavl, Polish forces remained in control of Moscow, and despite an attempt in 1610 by the Russian peasants&#x27; army to unseat the Poles from the Moscow Kremlin, little was accomplished and there seemed no end in sight for the occupation of the Russian tsardom. One year later, however, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky founded yet another peasants&#x27; army in Nizhny Novgorod, that on the way to Moscow, found itself stationed in Yaroslavl for many months. In this time from April to June 1612, Yaroslavl became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Russia, since in this place the most important matters of state were settled until the eventual liberation of Moscow came. After its time in Yaroslavl the peasants&#x27; army moved on towards Moscow, and with thanks to the rest and help they had received voluntarily from the people of Yaroslavl, the army was able to liberate Moscow and finally put an end to the Polish-Lithuanian &#x27;intervention&#x27; in the affairs of the Russian state.

===Trading post and government center===
With the general economic revival of the Russian state&#x27;s economy after the end of the Troubles, Yaroslavl continued to be an important trading post and retained its place on the route of numerous traditional trading routes from the West to East and vice versa. By way of the Volga trade was carried out with the lands of the Orient. The northern trade route through the city ran to the port of Arkhangelsk in Russia&#x27;s far north, whilst other Eastern trade lines ran East over the Urals to Siberia. The town benefited very much from its geographical location over the years and the wealth which business produced for the town helped ensure its prosperous future. In fact, in the 17th century, a number of early industrial concerns were set up in the city, including a number of leather-working shops, in which around 700 people eventually came to work. Other trades for which Yaroslavl became a center over the years were in the production of textiles, cosmetics (fragrances) and silver work.

As a result of the prosperity enjoyed by the city, Yaroslavl saw a huge expansion in the size of its population over the course of the 17th century, and by the end of this century, the town had a population of around 15,000 people, making it the second-largest city of the Russian Tsardom after Moscow. This period was also particularly important for the urban development of the city because during the 17th century a multitude of stone-walled churches were built in the city; today these churches still form a major part of the old town&#x27;s city center. Work on most of these churches was begun with funds gifted to the city by rich local merchants, and thus they had a large say in what form the buildings would eventually take.

In 1658, Yaroslavl endured a disastrous fire that destroyed most of the city&#x27;s few remaining wooden buildings, including the ancient Kremlin. From this point onwards the city began to develop in the same way as it has done up to this very day, as a city built almost exclusively out of brick and mortar.

At the beginning of the 18th century Yaroslavl finally began to transform itself from a trading post into a major industrial town; this largely came about because with the foundation by Peter the Great of Saint Petersburg in 1703, the importance of Arkhangelsk as a port on the Northern Ocean was drastically decreased, and the amount of trade being channeled through the city for export fell accordingly. Luckily, the wealth which Yaroslavl had amassed over its many years as an important trading post allowed it to invest great amounts of money into the development of the city&#x27;s new industrial base, and thus make the city very attractive to new investors. In 1772 the textiles factory of Ivan Tames opened on the right bank of the Kotorosl. This plant was not only Yaroslavl&#x27;s first major industrial enterprise but also one of Russia&#x27;s largest textiles producers. The establishment still exists today under the name &#x27;Textile factory &#x27;Krasny Perekop&#x27; (russ. ). In addition to the rise in textile manufacturing, Yaroslavl&#x27;s traditional position as a center for skilled leatherwork remained unchanged.

In the 1770s, as a result of the city&#x27;s economic development and ever-rising population, the city became a major provincial center, thus in the course of the Russian Empire&#x27;s administrative reforms under Catherine the Great Yaroslavl, in 1777, became the center of its own governorate, and in 1778 received its own grant of arms. In 1796, the city finally became the seat of one of the Empire&#x27;s new governorates. As an administrative center of the highest order, Yaroslavl, in 1778, received its own plan for urban development specially drawn out by Ivan Starov. This led to another wave of building works in the city, the results of which are still visible in the city today. With the Ilyinskaya Square and Church of Elijah the Prophet at its center, the new plan called for the development of a network of long boulevards and streets that would be bordered by large classical-style buildings and numerous city parks. A prominent example of this later development is the former House of Charity (built in 1786), which is now one of the buildings of the city&#x27;s &#x27;Demidov&#x27; State University.

For Yaroslavl, the 19th meant a period of intensive building work, infrastructural development and industrialization. In 1803 the &#x27;School of Higher Sciences&#x27; was opened, this was the city&#x27;s first educational institute and is recognized as the forerunner to the city&#x27;s current state university. In 1812 the first permanent bridge (built near the Transfiguration Monastery) over the Kotorosl was finished, and by 1820 the city&#x27;s Volga embankment was stabilized and turned into a large shaded promenade. Also, other major classicist building works were started, among which was the Governor&#x27;s House (1821–1823) (today location of the city&#x27;s gallery). In 1860 Yaroslavl was finally connected, through Moscow, via telegraph to the other major cities of Russia, and this was then soon followed, in 1870, by the building of Yaroslavl&#x27;s first railway station and inauguration of Yaroslavl-Moscow railway. In 1873 the city gained municipal waterworks and by 1900 an electrified tramway. Just before the end of the 19th century in 1897, Yaroslavl had a recorded population of around 71,600 people.

===20th century and millennium===
Right up until the beginning of the First World War Yaroslavl remained a large industrial town with a well-developed municipal infrastructure. However, the effects of the 1917 October Revolution were wide-reaching, and after the Russian Civil War of 1917–1920 the city&#x27;s economy suffered rather drastically; this led to a significant contraction of the city&#x27;s population. The Yaroslavl Rebellion, which lasted from 6 to 21 July 1918 had particularly grave consequences. In this event, a group of conservative activists tried to remove the newly installed Bolshevik municipal authorities through an armed intervention. The rebels managed to secure a number of large parts of the city, however, this led only to an assault by the Red Army which saw the city surrounded, cut off from supplies and bombarded day and night with artillery and air forces. The rebellion was eventually put down, and ended with official figures putting the number of deaths among the city&#x27;s residents at about 600, in addition to which around 2,000 of the city&#x27;s buildings were either destroyed or badly damaged.

The economy of Yaroslavl took part in the early Soviet Union&#x27;s program of accelerated industrialization. Milestones for this period include the opening of the city&#x27;s first municipal power plant in 1926, the beginning of Synthetic rubber mass production in factory &quot;SK-1&quot;, the reestablishment of domestic production facilities for the production of automobile and aircraft tires in the 1928-founded Yaroslavl Tyre Factory, and the opening of the rubber-asbestos combined works in 1933. In addition to all this, the Yaroslavl Automobile Works (founded 1916) continued to produce vehicles, including a number for the municipal transport administration of Moscow, well into the 1930s.

During the years of World War II, Yaroslavl managed to escape the prospect of German occupation, since the Wehrmacht did not manage to break through the Soviet defense lines surrounding Moscow. However, due to its location as a large transportation hub, and since the 1913-built railway bridge over the Volga in Yaroslavl was the only point at which to cross the river, the city became a major target for air raids during 1942–1943. During one of the heaviest of all these raids on 11 June 1943, over 120 of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were killed, while another 150 or so were badly injured. In addition to this around 200 buildings (including one of the tire factory&#x27;s main workshops) were completely destroyed. Most of the city&#x27;s industry, including the automobile, tyre and textile plants, were converted, during the war, to produce armament and equipment for the Soviet Red Army. Overall about 200,000 people from the Yaroslavl area died on the fronts during World War II. This sacrifice is today memorialized through a monument and eternal flame which was opened near the mouth of the Kotorosl River in 1968.

During the Blockade of Leningrad a great number of children, who were brought over the frozen Lake Ladoga (the so-called Road of life) were evacuated to a safer new life in Yaroslavl. Yaroslavl was at the time also home to a camp for military prisoners of war &#x27;Camp No. 276&#x27; for German soldiers imprisoned for taking part in hostilities against the Soviet Union.

In the second half of the century, the industrialization and development of the city took the foremost position in Yaroslavl&#x27;s history, including the opening of Yaroslavl Refinery in 1961. Beginning in the 1960s, the city began to open up and a large number of residential districts began to spring up all over the city, including, for the first time in the city&#x27;s history, on the left bank of the Volga, where development had traditionally not taken place. This left-bank development was further encouraged by the construction, in 1965, of a new Volga crossing for automobiles. In 1968 the city&#x27;s population finally rose, for the first time, to over half a million inhabitants; it has been growing, almost constantly, ever since.

In July 2005 Yaroslavl&#x27;s historic city center was inscribed onto the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The support for this was in line with the list&#x27;s second (a unique example of the combining of cultural and architectural styles between Western Europe and the Russian Empire) and fourth (a unique example of urban development influenced by the Municipal Planning Reform in Russia of Empress Catherine the Great 1763–1830). In the same year, the preparations for the celebration of the millennium of Yaroslavl&#x27;s foundation began; this was finally celebrated on the second weekend in September 2010. Under the conditions of the preparations for the city&#x27;s 1000th anniversary, the municipal authorities invested a great deal of money into the development of the city&#x27;s road and rail infrastructure, much of the funds for which were granted by the federal government in Moscow. Included in these preparations was the opening of a new bridge (in 2006) over the Volga; this is now known as the Jubilee Bridge. Also in August 2008, the newly built Yaroslavl Zoo was opened; this was then expanded further in 2010.

In 2009, Yaroslavl became a meeting place for global policy debates within the International Conference &#x27;The Modern State and Global Security&#x27;. AKA Yaroslavl Global Policy Forum. The conference in Yaroslavl gathered the most authoritative representatives of political science, business community as well as the representatives of the governments of a number of different states. Dmitry Medvedev, President of the Russian Federation, José Luis Zapatero, Prime Minister of Spain and François Fillon, Prime Minister of France were all participants at the Conference.

In 2010, Russian officials gathered together with international authorities in Yaroslavl to discuss the challenges facing the modern state at the Global Policy Forum for &#x27;The Modern State: Standards of Democracy and Criteria of Efficiency&#x27;. In 2011 Yaroslavl will bring together participants from all over the world to discuss the 2011 agenda: &#x27;The modern state in the age of social diversity&#x27;.

On September 7, 2011, most of the members of the city&#x27;s KHL (ice hockey) team, Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, perished in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash on takeoff from Yaroslavl&#x27;s Tunoshna Airport. Germans crossed the Moscow - Volga Canal in 1941 and briefly got into Yaroslavl, also they bombed it on and off in 1941-3 and with V1 and with V2 Rockets in 1941–5, the Abwehr attacked the City in 1941–5.

==Geography==

===Location===
The city lies in the eastern portion of Yaroslavl Oblast. The nearest large towns are Tutayev ( to the northwest), Gavrilov-Yam ( to the south), and Nerekhta ( to the southeast). The historic center of Yaroslavl lies to the north of the mouth of the Kotorosl River on the right bank of the larger Volga River. The city&#x27;s entire urban area covers around and includes a number of territories south of the Kotorosl and on the left bank of the Volga.

With nearly 600,000 residents, Yaroslavl is, by population, the largest town on the Volga until it reaches Nizhny Novgorod. It is a large transport node, and a great number of important national and regional roads, railways, and waterways pass through the city. Many of the roads that connect Yaroslavl to Moscow and beyond are two-lane highways.

Yaroslavl and its respective oblast are located in the central area of the East European Plain, which in areas to the northeast of Moscow is characterized by rolling hills and a generally uneven landscape; however, most of these hills are no larger than in height. Typical for this region, the area in and around Yaroslavl is rich in mixed and coniferous forests. In addition to these, there are also large areas of swampland.

===Climate===
Yaroslavl and its local area have a typical temperate continental climate, in comparison to central and western Europe. This makes for a climate of snowier, colder, and drier winters, and typically temperate, warmer summers.

The winter weather in Yaroslavl begins in about November and usually goes on for five months, into spring. The coldest month of the year is typically January, with an average temperature of . However, at this time it is not uncommon for temperatures to drop below . In some cases (for example, most recently in January 2006), temperatures of can be experienced. Record low is . On the other hand, Yaroslavl can also experience positive temperatures during this time of the year (for example, in 1932, when a thaw lasted for seventeen days of January). Typically the Volga freezes over during the winter. Snow cover is usually , but can in some cases be up to in depth. The springtime months are best characterized by a typical lack of precipitation. Precipitation in April is low - 30–40 mm; its increase begins in May, when more than 50 mm of precipitation falls. May has the lowest relative humidity of the year - about 70%. From the end of March into April, there is often a thaw, and much of the ice and snow melts to reveal foliage underneath. It is not uncommon for temperatures in April to reach . Summers in Yaroslavl are typically wet with some heavy rainstorms. The summer often reaches its hottest point during the months of June/July, and often days over . From September begins the two-month-long fall, which is characterized by relatively high humidity, fewer sunny days, and unpredictable temperatures (it is possible to first see ground frost in September). The average amount of precipitation during a year is , of which (the most precipitation in one month) falls in July. The very least precipitation occurs in winter and spring (particularly in February and March).

The following figures for precipitation and temperature values in Yaroslavl have been collated on the basis of data from the years 1961–1990.

==Symbols==

Yaroslavl currently has a coat of arms and a flag which are both made up of two heraldic symbols. Both of these items are intrinsically linked with the legend surrounding the foundation of the city; the bear and halberd.

The first coat of arms of Yaroslavl was officially granted on August 31, 1778. At that time it was made up of a silver field upon which the form of a bear was placed, and which, with its left forepaw held a golden halberd. In 1856 the coat of arms was modified slightly, which left the traditional image of the halberd-carrying bear as it was but added an imperial crown surmounted on top of the shield. In addition to this a sprig of golden oak leaves was added to surround the shield, intertwined with the blue ribbon of the Order of Saint Andrew. This form of the coat of arms was then left unaltered until 1918, just after the Bolsheviks came to power as a result of the October Revolution. After the abolition of the Tsarist municipal and provincial symbols by the newly installed Soviet administration in Yaroslavl, the city received no new official symbols, and thus the situation remained until the end of the twentieth century. The third and current version of the city&#x27;s coat of arms was adopted on August 23, 1995 by the municipal council. The coloring and form of the arms are taken from those of 1856; however, the sprig of oak and ribbon of St. Andrew were removed and have not yet been reintroduced to the symbols of the city. In addition to this, the imperial crown which previously surmounted the whole design has been replaced, in the current version by the Cap of Monomakh—a symbol of the Russian autocracy and an otherwise powerful symbol of the Russian state.

The flag of Yaroslavl was adopted on May 22, 1996. It is a simple design that depicts the coat of arms of the city (1995 version), which must take up at least one-third of the flag&#x27;s entire size, upon a light blue background. The whole flag is rectangular in shape.

== Population ==
According to the 2021 All-Russian Population Census, as of October 1, 2021, the city was in 27th place in terms of population out of 1117  cities of the Russian Federation.

The share of Yaroslavl in the population of the region is 47.88%. Population density: 2805.05 people. per km2.

=== Demographics ===
==Politics==

The local government of Yaroslavl consists of the Mayoralty, the head of which is the mayor, and the Municipal Council, the members of which may cast votes at council meetings.

The mayoralty plays the role of the executive in the city&#x27;s municipal administration. The mayor is elected by the city&#x27;s electorate for four years in a direct election.

Between December 1991 and April 2012 this office has been held by Viktor Volonchunas, a member of the United Russia party.

In April 2012, Yevgeny Urlashov was elected the new mayor. However, on July 3, 2013, he was detained by police on charges of bribery extortion. On July 18, 2013, he was officially removed from his post and replaced with acting mayor Alexander Nechayev.

On November 7, 2022 Artyom Vladimirovich Molchanov was elected as the new mayor of the city.

The Municipal Council of the city makes up the administration&#x27;s legislative branch, thus effectively making it a city &#x27;parliament&#x27; or city duma. The municipal council is made up of 36 elected members, who represent a certain district of the city for a four-year term. In the regular meetings of the municipal council, problems facing the city are discussed, and annually the city&#x27;s budget is drawn up. The council also has a court of audit and four standing committees.

Each of the city&#x27;s six districts has its own district administration, all of which are ultimately part of the city&#x27;s administration.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Yaroslavl serves as the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Yaroslavsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Yaroslavl—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Yaroslavl is incorporated as Yaroslavl Urban Okrug.

===City divisions===
Yaroslavl is divided into six city districts. The center is located on the northern bank of the Kotorosl River, where it converges with the Volga on the Volga&#x27;s western bank. The center is the economic and political hub of the city. It is also the oldest district in the city and where it was first settled. The center contains the majority of landmarks and attractions in the city, including the Volkov Theater, the Church of Elijah the Prophet, the football stadium, and the Volga embankment and the monastery, which is often mistakenly called the kremlin. Pyatyorka is located north of the center but is still under its administrative jurisdiction. Pyatyorka is largely a residential region with very few notable sites, aside from a few houses of culture.

Across the Kotorosl lie Frunzensky and Krasnoperekopsky City Districts, which are divided by Moskovsky Avenue. Frunzensky is a relatively new district, constructed in the post-war era. Most of the buildings are of typical grey Soviet construction. Frunzensky City District is divided into three microdistricts: Suzdalka, Dyadkovo, and Lipovaya Gora.

Krasnoperekopsky City District is one of the oldest parts in Yaroslavl. Before the 1917 Revolution, it was home to the bulk of Yaroslavl&#x27;s industry, and a good deal of industry remains today. Krasnoperekopsky City District is divided into two micro-districts, one of which is Neftestroy, an up-and-coming region, named for its proximity to the Yaroslavl Refinery. Neftestroy is home to the newly built hockey arena, and there were plans to build an indoor football stadium there by the millennial anniversary of Yaroslavl&#x27;s founding in 2010. On the other side of the railway tracks that run through Krasnopereposky City District lies the Perekop proper. Today, Perekop is known as one of the most dangerous areas of Yaroslavl. It consists largely of run-down, pre-Soviet izbas and decaying factory buildings. There are plans to pump life into this depressed district, but at the time of writing, it remains extremely impoverished and dangerous. Much of Yaroslavl&#x27;s mafia grew out of Perekop. Perekop has some of Yaroslavl&#x27;s most notable churches, including the Church of Saint John the Baptist, which is located next to a paint factory on the Kotorosl embankment; and Peter and Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, a Protestant-style Orthodox church.

North of the center there is a small industrial region, which is home to the tire factory, the engine plant, as well as many other smaller factories. Further north on the Western bank lies Dzerzhinsky City District, named after &quot;Iron&quot; Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police. Dzerzhinsky City District&#x27;s core micro-district is Bragino, named after a small village that was eventually consumed by Yaroslavl&#x27;s post-war expansion. Bragino is the largest area in Yaroslavl in terms of population, but like Frunzensky City District, it is largely a residential area, mostly consisting of middle- to lower-middle-income families.

On the other bank of the Volga lies Zavolzhsky City District. This city district was Yaroslavl&#x27;s quietest and most-rural area, but now it is one of the most dynamic parts of the city with expansive new buildings with big hypermarkets, such as &quot;Globus&quot; and &quot;Real&quot;. Birch and evergreen forests separate the apartment blocks.

==Travel and culture==
Yaroslavl is one of the eight cities of Russia&#x27;s Golden Ring, a group of touristic, historic towns around Moscow. Yaroslavl is situated on the north-eastern side of this &#x27;ring&#x27; and is the largest city in its chain. While the city is best known for its architectural merits, it also has a relatively large repertoire of cultural attractions.

===Architecture===

Despite the effects of the Russian Civil War and a number of air-raids during World War II, the city of Yaroslavl has managed to retain a great deal of its 17th, 18th and 19th-century urban substance. This has helped make the city recognized as a monument to the architectural development and style of the Russian Tsardom. The center of the city, which covers an area of around 600 hectares has around 140 individual federally-protected architectural monuments. Since 2005, this ensemble, along with the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery has been included on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Despite all this, there are a number of buildings of architectural merit which are located outside of the city center.

====Old town====
The old town is effectively triangular in shape; this triangle is formed by the natural border provided to the south and east by the Kotorosl and Volga rivers, and on the land side by the geometric pattern of the street plan, which dates from the 18th and 19th centuries.

Constructed in 1506–1516 on the foundations of the original edifice dating back to 1216–1224. In the 16th century, the first stone wall is built around the monastery. It is from this monastery that an army of volunteers led by Minin and Prince Pozharsky set out to liberate Moscow from Polish invaders. In 1787, the monastery was closed and converted into a residence of the Yaroslavl and Rostov bishops. At that time, monastery buildings began to be reconstructed. New cells and the prior&#x27;s chambers were built.

The most well-known building in the city is the &#x27;Spaso-Preobrazhensky&#x27; (&#x27;Transfiguration of the Savior&#x27;) Cathedral of the Spassky (St Savior) Monastery (russ. ). This monastery was founded in the 12th century and thus it, and its cathedral, is the oldest buildings in the city. The Transfiguration Cathedral itself, built in 1516, is the oldest detached building standing in the city, (). Typical for a Russian monastery of the Middle Ages, the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery in Yaroslavl was built to be not a place of worship, but also to be a citadel and kremlin in case, in times of war, there was a need for such a facility. This is still visible today as the monastery is surrounded by a thick 16th century, white-painted wall, complete with watchtowers and embattlements. Within these walls stand the magisterial churches, which, with their asymmetrically ordered towers and decorated interiors, make for examples of traditional Russian sacral architecture. In addition to this, there is a gatehouse church, with which the monastery&#x27;s dungeons and treasury were connected. The monastery has long had a place in the history of Yaroslavl and continues, albeit nowadays as a museum, to play a role in the life of the city. It was largely thanks to the impregnability of the monastery that, during the time of the Troubles, the Russian peasants&#x27; army was able to defend the city and then go on to liberate Moscow from its Polish-Lithuanian occupiers. At the end of the 18th century, the oldest known text of the Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign, the most renowned work of Russian-language literature from the Middle Ages, was found in the library of the SPaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery. This work is now on display as a permanent exhibition within the monastery, along with other works of the age and an exhibition showing the conditions an author of the era would have lived in.

The often hectic square which is to be found just beyond the north gate of the monastery (main gate), is called Bogolavyenskaya Square (Epiphany Square) (). This name comes from the nearby &quot;Epiphany Church&quot; () which is seated at the south end of the square, near the bank of the Kotorosl. This church, with its five domes, and traditional Russian sacral architecture, is a classic example of a medieval Russian church. However, the church has a separate clock tower which was built in accordance with the sacral-architectural style of Muscovy in the years 1684–1693; this all goes to make the church one of the most noticeable examples of 17th-century architecture in the city. In addition to this, the fresco-work inside the church was carried out by local artists during the building of the church and has remained, almost unchanged, to this day.

The two streets which lead off Bogolavyenskaya Square to the northwest are very good examples of the type of urban planning which was formulated for Yaroslavl in the 18th and 19th centuries. They were laid out in 1820–1821 as new boulevards to run around the historic city center and were built on terrain previously occupied by a number of earthen and wooden fortifications which dated from the 16th century. There was also a small defensive moat in this area, and after the infilling of the moat and removal of all other fortifications, the defensive uses of the Spaso-Preobrazhensky monastery largely disappeared. This was, in general, not considered to be a great loss, as the requirement for such earthworks in order to maintain defensive readiness had long since been surpassed by other methods of securing a city by the point of their removal. The two municipal watchtowers which have been retained (the Vassily tower and Volzhskaya tower) were both positioned on the city&#x27;s outer defensive walls which afforded them clear views of oncoming enemy forces.

Within the old defensive limits of the city, one can find many other examples of classicism, one important example of which would be the municipal trade rows &#x27;Gostiny Dvor&#x27; () – these were built in 1813–1818, not long after the clearing of the land upon which they now stand. The style of the building, made noticeable by its many Ionic columns, is similar to that of many Russian trade rows and market halls built in the early to mid-19th century, all over the country. This style is also very complementary to the 1911-built neoclassical Volkov Theater. At the end of Komsomolskaya Boulevard, upon which the trade rows are located, one finds themselves at &#x27;Volkov Square&#x27; (); where the ring-boulevard makes a slight deviation to the north-eat and carries on towards &#x27;Red Square&#x27; () and the city&#x27;s Volga embankment. Yaroslavl&#x27;s Red Square does not have the same etymology as the likewise-named Red Square in Moscow (the name of which stems from the old-Russian for &#x27;beautiful square&#x27;), rather in Yaroslavl&#x27;s case, its Red Square was first so-called in the 1920s, and was officially named in honor of the Soviet Red Guards. There are a number of buildings of historical interest on Red Square, one of which is the three-story building on the square&#x27;s north side which once housed Yaroslavl&#x27;s &#x27;aristocrat&#x27;s meeting house&#x27; (), and is now the main building for the city&#x27;s &#x27;Demidov&#x27; State University. Furthermore, the square is also the location where the city&#x27;s main fire department can be found; this is contained within a jugendstil building, built in 1911, and which has a large look-out tower, which even until the 1970s was actively used by the city&#x27;s fire brigade.

To the east of the boulevard, within the borders of the former defensive earthworks, the architecturally-rich &#x27;nucleus&#x27; of the old city is to be found; an area crisscrossed by many narrow, small streets, in the middle of which one of Yaroslavl&#x27;s most well-recognized architectural monuments is to be found. This is the Church of Elijah the Prophet (), which, in the same way as the Epiphany Church, is a very prominent example of the way in which the city developed in the 17th century. Before the completion of the church which currently stands in 1650, a number of other predecessor churches stood on this spot. From these, the oldest dates back to the foundation of Yaroslavl and the reign of Yaroslav the Wise. The church, with its five onion domes, is a cross and dome-style church, the architecture of which is typical of Muscovite designs, is particularly well known for its interior fresco paintings, which, despite a history which has seen great fires and disasters, have been kept in good condition. The frescos on the walls and ceilings were painted by around fifteen experienced artists from Yaroslavl and Kostroma around the year 1680. The fresco-work is festooned with many references to the Old Testament. The square, upon which the church, with its clock tower and neighboring chapel, is situated, was in the early 19th century, according to the city&#x27;s urban plan, to be the central square of Yaroslavl and the place upon which markets and national holidays would take place. Nowadays it is an area largely reserved for official events, with the other buildings surrounding the square all belonging to the municipal administration.

In general, the streets of the city center are characterized by a noticeable mix of classical and sacral architecture. There are a number of major public and commercial buildings of architectural merit in the center of the city, among which are the 1785 &#x27;Governmental offices&#x27; building&#x27; () and the Vakromeyev House, which today houses the Yaroslavl Seminary for young priests. The Volga embankment is a good example of urban planning in the classicist style; built in the 1840s, this promenade walk has remained a favorite place for residents to take a stroll and relax ever since.

The southern part of the city center, around the area where the Kotorosl and Volga intersect, is an area abundant in green park-like spaces. Until the 17th century this area was occupied by the wooden Yaroslavl Kremlin and is thus referred to nowadays as &#x27;Wooden Town&#x27; (). The Kremlin burnt down in 1658 and was never rebuilt. Close by the 1642 Church of Maria () stood until its demolition in 1937, however, since 2004 the church was under reconstruction and was finally opened on 12 September 2010 by Patriarch of Moscow Kirill.

Yaroslavl is the site of the Volkov Theater (built 1750), the oldest theater in Russia, and the Demidovsky Pillar.

The city has many Russian Orthodox churches, one Russian Old Believers church, one Baptist church, one Lutheran church, one Armenian Apostolic church, one mosque and one synagogue.

Yaroslavl has three theaters, the most famous of which is the &#x27;Volkov Theater&#x27;, an institution which since 1911 has been housed in a large neoclassical building in the city&#x27;s old town. Named after its founder, Fyodor Volkov, the theater was first opened to the public in 1750, this making it Russia&#x27;s first (by official figures) theatre. The Volkov Theater still has a reputation for being one of Russia&#x27;s most pioneering dramatic institutes and is considered, among the Russian acting community, to be one of the most prestigious playhouses in which to perform. Even though Volkov&#x27;s original theater troop only performed in Yaroslavl for a few months before then moving to Saint Petersburg (there was no regular theater company in Yaroslavl again until the beginning of the 19th century), the town is still recognised as the spiritual home of the Russian theater and dramatics. Nowadays the Volkov Theater has two stages and a combined amount of around 1000 seats for spectators.

Apart from the Volkov Theater, there are a number of other theatres in Yaroslavl, including the State Puppet Theater (founded in 1927), a children&#x27;s and youth theater (Yaroslavl State Theater for Young Spectators, founded 1984), and the Yaroslavl Chamber Theater (founded 1999). In addition to these theaters, the city also has a philharmonic (founded 1937) and a permanent circus (founded 1963).

There are around ten movie theaters in the city, the oldest of which &#x27;Rodina&#x27; was built during the Soviet era in 1959. This particular theatre, despite maintaining its Soviet-era exterior, has been comprehensively modernised and is now even able to show 3D films. The city also has a number of large, modern multiplex cinemas, including those of the Russian cinema chains &quot;Cinema-Star&quot; and &quot;Kinomax&quot;.
Uncommon for a provincial Russian city, Yaroslavl has a large municipal Planetarium This was founded in 1948 and was situated, for a long time, in an old church. However, in April 2011, after two years of construction, the city&#x27;s new &#x27;Valentina Tereshkova&#x27; planetarium (named after the first female cosmonaut) was opened to the public.

===Global Policy Forum===

In recent years Yaroslavl has become well known for the high-level political discourse it has hosted under the auspices of the Yaroslavl Global Policy Forum. This event, organised by the Russian government, and with the backing of President Dmitry Medvedev, has been running since 2009 and represents one of the highest level political-diplomatic forums in the world today. It is the largest political science event organised in Russia and is held on an annual basis, with a number of foreign officials appearing as participants each year. For example, in the past, French and Italian prime ministers François Fillon and Silvio Berlusconi have been guests, as well as Spanish prime minister Jose Zapatero.

In 2011 Turkish president Abdullah Gül was received as a guest participant by the Russian authorities.

Yaroslavl was chosen to host the event due to its thousand-year history of being a meeting point for people of all cultures, a significant trading post, and its former status as Russia&#x27;s second-largest city, within which a great number of foreign embassies were situated. The award of this forum to the city coincided with the city&#x27;s millennium celebrations and thus it is commonly viewed by residents to have been a gift from the Russian president to the city which has helped raise the city&#x27;s global profile.

In 2011, this event became headline news in a number of countries due to the unfortunate events which led to the deaths of around forty people (players, support staff, and aircrew) from Yaroslavl&#x27;s &#x27;Lokomotiv&#x27; ice hockey team. President Medvedev was, at the time of the crash, attending the conference at Lokomotiv&#x27;s home stadium &#x27;Arena 2000&#x27;, and specially postponed a number of important meetings to make sure he could travel to the crash site and meet with crash victims&#x27; relatives. Later Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin also arrived in the city to pay his condolences.

==Education==

Yaroslavl has a large number of educational establishments which enclose all three levels of the Russian educational system: primary (ca. 20 establishments), middle (ca. 20 colleges and other secondary schools), and higher (8 state and 2 non-state funded higher educational institutions). In Yaroslavl, one can study for both masters&#x27; and bachelors&#x27; level courses.

Yaroslavl is currently home to the following state higher educational institutions: Yaroslavl &#x27;Demidov&#x27; State University, Yaroslavl State Technical University, Ushinskiy Pedagogical University, Yaroslavl State Medical Academy, Yaroslavl State Agricultural Academy, Yaroslavl State Institute for Theatrical Studies, Military School of Finance and Economics, and the Yaroslavl Higher School for Anti-Aircraft and Missile Defence. Amongst the non-state funded institutions for further education in the city is the International Academy for Business and New Technologies (MUBiNT), and also a number of branches from Moscow-based universities. In addition to these establishments, there is also the Yaroslavl Seminary, a large establishment for the training of new Russian Orthodox priests.

By the end of 2008 Yaroslavl had around 187 pre-school teaching and care groups registered within the city, within these there were around 22,700 places that were oversubscribed and thus filled by around 26,000 pre-school aged children. The number of registered children was around 78.7%, or around 0.4% more than in 2007. At the beginning of the 2008–9 academic year, the city had around 100 daytime general educational groups for children within which around 48,100 infants were registered. This figure was around 200 people less than in the previous year. According to the situation in 2010 around 16,000 people are to be found working in Yaroslavl&#x27;s educational sector.

==Transportation==
Yaroslavl is situated at the crossing point of a number of major automotive, rail, and riverboat routes. The M8 (Moscow–Yaroslavl–Vologda–Arkhangelsk) links the city to Moscow and also onwards to the north in the direction of Arkhangelsk. One major railway bridge and two automotive bridges (Oktyabrsky and Yubileyny Bridge) traverse the Volga River. The Kotorosl River is crossed by as many as four bridges for automobiles and one for railway traffic (built in 1896).

===Automotive transport===
In the last few years, the authorities of Yaroslavl have been acting on the initiative to build a bypass around the city. For this reason, the center of the city is now largely free of freight transporters and other larger vehicles transiting through the city. In August 2010, the first piece of this new bypass was opened, it included an interchange, which connects the Yubileyny Bridge with the Southwest Yaroslavl relief road.

There is one railway bridge across the Volga and two road bridges; the second road bridge across the Volga was ready for use in October 2006.

Interurban and regional bus services depart from and arrive at the city&#x27;s main bus terminal. The services run from this station serve a number of highly populated areas as well as other villages and smaller towns located within Yaroslavl Oblast such as Pereslavl-Zalessky, Rybinsk, and Uglich. Larger cities served include Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ufa, Kostroma, Kazan, and Cherepovets.

===Railway===
Yaroslavl is the major node of the Northern Railway (part of Russian Railways). Northern Railway headquarters are located on the city&#x27;s Volga Embankment. There are two major passenger railway stations: Yaroslavl-Glavny and Yaroslavl-Moskovsky serving many long-distance passenger trains. The city is connected to Moscow by a fast electric train service (sitting places only) named &#x27;Express&#x27;. Nearby areas are served by a network of suburban trains with electrified service to Danilov, Rostov, Alexandrov, Nerekhta, and Kostroma and diesel service to Rybinsk and Ivanovo.

===Air transport===
Yaroslavl&#x27;s main airport is Tunoshna International. It was built as a World War 2 airbase. The airport caters to a variety of aircraft types. Voronezh based Polet Flight provides several daily flights to Moscow&#x27;s Domodedovo International Airport.

There are also two smaller airports: Levtsovo Air Base and Karachikha air field. Levtsovo is primarily used for cargo-type aircraft and helicopters and rarely for passenger flights. The Yaroslavl Air Club, which is one of Russia&#x27;s oldest air clubs and where Valentina Tereshkova first began to attend flight training, is based at the Karachikha air field.

===Water transport===
Yaroslavl River Port has an annual import average of around 3.5 million tonnes of freight a year. Climatic conditions allow the port to be used for six months of the year, from May to later October. The river port caters not only for larger river cruise ships which stop off in the city as part of their journey up/down the Volga, but also to a number of regular services which link Yaroslavl with Breytovo, Tolga, Konstantinovo, Bakarevo, and Novye Chentsy.

===Public transportation===
The city has a network of public transportation, including buses, trolley-buses and tram lines. Below there is a table showing how many people used different types of transport in a number of given years (millions of people): 
Every day, over 600 different bus routes are run by a large consortium of both small and large buses and private shuttle buses.

The Yaroslavl tram system is one of the oldest in Russia and has been in existence since 1900. , this system is made up of four routes which run through various parts of the city. Starting in 2004 the number of routes run by trams throughout the city has been steadily reduced, and whilst in 2006 trams could be found in both the historic city center and the Krasnoperekopsky District, the routes serving these areas have now disappeared altogether. While at the beginning of the 21st century, the number of tramcars used by the Yaroslavl tram system stood at around 100, this has now fallen (by 2011) to just 43.

Since 1949, The city&#x27;s urban transport network has also run a fleet of trolleybuses that runs nine different routes.

==Sports==
FC Shinnik Yaroslavl is an association football club based in Yaroslavl. It plays in the Russian First Division.

Lokomotiv Yaroslavl is the city&#x27;s ice hockey team, which was the champion of Russia in 1996–1997, 2001–2002, and 2002–2003 seasons. On 7 September 2011, all players on the team were killed in the 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash, when the plane in which they were travelling for their first match of the season crashed on takeoff from Yaroslavl airport.
