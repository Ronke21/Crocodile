<text>Carly Elisabeth Simon (born June 25, 1943) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and author. She rose to fame in the 1970s with a string of hit records; her 13 Top 40 U.S. hits include &quot;Anticipation&quot; (No. 13), &quot;The Right Thing to Do&quot; (No. 17), &quot;Haven&#x27;t Got Time for the Pain&quot; (No. 14), &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (No. 6), &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; (No. 18), and her four Gold-certified singles &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; (No. 1), &quot;Mockingbird&quot; (No. 5, a duet with James Taylor), &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; (No. 2) from the 1977 James Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and &quot;Jesse&quot; (No. 11). She has authored two memoirs and five children&#x27;s books.

In 1963, Simon began performing with her sister Lucy Simon in the Simon Sisters. Their debut album, &quot;Meet the Simon Sisters&quot;, featured the song &quot;Winkin&#x27;, Blinkin&#x27; and Nod&quot;, based on the poem by Eugene Field and put to music by Lucy. The song became a minor hit and reached No. 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The duo would release two more albums: &quot;Cuddlebug&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Simon Sisters Sing for Children&quot; (1969). After Lucy left the group, Carly found great success as a solo artist with her 1971 self-titled debut album, which won her the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and spawned her first Top 10 single &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I&#x27;ve Always Heard It Should Be&quot; (No. 10), which earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Simon&#x27;s second album, &quot;Anticipation&quot;, followed later that year and became an even greater success; it spawned the successful singles &quot;Anticipation&quot; and &quot;Legend in Your Own Time&quot;, earned her another Grammy nomination, and became her first album to be certified Gold by the RIAA.

Simon achieved international fame with her third album, &quot;No Secrets&quot; (1972), which sat at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for five weeks and was certified Platinum. The album spawned the worldwide hit &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, which sat at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for three weeks, and earned Simon three Grammy nominations, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The second single &quot;The Right Thing to Do&quot;, as well as its B-side &quot;We Have No Secrets&quot;, were also successful. Her fourth album, &quot;Hotcakes&quot; (1974), soon followed and became an instant success; it reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, went Gold within two weeks of release, and spawned the hit singles &quot;Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Haven&#x27;t Got Time for the Pain&quot;. In 1975, Simon&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Playing Possum&quot;, and the compilation, &quot;The Best of Carly Simon&quot;, both appeared; the former hit the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and spawned the hit single &quot;Attitude Dancing&quot; (No. 21), and the latter eventually went 3× Platinum, becoming Simon&#x27;s best-selling release.

In 1977, Simon recorded &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; as the theme song to the Bond film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and it became a worldwide hit. The song garnered her another Grammy nomination, and was the No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit of 1977. Retrospectively, it has been ranked one of the greatest Bond themes.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard/jamesbondthemesongs.com&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Simon began recording more songs for films in the 1980s, including &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; for the film &quot;Heartburn&quot; (1986). The song became a major Adult Contemporary hit, and the &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; album appeared the following year, to further critical and commercial success. The album earned Simon two Grammy nominations, went Platinum, and spawned three more Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit singles: &quot;Give Me All Night&quot;, &quot;The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of&quot;, and &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;. With her 1988 hit &quot;Let the River Run&quot;, from the film &quot;Working Girl&quot;, Simon became the first artist to win a Grammy Award, an Academy Award, and a Golden Globe Award for a song composed and written, as well as performed, entirely by a single artist.

One of the most popular of the confessional singer/songwriters who emerged in the early 1970s, Simon has 24 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-charting singles and 28 &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary charting singles. Among her various accolades, she has won two Grammy Awards (from 14 nominations), and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; in 2004. AllMusic called her &quot;one of the quintessential singer-songwriters of the &#x27;70s&quot;. She has a contralto vocal range, and cited Odetta as a significant influence. Simon was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1994. She was honored with the Boston Music Awards Lifetime Achievement in 1995, and received a Berklee College of Music Honorary Doctor of Music Degree in 1998. In 2005, Simon was nominated for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but she has yet to claim her star. In 2012, she was honored with the Founders Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. In 2022, Simon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Simon was born on June 25, 1943, in New York City. Her father, Richard L. Simon, was the co-founder of Simon &amp; Schuster and a classical pianist who often played Chopin and Beethoven at home. Her mother, Andrea ( Heinemann), was a civil rights activist and singer. Her father was from a German-Jewish family, while her mother was Catholic. Her maternal grandfather, Friedrich Heinemann, was of German descent; her maternal grandmother, Ofelia Oliete, known as &quot;Chibie&quot;, was a Catholic originally from Cuba, and was of Pardo heritage, a freed-slave descendant. Ofelia was raised primarily in England by nuns until the age of 16. A 2017 episode of PBS show &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; tested Simon&#x27;s DNA, which included 10% African and 2% Native American, likely via her maternal grandmother.

Simon was raised in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, and had two elder sisters, Joanna and Lucy, and a younger brother, Peter, all of whom died of cancer, predeceasing her. They were raised as nominal Roman Catholics, according to a book of photography Peter published in the late 1990s. Simon has stated that when she was seven years old, a family friend in his teens sexually assaulted her. She stated, &quot;It was heinous&quot;, adding, &quot;It changed my view about sex for a long time.&quot;

Simon began stuttering severely when she was eight years old. A psychiatrist tried unsuccessfully to cure her stuttering. Instead, Simon turned to singing and songwriting. &quot;I felt so strangulated talking that I did the natural thing, which is to write songs, because I could sing without stammering, as all stammerers can.&quot; She has also spoken about growing up with dyslexia as well as her belief that the condition has positively influenced her songwriting, saying that her hit song &quot;Anticipation&quot; &quot;came down from the universe into my head and then out my mouth, so it bypassed the mind.&quot;

Simon attended Riverdale Country School and spent at least four semesters at Sarah Lawrence College. She also attended Juilliard School of Music.

==Career==
===1963–1969: The Simon Sisters and Elephant&#x27;s Memory===
Simon&#x27;s career began with a music group with her sister Lucy Simon as the Simon Sisters, with Lucy singing soprano and Carly contralto. Signed to Kapp Records, they made their television debut performing on &quot;Hootenanny&quot; on April 27, 1963. They released two albums for the label, the first being &quot;Meet the Simon Sisters&quot; (1964). The album produced a minor hit for the duo with the single &quot;Winkin&#x27;, Blinkin&#x27; and Nod&quot;, a children&#x27;s poem by Eugene Field that Lucy had put to music. Their second album, &quot;Cuddlebug&quot; (1966), soon followed. These albums were made available on CD in 2006 as &quot;Winkin&#x27;, Blinkin&#x27; and Nod: The Kapp Recordings&quot;, a remastered limited edition single-disc compilation. The duo made one more album together, 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Simon Sisters Sing the Lobster Quadrille and Other Songs for Children&quot; (which was released on CD in 2008 under the title &quot;Carly &amp; Lucy Simon Sing Songs for Children&quot;).

In the Peter Coan biography &quot;Taxi: The Harry Chapin Story&quot;, it had been suggested that Chapin, performing with his brothers, had briefly considered an idea of merging their act with the Simon Sisters, and performing under the new moniker &quot;The Brothers and Sisters&quot;. This idea was scrapped once Chapin and Simon&#x27;s careers as solo artists began to gain traction.

Simon collaborated with eclectic New York rockers Elephant&#x27;s Memory for about six months in the late &#x27;60s. Simon later said of her time with the band: &quot;I hated the gigs. We played clubs where everyone smoked dope and cigarettes at the same time. The sound systems were so dreadful I lost my voice easily and regularly, and after a summer I quit.&quot; In 1968, Simon met and befriended Jacob Brackman. Brackman would later become a frequent songwriting collaborator, with Simon describing him as her best friend: &quot;When I moved to my apartment on 35th St. (Murray Hill), Jake lived around the corner and we were inseparable, sharing our social lives. He introduced me to so many of the friends I still have.&quot;

===1970–1971: Going solo and mainstream success===
Simon was signed by Jac Holzman to Elektra Records in 1970. She released her self-titled debut album on February 9, 1971, and it peaked at No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album contained her breakthrough hit &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I&#x27;ve Always Heard It Should Be&quot;, which peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles (Hot 100) chart, and earned Simon a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards, where she also won Best New Artist. In his review of the album for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Timothy Crouse stated &quot;Carly&#x27;s voice perfectly matches her material&quot; and her &quot;...superbly controlled voice is complemented by deft arrangements.&quot;

Her second album, &quot;Anticipation&quot;, followed November 1971. Like its predecessor, the album peaked at No. 30 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and earned Simon a nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephen Davis gave a glowing review of the album, calling the title track &quot;a spirited examination of the tensions involved in a burgeoning romantic situation in which &quot;nobody has any idea&quot; of what&#x27;s going on or what&#x27;s going to happen.&quot; He also singled out &quot;Our First Day Together&quot; as &quot;a quiet song, lovely and quite enigmatic, with a trace of the minor chord influence of Joni Mitchell,&quot; as well as &quot;I&#x27;ve Got To Have You&quot;, which he described as &quot;an absolute clincher.&quot; On her experience of recording the album, Simon later said: &quot;It was one of the best memories I shall ever have of recording. I had a band. The entire album was just that band (Andy Newmark, Jimmy Ryan, Paul Glanz) and myself. Cat Stevens did some vocals and there were strings on a few songs, but on the whole, it was sparse, and I loved it.&quot;

The album&#x27;s lead single, also titled &quot;Anticipation&quot;, became a significant hit, reaching No. 3 at Easy Listening radio and No. 13 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Pop singles chart. It subsequently became notable in popular culture for its use in a variety of commercials to market the ketchup of the H. J. Heinz Company. The single was written in 15 minutes while Simon waited for Cat Stevens to pick her up for a date. The pair had become romantically involved shortly after Simon had opened for Stevens at L.A.&#x27;s Troubadour around the time her debut album was released. The next single release, &quot;Legend in Your Own Time&quot;, made a more modest impact on the Pop singles chart, peaking at No. 50. It was very successful on the Easy Listening chart, nearly cracking the top 10 at No. 11. The closing song, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got to Have You&quot; (written by Kris Kristofferson), was released as a single in Australia and reached the Top 10 on the Kent Music Report in 1972.

Also in 1971, Simon appeared as an auditioning singer in Miloš Forman film &quot;Taking Off&quot;, performing &quot;Long Term Physical Effects&quot;, which was also included on the soundtrack album for the film.

===1972–1974: &quot;No Secrets&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, and &quot;Hotcakes&quot;===

Simon scored the biggest success of her career in 1972–73 with &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;. The single hit No. 1 on the U.S. Pop and Adult Contemporary charts, sold over a million copies in the United States alone, and became one of the decade&#x27;s biggest hits. The song&#x27;s success propelled Simon&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;No Secrets&quot;, to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for five consecutive weeks. The album achieved Gold status that year, and by its 25th anniversary in 1997, it had been certified Platinum. &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; received nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female at the 16th Annual Grammy Awards, where &quot;No Secrets&quot; also earned a nomination for Best Engineered Recording. Additionally, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2004 and was listed at No. 72 in 2008 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s list of the top 100 songs from the chart&#x27;s first 50 years, August 1958 through July 2008. On August 23, 2014, the UK Official Charts Company gave it the accolade of &#x27;ultimate song of the 1970s&#x27;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it No. 495 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

The subject of &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; became one of the biggest mysteries in popular music, with the famous lyric &quot;You&#x27;re so vain/I bet you think this song is about you&quot;. For more than 40 years, Simon never publicly revealed the name of the subject. She hinted that it could be a composite of several people, with most press speculation considering Mick Jagger, who sings backup vocals on the recording, and Warren Beatty. Simon hinted the identity to a variety of talk shows and publications over the years, and, on August 5, 2003, auctioned off the information to the winner of a charity function for US$50,000, with the condition that the winner, television executive Dick Ebersol, not reveal it. Finally, in November 2015, Simon, promoting her about-to-be-published memoir, said, &quot;I have confirmed that the second verse is Warren&quot; and added that while &quot;Warren thinks the whole thing is about him&quot;, he is the subject only of that verse, with the remainder of the song referring to two other, still unnamed men.

The follow-up single, &quot;The Right Thing to Do&quot; (a love song directed to Simon&#x27;s then husband James Taylor), was another sizable hit later in 1973, reaching No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 17 on the Pop chart. The single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;We Have No Secrets&quot;, also became noteworthy; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Stephen Holden regarded the track as exemplifying the theme of &quot;No Secrets&quot;, which he saw as the &quot;difficulty of being happy,&quot; by &quot;painfully&quot; expressing &quot;the realization that emotion and rationalization are often irreconcilable.&quot; That same year, Simon performed on Lee Clayton&#x27;s self-titled album and co-sang on the song &quot;New York Suite 409&quot;. She also performed on brother-in-law Livingston Taylor&#x27;s album &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, and sang with both Livingston and his famous brother James on the songs &quot;Loving Be My New Horizon&quot; and &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.

In 1974, Simon followed the hugely successful &quot;No Secrets&quot; album with &quot;Hotcakes&quot;, which became an instant hit. It reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, remained on the chart for nearly eight months, and went Gold. &quot;Hotcakes&quot; included two top ten singles: &quot;Mockingbird&quot;, a duet with James Taylor that peaked at No. 5 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Pop Singles chart, and &quot;Haven&#x27;t Got Time for the Pain&quot;, which hit No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. The album was also well received critically; Jon Landau, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, stated &quot;&quot;Hotcakes&quot; is playful-sounding with some serious overtones — a balance that best suits [Simon] for the time being.&quot; He also singled out the tracks &quot;Think I&#x27;m Gonna Have a Baby&quot;, &quot;Forever My Love&quot;, and &quot;Haven&#x27;t Got Time for the Pain&quot; as &quot;substantial songs and performances, superior to almost everything else she has so far recorded.&quot; The same year, Simon provided vocals on Tom Rush&#x27;s album &quot;Ladies Love Outlaws&quot; and co-sang with Rush on &quot;No Regrets&quot; and as backup on &quot;Claim on Me&quot;.

===1975–1977: &quot;Playing Possum&quot;, &quot;Nobody Does it Better&quot;, and continued success===
Simon&#x27;s &quot;Playing Possum&quot; (1975) and &quot;Another Passenger&quot; (1976) continued her run of high-profile and generally well-received album releases. &quot;Playing Possum&quot; hit the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and garnered a successful Top 40 single with &quot;Attitude Dancing&quot;, as well as two other charting singles, but its racy album cover, which depicts Simon wearing only a black negligee and knee-high black boots, generated controversy. It was nominated for Best Album Package at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards. Shortly after the release of &quot;Playing Possom&quot;, Elektra released her first greatest hits album, &quot;The Best of Carly Simon&quot;. A major success, it went Gold within three weeks of release, and eventually became Simon&#x27;s all-time best-selling disc, reaching Triple-Platinum status in the United States by the mid-1990s. The album also went Gold in Canada and Quintuple-Platinum in Australia.

&quot;Another Passenger&quot; reached No. 29 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and produced only one charting single on the Pop singles chart, &quot;It Keeps You Runnin&#x27; (written by Michael McDonald of the Doobie Brothers), which peaked just outside the Top 40 at No. 46. The second single, &quot;Half a Chance&quot;, only charted on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at No. 39. Despite the lukewarm commercial reception, the album was, and remains one of Simon&#x27;s best reviewed works; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;Carly Simon&#x27;s best record&quot;, and it became a favorite among many of Simon&#x27;s fans. To promote the album, Simon made her only appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, on May 8, 1976. It was a pre-taped performance—a rare occurrence on that show—because she suffered terrible bouts of stage fright. In the appearance, she sang two songs: &quot;Half a Chance&quot; and her signature song, &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;. That same year saw Simon contributing backup vocals on the song &quot;Peter&quot; on Peter Ivers&#x27;s self-titled album.

In 1977, Simon had an international hit with the million-selling Gold single &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, the theme to the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. The song, her second-biggest U.S. hit after &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, was 1977&#x27;s biggest Adult Contemporary hit, where it held No. 1 for seven consecutive weeks. The single peaked one step behind Debby Boone&#x27;s hugely successful hit &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot; on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Singles chart from October 22 to November 5, 1977, and received nominations for Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female at the 20th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the third-greatest &quot;James Bond&quot; theme song, while &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it the second-greatest. In 2021, &quot;USA Today&quot; crowned it the greatest &quot;James Bond&quot; Theme Song. Also in 1977, Simon co-produced Libby Titus&#x27;s album &quot;Libby Titus&quot;, and sang backup on two songs: &quot;Can This Be Our Love Affair?&quot; and &quot;Darkness &#x27;Til Dawn&quot;, the later which comes from Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Another Passenger&quot;.

===1978–1979: &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot;, MUSE concerts, and departure from Elektra===
Simon&#x27;s career took another upward swing in 1978 with the Top 10 album &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot;. The album produced two Top 40 singles: the jazzy and sensual &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; (written with Michael McDonald), which hit the Top 10 on both the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts, and &quot;Devoted to You&quot;, a duet with James Taylor which hit No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot; was a major success, and returned Simon to Platinum album status in the U.S. &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; later earned Simon yet another nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female at the 21st Annual Grammy Awards, where the album also won Best Album Package. She was featured on the front covers of &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazines that year. Also in 1978, Simon and Taylor sang backing vocals on two songs for Taylor&#x27;s sister Kate&#x27;s album &quot;Kate Taylor&quot;: &quot;Happy Birthday Sweet Darling&quot; and &quot;Jason &amp; Ida&quot;. They sang backup on three songs on John Hall&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;John Hall&quot;: &quot;The Fault&quot;, &quot;Good Enough&quot;, and &quot;Voyagers&quot;. They also sing backup on one song, &quot;Power&quot;, from Hall&#x27;s next album, also titled &quot;Power&quot; (1979).

On November 2, 1978, Simon guested on the song &quot;I Live in the Woods&quot; at a live, four-hour concert by Burt Bacharach and the Houston Symphony Orchestra at Jones Hall in Houston, Texas. All the songs at that concert became Bacharach&#x27;s album &quot;Woman&quot;, which was released in 1979. That year, shortly after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, from September 19 to 22, a series of concerts were held at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden and sponsored by Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE), a group of musicians against nuclear power, co-founded by John Hall. Always politically active, Simon and James Taylor were part of the concerts which later became a documentary and concert film: &quot;No Nukes&quot; (1980), as well as a live album of the same name (1979).

In 1979, Simon released her eighth studio album: &quot;Spy&quot;. The album&#x27;s sales were a disappointment, peaking at only No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it was her last album for Elektra. A hard-edged single from the album, &quot;Vengeance&quot;, became a modest hit and received airplay on U.S. album rock stations, and peaked at No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles chart. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it has &quot;an urban rock feeling, with ominous guitar chording and touches of syndrums,&quot; saying that &quot;Simon&#x27;s vocals are...sharp and bold&quot; but &quot;less restrained than usual.&quot; &quot;Vengeance&quot; earned Simon a nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Female at the 21st Annual Grammy Awards—the first ceremony to feature the new category. Simon made a music video for the track, and she would later become the second female solo artist to be featured on MTV&#x27;s first day on the air in 1981 (Pat Benatar was the first female solo artist to appear on MTV, with &quot;You Better Run&quot;, and Juice Newton was the third, with &quot;Angel of the Morning&quot;).

&quot;Spy&quot; also features the songs &quot;Never Been Gone&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re So Close&quot;, which have become fan favorites and stand among Simon&#x27;s personal favorites of her own songs. Simon later called &quot;We&#x27;re So Close&quot; &quot;the saddest song I&#x27;ve ever written. It was about how close you can pretend to be when you know it&#x27;s all coming undone. How you can use excuses to make it all look okay.&quot; In their review of the album, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also singled out &quot;We&#x27;re So Close&quot;, calling the track &quot;the record&#x27;s gem.&quot; In 2009, Simon released &quot;Never Been Gone&quot;, an album which includes a newly recorded version of &quot;Never Been Gone&quot;, along with some of her other greatest hits.

===1980–1981: Move to Warner Bros, &quot;Come Upstairs&quot;, &quot;Jesse&quot;, and &quot;Torch&quot;===
In 1980, Simon signed with Elektra&#x27;s sibling label Warner Bros. Records and released her ninth studio album: &quot;Come Upstairs&quot;. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during a show to promote the album, Simon collapsed onstage from exhaustion; &quot;Fourteen shows were booked. I made it through eight and collapsed on stage. I had gotten very thin - only 114lbs. I canceled the rest of the shows,&quot; Simon later stated. She subsequently performed considerably less throughout the 1980s. From that album, Simon scored another million-selling U.S. Gold single with the hit &quot;Jesse&quot;, which peaked at No. 11 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop singles chart and remained on the chart for six months. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;the melody is simple yet powerful, the words are complex and Simon&#x27;s voice has never been better.&quot; Simon later said of the track: &quot;&#x27;Jesse&#x27; was a song laying plain the fact that good intentions go to hell when you are crazy for someone.&quot; AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann retrospectively called the track &quot;the album&#x27;s highlight&quot; and declared it &quot;Simon&#x27;s best-written pop/rock song since &#x27;You&#x27;re So Vain&#x27; and a Top Ten hit to boot.&quot; Ruhlmann additionally singled out the title track as &quot;frisky and seductive&quot; and referred to the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Take Me as I Am&quot;, as &quot;an upbeat raver.&quot;

Following the major commercial and critical success of &quot;Jesse&quot;, Simon&#x27;s singles became generally less successful in the mid-1980s, although most of them did well on Adult Contemporary radio formats. Simon also contributed the song &quot;Be With Me&quot; to the 1980 album &quot;In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record&quot;, which was produced by her sister Lucy and Lucy&#x27;s husband, David Levine. Simon can also be heard on the song &quot;In Harmony&quot;, along with other members of the Simon/Taylor families. Carly and Lucy contributed a Simon Sisters song—&quot;Maryanne&quot;—to the 1982 follow-up album &quot;In Harmony 2&quot;, which was also produced by Lucy and her husband. Both albums won the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children, in 1981 and 1983, respectively.

Simon&#x27;s 10th release, &quot;Torch&quot; (1981), was an album of melancholy jazz standards, recorded long before it became fashionable for rock artists to delve into the &quot;great American songbook&quot;. It peaked outside the Top 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (at No. 50), but remained on the charts for nearly six months and subsequently became one of her best-selling catalogue albums. The album was well-received critically; Stephen Holden, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called the album &quot;a gorgeous throwback&quot;, stating Simon&#x27;s &quot;magnificent alto, with its rough-and-tumble lows and wistful highs, has never sounded better.&quot; &quot;Torch&quot; also features one original song by Simon, &quot;From the Heart&quot;, as well as Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Not a Day Goes By&quot;, from his then-new musical &quot;Merrily We Roll Along&quot;.

===1982–1985: &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Hello Big Man&quot;, move to Epic, and commercial decline===
In 1982, Simon sang the Nile Rodgers &amp; Bernard Edwards-produced single &quot;Why&quot;, from the soundtrack album to the film &quot;Soup for One&quot;. It was a Top 10 hit in the U.K., and successful throughout Europe. Although &quot;Why&quot; stalled at No. 74 in the U.S., the song became a mellow classic in the aftermath of its being picked up to be covered and sampled by different artists from around 1989 onward. In 2015, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it No. 188 on their list of the 200 Best Songs of the 1980s. She had another UK success (No. 17) with the single &quot;Kissing with Confidence&quot;, a song from the 1983 album &quot;Dancing for Mental Health&quot; by Will Powers (a pseudonym for photographer Lynn Goldsmith). Simon was the uncredited singer of the song co-written and mixed by Todd Rundgren.

In 1983, Simon released her 11th album, &quot;Hello Big Man&quot;. Although it suffered from disappointing sales, the album received critical acclaim. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated &quot;Simon has returned to the sort of beautiful, folk-based singing and songwriting that originally made the world fall in love with her.&quot; Additionally, they singled out the title track and &quot;It Happens Everyday&quot; as &quot;two of the album&#x27;s best songs.&quot; The lead single, &quot;You Know What to Do&quot;, peaked at No. 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and No. 36 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Simon filmed a music video for the song at her home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, which received moderate airplay on MTV in the autumn of 1983. That same year, Simon performed on two albums: &quot;The Perfect Stranger&quot; by Jesse Colin Young (singing on the track &quot;Fight For It&quot; with Young) and &quot;Wonderland&quot; by Nils Lofgren (singing on the track &quot;Lonesome Ranger&quot; with Lofgren). In 1984, Simon made an uncredited cameo appearance in Ray Parker Jr.&#x27;s music video for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, the theme song from the film of the same name. By this time, her contract with Warner Bros. had ended.

In 1985, she signed with Epic Records and released her 12th album, &quot;Spoiled Girl&quot;. The album yielded two singles: &quot;Tired of Being Blonde&quot; and &quot;My New Boyfriend&quot;, with only the former charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (No. 71) and Adult Contemporary chart (No. 34). The album was met with mixed reviews and was a commercial disappointment, peaking only at No. 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and her contract with Epic was cancelled. The album became a cult favorite within Simon&#x27;s back catalogue. In July 2012, Hot Shot Records re-released the album as a deluxe edition with four bonus tracks. One of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;The Wives Are in Connecticut&quot;, caught the attention of Nora Ephron and Mike Nichols, who asked Simon to score their upcoming film &quot;Heartburn&quot;.

===1986–1989: Move to Arista, &quot;Coming Around Again&quot;, and career resurgence===
In 1986, Simon signed with Arista Records and soon rebounded from her career slump. Her first album for Arista, &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; (1987), gave Simon another international hit with the title track (which was written for and featured in the 1986 Mike Nichols film &quot;Heartburn&quot;), returning her to the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and the UK top 10. The album also featured the top 10 Adult Contemporary hits &quot;Give Me All Night&quot;, &quot;The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of&quot;, &quot;All I Want Is You&quot; (which featured Roberta Flack on backing vocals), and the standard &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; (featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica). Critical reception was also largely positive; &quot;People&quot; wrote &quot;Simon remains perhaps the most interesting of women pop singers. This album proves she is still captivating.&quot; Similarly, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the latest and one of the strongest chapters in a growing catalogue,&quot; it &quot;embodies everything that the 41-year-old singer-songwriter does best.&quot;

The album remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for over a year, became Simon&#x27;s first Gold release in nine years, and went Platinum in 1988. It garnered her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance that same year. In October 2017, Hot Shot Records released a two-disc 30th Anniversary deluxe edition of the album. These and older songs were featured in a picturesque HBO concert special titled &quot;Live from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard&quot;, where Simon and her band performed live on a specially built stage in the town of Gay Head in early June 1987. Most of these songs were compiled for her 1988 album, &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot;. Simon&#x27;s first live album; &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot; continued her mounting comeback, quickly going Gold, before later certified Platinum by the RIAA in 1996. From the album, a recording of Simon&#x27;s evergreen &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; was released as a single in the UK.

Throughout the 1980s, Simon successfully contributed to several film and television scores, including the songs:

*&quot;Why&quot; for the film &quot;Soup For One&quot; (1982).
*&quot;Something More&quot; for the film &quot;Love Child&quot; (1982).
*&quot;Someone Waits for You&quot; for the film &quot;Swing Shift&quot; (1984).
*&quot;All the Love in the World&quot; for the film &quot;Torchlight&quot; (1985).
*&quot;It&#x27;s Hard To Be Tender&quot; for the television miniseries &quot;Sins&quot; (1986).
*&quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t Love&quot; for the film &quot;Nothing in Common&quot; (1986).
*&quot;Two Looking at One&quot; for the film &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986).
*&quot;Coming Around Again&quot;/&quot;Itsy Bitsy Spider&quot; for the film &quot;Heartburn&quot; (1986).
*&quot;Let the River Run&quot; for the film &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Original Song (1988), the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (1988), and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media (1990).

After the success of &quot;Coming Around Again&quot;, Nichols asked Simon to score his next film, &quot;Working Girl&quot;. She spent the better part of 1988 scoring the film, and according to Simon, the studio threatened to replace &quot;Let the River Run&quot; with &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; by the Eagles. Nichols&#x27;s decision prevailed, and Simon became the first artist to win all three major awards (Oscar, Golden Globe and Grammy) for a song composed and written, as well as performed, entirely by a single artist (the only other such artist being Bruce Springsteen for &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;, from the 1993 film &quot;Philadelphia&quot;). Her musical work on the film also earned Simon her first BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Film Score in 1990. &quot;Let the River Run&quot; became a major hit, peaking at No. 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 11 on the Adult Contemporary chart. In 2004, AFI ranked the song at No. 91 on their list of the 100 greatest songs in American cinema. The &quot;Working Girl&quot; soundtrack album was released in August 1989, and featured more music from Simon. That same year, she released her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Amy the Dancing Bear&quot;.

As a tribute to Christa McAuliffe, who was slated to be the first teacher in space and who died in the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Simon wrote and recorded a song titled &quot;You&#x27;re Where I Go&quot;. McAuliffe was a Simon fan and had taken a cassette of her music on board the shuttle. In 1987, Simon co-wrote and recorded the title song to the Broadway play &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot;. The song was later released as the B-side to the single &quot;Give Me All Night&quot;, from the &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; album. That same year, Simon also sang the theme for the 1988 Democratic National Convention, &quot;The Turn of the Tide&quot;, for a Marlo Thomas television special &quot;Free to Be... a Family&quot;. The song was later included on the 1988 soundtrack album on A&amp;M Records.

===1990–1994: &quot;My Romance&quot;, &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately&quot;, and continued success===
In 1990, Simon released her second standards album, &quot;My Romance&quot;, and an album of original material, &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately&quot;. &quot;My Romance&quot; was quickly followed by another concert special for HBO, titled &quot;Carly in Concert: My Romance&quot; and featuring Harry Connick, Jr. &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately&quot; features a title track that was supposed to have been the main theme for the Mike Nichols film &quot;Postcards from the Edge&quot;; the entire title sequence – including the song – was deleted by producers, although a great deal of Simon&#x27;s underscore compositions and thematic interludes remain in the film, eventually earning Simon her second BAFTA Award nomination for Best Original Film Score in 1991. The album was a critical and commercial success, spending eight months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while Stephen Holden, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called the album &quot;superb&quot; and the title track &quot;the album&#x27;s most stunning moment.&quot; The album also features the major (No. 4) Adult Contemporary chart hit &quot;Better Not Tell Her&quot;, which remained on the chart for 21 weeks, becoming Simon&#x27;s biggest hit of the 1990s. A second single, &quot;Holding Me Tonight&quot;, was also a successful Adult Contemporary chart hit, peaking at No. 36. That same year, Simon published her second children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Boy of the Bells&quot;.

In 1991, she wrote her third children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Song&quot;, which was based on the song of the same name from her 1990 album &quot;Have You Seen Me Lately&quot;. That same year, Simon performed a duet with Plácido Domingo on the song &quot;The Last Night of the World&quot; (from the stage musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;) on Domingo&#x27;s album &quot;The Broadway I Love&quot;. In 1992, Simon wrote the music for the Nora Ephron film &quot;This Is My Life&quot;, and the soundtrack album was released shortly thereafter. It includes the song &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, a No. 16 Adult Contemporary hit. In 1993, she contributed her performance of &quot;In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning&quot;, from her 1990 album &quot;My Romance&quot;, to the Nora Ephron film &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;. It was also included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. Simon recorded the same song in combination with &quot;Guess I&#x27;ll Hang My Tears Out to Dry&quot; with Frank Sinatra for his album &quot;Duets&quot; (1993). By this point, Sinatra&#x27;s health was too poor for him to record, so the feat was accomplished by producers lifting an isolated prerecorded vocal track from an earlier performance and laying a new background – and Simon – behind it. The album later earned a nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance at the 37th Annual Grammy Awards.

In 1993, Simon was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera Association and the Kennedy Center to record a contemporary opera that would appeal to younger people. The result was &quot;Romulus Hunt&quot; (named after its 12-year-old protagonist), released in November of that year. In December 2014, the Nashville Opera Association premiered a new performance edition of the opera. Also in 1993, Simon published her fourth children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Nighttime Chauffeur&quot;, and contributed to Swiss musician Andreas Vollenweider&#x27;s album &quot;Eolian Minstrel&quot;; she co-wrote the song &quot;Private Fires&quot; with Vollenweider, and was featured vocalist on the song. Simon wrote and performed the theme song, titled &quot;The Promise and the Prize&quot;, for the short-lived sitcom &quot;Phenom&quot; (1993–1994).

In 1994, she covered the song &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; for Ken Burns&#x27; film &quot;Baseball&quot;, as well as a recording of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Crush on You&quot; for Larry Adler&#x27;s tribute album &quot;The Glory of Gershwin&quot;. That same year, Simon recorded and released her 16th album, &quot;Letters Never Sent&quot;. The album originated from Simon finding an old box of letters that she&#x27;d written, but never mailed, and she set a handful of them to music. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated &quot;The results are funky, fascinating, and sumptuous. A daring move that pays off.&quot; From the album, Simon wrote &quot;Like A River&quot; in honor of her mother, Andrea Simon, and &quot;Touched by the Sun&quot; for her dear friend, Jackie Onassis, both of whom died from cancer in 1994. The song &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot;, originally written for the 1992 Nora Ephron film &quot;This Is My Life&quot; and featured on the soundtrack album, was also featured in Ephron&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;, as well as its soundtrack album. That same year, Simon released &quot;Bells, Bears and Fishermen&quot;, a spoken word recording of her first three children&#x27;s books: &quot;Amy the Dancing Bear&quot;, &quot;The Boy of the Bells&quot;, and &quot;The Fisherman&#x27;s Song&quot;, complete with sound effects and original music.

===1995–1999: Grand Central concert, &quot;Film Noir&quot;, and breast cancer===
In April 1995, Simon surprised thousands of commuters at New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal with an unannounced performance that was filmed for a Lifetime television special, titled &quot;Live at Grand Central&quot;. It was also released on home video in December of that year. It was re-released on Blu-ray, Vinyl and CD on January 27, 2023. Simon also featured in an episode of the Lifetime original series &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot;, which was broadcast the same night. Also in 1995, she performed on an American concert tour in conjunction with Hall &amp; Oates. On August 30, 1995, Simon made a rare joint appearance with her ex-husband, James Taylor, for a concert on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. Dubbed &quot;Livestock &#x27;95&quot;, it was a benefit for the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Agricultural Society, with over 10,000 people in attendance. Simon performed a duet with Mindy Jostyn on the song &quot;Time, Be on My Side&quot;, which featured on Jostyn&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Five Miles from Hope&quot; about her recent battle with colon cancer. Ten years later, Jostyn died from the disease at the age of 43. On November 7, 1995, Simon released the three-disc boxed set &quot;Clouds in My Coffee&quot;. A full career retrospective at the time of its release, the box set features 58 songs spanning Simon&#x27;s career from 1965 to 1995. Nine tracks were previously unreleased on any of Simon&#x27;s albums, and the booklet includes numerous photographs and extensive liner notes by Simon. That same year, Simon and her sister Lucy sang on the track &quot;The Great Mandala (The Wheel of Life)&quot; from Peter, Paul and Mary&#x27;s album &quot;LifeLines&quot;.

In November 1995, the American press reported an incident between Simon and the Pretenders&#x27; vocalist Chrissie Hynde at a Joni Mitchell concert at New York&#x27;s Fez Club. Some reports stated that a drunk and disorderly Hynde grabbed Simon around the neck and punched her, although Simon attempted to put these rumors to rest on her official website in 2002, writing &quot;Chrissie was a bit intoxicated and was yelling out during Joni&#x27;s performance which needless to say, everybody wanted to hear. Chrissie was sitting right next to me and I asked her to be a little quieter. She started choking me in a loving way, saying: &#x27;you&#x27;re great too Carly, get up there, you need to do this too&#x27;. That&#x27;s all it was about. I must say that her choking me in &#x27;fun intoxication&#x27; looked to a lot of the audience like a fight. It was not. I just couldn&#x27;t believe that no one was interceding and saying anything to her. I love her music and respect her as an artist. It was just one of those things. Go figure.&quot;

Simon continued to write and record music for films, and wrote the theme songs to several more movies; these included &quot;Two Little Sisters&quot; from the drama film &quot;Marvin&#x27;s Room&quot; (1996), and &quot;In Two Straight Lines&quot; from the family comedy &quot;Madeline&quot; (1998). She released her fifth children&#x27;s book, &quot;Midnight Farm&quot;, on August 1, 1997. Simon&#x27;s third standards album, &quot;Film Noir&quot;, was released on September 16, 1997. Recorded in collaboration with Jimmy Webb (who duets with Simon on the track &quot;Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year&quot;), the album was nominated for the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance the following year. John Travolta duets with Simon on the track &quot;Two Sleepy People&quot;, and Martin Scorsese penned the liner notes featured in the album&#x27;s booklet. &quot;Songs in Shadow: The Making of Carly Simon&#x27;s Film Noir&quot; aired as a special presentation on AMC. This documentary also features footage of Webb, Arif Mardin and Van Dyke Parks in the studio recording the album with Simon.

Simon was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 1997, and underwent surgery, as well as chemotherapy; &quot;I was in the hospital for one night,&quot; Simon said, &quot;Because they got everything during the procedure, and the prognosis was good, my doctor gave me the option of whether to have chemo. I decided to play it safe.&quot; The following year, the single-disc UK import &quot;The Very Best of Carly Simon: Nobody Does It Better&quot; was released, and became a UK Albums Chart hit, peaking at No. 22. In 1999, Simon worked again with Andreas Vollenweider, and was the featured vocalist for the song &quot;Your Silver Key&quot; on Vollenweider&#x27;s album &quot;Cosmopoly&quot;. That same year, Simon and her daughter Sally Taylor contributed the track &quot;Amity&quot; to the soundtrack album of the film &quot;Anywhere but Here&quot;.

===2000–2002: &quot;The Bedroom Tapes&quot;, departure from Arista, and Christmas album===
On May 16, 2000, Simon released her 18th studio album, &quot;The Bedroom Tapes&quot;. Largely written and recorded at home in her bedroom while she was recuperating from her health problems of the previous couple of years, it was Simon&#x27;s first album of original songs since &quot;Letters Never Sent&quot;, nearly six years earlier. &quot;The Bedroom Tapes&quot; peaked at only No. 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, but received widespread critical acclaim. AllMusic wrote that Simon was &quot;as raw as she was on 1975&#x27;s &quot;Playing Possum&quot;, and just as sweet as 1987&#x27;s &quot;Coming Around Again&quot;, but Simon is fresh. Although in her mid-fifties, she is still a charmer.&quot; Writing for &quot;Billboard&quot;, Steve Baltin called the album &quot;A feast for fans of intelligent, richly crafted pop music&quot;, while &quot;People&quot; wrote that the album &quot;unfolds like a one-woman show&quot;, calling it a &quot;Boffo performance.&quot; The opening track, &quot;Our Affair&quot;, was remixed by Richard Perry and featured on the soundtrack album of the 2000 film &quot;Bounce&quot;, starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck.

In 2001, Simon performed on &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; with Janet Jackson on Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;All for You&quot;. According to Jackson, she phoned Simon to ask for permission to use samples of &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, but Simon wanted to re-record her vocals. She agreed, with Simon wanting to write new lines. Jackson&#x27;s producer Jimmy Jam sent her the tracks they were already working on, and she went into a studio on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard to record some material. She rapped, initially thinking that Jackson and the producers would not use it, but they decided to marry both tracks, as the singers thought it &quot;worked perfectly&quot;, and it became a duet. Simon expressed that Jackson &quot;could not have been sweeter or more appreciative.&quot; The song was released as a single and peaked at No. 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Simon also contributed backup vocals on two songs, &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Away&quot; and &quot;East of Eden&quot;, for Mindy Jostyn&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Blue Stories&quot;. In November 2001, Simon&#x27;s Oscar-winning song &quot;Let the River Run&quot; was used in a public service ad for the United States Postal Service. Titled &quot;Pride&quot;, it was produced to boost public confidence and postal worker morale in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks.

In January 2002, Simon recorded a Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Is Almost Here&quot;, while she was in Los Angeles to lend support to her son Ben Taylor and his band. It was released by Rhino Records that October. That same year, Simon personally chose all of the songs for a new two-disc anthology album, simply titled &quot;Anthology&quot;. This release represented every one of her studio albums (up until that point) with at least one song, digitally remastered, and also released on Rhino Records. The following year saw a re-release of her Christmas album with two extra tracks: &quot;White Christmas&quot; (with Burt Bacharach) and &quot;Forgive&quot; (with Andreas Vollenweider). These two tracks were also released together as a CD single. She also performed two concerts during the 2004 holiday season at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater, along with BeBe Winans, Rob Thomas, son Ben and daughter Sally, Livingston Taylor, Mindy Jostyn and Kate Taylor, along with other members of the Taylor and Simon family.

===2003–2007: &quot;Reflections&quot;, move to Columbia, and commercial resurgence===
Simon wrote and recorded songs for the Disney Winnie the Pooh films &quot;Piglet&#x27;s Big Movie&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Pooh&#x27;s Heffalump Movie&quot; in 2005, as well as the direct-to-video &quot;A Very Merry Pooh Year&quot; in 2002. Several of her songs were also featured in the 2004 film &quot;Little Black Book&quot;, which starred Brittany Murphy and Holly Hunter, with Simon appearing as herself in a cameo role at the end of the film. In the spring of 2004, Simon released her fourth greatest hits album: &quot;&quot;. The album was a great critical and commercial success, peaking at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and remaining on the chart for 19 weeks. On March 2, 2007, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA. An international version of the album was also released; it hit No. 25 on the UK charts and went Gold there as well. Also in 2004, Simon performed a duet version of &quot;The Right Thing to Do&quot; with Megan Mullally for the TV soundtrack &quot;Will &amp; Grace: Let the Music Out!&quot;.

In the summer of 2005, Simon released her fourth album of standards, &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;, on Columbia Records. A critical and commercial success, it reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (her first Top 10 album on this chart since &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot; in 1978), and she was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album the following year. To promote &quot;Moonlight Serenade&quot;, Simon performed two concerts on board the &quot;RMS Queen Mary 2&quot; that September, which were recorded and released on DVD as &quot;A Moonlight Serenade on the Queen Mary 2&quot; on November 22, 2005. Accompanied by her children, Sally and Ben, Simon embarked on a concert tour across the United States—her first tour in 10 years, titled &quot;The Serenade Tour&quot;. She also sang a duet, &quot;Angel of the Darkest Night&quot;, with Mindy Jostyn on Jostyn&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Coming Home&quot;. The album was released several months after Jostyn&#x27;s death on March 10, 2005. One of Simon&#x27;s closest friends, Jostyn was married to Jacob Brackman, Simon&#x27;s long-time friend and musical collaborator. In 2005, Simon became involved in the legal defense of musician and family friend John Forté with his struggle against a federal incarceration.

Simon again teamed up with Andreas Vollenweider for his 2006 holiday album, &quot;Midnight Clear&quot;, performing vocals on four tracks: &quot;Midnight Clear&quot;, &quot;Suspended Note&quot;, &quot;Hymn to the Secret Heart&quot;, and &quot;Forgive&quot; (which was a song Simon wrote for the 2003 re-release of her own holiday album &quot;Christmas Is Almost Here&quot;). Also in 2006, Simon performed with Livingston Taylor on his album &quot;There You Are Again&quot;, singing on the opening track &quot;Best of Friends&quot;, which became a Top 40 Adult Contemporary hit.

In 2007, Simon released her fifth album of covers, a collection of &quot;soothing songs and lullabies&quot; called &quot;Into White&quot;. The collection featured covers of songs by Cat Stevens, the Beatles, Judy Garland, and the Everly Brothers, as well as two new original songs, &quot;Quiet Evening&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Just Remember You&quot;, and a re-recording of Simon&#x27;s own &quot;Love of My Life&quot;. The album also features vocal collaborations with her children; Ben and Sally, who perform a trio with Simon on the track &quot;You Can Close Your Eyes&quot;, which author Sheila Weller described in her 2008 book &quot;Girls Like Us&quot; as &quot;slow, spectral&quot; and &quot;achingly beautiful.&quot; &quot;People&quot; also praised the track, describing it as &quot;dreamy&quot;, and calling it &quot;the best moment on the album.&quot; &quot;Into White&quot; continued Simon&#x27;s recently rejuvenated high chart profile, and became &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Shot Debut, entering the chart at No. 15, peaking at No. 13 the following week, and remaining on the chart for 10 weeks.

===2008–2011: &quot;This Kind of Love&quot; and &quot;Never Been Gone&quot;===
In March 2008, it was announced that Simon had signed with the Starbucks label, Hear Music. She released a new album titled &quot;This Kind of Love&quot; with them in the spring of 2008. The album was her first collection of all original songs since 2000&#x27;s &quot;The Bedroom Tapes&quot;, and it became another commercial and critical success for Simon, reaching No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and selling nearly 150,000 copies by 2009. On June 19, 2008, Simon and her son Ben performed &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; together on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on Sirius Satellite radio. On October 13, 2009, it was reported that Simon was suing Starbucks, saying they did not adequately promote &quot;This Kind of Love&quot;. Simon&#x27;s lawsuit stated that Starbucks publicly announced it was backing out of participation in Hear Music just days before the album came out—a decision that she claimed doomed the record before it was even released.

On October 27, 2009, Simon released her 23rd album, &quot;Never Been Gone&quot;, on Iris Records. An album of acoustic reworkings of some of her greatest hits and classic songs, it also features two new songs: &quot;No Freedom&quot; and &quot;Songbird&quot;. On November 26, 2009, Simon appeared on the Care Bears float of the 83rd Annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, where she performed an acoustic version of her hit &quot;Let the River Run&quot;.

On March 2, 2010, BBC Radio 2 broadcast &quot;An Evening With Carly Simon&quot;, where she performed live for the first time in the UK with her son Ben Taylor to a small audience of approximately 100 people. This coincided with the UK release of Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Never Been Gone&quot;, which was released for the Mother&#x27;s Day season and peaked at No. 45, becoming her first studio album to reach the UK Albums Chart Top 100 since 1987&#x27;s &quot;Coming Around Again&quot;. Simon also appeared on various UK television shows to promote the album, including &quot;The One Show&quot; and &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;. That same year, Simon contributed the track &quot;Calls a Soft Voice&quot; to Arif Mardin&#x27;s album &quot;All My Friends Are Here&quot;.

===2012–2019: ASCAP Founders Award, collaborations, and memoirs===
On April 18, 2012, Simon was honored with the Founders Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. She performed &quot;Anticipation&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; at the ceremony. Bill Withers presented Simon with her award and honored her with a speech, and Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines performed Simon&#x27;s 1971 hit &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I&#x27;ve Always Heard It Should Be&quot;. That same year, Simon contributed the track &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; to the Bob Dylan tribute album &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;. Proceeds from the album were donated to the human rights organization Amnesty International.

On July 27, 2013, in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Simon performed &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; with Taylor Swift on her Red Tour. Swift had previously cited Simon as a musical influence and &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; as one of her favorite songs. Later that year, Simon dueted with Jimmy Webb on the track &quot;Easy for You to Say&quot; from his album &quot;Still Within the Sound of My Voice&quot;. On October 30, 2013, Simon performed alongside Natasha Bedingfield at the Oceana Partners Award Gala in Los Angeles.

On November 24, 2015, Simon published &quot;Boys in the Trees: A Memoir&quot;, an autobiographical book focusing on her childhood and her early life, from age five until the year 1983. The book was met with widespread critical acclaim, and &quot;Billboard&quot; later ranked it No. 50 on their list of the 100 Greatest Music Books of All Time. The two-disc compilation album &quot;Songs from the Trees (A Musical Memoir Collection)&quot; was simultaneously released along with the book. The album features songs written and/or recorded during the era the book covers, as well as two previously unreleased songs: &quot;Showdown&quot; (originally recorded during the sessions for Simon&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot;) and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Thank You Enough&quot;, a brand new song written and performed with her son Ben Taylor.

On February 14, 2016, Simon made a surprise appearance at Clive Davis&#x27;s Pre-Grammy Party and performed &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;, which drew a &quot;thunderous standing ovation&quot;, and appeared in Davis&#x27; Grammy Party Class Photo. Later that year, Simon confirmed during a book signing that she and her son Ben Taylor were working to release EDM remixes of her signature songs. She also said she wanted to record an album with her two children.

In April 2017, Simon featured on the deluxe edition of the Gorillaz album &quot;Humanz&quot;, on the track &quot;Ticker Tape&quot;. That same year, BBC Four broadcast the documentary &quot;Carly Simon: No Secrets&quot; as part of their Classic Albums series. It details the making of the album &quot;No Secrets&quot;, and includes interviews with Simon, producer Richard Perry, and many of the main musicians and production staff. The following year, Simon came to terms with the Universal Music Publishing Group to administer her song portfolio.

On October 22, 2019, Simon released a second memoir titled &quot;Touched by the Sun: My Friendship with Jackie&quot;, which recounts her friendship with former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. As a tie-in to its release, Simon also released a newly mixed live version of &quot;Touched by the Sun&quot; from her 1995 concert special &quot;Live at Grand Central&quot; as a single. The book was selected by &quot;People&quot; as one of the top 10 books of 2019.

===2020–present: Carnegie Hall tribute and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction===
On November 27, 2019, it was announced that Simon would be honored at Carnegie Hall with a tribute concert, titled &quot;The Music of Carly Simon&quot;, on March 19, 2020. On March 12, 2020, it was announced the concert had been postponed until fall due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was later rescheduled to take place on March 23, 2022, before being cancelled altogether due to COVID-19–related challenges.

On February 2, 2022, Simon was announced as one of the 17 performers nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2022. On May 4, 2022, Simon was announced as one of the seven artists in the performer category being inducted. In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Simon stated &quot;There&#x27;s that first thought of, &#x27;I don&#x27;t believe it. It must be the House of Pancakes I just got into.&#x27; Truly, I was dumbfounded. I thought they must be mistaken.&quot; Simon evenly jokingly theorized that the reason for being shut out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame despite being eligible for 26 years prior was due to a her cameo scene in the 1985 film &quot;Perfect&quot; where she had to throw a drink at star John Travolta&#x27;s face in a restaurant with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; publisher (and Hall of Fame co-founder/former Hall chairman) Jann Wenner, who also had cameo in the same scene; looking on, to which described their friendship as being &quot;awkward&quot; afterwards. When asked about the possibility of performing at the ceremony, Simon stated &quot;I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not going to put myself onstage and scare the hell out of myself.&quot; Simon said she&#x27;d like Cat Stevens or Robbie Robertson to induct her: &quot;Those are the two people who were instrumental in my first solo light.&quot;

On November 5, 2022, Simon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She was unable to attend the ceremony due to personal tragedy. Sara Bareilles, who inducted Simon, read a note from her stating: &quot;I am humbled, shocked, proud, over-achieved, under-qualified and singularly grateful to everyone without whom I really couldn&#x27;t be here.&quot; Bareilles then performed &quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot;, followed by Olivia Rodrigo, who performed &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot;.

It was announced on July 12, 2023, that the compilation album &quot;These Are the Good Old Days: The Carly Simon and Jac Holzman Story&quot; would be released on CD and Vinyl on September 15, 2023. The collection features a mix of hits and deep cuts selected from Simon&#x27;s first three albums, chosen and sequenced by Holzman.

==Personal life==
In the 1960s, Simon was briefly engaged to British writer William Donaldson. Donaldson described her as &quot;the answer to any sane man&#x27;s prayers; funny, quick, erotic, extravagantly talented.&quot;

Simon married fellow singer-songwriter James Taylor on November 3, 1972 in New York City, where they lived at the time. They have two children, Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Maria Taylor (born January 7, 1974) and Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Simon Taylor (born January 22, 1977), both of whom are musicians and political activists. Simon and Taylor divorced in 1983. In June 2004, Simon said that she no longer speaks to her ex-husband. &quot;I would say our relationship is non-existent. It&#x27;s not the way I want it.&quot; In 2015, following the publication of her memoir &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot;, Simon reiterated in an interview that she and Taylor had not spoken in decades, saying, &quot;I still want to heal him, I still want to make him all right. And I love him so much.&quot; From 1972 to 1979, Simon sang backup vocals on the following James Taylor songs and studio albums: &quot;One Man Parade&quot; from &quot;One Man Dog&quot; (1972). &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Is Music Now&quot;, &quot;Let It All Fall Down&quot;, &quot;Me and My Guitar&quot;, &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Baby&quot;, and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Song&quot; from &quot;Walking Man&quot; (1974). &quot;How Sweet It Is&quot; from &quot;Gorilla&quot; (1975). &quot;Shower the People&quot;, &quot;A Junkie&#x27;s Lament&quot;, &quot;Slow Burning Love&quot;, and &quot;Family Man&quot; from &quot;In the Pocket&quot; (1976). &quot;Terra Nova&quot; (which she co-wrote with Taylor) from &quot;JT&quot; (1977). &quot;B.S.U.R.&quot; from &quot;Flag&quot; (1979).

She was engaged to musician Russ Kunkel, from 1985 to 1986. The pair became romantically involved during the making of Simon&#x27;s album &quot;Spoiled Girl&quot;.

Simon married James Hart, a writer, poet and businessman, on December 23, 1987. The couple divorced in 2007.

Simon underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy, and reconstructive surgery for breast cancer between 1997 and 1998. There had been a lump in her breast for several years, but her doctors had advised against surgery. Simon later recounted: &quot;Then one doctor said, &#x27;You know what, I&#x27;d rather see it in a jar than in your breast. She also said that she felt &quot;a little angry with [herself]&quot; that she did not insist on taking it out sooner. Simon&#x27;s surgery came at the same time as the death of her long-time friend Linda McCartney, who had also battled breast cancer. Simon described McCartney&#x27;s death as having emotionally &quot;crushed&quot; her. Furthermore, Simon has had osteopenia since at least the age of 61, which has resulted in her avoidance of high-heeled shoes in order to escape discomfort.

Simon has been close friends with James Taylor&#x27;s younger brother Livingston Taylor for over 40 years. Livingston said, &quot;I love Carly and Carly loves me. She&#x27;s a ferocious advocate and supporter of my music.&quot; They have worked as a musical duo for some songs such as &quot;Best of Friends&quot;, released in Livingston&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;There You Are Again&quot;, and others earlier in their careers.

In May 2010, Simon revealed she had been one of the several celebrities who fell victim to financial advisor Kenneth I. Starr, whose Ponzi scheme lured her into &quot;investing&quot; millions of dollars with him, which she lost.

In 2008, Simon was reportedly dating Richard Koehler, a surgeon specializing in minimally invasive laparoscopy. The pair were reported to have been dating as early as 2006. In 2015, the two were reportedly living together on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

In October 2016, Simon donated the rights to &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; for use in an anti-Donald Trump political attack ad. Simon had long chosen to keep her political views private and had never allowed &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; to be used for political purposes in the past. As a reason for changing that, Simon cited the recently released &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape, in which Trump can be heard bragging on a hot mic about his behavior towards married women that commentators and lawyers have described as sexual assault. Simultaneously, Simon announced her opposition to Trump&#x27;s candidacy in the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election. Simon cited the tape as what motivated her for the first time in her career to publicly take a political stance.

In October 2022, Simon lost both of her sisters to cancer within a day of each other. Joanna Simon died on October 19, 2022, from thyroid cancer and Lucy Simon died the next day on October 20, 2022, from metastatic breast cancer. Joanna Simon was 85 years old and Lucy Simon was 82 years old. Her brother, Peter Simon, had previously died from lung cancer on November 18, 2018. Peter Simon was 71 years old.

===Covers and tributes===
Simon&#x27;s songs have been widely covered by other musicians; the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame wrote that her &quot;influence on fellow artists is incalculable.&quot; Notable among the many artists covering &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; is Marilyn Manson&#x27;s unusual version featuring Johnny Depp on guitar. Taylor Swift brought Simon onstage to share &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; as a duet at the Foxborough date during Swift&#x27;s Red Tour in 2013. Swift had previously called the track &quot;the best song that&#x27;s ever been written.&quot; In May 2021, Dave Grohl stated that the song &quot;still amazes&quot; him; his band Foo Fighters previously covered the song at the &quot;Grammy Nominations Concert Live!!&quot; in 2008.

&quot;Nobody Does It Better&quot; has been performed live by Celine Dion and Radiohead; indeed, Radiohead&#x27;s lead singer, Thom Yorke, called it the &quot;sexiest song ever written.&quot; Tori Amos said that Simon&#x27;s song &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot; (the title track of &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot;) inspired her own songwriting efforts, and Amos has performed the song in concert.

===In popular culture===
Simon is one of the various artists mentioned in the 1974 Reunion song &quot;Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)&quot;. Groovie Ghoulies recorded a song simply titled &quot;Carly Simon&quot;, which was released on their 1999 album &quot;Fun in the Dark&quot;.

Simon appeared as herself in the films &quot;Perfect&quot; (1985) and &quot;Little Black Book&quot; (2004). On television, she appeared as herself in a 1989 episode of &quot;thirtysomething&quot;, titled &quot;Success&quot;. In 1995, she made a voice cameo as a caller named Marie on a season two episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, titled &quot;Roz in the Doghouse&quot;. In 2013, she appeared as herself in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Total Recall&quot;.

The fifth-season premiere episode of &quot;Bob&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, &quot;Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl&quot;, involves Gene Belcher and his sometime friend Courtney Wheeler staging separate, and then ultimately unified, stage reenactments of the movies &quot;Die Hard&quot; and &quot;Working Girl&quot;, with Courtney&#x27;s father Doug promising to enlist Carly Simon to appear at his daughter&#x27;s performance. Simon provides an uncredited voice cameo at the end, singing the ersatz theme song to the children&#x27;s combined musical.

===Influence on other artists===
Taylor Swift said of Simon: &quot;She has always been known for her songwriting and her honesty. She&#x27;s known as an emotional person but a strong person. I really, really look up to that. I admire her. I think she&#x27;s always been beautiful and natural and seems to do it all effortlessly. There&#x27;s nothing more attractive than someone who seems to live effortlessly.&quot; Carly Rae Jepsen was also influenced by Simon, stating: &quot;In truth I think I&#x27;m inspired by her for many reasons,&quot; she explained. &quot;I think her music is amazing. I love the way she writes, which is very – almost to the point. There&#x27;s not a lot of – I want to say there&#x27;s not a lot of metaphor to it. I think it&#x27;s really relatable and honest. And I love her fashion sense.&quot; Brittany Murphy considered Simon her idol, once stating: &quot;I have always been acquainted with Carly&#x27;s catalogue, to say the least. She&#x27;s the most tremendous woman. She&#x27;s a force of nature. She&#x27;s just a delight.&quot;

Tori Amos cited Simon as an influence, and often covers &quot;Boys in the Trees&quot; in concert; &quot;I used to listen to this song over and over, wishing I&#x27;d wrote it,&quot; Amos once said of the track. At the 2012 ASCAP awards, where Simon received the Founders Award, Dixie Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines stated: &quot;I grew up listening to Carly Simon, she was a huge influence on me.&quot; Maines then performed &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I&#x27;ve Always Heard It Should Be&quot;, which she said was one of her favorite Carly Simon songs. In a 2021 essay for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Clairo wrote of Simon: &quot;Every time I listen to her, I feel like she&#x27;s talking to me directly or saying something that took a lot of courage to build up to say.&quot; She continued: &quot;There&#x27;s nothing you could add or take away from her legacy, because she&#x27;s always been truthful,&quot; concluding with &quot;the fact that she was always so upfront about everything that wasn&#x27;t perfect, I think, is what makes her the most important to me.&quot; Sara Bareilles, while inducting Simon into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, stated: &quot;Like so many singer-songwriters who have come after her, I too have felt the powerful impact of Carly Simon and been made better for it.&quot;

<text>Newark-on-Trent () or Newark is a market town and civil parish in the Newark and Sherwood district in Nottinghamshire, England. It is on the River Trent, and was historically a major inland port. The A1 road bypasses the town on the line of the ancient Great North Road. The town&#x27;s origins are likely to be Roman, as it lies on a major Roman road, the Fosse Way. It grew up around Newark Castle, St Mary Magdalene church and later developed as a centre for the wool and cloth trades.

In the English Civil War, it was besieged by Parliamentary forces and relieved by Royalist forces under Prince Rupert. Newark has a marketplace lined with many historical buildings and one of its most notable landmarks is St Mary Magdalene church with its towering spire at high and the highest structure in the town. The church is the tallest church building in Nottinghamshire and can be seen when entering Newark or bypassing it. The population of the town was recorded at 30,345 at the 2021 census.

The place-name Newark is first attested in the cartulary of Eynsham Abbey in Oxfordshire, where it appears as &quot;Newercha&quot; in about 1054–1057 and &quot;Niweweorche&quot; in about 1075–1092. It appears as &quot;Newerche&quot; in the 1086 Domesday Book. The name &quot;New werk&quot; has the apparent meaning of &quot;New fort&quot;.

The origins of the town are possibly Roman, from its position on an important Roman road, the Fosse Way. In a document which purports to be a charter of 664 AD, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the Abbey of Peterborough by King Wulfhere of Mercia. An Anglo-Saxon pagan cemetery used from the early fifth to early seventh centuries has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.

In the reign of Edward the Confessor, Newark belonged to Godiva and her husband Leofric, Earl of Mercia, who granted it to Stow Minster in 1055. After the Norman Conquest, Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop Remigius de Fécamp, after whose death control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of Edward VI. There were burgesses in Newark at the time of the Domesday survey. The reign of Edward III shows evidence that it had long been a borough by prescription. The Newark wapentake (hundred) in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of Anglo-Saxon rule (10th–11th centuries).

===Medieval to Stuart period===
Newark Castle was originally a fortified manor house founded by the Anglo-Saxon King Edward the Elder. In 1073, Remigius de Fécamp, Bishop of Lincoln, put up an earthwork motte-and-bailey fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from Henry I, as was St Leonard&#x27;s Hospital. The bishopric also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King Stephen to establish a mint. King John died of dysentery in Newark Castle in 1216.

The town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade – by the time of Henry II a major market was held there. Wednesday and Saturday markets in the town were founded in the period 1156–1329, under a series of charters from the Bishop of Lincoln. After his death, Henry III tried to bring order to the country, but the mercenary Robert de Gaugy refused to yield Newark Castle to the Bishop of Lincoln, its rightful owner. This led to the Dauphin of France (later King Louis VIII of France) laying an eight-day siege on behalf of the king, ended by an agreement to pay the mercenary to leave. Around the time of Edward III&#x27;s death in 1377, &quot;Poll tax records show an adult population of 1,178, excluding beggars and clergy, making Newark one of the biggest 25 or so towns in England.&quot;

In 1457 a flood swept away the bridge over the Trent. Although there was no legal requirement to do so, the Bishop of Lincoln, John Chadworth, funded a new bridge of oak with stone defensive towers at either end. In January 1571 or 1572, the composer Robert Parsons fell into the swollen River Trent at Newark and drowned.
After the break with Rome in the 16th century, the establishment of the Church of England, and the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII had the Vicar of Newark, Henry Lytherland, executed for refusing to acknowledge the king as head of the Church. The dissolution affected Newark&#x27;s political landscape. Even more radical changes came in 1547, when the Bishop of Lincoln exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an alderman and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by Elizabeth I.

Charles I reincorporated the town under a mayor and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under James II, continued to govern the corporation until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

===The Civil War===
In the English Civil War, Newark was a Royalist stronghold, Charles I having raised his standard in nearby Nottingham. &quot;Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by the King after his own surrender.&quot; It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided Nottingham, Grantham, Northampton, Gainsborough and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. In 1644 Newark was besieged by forces from Nottingham, Lincoln and Derby, until relieved in March by Prince Rupert.

Parliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir Marmaduke Langdale. Newark cavalry fought with the king&#x27;s forces, which were decisively defeated in the Battle of Naseby, near Leicester in June 1645.

The final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town&#x27;s defences had been much strengthened. Two major forts had been built just outside the town, one called the Queen&#x27;s Sconce to the south-west, and another, the King&#x27;s Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2¼ miles around the town. The King&#x27;s May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town&#x27;s garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen&#x27;s Sconce was left largely untouched; its remains are in Sconce and Devon Park.

===Georgian era and early 19th century===
About 1770 the Great North Road around Newark (now the A616) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special Act of Parliament in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by John Carr of York and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building, housing a museum and art gallery. In 1775 the Duke of Newcastle, at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town&#x27;s major thoroughfares today.

A noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766–1799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform and for selling a pamphlet by Thomas Paine.

In a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred Newark tenants whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).

J. S. Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830–1840, contributed to &quot;The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax&quot; (London, 1904), a book about the Corn Laws: &quot;Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying &#x27;Bread or blood&#x27;.&quot;

===19th–21st centuries===
Many buildings and much industry appeared in the Victorian era. The buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836–1837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N. Nicholson Trent Ironworks (1840s), Northgate Railway Station (1851), North End Wesleyan Chapel (1868), St Leonard&#x27;s Anglican Church (1873), the Baptist Chapel (1876), the Primitive Methodist Chapel (1878), Newark Hospital (1881), Ossington Coffee Palace (1882), Gilstrap Free Library (1883), the Market Hall (1884), the Unitarian Chapel (1884), the Fire Station (1889), the Waterworks (1898), and the School of Science and Art (1900).

The Ossington Coffee Palace was built by Lady Charlotte Ossington, daughter of the 4th Duke of Portland and widow of a former Speaker of the House of Commons, Viscount Ossington. It was designed to be a Temperance alternative to pubs and coaching inns.

These changes and industrial growth raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the century. The Sherwood Avenue Drill Hall opened in 1914 as the First World War began.
In the Second World War there were several RAF stations within a few miles of Newark, many holding squadrons of the Polish Air Force. A plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials. This is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also has 49 scattered burials from the First World War. A memorial cross to the Polish airmen buried there was unveiled in 1941 by President Raczkiewicz, ex-President of the Polish Republic and head of the wartime Polish government in London, supported by Władysław Sikorski, head of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile in 1939–1943. When the two died – Sikorski in 1943 and Raczkiewicz in 1947 – they were buried at the foot of the monument. Sikorski&#x27;s remains were returned to Poland in 1993, but his former grave in Newark remains as a monument. RAF Winthorpe was opened in 1940 and declared inactive in 1959. The site is now the location of the Newark Air Museum.

The main industries in Newark in the last hundred years have been clothing, bearings, pumps, agricultural machinery and pine furniture, and the refining of sugar. British Sugar still has one of its sugar-beet processing factories to the north of the town near the A616 (Great North Road). There have been several factory closures especially since the 1950s. The breweries that closed in the 20th century included James Hole and Warwicks-and-Richardsons.

==Population==
Newark had a population of 30,345 at the 2021 census, a 10% increase from the 27,700 of the 2011 census. The ONS Mid Year Population Estimates for 2007 indicated that the population had risen to some 26,700. Another estimate (2009): &quot;The population of Newark itself was 27,700 and the district of Newark and Sherwood has a population of 75,000 at the 2011 Census. The Office for National Statistics also identifies a wider &quot;Newark-on-Trent built up area&quot; with a 2011 census population of 43,363 and a &quot;Newark-on-Trent built up area subdivision&quot; with a population of 37,084. In the 2011 census, 77 per cent of adults in the town are employed, according to the latest ONS data.

==Geography==
By road, Newark is from Nottingham, from Lincoln and from Leicester. All are connected to the town by the A46 road. The town is also around from Mansfield, from Grantham, from Sleaford, from Southwell and from Bingham.

Newark lies on the bank of the River Trent, with the River Devon running as a tributary through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the Fosse Way, Newark originally grew around Newark Castle, now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings.

Newark forms a single built-up area with the neighbouring parish of Balderton to the south-east. To the south, on the A46 road, is Farndon, and to the north Winthorpe.

Newark&#x27;s growth and development have been enhanced by one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the East Coast Main Line and the Nottingham to Lincoln route. &quot;Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,&quot; though it industrialised somewhat in the Victorian era and later had an ironworks, engineering, brewing and a sugar refinery.

The A1 bypass was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples. The single-carriageway, £34 million A46 opened in October 1990.

Following years of planning, preparatory work was started in 2023 to create an extension and bypass-link from the A46 at Farndon, via Middlebeck to the A1 near Fernwood.

==Governance==

The parliamentary borough of Newark returned two Members of Parliament (MPs) to the Unreformed House of Commons from 1673. It was the last borough to be created before the Reform Act. William Ewart Gladstone, later Prime Minister, became its MP in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, in 1837, and in 1841 twice, but possibly due to his support of the repeal of the Corn Laws and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.

Newark elections were central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to Harold Laski, the Chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, led Laski to sue the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, which had reported him as saying Labour might take power by violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the action. In the 1997 general election, Newark returned Fiona Jones of the Labour Party. Jones and her election agent Des Whicher were convicted of submitting a fraudulent declaration of expenses, but the conviction was overturned on appeal.

Newark&#x27;s former MP Patrick Mercer, Conservative held the position of Shadow Minister for Homeland Security from June 2003 until March 2007, when he had to resign after making racially contentious comments to &quot;The Times&quot;.

At a by-election on 5 June 2014 after the resignation of Patrick Mercer, he was replaced by the Conservative Robert Jenrick, who was re-elected at the general election of 7 May 2015.

Newark has three local-government tiers: Newark Town Council, Newark and Sherwood District Council and Nottinghamshire County Council. The 39 district councillors cover waste, planning, environmental health, licensing, car parks, housing, leisure and culture. It opened a national Civil War Centre and Newark Museum in May 2015. The area elects ten councillors to Nottinghamshire County Council. It provides children&#x27;s services, adult care, and highways and transport services. 

===Newark Town Council===
The town has an elected council of 18 members from seven wards: Beacon (5 councillors), Bridge (3), Castle (2), Devon (5), Magnus (1), Sleaford (1) and South (1). Newark Town Council has taken on some responsibilities devolved by Newark and Sherwood District Council, including parks, open spaces and Newark Market. It also runs events such as the LocAle and Weinfest, a museum in the Town Hall, and allotments.

A new police station costing £7 million opened in October 2006.

==Education==
The town has three main mixed secondary schools:
* The oldest, Magnus Church of England Academy, founded in 1531 by the diplomat Thomas Magnus, lies close to the town centre.
* The Newark Academy is in neighbouring Balderton (previously The Grove School). It underwent a £25 million rebuild in 2016 after a long campaign.
* In 2020 the Suthers School opened.

The town&#x27;s several primary schools include a new school in the Middlebeck development on the town&#x27;s southern edge, opened in September 2021.

Newark College, part of the Lincoln College, Lincolnshire Group, is situated on Friary Road, Newark, where it is home to the School of Musical Instrument Crafts. This school, which opened in 1972, has courses to train craftspeople to make and repair guitars, violins, and woodwind instruments, and to tune and restore pianos.

==Economy==
British Sugar PLC runs a mill on the outskirts that opened in 1921. It has 130 permanent employees and processes 1.6 million tonnes of sugar beet produced by about 800 UK growers, at an average distance of 28 miles from the factory. Of the output, 250,000 tonnes are processed and supplied to food and drink manufacturers in the UK and across Europe. At the heart of the Newark factory&#x27;s operations is a combined heat and power (CHP) plant, with boilers fuelled by natural gas to meet the site&#x27;s steam and electricity requirements and contribute to the grid enough power for 800 homes. The installation is rated under the government CHP environmental quality-assurance scheme.

Other major employers are a bearings factory (part of the NSK group) with some 200 employees, and Laurens Patisseries, part of the food group Bakkavör since May 2006, which bought it for £130 million. It employs over 1,000. In 2007, Currys opened a £30 million national distribution centre next to the A17 near the A46 roundabout, and moved its national distribution centre there in 2005, with over 1,400 staff employed at the site at peak times. Flowserve, formerly Ingersoll Dresser Pumps, has a manufacturing facility in the town. Project Telecom in Brunel Drive was bought by Vodafone in 2003 for a reported £163 million. Since 1985, Newark has been host to the biggest antiques outlet in Europe, the Newark International Antiques and Collectors Fair, held bi-monthly at Newark Showground. Newark has plentiful antique shops and centres.

==Culture==
Newark hosts Newark Rugby Union Football Club, whose players have included Dusty Hare, John Wells, Greig Tonks and Tom Ryder. The town has a leisure centre in Bowbridge Road, opened in 2016.

Newark and Sherwood Concert Band, with over 50 regular players, has performed at numerous area events in the last few years. Also based in Newark are the Royal Air Force Music Charitable Trust and Lincolnshire Chamber Orchestra.

The Palace Theatre in Appletongate is Newark&#x27;s main entertainment venue, offering drama, live music, dance and film.

The National Civil War Centre and Newark Museum, next to the Palace Theatre in Appletongate in the town centre, opened in 2015 to interpret Newark&#x27;s part in the English Civil War in the 17th century and explore its wider implications.

The district was ranked in a survey reported in 2020 as one of the best places to live in the UK.

==Landmarks and treasures==

*The Market Place is the town&#x27;s focal point. It includes &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Head&quot;, one of the town&#x27;s old pubs.
*The Church of St. Mary Magdalene is a Grade I listed building notable for its tower and octagonal spire ( high), the tallest in the county for a church. It was heavily restored in the mid-19th century by Sir George Gilbert Scott. The reredos was added by Sir Ninian Comper.
*Newark Castle was built by the Trent by Alexander of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln in 1123, who established it as a mint. Of the original Norman stronghold, the chief remains are the gate-house, a crypt and the tower at the south-west angle. King John died there on the night of 18 October 1216. In the reign of Edward III it was being used as a state prison. In the English Civil War it was garrisoned for Charles I and endured three sieges. Its dismantling was begun in 1646, after the royalist surrender.
*The 16th-century Governor&#x27;s House, named after Sir Richard Willis, Castle Governor in the English Civil War, is in Stodman Street. Now housing a bread shop and cafe, it is a Grade I listed building.

===Newark Torc===

The Newark Torc, a silver and gold Iron Age torc, was the first found in Nottinghamshire. It resembles that of the Snettisham Hoard. Uncovered in 2005, it occupies a field on the town&#x27;s outskirts, and in 2008 was acquired by Newark and Sherwood District Council. The torc was displayed at the British Museum in London until the opening of the National Civil War Centre and Newark Museum in May 2015. It is now shown in the museum galleries.

==Churches and other religious sites==
Newark&#x27;s churches include the Grade I listed parish church, St Mary Magdalene. Other Anglican parish churches include Christ Church in Boundary Road and St Leonard&#x27;s in Lincoln Road. The Catholic Holy Trinity Church was consecrated in 1979. Other places of worship include three Methodist churches, the Baptist Church in Albert Street, and the Church of Promise, founded in 2007.

In 2014 the Newark Odinist Temple, a Grade II listed building in Bede House Lane, was consecrated according to the rites of the Odinist Fellowship, making it the first heathen temple operating in England in modern times.

==Transport==
Newark is a commuter town, with many residents travelling to Lincoln and Nottingham and even London.

Newark has two railway stations. The East Coast Main Line serves Newark North Gate railway station with links to in about an hour and a quarter, and north to , Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne and . Newark Castle railway station on the – – line provides cross-country regional links. The two meet at the last flat crossing in Britain. Grade separation has been proposed.

<doc id="177235" wikidata="Q921326" url="?curid=177235" title="Brixham">
<text>Brixham is a coastal town and civil parish in the borough of Torbay in the county of Devon, in the south-west of England. As of the 2021 census, Brixham had a population of 16,825. It is one of the main three centres of the borough, along with Paignton and Torquay.

It is believed that the name Brixham originates from the personal name of an early resident, Brioc, followed by the Old English suffix, &quot;ham&quot; meaning home. The town, which is predominantly hilly, is built around a natural harbour, which in addition to leisure craft, provides anchorage for what is now one of England&#x27;s (but not the UK&#x27;s) largest remaining commercial fishing fleets. A conspicuous local tourist attraction is the permanently moored replica of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s ship &quot;Golden Hind&quot;.

Historically Brixham was made up of two separate communities connected only by a marshy lane. In Fishtown, in the immediate vicinity of the harbour, as the name suggests, the residents made a living mainly from fishing and related trades while inland in the vicinity of what is now St Mary&#x27;s Square, on the road out of town to the south-west in the direction of Kingswear, is Cowtown, which made its living from agriculture. St Mary&#x27;s Square is overlooked by a sizeable church standing on the site of a Saxon original.

On 5 November 1688, the Dutch prince, William of Orange landed in Brixham, with 40,000 soldiers, sailors and volunteers, prior to marching on London to be crowned King William III as part of the Glorious Revolution.

== History ==
The first evidence of settlement dates from the Saxon period, it being possible that settlers arrived by sea from Hampshire in the 6th century or overland in about the year 800.

Brixham was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Briseham&quot; with a population of 39.

Brixham was part of the former Haytor Hundred. In 1334, the town&#x27;s value was assessed as being one pound, twelve shillings and eightpence. William de Whithurst, a distinguished Crown official and judge in Ireland, became parish priest of Brixham in 1350. By 1524 Brixham&#x27;s value had risen to £24 and sixteen shillings. In 1536 the town was recorded as being a borough, but the status was later lost. The presence of a market is recorded from 1822.

The oldest and largest of Brixham&#x27;s two Anglican churches is St. Mary&#x27;s, approximately inland from the sea in the area of the town once known as Cowtown. The present church, dating from approximately 1360, is the third to occupy the site (an ancient Celtic burial place), the first and second having been a Saxon building of wooden construction and a Norman one of stone respectively.
On 5 November 1688, the Dutch prince, William of Orange landed in Brixham, with 40,000 soldiers, sailors and volunteers, prior to marching on London to be crowned King William III as part of the Glorious Revolution. There is a statue and commemorative plaque marking the event close to the Golden Hind replica in the Inner Harbour, while a road at the other end of the harbour, which leads up a steep hill to where the Dutch made their camp, is still called &quot;Overgang&quot;, Dutch for passage or crossing.

Built in around 1736, Brixham boasts what is believed to be the world&#x27;s only coffin-shaped house, the story going that its unusual design results from an argument between a father and his prospective son-in-law. Upon being asked for his daughter&#x27;s hand in marriage, the father answered that, &quot;I would rather see my daughter in a coffin than married to you.&quot; Not to be so easily discouraged, the prospective husband promised that the father&#x27;s wishes would be met and built the coffin-shaped house, his action so impressing the bride&#x27;s father that the latter gave his blessings to the marriage.

Built in 1815, the tower of All Saints&#x27; Church is a prominent landmark overlooking the centre of Brixham. Vicar of this church from 1824 to his death in 1847, though much absent because of ill health, was the Rev. Francis Lyte, who is well known for the writing, in the last weeks of his life, of the famous hymn &quot;Abide With Me&quot; at his home, Berry Head House, (now Brixham&#x27;s largest hotel) on the north-eastern edge of the town.

Most of the small picturesque terraced cottages built during the nineteenth century and earlier, along the narrow streets overlooking Brixham Harbour were occupied by fishermen and their families and others involved in related trades such as boatbuilding and sailmaking, while housing further away from the harbour in Cowtown and Higher Brixham tends to date from between the 1930s and the 1970s.

Opened in 1863, the British Seaman&#x27;s Boys&#x27; Home was established in Brixham by William Gibbs of Tyntesfield for the bringing up and education of orphaned sons of deceased British seamen. It was closed in 1988 and the building it once occupied, Grenville House in Berry Head Road, is now an outdoor education centre.

On the night of 10/11 January 1866, Brixham was subjected to a storm of unusual severity, which, after the wind had veered to the east around midnight, a direction from which Torbay is not well sheltered, sank at least eleven local trawlers and a visiting French boat. Four Brixham fishermen were drowned. Much greater damage was done to the large number of vessels, at least 62 in number, some by the standards of the time quite large ships, en route to other ports which had sought shelter in Torbay from the storm. Forty of these ships were driven from their anchors and for the most part wrecked along of the local coastline. It is not known how many of their crew members and passengers were killed; the committee set up to help the victims of the disaster estimated that at least 70 had died, while other sources, in particular contemporary newspaper accounts, made claims of more than 150 fatalities. A memorial marking a mass grave in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard memorializes 25 unidentified victims and four named ones. The estimated financial cost of vessel and cargo losses ranges between £150,000 (equivalent to £20 million in 2022) and £200,000 (£26.5 million in 2022).

A direct result of this disaster was that, thanks to money raised by the citizens of Exeter, Brixham acquired its first Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat, and has maintained a lifeboat station ever since. To date Brixham lifeboat crews (all volunteers) have been awarded 26 awards for bravery.

Brixham was joined to the railway network in February 1868 by the short Torbay and Brixham Railway which carried both passengers and goods (particularly fish), but the line, rendered progressively less and less commercially viable by the expansion of the road transport network in the course of the twentieth century, finally fell victim in 1963 to the Beeching cuts and the course of the old line, though still recognisable in places, has largely been built over, as has the site of Brixham railway station.

Due to Brixham&#x27;s increasing popularity as a tourist destination following the Second World War, a number of holiday camps were built, for example Pontin&#x27;s Wall Park and Dolphin camps, the latter being one of the company&#x27;s biggest. It closed in 1991 after its main entertainment complex was destroyed by fire and the site has now been redeveloped with residential housing.

On 28 April 1967, a UFO reportedly hovered above Brixham for 80 minutes.

On the morning of 3 September 1973, a Jodel D. 117 G-AVEI light aircraft crashed due to engine failure on a residential bungalow in Higher Ranscombe Road, Brixham, killing its twenty-five year old pilot and his two small children. His wife, though very seriously injured, survived.

=== Maritime ===

There has probably been fishing in Brixham in one form or another from the settlement&#x27;s very beginnings in the Saxon period. When this developed into a recognisable industry no one any longer knows, but by 1406 it had grown sufficiently large to warrant regulation by the Bailiff of the Water of the Dart, an officer of the Duchy of Cornwall, a legacy of this being that up until 1902 Brixham fishing boats were registered at Dartmouth rather than their actual home port.

Due to being sheltered from the prevailing south-westerly winds, over the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Brixham became Torbay&#x27;s largest town and main fishing port, hake being the principal fish landed. Trawl fishing was first recorded in south Devon in the 1760s with high value deep water species such as turbot, sole and plaice being landed. As a result of the development of the turnpike road system during the rest of the eighteenth century, the transportation of fish to markets in Exeter, Bath and even London became economically viable, this trend being substantially enhanced in the nineteenth century with the coming of the railways, although Brixham itself, not getting its own railway station until 1868, was relatively late to fully benefit from this process. During the 1820s over 120 tons on average of turbot and sole was being landed per week by a Brixham fleet of about ninety trawlers exploiting fish stocks as far west as the Irish and Welsh coasts and eastwards along the Channel as far as Hastings and Dover. Migration of Brixham fishing families up the North Sea coast led to the establishment of new fleets in Grimsby and Hull.

In time these ports would grow significantly larger than Brixham, but in the middle of the nineteenth century the town still boasted the largest fishing fleet in England, with more than 250 boats keeping well over 1,000 fishermen in employment. Catches consisted of flounder, gurnard, herring, mullet, plaice, sole, turbot and whiting, the best quality fish being sent to Exeter, Bath, Bristol and London. From 1868, once Brixham had finally been connected directly to the rail network, fish landed in the port could be delivered to London&#x27;s Billingsgate Fish Market in eight hours as opposed to three days by road.

In parallel with this expansion, over the course of the century, a major boat and shipbuilding industry grew up in the town, numerous boatyards lining the shore and catering both for the local demand for new boats and that from ports further afield. For much of the century, these yards also turned their hand to building ocean-going schooners for the fiercely competitive fruit trade with the Azores.

Other maritime trades such as sail, rope and net-making were needed as well and became a conspicuous feature of the Brixham townscape, forming an important part of the local economy in their own right.

In 1900, Brixham even had its own ice factory, a much needed addition to the town, given the large quantities of ice required to keep catches fresh and the somewhat precarious method of supply available previously, from 1869 onwards it having been imported from Stavanger in Norway, carried aboard fast sailing ships capable of making the passage in just four days. Despite their speed, in the summer months half the cargo would typically be lost to melting in transit.

However, reluctant and unable on financial grounds to replace sailing trawlers with faster and more powerful steam-powered ones, from the 1890 onwards and into the early twentieth century, Brixham&#x27;s fishing industry went into decline, in particular being unable to compete with North Sea ports such as Lowestoft and Grimsby in the lucrative Dogger Bank fishing grounds. This decline was further compounded by the outbreak of World War One in 1914 and the resultant loss of fishing boats to U-boat attack and trawler crews being called upon for military service. The inter-war years proved no better. In 1928 only 2160 tons of fish were landed at Brixham, compared to 94,000 at Hull, and by the outbreak of World War Two in 1939 the Brixham fishing fleet had dwindled to only six boats.

The arrival during World War Two of refugee fishermen from Belgium helped to revitalise the fishing industry and brought with it a much needed knowledge of diesel engines.

A definite upturn in the industry&#x27;s fortunes was seen in 1960 following the adoption of larger trawlers from the Netherlands and by 1966 the fishing fleet had grown to 45 boats. In 1969 the fleet had grown to 70 boats with £247,000 worth of fish being landed at Brixham and over the next two decades £4.6 million was invested in infrastructure projects such as building a new fish market and ice plant. In 1991 more than 800 people were employed directly or indirectly within the industry. In 2000 Brixham became England&#x27;s premier fishing port, landing a total of £18.4 million worth of fish. In 2021 £43.6 million worth of fish was landed.

The modern boats are diesel-driven, but a few of the famous old sailing trawlers have been preserved. Owned by not for profit organisations and registered as historic vessels on the National Historic Ships register it is possible to sail on these big wooden built, red sailed boats. They depend on income from guests to keep them sailing, such as &quot;Pilgrim of Brixham&quot; (1895) and &quot;Vigilance of Brixham&quot; (1926).

Hundreds of ships have been wrecked on the rocks around the town. Brixham men have always known the dangers but even they were taken by surprise by a terrible storm that blew up on the night of 10 January 1866. The fishing boats only had sails then and could not get back into harbour because gale-force winds and the high waves were against them. To make things worse, the beacon on the breakwater was swept away, and in the black darkness they could not determine their position. According to local legend, their wives brought everything they could carry, including furniture and bedding, to make a big bonfire on the quayside to guide their men home. Fifty vessels were wrecked and more than one hundred people died in the storm; when dawn broke, the wreckage stretched for nearly up the coast.
Hearing of this tragedy, the citizens of Exeter gave money to set up what became the Royal National Lifeboat Institution&#x27;s Brixham Lifeboat in 1866. Now known as Torbay Lifeboat Station, it operates a all-weather lifeboat and a inshore lifeboat. The crews have a history of bravery, with 52 awards for gallantry. The boathouse can be visited and memorials to the brave deeds seen; on special occasions, visitors can go on board the boat. Two maroons (bangs) are the signal for the lifeboat to be launched.

Smuggling was more profitable than fishing, but if the men were caught, they were hanged. There are many legends about the local gangs and how they evaded the Revenue men. One humorous poem describes how a notorious local character, Bob Elliott (&quot;Resurrection Bob&quot;), could not run away because he had gout and hid in a coffin. Another villain was caught in possession but evaded capture by pretending to be the Devil, rising out of the morning mists. On another occasion when there was a cholera epidemic, some Brixham smugglers drove their cargo up from the beach in a hearse, accompanied by a bevy of supposed mourners following the cortege drawn by horses with muffled hooves.

The town&#x27;s outer harbour is protected by a long breakwater, useful for sea angling. In winter, this is a site for purple sandpiper birds.

To the east of Brixham, and sheltering its harbour, lies the coastal headland of Berry Head with a lighthouse, Iron Age fort and national nature reserve.

=== Military ===

From at least the reign of Elizabeth I to World War Two Torbay was a militarily important site due to its sheltered anchorage, being of particular important in the late eighteenth century when Brixham functioned as the Royal Navy&#x27;s victualling station for the Western Approaches. This role was of particular importance during the American War of Independence of 1775 to 1783.

It is known that a battery of cannons was established as a defensive measure against the threat of attack by Spain in the area now known as Battery Gardens as long ago as 1586 and was continuously maintained until 1664.

The battery was reactivated in November 1688 when William, Prince of Orange&#x27;s army landed in Brixham and camped on Furzeham Common, guns being positioned to protect the fleet, the town and the road to the town of Paignton, away.

When France allied itself with America in 1778 and with Spain in 1779, the Board of Ordnance (the equivalent in its day of today&#x27;s Ministry of Defence) decided that, in conjunction with other naval stations along the English south coast, Brixham was to be protected by gun emplacements, the battery on the Battery Gardens site being the most westerly protecting the town.

Between 1794 and 1804 two substantial fortified garrisons were constructed on the site of a Saxon hill fort at Berry Head, an elevated site to the east of Brixham. A third fort had been planned, but was never built. The forts were maintained as important defensive positions during the Napoleonic Wars though never fired their cannons in anger, and slowly fell into military disuse during the course of the rest of the nineteenth century, now forming part of the Berry Head National Nature Reserve.

In July 1815, the British Royal Navy warship, HMS Bellerophon, spent a week anchored off of Brixham, the former French emperor, Napoleon Bonaparte, being held on board as a prisoner following his capture after the Battle of Waterloo. His presence on board, quickly becoming known to the local populace, the ship briefly became a major tourist attraction. He spent a total of three weeks off the Devon coast while the UK authorities decided what to do with Bonaparte. He was then transferred to another ship, HMS Northumberland, and taken to St. Helena, his final place of exile.

Brixham was not directly targeted by enemy action during World War 1; though, out at sea, approximately 10% of the town&#x27;s fishing fleet, numbering about 300 vessels at the time was lost either to submarine attack or collision with mines, four boats alone being sunk in a U-boat attack in a single day in 1917. During the war there was no loss of life among fishing crews, but those who enlisted in the military were not so fortunate and the town&#x27;s war memorial lists the names of 216 local residents who died in the conflict.

During World War 2 Brixham was sporadically subjected to small scale hit and run air raids seventeen times between July 1940 and May 1943 with two raids, in May 1941 and May 1942 each resulting in a single fatality respectively. London City, a coaling hulk moored in the outer harbour, and ironically originally a German ship seized after the end of World War 1, was sunk and raised twice in July 1940 and February 1941 respectively, only to be sunk again in March 1942 and this time not raised until being salvaged for scrap years after the war. The names of 125 local residents are listed on Brixham&#x27;s war memorial as having died on military service during World War 2.

The town also saw an American military presence during the war, with slipways being built in May 1943 for training exercises for US forces. 2,500 men of the US 4th Infantry Division and 32 amphibious DD tanks embarked on 4 June 1944 for Utah Beach as part of the D-Day landings against German-occupied France.

=== Industrial ===
Limestone was quarried at Berry Head on the edge of Brixham from the mid 18th century until the 1960s, the stone being used both for agricultural lime and for building stone. At first stone was taken from both sides of the headland, but following a short period of closure due to concerns about undermining the fort&#x27;s defences in 1828, quarrying was allowed on the north (Torbay facing) side of the headland only and by the quarry&#x27;s final closure in 1969 a substantial quantity of Berry Head North Fort had been removed. The remains of the quarry are for the most part still accessible to the public and the former loading jetty is a popular venue for sea angling with locals and holidaymakers alike.

Historically iron was also mined close to Brixham, the last mine closing in 1925. With the exception of remnants of the Sharkham Point Iron Mine, there are now no extant remains of this industry.

Another mineral found in Brixham is ochre. This gave the old fishing boats their red sails, but the purpose was to protect the canvas from sea water. It was boiled in great cauldrons, together with tar, tallow and oak bark. The latter ingredient gave its name to the barking yards which were places where the hot mixture was painted on to the sails, which were then hung up to dry. The ochre was also used to make a paint. This was invented in Brixham in about 1845, and was the first substance in the world that would stop cast iron from rusting. Other types of paint were made here as well, and the works were in existence until 1961.

== Festivals and events ==
Brixham plays host to a number of festivals and events throughout the calendar year. These events are run entirely by locals and contribute significantly to the local economy.

=== Brixham Pirate Festival ===
The annual Brixham Pirate Festival usually takes place over the early May Bank Holiday, and is known for its world record attempts, live music, free entertainment and for filling Brixham with pirates. The festival is a very large event in the town, with thousands of residents and visitors attending the festival yearly.

=== BrixFest ===
BrixFest is an annual family friendly festival in Brixham, that usually takes place in May each year.

=== Fishstock Brixham ===
Fishstock Brixham is a one-day annual seafood and live music festival held in aid of the Fishermen&#x27;s Mission (RNMDSF). It is a licensed event, organised by volunteers and held inside the new Fish Market Development on the harbour side. Normally the event is held on the second Saturday of September, but the date also varies for Spring tides.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Brixham, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Brixham Town Council and Torbay Council, based in Torquay. Brixham Town Council is based at the Town Hall on New Road.

Brixham was an ancient parish. By the 1860s the parish contained two main settlements, being Lower Brixham around the harbour and Higher Brixham on higher ground to the south around the parish church. The larger settlement of Lower Brixham was made a local government district in 1862, governed by a local board. Prior to that the whole parish had been administered by its vestry in the same way as most rural areas. Higher Brixham and the rural parts of the parish continued to be governed by the vestry until 1894. The local board built itself the Town Hall on New Road in 1886 to serve as its headquarters and as a market hall and public hall.

Local boards were converted into urban district councils in December 1894, and the Lower Brixham Urban District was enlarged at the same time to cover the whole parish of Brixham. In recognition of the enlargement, at the second meeting of the urban district council in January 1895 it voted to change its name from Lower Brixham to just Brixham.

In 1968 the urban districts of Brixham and Paignton, the municipal borough of Torquay and the parish of Churston Ferrers were all abolished. A county borough called Torbay was created to cover the whole area, with some adjustments of the boundaries to neighbouring parishes at the same time, including the more rural southern part of Brixham being transferred to the parish of Kingswear. As a county borough, Torbay was administratively independent from Devon County Council. Six years later, in 1974, local government was reformed again, with Torbay becoming a non-metropolitan district and Devon County Council providing county-level services to the area again. Torbay regained its independence from the county council in 1998 when it was made a unitary authority. Torbay remains part of the ceremonial county of Devon for the purposes of lieutenancy.

From 1968 to 2007 Brixham was directly administered by Torbay Borough Council, having no lower-tier authority of its own. On 1 April 2007 a new civil parish of Brixham was created, with its council declaring the new parish to be a town and adopting the name Brixham Town Council. In 2011 ownership of Brixham Town Hall was transferred from Torbay Council to Brixham Town Council to use as its headquarters.

Brixham is part of the UK parliamentary constituency of South Devon, whose MP has been Caroline Voaden since 2024.

==Education==
Brixham has a number of schools, mostly located in the centre of residential areas.

The town has one secondary school, Brixham College.

Other schools and academies in Brixham and the surrounding area include
* Eden Park Primary School Academy
* Brixham Church of England Primary School
* Saint Margaret Clitherow Catholic Primary School

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Beacon Hill TV transmitter and the local relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon on 104.3 FM, Heart West on 96.4 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly The Breeze) on 105.5 FM, Radio Exe on 107.3 FM, and Riviera FM, a community based station which broadcast to the town on 107.9 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Herald Express which publishes on Thursdays.

== Sport ==
Brixham is home to the Brixham Archers. This is the biggest archery club in the bay and shoots outdoors at their field at Churston. Brixham Archers also use an indoor facility in Brixham. The Archery club was formed in 1969 and has been successful at county and national level competitions.

In 1874, Brixham Rugby Club was founded and became one of the founder members of Devon RFU of which six clubs are now left. They played Rugby on Furzeham Green until 1896 when they moved their present ground to New Gate Park (now Astley Park). The club will play their league fixtures in the National League 3 South West division of English rugby.

Footballer Dan Gosling, of Watford F.C., was born and raised in Brixham, and is the fourth-youngest player to have ever played for Plymouth Argyle aged 16 years and 310 days.

Brixham is also home to Brixham AFC who were founded in 2012, following the merger of Brixham United and Brixham Villa football clubs. The club play their home matches at Wall Park Ground and currently play in the South West Peninsula League Premier Division East.

==Transport==

Brixham railway station was the terminus of the Torbay and Brixham Railway. It served the town from the bay platform at Churston station until the line was closed in 1963. Some of the track bed remains in place. Houses in Harbour View Close were built on the site of the station. The Association of Train Operating Companies included Brixham as one of fourteen towns that, based on 2009 data, would benefit from a new railway service, but restoration is highly unlikely.

Although Brixham is no longer on the rail network, frequent buses taking 25 minutes connect Brixham with the national rail network at Paignton, where the bus station is conveniently situated opposite the rail station. Trains from Paignton run to destinations such as , , London Paddington and .

Torbay&#x27;s flagship bus route, Stagecoach South West service 12, operates up to every 10 minutes and has its terminus at Brixham Town Square, with the service returning to Newton Abbot via Paignton, Torquay and Kingskerswell. The service also calls at the Brixham Park and Ride site located on the A3022 (Dartmouth Road). Flat rate parking charges include a bus ride for a car&#x27;s occupants to Brixham and return.

Stagecoach service 18 take about 15 minutes for the journey from Brixham (Bank Street) to Kingswear, where a river crossing to Dartmouth can be made by ferry.

Local town services operated by both Stagecoach and Country Bus, serve Furzeham, Wall Park, Sharkham, South Bay, Higher Brixham, Summercombe and Hillhead.

There are direct National Express coach services to London via Bristol and Heathrow Airport, and Sheffield via Bristol and Birmingham.

Frequent ferry services for foot passengers operate from Brixham Harbour to Torquay between the months of April and September, the fastest taking 35 minutes. There are also seasonal ferries to Paignton. Pleasure cruises also call at Brixham Harbour en route from Torquay to Dartmouth, during the spring, summer and autumn.

<text>A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems or One hundred million million poems (original French title: &quot;Cent mille milliards de poèmes&quot;) is a book by Raymond Queneau, published in 1961. The book is a set of ten sonnets printed on card with each line on a separate strip. As all ten sonnets have not just the same rhyme scheme but the same rhyme sounds, any lines from a sonnet can be combined with any from the nine others, allowing for 1014 (= 100,000,000,000,000) different poems. When Queneau ran into trouble creating the book, he solicited the help of mathematician Francois Le Lionnais, and in the process they initiated Oulipo.

The original French version of the book was designed by Robert Massin. Two full translations into English have been published, those by John Crombie and Stanley Chapman. Beverley Charles Rowe&#x27;s translation, one that uses the same rhyme sounds, has been published online. In 1984, Edition Zweitausendeins in Frankfurt published a German translation by Ludwig Harig. In 2002, Moscow ГрантЪ published a Russian translation by Tatiana Bonch-Osmolovskaya.

In 1997, a French court decision outlawed the publication of the original poem on the Internet, citing the Queneau estate and Gallimard publishing house&#x27;s exclusive moral right.

<text>Torbay is a unitary authority with a borough status in the ceremonial county of Devon, England. It is governed by Torbay Council, based in the town of Torquay, and also includes the towns of Paignton and Brixham. The borough consists of of land around the east-facing Tor Bay, part of Lyme Bay on the English Channel. A popular tourist destination, Torbay&#x27;s sandy beaches, mild climate and recreational and leisure attractions have given rise to its nickname of the &quot;English Riviera&quot;. The neighbouring districts are South Hams and Teignbridge.

==History==
Human bones and tools found in Kents Cavern in Torquay show that people have inhabited the Torbay area since Paleolithic times. A maxilla fragment known as Kents Cavern 4 may be the oldest example of a modern human in Europe, dating back to 37,000–40,000 years ago. Roman soldiers are known to have visited Torquay during the period when Britannia formed a part of the Roman Empire; they left offerings at a curious rock formation in Kent&#x27;s Cavern, known as &quot;The Face&quot;. A Roman burial was discovered in 1993 in Paignton.

Both Brixham and Paignton appear in the Domesday Book of 1086, and Paignton was given a market charter in 1294 granting it a weekly market and annual fair. The first major building in Torquay was Torre Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery founded in 1196 and associated with the manor of Torre.

William, Prince of Orange (afterwards King William III), landed in Brixham on 5 November 1688, during the Glorious Revolution, and issued his famous declaration &quot;The Liberties of England and The Protestant Religion I Will Maintain&quot;.

Torquay&#x27;s economy, like Brixham&#x27;s, initially depended on fishing and agriculture, but in the early 19th century the area began to develop into a fashionable seaside resort, initially frequented by members of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars while the Royal Navy anchored in Tor Bay and later, as the town&#x27;s fame spread, by Victorian society.

The historic part of Paignton lies inland: salt marsh formerly occupied the low-lying coastal fringe. Kirkham House is a late-medieval stone house and the Coverdale Tower adjacent to Paignton Parish Church is named after Miles Coverdale, who published an English translation of the Bible in 1536 and became Bishop of Exeter in 1551. Paignton remained a small fishing village until the early 19th century; a new harbour was built here in 1837.

A new phase in the urban expansion of the area began when Torre railway station opened in December 1848. The railway extended to Torquay Seafront station in 1858, to Paignton in 1859 and to Brixham in 1861. As a result of its expansion, Torquay was granted borough status in 1872, and 1902 saw its first marketing campaign to summer tourists.

Torbay Golf and Country Club (now defunct) opened in 1933. The club and course closed in the mid-1950s.

Tor Bay hosted the sailing events for the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.

In the 1970s Torbay had problems with substance abuse and people living in poor conditions in houses of multiple occupation.

==Governance==

Torbay Council is the local authority for the borough. Since 1998 it has been a unitary authority, performing the functions of both a county council and district council combined. The borough contains one civil parish, Brixham, which forms a second tier of local government in that part of the borough; the rest of the borough is an unparished area.

Torbay as an administrative area was created in 1968, when the municipal borough of Torquay, the urban districts of Brixham and Paignton, and the parish of Churston Ferrers were all abolished. Torbay was created as a county borough covering the area of the abolished authorities, with some adjustments of the boundaries to neighbouring areas; the more rural southern parts from Brixham and Churston Ferrers were transferred to the parish of Kingswear, and there were more minor adjustments to the boundaries with the neighbouring parishes of Coffinswell, Kerswells and Marldon. As a county borough, Torbay was administratively independent from Devon County Council. Six years later, in 1974, local government was reformed again, with Torbay becoming a non-metropolitan district and Devon County Council providing county-level services to the area again. Torbay regained its independence from the county council in 1998 when it was made a unitary authority. Torbay remains part of the ceremonial county of Devon for the purposes of lieutenancy.

The area is represented nationally at the House of Commons by two MPs. Torquay (along with part of Paignton) is in the Torbay parliamentary constituency which was created in 1974 and was won by Steve Darling for the Liberal Democrats in 2024 having been held by Adrian Sanders of the Liberal Democrats from 1997 to 2015 and Kevin Foster for the Conservatives from 2015 to 2024. Brixham and part of Paignton fall within the South Devon constituency, which is also represented by a Liberal Democrat Caroline Voaden.

==Geography==

There are three main towns around the marine inlet of Tor Bay: Torquay in the north, Paignton in the centre, and Brixham in the south. These have become connected over the years, swallowing up villages and towns such as St Marychurch, Cockington, Churston Ferrers and Galmpton, though the latter maintains a rural feel thanks to tight conservation measures. The borough of Torbay is bordered by the South Hams to the south and west, and by Teignbridge to the north. Nearby towns include Totnes and Dartmouth in the South Hams, and Newton Abbot and Teignmouth in Teignbridge.

The southern limit of Tor Bay is Berry Head, and the northern limit is Hope&#x27;s Nose, although Torquay itself stretches further north into Babbacombe Bay, where the beaches at Oddicombe, Babbacombe and Maidencombe can be found; these are noted for their interesting Breccia cliffs. Torbay&#x27;s many geological features have led to the establishment of the English Riviera Geopark; as of July 2008, this is the sole urban geopark of the 53 geoparks worldwide.

Because of the mild climate, Torbay palm trees are a common sight along the coast. However, these are in fact not palms but &quot;Cordyline australis&quot;, originating from New Zealand where it is known as &quot;cabbage tree&quot;. These trees also flourish elsewhere in the UK. It is suggested that the popularity of cabbage trees in Torbay is attributable to their first being introduced to the UK in that region.

==Settlements==

Torbay includes:

*Torquay including suburbs
*Paignton including suburbs
*Brixham including suburbs
*Broadsands
*Churston Ferrers
*Galmpton
*Goodrington

==Demography==
The 2011 census confirmed Torbay&#x27;s reputation as a retirement area, with a higher proportion of all age groups over the age of 50 than nationally. However compared to 2001, age groups 75-79 and 80-85 both showed a decline of around 4%, compared to increases of 1.5% and 14% for the whole country.

Some other statistics from the 2011 census:



==Economy==
Torbay&#x27;s main activities are public service; serving its large retired community such as in hospitality, construction and repairs; tourism; the transport sector including boats; distribution; retail; fishing; the digital, media and arts sector. It has a few established schools and accredited teachers/hosts for the short-term study of English as a foreign language.

The fishing port of Brixham is home to one of England and Wales&#x27; most successful fishing fleets and regularly lands more value than any UK port outside Scotland. It is also a base for Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard and the Torbay Lifeboat Station.

Torbay has been twinned with Hameln in Lower Saxony, Germany since 1973; and with Hellevoetsluis in the Netherlands since 1989.

==Deprivation and urban renewal==

The Melville Street, Warren Road, Rock Road and Coburg Place area of Torbay, also known as Melville Hill, has experienced deprivation and violence since the 1970s. This is an historic area with 44 Grade II listed buildings.

In 2013, a Healthwatch report for the council found that the area had high levels of houses in multiple occupation, &quot;a fairly transient community&quot; and heavy drug use. The report stated that Melville Hill had &quot;a historic reputation as a dumping ground for transient, out of work single people with chaotic lifestyles&quot;, but that most residents felt it was a friendly area. In 2014, the council said that the area had &quot;significant challenge ... from car parking, poor quality public realm, bin storage, rat running, ASB, HMOs, lack of community space/play area, links to the town centre&quot;. In 2015, the local health authority noted that residents had a lower life expectancy than in other areas of Torbay, that the proportion of people in the area who had mental ill health or learning disabilities were high, that the suicide rate was higher than elsewhere in the South West, and that many residents were either unemployed or earnt low wages.

The local authority first set up a &quot;Making Melville Marvellous&quot; project to support urban renewal in 2013, but this did not lead to results. In 2020 the local authority identified £100,000 of funding from adult social care to start the project again. The aims include supporting people who misuse substances, improving the quality of housing and developing community.

==Education==
==Transport==

===Roads===
Torbay is beyond the motorway network and is primarily served by:
* A38 and A380 roads from Exeter to Tweenaways Cross, Paignton; this is dualled each way as far as Churscombe Cross, except for a single carriageway flyover at Penn Inn roundabout 
* A379 follows a coastal route from Teignmouth, passes through Torquay and Paignton, then goes on to Dartmouth
* A385 road goes inland to Totnes
* A3022 road serves all three towns and varies between dual and single carriageway.

===Buses===
Bus services are largely operated by Stagecoach South West, with some routes run by Torbay Minibuses and County Bus.

===Railway===
Torbay has three stations on the National Rail network, with services operated by Great Western Railway:
* Torquay railway station is close to Torre Abbey Sands
* Torre railway station is inland on the road from Torquay to Newton Abbot
* Paignton railway station serves that town and links with the heritage Dartmouth Steam Railway to Kingswear, connecting via the Dart ferry to Dartmouth. CrossCountry also provides a limited service here.

A new station at Edginswell was planned to open in December 2018 as part of the proposed Devon Metro but lack of funding prevented construction. Approval of planning permission expired November 2019, but a new application for funding was made in June 2020 for a new design incorporating lifts instead of ramps. If government funding is approved, a new planning application would be made. The station was awarded £7.8m from the New Stations Fund in November 2020.

<text>Downland, chalkland, chalk downs or just downs are areas of open chalk hills, such as the North Downs. This term is used to describe the characteristic landscape in southern England where chalk is exposed at the surface. The name &quot;downs&quot; is derived from the Celtic word &quot;dun&quot;, meaning &quot;fort&quot; or &quot;fastness&quot; (and by extension &quot;fortified settlement&quot;, from which it entered English as &quot;town&quot;, similar to Germanic &quot;burg&quot;/&quot;burough&quot;), though the original meaning would have been &quot;hill&quot;, as early forts were commonly hillforts - compare Germanic &quot;burg&quot; (fort) and &quot;berg&quot; (mountain).

==Distribution==

The largest area of downland in southern England is formed by Salisbury Plain, mainly in Wiltshire. To the southwest, downlands continue via Cranborne Chase into Dorset as the Dorset Downs and southwards through Hampshire as the Hampshire Downs onto the Isle of Wight. To the northeast, downlands continue along the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills through parts of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and into Cambridgeshire. To the east downlands are found north of the Weald in Surrey, Kent and part of Greater London, forming the North Downs. To the southeast the downlands continue into West Sussex and East Sussex as the South Downs. Similar chalk hills are also found further north in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire where they are known as the Wolds.

==Geology==

The Chalk Group is a sequence of Upper Cretaceous limestones. The dominant lithology is relatively soft porous white chalk with only poorly-defined bedding. The chalk is classified as a biomicrite, with microscopic coccoliths and other fine-grained fossil debris in a matrix of micrite mud. Small amounts of silica were also deposited, mainly from sponge spicules, which moved during diagenesis and accumulated to form flints. The Chalk Group either directly overlies the impermeable uppermost Lower Cretaceous Gault Clay or permeable Upper Greensand Formation above the Gault Clay.

Since its deposition, the chalk in southern England has been uplifted, faulted, fractured and folded by the distant effects of the Alpine Orogeny. The fracturing has greatly increased the chalk&#x27;s permeability, such that it is a major aquifer. Sedimentary basins formed by rifting during the Triassic to Early Cretaceous were inverted during the Late Paleogene to Miocene leading to the formation of structures such as the Wealden Anticline and the Portland-Wight Monocline. Later erosion has produced the characteristic ridges of the downland landscape. The landscape was further modified during the Quaternary period by the area&#x27;s proximity to the southern edge of the ice sheets formed during the last ice age. These periglacial effects included significant amounts of dissolution of the chalk and the modification of existing valleys due to a combination of frozen ground and snowmelt.

==Formation==

Downland develops when chalk rock becomes exposed at the surface. The chalk slowly erodes to form characteristic rolling hills and valleys. As the Cretaceous chalk layer in southern England is typically tilted, chalk downland hills often have a marked scarp slope on one side, which is very steep, and a much gentler dip slope on the other. Where the downs meet the sea, characteristic white chalk cliffs form, such as the White Cliffs of Dover and Beachy Head.

==Hydrology==
Chalk deposits are generally very permeable, so the height of the water table in chalk hills rises in winter and falls in summer. This leads to characteristic chalk downland features such as dry valleys or coombes, and seasonally-flowing streams or winterbournes. The practice of extracting water from this aquifer, in order to satisfy the increasing demand for water, may be putting some of these streams under stress.

In the valleys below the downs at the base of the chalk layer, greensand or gault clay comes to the surface and at the interface at the top of the gault a springline can occur where water emerges from the porous chalk or the underlying greensand. Along this line, settlements and farms were often built, as on the higher land no water was available. This is demonstrated very clearly beneath the scarp of the White Horse Hills, above the Vale of White Horse. In many chalk downland areas there is no surface water at all other than artificially created dewponds.

==Soil==
The soil profile of chalk downland in England is a thin soil overlaying the parent chalk. Weathering of the chalk has created a characteristic soil known as rendzina. Unlike many soils in which there are easily distinguished layers or soil horizons, a chalk rendzina soil consists of only a shallow dark humus rich surface layer which grades through a lighter brown hillwash containing small pellets of chalk, to the white of the chalk itself. This is largely because of the purity of the chalk, which is about 98% calcium carbonate, and the consequent absence of soil-building clay minerals which are abundant, for example, in valley floors.

Steep slopes on chalk downland develop a ribbed pattern of grass covered horizontal steps a foot or two high. Although subsequently emphasised by cattle and sheep walking along them, these terracettes (commonly known as sheep tracks) were formed by the movement of soil downhill, a process known as soil creep.

==Habitat==
The dominant habitat in chalk downland is typically calcareous grassland, formed by grazing from both livestock and wild animals. Chalk downland is often unsuitable for intensive agriculture, horticulture, or development because of the nutrient-poor, shallow soil and difficult slopes. For this reason downland often survived uncultivated when other, more easily worked land was ploughed or reseeded. This shallow soil structure makes downland ecosystems extremely fragile and easy to destroy. With modern machinery and fertilising techniques, it has become possible to use some previously uncultivated downland for farming, and the decline of extensive grazing has meant that many areas of downland, neither cultivated nor grazed, revert to scrub or other less rare habitat, essentially destroying the delicate calcareous grassland. The UK cover of lowland calcareous grassland has suffered a sharp decline in extent since the middle of the twentieth century. There are no comprehensive figures, but a sample of chalk sites in England surveyed in 1966 and 1980 showed a 20% loss in that period and an assessment of chalk grassland in Dorset found that over 50% had been lost between the mid-1950s and the early 1990s. Much remaining chalk downland has been protected against future development to preserve its unique biodiversity.

<text>Kelsall is a village and civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It is located around east of Chester, west of Northwich, and north west of Tarporley. The village is situated on Kelsall Hill, a part of the Mid-Cheshire Ridge, the broken line of sandstone hills that divide the west Cheshire Plain from its eastern counterpart. The ridge includes other hills including Peckforton, Beeston, Frodsham, and Helsby.

==Geology==
The western part of the parish (west of the Peckforton Fault) is underlain by the Wilmslow Sandstone Formation. East of the fault, the bedrock is largely Tarporley Siltstone with the underlying Helsby Sandstone occurring in some areas.

The lower ground in the west is largely covered by glacial till whilst higher ground in the east is free of superficial deposits. A small area of glacio-fluvial sands and gravels is mapped in the centre of the parish. A narrow strip of alluvium is associated with Salter&#x27;s Brook.

The Peckforton Fault runs into the parish from the SE then turns north. It downthrows to the east. Two parallel unnamed faults, both downthrowing to the west, run NNE–SSW through Kelsall village, their southern ends terminating at the Peckforton Fault. They terminate against a short ENE–WSW aligned fault with a northerly downthrow at the northern end of the parish. The Clotton Fault which downthrows to the east runs NNW–SSE through the western part of the parish. The rocks within the faulted blocks have a gentle to moderate easterly dip.

==History==

On Christmas Eve, December 1944, a V-1 flying bomb exploded near Street Farm to the south of the village. It had been one of several aerial-launched rockets fired at Manchester by the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. This explosion would be the most westerly impact of a V1 bomb during the Second World War.

==Demographics==
At the 2001 census the population of Kelsall civil parish was 2,525, increasing to 2,609 at the 2011 census. The total population of the Kelsall local government ward, which also included the village of Ashton Hayes, was recorded as 3,439. This ward had been amalgamated with Tarvin by the time of the 2011 Census.

==Amenities==
The village contains two churches, primary school, community centre, doctors&#x27; surgery, chemist, local store, butchers shop, four public houses, farm shop), and nursing and residential home. The Kelsall and District Rural Amenities Society (KADRAS) was formed in the late 1960s in order to stimulate public interest in the care and development of Kelsall&#x27;s history, beauty and character.

The village also hosts the annual Chester Folk Festival every May. The £3.82m, two-mile A54 bypass opened in October 1986.

<doc id="177245" wikidata="Q1749011" url="?curid=177245" title="The O'Jays">
<text>The O&#x27;Jays are an American R&amp;B group from Canton, Ohio, formed in summer 1958 and originally consisting of Eddie Levert, Walter Lee Williams, William Powell, Bobby Massey, and Bill Isles. The O&#x27;Jays made their first chart appearance with the minor hit &quot;Lonely Drifter&quot; in 1963, but reached their greatest level of success once the producers Gamble &amp; Huff signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972. With Gamble &amp; Huff, the O&#x27;Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with &quot;Back Stabbers&quot; (1972), and topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 the following year with &quot;Love Train&quot;. Several other US R&amp;B hits followed, and the O&#x27;Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013.

== History ==

The group was formed in Canton, Ohio, in 1958 while its members were attending Canton McKinley High School. Originally known as The Mascots, and then The Triumphs, the friends began recording with &quot;Miracles&quot; in 1961, which was a moderate hit in the Cleveland area. In 1963, they took the name &#x27;The O&#x27;Jays&#x27;, in tribute to Cleveland radio disc jockey Eddie O&#x27;Jay, who was part of the powerful management team of Frankie Crocker, Herb Hamlett, and O&#x27;Jay. In 1963, the group saw the release of their song &quot;Lonely Drifter,&quot; their first entry on the US &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single peaked at number 93. Their debut album, &quot;Comin&#x27; Through&quot;, was released shortly thereafter.

In the early 1960s, member Frank &quot;Frankie&quot; Little, Jr. joined the group as a guitarist and songwriter. He worked with lead vocalist Eddie Levert, assisting with some of the writing for the group, including 1964&#x27;s &quot;Do the Jerk&quot; (recorded by Frank Polk), 1964&#x27;s &quot;Oh, How You Hurt Me&quot; and 1966&#x27;s &quot;Pretty Words&quot;. He is also credited with vocals on 1962&#x27;s &quot;Down at the Corner.&quot; According to Walter Williams, &quot;Frankie was a guitarist and songwriter in the very early O’Jays. He came with us when we first ventured out of Cleveland and traveled to Los Angeles, but he also was in love with a woman in Cleveland that he missed so much that he soon returned back to Cleveland after a short amount of time.&quot; In 2021, human remains discovered in 1982 at Twinsburg, Ohio, were identified as those of Frankie Little.

Throughout the 1960s, the group continued to chart with minor hits such as &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; (which they performed nationally on the ABC television program &quot;Shivaree&quot;), &quot;Stand In for Love,&quot; &quot;Stand Tall,&quot; &quot;Let It All Out,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Sweeter Tomorrow,&quot; &quot;Look Over Your Shoulder,&quot; &quot;Deeper in Love with You,&quot; and &quot;One Night Affair.&quot; However, while they issued dozens of singles throughout the decade, they never hit the US top 40 (although &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; made it to number 19 in Canada). On the R&amp;B chart, the O&#x27;Jays were somewhat more prominent, but their only top 10 R&amp;B single prior to 1972 was 1968&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Sweeter Tomorrow.&quot;

In spite of their success as a touring group and on the R&amp;B chart, the group had been considering quitting the music industry in 1972. Around that time, original members Bill Isles and Bobby Massey departed, leaving the group a trio. The remaining three original members, Eddie Levert, William Powell, and Walter Williams, continued recording together, and Gamble &amp; Huff, a team of producers and songwriters with whom the O&#x27;Jays had been working for several years, signed them to their Philadelphia International label. Suddenly, the O&#x27;Jays released their first million-seller, &quot;Back Stabbers,&quot; from the album of the same name. This album produced several more hit singles, including &quot;992 Arguments,&quot; &quot;Sunshine,&quot; &quot;Time to Get Down,&quot; and the number 1 pop smash, &quot;Love Train.&quot;

During the remainder of the 1970s, the O&#x27;Jays continued releasing hit singles, including &quot;Put Your Hands Together&quot; (Pop number 10), &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; (Pop number 9), &quot;Give the People What They Want,&quot; &quot;Let Me Make Love to You,&quot; &quot;I Love Music&quot; (Pop number 5), &quot;Livin&#x27; for the Weekend,&quot; &quot;Message in Our Music,&quot; and &quot;Darlin&#x27; Darlin&#x27; Baby (Sweet Tender Love).&quot; Original member William Powell died of cancer in 1977 at age 35.

After adding Sammy Strain (of Little Anthony and the Imperials), the O&#x27;Jays continued recording, though with limited success. In 1978, the group released &quot;Use ta Be My Girl,&quot; which was their final top-five hit, though they continued placing songs on the R&amp;B charts throughout the 1980s. The O&#x27;Jays also saw some success in the United Kingdom, where they scored nine singles on the UK Singles Chart between 1972 and 1983, including four of which became major hits, reaching the top 20 on that chart. Their 1987 album, &quot;Let Me Touch You&quot;, included the number one R&amp;B hit &quot;Lovin&#x27; You.&quot; The O&#x27;Jays never again achieved pop success. In 1992, Sammy Strain left the group and returned to the Imperials. Later in the 1990s, the group did little recording.

On October 30, 2010, the group performed at Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert&#x27;s Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington, D.C. In Cleveland, Ohio, on August 17, 2013, the O&#x27;Jays were inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. The O&#x27;Jays are also two-time Grammy Hall of Fame Inductees for their songs &quot;Love Train&quot; (inducted 2006) and &quot;For the Love of Money&quot; (inducted 2016).

Bill Isles (born William Carvan Isles II in McAdenville, North Carolina) died on March 25, 2019, in Oceanside, California, at the age of 78.

<text>Francesca Isabella Simon (born 23 February 1955) is an American-born British author who resides in North London. She is most famous for writing the &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; and &quot;Evil Evie&quot; series of children&#x27;s books.

She is the daughter of screenwriter and playwright Mayo Simon (not to be confused with Simon Mayo, a British radio DJ).

==Biography==
Simon was born in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S. She grew up in California and studied at Yale and Jesus College, Oxford, where she majored in medieval studies and Old English. Simon worked as a journalist, writing for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; (US). She is married to an English husband, Martin Stamp, and has one son called Joshua (born 1989). Simon got the idea for the &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; books when a friend asked her to write a story about a horrid child. She also wanted to write about sibling rivalry and families where one child was considered &quot;perfect&quot; and the other &quot;horrid&quot;. Many of the &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; stories were inspired by events from Simon&#x27;s life, including her childhood, and those of people that she knew, with additional ideas coming from her imagination.

Simon was inspired to write by Anthony Trollope. She began to write children&#x27;s books full-time in 1989. Simon is one of the UK&#x27;s best-selling children&#x27;s writers; she has published over 50 different books, including her most popular series &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; series, which has sold over 25 million copies, and has been translated into 24 languages.

Simon lives in London with her husband, Martin. Their Tibetan spaniel, Shanti, is memorialised in the short story &quot;Shanti&quot; that Simon wrote for inclusion in the &quot;Paws and Whiskers&quot; anthology by fellow author Jacqueline Wilson published in February 2014.

In the spring of 2019 the Royal Opera House staged an opera based on Simon&#x27;s book &quot;The Monstrous Child&quot;, about the Norse god of the dead, Hel, as an angry teenager. The opera is composed by Gavin Higgins with libretto by Simon.

==Selected works==

* &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; series, illustrated by Tony Ross, Orion Books, 1994 to 2019
* 
* – longlisted for the Guardian Prize, 2014
* 

==Honours and awards==
In 2008, Simon won the British Book Award for British Book Award The Children&#x27;s Book of the Year with &quot;Horrid Henry and the Abominable Snowman&quot;. She is the first American to win this award.

Simon was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2023 New Year Honours for services to literature.

<text>Horrid Henry is a children&#x27;s book series by Francesca Simon and illustrated by Tony Ross. It has been adapted for television, film and theatre.

==Books==
The first &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; book was written and published in 1994 by Orion Books. Up until 2015, 24 official &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; titles were published in the series with a special one-off 25th Anniversary book, published in 2019. The series has sold more than 21 million copies worldwide.

The books are a slice-of-life series featuring the titular Henry, a wildly misbehaved boy who will typically be faced with a problem and then will often retaliate in interesting ways that involve trickery, rule-breaking and elaborate practical jokes. Henry has a younger brother, Perfect Peter, who is the exact opposite. Almost every character is known by an alliterative nickname (Rude Ralph, Moody Margaret, Brainy Brian, etc.) with a few exceptions e.g. Mum, Dad and Miss Battle-Axe. According to Francesca Simon, she got the idea for the &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; books when a friend asked her to write a story about a horrid child. She also wanted to write about sibling rivalry and families where one child was considered &quot;perfect&quot; and the other &quot;horrid&quot;. Many of the books&#x27; stories were inspired by events from Simon&#x27;s life and those of people that she knew, with additional ideas coming from her imagination. Inspiration also came from her own childhood, growing up in California the eldest of four, desperately wanting to be an only one. They lived in very small houses so there was, in Simon&#x27;s words, &quot;that feeling of all being squished together in not enough space, with my dad (Mayo Simon) writing away upstairs and telling us to be quiet&quot;.

The &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; stories are read on audiobook by actress Miranda Richardson and published by Orion Audio. Released between 2000 and 2019, the audiobooks were produced by Peter Rinne and Nicholas Jones (for Strathmore Publishing), with music composed by Rinne and Dik Cadbury.

Each title in the main series consists of four short stories with black and white illustrations. The titles in the &quot;Early Readers&quot; series, aimed at younger readers, each consist of a single story with colour illustrations. Each story in that series, except &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Horrid, Henry!&quot;, was originally published in a main series title. &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Horrid, Henry!&quot; is an original story about Henry as a toddler. Eleven fact books, written from Henry&#x27;s point of view, have also been published along with eight joke books, eleven colour books and at least twelve activity books as well as a series of annuals.

&quot;Horrid Henry&quot; is published in 25 languages around the world. In April 2009, the US Sourcebooks&#x27; Jabberwocky imprint released four &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; paperbacks nationwide, which included &quot;Horrid Henry&quot;, &quot;Horrid Henry&#x27;s Stinkbomb&quot;, &quot;Horrid Henry and the Mega-Mean Time Machine&quot;&quot; and &quot;Horrid Henry Tricks the Tooth Fairy&quot;. Sourcebooks has released additional &quot;Horrid Henry&quot; titles including activity pages, event kits and a teacher&#x27;s guide.

<text>The Stylistics are an American Philadelphia soul group that achieved their greatest chart success in the 1970s. They formed in 1968, with a lineup of singers Russell Thompkins Jr., Herb Murrell, Airrion Love, James Smith and James Dunn. All of their US hits were ballads characterized by the falsetto of Russell Thompkins Jr. and the production of Thom Bell. During the early 1970s, the group had twelve consecutive R&amp;B top ten hits, including &quot;Stop, Look, Listen&quot;, &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Break Up to Make Up&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;, which earned them 5 gold singles and 3 gold albums.

==Career==
===Early years===
The Stylistics were created from two Philadelphia groups, the Percussions and the Monarchs. The two bands were in the same high school. The Stylistics was first conceived when Airrion Love&#x27;s English teacher, Beverly Hamilton, suggested the two bands become one. Russell Thompkins Jr., James Smith and Airrion Love came from the Monarchs, and James Dunn and Herb Murrell came from the Percussions. The name &quot;the Stylistics&quot; came from their guitar player Robert Douglas.

Three original members, Airrion Love, James Dunn, and Russell Thompkins Jr., were born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Herb Murrell was born in Lane, South Carolina and James Smith was born in New York City, but moved to Philadelphia following his father&#x27;s death in 1962.

In 1970, the group recorded &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Girl Now&quot;, a song their road manager Marty Bryant co-wrote with Robert Douglas, a member of their backing band Slim and the Boys, and the single became a regional hit for Sebring Records. Producer Bill Perry spent $400 to record the song in the Virtue Studios in Philadelphia. The larger Avco Records soon signed the Stylistics, and the single eventually climbed to No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in early 1971.

===Success: The Bell/Creed years===
After signing to Avco, the record label approached producer Thom Bell, who had already produced a catalogue of hits for the Delfonics, to work with the group. The Stylistics auditioned for Bell, but he was initially unimpressed. He ultimately agreed to produce the group because he believed in the potential of lead singer Russell Thompkins, Jr.&#x27;s distinctive, nasal high tenor and falsetto voice. Avco gave Bell complete creative control over the Stylistics and he proceeded to focus the group&#x27;s sound exclusively around Thompkins&#x27;s voice. On most of the group hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo.

The first song recorded with Bell and his collaborator, lyricist Linda Creed, was &quot;Stop, Look, Listen&quot;.

Their hits from this period — distilled from three albums — included &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot; (U.S. No. 3), &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Break Up to Make Up&quot; (U.S. No. 5), &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; featuring Thompkins singing a lead vocal duet with Airrion Love, &quot;Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)&quot;, &quot;You Are Everything&quot; and the Top 20 pop chart hit &quot;Rockin&#x27; Roll Baby&quot; (U.S. No. 14). &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot;, the group&#x27;s biggest U.S. hit, holding at No. 2 for two weeks in 1974, was one of the group&#x27;s five U.S. gold singles.

The Stylistics also found a path on to adult contemporary airwaves, and the group made &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Easy Listening singles chart twelve times from 1971 to 1976, with three entries (&quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot;, &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)&quot;) reaching the Top 10. Every single that Bell produced for the Stylistics was a Top Ten R&amp;B hit, and several — &quot;You Are Everything&quot;, &quot;Betcha by Golly Wow!&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Stone in Love with You&quot;, &quot;Break Up to Make Up&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; — were also Top Ten pop chart hits. The group also enjoyed commercial success with hits with this material throughout Europe.

===Changing style: Continuing international success===
Thom Bell stopped working with the Stylistics in 1974, and the split proved commercially difficult for the group in the U.S. They struggled to find the right material, although their partnership with label owners Hugo &amp; Luigi as producers and arranger Van McCoy started well, with &quot;Let&#x27;s Put It All Together&quot; (No. 18 pop, No. 8 R&amp;B) and &quot;Heavy Fallin&#x27; Out&quot; (No. 4 R&amp;B, No. 41 pop). Later singles were notably less successful, but as U.S. success began to wane, their popularity in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, increased. Indeed, the lighter &#x27;pop&#x27; sound fashioned by McCoy and Hugo &amp; Luigi gave the group a U.K. No. 1 in 1975 with &quot;Can&#x27;t Give You Anything (But My Love)&quot;. Further successes with &quot;Sing Baby Sing&quot;, &quot;Na Na Is the Saddest Word&quot;, &quot;Funky Weekend&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Falling in Love&quot; consolidated the group&#x27;s European popularity. The Stylistics recorded &quot;Disco Baby&quot;, &quot;Love is the Answer&quot; and &quot;16 Bars&quot; also. They are one of the few U.S. acts to have two chart-topping greatest hits albums in the U.K.

The Stylistics switched record labels during this period as Avco Records transitioned into H&amp;L Records in 1976. Notwithstanding this, the band began to struggle with increasingly weak material, and although the singles and albums came out as before, by 1978 chart success had vanished; even a move to Mercury in 1978, for two albums produced by Teddy Randazzo, failed to produce any major success. Russell Thompkins Jr. wrote (in the sleevenotes for the re-issue of the 1976 album, &quot;Fabulous&quot;) that the group began to feel that the music they were recording was becoming dated, and not in keeping with the popular disco sound of the late 1970s.

In 1979, they had a small part in the movie &quot;Hair&quot;, directed by Miloš Forman, where they play conservative army officers. They double Nell Carter in singing a song called &quot;White Boys&quot;.

===Later years===

In 1980, the group reunited with Thom Bell and signed with Philadelphia International Records subsidiary, TSOP Records. They released the single &quot;Hurry Up This Way Again&quot; that year which brought them back into the R&amp;B Top 20 (peaking at No. 18). Both James Dunn and James Smith departed due to conflicts over the direction of the group; Dunn left before the recording of the album &quot;Hurry Up This Way Again&quot; (1980) and Smith after the recording of &quot;Closer Than Close&quot; in 1981. Nevertheless, the group continued, recruiting new member Raymond Johnson, but Johnson departed in 1985, leaving the group as a trio. Love, Murrell and Thompkins continued to tour until 2000, when Thompkins, Jr. left the group.

In 2000, singer Eban Brown (formerly of the Delfonics, the Manhattans, and Ray, Goodman and Brown) replaced Thompkins as lead singer. That same year, tenor singer Van Fields, who had previously sung with the A Cappella group &quot;A Perfect Blend&quot;, joined, enabling the Stylistics to grow from a trio back to a quartet. The group was featured live on the DVD &quot;The Stylistics Live at the Convocation Center&quot; (2006), as well as with other artists of the 1970s on the DVD, &quot;70s Soul Jam&quot;.

In 2004, after having left the Stylistics in 2000, former lead singer Thompkins launched his own group called Russell Thompkins Jr, &amp; the New Stylistics, returning with former member Johnson, plus James Ranton and Jonathan Buckson. They were featured on the DVD &quot;Old School Soul Party Live!,&quot; which was part of the PBS &quot;My Music&quot; series.

In 2010, they released an album entitled, &quot;That Same Way&quot; by LAC Management.

In 2011, Fields departed from the group after 11 years, due to creative differences, and was replaced by singer Jason Sharp.

In January 2018, after 18 years with the Stylistics, Brown, who is also a jazz guitarist and composer, announced his departure to concentrate on his solo career. He since performed at venues in the States and overseas as a solo artist. Brown was initially replaced by Michael Muse, and after a few months, he was replaced by former Temptation Barrington &quot;Bo&quot; Henderson.

In 2018, the Stylistics celebrated their 50th. anniversary in the music industry. Their milestone was acknowledged at venues throughout the year during their 50th. Anniversary tour in the States and overseas.

As of 2024, the remaining members of the original group, Love and Murrell (joined by newer member Jason Sharp) are still performing, continuing the Stylistics&#x27; legacy with their unit, while Thompkins and his New Stylistics continue to perform as well. James Smith and James Dunn are retired from singing.

Barrington &quot;Bo&quot; Henderson left the Stylistics in August 2024, and instead of replacing him, bass singer Jason Sharp moved to lead tenor vocals, making the group a trio for the first time since 2000.

On February 1, 2025 it was announced that The Stylistics will be inducted into The Atlantic City Walk of Fame on Monday, April 28, 2025. Recording artists Ray, Goodman &amp; Brown, Blue Magic, Jean Carne, and Phyllis Hyman are also being inducted.

<text>Aleatoricism (or aleatorism) is a term for musical compositions and other forms of art resulting from &quot;actions made by chance&quot;.

The term was first used &quot;in the context of electro-acoustics and information theory&quot; to describe &quot;a course of sound events that is determined in its framework and flexible in detail&quot;, by Belgian-German physicist, acoustician, and information theorist Werner Meyer-Eppler. In practical application, in compositions by Mozart and Kirnberger, for instance, the order of the measures of a musical piece were left to be determined by throwing dice, and in performances of music by Pousseur (e.g., &quot;Répons pour sept musiciens&quot;, 1960), musicians threw dice &quot;for sheets of music and cues&quot;. However, more generally in musical contexts, the term has had varying meanings as it was applied by various composers, and so a single, clear definition for aleatory music is defied. The term was popularised by the musical composer Pierre Boulez, but also Witold Lutosławski and Franco Evangelisti.

Its etymology derives from &quot;alea&quot;, Latin for &quot;dice&quot;, and it is the noun associated with the adjectival &quot;aleatory&quot; and &quot;aleatoric&quot;.

Aleatory should not be confused with either indeterminacy, or improvisation.

== Architecture ==
Sean Keller and Heinrich Jaeger coined the term &quot;aleatory architecture&quot; to describe &quot;a new approach that explicitly includes stochastic (re-) configuration of individual structural elements — that is to say &#x27;chance.&#x27;&quot;

==Art==

==Literature==
Charles Hartman discusses several methods of automatic generation of poetry in his book &quot;The Virtual Muse&quot;.

==Music==

The term aleatory was first coined by Werner Meyer-Eppler in 1955 to describe a course of sound events that is &quot;determined in general but depends on chance in detail&quot;. When his article was published in English, the translator mistakenly rendered his German noun &quot;Aleatorik&quot; as an adjective, and so inadvertently created a new English word, &quot;aleatoric&quot;. Pierre Boulez applied the term &quot;aleatory&quot; in this sense to his own pieces to distinguish them from the indeterminate music of John Cage. While Boulez purposefully composed his pieces to allow the performer certain liberties with regard to the sequencing and repetition of parts, Cage often composed through the application of chance operations without allowing the performer liberties.

Another composer of aleatory music was the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who had attended Meyer-Eppler&#x27;s seminars in phonetics, acoustics, and information theory at the University of Bonn from 1954 to 1956, and put these ideas into practice for the first time in his electronic composition &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; (1955–56), in the form of statistically structured, massed &quot;complexes&quot; of sounds.

Aleatoric techniques are sometimes used in contemporary film music, e.g., in John Williams&#x27;s film scores and Mark Snow&#x27;s music for &quot;X-Files: Fight the Future&quot;.

<text>Clive Chin (born 14 May 1954 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a Hakka Chinese Jamaican record producer whose work includes recordings by The Wailers, Dennis Brown, Lee Perry and Black Uhuru, among others. Chin was a pioneer in the establishment of dub as a standalone musical form. He is the eldest son of Vincent &quot;Randy&quot; Chin.

==Biography==

He began working at Randy&#x27;s Record Store, his father&#x27;s business, as a teenager, and helped make the associated studio, Randy&#x27;s Studio 17, one of the most important Jamaican studios of the early 1970s.

Chin&#x27;s first major commercial success was &quot;Java&quot;, an international hit by Augustus Pablo. He had further local hits with Dennis Brown&#x27;s &quot;Cheater&quot; and Junior Byles&#x27; &quot;King of Babylon&quot; and produced Pablo&#x27;s debut album, &quot;This Is Augustus Pablo&quot;. Chin produced the &quot;Java Java Dub&quot; album in 1973, which he claims was the first ever dub album. Further local hits followed with Carl Malcolm&#x27;s &quot;Miss Wire Waist&quot; and &quot;Fattie Bum Bum&quot;, which, with the help of Jonathan King, became a UK chart hit in 1975, reaching number 8.

After his family business moved to New York City, Chin spent some fifteen years running a Jamaican restaurant in Queens. He began producing again in 1998. In 2007, Chin started a VP Records imprint, 17 North Parade, to reissue some of the historic Randy&#x27;s releases.

<doc id="177254" wikidata="Q949271" url="?curid=177254" title="Eggs over Easy">
<text>Eggs over Easy were an American country rock band, of the early 1970s, who visited London to record an album, and then became a resident band in a London pub, launching what subsequently became known as pub rock.

==Formation==
Although both hailed from New York City, Jack O&#x27;Hara (guitar, bass &amp; vocals) met Austin de Lone (keyboards, guitar &amp; vocals) in Berkeley, California, where they formed a duo. The pair moved back to New York, where they met Brien Hopkins (keyboards, bass, guitar &amp; vocals) who joined to form a multi-instrumental trio, without a drummer or percussionist. They regularly played clubs and bars in Greenwich Village and Long Island, until they acquired a small fan base, and a manager, Peter Kauff. Kauff was also helping Cannon Films to move into the music business, and arranged for Chas Chandler (bass player for the Animals and producer/manager of the Jimi Hendrix Experience) to produce their first album.

==London==
Recording started at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London, in December 1970, initially with Les Sampson (a friend of Noel Redding who joined him in the band Road) on drums. They also played several dates at the American Embassy as a trio. Recording was completed in January 1971, with ex-Animal John Steel on drums. The recordings went well, but Kauff fell out with Cannon Films, and advised the band to stay in London, until the problems were resolved, rather than return to the US.

Chandler, by now their manager, arranged for the band to play a number of college gigs around the country. Many of these were sponsored by the American Embassy in London, which paid for the band to tour British universities to perform before larger audiences with American poets such as Marilyn Hacker, Denis Boyles and Louis Simpson. By then, the band had moved into a house, 10 Alma Street, Kentish Town, near a pub called the Tally Ho. The band were used to playing in American bars, but in common with most London pubs at the time, the Tally Ho had a jazz-only policy. They persuaded the landlord that they played jazz, although their music was predominantly country rock and blues, and first appeared on either 3 May, or 13 May 1971, with Steel on drums. They soon attracted large crowds - including other musicians, such as Graham Parker, Nick Lowe and Elvis Costello - making Eggs the pioneers of the &quot;pub rock&quot; movement. Eventually, they were asked to increase their performances, until they were playing three nights and Sunday lunchtime each week. On other days they often appeared at other venues, such as The Marquee, which is where Dave Robinson, Brinsley Schwarz&#x27;s manager, had seen them and introduced them to the band.

Eggs over Easy had a large repertoire of over 50 of their own songs, and 50 covers, and were regularly joined on stage by members of Brinsley Schwarz and other performers, such as Loudon Wainwright III and Frankie Miller. One of the former Tally Ho jazz players, Barry Richardson, was so impressed he formed Bees Make Honey, who were also given a Tally Ho residency, alongside a mix of new and existing bands, such as Max Merritt and the Meteors and Brinsley Schwarz.

The number of venues wanting to stage Eggs Over Easy and other &quot;pub-rock&quot; bands was also increasing, primarily in large Victorian pubs &quot;north of Regents Park&quot; where there were plenty of suitable pubs. Eggs over Easy toured a chain of London pubs owned by the brewer Ind Coope, and in September and October 1971 supported John Mayall on a UK tour, with George Butler replacing Steel on drums; &quot;Eggs over Easy&#x27;s country rock-flavored repertoire offering a fascinating counterpoint to Mayall&#x27;s then rampant jazz-blues fixation&quot; (Dave Thompson).

Kauff had not managed to resolve the dispute with Cannon Films, so the album remained unreleased, and the band had not secured a contract with a UK record label either. As they were having visa problems, Kauff suggested that they return home, so on 7 November 1971 they played their last gig at the Tally Ho, and went back to the US.

==Return to US==
Back in New York, Bill Franz joined on drums, they signed a deal with A&amp;M Records and in 1972 they recorded their first album to be released, &quot;Good &#x27;N&#x27; Cheap&quot;. This was partially a re-recording of the tracks originally recorded in London. The album was produced by Link Wray, at his brother, Vernon Wray’s studio in Tucson, Arizona, and the band wrote all but one of the songs.

In 1973, they moved to San Francisco, and later supported Eagles and Yes on tour, the sort of &quot;megastar&quot; bands that, back in England, pub rock was seen as a backlash against. By 1976 John &quot;Jay&quot; David (ex Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show) had replaced Franz on drums, and they issued a single &quot;Bar in my Car&quot;, on Buffalo Records, but the record company &quot;tanked as soon as the record came out.&quot; Originally titled &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Put a Bar in the Back of My Car (And Drive Myself to Drink)&quot;, the song appears on numerous internet lists of &quot;worst country song titles&quot; as being from their album &quot;Fear of Frying&quot;, but this is incorrect.

The second album &quot;Fear of Frying&quot; was eventually recorded in 1980/81 and issued on Squish Records, which also failed as soon as the album was released, making this album a rarity, which has yet to be re-issued on CD.

The Eggs were frequently joined on stage by Grootna&#x27;s vocalist Anna Rizzo and also played with members of Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen in Moonlighters. One of their final gigs was as &quot;The Opinions&quot;, backing Dan Hicks; Eggs Over Easy finally split in 1981.

After the break-up, Hopkins continued as a songwriter, O’Hara became a recording engineer and de Lone played as a session musician with Bonnie Raitt, Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello and others.

<text>RCA Records is an American record label. Since 2008, it has been owned by Sony Music Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation.

RCA Records is one of Sony Music&#x27;s four flagship labels, alongside RCA&#x27;s former long-time rival Columbia Records; also Arista Records, and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, classical, rock, hip hop, afrobeat, electronic, R&amp;B, blues, jazz, and country. The label&#x27;s name is derived from the initials of its now defunct parent company, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA).

RCA Records was fully acquired by Bertelsmann in 1987, making it a part of Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) and became a part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment after the 2004 merger of BMG and Sony; it was acquired by the latter in 2008, after the dissolution of Sony/BMG and the restructuring of Sony Music.

RCA Records is the corporate successor of the Victor Talking Machine Company.

Its roster includes SZA, Britney Spears, Shakira, Chris Brown, Justin Timberlake, Childish Gambino, Pink, Doja Cat, H.E.R., ASAP Rocky, Foo Fighters, Young Nudy, Normani, Khalid, Becky G, Chance the Rapper, Wolf Alice, D&#x27;Angelo, Wizkid, G-Eazy, Elle King, Ferg, Nardo Wick, Bryson Tiller, Jazmine Sullivan, YNW BSlime, Amy Shark, Ateez, Lucky Daye, Kane Brown, Teezo Touchdown, Jade, Tool, Sleepy Hallow, Latto, Skillibeng, Isabel LaRosa, Lisa, Rex Orange County, Yebba, Kygo, The Strokes, Kirk Franklin, Steve Lacy, Alex G, Tate McRae, Tems, Victoria Monét, Davido, Mark Ronson, Pentatonix, Kaytranada, Lizzy McAlpine, Skepta, Cage the Elephant, Miguel, Grizzly Bear, Cam, Nao, Blood Orange, Flo Milli, Kevin Abstract, Kenny Mason, and Fousheé, among others.

== Beginnings and history==


In 1929, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company, then the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of phonographs (including the famous &quot;Victrola&quot;) and phonograph records. The company then became the RCA Victor Division of RCA. In absorbing Victor, RCA acquired the New World rights to the famous Nipper/&quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark.
In 1931, RCA Victor&#x27;s British affiliate the Gramophone Company merged with the Columbia Graphophone Company to form EMI. This gave RCA head David Sarnoff a seat on the EMI board.

In September 1931, RCA Victor introduced the first 33 rpm records sold to the public, calling them &quot;Program Transcription&quot; records. These used a shallower and more closely spaced implementation of the large &quot;standard groove&quot; found on contemporary 78 rpm records, rather than the &quot;microgroove&quot; used for post-World War II 33 rpm &quot;LP&quot; (long play) records. The format was a commercial failure, partly because the new Victrolas with two-speed turntables designed to play these records were exorbitantly priced, the least expensive model retailing for $395.00 in the depths of the Great Depression. By 1933, the format was abandoned and two-speed turntables were no longer offered, but some Program Transcriptions lingered in the Victor record catalog until the end of the 1930s.

During the early days of the Depression, RCA Victor made a number of attempts to create a successful low-priced label to compete with &quot;dime store labels&quot; such as Perfect, Oriole, Banner, and Melotone. The first was the short-lived Timely Tunes label in 1931, sold exclusively by Montgomery Ward. Bluebird Records was created in 1932 as a sub-label of Victor. It was originally an 8-inch record with a dark blue label, alongside the 8-inch Electradisk label (sold by F.W. Woolworth). Neither label was a success. In 1933, RCA Victor reintroduced Bluebird and Electradisk as a standard 10-inch label (Bluebird&#x27;s label was redesigned, and it became known as the &#x27;buff&#x27; label). Another discount label, Sunrise, was produced (although it is not known for whom it was produced, as Sunrise records are exceptionally rare today). The same musical couplings were issued on all three labels and the Bluebird label is still in existence today, nine decades after Electradisk and Sunrise were discontinued.

During this time, RCA Victor also produced electrical transcriptions of music under the RCA Thesaurus label at its RCA Recorded Program Services studio in New York City. These recordings were not offered for sale to the general public and were intended solely for use in broadcasts carried over leading radio networks. By 1936, RCA&#x27;s extensive musical library of recordings was eventually consolidated with NBC&#x27;s own transcription division. During the 1950s, it included popular music by noted musicians, such as Sammy Kaye, Freddie Martin, Lawrence Welk and John Serry Sr.

=== RCA Victor Custom Record Division ===
Besides manufacturing its own records, RCA&#x27;s Custom Record Division was the leading record manufacturer for independent labels. RCA&#x27;s Midwestern plant in Indianapolis, at 501 North LaSalle Street (the site is now part of a Demolition and Blight Reduction Project). The Custom Division notably pressed many record compilations for The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association.

=== EMI ===
RCA sold its interest in EMI in 1938, but EMI (now Universal Music Group) continued to distribute RCA Victor recordings in the UK and its territories on the His Master&#x27;s Voice label until 1957. RCA also manufactured and distributed HMV recordings on the RCA Victor and special HMV labels in North America.

=== World War II era ===
Due to hostilities between Japan and the United States during World War II, ties between RCA Victor and its Japanese subsidiary Victor Company of Japan (Nippon Victor) were severed. JVC&#x27;s record company is known today as Victor Entertainment and still retains the Nipper/His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark for use in Japan.

From 1942 to 1944, RCA Victor was seriously impacted by the American Federation of Musicians recording ban. Virtually all union musicians in the US and Canada were forbidden from making recordings during the period. One of the few exceptions was the eventual release of recorded radio broadcast performances from the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini. However, RCA Victor lost the Philadelphia Orchestra during this period; the orchestra&#x27;s contract with RCA Victor expired during the strike and when Columbia Records settled with the union before RCA Victor, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphians signed a new contract with Columbia and began recording in 1944. Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra would not return to RCA until 1968.

=== The post-war 1940s ===
In the spring of 1946, &quot;RCA Victor&quot; replaced &quot;Victor&quot; on its record labels. In 1949, RCA Victor introduced the 7-inch 45 rpm micro-grooved vinylite record, marketed simply as the &quot;45&quot;. The new format, which had been under development for over a decade, was originally intended to replace 78 rpm discs. By the time RCA Victor unveiled it, the 45 was now competing with the 10-inch and 12-inch 33 rpm microgroove vinyl &quot;LP&quot; (Long Play) discs introduced by arch-rival Columbia Records in the early summer of 1948. In heavy promotion, RCA Victor sold compact, inexpensive add-on and stand-alone units that played the 45 rpm format exclusively. At first, RCA Victor&#x27;s 45s were issued on colored vinyl according to the musical genre: contemporary pop music on black vinyl (47-xxxx series), prestigious Broadway musicals and operettas on &quot;midnight blue&quot; vinyl (52-xxxx series), classical music on red vinyl (49-xxxx series), country and polka on green (48-xxxx series), children&#x27;s fare on yellow (also in the 47-xxxx series), rhythm and blues on orange or cerise (50-xxxx series), and international on light blue (51-xxxx series). This array of colors complicated the production process, and the practice was soon discontinued, all records becoming black. Yellow and red Red Seal records held on until about 1952. The first 45 rpm record manufactured was &quot;PeeWee the Piccolo&quot; RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed December 7, 1948 at the Sherman Drive plant in Indianapolis. The use of vinyl, which was much more expensive than the gritty shellac compound normally used for 78s, was actually cheaper because of the smaller diameter and greatly reduced bulk of the new records, which required very little raw material. The smaller, lightweight discs were also more economical to store and ship.

RCA Victor marketed the 45 as a direct replacement for 10-inch and 12-inch 78 rpm records, which typically played for about three and four minutes per side respectively. The company also released some &quot;extended play&quot; (EP) 45s with playing times up to 7 minutes per side, primarily for vocal collections and light classical selections, as typified by an Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra disc featuring Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Marche Slave&quot; and Ketèlbey&#x27;s &quot;In a Persian Market&quot;. RCA Victor issued boxed sets of four to six 45s, each set providing about the same amount of music as one LP (an extreme example of these 45 rpm boxed sets was the complete 1951 recording of the opera &quot;Carmen&quot;, featuring Risë Stevens and Jan Peerce, conducted by Fritz Reiner, which consisted of sixteen 45 rpm discs). In the case of operas, symphonies and other complete recordings of classical music, there was an interruption every four minutes as one record side ended and another side began. These disruptive &quot;side breaks&quot;, a nuisance long familiar to listeners of album sets of classical and operatic 78 rpm records, were minimized by an extremely fast automatic record-changing mechanism that was a core feature of RCA Victor&#x27;s 45 players. Thanks in large degree to RCA Victor&#x27;s massive five million dollar advertising campaign, the 45 became the preferred speed for pop music singles, overtaking U.S. sales of the same material on 78s by 1954, but Columbia&#x27;s LP prevailed as the favored format for classical music and convenient one-disc &quot;album&quot; collections of eight or more pop songs. RCA Victor finally bowed to the inevitable and announced its intention to issue LPs in January, 1950.

=== 1950s ===
Among the first RCA Victor LPs released in 1950 was &quot;Gaîté Parisienne&quot; by Jacques Offenbach, performed by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra, which had been recorded in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall on June 20, 1947; the record was given the catalogue number LM-1001. Non-classical LP record albums were issued with the prefix &quot;LPM&quot;. When RCA Victor began issuing classical LPs in stereophonic sound in 1958, the prefix &quot;LSC&quot; was used. Non-classical stereo LPs were issued with the prefix &quot;LSP&quot;. RCA utilized these catalog prefixes until 1973, when they were changed to &quot;ARL1&quot; and &quot;APL1&quot; for stereo classical and stereo non-classical single LPs, respectively.

During the 1950s, RCA Victor had three subsidiary or specialty labels: Groove, Vik and &quot;X&quot;.

The edition of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine dated April 11, 1953, announced a new RCA Victor subsidiary label, its first to use independent distribution and was nameless when it was first revealed. For the lack of any better designation, Billboard chose to refer to the new, unnamed label in the story as Label &quot;X&quot;; the new label began to hire staffers and decide on a direction, and the name stuck until 1955. RCA Victor officially announced the formation of label &quot;X&quot; on April 20, 1953. Groove was an R&amp;B specialty label founded in 1954 and folded into Vik in 1957; the Vik label was discontinued the following year.

From the label&#x27;s beginnings in 1902, and intensifying through the 1940s and 1950s, RCA Victor was in direct competition with Columbia Records. A number of recordings were made with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini; sometimes RCA Victor utilized recordings of broadcast concerts (Toscanini had been recording for the label since the days of acoustic recordings, and RCA Victor had been recording the NBC Symphony since its creation in 1937). After Toscanini retired in the spring of 1954, the NBC Symphony was reorganized later that year as the Symphony of the Air. The orchestra, while no longer connected to NBC, continued to record for RCA Victor, as well as other labels, usually conducted by Leopold Stokowski. RCA Victor also released a number of recordings with the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra, which was usually drawn from either Philadelphia or New York musicians, as well as members of the Symphony of the Air, and the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera. By the late 1950s, RCA Victor had fewer high prestige orchestras under contract than Columbia had: RCA Victor recorded the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Boston Pops, whereas Columbia had the Cleveland Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under contracts.

On October 6, 1953, RCA Victor held experimental stereophonic sessions in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan Center with Leopold Stokowski conducting a group of New York City musicians in performances of George Enescu&#x27;s &quot;Roumanian Rhapsody No. 1&quot; and the waltz from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;. There were additional stereo tests in December, again in the Manhattan Center, this time with Pierre Monteux conducting members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In February 1954, RCA Victor made its first commercial stereophonic recordings, taping the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Charles Münch, in a performance of &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; by Hector Berlioz. This began a practice of simultaneously recording orchestras with both stereophonic and monaural equipment. Other early stereo recordings were made of Toscanini&#x27;s final NBC concerts (never officially issued) and Guido Cantelli respectively, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra; the Boston Pops Orchestra under Arthur Fiedler; and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner. Initially, RCA used RT-21 quarter-inch tape recorders (which ran at 30 inches per second), wired to mono mixers, with Neumann U-47 cardioid and M-49/50 omnidirectional microphones. Then they switched to an Ampex 300–3 one-half inch machine, running at 15 inches per second (which was later increased to 30 inches per second). These recordings were initially issued in 1955 on special stereophonic reel-to-reel tapes and then, beginning in 1958, on vinyl LPs with the &quot;Living Stereo&quot; logo. RCA has continued to reissue many of these &quot;Living Stereo&quot; recordings on CD. Another 1953 project for RCA was converting the acoustically superior building Webster Hall into its main East Coast recording studio. RCA Victor operated this studio venue from 1953 to 1968.

In September 1954, RCA Victor introduced &quot;Gruve-Gard&quot; where the center and edge of a record are thicker
than the playing area, reducing scuff marks during handling and when stacked on a turntable with an automatic record changer. Most competitors quickly adopted the raised label and edges.

In 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of Elvis Presley from Sun Records for the then-exorbitant sum of $40,000. His first single for RCA Victor was &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, recorded in January 1956. Ten million Presley singles were sold by the label during 1956; Presley went on to become RCA Victor&#x27;s biggest selling artist.

Effective in 1957, EMI/HMV ended its 55-year association with RCA Victor, after EMI&#x27;s acquisition of Capitol Records in 1955. Capitol then became the main distributor for EMI recordings in the Americas; Decca Records became the manufacturer and distributor for RCA Victor in the United Kingdom, using the RCA lightning bolt logo, instead of the Nipper/His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark for which EMI held the rights to in the U.K. and Europe.
RCA set up its own British manufacturing and distribution in 1969.

RCA Victor issued several spoken word albums in the 1950s and 60s, notably the soundtracks of the films &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, as well as complete versions of the National Theatre of Great Britain stage productions of &quot;Othello&quot; (starring Laurence Olivier) and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (starring Maggie Smith, who also played Desdemona in the Olivier &quot;Othello&quot;). None of these albums have appeared on compact disc, but the films of &quot;Richard III&quot;, &quot;A Man For All Seasons&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and the filmed version of Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; have all been issued on DVD.

=== 1960s ===
In 1960, RCA Victor announced the Compact 33 double extended play and singles; these were 7 inch records, which played at 33 1/3 rpm. In January 1961, the Compact 33 discs were released simultaneously with their 45 rpm counterparts. The long-term goal was to phase out the 45 rpm disc, but sales of the new records were poor and by early 1962 the campaign had failed.

In 1963, RCA Victor introduced Dynagroove which added computer technology to the disc cutting process, ostensibly to improve sound reproduction. Whether or not the complex process was actually an improvement is still debated among audiophiles. RCA quietly phased out the Dynagroove process by 1970.

In September 1965, RCA and Lear Jet Corp. teamed up to release the first stereo 8-track tape music Cartridges (Stereo 8) which were first used in the 1966 line of Ford automobiles and were popular throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. (The initial release comprised 175 titles from RCA Victor and RCA Camden&#x27;s catalog of artists.)

In late 1968, the Radio Corporation of America, wishing to modernize its image, introduced what was then a futuristic-looking new logo (the letters &#x27;RCA&#x27; in block, modernized form), replacing the original lightning bolt logo, and the virtual retirement of both the Victor and Nipper/His Master&#x27;s Voice trademarks. The Radio Corporation of America officially changed its name to the RCA Corporation; the RCA Victor Division was now known as RCA Records. The &#x27;Victor&#x27; trademark was restricted to the labels and album covers of RCA&#x27;s regular popular record releases. RCA Victor record labels were changed to bright orange or yellow (becoming tan briefly late in 1975–76), replacing the traditional black label color in use since 1901. The Nipper/His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark was seen only on the album covers of RCA Red Seal Records.

RCA Records introduced a thin, pliable, lightweight vinyl LP record known as Dynaflex in late 1969. This very thin, flexible record claimed to overcome warping and other problems encountered with conventional thicker LP records and like Dynagroove, it soon developed a similarly controversial reputation, derided by some record collectors as &quot;Dynawarp&quot;. RCA gradually phased out Dynaflex records and by the end of the 1970s had returned to manufacturing thicker vinyl records.

=== 1970s ===

In April 1970, RCA Records announced the first quadraphonic 4-channel 8-track tape cartridges (&quot;Quad-8&quot;, later called just Q8). RCA began releasing quadraphonic vinyl recordings in the United States in February 1973, in the CD-4 format developed by its former subsidiary, the Victor Company of Japan (JVC), and made commercially practical by Quadracast Systems Inc. (QSI). RCA&#x27;s trade name became &quot;Quadradisc&quot;. The CD-4 format required a special cartridge that had a ±1 db frequency response out to 50 kHz, a CD-4 demodulator which decoded the difference between the front and rear channels from a 30 kHz subcarrier, four separate amplifier channels, and four separate speakers for the left and right front and left and right rear. Both the CD-4 Quadradisc and Quad-8 tape cartridge systems were true discrete 4–4–4 quadraphonic systems. Columbia Records introduced a quadraphonic matrix system, SQ, which required a decoder, 4-channel amplifier and the four speakers. The SQ system was referred to as a 4–2–4 matrix system. The Warner Music Group labels also adopted Quadradisc, but the format never became popular, and both RCA and CBS/Columbia abandoned quadraphonic recording in 1976; some of the RCA sessions were later remastered for Dolby encoding (same as Peter Scheiber&#x27;s original matrix system) and released on
compact disc This included Charles Gerhardt&#x27;s acclaimed series of RCA Red Seal albums devoted to classic film scores by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Alfred Newman, Dimitri Tiomkin, Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, and others, performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded in London&#x27;s Kingsway Hall.

In order to publish music in Japan, RCA collaborated with the Victor Company of Japan&#x27;s publishing wing Victor Musical Industries Inc. in 1975 to found Japanese record label RVC.

In October 1976, the RCA Corporation announced the revival of the Nipper/His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark. RCA Records reinstated Nipper to most (Victor, Victrola, Red Seal and Special Products) record labels (in addition to returning to the traditional black label color for popular releases) in countries where RCA held the rights to the Nipper/His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark. Nipper was once again widely used in RCA newspaper and magazine advertisements and sales literature, as well as store displays and promotional items such as T-shirts caps, posters, coin banks, keychains, watches, coffee mugs and stuffed toys. The trademark was also restored to RCA stationery, shipping cartons and company vehicles.

=== 1980s ===
In 1983, Arista Records owner Bertelsmann sold 50% of Arista to RCA. In 1985, Bertelsmann and RCA Records formed a joint venture called RCA/Ariola International. In December 1985, the RCA Corporation was purchased by General Electric (GE), with the acquisition completed in June, 1986. GE sold its 50% interest in RCA Records to its partner Bertelsmann and the company was renamed BMG Music for Bertelsmann Music Group. BMG revived the RCA &quot;lightning bolt&quot; logo that was retired in 1968 to differentiate RCA Records from the other RCA divisions, which GE either liquidated, sold, or closed. BMG also revived the &quot;RCA Victor&quot; label for Red Seal, Broadway and soundtrack releases and other musical genres outside of rock, pop and country music. In 1986, Bob Buziak, formerly an artist manager, was appointed president of the label.

During the mid-1980s, RCA Records operated at a deficit, due in part to &quot;overpriced deals&quot; with pop stars including Kenny Rogers and Diana Ross. In 1986, the label bought back $25 million in unsold albums and lost $35 million during the fiscal year 1987. As a partial corrective, a decentralized style of management which allowed RCA Records to function as a free-standing entrepreneurial business was implemented for 1988. Buziak drastically cut the RCA roster from around 40 artists to 11, and began to rebuild it with a focus on developing new artists, including artists acquired through marketing and distribution agreements with Beggars Banquet Records, a British punk rock label, and Jive Records, whose roster included Schooly D, Kool Moe Dee, and DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince.

By the end of the fiscal year 1988, RCA Records had gross revenue of $236 million in the United States, the most profitable year in the label&#x27;s history. The album &quot;The Way It Is&quot; by Bruce Hornsby and the Range, sold more than three million copies, and the soundtrack album from the film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, which cost RCA $200,000 to produce, sold 15.6 million copies in less than two years. Its follow-up, &quot;More Dirty Dancing&quot;, composed of song tracks which had been left off of the first album, was produced for $80,000 and went on to sell more than 5.6 million. RCA&#x27;s most successful artists during the 1980s included the Eurythmics, Love and Rockets, Joshua Perahia, Rick Astley, Hall &amp; Oates, Dolly Parton, Juice Newton, and Bucks Fizz.

=== 1990s ===
In August 1990, Buziak was replaced by Joe Galante, who had been the president of RCA Records Nashville division. The roster was cut once again and the A&amp;R department was restructured. Along with the launch of BNA Records and the expansion of the urban music division, these initiatives would prove to be positive, but RCA was unsuccessful under Galante, ranking 10th in market share in 1995. Galante returned to head the RCA Nashville division and in March, 1995 was replaced by Bob Jamieson, the president of RCA&#x27;s Canadian division. Jamieson overhauled RCA, streamlining middle management and retooling the label&#x27;s marketing department. The A&amp;R department was again restructured and the roster of artists further reduced.

By the close of the decade, RCA Records had undergone what &quot;Billboard&quot; described as a &quot;remarkable turnaround&quot; with the success of artists including Britney Spears, the Dave Matthews Band, Natalie Imbruglia, the Verve Pipe, Robyn, SWV, Christina Aguilera, NSYNC, and Foo Fighters. A distribution deal with Loud Records yielded hit records from urban artists including Big Punisher, Wu-Tang Clan and Mobb Deep.

=== 2000s ===
In 2002, BMG fully acquired J Records, which it had founded in 2000 as a joint venture with Clive Davis. Davis was then named chairman of RCA Records and J Records under the auspices of a new entity, the RCA Music Group, which included RCA Records, J, and Arista Records. In 2004, Sony and BMG merged their music divisions to create Sony BMG, and in 2007, the RCA Music Group was rebranded as the BMG Label Group. In 2006, Sony BMG merged its former Broadway music and classical labels, including Red Seal and Gold Seal, to Sony Masterworks. Legacy Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s catalog division, reissued classic albums from RCA.

In April 2008, former Zomba Label Group president and CEO Barry Weiss was appointed chairman of the BMG Label Group, and Davis was named chief creative officer of Sony BMG worldwide. In October, Sony acquired BMG&#x27;s 50% ownership and the BMG Label Group was merged with the Jive Label Group to establish the RCA/Jive Label Group. It included RCA, Jive, J, Arista, Polo Grounds, LaFace Records, Volcano Entertainment, Hitz Committee, Battery Records, and the Verity Gospel Music Group.

The decade marked a period during which RCA Records had notable success in the pop genre, with Christina Aguilera, Kesha, Pink, Kelly Clarkson and Pitbull scoring multiple #1 hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts.

=== 2010s ===
In May 2011, former Universal Music Group CEO Doug Morris was appointed chairman of Sony Music Entertainment. Focused on A&amp;R, Morris named Peter Edge, president of A&amp;R at RCA and J Records, chairman and CEO of RCA Music Group. Tom Corson was named president and COO. On the seventh of October of that year, the Jive, Arista and J imprints were altogether permanently merged into RCA. As a result, the RCA Music Group was then disbanded and RCA was reinstated as a standalone label under the Sony Music umbrella. Following the shutdown of the three labels, a majority of various artists from the rosters of Jive, Arista and/or J were shifted to release future material under RCA.

During the first half of the decade, RCA released platinum and multi-platinum records by artists including A$AP Rocky, Cage the Elephant, Chris Brown, Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, D&#x27;Angelo, Dave Matthews Band, Foo Fighters, G-Eazy, Jennifer Hudson, R. Kelly, Kesha, Khalid, Alicia Keys, Kings of Leon, Miguel, Pentatonix, P!nk, Pitbull, Shakira, Sia, Britney Spears, Bryson Tiller, Justin Timberlake, T-Pain, and Tinashe.

John Fleckenstein and Joe Riccitelli were appointed as co-presidents of RCA Records in January 2018. Later that year, RCA named Keith Naftaly president of A&amp;R, and Tunji Balogun executive VP of A&amp;R.

=== 2020s ===
In addition to releasing successful albums by Bryson Tiller, Alicia Keys, Fousheé&#x27; and Pentatonix in 2020, RCA had #1 records with Doja Cat&#x27;s &quot;Say So&quot; feat. Nicki Minaj; Miley Cyrus&#x27; &quot;Plastic Hearts&quot; and Chris Brown &amp; Young Thug&#x27;s &quot;Go Crazy&quot;. Brockhampton&#x27;s single &quot;Sugar&quot; was certified platinum, and singles by Flo Milli and Latto (formerly known as &quot;Mulatto&quot;) were certified gold. Both Doja Cat and Kaytranada received multiple Grammy nominations, including Best New Artist, H.E.R. received her 13th Grammy nomination, and the Strokes album &quot;The New Abnormal&quot; won for Best Rock Album. Koffee signed with RCA just after she became the first woman and the youngest person to win the Reggae Album of the Year Grammy. In June 2020, the label partnered with the Human Rights Campaign to present the 2020 Pride Benefit Concert, a livestream supporting LGBTQ equality in June. RCA artists including Isaac Dunbar, Cam, and Citizen Queen performed. SZA released the single &quot;Good Days&quot; on December 25.

In January 2021, Mark Pitts was appointed president of RCA Records and John Fleckenstein was named chief operating officer. Jazmine Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Heaux Tales&quot; hit #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B albums chart.

She was #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; emerging artist chart. In April 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that the label had signed Thai rapper Lisa, a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, for her venture into American solo endeavors.

==Broadway and Hollywood==
RCA Victor has produced several notable Broadway cast albums, among them the original Broadway recordings of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, &quot;Paint Your Wagon&quot;, the Mary Martin &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. RCA has also recorded and released recordings of revival stagings of musicals. These include the musical productions staged at Lincoln Center, such as the 1966 revivals of &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, the 1987 revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot; and the 1998 Broadway revivals of &quot;Cabaret&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. &quot;Call Me Madam&quot; was recorded by RCA Victor with all of its original cast except for its star Ethel Merman, who, due to contractual obligations, could not be released from her American Decca Records contract. She was replaced on the RCA Victor album by Dinah Shore. RCA Victor was also responsible for the film soundtrack albums of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, &quot;South Pacific&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot;, and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. The album made from the 1965 hit Julie Andrews film was (and is) one of the best selling soundtracks of all time. The film soundtrack of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, made by Colgems Records, was distributed by RCA, which had released the Broadway cast album. RCA Victor also released the original American cast album of &quot;Hair&quot;.

Similarly, RCA Victor also made several studio cast recording albums, including a Lerner and Loewe series with Jan Peerce, Jane Powell, and Robert Merrill, as well as a 1963 album of excerpts from George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, with its 1952 revival leads, Leontyne Price and William Warfield, but a different supporting cast. They also issued two studio cast versions of &quot;Show Boat&quot;, one with Robert Merrill, Patrice Munsel, and Rise Stevens in 1956, and the other with Howard Keel, Anne Jeffreys, and Gogi Grant in 1958. Contrary to the way the show is written, both of these &quot;Show Boat&quot; albums featured all-white casts, reflecting the era of racial segregation.

In 2006, Sony BMG merged its Broadway music labels, including RCA Victor, to the new Masterworks Broadway Records. All of these recordings are now on Masterworks Broadway Records, which has remastered and reissued many of these albums.

== Recording studios ==
Victor&#x27;s early recording studios were established in Philadelphia in 1901 and then at its headquarters in Camden, New Jersey and also in New York. In 1917, Victor acquired the abandoned Trinity Church located at 114 North 5th Street in Camden and used it as a recording studio until 1935. Beginning in 1928, Victor built a new recording studio in New York City and in the 1950s and &#x27;60s RCA Victor built and operated recording studio facilities in Nashville, Hollywood, and Chicago. In 1977, RCA closed the studios in Nashville and Hollywood; the remaining New York City recording studios were closed in 1993.

===East 24th Street, New York===

In 1928, the Victor Talking Machine Company built a recording studio at 155 East 24th Street in Manhattan, which became RCA Victor Studios following the Radio Corporation of America&#x27;s purchase of the Victor Company in 1929. Operational from 1928 to 1969, the studio was the site of numerous notable recordings by such artists as Glenn Miller and His Orchestra, Eddie Fisher, Elvis Presley, The Isley Brothers, Charles Mingus, Perry Como, Harry Belafonte, Lena Horne, Della Reese, and Neil Sedaka. In 1969, the building was sold to the City College of New York, which occupied it until 1998, after which the building was razed to facilitate construction of the Baruch College Newman Vertical Campus.

===1133 Avenue of the Americas, New York===

In 1969, RCA consolidated its New York City corporate offices and opened new recording studios within a new building located at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, closing the East 24th Street studios it had operated for over 40 years. RCA&#x27;s Sixth Avenue Studios consisted of five recording studios, including Studio A, a 60 x 100 foot room with 30-foot ceiling, nine tape mastering rooms and five lacquer mastering channels. These facilities were often used for classical projects and numerous original Broadway cast recordings of shows. RCA closed its Sixth Avenue Studios in 1993, with the space later becoming offices.

===RCA Studio B, Nashville===

In 1956, Steve Sholes and Chet Atkins established RCA Victor&#x27;s first Nashville recording studio at 1611 Hawkins Street (later renamed Roy Acuff Place) in what would become Nashville&#x27;s Music Row district. In the two decades the studio was in operation, RCA Victor Studio B produced 60 percent of the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Country chart hits, and was an essential factor to the development of the musical production style and sound engineering technique known as the Nashville Sound. RCA operated the studio until January 1977, when the Nashville offices were closed and their properties located on Music Row were sold. Since 1992, the historic RCA Studio B in Nashville has been under the ownership of the Country Music Hall of Fame, which offers scheduled tours of the facilities.

===RCA Studio A, Nashville===

In 1964, Chet Atkins, Owen Bradley and Harold Bradley established the newer, larger RCA Victor Studio A at 806 17th Avenue South, adjacent to RCA&#x27;s existing studio (which was subsequently designated RCA Victor Studio B). The studio was operated by RCA until January 1977, when their Nashville offices were closed and properties located on Music Row were sold. In 2015, Studio A was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Since 2016, the studio has housed Low Country Sound, a record label imprint run by Dave Cobb The studio has since been refurbished and restored, along with the building&#x27;s original RCA Victor signage.

=== RCA Victor Music Center of the World, Hollywood===
In 1959, RCA Victor established the RCA Victor Music Center of the World at the former NBC Radio complex located at 1510 North Vine Street in Hollywood, California. The studio hosted recording sessions by Henry Mancini, Sam Cooke, and others. In 1964, RCA Victor opened a new facility and offices at 6363 Sunset Boulevard, which it operated until closing its Los Angeles studios in 1977. Artists including Jefferson Airplane, The Monkees and Elvis Presley recorded at this studio. The building is currently home to the Los Angeles Film School.

===RCA Mid-America Recording Center, Chicago===
In 1969, RCA established the RCA Mid-America Recording Center on 1 North Wacker Drive in Chicago. The studio utilized the acoustical expertise of the David Sarnoff Research Center, Known for recording such acts as the Guess Who, Alice Cooper, and Curtis Mayfield, the facility was closed in 1972.

==Criticisms and controversies==
===Kenny Rogers===
After Kenny Rogers left RCA Records in 1987, he accused the label of trying to ruin his career. Rogers had signed to RCA in 1982 for an advance sum of $20 million (the largest deal ever in country music up to that time) when Bob Summer was head of the label.

===Kelly Clarkson===
In the summer of 2007, Kelly Clarkson and Clive Davis, then head of Sony BMG, feuded publicly regarding the direction of her album &quot;My December&quot;, the follow-up to Clarkson&#x27;s multi-platinum album, &quot;Breakaway&quot;. Clarkson wrote the songs on &quot;My December&quot;, &quot;showcasing her own songwriting on darker, edgier rock-oriented fare&quot;, and Davis insisted Clarkson work with hired hitmakers, as she had previously, on &quot;polished, radio-friendly songs&quot;. Clarkson refused to change the album, and it was released in June 2007. It has since been certified platinum.

===Avril Lavigne===
In November 2010, Avril Lavigne stated that the long delay of her fourth album, &quot;Goodbye Lullaby&quot;, was due to &quot;a bunch of bureaucratic BS&quot; related to RCA. The album was ultimately released in March 2011. In October 2011, Lavigne confirmed that she had left RCA and signed with sister label Epic Records.

===Brooke Candy===
In early 2017, Brooke Candy left RCA before the release of her initially planned debut studio album &quot;Daddy Issues&quot;, citing creative stifling for her departure and accusing the label of taking control of her sound and image, as well as dictating what she could publicly say and do. She later claimed that she &quot;fought, bare-fucking knuckle, to get the fuck out of [RCA]&quot; and that Sony had taken ownership of the scrapped album&#x27;s recordings despite not allowing her to release them, leaving her back at square one musically.

=== R. Kelly ===
RCA ignored allegations of sexual misconduct by R. Kelly, which included running a violent cult, wherein he held teenage individuals hostage in exchange for sexual favors. Kelly continued to release music for RCA through 2018, when pressure from the Mute R. Kelly campaign mounted against him. In January 2019, following the broadcast of Lifetime&#x27;s documentary &quot;Surviving R. Kelly&quot;, his contract was terminated by RCA.

===Other notable events===

In the early 1920s, Victor was slow about getting deeply involved in recording and marketing black jazz and vocal blues. By the mid-to-late 1920s, Victor had signed Jelly Roll Morton, Bennie Moten, Duke Ellington and other black bands, and was becoming very competitive with Columbia and Brunswick, even starting their own V-38000 &quot;Hot Dance&quot; series that was marketed to all Victor dealers. They also had a V-38500 &quot;race&quot; (race records) series, a 23000 &#x27;hot dance&#x27; continuation of the V-38000 series, as well as a 23200 &#x27;Race&#x27; series with blues, gospel and some hard jazz. However, throughout the 1930s, RCA Victor&#x27;s involvement in jazz and blues slowed down and by the time of the musicians&#x27; strike and the end of the war, Victor was neglecting the R&amp;B (race) scene, which is one of the reasons so many independent companies sprang up so successfully.

In the early 1960s, RCA Victor demolished its Camden warehouse. This warehouse reportedly held four floors&#x27; worth of Victor&#x27;s catalog dating back to 1902 and vault masters (most of them were pre-tape wax and metal discs), test pressings, lacquer discs, matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. The company retained some of the more important masters (such as those by Enrico Caruso, Arturo Toscanini, George Gershwin,
Glenn Miller, Fats Waller and Jimmie Rodgers; why the masters of Sergei Rachmaninoff apparently were not saved is a mystery), but it is uncertain just how many others were saved or lost. A few days before the demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon afterward, record collectors and RCA Victor officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was dynamited, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, to celebrate the centenary of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s birth, RCA planned to reissue his complete recordings on LP; according to R. Peter Munves, director of RCA Red Seal at that time, RCA was forced to obtain copies of certain records from collectors because the RCA archives were incomplete, as documented in an article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

<text>The Action were an English band of the 1960s, formed as the Boys in August 1963, in Kentish Town, North West London. They were part of the mod subculture, and played soul music-influenced pop music.

==History==

=== 1963–1964: The Boys ===
The band was formed as the Boys in August 1963, in Kentish Town, North West London. The original members were Reg King (lead vocals), Alan &quot;Bam&quot; King (rhythm guitar, vocals), Mike &quot;Ace&quot; Evans (bass guitar) and Roger Powell (drums). Members Reg King and Powell had known each other since their schooldays, and were involved in the early days of the Scene Club in Soho, London, becoming pioneers in mod subculture and fashion. Alan King became the third band member, and brought Evans into the band. The Boys were then approached by Mike Court from Juke Box Jury, who referred them to band management, and asked them to venture forth into song-writing.

The Boys originated as a backing band for Sandra Barry, (sometimes referred to as Sandra Barry and the Boyfriends), and played on her single &quot;Really Gonna Shake&quot;, written by Reg King and released in March 1964 on Decca. After the stint with Barry, Pete Watson was recruited as lead guitarist, and the Boys had a brief period as a bar band in Brunswick, Germany. On returning to the United Kingdom, the band played a gig at The Birdcage Club in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and were recruited by manager Rikki Farr. In November 1964, the Boys released their first single &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Fair&quot; b/w &quot;I Want You&quot; on Pye. By early 1965, the band had changed their name to The Action.

=== 1965–1968: The Action ===
The Action first auditioned for Decca on May 31, 1965, with an assortment of demos such as &quot;In My Lonely Room&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Want Me Back&quot;, &quot;Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)&quot;, and &quot;Fine Looking Girl&quot;. However, the band were unsuccessful in securing a recording contract.

In 1965, they signed to Parlophone with producer George Martin, head of Associated Independent Recording (AIR). Released in October 1965, &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot; b/w &quot;In My Lonely Room&quot; was well received by critics, but sold poorly. The Action were renowned for their own arrangements of American Tamla Motown songs and releasing them as singles. In the band&#x27;s lifetime, none of The Action&#x27;s singles achieved success in the UK Singles Chart.

The Action began as a supporting act for The Who at the Marquee Club, in late 1965. The Who&#x27;s manager Kit Lambert felt the Action were too good to be a support act and that they sabotaged the Who&#x27;s constructed image. As a result, The Action were dropped as the support act. However, in no time at all, from December 1965, the Action had taken on a residency at the Marquee and regularly performed there throughout 1966, developing a mod following. Phil Collins was a regular attendee.

In 1966, the band released two more singles &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep Holding On&quot; and &quot;Baby, You&#x27;ve Got It&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep Holding On&quot; was not only the most highly regarded Action 45, but also one of the few Motown covers that is markedly superior to the original. The single was released in February 1966, and entered the Melody Maker single charts. It managed to reach No.42 (on March 5, 1966), and even as high as No.39, but soon faltered. On June 3, 1966, the band made an appearance on the Dick Clark show Where the Action Is, performing their single &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep Holding On&quot;, while being filmed outside the Royal Albert Hall, in South Kensington, London.

On July 31, 1966, the Action performed at the 6th National Jazz &amp; Blues Festival, a three-day event held at the Royal Windsor Racecourse. They headlined with Georgie Fame and early Cream.

In mid-1966, there were plans for a 1966 Action LP, but it was eventually dismissed. In August 1966, the band recorded an obscure composition by American writing team, Gerry Goffin and Carole King, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t It You&quot; – a highlight in their studio career. It would have stood a chance of becoming a hit, but for unknown reasons, the song was shelved. Eventually, it was released in 1969 with &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; b/w &quot;Wasn&#x27;t It You&quot; as a German B-side on Hansa, in the years following post-Action. Powell: &quot;I loved &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t It You&#x27;. It was a shame it never came out at the time, as I thought that it was the best song we did for a hit.&quot; Reg King had regarded it as one of his top three Action songs.

The Action made regular television appearances, despite not having any associated chart hit singles. They were on Ready Steady Go! (RSG), at least twice, most notably for their singles &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep Holding On&quot; and &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;. There was even a short documentary episode made on the band for the American television show The Twentieth Century, where the Action performed at Durham University in October 1966. Relying solely on a few singles for material, the Action were known to perform The Ronettes songs &quot;Do I Love You?&quot; and &quot;You Baby&quot; in their live sets; as George Martin was preoccupied with the Beatles&#x27; Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s recording sessions. The Action were noted for their three-part harmonies. Led by Reg King&#x27;s soulful vocals, Alan King and Pete Watson were very good harmony singers. However, dissatisfied with the stewardship of their manager Rikki Farr, Pete Watson left the band in late 1966.

In 1967, the Action continued as a quartet. They released their last two singles &quot;Never Ever&quot;, an original composition, and &quot;Shadows and Reflections&quot; with the B-side, &quot;Something Has Hit Me&quot;, co-written by Reg King with Melody Maker journalist and flatmate Nick Jones. The band was dropped by Parlophone in mid-1967, after their last single &quot;Shadows and Reflections&quot; failed to chart, by which time they had also parted ways with their manager Rikki Farr. George Martin&#x27;s company AIR had financed all of the Action&#x27;s recordings up to this point in their career, and the band had yet to experience any hits.For the second half of 1967, the Action assumed control of their own affairs. Keyboardist Ian Whiteman briefly joined, in an effort to expand their sound and to help secure the band with a new recording contract by November 1967. However, Whiteman had since left the band, and was driven out by Reg King&#x27;s increasingly unpredictable behaviour. Guitarist Martin Stone was soon recruited to fill his place.

The Action were now set about gathering original material for a new projected LP. The beginning of &quot;Rolled Gold&quot; was initially recorded with George Martin in mind as head producer, but no one at Parlophone was interested in the demo recordings at the time. Their demo recordings were in a radically different, Byrds-influenced psychedelic style, and it failed to secure the band with a long hoped-for record deal. During this time, the band temporarily worked with Georgio Gomelsky and engineer Carlos Olmes of Marmalade Records. (These 1967/68 demos were eventually released in the 1990s, under the title &quot;Rolled Gold&quot;). The Action&#x27;s profound and experimental masterpiece, &quot;Brain&quot; was recorded in these sessions, with its phasing, chord-driven guitars, rolling drums, dreamy bass, and Reg&#x27;s voice shouting and pleading the listeners to &quot;remember me&quot;&quot;.&quot; Yet such ventures risked confusing and alienating the band&#x27;s hardcore mod following. With the Action seemingly having reached an impasse, the demos were shelved for 30 years, and vocalist Reg King departed from the band in mid-1968. King was hired by Gomelsky to produce Gary Farr, and eventually pursued a solo career.

Following Reg King&#x27;s exit, Ian Whiteman returned and shared vocal duties with Alan King. It was at this point, that the band decided on a brief name change from the Action to Azoth. However, the band soon reverted to their old name, in order to record a new set of five demos. The demos captured the band&#x27;s transition into more of a mid-tempo, West Coast-influenced, psychedelic ballad style and early folk rock. (These demos were eventually released in 1985, under the title &quot;The Action Speaks Louder Than Words&quot;).

=== 1969–1971: Mighty Baby ===

By January 1969, upon signing to Head Records (a fledgling independent label run by their former roadie John Curd), the Action were finally and permanently re-christened Mighty Baby – under the name in which they released two albums: &quot;Mighty Baby&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Jug Of Love&quot; (1971). In 1971, the band featured and played on former band member Reg King&#x27;s solo album. Mighty Baby were practicing Muslims and disbanded at the end of the year, in 1971.

In the years immediately following the band&#x27;s breakup at the end of 1971, Martin Stone was a founding member of Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers, Alan King was a founding member of Ace and had a US hit with &quot;How Long&quot; in 1975. Roger Powell, Mike Evans and Ian Whiteman formed the Habibiyya.

== Legacy and reunion ==
In 1980, &quot;The Ultimate Action&quot;, a compilation album of the Action&#x27;s Parlophone tracks was released, with sleeve notes written by Paul Weller (&quot;The Action had it in their soul&quot;). It did much for the creditability of the band and their profile. Weller: &quot;I reckon Reggie King stands as one of the best of the white soul singers. In some ways his rich, smooth voice sounds a lot more natural than [Steve] Marriott&#x27;s.&quot; The Action&#x27;s Reg King was the singer for whom the term &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot; could have been invented—and he made the term a capability rather than a limitation. The term blue-eyed soul was originally coined for The Righteous Brothers by black DJs, and it became a general term for all white singers who sang what was then considered &quot;black music&quot;. According to King himself, the Action never played any songs by white artists.

The &quot;Rolled Gold&quot; album of demos were hailed by critics as lost classics, when they were reissued in the 1990s (formally released in 2002). In 1998, the original line-up of the Action reformed for a concert in the Isle of Wight. They headlined and played two shows at the Ryde Theatre for the New Untouchables August Bank Holiday Mod Rally. They also played at the Tufnell Park Dome and Boston Arms in London,1998 (&quot;Uptight and Outasight&quot;).

They are one of the favourite bands of Phil Collins, who performed with the reunited band at the 100 Club in June 2000. &quot;For me it was like playing with the Beatles&quot;, he later commented on the experience in 2002. Collins financed the documentary film &quot;In The Lap Of The Mods&quot; (2000), which contained footage from both reunion gigs, 100 Club and Tufnell Park Dome, as well as some archive material. In 2012, a biographical book titled &quot;The Action: In The Lap Of The Mods&quot; by Ian Hebditch and Jane Shepard, was released and forwarded by Sir George Martin.

Since their reunion in 1998, the Action played semi-regularly over the next six years. They made their final appearance at Modstock 2004, a three-day event organized by the New Untouchables to commemorate 40 years of Mod Subculture, on May 30, 2004.

During an interview in September 1986, Steve Marriott regarded the Action as a &quot;legitimate band&quot; and compared them to the likes of the Small Faces, in terms of street origins and authenticity in the 1960s Mod scene. Marriott: &quot;We all tried our hand at getting that [Motown] sound you know ... all the bands in the mid &#x27;60s. The best ones at it were the Action ... They were an amazing band.&quot;

<doc id="177259" wikidata="Q1384586" url="?curid=177259" title="Enschede fireworks disaster">
<text>The Enschede fireworks disaster was a catastrophic fireworks explosion on 13 May 2000 in Enschede, Netherlands. The explosion killed 23 people including four firefighters and injured 950 others. A total of 400 homes were destroyed and 1,500 buildings were subsequently damaged.

The first explosion had a strength in the order of , while the strength of the final explosion was in the range of . The biggest blast was felt as far as the city of Deventer, away. Fire crews were called in from across the border in Germany to help battle the blaze; it was brought under control by the end of the day.

S.E. Fireworks was a major supplier to pop concerts and major festive events in the Netherlands. Prior to the disaster it had a good safety record and met all safety audits.

==Cause==

The fire which triggered the explosion is believed to have started inside the central building of the S.E. Fireworks depot, in a work area where some of fireworks were stored. It then spread outside the building to two full shipping containers that were being used to illegally store more display incendiaries. When of fireworks exploded, it destroyed the surrounding residential area.

One theory to explain the large scale of the disaster was that internal fire doors in the central complex—which might otherwise have contained the fire—had been left open. Theoretically, an explosion was considered highly unlikely because the fireworks were stored in sealed bunkers specifically designed to minimize such risk. However, the illegal use of shipping containers reduced safety, particularly as they had been arranged closely together at ground level and had not been separated either by earthworks or other partitioning.

One week prior to the explosion, SE had been audited. The company was judged to have met all official safety regulations while the legally imported fireworks had been inspected by Dutch authorities and deemed safe. However, after the explosion, residents from the affected district of Roombeek—a poor, working-class neighbourhood—complained of government inaction and lack of interest, saying the whole disaster was just waiting to happen.

When it was built in 1977, the warehouse was outside the town, but as new residential areas were built it became surrounded by low-income housing. Residents and town councillors stated they did not even know that there was a fireworks warehouse in their area. Later in the court case, the judge said that city officials failed to take steps even when they knew laws had been broken. They acted &quot;completely incomprehensibly&quot; by allowing the company to expand, for fear that the city would have to pay the cost of moving S.E. Fireworks to another location.

==Damage==
A area around the warehouse was destroyed by the blast. The S.E. Fireworks factory was the only one in the Netherlands to be located in a residential area. This caused around 400 houses to be destroyed, 15 streets incinerated and a total of 1,500 homes damaged, leaving 1,250 people homeless, essentially obliterating the neighbourhood of Roombeek. Ten thousand residents were evacuated, and damages eventually neared 1 billion guilders (€454 million).

The Dutch Government warned that potentially harmful asbestos was released into the air by the explosion. The fire spread to the nearby Grolsch Beer brewery which had an asbestos roof. It was later demolished and closed; a replacement opened nearby in Boekelo in 2004.

== Death toll ==
By 22 May 2000, 18 people had been confirmed dead, including an elderly woman who died from her injuries in hospital on 21 May. On 24 May, the search for victims ended with three people still missing and presumed dead. A 19th victim died from her injuries in hospital on 19 October 2000. The addition of the three missing people to the death toll brought the total to 22. In 2005, Dutch media reported that a 26-year-old Enschede resident who had died in a local hospital on 2 October 2000 was unofficially being recognised as the 23rd victim of the disaster. Her widower clarified in an interview that while she sustained only minor injuries on the day of the disaster, she appeared to develop an eating disorder in the months thereafter, and that her doctor reported a &quot;direct connection&quot; between her death and the disaster without specifying whether or not she became physically ill as a result of the disaster or if illness was a factor in her death. A memorial at the site of the disaster lists her name along with the 22 victims included in the official death toll.

==Healthcare impact==
In 2005, a survey was published based on the electronic medical records of general practitioners, which compared 9,329 victims with a control sample size of 7,329 units ranging from 16 months before to 2.5 years after the disaster.

The study highlighted that &quot;two and a half years post-disaster the prevalence of psychological problems in victims, who had to relocate, was about double and in the non-relocated victims one-third more than controls&quot;. Relocated victims showed the highest increase of medically unexplained physical symptoms (tiredness, headache, nausea, and abdominal pain) and of gastrointestinal morbidity.

==Legal proceedings==
On 20 May, Dutch authorities issued an international arrest warrant for the two managers of the company, Rudi Bakker and Willie Pater, after they fled their homes, which were empty when searched. Pater handed himself in on the same day, and Bakker the day after.

In April 2002, the owners were sentenced to six months&#x27; imprisonment each for violation of environmental and safety regulations and dealing in illegal fireworks alongside a fine of €2,250 each. However, they were both acquitted of the more serious charges of negligence for the fire.

In May 2003, Arnhem Appeals Court acquitted 36-year-old André de Vries of arson. Almelo Court had originally (May 2002) tried and convicted De Vries of arson and sentenced him to 15 years imprisonment.

In February 2005, after a four-and-a-half-year legal battle, the six-month sentence of each of the owners was increased to twelve months each.

A total of €8.5m in compensation was awarded to the victims of the explosion, according to the organisation in charge of distributing the compensation, the UPV, having assessed 3,519 claims. Three hundred people received cash for incurring extra costs, 136 people received money for loss of income, and 1,477 people received compensation for health problems.

==Dutch fire safety regulations==
The S.E. Fireworks disaster led to intensified safety regulations in the Netherlands concerning the storage and sale of fireworks. The Roombeek area that was destroyed by the blast has since been rebuilt. Since the catastrophe, three illegal fireworks depots were closed down in the Netherlands.

==Memorials==
There have been annual public memorial services in Roombeek since 2000 led by the mayor Jan Mans, and commonly ending on the Stroinksbleekweg. The theme of 2004 was &quot;homecoming&quot;.

In 2005 a memorial was unveiled at the site of the disaster, titled &#x27;Het verdwenen huis tussen hemel en aarde&#x27; (The vanished house between heaven and earth) by Moldavian artist Pavel Balta. Part of the memorial consists of the floor of the former storage depot, crushed into the crater created by the explosion.

==In popular culture==
The events of the disaster served as the inspiration of the mission &quot;Explosion in fireworks factory&quot; from &quot;Emergency 4: Global Fighters for Life&quot;.

<text>Simba Wanyika was a Kenyan-based band created in 1971 by Tanzanian brothers Wilson Kinyonga and George Kinyonga, and disbanded in 1994. Simba Wanyika and its two offshoots, Les Wanyika and Super Wanyika Stars, became some of the most popular bands in Kenya. Their guitar-driven sound, inspired by the Soukous guitarist Dr. Nico, combined highly melodic rumba with lyrics sung in Swahili. &quot;Simba wa nyika&quot; means &quot;Lions of the Savannah&quot; in Swahili.

Wilson Kinyonga and George Kinyonga began as musicians in their hometown Tanga in Tanzania when they joined Jamhuri Jazz Band in 1966. They moved to Arusha in 1970 and formed Arusha Jazz with their other brother, William Kinyonga. During this period, musicians could travel freely between Kenya and Tanzania, and Kenyan popular music became heavily influenced by Tanzanian rumba musicians. In 1971 the Kinyonga brothers moved to Kenya and created Simba Wanyika. The band played at nightclubs and bars in the Nairobi area, and developed an enthusiastic following, and by the mid-1970s, they were well known throughout Kenya, thanks to hits like &quot;Mwongele&quot; and &quot;Wana Wanyika&quot;. They had a harder sound than most rumba bands and were almost unchallenged in that area in Kenya due to the closing of the Tanzanian border in 1977.

The restrictions enforced on the Kenya-Tanzania border consequently led to the divergence of Kenyan popular music towards the emerging benga music. Simba Wanyika continued playing rumba, and was still quite popular when the band split in the late 1970s when rhythm guitarist Omar Shabani (commonly referred to as Professor Omar Shabani) took many of the band&#x27;s musicians and forming Les Wanyika. In 1980, George Kinyonga also quit Simba Wanyika, taking more musicians with him to form Orchestra Jobiso. He eventually rejoined Simba Wanyika while still working with Jobiso on side projects. Simba Wanyika later changed their name to &quot;Simba Wanyika Original&quot; to prevent confusion with Les Wanyika and its splinter group, Super Wanyika Stars.

Simba Wanyika regained its popularity in the mid-1980s, releasing many hits and touring Europe in 1989. They disbanded in 1994, but several offshoots of the band still continue to play.

<text>Remembrance Sunday is held in the United Kingdom as a day to commemorate the contribution of British and Commonwealth military and civilian servicemen and women in the two World Wars and later conflicts. It is held on the second Sunday in November (the Sunday nearest to 11 November, Armistice Day, the anniversary of the end of hostilities in World War I in 1918). Remembrance Sunday, within the Church of England, falls in the liturgical period of Allsaintstide.

It is marked by ceremonies at local war memorials in most cities, towns and villages, attended by civic dignitaries, ex-servicemen and -women (many are members of the Royal British Legion and other veterans&#x27; organisations), members of local armed forces regular and reserve units (Royal Navy and Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marines and Royal Marines Reserve, Army and Territorial Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Auxiliary Air Force), military cadet forces (Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps as well as the Combined Cadet Force) and youth organisations (e.g. Scouts, Boys&#x27; Brigade, Girls&#x27; Brigade and Guides). Representatives of the Judiciary also lay wreaths at local war memorials throughout the country. Wreaths of remembrance poppies are laid on the memorials, and two minutes&#x27; silence is held at 11 am. Church bells are usually rung half-muffled, creating a sombre effect. The overall ceremony, including parades, service and wreath laying, typically lasts about two hours.

==History==
The focus of remembrance for the dead of the First World War originally fell on Armistice Day itself, commencing in 1919. As well as the National Service in London, events were staged at town and village war memorials, often featuring processions of civic dignitaries and veterans.

The first UK commemoration of the end of the First World War took place at Buckingham Palace, with King George V hosting a &quot;Banquet in Honour of The President of the French Republic&quot; in the evening of 10 November 1919. The first official Armistice Day events were subsequently held in the grounds of the Palace on the morning of 11 November 1919, which included a two-minute silence at 11am as a mark of respect for those who died in the war and those left behind. While the initial, spontaneous public reaction when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918 was jubilation and celebration, the 1919 banquet was criticised for being too celebratory.

The following year, Armistice Day in 1920, the funeral of the Unknown Soldier took place at the London Cenotaph and a two-minute silence was observed throughout the nation. Buses halted, electricity was cut to tram lines, and even trading on the London Stock Exchange halted.

Starting in 1921, the Royal British Legion began selling Remembrance poppies to raise funds for ex-servicemen. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the character of the remembrance events became politicised. While for some, Armistice Day was a day for recognising the horrors of war, never to be repeated; for others the day symbolised the honour of military service.

A Christian Pacifist MP was elected to parliament in 1923. In the mid-1930s the Peace Pledge Union gained wide support. Pacifism gained great publicity from a 1933 student debate in the Oxford University Union that voted for a resolution that &quot;this House will in no circumstances fight for King and Country&quot;. The first white poppies were sold by the Co-operative Women&#x27;s Guild in 1933.

During the Second World War, the commemorations were moved to the Sunday preceding 11 November as an emergency measure to avoid disruption of the production of vital war materials.

In May 1945, just before VE Day, the new government began consultation with the churches and the British Legion on the future of remembrance. Armistice Day in 1945 fell on a Sunday, preventing the need to change wartime practices. Some thought that continuing with 11 November would focus more on the First World War and downplay the importance of the Second. Other dates suggested were 8 May (VE Day), 6 June (D-Day), 15 August (VJ Day), 3 September (the declaration of war), and even 15 June (the signing of Magna Carta in 1215). The Archbishop of Westminster proposed that the second Sunday in November should be named Remembrance Sunday in commemoration of both World Wars, a suggestion which was endorsed by the Home Office in January 1946. In June of that year, the prime minister, Clement Attlee, announced in the House of Commons that &quot;the Government felt that this view would commend itself to all quarters of the country. I am glad to say that it has now found general acceptance here and has been approved by The King.&quot;

==National ceremony in the United Kingdom==

The national ceremony is held in London at the Cenotaph on Whitehall, starting with two minutes&#x27; silence at 11am and concluding with the end of The Nation&#x27;s Thank You procession at 1:30 p.m. The main part of the ceremony consists of the laying of wreaths by members of the royal family and other dignitaries, a service of remembrance with prayers and a hymn. It is immediately followed by a march past by thousands of ex-service personnel and contingents from other organisations. Marchers salute the Cenotaph as they pass and wreaths are handed over to be laid around it.

== Regional and local ceremonies ==
Significant ceremonies also take place in the capitals of the nations and across the regions of the United Kingdom. Most notably at the Scottish National War Memorial, in Edinburgh in the grounds of Edinburgh Castle, the Welsh National War Memorial in Cardiff and at the Northern Ireland War Memorial and Cenotaph in Belfast in the grounds of the Belfast City Hall.

Typically, poppy wreaths are laid by representatives of the Crown, the armed forces, and local civic leaders, as well as by local organisations such as ex-service organisations, cadet forces, the Scouts, Guides, Boys&#x27; Brigade, St John Ambulance and The Salvation Army. The start and end of the silence is often also marked by the firing of an artillery piece. A minute&#x27;s or two minutes&#x27; silence is also frequently incorporated into church services.

A common criticism of Remembrance Sunday ceremonies and the Royal British Legion is that by focusing only on veterans and military persons who have died, the vast majority of the casualties of war (civilians) are forgotten.

== British Overseas Territories ==
In the past, the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs laid a wreath on behalf of all the British Overseas Territories. However, since 2001 there has been a campaign by Britain&#x27;s Overseas Territories Association for the right to lay a wreath themselves at the annual service at the Cenotaph. In 2008 the Labour Government agreed that one wreath could be laid for all 14 territories by a representative of the territories.

== Northern Ireland ==
In Northern Ireland, Remembrance Sunday has tended to be associated with unionists. Most Irish nationalists and republicans do not take part in the public commemoration of British soldiers organised by the Royal British Legion. This is partly due to the actions of the British Army during The Troubles and its role in fighting against Irish independence. However, some moderate nationalists have attended Remembrance Day events as a way to connect with the unionist community. In 1987 a bomb was detonated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) just before a Remembrance Sunday ceremony in Enniskillen, killing twelve people. The IRA said it had made a mistake and had been targeting soldiers parading to the war memorial. The Ireland has its own National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish people who died in war.

==Other ceremonies==
From 1919 until 1945, Armistice Day observance was always on 11 November itself. It was then moved to Remembrance Sunday, but since the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in 1995, it has become usual to hold ceremonies on both Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday.

In 2006, then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown proposed that in addition to Remembrance Sunday, a new national day to celebrate the achievements of veterans should be instituted. The &quot;Veterans Day&quot;, to be held in the summer, would be similar to Veterans Day celebrations in the United States. This has now been renamed &quot;Armed Forces Day&quot;, to include currently serving troops to Service families, and from veterans to cadets. The first &quot;Armed Forces Day&quot; was held on 27 June 2009.

Submariners hold an additional remembrance walk and ceremony on the Sunday before Remembrance Sunday, which has The Submariners Memorial on London&#x27;s Victoria Embankment as its focal point.

==Outside the United Kingdom==
Outside the United Kingdom Anglican and Church of Scotland churches often have a commemorative service on Remembrance Sunday. In the Republic of Ireland there is an ecumenical service in St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, the Church of Ireland&#x27;s national cathedral. Since 1993 the President of Ireland has attended this service. The state has its own National Day of Commemoration in July for all Irish men and women who have died in war. In the United States it is celebrated by many Anglo-Catholic churches in the Episcopal Church. The Anglican Church of Korea also celebrates the day to commemorate, in particular, the Commonwealth soldiers who fought in the Korean War with a service at the Seoul Anglican Cathedral.

In New Zealand an attempt was made to change Armistice Day to Remembrance Sunday after World War II but it was a failure, partly owing to competition from Anzac Day.
Every year, the British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, India, organises a Remembrance Sunday Commemoration at the Glorious Dead Cenotaph in the Maidan.

== Poppies ==
Remembrance poppies are a traditional symbol of Remembrance Sunday; they may be worn individually on clothing or made into wreaths. Red paper poppies are sold by British Legion.

It is a common theme in British tabloid journalism in October and November to &quot;expose&quot; politicians and celebrities who have chosen not to wear a red Royal British Legion poppy. Critics have labelled this &quot;poppy fascism&quot;, as persons who refuse to wear poppies on TV or at sporting events have received death threats.

<doc id="177264" wikidata="Q530758" url="?curid=177264" title="Donald Wolfit">
<text>Sir Donald Wolfit (born Donald Woolfitt; 20 April 1902 – 17 February 1968) was an English actor-manager, known for his touring productions of Shakespeare. He was especially renowned for his portrayal of King Lear.

Born to a conventional middle-class family in Nottinghamshire, Wolfit was stage-struck from an early age. His debut was at the Robin Hood Opera House at Aveling to which he cycled from school to join the theatre rep company. After a brief spell as a teacher he joined the touring company of the actor-manager Charles Doran, and later that of Fred Terry. He made his London début in 1924 and simplified the spelling of his surname from Woolfitt to Wolfit.

In 1929 Wolfit joined Lilian Baylis&#x27;s company at the Old Vic but developed a strong antipathy to the leading man, John Gielgud, and left the company after a single season. He joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre companies for the festivals of 1936 and 1937, in thirteen major roles, winning excellent reviews for his performance as Hamlet. He then set up his own touring company, taking the plays of Shakespeare and others all round Britain and from time to time overseas. He continued to appear in the West End and made several films, but his main concern was for his touring company. Its standards were criticised, but several members moved on to greater fame, including Harold Pinter and Brian Rix.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Wolfit was born at New Balderton, near Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, on 20 April 1902, the second son and fourth of five children of William Pearce Woolfitt and his wife Emma, &quot;née&quot; Tomlinson. It was a conventional household; Woolfitt senior was an Anglican churchgoer, a Conservative supporter and a Freemason. From his early childhood Wolfit wanted to become an actor, despite his father&#x27;s disapproval.

After education at Magnus Grammar School in Newark he was briefly a schoolmaster in Eastbourne before successfully auditioning for the actor-manager Charles Doran. Doran&#x27;s touring company was a training ground for many British actors, including Ralph Richardson, Cecil Parker, Edith Sharpe, Norman Shelley, Abraham Sofaer and FrancisL Sullivan. Wolfit&#x27;s début role, at the Theatre Royal, York on 13 September 1920, was Biondello in Doran&#x27;s production of &quot;The Taming of The Shrew&quot;. Between his engagement with Doran and his West End début in 1924 he toured with the companies of Alexander Marsh and later Fred Terry. For the rest of his life Wolfit acknowledged his debt to the latter for what he had learnt from him.

Wolfit made his London début on 26 November 1924 at the New Theatre, as Phirous in Matheson Lang&#x27;s production of &quot;The Wandering Jew&quot;. At about this time he simplified the spelling of his surname from Woolfitt to Wolfit. He appeared in supporting roles in a variety of West End productions, and at St George&#x27;s, Westminster, on 16 April 1928, he married an actress, Chris Frances Castor, with whom he had a daughter. The marriage lasted until 1933, when the couple divorced.

In 1929 Wolfit joined Lilian Baylis&#x27;s company at the Old Vic and played Tybalt in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Cassius in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, Touchstone in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Macduff in &quot;Macbeth&quot; and Claudius in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The company&#x27;s leading man was John Gielgud, to whom Wolfit took a strong and lasting dislike, envious of Gielgud&#x27;s success and being what the biographer Sheridan Morley describes as &quot;virulently anti-homosexual&quot;. Wolfit made himself unpopular with his fellow actors and his contract was not renewed after the first year.

===1930s===
After further West End appearances, Wolfit joined Sir Barry Jackson&#x27;s company in 1931 for a six-month tour of Canada. He played Robert Browning in &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot;, Young Marlowe in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, Joe Varwell in &quot;Yellow Sands&quot;, Coade in &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; and Shakespeare in &quot;The Dark Lady of the Sonnets&quot;. He overcame his hatred of Gielgud enough to accept the role of Thomas Mowbray in &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot; (1932) with a cast headed by Gielgud and Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies; the piece ran for more than a year. Wolfit made a impression in 1933 in the title role of a one-night-only production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Arts Theatre using the First Quarto text rather than the First Folio text usually given. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said:
Encouraged by this success Wolfit determined to try his hand as an actor-manager. He secured financial backing and staged a week-long drama festival in his native Newark in 1934. He presented &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, &quot;The Master Builder&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, playing Bluntschli, Solness and Malvolio. Among the actors he engaged were John Clements, Elspeth March, Margaret Rutherford and Margaret Webster. In the same year, on 15 September, he married Susan Katherine Anthony; they had a son and a daughter. He made his first film appearance in 1934, as St Francis of Assisi in a short film called &quot;Inasmuch&quot;. He appeared in other films in the 1930s, after which he did not work in films again until the 1950s.

Wolfit joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre companies for the festivals of 1936 and 1937, with eight major roles in the first, including Hamlet, and five in the second. His Hamlet was favourably reviewed by the critics and, according to his biographer Ronald Harwood, &quot;the performance of Hamlet elevated Wolfit to the ranks of leading players&quot;. The critic Audrey Williamson wrote that although Wolfit was never as physically suited as Gielgud to the role of Hamlet, in his Stratford performances he gave the character &quot;an electric drive and force of suffering ... There was thought behind every gesture and line and again and again one was struck by the subtlety of detail&quot;. Another critic wrote, &quot;Mr Wolfit has crowned his season&#x27;s work with a distinguished performance not unworthy of comparison with the great Hamlets&quot;. 
The director at Stratford was Ben Iden Payne, whose daughter Rosalind Iden became Wolfit&#x27;s leading lady. He fell in love with her, left his wife, and lived with Iden, eventually marrying her in 1948.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of the Second World War, despite strong advice to the contrary, Wolfit refused to cancel his plans for an autumn tour. He told the press, &quot;Here is my national effort at present. They don&#x27;t want me in the Services yet, so I am endeavouring to carry on with my plans. All my company are waiting to serve when called on&quot;. The company played a season in 1940 at the Kingsway Theatre in London. Later that year Wolfit presented lunch-time &quot;Scenes from Shakespeare&quot; at the Strand Theatre during the Blitz. A German bomb destroyed his scenery and costume store, but he continued to tour. In 1944 he visited Egypt for the Entertainments National Service Association, followed by seasons in Paris and Brussels.

===Postwar===
Wolfit toured more often than he played in London. Hermione Gingold adapted an old theatrical joke, saying that &quot;Olivier is a tour-de-force, and Wolfit is forced to tour&quot;, but in fact Wolfit preferred touring with his own company and was often unhappy in West End productions, beholden to directors and acting alongside major actors to whom he was not clearly superior. He firmly believed that Shakespeare should be taken to the people, and used West End appearances and films to subsidise his touring company. After the war he continued his annual tours in Britain and in 1947 he presented two successful tours of Canada, a season in New York and a London season at the Savoy Theatre.

Hoping to present his company in another London season in 1949, Wolfit found that no West End theatre was available and instead he took an old music hall, The Bedford, in Camden Town, north London. He presented a sixteen-week season of &quot;Shakespeare at popular prices&quot;, and played to packed houses. &quot;The Stage&quot; said of his performance in &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;There is no acting in our theatre to-day as magnificent as that of Donald Wolfit when he plays Lear&quot;, but his productions had cheap costumes and scenery and his company was below his own standard of acting. Among the audience during this season was the young Bernard Levin, who later wrote that although &quot;Wolfit and his dreadful company ... horribly travestied Shakespeare&quot; they nevertheless enabled young people to come to know and love the plays, and for this Levin held Wolfit&#x27;s memory in high honour. Levin recalled Wolfit&#x27;s customary curtain call, &quot;with the old megalomanic, as he thanked the audience, indulging in the same exhausted clutch of the curtain&quot;, which Stephen Potter said he did whether he had been &quot;laying himself out with Lear or trotting through twenty minutes of Touchstone&quot;.

In 1950 Wolfit was appointed CBE. In that year Tyrone Guthrie invited him to return to the Old Vic to play Lear, Timon of Athens, Lord Ogleby in &quot;The Clandestine Marriage&quot;, and Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot;. He had great success in these roles but according to Harwood he &quot;chafed at performing in a company other than his own and surrounded by excellent supporting actors&quot;. He quarrelled with Guthrie and left the company.

Wolfit returned to actor-management in 1953 with a season at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Hammersmith, with a stronger company than usual. He opened to enthusiastic reviews and full houses for a double bill of &quot;Oedipus the King&quot; and &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, but, in Harwood&#x27;s words, later in the season, and for the last time, &quot;he resorted to his tired Shakespearian productions, in which, however, he gave some magnificent performances&quot;. Although Wolfit&#x27;s touring companies were frequently criticised, they nevertheless included, among many less familiar names, future stars such as Peter Jones, Harold Pinter, Eric Porter, Brian Rix, Frank Thornton and Richard Wattis.

In 1957 Wolfit announced his retirement as an actor-manager, but after his knighthood in that year he emerged from retirement and undertook one final tour under his own management. A major role of his later years was the title character of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; at the Duchess Theatre in 1963. One critic said that Wolfit&#x27;s performance would have pleased Ibsen, and deserved to be regarded as the definitive portrayal. Wolfit&#x27;s last stage appearance was in the musical &quot;Robert and Elizabeth&quot;, as the tyrannical Mr Barrett in 1966–67. 

Wolfit died in the Royal Masonic Hospital, London, on 17 February 1968 and was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Church, Hurstbourne Tarrant, Hampshire.

<doc id="177267" wikidata="Q420683" url="?curid=177267" title="Suet">
<text>Suet is the raw, hard fat of beef, lamb or mutton found around the loins and kidneys.

Suet has a melting point of between and congelation between . Its high smoke point makes it ideal for deep frying and pastry production.
The primary use of suet is to make tallow, although it is also used as an ingredient in cooking, especially in traditional baked puddings, such as British Christmas pudding. Suet is made into tallow in a process called rendering, which involves melting fats and extended simmering, followed by straining, then cooling. The entire process is then usually repeated to refine the product.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;suet&quot; is derived from Anglo-Norman , from Old French , from Latin (&#x27;tallow&#x27;, &#x27;grease&#x27;, &#x27;hard animal fat&#x27;). &quot;Sebum&quot; is from the Proto-Indo-European root (&#x27;pour out, trickle&#x27;), so it shares a root with &quot;sap&quot; and &quot;soap&quot;.

== Trade ==
In the 17th century economy of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile&#x27;s husbandry and agriculture based economy had a peripheral role exporting mainly suet, jerky and leather to the other provinces of the viceroyalty. The importance of this trade led Chilean historian Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna to label the 17th century the &quot;century of suet&quot; ().

== Cuisine ==
Suet is found in several traditional British dishes. Suet pastry is soft in contrast to the crispness of shortcrust pastry, which makes it ideal for certain sweet and savoury dishes. Suet is most widely used in sweet British baked puddings, such as jam roly-poly and spotted dick. Savoury dishes include dumplings, which are made using a mixture of suet, flour and water rolled into balls that are added to stews during the final twenty minutes or so of cooking. In the savoury dish steak and kidney pudding, a bowl is lined with a suet pastry, the meat is placed inside and a lid of suet pastry tightly seals the meat. The pudding is then steamed for approximately four hours before serving. Suet is also an ingredient of traditional mincemeat, which is also referred to as &#x27;fruit mince&#x27;.

As it is the fat from around the kidneys, the connective tissue, blood and other non-fat content must be removed. It then must be coarsely grated. It must be refrigerated prior to use and used within a few days of purchase, similar to raw meat.

Due to its high energy content, cold weather explorers use suet to supplement the high daily energy requirement needed to travel in such climates. Typically the energy requirement is around 5,000–6,000 Cal per day for sledge hauling or dog-sled travelling. Suet is added to food rations to increase the fat content and help meet this high energy requirement.

==Availability==

Pre-packaged suet sold in supermarkets is dehydrated suet. It is mixed with flour to make it stable at room temperature, requiring some care when using it for recipes calling for fresh suet, as the proportions of flour to fat can change. Most modern processed recipes stipulate packaged suet.

Also available is vegetable suet, which is made from refined vegetable oil.

==Cultural and religious restrictions==

Consumption of suet is forbidden according to Jewish law and it was reserved for ritual altar sacrifices. This restriction only applies to those animals which were used for sacrifices, and thus does not include wild animals such as deer. Maimonides in his book Guide To The Perplexed, writes that one of the ideas behind this commandment is that the Torah wants to teach people to develop the discipline to avoid very tasty foods that are unhealthy.

==Bird feed==
Cakes of suet are popularly used for feeding wild birds and may be made with other solid fats, such as lard. Rolled oats, bird seed, cornmeal, raisins, and unsalted nuts are often incorporated into the suet cakes.

In North America, birds such as woodpeckers, goldfinches, juncos, cardinals, thrushes, jays, kinglets, bluebirds, chickadees, nuthatches, wrens, and starlings prefer bird feeders offering suet.

<text>Procol Harum () were an English rock band formed in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, in 1967. Their best-known recording is the 1967 hit single &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, one of the few singles to have sold more than 10 million copies. Although noted for their baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum&#x27;s music is described as psychedelic rock and proto-prog with hints of the blues, R&amp;B, and soul.

In 2018, the band was honoured by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; was inducted into the new Singles category. They were previously nominated as performers in 2012.

== History ==
=== Formation ===
In 1966, after Southend-on-Sea-based group The Paramounts were unable to generate any follow-up success with their UK top 40 single &quot;Poison Ivy&quot;, the group disbanded. Their frontman Gary Brooker decided to retire from performing and focus on songwriting, and his old friend Guy Stevens introduced him to lyricist Keith Reid. In April 1967, after several months writing together while failing to find any artists interested in performing their songs, Brooker and Reid decided to form their own band which would use their songs as their sole material. Brooker, in addition to vocals and the piano, was also proficient on the organ, trombone, cornet, piano accordion and Bengal flute. 

Paramounts&#x27; drummer Barrie &quot;B. J.&quot; Wilson agreed to stay on and rehearse for the new group and auditions brought them bassist David Knights and two members of George Bean and the Runners, Richard Brown (guitar) and Alan Morris (organ). But the lack of gigs and money led to the dispersal of this grouping before they even got out of the rehearsal hall, with only Knights staying on.
They next teamed with organist Matthew Fisher, who had left Screaming Lord Sutch&#x27;s backing group The Savages and advertised for work. Reid said he was right for Procol Harum just from talking to him and decided before hearing him play. Guitarist Ray Royer was chosen after the group placed an advertisement for players and were inundated, so the band &quot;really grilled the applicants&quot; to find &quot;someone with the right state of mind.&quot; Reid said bassist David Knights had also been chosen in a similar manner to Fisher, in that he was right for the group &quot;as a person&quot;, and had an original playing style. Drummer Bobby Harrison completed the line-up, after the group had tried out up to nine drummers by this point. Reid said Harrison was the first that the band &quot;could really work with&quot;, and had a sense of humour that helped balance out the more serious personality that Reid and the rest of the band had. The band chose Stevens as their manager.

The group named themselves after a male blue Burmese cat, which had been bred by Eleonore Vogt-Chapman and belonged to Liz Coombes, a friend. Stevens suggested the group name themselves after the cat, which the group immediately accepted. However, the cat&#x27;s pedigree name was in fact Procul Harun, the Procul being the breeder&#x27;s prefix, but the name was taken down over the telephone, leading to a misspelling. Although people informed the band that the name is Latin for &quot;beyond these things&quot;, this is incorrect as the correct term would be &quot;procul hīs&quot;.

=== &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; and debut album (1967–1968)===

In April 1967 the group entered Olympic Studios in London to record their debut single, &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;. They were joined by session drummer Bill Eyden in place of Harrison (though Harrison did play on the B-side &quot;Lime Street Blues&quot;), producer Denny Cordell and sound engineer Keith Grant. With a structure reminiscent of Baroque music, the song features a countermelody loosely based on J. S. Bach&#x27;s Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D Major played by Fisher&#x27;s Hammond organ. An enthusiastic response from listeners of the pirate radio station Radio London prompted Deram Records to rush-release the single for 12 May 1967. It was an instant worldwide success, reaching No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for six weeks and the same spot in eleven countries. In three weeks, it became the fastest selling record by a new group. In the US, it peaked at No. 5 and the song has since sold over 10 million copies worldwide.
Around the same time, Cordell suggested that Jonathan Weston be brought in to co-manage the band with Stevens.

Procol Harum played their first live gig at London&#x27;s Speakeasy club on the day &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; was released on 12 May 1967. They performed a set of mostly Brooker/Reid songs mixed with covers of Bob Dylan, The Rascals and Tim Rose tunes. Jimi Hendrix was an early vocal supporter of the band and attended their first show where, at the start of their performance of Rose&#x27;s &quot;Morning Dew&quot;, he went on stage, took Knights&#x27; bass and joined in.

After 18 June, the group would not play live in the UK until the following year.

On 15 July 1967, the group announced the June departure of Royer and Harrison and their split from Weston as manager. Fisher later said that the major issue for the split with Weston was when he organised an extensive UK tour for Procol Harum too soon after the release of &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, resulting in the group performing &quot;for £60 per night instead of £500.&quot; Following the addition of guitarist Robin Trower and the return of B. J. Wilson, the band secured new management under Tony Secunda. The departures brought about what Brooker described as &quot;great lawsuits and expense&quot; from Royer, Harrison, and Weston, and initial session drummer Eyden filed his own suit. Roughly three months into their partnership with Secunda, the band hired two Americans, Bennett Glotzer and Ronnie Lyons, to manage them in the US.

The group&#x27;s follow-up single, &quot;Homburg&quot;, was released in September 1967. The song reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 34 in the US. In the same month their debut album, &quot;Procol Harum&quot;, recorded between the two hit singles, was released in the US. Brooker said its release soon after the singles put the band in good stead in the US, but the problems created by the line-up changes, subsequent lawsuits and new management delayed its release in the UK until December. Brooker said it was at this point where the band &quot;had lost the British audience.&quot;

=== Follow-up albums and break-up (1968–1977) ===
The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Shine on Brightly&quot; was released the following year and saw a greater excursion into progressive rock stylings. It reached number 24 in the US but failed to chart in the UK. Finding themselves labelled as one-hit wonders in their home country, while in the US their reputation as a live act only continued to improve, for the next several years Procol Harum spent most of their time touring America.

Their third album, &quot;A Salty Dog&quot; (1969), was popular among fans and their first album to sell well in the UK. The title track in particular gained a good deal of US FM radio airplay, and the album is now considered a rock classic, appealing to fans of The Beatles, The Moody Blues and Pink Floyd. Procol Harum were asked to perform at the Woodstock Festival in August 1969, but were unable after Trower&#x27;s wife was expecting a baby and needed to return to England.

Later in 1969, Fisher left the band and was replaced by Chris Copping, another former member of The Paramounts, who played organ and bass. The group appeared at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival.

By 1971, the disparities in style had become too great and, after the release of their fifth album &quot;Broken Barricades&quot;, Trower left to form his own power trio. He was replaced by Dave Ball, while Alan Cartwright (a former bandmate of Wilson&#x27;s in Freddie Mack&#x27;s band) took over bass from Copping, who remained on organ.

In mid-1971, Procol Harum severed ties with Glotzer and Lyons and legally fought an accounting dispute which was settled out of court. The band went on to sign with Chrysalis Records and completed a successful UK tour opening for Jethro Tull.

During the band&#x27;s 1971 tour, Procol Harum recorded their show on 18 November in Edmonton, Alberta with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra and a choir for a live album. Released in April 1972, &quot;Procol Harum Live: In Concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra&quot; was met with commercial success when it peaked at No. 5 in the US, where it was certified gold for selling 500,000 copies. In the UK, it peaked at No. 48. The live rendition of &quot;Conquistador&quot; from their debut album reached No. 16 in the US and No. 22 in the UK.

After Dave Ball left, Mick Grabham was the group&#x27;s guitarist from 1972 until 1977.

The band continued with their new symphonic rock sound on their follow-up, &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. Released in March 1973, the album reached No. 21 in the US. It did not chart in the UK, but it was certified silver for selling over 60,000 copies there.

The band returned to its hard rock roots with their seventh studio album &quot;Exotic Birds and Fruit&quot;, released in April 1974. Reid said the group made a conscious attempt to &quot;dispel that symphonic image&quot; that they had been attached to and has a similar sound to their debut. The album&#x27;s sleeve was absent of lyrics in the liner notes.

In 1975 Procol Harum played the final night at the Rainbow Theatre in London before its refurbishment.

The personnel changes contributed to declining sales in the later part of the 1970s, with &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; being the final UK Top 20 hit in 1975. Its parent album &quot;Procol&#x27;s Ninth&quot; saw a re-connection with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who both produced and wrote with the band.

In 1976 the band regrouped to record their final album of the 1970s, &quot;Something Magic&quot;. This marked the departure of Cartwright, after Brooker thought Copping was a better bassist which led to the arrival of newcomer Pete Solley on keyboards. The album&#x27;s producers were not impressed with the group&#x27;s material, which took the form of &quot;The Worm and the Tree&quot;, an extended track that originated from a theme of Brooker&#x27;s that the band had attempted some years before, but the group &quot;made it up as we went along&quot; in the studio.

&quot;Something Magic&quot; was released in March 1977 and peaked at No. 147 in the US. During the subsequent tour, the band celebrated their tenth anniversary with a concert at the Palladium Theatre in New York City in May.

In April 1977, during the promotional tour for &quot;Something Magic&quot;, Copping joined Frankie Miller&#x27;s band and was replaced in Procol Harum by Elton John&#x27;s former bassist Dee Murray. The tour ended in May, and the following month Grabham announced that he had left the band, claiming that he had been &quot;generally dissatisfied with my role ... for some months&quot;. The band played one final show in October when &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; co-won the Single of the Year award at the 1977 Brit Awards, with Brooker, Wilson and returning members Cartwright and Copping joined by guitarist Tim Renwick.

=== Reformation and the 1990s ===
After Reid and Brooker teamed up to write once again in late 1989, the band reformed in 1991, with Brooker, Fisher, Trower and Reid (Wilson had died in 1990 after three years in a persistent vegetative state following a drug overdose) and released &quot;The Prodigal Stranger&quot;, but sales were modest. After the album&#x27;s release, a new incarnation of the band, with Brooker and Fisher but not Trower, toured the US and the world for a few years in the first half of the 1990s. Tim Renwick took over on guitar, with Dave Bronze on bass and Mark Brzezicki on drums. Renwick was replaced later in the year by Geoff Whitehorn.

After a tour which spawned &quot;One More Time: Live in Utrecht 1992&quot;, Fisher briefly stepped away from the band to focus on studying for a degree, with Don Snow temporarily taking over for a summer tour. Laurence Cottle substituted for Bronze, who was performing with the Hamsters, at a show in August.

After nearly a year of inactivity, Procol Harum performed a handful of shows in May and June 1993, with former Diamond Head keyboardist Josh Phillips filling in for Fisher and former King Crimson drummer Ian Wallace in place of Brzezicki, who had rejoined Big Country. Fisher returned for shows starting in July, and Matt Pegg replaced Bronze the following month. Touring continued sporadically throughout the rest of the decade – Graham Broad performed drums for a run of shows in July and August 1995, and Henry Spinetti took over for shows in 1996.

In August 1995 Procol Harum played at the Cropredy Music Festival, as guests of Fairport Convention. They also toured US and UK the same year, performing at several locations.

In July 1997 fans arranged the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the success of &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; and invited the then-inactive band to play a concert at Redhill, Surrey. The band played a one-off show in celebration of the 30th anniversary of &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, with the regular lineup joined on several songs by former members Mick Grabham, Peter Solley, Alan Cartwright, Dave Bronze and Chris Copping.

In late 1999, Brooker promised that &quot;Procol will play in 2000&quot;, and in September the band played an open-air gig with the New London Sinfonia in Guildford.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000 Procol Harum received some attention after the song &quot;In Held Twas in I&quot; appeared on the band Transatlantic&#x27;s debut album.

Since 2001 the band, comprising Brooker, Fisher, Geoff Whitehorn (guitar), Matt Pegg (bass) and Mark Brzezicki (drums), has made several tours of mostly Europe, but also Japan and the US. A 2001 concert in Copenhagen, Denmark was released on DVD in 2002. In 2003 the band released a new studio album, &quot;The Well&#x27;s on Fire&quot; and appeared at the Progman Cometh festival in Seattle. Their concert in London on Friday 12 December 2003, with much of the material from that album, was released on DVD in 2004: &quot;Live at the Union Chapel&quot;.

Long-time organist Matthew Fisher left the band in June 2004 due to &quot;unresolved matters&quot;, with former stand-in Josh Phillips taking his place on Hammond again, leaving Brooker as the only original performing member. These matters were later revealed to have been a lawsuit filed by Fisher against Brooker and the band for songwriting credits and a share of royalties on &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, which he won in December 2006.

The band resumed a limited touring schedule in 2005. In June 2006 they played at the Isle of Wight Festival. In August they played two outdoor concerts with the Danish Radio Orchestra at Ledreborg Castle in Denmark, which were tele-recorded. An hour-long edit of the show was broadcast on Christmas morning 2008 on Danish Channel DR2 and the full concert was issued on DVD on 11 May 2009 (with six extra tracks from a Danish television recording of the band from 1974).

Later in 2006, they played in Switzerland, Norway and Denmark, but with Geoff Dunn replacing Brzezicki on drums, because the latter&#x27;s other band Casbah Club was touring with The Who. Then Dunn ended up replacing Brzezicki permanently for the band&#x27;s European tour in 2007. Recordings from the Italian concerts were later released as &quot;One Eye to the Future – Live in Italy 2007&quot;. Procol Harum also played an orchestral concert in Sweden on 30 June. They performed with the Gävle Symphony Orchestra at the outdoor opera venue Dalhalla, near Rättvik.

On 20 and 21 July 2007 fans arranged the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the success of &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; and invited the band to play. This took the form of two concerts at St John&#x27;s, Smith Square in London. 20 July saw Procol Harum play a mixture of songs from their early days through to the début of a couple of new songs, &quot;Sister Mary&quot; and &quot;Missing Persons&quot;. The following night &#x27;Gary Brooker and Guests&#x27; performed a mixture of obscure songs by Brooker–Reid that had either never been recorded, never been performed live before or were significantly different from the versions they recorded.

Although there was no Procol Harum activity in 2008, their manager Chris Cooke, on the web site Beyond the Pale, announced plans for a live DVD and a new album in 2009, as well as festival concerts in Norway on 17 July and Finland on 23 July. Just before the latter concert, Brooker fell off a pile of road-side logs in Finland and broke several ribs. The show went ahead but he was unable to sing properly, and many of the songs were performed either as instrumentals or sung by others in the band.

In October 2009 with Brooker fully recovered, the band performed four concerts  – in Hagen (Germany), Drammen (Norway), Moscow and St Petersburg. &quot;All This and More&quot;, a four-disc retrospective (three CDs and a DVD with historical notes) was released in the autumn of 2009, and Salvo also issued all of the band&#x27;s previous albums as remastered CDs with extra tracks, some never previously heard.

=== 2010s ===

Procol played a string of US (and Toronto) concert dates in June 2010, mostly opening for Jethro Tull. On 22 July Procol again headlined at the Keitelejazz Festival in Äänekoski, Finland – the venue where the band performed with an injured Brooker in 2009. They described this loyal Finnish audience as &quot;the best in the world&quot; and played a unique three-verse version of &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; with a guitar solo from Geoff Whitehorn. 48 hours later Procol were invited to give a free concert at the courtyard of the Palace of the Province of Bergamo in Italy.

In August 2010 they appeared in Bad Krozingen in Germany and a Rock Legends event at the Dolina Charlotty Amphitheater in Poland. After a Halloween gig in Leamington Spa (their first in the UK for three years) the band returned to North America in November, including a return orchestral event with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra on 9 November. After playing in Tallinn, Estonia on 18 November, they returned to the US for an orchestral concert in Wilmington, Delaware on 4 December. Over 13,000 people saw eight New Year concerts with the Danish Radio Orchestra in Copenhagen and other Danish cities in January 2011.

On 29 May 2012 Gary Brooker was hospitalised after suffering a fall in his hotel room in Cape Town. He was due to have performed with his band at GrandWest Arena on the 30th, with fellow Brits 10cc and The Moody Blues, in a tour billed as the &#x27;British Invasion&#x27; and then again in Johannesburg on Friday 1 June 2012. Brooker (whose birthday it was) had been in his room at the five-star Table Bay Hotel. He was admitted to the ICU of the Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital with a serious skull fracture.

The band returned to Denmark for the Kløften Festival on 25 June before embarking on a 27-date U.S. tour supporting Yes.

In 2012 the Japanese artist Yumi Matsutoya came to London to record &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; with Procol Harum, a band she considered an inspiration for her work. She sang a duet with Gary Brooker on this new version of the 1967 classic, which featured three verses and a guitar solo by Geoff Whitehorn. Yumi and Procol Harum then played a series of December concerts in major Japanese cities, one of which was recorded for a later television showing (on 31 March 2013).
Also in 2012, Henry Scott-Irvine published a biography of the band, &quot;Procol Harum – The Ghosts of A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;. Scott-Irvine also hosted a rare Procol Harum film evening at the BFI on the South Bank, which was attended by members of the group.

In September 2012 Procol Harum was among fifteen final nominees for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2013 (induction 18 April 2013). In the subsequent election that December, however, the band failed to gain enough votes for election.

In March and April 2013 Procol Harum played a series of five orchestral concerts in Denmark and two such events in Wuppertal in Germany. Four band-only concerts in Sweden &amp; Finland were held in early October.

In 2014 the band toured again in France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada (Ottawa with orchestra) and the Eastern U.S. The band also played a five-song set at Kenney Jones&#x27; Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Horsepower charity event at Ewhurst, Surrey in June, on a bill including Alvin Stardust, John Lodge, Nik Kershaw, Mike Rutherford, Judie Tzuke and The Who. A twin CD, &quot;Inside &amp; Outside&quot;, was issued with studio tracks from the Chrysalis years and a live CD including new material and performances of tracks from their first four Zonophone albums.

On Monday 24 November Procol Harum appeared at the Dominion Theatre in London with the BBC Concert Orchestra and Crouch End Festival Chorus in an event recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s Friday Night is Music Night on 28 November. Guitarist Geoff Whitehorn was hospitalised during rehearsals and at short notice Rick Wakeman&#x27;s guitarist Dave Colquhoun deputised (on crutches, after a broken ankle). He played a guitar solo in the first extended, orchestrated version of Keith Reid&#x27;s 9/11 tribute song &quot;Blink of an Eye&quot;, dedicated by Gary Brooker to the brave firefighters of the 8th Avenue station who the band often talked with after gigs in New York.

The band&#x27;s 13th album, &quot;Novum&quot;, was released on 21 April 2017 and the band played 36 dates in the UK and Europe to promote it. However, the most significant concert of the year came in March when the band played with an orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Whilst leaving the stage at the end of the first half, Gary Brooker fell and was seriously hurt. He reappeared for the second half with his head bandaged and nursing &quot;a broken hand&quot;.

In 2018 the band again toured in Europe, including an orchestral show at the London Palladium on 9 October. They commenced 2019 with a Caribbean cruise hosted by Justin Hayward, with many well-known rock acts. A US tour was due to follow.

=== Brooker&#x27;s death ===
Brooker, the only constant member of the band and the main songwriter, died on 19 February 2022. The band&#x27;s website described him as &quot;a brightly shining, irreplaceable light in the music industry&quot;. &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; entered the UK Official Singles Sales Chart Top 100 at number 38 on 25 February 2022. After his death, Procol Harum disbanded for good.

== Authorship lawsuit ==
In July 2009, Matthew Fisher won a British court judgment awarding him 40% of the music royalties from 2005 onwards for 1967&#x27;s &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot;, which had previously gone 50% to Brooker for the music and 50% to Reid for the lyrics.

<text>Universal Studios, Inc. (formerly as MCA Inc., also known simply as Universal) is an American media and entertainment conglomerate and holding company which owns Universal Pictures and other media and entertainment assets. It is the film production arm of NBCUniversal, a division of Comcast. The company is one of two namesake flagship subsidiaries of NBCUniversal alongside the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), the oldest of the United States&#x27; Big Three television networks. 

Originally founded in 1924 as Music Corporation of America by Jules C. Stein and William R. Goodheart Jr., the company became a major force in the film industry, and later expanded into television production. MCA published music, booked acts, ran a record company, represented film, television, and radio stars, and eventually produced and sold television programs to the three major television networks, especially corporate sibling NBC. Its studios are located in Universal City, California, and its corporate offices are located in New York City.

==History==

===Early years===
Universal Studios was formed in 1924 by Jules Stein and William R. Goodheart, Jr., as Music Corporation of America, a music booking agency based in Chicago, Illinois. MCA helped pioneer modern practices of touring bands and name acts. Early on, MCA booked such prominent artists as King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton for clubs and speakeasies run by legendary notorious Chicago mobsters such as Al Capone and others.

Lew Wasserman joined MCA in 1936 at the age of 23 and rose through the ranks of MCA for more than four decades, with Sonny Werblin as his right-hand man. Wasserman helped create MCA&#x27;s radio show, &quot;Kay Kyser&#x27;s Kollege of Musical Knowledge&quot;, which debuted on NBC Radio that same year. Following that success, Stein installed Wasserman in New York City in 1937, but Wasserman convinced him that Hollywood was the best place for the company&#x27;s growth.

=== &quot;The Rules of the Road&quot; ===

The company was guided by a codification of Stein&#x27;s pet policies known as &quot;The Rules of The Road&quot;. The Rules were passed down from the Prohibition era, Chicago–area MCA (referenced in books like &quot;Citizen Cohn&quot; and &quot;The King and Queen of Hollywood&quot;) to the 1940s Los Angeles–area firm, which focused on representing movie actors.

The Rules were next passed to the 1950s generation of MCA talent agents, including Jerry Perenchio, who later owned and headed a number of businesses including Univision from 1992 to 2007. Perenchio was well known for his version of the Rules (up to twenty rules), which varied from year to year and had some internal contradictions (In 2006, Perenchio pointed out that while there was a &quot;no nepotism&quot; rule, he was aware his son was on the company&#x27;s board of directors at the time).

=== Move to Hollywood: &quot;The Octopus&quot; ===
In 1939, based on Wasserman&#x27;s recommendation, MCA&#x27;s headquarters moved from Chicago to Beverly Hills, California, creating a movie division. The company began to acquire talent agencies, representing established actors such as James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Bette Davis, Jane Wyman and Ronald Reagan, whom Wasserman became very close with personally. In later decades, Wasserman became a guiding force in Reagan&#x27;s political ambition by helping Reagan to win the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), then election as Governor of California in 1966, and finally President of the United States in 1980.

By the end of the 1930s, MCA had become the largest talent agency in the world, with over 700 clients, including movie stars, recording artists, Broadway actors, radio stars, and directors. The company&#x27;s aggressive acquisition of clientele in all entertainment sectors earned MCA the nickname of &quot;The Octopus&quot;. The company&#x27;s activities led U.S. Department of Justice agents to investigate not only whether MCA was a monopoly breaking antitrust laws, but also its suspected connections to underworld criminal activities. This investigation continued for the next few decades.

===Revue Productions and the early days of television===
In 1948, Jules Stein moved up as MCA&#x27;s first chairman, giving Lew Wasserman charge of day-to-day operations of the company as president. That year, Stein and Wasserman decided to get into a new medium that would soon change the entertainment industry: television. Although many motion picture studios would not touch this new medium, thinking it was just a fad and would fade away, MCA decided to embrace it. First, however, the company needed to get a waiver from the Screen Actors Guild, which ruled at the time that talent agencies such as MCA were prohibited from producing TV shows or films. Thanks to the newly elected SAG president, Ronald Reagan (an MCA client), MCA was granted a waiver to start producing TV shows.

After the waiver was granted, the company formed MCA Television Limited for syndication. In 1950, Revue Productions, once a live concert promotion division that produced &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; live events for the USO during World War II, was re-launched as MCA&#x27;s television production subsidiary. By 1956, Revue became the top supplier of television for all broadcast networks, spanning three decades of television programs such as &quot;Armour Theater&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;, &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, and many others. Prior to 1958, all Revue&#x27;s shows were filmed at the old Republic Pictures studio lot in Studio City, California.

In February 1958, MCA acquired Paramount Pictures&#x27; pre-1950 sound feature film library for $10 million, through a newly created MCA subsidiary, EMKA, Ltd.

In December 1958, MCA bought the Universal Studios lot from Universal Pictures for $11,250,000 and renamed it, as well as the actual television unit, Revue Studios. As part of the deal, MCA leased the studios back to Universal for $2 million a year, plus unlimited access to MCA&#x27;s clients such as Jimmy Stewart, Rock Hudson, Doris Day and Alfred Hitchcock to make films for Universal.

Stein, who by this time was the sole owner of MCA, decided to take the company public by giving 51% of his ownership of MCA to his employees, which included a 20% stake for Wasserman. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange and was incorporated as MCA Inc. on November 10, 1958. A couple of years later, Alfred Hitchcock gave MCA his rights to &quot;Psycho&quot; and his television anthology in exchange for 150,000 shares, making him the third largest investor in MCA, and his own boss at Universal.

===Takeovers of Universal Pictures and Decca Records===
On June 18, 1962, Decca Records shareholders agreed to MCA&#x27;s buyout offer after the record label had entered into talks about a merger that April. Decca at the time owned Coral Records and Brunswick Records, and an 89% stake in Universal Pictures Company, Inc.

On July 13, 1962, the United States Department of Justice filed suit against MCA, charging that its acquisition of Decca&#x27;s controlling interest in Universal violated antitrust laws. In order to retain Universal, MCA would have to close its talent agency, which represented most of the industry&#x27;s biggest names (a select few handled by Wasserman personally). In reality, MCA&#x27;s talent agency arm became defunct the day the DOJ filed the suit; dissolving it that October was a mere formality.

MCA&#x27;s now-former agents quickly formed new agencies, many of which are woven into the corporate fabric of today&#x27;s talent management; Jerry Perenchio&#x27;s Chartwell Artists represented Elizabeth Taylor and Muhammad Ali. Former MCA agents Freddie Fields and David Begelman formed Creative Management Associates, another important new agency.

By the end of 1962, MCA assumed full ownership of Universal.

In 1964, MCA entered the music publishing business when it acquired Lou Levy&#x27;s Leeds Music, and formed Universal City Studios the same year in effort to merge under one umbrella both Universal Pictures and its Revue Studios division, which was later reincorporated as Universal Television in 1966.

On July 15, 1964, MCA established the Studio Tour, which provided guests a behind-the-scenes glimpse of film and television production at Universal Studios. This established a footprint of what is now known as Universal Studios Hollywood theme park. Over the next few decades, similar parks were built and expanded under MCA for Universal Orlando Resort in Orlando, Florida and Universal Studios Japan in Osaka.

In 1966, MCA formed Uni Records in Hollywood, California, and in 1967, MCA bought New York–based Kapp Records. That same year MCA also acquired guitar maker Danelectro and mall retailer Spencer Gifts.

===Further expansion===
In 1967, the MCA Records label was established outside the United States and Canada to issue releases by the MCA group of labels. Decca, Kapp, and Uni were merged into MCA Records at Universal City, California in 1971; the three labels maintained their identities for a short time but were soon retired in favor of the MCA label. The first MCA Records release in the US was former Uni artist Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Crocodile Rock&quot; in 1972. In 1973, the final Decca pop label release, &quot;Drift Away&quot;, a #5 pop hit by Dobie Gray, was issued.

MCA had two failed mergers in 1969. Initially, it planned a merger with Westinghouse Electric Corporation but that collapsed in April, and in July, they announced a proposed merger with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, but this too was called off in September.

In 1973, Stein stepped down from the company he founded and Wasserman took over as chairman and chief executive officer, while Sidney Sheinberg was appointed president and chief operating officer of MCA. Other executives within MCA were Lawrence R. Barnett, who ran the agency&#x27;s live acts division during its glory agency years in the 1950s and 1960s, and Ned Tanen, head of Universal Pictures. Tanen was behind Universal hits such as &quot;Animal House&quot;, and John Hughes&#x27;s &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot; and &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;.

MCA issued soundtrack albums for most films released by Universal Pictures.

In 1975, the company entered the book publishing business with the acquisition of G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons. In 1979, it acquired ABC Records along with its subsidiaries Paramount Records, Impulse! Records, and Dot Records. ABC had acquired the Paramount and Dot labels when it purchased Gulf+Western&#x27;s record labels in 1974, then the parent company of Paramount Pictures.

From 1983 to 1989, Irving Azoff was chairman of MCA Records and is credited for turning around the fortunes of the label.

The Chess Records catalog was acquired from the remnants of Sugarhill in 1985. Motown Records was bought in 1988 (and sold to PolyGram in 1993). GRP Records (which became for some years MCA&#x27;s jazz music label and thus began managing the company&#x27;s jazz catalogue) and Geffen Records (which served as another mainstream music subsidiary) were acquired in 1990.

MCA also acquired other assets outside of the music industry. It became a shareholder in USA Network in 1981, eventually owning 50% of the network (the other half was owned by Paramount). In 1982, its publishing division, G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, bought Grosset &amp; Dunlap from Filmways. In 1984, MCA bought Walter Lantz Productions and its characters, including Woody Woodpecker. In 1985, MCA bought toy and video game company LJN. It also bought a TV station in New York City, WWOR-TV (renamed from WOR-TV), in 1987, from RKO General subsidiary of GenCorp, which was in the midst of a licensing scandal.

In 1982, MCA decided to start out its video game unit, MCA Video Games, led by technicians of the MCA DiscoVision unit.

In 1983, MCA Videogames, the video game division of MCA itself and video game developer/publisher Atari Inc. entered into a partnership to start out Studio Games, a joint venture that would develop video games based on MCA&#x27;s film and television properties, most notably from then-sister Universal Pictures, and decided that they would give them access to all motion picture and television properties coming from the unit.

In 1990, MCA hired Hanna-Barbera executive Jeff Segal in order to start out its MCA Family Entertainment arm (aka Universal Family Entertainment) and had Universal Cartoon Studios as its subsidiary.

=== Later years as Universal Studios, Inc. ===
On November 26, 1990, Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. agreed to acquire MCA for US$6.59 billion. MCA was forced to sell New York City&#x27;s WWOR-TV in 1991 to Pinelands, Inc. because of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules that foreign companies could not own over 25% of a U.S. TV station.

In 1995, Seagram acquired 80% of MCA from Matsushita. On November 26, 1996, MCA announced that it would acquire television syndication company Multimedia Entertainment from Gannett, who acquired its parent company in 1995, for $40 million.

On December 9, 1996, the new owners dropped the MCA name; the company became Universal Studios, Inc. and MCA&#x27;s music division, MCA Music Entertainment Group, was renamed Universal Music Group. MCA Records continued to live on as a label within the Universal Music Group. The following year, G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons was sold to the Penguin Group subsidiary of Pearson PLC.

In 1996, Universal Studios filed a lawsuit against Viacom over the latter&#x27;s launch of the TV Land cable network. Viacom had purchased Paramount in 1994, and the contract for USA Network prohibited either of their owners from owning cable channels outside the joint venture. Viacom had owned MTV Networks (the parent of TV Land) since 1985. The suit was settled when Viacom sold MCA its half of the joint venture. TV Land eventually added shows from the MCA/Universal library in 1999.

=== Vivendi and NBCUniversal ===
To raise money, Seagram head Edgar Bronfman Jr. sold Universal&#x27;s television holdings, including cable network USA, to Barry Diller (these same properties would be bought back later at greatly inflated prices). In June 2000, Seagram was sold to French water utility and media company Vivendi, which owned StudioCanal; the conglomerate then became known as Vivendi Universal.

In the spring of 2003, MCA Records was folded into Geffen Records. Its country music label, MCA Nashville Records, is still in operation. MCA&#x27;s classical music catalog is managed by Deutsche Grammophon.

Burdened with debt, in 2004, Vivendi Universal sold 80% of Vivendi Universal Entertainment (including the studio and theme parks) to General Electric (GE), parent of NBC. However, the sale of Universal to NBC and GE did not include Universal Music Group, which had been a part of the film company since 1962. UMG was placed under separate management through Vivendi. The resulting company was named NBCUniversal, while Universal Studios Inc. remained the name of the production subsidiary. After that deal, GE owned 80% of NBC Universal; Vivendi held the remaining 20%, with an option to sell its share in 2006.

In late 2005, Viacom&#x27;s Paramount Pictures acquired DreamWorks SKG after acquisition talks between GE and DreamWorks stalled. Universal&#x27;s long-time chairperson, Stacey Snider, left the company in early 2006 to head up DreamWorks. Snider was replaced by then-Vice chairman Marc Shmuger and Focus Features head David Linde. On October 5, 2009, Marc Shmuger and David Linde were ousted, and their co-chairperson jobs were consolidated under former president of worldwide marketing and distribution Adam Fogelson, becoming the single chairperson. Donna Langley was also upped to co-chairperson. In 2009, Stephanie Sperber founded Universal Partnerships &amp; Licensing within Universal to license consumer products for Universal. GE purchased Vivendi&#x27;s share in NBCUniversal in 2011.

=== Comcast ===
GE sold 51% of the company to cable provider Comcast in 2011. Comcast merged the former GE subsidiary with its own cable-television programming assets, creating the current NBCUniversal. Following Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval, the Comcast-GE deal was closed on January 29, 2011. In March 2013, Comcast bought the remaining 49% of NBCUniversal for $16.7 billion.

<text>Kirby Muxloe is a large village and civil parish that forms part of the Blaby district of Leicestershire, England. Located to the west of Leicester, its proximity to the city has resulted in its inclusion in the Leicester Urban Area. The Leicester Forest East parish border runs along the Hinckley Road A47. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 4,523, which had increased to 4,667 at the 2011 census.

==History==
The name &quot;Kirby&quot; comes from the Dane Caeri who established the community here in the late ninth or early tenth century. The settlement was known as Carbi, and then later Kirby. The village was recorded in the Domesday book as &#x27;Carbi&#x27;. (Caeri&#x27;s settlement) with a working population of 8. At the time the land in Kirby Muxloe was owned by Hugh de Grandesmaynel and by William Peverel.
In 1461, William Hastings, the 1st Baron Hastings of Hungerford, became the Steward of the Honor of Leicester and Ranger of Leicester Forest. His father, Sir Leonard Hastings, had owned a modest estate in Leicestershire and Gloucestershire, where the family had long been established. On 14 April 1474 Hastings acquired the manorial right to Kirby from the Pakeman family, although he had rented it for some years previous to this. In 1480 he began to build the moated Kirby Muxloe Castle during the period of the Wars of the Roses. However, work on the castle stopped soon after Lord Hastings was executed on 13 June 1483 on the orders of Richard, Duke of Gloucester (days later to become King Richard III) at the Tower of London for conspiracy. William was caught up in the rivalry for the throne after the death of Edward IV.

In 1582 the name of the village is recorded as Kirby Muckelby, with variants Mullox, Muckle. About 50 years later in 1628 disafforestation of Leicester Forest occurred, effectively dividing the land near Kirby Muxloe into forest and pasture. The results are visible today. In 1636, the Hastings families sold the castle, and estates in Kirby and Braunstone, to the Winstanley family. The first official use of Kirby Muxloe was in 1703 in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Placenames&quot;, which states that &#x27;Muxloe&#x27; is a family name. There was such a family but they lived three miles away, in the village of Desford.

An early Quaker, John Penford, was a substantial resident of Kirby Muxloe and member of the Leicester Quarterly Meeting. A business meeting of the Society held at his home to consult on works of charity in 1670 was interrupted by informers, with the result that Penford and others were heavily fined.

The railway came to Kirby Muxloe in 1848 when the Midland Railway built a line through Kirby, and on 1 July 1859 Kirby Muxloe railway station opened at Kirby fields. (The station closed on 7 September 1964 as part of the Beeching cuts). In 1882, the fields known as Far and Near Townsend Close were bought by Kirby Muxloe Land Society. Barwell Road, Castle Road, and Church Road were laid out for the village and building went on over the next 30 years.
In 1911, Kirby Muxloe Castle was handed over to the Office of Works. It is now in the care of English Heritage. In 1941, during World War II, the village was heavily bombed. A German bomber returning from an attack on Coventry emptied its load on two streets, destroying the Free Church and several houses. Gaps left in the houses can still be seen.

The village has a primary school which is rated as one of the top schools in the county. There is a chemist, bakery, supermarket, two pubs, a popular sports and social club and a golf club.

Many people who lived there during the late 20th century were born in either a small maternity home in Station Road, near Barwell Road or Roundhill Maternity Home (NHS) in Hastings Road, Kirby Fields. Both are now private residences, as they were before they became Maternity Homes. What was the nurses&#x27; home at the entrance to Roundhill is now also a private residence.

<doc id="177272" wikidata="Q71787" url="?curid=177272" title="Widespread Panic">
<text>Widespread Panic is an American rock band from Athens, Georgia. The current lineup includes guitarist/singer John Bell, bassist Dave Schools, drummer Duane Trucks, percussionist Domingo &quot;Sunny&quot; Ortiz, keyboardist John &quot;JoJo&quot; Hermann, and guitarist Jimmy Herring. The band&#x27;s original guitarist and sometime songwriter, Michael Houser, died of pancreatic cancer in 2002, and the original drummer, Todd Nance, left in 2016 and died in 2020.

The band was formed in Athens in 1986, and is influenced by southern rock, blues rock, progressive rock, funk and hard rock genres. They have been compared to other jam bands including the Grateful Dead and Phish. Widely renowned for their live performances, they have held the record for number of sold-out performances at Red Rocks Amphitheatre and State Farm Arena in Atlanta.

==Band history==

===1981–1995: early years and rise to national attention===
John Bell and Michael Houser met in 1981 in their dorm at the University of Georgia in Athens. Bell had been playing guitar as a solo act and invited his new friend Houser, also a guitarist, to join him. They roomed together and collaborating on music in 1961, writing still-popular songs such as &quot;Driving Song&quot; and &quot;Chilly Water&quot; together. Bassist Dave Schools met Bell and Houser in 1984 and first played with them on February 24, 1985, at an A-Frame house on Weymanda Court in Athens. On February 6, 1986, Houser called Todd Nance, a drummer and his childhood friend, to sit in with Houser, Bell, and Schools for a charity event in Athens. It was their first show as &quot;Widespread Panic.&quot; The band was named for Houser&#x27;s once frequent panic attacks. Texan percussionist Domingo S. Ortiz (&quot;Sunny&quot;) began sitting in with the band regularly later that year.

The band played in fraternities and bars regularly before Widespread Panic signed a contract with Landslide Records in 1987. In February 1987 the band played the now-legendary series of one dollar Monday night shows at the Uptown Lounge in Athens and the crucial local press began to take notice. Shan Clark, a Flagpole and Athens Observer art columnist emphasized Widespread Panic&#x27;s musical virtuosity, songwriting, and professionalism. In September 1987, they recorded their first album, &quot;Space Wrangler&quot;, at John Keane&#x27;s studio in Athens. Col. Bruce Hampton is rumored to have delivered the first pressing to the band. Songs on the album include &quot;Chilly Water&quot;, &quot;Travelin&#x27; Light&quot;, &quot;Space Wrangler&quot;, &quot;Coconut&quot;, &quot;The Take Out&quot;, &quot;Porch Song&quot;, &quot;Stop-Go&quot;, and &quot;Driving Song.&quot; After &quot;Space Wrangler&quot;, touring expanded to include additional northeastern dates, along with Texas, Colorado, the west coast, and Vancouver, Canada. About this time (late 1988 or early 1989) Domingo Ortiz joined the band full-time. They played their first show in Colorado in March 1990, opening for Jerry Joseph&#x27;s band Little Women.

Widespread Panic signed with Capricorn Records in January 1991. Later that year, they released their major label debut, &quot;Widespread Panic&quot; (a.k.a. Mom&#x27;s Kitchen). In the same year, Billy Bob Thornton directed the movie &quot;Widespread Panic: Live from the Georgia Theatre&quot; which was recorded over two nights in Athens. As the band began touring more often, John Hermann (&quot;JoJo&quot;) joined the band as a keyboardist in March 1992 replacing Dixie Dregs keyboardist T. Lavitz who had been with the band a year. The band continued to tour throughout the entire US in 1992 joining the famous H.O.R.D.E. tour with Blues Traveler, Phish, and the Aquarium Rescue Unit, among others. They released &quot;Everyday&quot; in March 1993 and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Life Grand&quot; in September 1994. Widespread Panic marked their rise playing on network television for the first time in November 1994.

===1996–2002: peak touring years and Houser&#x27;s death===
On April 18, 1998, to celebrate the release of their first live album, &quot;Light Fuse, Get Away&quot;, Widespread Panic offered a free &quot;CD release party&quot; concert in Athens. An estimated 80,000–100,000 fans descended on the city, transforming it into one of the largest CD release parties in history. In 2002, the band received gold certification for their concert DVD &quot;Live at Oak Mountain&quot;. They headlined two nights of the first annual Bonnaroo Music Festival which drew a crowd upwards of 70,000 people.

In early 2002, guitarist Michael Houser was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Houser continued to perform with the band into the middle of that year, but after a performance on July 2, 2002, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa he left the tour because of declining health. Guitarist George McConnell, a former bandmate of JoJo Hermann&#x27;s in Beanland, took over as lead guitarist for the remainder of the band&#x27;s scheduled dates. Houser died on August 10, 2002.

===2003–2006: George McConnell joins===
In 2003, the band released &quot;Ball&quot;, the first studio album with McConnell as the guitarist. The album was unique among the band&#x27;s offerings in that none of the songs included had been performed live by the band prior to the recording. All of the material included was written specifically for the album with the exception of &quot;Time Waits&quot;, a song which John Bell had performed in solo appearances, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Lose You&quot;, a song John Hermann had performed with his side-project Smiling Assassins. Late in 2003, the band announced that they would be taking a hiatus from both recording and performing in 2004. However, they released three live albums in 2004, engineered by Billy Field: &quot;Night of Joy&quot; and &quot;Über Cobra&quot;—both of which were recorded during a November 2003 three-night run of shows at the House of Blues in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina—as well as &quot;Jackassolantern&quot;, a compilation of cover songs performed during the band&#x27;s Halloween shows over the years. A third release from the Myrtle Beach shows, &quot;Live at Myrtle Beach&quot; was released in early 2005.

In January 2006, the band recorded their 9th studio album, &quot;Earth to America, &quot;in Nassau, The Bahamas at Compass Point Studios, with Terry Manning producing. It was released June 13, 2006. Their May 9 show at Atlanta&#x27;s Fox Theatre was simulcast in Live HD, via satellite, in select movie theatres nationwide. Over 60,000 fans across the country watched it live in the theatres. The show was also released in DVD format on November 14, 2006, entitled &quot;Earth to Atlanta&quot;. On August 2, 2006, near the end of the summer tour, the band announced that George McConnell had left the band, making July 30, 2006 at the Fox Theatre in St. Louis, his last show. Producer John Keane and former guitar technician Sam Holt filled in on guitar for the remaining two weeks of the tour.

===2006–2014: Jimmy Herring joins===
In late 2006, Jimmy Herring from Fayetteville, North Carolina, joined the band as lead guitarist. His began a fall tour with three nights at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Widespread Panic&#x27;s 7th annual New Year&#x27;s shows on December 30 and 31, 2007, marked their 15th and 16th sellout performance at Philips Arena. The band released their 10th album, &quot;Free Somehow&quot;, on February 12, 2008. It, too, was recorded with producer Terry Manning at Compass Point Studios.

After the release of the new studio album, Widespread Panic began to release vintage concert performances from the Widespread Panic Archives. &quot;Carbondale 2000&quot; was released on June 10, 2008, followed by &quot;Valdosta 1989&quot; released on February 24, 2009, and &quot;Huntsville 1996&quot; which came out on June 23, 2009. The band plans to continue to dig into their show archives and release songs from the shows as multi-track recordings. June 27, 2008, marked the band&#x27;s 32nd sold-out show at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. The audience was larger than that for any other band in the venue&#x27;s history. Mayor John Hickenlooper proclaimed Friday, June 27 &quot;Widespread Panic Day&quot; in the city and county of Denver. In the same year, the band was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame on September 20.

They toured for the rest of 2008 and the spring of 2009. In the summer of 2009, Widespread Panic teamed with fellow southern rockers, The Allman Brothers on a summer and fall co-headlining tour. In March 2010, it was announced that Widespread Panic would be releasing a new album entitled &quot;Dirty Side Down&quot; on May 25, 2010. &quot;Live in the Classic City II&quot;, containing music from its 2000 shows, came out in 2010. On September 29, 2010, Widespread Panic keyboardist Jojo Herman announced that the band would be going on hiatus in 2012. In an interview with &quot;The Vanderbilt Hustler&quot;, Herman said, &quot;Next year will be our 25th anniversary. After that, we&#x27;re probably going to call it (quits) for a while... we&#x27;re looking forward to next year and going out on a high note.&quot;

The band toured steadily throughout 2011, ending the year with their first show at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina. In early 2012, the band played a limited number of shows. From January to February they went on their first completely acoustic tour. Dubbed the Wood Tour, it began in January at the Fillmore in downtown Silver Spring, Maryland and ended at The Belly Up in Aspen, Colorado. Two recordings from the tour were released in 2012, a special Record Store Day-only vinyl record called &quot;Live Wood&quot; in April and later &quot;Wood&quot;, on October 16.

For the rest of 2012 the band was on hiatus but band members were active with other projects. Dave Schools toured with the Mickey Hart Band, Jimmy Herring recorded a new album and toured with his own band, and Jojo Hermann played shows with the Missing Cats, occasionally opening and sitting in with the North Mississippi Allstars. On August 17, the band announced their first scheduled shows after the hiatus, including two nights in Charlotte and a four night run in the Dominican Republic. Between the two short legs of the 2012 Wood Tour, the band played a four night run in Mexico, their first shows in the country, and beginning what became an annual tradition called Panic en la Playa. The first Panic En La Playa was held on the beach at the Now Sapphire Resort in Puerto Morelos, Mexico in 2012. For 2013 and 2014, The concert was held at the Hard Rock Hotel in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic with the 2014 shows pushed back until March 17–20.

The band returned to touring in the spring of 2013 with a run of Mid-West and Southern shows beginning in April. During the shows, the band introduced new innovations in the audio broadcast of their live performances. Previously, Widespread Panic had allowed fans to use audience recording devices to simulcast live shows to fans via the internet. The first live taper stream was at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix in November 2009 and continued through the spring 2013 tour when the band took over streaming duties and started broadcasting live soundboard recordings of the show via Mixlr.com and the Mixlr smartphone app. On December 31, 2013, the band returned to Philips Arena in Atlanta.

The Wood Tour came back in 2014 with the band playing six all acoustic theater shows, as well as a special Wood performance held 333 feet underground in the Volcano Room at Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville, Tennessee for a taping of an episode of &quot;Bluegrass Underground&quot; on PBS The band played an extensive 2014 tour, with three-night stands at Red Rocks, The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas; The Riverside Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado, where they played their well-known Halloween shows. The band closed out 2014 with the annual Tunes for Tots benefit performance at The Fillmore in Charlotte on December 30th, followed by an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve show, held at the TWC Arena in the city.

===2014–present: Todd Nance departure, reduced touring and Nance&#x27;s death===
On October 2, 2014, the band announced that Duane Trucks would join the band for the 2014 fall tour. Trucks temporarily filled in for Todd Nance, who was taking personal time off. Nance reunited with the band for four shows in Mexico in early February 2016. However, on February 9, 2016, the band announced that Nance was leaving the band and that &quot;Duane [Trucks] will be the drummer for Widespread Panic moving forward.&quot; Prior to joining Widespread Panic, Trucks was the drummer for Hard Working Americans, whose lineup also included Widespread Panic bassist Dave Schools.

On September 25, 2015, &quot;Street Dogs&quot;, their 13th studio album, was released through Vanguard Records. &quot;Street Dogs&quot; was recorded by John Keane at Echo Mountain Recording Studio in Asheville, North Carolina. The album is composed of seven originals and three covers: Alan Price&#x27;s &quot;Sell Sell&quot;, Murray McLauchlan&#x27;s &quot;Honky Red&quot; and &quot;Tail Dragger&quot;, a Willie Dixon tune popularized by Howlin&#x27; Wolf. In April 2016, keyboardist John Hermann announced that Widespread Panic would stop touring extensively at the end of the year. However, he said that the band is not breaking up and will continue to make festival appearances and perform shows at select venues such as Red Rocks.

Nance died on August 19, 2020, in Athens, Georgia. He was 57; his death was first announced on Facebook by collaborator Cody Dickinson and was later confirmed by Relix, a magazine. Details on the chronic illness which led to his death were not disclosed.

==Live shows==

===Setlists for concerts===
Known for never playing the same show twice, the band utilizes a show-to-show method of choosing the night&#x27;s setlist. At the beginning of each tour, a member of the band&#x27;s road crew makes a master list of all the songs the band performs and laminates it. Each night before the show he marks the last three nights&#x27; set lists in different colors. The band is able to see what has been played recently and they decide what songs to play during the first set. They return to the list during a set break to pick songs for the second set, and likewise, return after the second set for any additional sets if they are playing more than two sets or the encore. The late Garrie Vereen talks about the unusual practice in the DVD &quot;The Earth Will Swallow You&quot;.

===Tapers===
Widespread Panic has a policy of allowing their fans to tape, trade, and to a limited extent freely distribute their shows. However, anonymous distribution such as P2P and commercial distribution is not permitted. Fans have been taping and trading shows since before they gained national prominence, allowing them to gain their strong national following.

===Incident===
A fan was detained by police while experiencing the effects of LSD after leaving a concert in Southaven, Mississippii. He was restrained and taken to a local hospital emergency room where he later died while still in police custody. On November 18, 2015, autopsy findings said that &#x27;hogtying&#x27; contributed to the death of the fan.

<doc id="177273" wikidata="Q233234" url="?curid=177273" title="Virginia Wade">
<text>Sarah Virginia Wade (born 10 July 1945) is a British former professional tennis player. She won three major tennis singles championships and four major doubles championships, and is the only British woman in history to have won titles at all four majors. She was ranked as high as No. 2 in the world in singles, and No. 1 in the world in doubles.

Wade was the most recent British tennis player to win a major singles tournament until Andy Murray won the 2012 US Open, and was the most recent British woman to have won a major singles title until Emma Raducanu won the 2021 US Open. After retiring from competitive tennis, she coached for four years, and has also worked as a tennis commentator and game analyst for the BBC and Eurosport, and (in the US) for CBS.

==Early life==
Wade was born in Bournemouth, England, UK, on 10 July 1945. Her father was the archdeacon of Durban.

At one year old, Wade moved to South Africa with her parents. There, she learned how to play tennis. When she was aged 15, the family moved back to England, and she went to Tunbridge Wells Girls&#x27; Grammar School and Talbot Heath School, Bournemouth. In 1961, she was on the tennis team of Wimbledon County Girls&#x27; Grammar School. She studied mathematics and physics at the University of Sussex, graduating in 1966.

==Tennis career==

Wade&#x27;s tennis career spanned the end of the amateur era and the start of the Open Era. In 1968, as an amateur, she won the inaugural open tennis competition – the British Hard Court Open at Bournemouth. She turned down the £300 first prize, choosing to play for expenses only. Five months later, after turning professional, she won the women&#x27;s singles championship at the first US Open (and prize-money of $6,000 - $ today), defeating Billie Jean King in the final. Her second Major tennis singles championship came in 1972 at the Australian Open when she defeated Australian Evonne Goolagong in the final 6–4, 6–4. She was appointed a member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1973 Birthday Honours for services to lawn tennis.

Wade won Wimbledon in 1977. It was the 16th year in which she had played at Wimbledon, and she secured her first appearance in the final by beating the defending champion Chris Evert in the semifinal 6–2, 4–6, 6–1. In the final, she beat Betty Stöve in three sets to claim the championship, nine days before her 32nd birthday. 1977 was the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Wimbledon Championships as well as the Silver Jubilee year of Elizabeth II, who attended the final for the first time since 1962.

Wade also won four Major women&#x27;s doubles championships with Margaret Smith Court – two of them at the US Open tennis tournament, one at the Australian Open, and one at the French Open. In 1983, at the age of 37, she won the Italian Open women&#x27;s doubles championship with Virginia Ruzici of Romania.

Over her career, Wade won 55 professional singles championships and amassed $1,542,278 in career prize money. She was ranked in the world&#x27;s top 10 continuously from 1967 to 1979. Her career spanned a total of 26 years. She retired from singles competition at the end of the 1985 tennis season, and then from doubles at the end of 1986. She played at Wimbledon on 26 occasions, an all-time record; 24 of those times were in the women&#x27;s singles.

==After tennis==
Since 1981, while she was still playing, Wade has been a reporter on tennis events for the BBC. In 1982, she became the first woman to be elected to the Wimbledon Committee.

Wade was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1986 Birthday Honours for services to lawn tennis.

In 1989, Wade was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island.

==Grand Slam singles performance timeline==

Note: The Australian Open was held twice in 1977, in January and December.

==Personal life==

Wade has no children and has never married. She has said &quot;If I&#x27;d done better earlier, and my career had been at its peak earlier and I&#x27;d faded, I would probably have had a totally different life.&quot; She lives mostly in New York and in Chelsea, London.

She posed for sculptor David Wynne for the 17-foot-high fountain &quot;Girl with a Dolphin&quot;, installed at Tower Bridge in 1973.

<text>Alexander Raban Waugh (8 July 1898 – 3 September 1981) was a British novelist, the elder brother of the better-known Evelyn Waugh, uncle of Auberon Waugh and son of Arthur Waugh, author, literary critic and publisher. His first wife was Barbara Jacobs (1900-1996), daughter of the writer William Wymark Jacobs, his second wife was Joan Chirnside (1902-1969), and his third wife was Virginia Sorenson (1912-1991), author of the Newbery Medal-winning &quot;Miracles on Maple Hill&quot;.

==Biography==
Waugh was born in London to Arthur Waugh (1866-1943) and Catherine Charlotte Raban, a great-granddaughter of Lord Cockburn (1779–1854). Another distinguished ancestor was his great-great-grandfather  William Morgan FRS (1750–1833), a pioneer of actuarial science who served The Equitable Life Assurance Society for 56 years and who won the Copley Medal in 1789. Among ancestors bearing the Waugh name, the Rev. Alexander Waugh D.D. (1754–1827) was a minister in the Secession Church of Scotland who helped found the London Missionary Society and was one of the leading Nonconformist preachers of his day. His grandson Alexander Waugh (1840–1906) was a country medical practitioner, who bullied his wife and children and became known in the Waugh family as &quot;the Brute&quot;. The elder of Alexander&#x27;s two sons, born in 1866, was Alec&#x27;s father, Arthur.

Alec was educated at Sherborne School, a public school in Dorset. The result of his experiences was his first, semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;The Loom of Youth&quot; (July 1917), in which he dramatised his schooldays. The book was inspired by Arnold Lunn&#x27;s &quot;The Harrovians&quot;, published in 1913 and discussed at some length in &quot;The Loom of Youth.&quot;

&quot;The Loom of Youth&quot; was so controversial at the time (it mentioned homosexual relationships between boys, albeit in a very understated, staid fashion) that Waugh remains the only former pupil to be dismissed from the old boys&#x27; society (The Old Shirburnian Society). It was also a best seller. (The Society&#x27;s website gives a different version: Alec and his father resigned and were not reinstated until 1933, while Evelyn went to a different school). Robert Graves wrote in a letter sent from Liverpool to his friend Siegfried Sassoon, dated 9 September 1917, “That “Loom of Youth” book is amazingly good: I might have written it myself – no that sounds wrong but you understand: what a reckless man to write and publish it ! He is old Gosse’s nephew or something and Gosse was very shy about it till he heard that it was in its fifth edition when he changed his tune.” In 1932, the book was again the subject of controversy when Wyndham Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Doom of Youth&quot; seemed to suggest that Waugh&#x27;s interest in schoolboys was because he was a homosexual. This was settled out of court. In the mid-1960s, Alec donated the original manuscript, press clippings and correspondence with the publisher to the Society.

Waugh served in the British army in France during the First World War, being commissioned in the Dorset Regiment in May 1917, and seeing action at Passchendaele. Captured by the Germans near Arras in March 1918, he spent the rest of the war in prisoner-of-war camps in Karlsruhe and in the Mainz Citadel. Waugh married his first wife, Barbara Annis Jacobs (1900–1996), in 1919.

He later had a career as a successful author, although never as successful or innovative as that of his younger brother. He lived much of his life overseas, in exotic places such as Tangier – a lifestyle made possible by his second marriage in 1932 to a rich Australian, Joan Chirnside, only child and heiress of Andrew Spence Chirnside (1856-1934) of Edrington, Berwick, Victoria and Vite Vite, Derrinallum, Victoria, nephew of Thomas Chirnside of Werribee Park. His work, possibly in consequence, tended to be reminiscent of W. Somerset Maugham, although without achieving Maugham&#x27;s huge popular success. Nevertheless, his 1955 novel &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; was a best-seller. It was filmed in 1957 as &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;, securing from Hollywood the greatest amount ever paid for the use of a novel at that time. His 1973 novel &quot;A Fatal Gift&quot; was also a success. Despite these successes, his waggish nephew Auberon once joked that Waugh &quot;wrote many books, each worse than the last.&quot;

Waugh served in the British army during the Second World War as an Intelligence Officer. He was posted to France (serving under Gerald Wellesley, his Hampshire neighbour), Syria, the Lebanon, Egypt, and Iraq, ending the War with the rank of Major.

He was a wine connoisseur, and published &quot;In Praise of Wine &amp; Certain Noble Spirits&quot; (1959), a light-hearted and discursive guide to the major wine types, and &quot;Wines and Spirits&quot;, a 1968 book in the Time-Life series &quot;Foods of the World&quot;.
In 1969, Waugh married the author Virginia Sorensen, and they resided together in Morocco, then moved to the United States as his health failed. He died in Florida at the age of 83.

<doc id="177276" wikidata="Q1780037" url="?curid=177276" title="The Youngbloods">
<text>The Youngbloods was an American rock band consisting of Jesse Colin Young (vocals, bass, guitar), Jerry Corbitt (vocals, guitar, keyboards, harmonica), Lowell &quot;Banana&quot; Levinger (guitar and electric piano), and Joe Bauer (drums). Despite receiving critical acclaim, they never achieved widespread popularity. Their only U.S. Top 40 entry was Chet Powers&#x27; &quot;Get Together&quot;.

==Band history==
===Background and formation===
Jesse Colin Young (born Perry Miller, November 22, 1941, Queens, New York) was a moderately successful folk singer with two LPs – &quot;Soul of a City Boy&quot; (1964) and &quot;Youngblood&quot; (1965) – when he met fellow folk singer and former bluegrass musician from Cambridge, Massachusetts, Jerry Corbitt (born Jerry Byron Corbitt, January 7, 1943, Tifton, Georgia). When in town, Young would drop in on Corbitt, and the two played together exchanging harmonies.

Beginning in January 1965, the two began performing on the Canadian circuit as a duo, eventually adopting the name &quot;The Youngbloods&quot;. Young played bass, and Corbitt sang and played piano, harmonica and lead guitar. Corbitt introduced Young to a bluegrass musician, Lowell Levinger (born Lowell Vincent Levinger III, September 9, 1944, Manhattan, New York City). Levinger, known as &quot;Banana&quot;, could play the piano, banjo, mandolin, mandola, guitar and bass; he had played in the Proper Bostonians and the Trolls, and played mainly piano and guitar in the Youngbloods. He knew of a fellow tenant who could flesh out the band, Joe Bauer (born September 26, 1941, Memphis, Tennessee), an aspiring jazz drummer with experience playing in society dance bands.

===Small gigs to recording success===
Once the line-up was set, Jesse Colin Young and the Youngbloods, as the group was then known, began building a reputation from their club dates. (Early demo sides from 1965 were later issued by Mercury Records on the &quot;Two Trips&quot; album.) Their first concert had been at Gerde&#x27;s Folk City in Greenwich Village; months later, they were the house band at the Cafe Au Go Go and had signed a recording contract with RCA Victor. Young, however, was not satisfied with RCA.

The arrangement produced one charting single, &quot;Grizzly Bear&quot; (number 52 in 1967). Several critically praised albums followed: &quot;The Youngbloods&quot; (1967, later retitled &quot;Get Together&quot;); &quot;Earth Music&quot; (1967); and &quot;Elephant Mountain&quot; (1969), with the track &quot;Darkness, Darkness&quot;.

In 1967, when the track &quot;Get Together&quot;, a paean to universal brotherhood, first appeared, it did not sell well, reaching only number 62 on the chart. But two years later – after Dan Ingram had recorded a brotherhood promotion for WABC-AM in which the song was used as a bed for the promotion, and after the National Council of Christians and Jews subsequently used the song in television and radio commercials – the track was re-released and cracked the Top 5. This disc sold over one million copies and received a gold record, awarded by the RIAA, on October 7, 1969.

Johnny Carson once reportedly refused to allow the band to perform on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, saying they were overly demanding during the pre-show soundcheck. In a 2009 interview, Young stated that the band refused to perform because the show reneged on a promise that they could play a song from their new album &quot;Elephant Mountain&quot;, instead demanding that they play only &quot;Get Together&quot;.

With Corbitt&#x27;s departure from the band (for a solo career) in 1969, before the band recorded the album &quot;Elephant Mountain&quot;, Levinger assumed lead guitar duties and played extensively on Wurlitzer electric piano. The band became adept at lengthy improvisations in their live performances (as captured on the albums &quot;Rock Festival&quot; and &quot;Ride the Wind&quot;, released after the band moved over to their own Raccoon label, distributed by Warner Brothers).

The group added the bassist Michael Kane to their lineup in 1971 and released two more albums: &quot;Good &amp; Dusty&quot; (1971), which featured &quot;Hippie from Olema&quot; (an answer to Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot;), and &quot;High on a Ridgetop&quot; (1972), before disbanding.

===Later history===
In 1971, Jerry Corbitt and former Youngbloods producer Charlie Daniels formed a band called Corbitt &amp; Daniels and toured. Young, Levinger and Bauer went on to solo careers; only Young had any notable success. Levinger, Bauer and Kane were part of another group, Noggins, in 1972, which released one album, &quot;Crab Tunes&quot;. Bauer died of a brain tumor in September 1982, at the age of 40.

Banana supplied guitar, banjo, synthesizer, and back-up vocals to Mimi Fariña&#x27;s 1985 solo album, &quot;Solo&quot;, and also toured with her on and off from 1973 until the 1990s. During the 1980s and 1990s, he played with the jam rock band Zero on keyboards, vocals and rhythm guitar.

In late 1984, the Youngbloods briefly reunited for a club tour. The 1984 line-up contained Young, Corbitt and Levinger, plus new members David Perper (drums, ex-Pablo Cruise) and Scott Lawrence (keyboards, woodwinds). Once the tour was completed, the group disbanded once again by mid-1985.

<doc id="177278" wikidata="Q309983" url="?curid=177278" title="Caetano Veloso">
<text>Caetano Emanuel Viana Teles Veloso (; born 7 August 1942) is a Brazilian composer, singer, guitarist, writer, and political activist. Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement Tropicália, which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the Brazilian military dictatorship that took power in 1964. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards. On 14 November, 2012, Veloso was honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.

Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of José Telles Veloso (commonly known as &quot;Seu Zeca&quot;), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Telles Veloso (known as &quot;Dona Canô&quot;). He was born in the city of Santo Amaro da Purificação, in Bahia, a state in northeastern Brazil, but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after that, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first label. He became one of the originators of Tropicália with several like-minded musicians and artists—including his sister Maria Bethânia—in the same period. However, the Brazilian military dictatorship viewed Veloso&#x27;s music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician Gilberto Gil, in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil and went to London where they lived for two years. In 1972, Veloso moved back to his home country and once again began recording and performing. He later became popular outside Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.

== Biography ==
Veloso was born in Santo Amaro da Purificação, Bahia, Brazil, the fifth of seven children of José Teles Veloso (1901–1983) and Claudionor Viana Teles Veloso (1907–2012). His childhood was influenced greatly by artistic endeavors: he was interested in both literature and filmmaking as a child, but focused mainly on music. The musical style of bossa nova and João Gilberto, one of its most prominent exponents, were major influences on Veloso&#x27;s music as he grew up. Veloso was 17 years old when he first heard Gilberto, whom he describes as his &quot;supreme master&quot;. He recognizes Gilberto&#x27;s contribution to Brazilian music as new—&quot;illuminating&quot; the tradition of Brazilian music and paving the way for future innovation. Veloso moved to the Bahian port city of Salvador as a teenager, the city in which Gilberto lived, and a center of Afro-Brazilian culture and music.

In 1965, Veloso moved again to Rio de Janeiro, with his sister Maria Bethânia, also a musician. Shortly after the move, Veloso won a lyrics contest for his composition &quot;Um Dia&quot; and was signed to Philips Records. On 21 October 1967, Veloso won fourth prize and gained a standing ovation at the third annual Brazil Popular Music Festival with his song &quot;Alegria, Alegria&quot;. on which he was backed by São Paulo group Beat Boys; along with the performance of his friend Gilberto Gil, who was backed by psychedelic band Os Mutantes, this marked the first time that rock bands had performed at the festival. During this period, Veloso, Bethânia, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Tom Zé, and Os Mutantes developed &quot;Tropicalismo&quot;, which fused Brazilian pop with rock and roll and avant-garde music. Veloso describes the movement as a wish to be different - not &quot;defensive&quot; like the right-wing Brazilian military government, which vehemently opposed the movement. Although Gil and Veloso&#x27;s performances at the 1967 MBP Festival were rapturously received, within a year, Tropicalismo had become a deeply divisive issue among Brazil&#x27;s youth audience, with Marxist-influenced college students of the Brazilian left wing condemning Tropicalismo, because they believed it commercialized Brazilian traditional music by incorporating musical influence from other cultures, specifically the United States.

The musical manifesto of the Tropicalist movement was the landmark collaborative LP &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis&quot; (&quot;Tropicalia: or Bread and Circuses&quot;), issued in mid-1968, which brought together the talents of Veloso, Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, Tom Zé and Gal Costa, with arrangements by avant-garde composer-arranger Rogerio Duprat (who had studied with Pierre Boulez) and lyrical contributions from poet Torquato Neto. The album&#x27;s group cover photograph depicted the collective holding a variety of objects and images, in a deliberate reference to the cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.

The tensions between the &quot;Tropicalistas&quot; and the student left peaked in September 1968 with Veloso&#x27;s now-legendary performances at the third annual International Song Festival, held at the Catholic University in Rio, where the audience included a large contingent of students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas. When Veloso (backed by Os Mutantes) performed in the first round of the Festival&#x27;s song competition on 12 September, he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause, but the situation soon turned ugly. Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, Veloso provoked the students with his lurid costume, his sensual body movements and his startling new psychedelic music, and the performers were soon being bombarded with loud insults, jeers and boos from the students, who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance on stage during the song.

The ideological conflict climaxed three days later on 15 September when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition, performing a specially-written new song entitled &quot;É Proibido Proibir&quot; (&quot;It is Forbidden to Forbid&quot;). The leftist students began hissing and booing as soon as Veloso&#x27;s name was announced, and when he began his performance, his overtly sexual stage moves and the experimental music of Os Mutantes again provoked a wild reaction – the students began booing so loudly that the performers could barely be heard, and a section of the crowd then stood up and turned their backs to the stage, prompting Os Mutantes to turn their backs on the audience. As the performance continued, the students pelted the stage with fruit, vegetables, eggs, paper balls and anything else that came to hand. Veloso then stopped singing and launched into an impassioned monologue, in which he excoriated the students for their conservatism. After being joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support, Veloso finished his diatribe by telling the students &quot;...if you are the same in politics as you are in aesthetics, we’re done for!&quot; and declaring he would no longer compete in music festivals. He then deliberately finished the song out of tune, angrily shouted &quot;Enough!&quot; and walked off arm-in-arm with Gil and Os Mutantes. A studio version of the song was later released as a single, and the closing section of the tumultuous live performance featuring Veloso&#x27;s speech, was issued as the single&#x27;s B-side. [103] Even though Tropicalismo was controversial among traditional critics, it introduced to Música popular brasileira new elements for making music with an eclectic style.

Veloso studied philosophy at the Universidade Federal da Bahia, which influenced both his artistic expression and viewpoint on life. Among his favorite philosophers were Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, and Herbert Marcuse. Veloso&#x27;s anti-authoritarian political stance earned him the enmity of Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship which ruled until 1985; his songs were frequently censored and some banned.

=== Imprisonment and exile ===
In October 1968, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil performed at Sucata club in Rio de Janeiro, with Hélio Oiticica&#x27;s poem-flag displayed on stage. The journalist of RecordTV propagated a story that Caetano and Gil had sung the Brazilian National Anthem in subversive parody. The two musicians were arrested without trial 27 December 1968—shortly after the military state had passed on 13 December Institutional Act Number Five, which suspended habeas corpus. On 23 January 1969, Veloso underwent interrogation by Major Hilton Justino Ferreira, who asked Caetano whether he had sung the national anthem of Brazil to the melody of &quot;Tropicália,&quot; to which Caetano responded that it would be impossible because the verses of the Brazilian anthem are decasyllable and the verses of &quot;Tropicalia&quot; only have eight poetic syllables. 

Veloso and Gil were both arrested in February 1969 and held in prison for three months, followed by a further four months under house arrest; they were eventually released on condition that they leave the country, and spent the next few years in exile. He said that &quot;they didn&#x27;t imprison us for any song or any particular thing that we said,&quot; ascribing the government&#x27;s reaction to its unfamiliarity with the cultural phenomenon of Tropicália—they seemed to say &quot;We might as well put them in prison.&quot; The federal police detained the two and flew them to an unknown destination. Finally, Veloso and Gil lived out their exile in London, England. When Caetano was asked about his experience there he says, &quot;London felt dark, and I felt far away from myself.&quot; Nevertheless, the two improved their music there and were asked to make a musical production with the producer Ralph Mace.

==Career==
=== Musical career (1972–present) ===
Veloso&#x27;s work upon his return in 1972 was often characterized by frequent merging not only of international styles but of Brazilian folkloric styles and rhythms as well. His popularity grew outside Brazil in the 1980s, especially in Greece, Portugal, France, and Africa. His records released in the United States, such as &quot;Estrangeiro&quot;, helped gain him a larger audience.

To celebrate 25 years of Tropicalismo, Veloso and Gilberto Gil released a CD called &quot;Tropicalia 2&quot; in 1993. One song, &quot;Haiti&quot;, attracted people&#x27;s attention during the time, especially because it included powerful statements about sociopolitical issues present in Haiti and also in Brazil. Issues addressed in the song included ethnicity, poverty, homelessness, and capital corruption in the AIDS pandemic. By 2004, he was one of the most respected and prolific international pop stars, with more than 50 recordings available including songs in film soundtracks of Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Eros&quot;, Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;Hable con ella&quot;, and &quot;Frida&quot;, for which he performed at the 75th Academy Awards but did not win. In 2002 Veloso published an account of his early years and the Tropicalismo movement, &quot;Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil&quot;.

His first all-English CD was &quot;A Foreign Sound&quot; (2004), which covers Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Come as You Are&quot; and compositions from the Great American Songbook such as &quot;Carioca&quot; (music by Vincent Youmans and lyrics by Edward Eliscu and Gus Kahn), &quot;Always&quot; (music and lyrics by Irving Berlin), &quot;Manhattan&quot; (music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart), &quot;Love for Sale&quot; (music and lyrics by Cole Porter), and &quot;Something Good&quot; (music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers). Six of the seven songs on his third eponymous album, released in 1971, were also in English.

Veloso has contributed songs to two AIDS benefit compilation albums produced by the Red Hot Organization: &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot; (1996) and &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot; (1998).

In 2011, he again contributed two songs to the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent compilation album, &quot;Red Hot + Rio 2&quot;. The two tracks include a remix of &quot;Terra&quot; by Prefuse 73 (&quot;3 Mellotrons in a Quiet Room Version&quot;) and &quot;Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses&quot;, in collaboration with David Byrne.

His September 2006 album, &quot;Cê&quot;, was released by Nonesuch Records in the United States. It won two Latin Grammy Awards, one for best singer-songwriter and one for Best Portuguese Song, &quot;Não Me Arrependo&quot;. 

With a total of nine Latin Grammy Awards and two Grammy Awards, Veloso has received more than any other Brazilian performer. On 14 November, 2012, Veloso was also honored as the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.

Veloso has been called &quot;one of the greatest songwriters of the century&quot; and &quot;a pop musician/poet/filmmaker/political activist whose stature in the pantheon of international pop musicians is on par with that of Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, and Lennon/McCartney&quot;.

In January 2016, Caetano Veloso was a featured artist at the convention of the Modern Language Association (MLA), in Austin, Texas. Before a SRO crowd, he was interviewed on stage by two luminaries in the field of poetry and poetics, Marjorie Perloff (emerita Stanford) and Roland Greene (Stanford, President of MLA at the time). Most of the discussion concerned music, from rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and samba to experimental composition. Videos of the event should be posted at MLA&#x27;s site and the Stanford Arcade site. He also performed &quot;Isto aqui, o que é?&quot; at the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony along with singers Anitta and Gilberto Gil after the parade of delegations in August 2016.

In May 2018, Veloso performed at the Grand Final of the 2018 Eurovision Song Contest in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, alongside 2017 winner Salvador Sobral. His live album &quot;Ofertório (Ao Vivo)&quot; (recorded with his sons Moreno, Zeca and Tom) was ranked as the 25th best Brazilian album of 2018 by the Brazilian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

In 2018 Veloso participated in Stefano Bollani album &quot;Que Bom&quot; with two songs: &quot;La nebbia a Napoli&quot; and &quot;Michelangelo Antonioni&quot;.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Veloso at number 108 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== Personal life ==
Veloso married fellow Baiana and actress Andrea Gadelha (or Dedé) on 21 November 1967, in a ceremony that reflected the style of the counterculture era. Their son Moreno was born on 22 November 1972. On 7 January 1979, their daughter Júlia was born 3 months premature; she died 11 days later. Veloso separated from Dedé Veloso in 1983. In 1986 Veloso married Rio native Paula Lavigne, with whom he had two more sons, Zeca Lavigne Veloso, born 7 March 1992, and Tom Lavigne Veloso, born on 25 January 1997, in Salvador. Paula confirmed to Playboy magazine in 1998 that, &quot;[Paula] was 13 years old when she lost her virginity to the musician, who was 40 years old at the time.&quot; Caetano has since been accused of pedophilia, as having sex with Paul would be considered statutory rape. This marriage lasted twenty years. After their separation in 2004, the two still worked together. In 2016, the couple reunited. Veloso&#x27;s 1989 CD &quot;Estrangeiro&quot; includes songs (&quot;Esse Amor&quot;, which means &quot;This Love&quot;, and &quot;Branquinha&quot;) inspired by and dedicated to, respectively, his ex-wife Dedé and his wife at the time, Paula Lavigne.

Veloso is one of the few public atheist celebrities in Brazil. He was brought up in a religious Catholic family but left the faith early on. In an interview Veloso stated that he did not like to &quot;lie to his own intelligence&quot; by believing in God. In a separate interview Veloso generated controversy when he said that Brazil would be better off if most people in the country were to become irreligious or atheist. Despite this, two of Veloso&#x27;s sons have become members of the neo-Pentecostal Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, with Veloso attending his children&#x27;s baptism, stating that &quot;what is good for them is good for me.&quot;

In 2022 Veloso talked about his bisexuality in a show commemorating his 80th birthday.

==Musical style==

Veloso&#x27;s home, Bahia, has had a decisive role in his music. He praises Bahia for its importance in Brazil&#x27;s colonial period—when the Portuguese first came—as well as for Bahia&#x27;s contribution to Brazilian music. He has cited among his musical influences Amália Rodrigues, Cole Porter, the Rolling Stones 1969 tour, and above all, João Gilberto.

Veloso says that he is unable to make a comparison between his musical style in the 1960s, at the height of Tropicália, and his current work. He does note, however, that he has been able to accomplish music of a higher quality later in his career; that he is &quot;better at everything.&quot;

<doc id="177287" wikidata="Q332442" url="?curid=177287" title="Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield">
<text>Sidney James Webb, 1st Baron Passfield, (13 July 1859 – 13 October 1947) was a British socialist, economist and reformer, who co-founded the London School of Economics. He was an early member of the Fabian Society in 1884, joining, like George Bernard Shaw, three months after its inception. Along with his wife Beatrice Webb and with Annie Besant, Graham Wallas, Edward R. Pease, Hubert Bland and Sydney Olivier, Shaw and Webb turned the Fabian Society into the pre-eminent politico-intellectual society in Edwardian England. He wrote the original, pro-nationalisation Clause IV for the British Labour Party.

==Background and education==
Webb was born at 45, Cranbourn Street, near Leicester Square, London, the second of three children of Charles Webb (1828/9-1891) and Elizabeth Mary (1820/21-1895), née Stacey. His father was &quot;variously described as an accountant, a perfumer, and a hairdresser&quot;; his mother was a &quot;hairdresser and dealer in toiletries&quot;. Webb&#x27;s upbringing was &quot;comfortable&quot;, the family employing a live-in servant; his father was &quot;a man of local substance&quot; as a rate collector, guardian, and sergeant in a volunteer regiment. Having attended a &quot;first-class middle class day school&quot; at St Martin&#x27;s Lane, and his parents having sent him abroad to Switzerland and Germany to extend his education, Webb later studied law at the Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution for a degree of the University of London in his spare time, while holding an office job. He also studied at King&#x27;s College London, before being called to the Bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn in 1885.

==Professional life==
In 1895, Webb helped to found the London School of Economics with a bequest left to the Fabian Society. He was appointed its Professor of Public Administration in 1912 and held the post for 15 years. In 1892, he married Beatrice Potter, who shared his interests and beliefs. The money she contributed to the marriage enabled him to give up his clerical job and concentrate on his other activities. Sidney and Beatrice Webb founded the &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine in 1913.

==Political career==

Webb and Potter were members of the Labour Party and took an active role in politics. Sidney became Member of Parliament for Seaham at the 1922 general election. The couple&#x27;s influence can be seen in their hosting of the Coefficients, a dining club that drew in some leading statesmen and thinkers of the day. In 1929, he was created Baron Passfield of Passfield Corner in the County of Southampton. He served as Secretary of State for the Colonies and as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s second Labour Government in 1929.

As Colonial Secretary he issued the Passfield White Paper that revised the government policy on Palestine, previously set by the Churchill White Paper of 1922. In 1930, failing health caused him to step down as Dominions Secretary, but he stayed on as Colonial Secretary until the fall of the Labour government in August 1931.

The Webbs ignored mounting evidence of atrocities being committed by Joseph Stalin and remained supporters of the Soviet Union until their deaths. Having reached their seventies and early eighties, their books, &quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Truth About Soviet Russia&quot; (1942), still gave a positive assessment of Stalin&#x27;s regime. The Trotskyist historian Al Richardson later dubbed &quot;Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?&quot; &quot;pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious&quot;.

==Writings==
Webb co-authored with his wife &quot;The History of Trade Unionism&quot; (1894). For the Fabian Society he wrote on poverty in London, the eight-hour day, land nationalisation, the nature of socialism, education, eugenics, and reform of the House of Lords. He also drafted Clause IV, which committed the Labour Party to public ownership of industry.

==References in literature==

In H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The New Machiavelli&quot; (1911), the Webbs, as &quot;the Baileys&quot;, are mercilessly lampooned as short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. The Fabian Society, of which Wells was briefly a member (1903–1908), fares no better in his estimation.

Beatrice Webb in her diary records that they &quot;read the caricatures of ourselves... with much interest and amusement. The portraits are very clever in a malicious way.&quot; She reviews the book and Wells&#x27;s character, summarising: &quot;As an attempt at representing a political philosophy the book utterly fails...&quot;

==Personal life==

When his wife, Beatrice, died in 1943, the casket of her ashes was buried in the garden of their house in Passfield Corner, as were those of Lord Passfield in 1947.

Shortly afterwards, George Bernard Shaw launched a petition to have both reburied in Westminster Abbey, which was eventually granted – the Webbs&#x27; ashes are interred in the nave, close to those of Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin.

The Webbs were also friends of philosopher Bertrand Russell.

In 2006, the London School of Economics, alongside the Housing Association, renamed its Great Dover Street student residence Sidney Webb House in his honour.

<text>Gilberto Passos Gil Moreira (; born 26 June 1942), is a Brazilian singer-songwriter and politician, known for both his musical innovation and political activism. From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil&#x27;s Minister of Culture in the administration of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Gil&#x27;s musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including rock, Brazilian genres including samba, African music, and reggae.

Gil started to play music as a child and was a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a bossa nova musician and grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, while also working as a politician and environmental advocate. Known internationally, the album Quanta Live at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, it won the award for Best World Album and album Eletracústico won Grammy Award—Best Contemporary World Music Album.

== Early life (1942–1963) ==
Gil was born in Salvador and spent much of his childhood in Ituaçu. Ituaçu was a small town of fewer than a thousand people, located in the sertão, or countryside, of Bahia. His father, José Gil Moreira, was a doctor; his mother, Claudina Passos Gil Moreira, an elementary school teacher. As a young boy, he attended a Marist Brothers school. Gil remained in Ituaçu until he was nine years old, returning to Salvador for secondary school.

Gil&#x27;s interest in music was precocious: &quot;When I was only two or two and a half&quot;, he recalled, &quot;I told my mother I was going to become a musician or president of my country&quot;. He grew up listening to the forró music of his native northeast, and took an interest in the street performers of Salvador. Early on, he began to play the drums and the trumpet, through listening to Bob Nelson on the radio. Gil&#x27;s mother was the &quot;chief supporter&quot; in his musical ambitions; she bought him an accordion and, when he was ten years old, sent him to music school in Salvador which he attended for four years. As an accordionist, Gil first played classical music, but grew more interested in the folk and popular music of Brazil. He was particularly influenced by singer and accordion player Luiz Gonzaga; he began to sing and play the accordion in an emulation of Gonzaga&#x27;s recordings. Gil has noted that he grew to identify with Gonzaga &quot;because he sang about the world around [him], the world that [he] encountered&quot;.

During his years in Salvador, Gil encountered the music of songwriter Dorival Caymmi, who he says represented to him the &quot;beach-oriented&quot; samba music of Salvador. Gonzaga and Caymmi were Gil&#x27;s formative influences. While in Salvador, Gil was introduced to many other styles of music, including American big band jazz and tango. In 1950 Gil moved back to Salvador with his family. It was there, while in high school, that he joined his first band, Os Desafinados (&quot;The Out of Tunes&quot;), in which he played accordion and vibraphone and sang. Os Desafinados was influenced by American rock and roll musicians like Elvis Presley, as well as singing groups from Rio de Janeiro. The band was active for two to three years. Soon afterwards, inspired by Brazilian musician João Gilberto, he settled on the guitar as his primary instrument and began to play bossa nova.

== Musical career (1963–present) ==

Gil met guitarist and singer Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP. Along with Maria Bethânia (Veloso&#x27;s sister), Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre&#x27;s opening night in July 1964, a show entitled &quot;Nós, por Exemplo&quot; (&quot;Us, for Example&quot;). Gil and the group continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series. Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses&quot;, whose style was influenced by The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, an album Gil listened to constantly. Gil describes &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses&quot; as the birth of the tropicália movement. As Gil describes it, tropicália, or tropicalismo, was a conflation of musical and cultural developments that had occurred in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (&quot;Young Wave&quot;) collective—with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe, a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time.

Early on in the 1960s, Gil earned income primarily from selling bananas in a shopping mall and composing jingles for television advertisements; he was also briefly employed by the Brazilian division of Unilever, Gessy-Lever. He moved to São Paulo in 1965 and had a hit single when his song &quot;Louvação&quot; (which later appeared on the album of the same name) was released by Elis Regina. His first hit as a solo artist was the 1969 song &quot;Aquele Abraço&quot;. Gil also performed on several television programs throughout the 1960s, which often included other &quot;tropicalistas&quot;, members of the Tropicalismo movement.

=== Imprisonment and exile ===
In October 1968, Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso performed at Sucata club in Rio de Janeiro, with Hélio Oiticica&#x27;s poem-flag displayed on stage. The journalist of RecordTV propagated a story that Caetano and Gil had sung the Brazilian National Anthem in subversive parody. The two musicians were arrested without trial December 27, 1968—shortly after the military state had passed on December 13 Institutional Act Number Five, which suspended habeas corpus.

In February 1969 Gil and Veloso were arrested by the Brazilian military government, brought from São Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, and spent three months in prison and another four under house arrest, before being freed on the condition that they leave the country. Veloso was the first to be arrested; the police moved to Gil&#x27;s home soon afterward. Veloso had directed his then-wife Andréa Gadelha to warn Gil about the possibility of arrest, but Gil was eventually brought into the police van along with Veloso. They were given no reason or charge for their arrest. Gil believes that the government felt his actions &quot;represent[ed] a threat [to them], something new, something that can&#x27;t quite be understood, something that doesn&#x27;t fit into any of the clear compartments of existing cultural practices, and that won&#x27;t do. That is dangerous.&quot; During his prison sentence, Gil began to meditate, follow a macrobiotic diet, and read about Eastern philosophy. He composed four songs during his imprisonment, among them &quot;Cérebro Electrônico&quot; (&quot;Electronic Brain&quot;), which first appeared on his 1969 album &quot;Gilberto Gil 1969&quot;, and later on his 2006 album &quot;Gil Luminoso&quot;. Thereafter, Gil and Veloso were exiled to London, England after being offered to leave Brazil. The two played a last Brazilian concert together in Salvador in July 1969, and travelled to Portugal, Paris, and London. He and Veloso took a house in Chelsea, with their wives and manager. Gil was involved in the organisation of the 1971 Glastonbury Free Festival and was exposed to reggae while living in London; he recalls listening to Bob Marley (whose songs he later covered), Jimmy Cliff, and Burning Spear. He was heavily influenced by and involved with the city&#x27;s rock scene as well, performing with Yes, Pink Floyd, and the Incredible String Band. However, he also performed solo, recording &quot;Gilberto Gil&quot; (&quot;Nêga&quot;) while in London. In addition to involvement in the reggae and rock scenes, Gil attended performances by jazz artists, including Miles Davis and Sun Ra.
When he went back to Bahia in 1972, Gil focused on his musical career and environmental advocacy work. He released &quot;Expresso 2222&quot; the same year, from which two popular singles were released. Gil toured the United States and recorded an English-language album as well, continuing to release a steady stream of albums throughout the 1970s, including &quot;Realce&quot; and &quot;Refazenda.&quot; In the early 1970s Gil participated in a resurgence of the Afro-Brazilian afoxé tradition in Carnaval, joining the Filhos de Gandhi (&quot;Sons of Gandhi&quot;) performance group, which only allowed black Brazilians to join. Gil also recorded a song titled &quot;Patuscada de Gandhi&quot; written about the Filhos de Gandhi that appeared on his 1977 album &quot;Refavela&quot;. Greater attention was paid to afoxé groups in Carnaval because of the publicity that Gil had provided to them through his involvement; the groups increased in size as well. In the late 1970s he left Brazil for Africa and visited Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Nigeria. He also worked with Jimmy Cliff and released a cover of &quot;No Woman, No Cry&quot; with him in 1980, a number one hit that introduced reggae to Brazil.

In 1996, Gil contributed &quot;Refazenda&quot; to the AIDS-Benefit Album Red Hot + Rio produced by the Red Hot Organization.

In 1998 the live version of his album &quot;Quanta&quot; won Gil the Grammy Award for Best World Music Album. In 2005 he won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary World Music Album for &quot;Eletracústico&quot;. In May 2005 he was awarded the Polar Music Prize by Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm, the prize&#x27;s first Latin American recipient. On October 16 of the same year he received the Légion d&#x27;honneur from the government of France, coinciding with the Année du Brésil en France (&quot;Brazil&#x27;s Year in France&quot;).

In 2010 he released the album &quot;Fé Na Festa&quot;, a record devoted to forró, a style of music from Brazil&#x27;s northeast. His tour to promote this album received some negative feedback from fans who were expecting to hear a set featuring his hits. In 2013, Gilberto Gil plays his own role as a singer and promoter of cultural diversity in a long feature documentary shot around the southern hemisphere by Swiss filmmaker Pierre-Yves Borgeaud, &quot;Viramundo: a musical journey with Gilberto Gil&quot;, distributed worldwide. The film also inaugurates the T.I.D.E. experiment for pan-European and multi-support releases.

His album &quot;OK OK OK&quot; was ranked as the 4th best Brazilian album of 2018 by the Brazilian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and among the 25 best Brazilian albums of the second half of 2018 by the São Paulo Association of Art Critics.

== Political career (1987–present) ==
Gil describes his attitude towards politics thus: &quot;I&#x27;d rather see my position in the government as that of an administrator or manager. But politics is a necessary ingredient.&quot; His political career began in 1987, when he was elected to a local post in Bahia and became the Salvador secretary of culture. In 1988, he was elected to the city council and subsequently became city commissioner for environmental protection. However, he left the office after one term and declined to run for the National Congress of Brazil. In 1990, Gil left the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party and joined the Green Party. During this period, Gil founded the environmental protection organization Onda Azul (&quot;Blue Wave&quot;), which worked to protect Brazilian waters. He maintained a full-time musical career at the same time, and withdrew temporarily from politics in 1992, following the release &quot;Parabolicamará&quot;, considered to be one of his most successful efforts. On October 16, 2001 Gil accepted his nomination to be a Goodwill Ambassador for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, having promoted the organization before his appointment.

When President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in January 2003, he chose Gil as Brazil&#x27;s new Minister of Culture, the second black person to serve in the country&#x27;s cabinet. The appointment was controversial among political and artistic figures and the Brazilian press; a remark Gil made about difficulties with his salary received particular criticism. Gil had not been a member of Lula&#x27;s Workers&#x27; Party and had not participated in creating its cultural program. Shortly after becoming Minister, Gil began a partnership between Brazil and Creative Commons. In 2003, he gave a concert in the UN General Assembly in honour of the victims of the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad. In that concert, he played together with Secretary General Kofi Annan.

As Minister, he sponsored a program called Culture Points, which gave grants to provide music technology and education to people living in poor areas of the country&#x27;s cities. Gil asserted that &quot;You&#x27;ve now got young people who are becoming designers, who are making it into media and being used more and more by television and samba schools and revitalizing degraded neighborhoods. It&#x27;s a different vision of the role of government, a new role.&quot; Gil also expressed interest in a program to establish an Internet repository of freely downloadable Brazilian music. Following Gil&#x27;s appointment, the department&#x27;s expenditures increased by over 50 percent. In November 2007 Gil announced his intention to resign from his post due to a vocal cord polyp. Lula rejected Gil&#x27;s first two attempts to resign, but accepted a further request in July 2008. Lula said on this occasion that Gil was &quot;going back to being a great artist, going back to giving priority to what is most important&quot; to him.

== Personal life ==
Gil has been married four times. He had two daughters Nara and Marilia, with first wife Belina Aguiar. He was then married to famous singer Nana Caymmi, they had no children. His third wife was Sandra Gadelha with whom he had three children: Pedro, Preta and Maria. Sandra inspired one of his most beloved songs Drão, she was with him during the very hard times of Brazilian dictatorship and they both were exiled. His fourth wife is Flora Giordano. The couple has three children: Bem, Isabella and Jose. His first son Pedro Gil, Egotrip&#x27;s drummer – died in a car accident in 1990. Preta Gil, an actress and singer, is his daughter with Sandra Gadelha.

Gil&#x27;s religious beliefs have changed significantly over his lifetime. Originally, he was a Christian, but was later influenced by Eastern philosophy and religion, and, later, explored African spirituality. He is an agnostic. He practices yoga and is a vegetarian.

Gil has been open about the fact that he has smoked marijuana for much of his life. He has said he believes &quot;that drugs should be treated like pharmaceuticals, legalized, although under the same regulations and monitoring as medicines&quot;.

In 2023, Gil revealed that he had also been in a relationship with men, stating &quot;We are all bisexual&quot;.

== Musical style and influences ==

Gil is a tenor, but he sings in the baritone or falsetto register, with lyrics and/or scat syllables. His lyrics are on subjects that range from philosophy to religion, folktales, and word play. Gil&#x27;s musical style incorporates a broad range of influences. The first music he was exposed to included The Beatles and street performers in various metropolitan areas of Bahia. During his first years as a musician, Gil performed primarily in a blend of traditional Brazilian styles with two-step rhythms, such as baião and samba. He states that &quot;My first phase was one of traditional forms. Nothing experimental at all. Caetano [Veloso] and I followed in the tradition of Luiz Gonzaga and Jackson do Pandeiro, combining samba with northeastern music.&quot; American music critic Robert Christgau said that along with Jorge Ben, Gil was &quot;always ready to go further out on a beat than the other samba/bossa geniuses&quot;.

As one of the pioneers of tropicália, influences from genres such as rock and punk have been pervasive in his recordings, as they have been in those of other stars of the period, including Caetano Veloso and Tom Zé. Gil&#x27;s interest in the blues-based music of rock pioneer Jimi Hendrix, in particular, has been described by Veloso as having &quot;extremely important consequences for Brazilian music&quot;. Veloso also noted the influence of Brazilian guitarist and singer Jorge Ben on Gil&#x27;s musical style, coupled with that of traditional music. After the height of tropicália in the 1960s, Gil became increasingly interested in black culture, particularly in the Jamaican musical genre of reggae. He described the genre as &quot;a form of democratizing, internationalizing, speaking a new language, a Heideggerian form of passing along fundamental messages&quot;.

Visiting Lagos, Nigeria, in 1976 for the Festival of African Culture (FESTAC), Gil met fellow musicians Fela Kuti and Stevie Wonder. He became inspired by African music and later integrated some of the styles he had heard in Africa, such as juju and highlife, into his own recordings. One of the most famous of these African-influenced records was the 1977 album &quot;Refavela&quot;, which included &quot;No Norte da Saudade&quot; (&quot;To the North of Sadness&quot;), a song heavily influenced by reggae. When Gil returned to Brazil after the visit, he focused on Afro-Brazilian culture, becoming a member of the Carnaval afoxé group Filhos de Gandhi.

Conversely, his 1980s musical repertoire presented an increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, as well as the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album &quot;Acoustic&quot; was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.

<text>The Kaveri (also known as Cauvery) is a major river flowing across Southern India. It is the third largest river in the region after Godavari and Krishna. 
The catchment area of the Kaveri basin is estimated to be and encompasses the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, and the union territory of Puducherry.

The river rises at Talakaveri in the Brahmagiri range in the Western Ghats. The source is located at an elevation of in the Kodagu district of Karnataka. The river flows for about through the Deccan plateau in Karnataka before entering Tamil Nadu. It flows further eastward in Tamil Nadu for before flowing into the Bay of Bengal near Poompuhar in Mayiladuthurai district of Tamil Nadu. The river flows for a total length of about . The major tributaries include Amaravati, Arkavati, Bhavani, Hemavati, Kabini, Lakshmana Tirtha, and Noyyal.

There are a number of dams on the river which form part of an extensive irrigation system and are used for the generation of hydroelectric power. The river has supported agriculture for centuries and has served as the lifeline of several kingdoms in the past. Access to the river&#x27;s waters has been a cause of dispute among the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu for decades. The Kaveri basin is a densely populated region, with several towns and cities located on its banks.

The river is considered as sacred by the people of Southern India and is considered to be among the seven holy rivers of India. The river is often personified and worshiped as the goddess Kaveri. The river is mentioned in various Hindu religious texts including the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;. In ancient Tamil literature, the river is referenced to as &quot;Ponni&quot; meaning &quot;the golden one&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Kaveri is mentioned in Sanskrit as a holy river in various Hindu religious texts including the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;. The name itself might have had different etymologies. As per &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, the river arose after Ganesha took a form of a crow and toppled sage Agastya&#x27;s kamandala. The river then took its name from the Tamil language words &quot;kā&quot; meaning &quot;crow&quot; and &quot;viri&quot; meaning &quot;spread&quot; literally translating to &quot;spread by a crow&quot;. It might also mean a river with wide spread banks as &quot;viri&quot; can also be translated as wide spread. The etymology of the river might have also been derived from &quot;kāviri&quot;, the Sankethi word for &quot;river&quot; from the language spoken by the Sankethi people, who live along its waters. Cauvery is the anglicized version of the original name.

The river is also known by other names. In ancient Tamil literature, the river was called &quot;Ponni&quot; meaning &quot;the golden one&quot; in reference to the fine silt it deposits. It is known as &quot;Daksina gaṅgā&quot; meaning the &quot;Ganges of the South&quot; indicating its geographical location and its significance. It is also mentioned as &quot;Ardha gaṅgā&quot; meaning &quot;Half Ganga&quot; in Mahabharata and other literature, due to its purported mythology of having arisen from the Ganges. Marudvṛdhā is another hypothesised name for this river, meaning &quot;the beloved of the Maruts&quot; in Sanskrit.

== Course ==
The river arises at Talakaveri in Kodagu district of Karnataka. The source of the river is located at an altitude of in the Brahmagiri Hills of the Western Ghats. Its follows a rough upper course consisting of rocky beds and high banks. Once it leaves the Kodagu hills, it flows eastwards and forms a series of rapids and falls. It flows through a narrow gorge onto the Deccan plateau and drops about at Chunchanakatte Falls. The river forms the island of Srirangapatna and widens to before flowing south-east. At Shivanasamudra, the river drops and forms the Shivanasamudra Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in the country. After forming the island of Shivanasamudra, the river converges and passes through the Mekedatu gorge. After flowing for in Karnataka, the river flows for about along the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border.

The river enters Tamil Nadu and forms the Hogenakkal Falls. After the falls, the river flows southwards towards Mettur Dam and joins its main right bank tributary Bhavani at Kooduthurai. The river flows eastwards through Erode and Karur, and widens further before entering the Tiruchirappalli district. It splits into two branches with the northern part called as Kollidam River and the southern part of the river retaining the name Kaveri. After flowing for , the two branches converge around the Srirangam island. The river further branches off into 36 different channels before emptying into the Bay of Bengal near Puhar in Mayiladuthurai district. The river traverses for about in Tamil Nadu for a total length of about .

=== Tributaries ===
The Kaveri River has 21 major tributaries. The largest tributary Hemavati, and Lakshmana Tirtha join the river at Krishna Raja Sagara. Kabini is another major contributor to the flow of Kaveri and joins the river in Karnataka. It meets with its second largest tributary Bhavani at Kooduthurai in Bhavani and two other tributaries Noyyal, and Amaravati join further down the stream in Tamil Nadu. Other tributaries of Kaveri include Shimsha, Arkavati, Sarabanga, and Thirumanimutharu.

== Geology and ecology ==
The Kaveri basin was formed in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous period during Gondwana breakup and opening of the Indian Ocean. Most of the basin is made up of Precambrian rocks and the two major rock types that are found are metamorphic and igneous rocks. Closepet granite is found in the upper parts of the Kaveri basin and Charnockite rocks are only found in the central part. A 2017 paper proposed that an impact structure was present in the vicinity of the Kaveri river. The run-off from the river does not drain off quickly because of the shape of the river basin, which limits the occurrence of floods. It is a perennial river fed mostly by monsoons. Four distinct seasons occur in the basin with hot and cold seasons sandwiching the monsoon seasons. The river basin is fed by South-West monsoon in Karnataka, and North-East monsoon in Tamil Nadu.

The Kaveri basin is made up of two sub-zones, forest and agro-ecosystem. The forest vegetation consists of a mix of dry deciduous, evergreen forests, and grasslands. As per a study, about of natural vegetation was lost in the river basin between 1965 and 2016. The basin has a variety of flora with major species including &quot;Terminalia arjuna&quot;, &quot;Tamarindus indica&quot;, &quot;Pongamia pinnata&quot;, &quot;Salix tetrasperma&quot;, &quot;Ficus benghalensis&quot;, &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;, &quot;Eucalyptus torticornis&quot;, and &quot;Diospyros montana&quot;.

There are many protected areas spread across the river basin including significant tiger and elephant habitats. The basin provides habitat to a range of animal species such as gaur, leopard, sloth bear, Bengal tiger, Indian elephant, Nilgiri tahr, grizzled giant squirrel, and various species of deer, wild boar and reptiles. The river also hosts a variety of avifauna including the painted stork (&quot;Mycteria leucocephala&quot;), spot-billed pelican (&quot;Pelecanus philippensis&quot;), and black-headed ibis (&quot;Threskiornis melanocephalus&quot;). It is also home to the mugger crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus palustris&quot;), smooth-coated otter &quot;(Lutrogale perspicillata),&quot; and hump-backed mahseer &quot;(Tor remadevii).&quot;

== Riparian zone ==
The total watershed of the basin is and the riparian zone of the river consists of in Tamil Nadu, in Karnataka, in Kerala, and in the union territory of Puducherry. Over half of the Kaveri basin is arable and the most cultivated crops are rice and sugarcane. An estimate at the time of the first Five Year Plan put the total flow of the river at , of which 60% was used for irrigation. The river is also used for drinking water and hydroelectric power generation.

The Grand Anicut was constructed by a Chola King in 2nd century CE. The hydroelectric plant built on the Sivanasamudra Falls in 1902 was the first hydroelectric plant in Asia. 
The Mettur Dam in Tamil Nadu was constructed in 1934 and the Stanley Reservoir formed by the dam has a capacity of 93.4 tmc ft. Krishna Raja Sagara in Karnataka is the second largest dam on the river and has a capacity of 49.5 tmc ft. Bhavanisagar Dam (32.8 tmc ft) on the Bhavani River in Tamil Nadu, Hemavathy Dam (37.1 tmc ft) on the Hemavathi River, Kabini Dam (18.5 tmc ft) on the Kabini River, and Harangi Dam (9.5 tmc ft) on the Harangi River in Karnataka are major dams on the tributaries of Kaveri.

=== Water dispute ===

The dispute over the sharing of Kaveri waters began in 1807 when the Madras Presidency objected to the plans of the Mysore kingdom to develop irrigation projects. After initial discussions failed, the British Raj intervened and a six rule agreement called the &quot;General Agreement of 1892&quot; was signed. After Indian Independence, article 262 of the Constitution of India provided powers to the Government of India to adjudicate on inter-state disputes on water sharing. The Government of India constituted the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT) on 2 June 1990 to adjudicate the water dispute between the riparian states and territories in the river basin. In an order passed in June 1991, the CWDT directed Karnataka to release 205 tmc ft of water per year to Tamil Nadu based on a specific schedule. The water was to be released in four equal installments in a particular month and any shortfall would need to be covered in the subsequent week. Tamil Nadu was directed to provide 6 tmc ft of water to Puducherry.

In July 1991, the President of India asked the Supreme Court of India to rule on the validity and legality of the tribunal under the Constitution. In November 1991, the Supreme Court opined that the order needs to be published by the central government in the Official Gazette, which was done on 1 December 1991. In May 1992, the Government of Tamil Nadu filed a case in the Supreme Court to direct the Indian Government to pass necessary orders to ensure the implementation of the provisions of the tribunal order. In April 1997, the Attorney General of India reverted that the central government has prepared a scheme under the Inter-State Water Disputes Act, 1956 for the implementation of the tribunal award and the Cauvery Water Authority (CRA) and Cauvery Monitoring Committee (CMC) were formed subsequently as a part of the Cauvery Water (Implementation of Interim Orders of 1991 and all subsequent Tribunal Orders) Scheme, 1998. The CRA is headed by the Prime Minister of India and consists of the Chief Ministers of the riparian states as its constituent members.

On 16 February 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that Karnataka will get 284.75 tmc ft, Tamil Nadu will get 404.25 tmc ft, Kerala will get 30 tmc ft and Puducherry will get 7 tmc ft of water from the river. An additional 10 tmc ft was reserved for environmental protection and 4 tmc ft was reserved for wastage into the sea. The court directed the government to form a Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) within six weeks and acting on the Supreme Court&#x27;s direction, the central government constituted the CMWA in June 2018.

== Religious significance ==
In Hinduism, the river is considered one of seven holy rivers in India. The river is personified and worshiped as the river goddess &quot;Kaveri Amma.&quot;

 Kaveri is mentioned as both a river and a goddess in various Hindu texts such as the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;. The river is mentioned as one of the seven holy Gangas and bathing in the river is said to grant one&#x27;s desired as per the &quot;Sivapurana&quot;. The &quot;Varaha Purana&quot; states that the river flows from the five great mountains and gives longevity to those who drink the waters of the river. The &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; narrates the various origins of the river. Shiva filled Agastya&#x27;s bowl with Kaveri, who flowed as a river with the help of Ganesha.

In another legend, Lopamudra becomes Agastya&#x27;s wife and takes on a form of water during a severe drought in South India. Agastya carries her in his small brass water pot and Ganesha, in the form of crow, knocks the water pot down. The spilled water runs down the hill and onto the drought-stricken land. Another story narrates that during the Samudra Manthana, or churning of the Ocean of Milk, Mohini and Lopamudra retrieved the nectar of immortality for the gods. Afterwards, Brahma took care of Lopamudra as his daughter and later offered her to king Kavera, who renamed her as Kaveri. When Kaveri grew up she prayed to Brahma to transform her into a purifying river.

As per the Tamil literature &quot;Manimekalai&quot;, Agastya drank the Ganges River in anger, when the floods destroyed his tapas and later released it in South India. &quot;Silapathikaram&quot; mentions Kaveri as the daughter of Kavera. In Theravada Buddhism, Kaveri is mentioned as a water channel. It is part of the twenty canal-systems associated with the reservoir Parakkamasamudda that existed in the Polonnaruwa region during the reign of king Parakramabahu I.

<text>A Study of History is a 12-volume universal history by the British historian Arnold J. Toynbee, published from 1934 to 1961. It received enormous popular attention but according to historian Richard J. Evans, &quot;enjoyed only a brief vogue before disappearing into the obscurity in which it has languished.&quot; Toynbee&#x27;s goal was to trace the development and decay of 19 or 21 world civilizations in the historical record, applying his model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration.

The 19 (or 21) major civilizations, as Toynbee sees them, are: Egyptian, Andean, Sumerian, Babylonic, Hittite, Minoan, Indic, Hindu, Syriac, Hellenic, Western, Orthodox Christian (having two branches: the main or Byzantine body and the Russian branch), Far Eastern (having two branches: the main or Chinese body and the Japanese-Korean branch), Islamic (having two branches which later merged: Arabic and Iranic), Mayan, Mexican and Yucatec. Moreover, there are three &quot;abortive civilizations&quot; (Abortive Far Western Christian, Abortive Far Eastern Christian, Abortive Scandinavian) and five &quot;arrested civilizations&quot; (Polynesian, Eskimo, Nomadic, Ottoman, Spartan), for a total of 27 or 29.

== Titles of the volumes ==
The 12-volume work contains more than 3 million words and about 7,000 pages, plus 412 pages of indices.

== Genesis and Growth ==
Toynbee argues that civilizations are born out of more primitive societies, not as the result of racial or environmental factors, but as a response to &quot;challenges&quot;, such as hard country, new ground, blows and pressures from other civilizations, and penalization. He argues that for civilizations to be born, the challenge must be a golden mean; that excessive challenge will crush the civilization, and too little challenge will cause it to stagnate. He argues that civilizations continue to grow only when they meet one challenge only to be met by another, in a continuous cycle of &quot;Challenge and Response&quot;. He argues that civilizations develop in different ways due to their different environments and different approaches to the challenges they face. He argues that growth is driven by &quot;Creative Minorities&quot;: those who find solutions to the challenges, who inspire (rather than compel) others to follow their innovative lead. This is done through the &quot;faculty of mimesis.&quot; Creative minorities find solutions to the challenges a civilization faces, while the great mass follow these solutions by imitation, solutions they otherwise would be incapable of discovering on their own.

In 1939, Toynbee wrote, &quot;The challenge of being called upon to create a political world-order, the framework for an economic world-order … now confronts our Modern Western society.&quot;

== Breakdown and Disintegration ==
Toynbee does not see the breakdown of civilizations as caused by loss of control over the physical environment, by loss of control over the human environment, or by attacks from outside. Rather, it comes from the deterioration of the &quot;Creative Minority&quot;, which eventually ceases to be creative and degenerates into merely a &quot;Dominant Minority&quot;.

He argues that creative minorities deteriorate due to a worship of their &quot;former self,&quot; by which they become prideful and fail adequately to address the next challenge they face.

==Results of the breakdown ==
The final breakdown results in &quot;positive acts of creation;&quot; the dominant minority seeks to create a Universal state to preserve its power and influence, and the internal proletariat seeks to create a Universal church to preserve its spiritual values and cultural norms.

=== Universal state ===
He argues that the ultimate sign a civilization has broken down is when the dominant minority forms a &quot;universal state&quot;, which stifles political creativity within the existing social order. The classic example of this is the Roman Empire, though many other imperial regimes are cited as examples. Toynbee writes:

&quot;First the Dominant Minority attempts to hold by force—against all right and reason—a position of inherited privilege which it has ceased to merit; and then the Proletariat repays injustice with resentment, fear with hate, and violence with violence. Yet the whole movement ends in positive acts of creation. The Dominant Minority creates a universal state, the Internal Proletariat a universal church, and the External Proletariat a bevy of barbarian war-bands.&quot;

=== Universal church ===
Toynbee developed his concept of an &quot;internal proletariat&quot; and an &quot;external proletariat&quot; to describe quite different opposition groups within and outside the frontiers of a civilization. These groups, however, find themselves bound to the fate of the civilization. During its decline and disintegration, they are increasingly disenfranchised or alienated, and thus lose their immediate sense of loyalty or of obligation. Nonetheless an &quot;internal proletariat,&quot; untrusting of the dominant minority, may form a &quot;universal church&quot; which survives the civilization&#x27;s demise, co-opting the useful structures such as marriage laws of the earlier time while creating a new philosophical or religious pattern for the next stage of history.

Before the process of disintegration, the dominant minority had held the internal proletariat in subjugation within the confines of the civilization, causing these oppressed to grow bitter. The external proletariat, living outside the civilization in poverty and chaos, grows envious. Then, in the social stress resulting from the failure of the civilization, the bitterness and envy increase markedly.

Toynbee argues that as civilizations decay, there is a &quot;schism&quot; within the society. In this environment of discord, people resort to archaism (idealization of the past), futurism (idealization of the future), detachment (removal of oneself from the realities of a decaying world), and transcendence (meeting the challenges of the decaying civilization with new insight, e.g., by following a new religion). From among members of an &quot;internal proletariat&quot; who transcend the social decay a &quot;church&quot; may arise. Such an association would contain new and stronger spiritual insights, around which a subsequent civilization may begin to form. Toynbee here uses the word &quot;church&quot; in a general sense, e.g., to refer to a collective spiritual bond found in common worship, or the unity found in an agreed social order.

== Predictions ==
It remains to be seen what will come of the four remaining civilizations of the 21st century: Western civilization, Islamic society, Hindu society, and the Far East. Toynbee argues two possibilities: they might all merge with Western Civilization, or Western civilization might develop a &#x27;Universal State&#x27; after its &#x27;Time of Troubles&#x27;, decay, and die.

== List of civilizations ==

The following table lists the 23 civilizations identified by Toynbee in vol. Vii. This table does not include what Toynbee terms primitive societies, arrested civilizations, or abortive civilizations. Civilizations are shown in boldface. Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;Universal Churches&quot; are written in &quot;italic&quot; and are chronologically located between second- and third- generation civilizations, as is described in volume VII.

== Reception ==
Historian Carroll Quigley expanded upon Toynbee&#x27;s notion of civilizational collapse in &quot;The Evolution of Civilizations&quot; (1961, 1979). He argued that societal disintegration involves the metamorphosis of social instruments, set up to meet actual needs, into institutions, which serve their own interest at the expense of social needs.

Social scientist Ashley Montagu assembled 29 other historians&#x27; articles to form a symposium on Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;A Study of History&quot;, published as &quot;Toynbee and History: Critical Essays and Reviews&quot;. The book includes three of Toynbee&#x27;s own essays: &quot;What I am Trying to Do&quot; (originally published in &quot;International Affairs&quot; vol. 31, 1955); &quot;What the Book is For: How the Book Took Shape&quot; (a pamphlet written upon completion of the final volumes of &quot;A Study of History&quot;) and a comment written in response to the articles by Edward Fiess and Pieter Geyl (originally published in &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas&quot;, vol. 16, 1955.)

David Wilkinson suggests that there is an even larger unit than civilisation. Using the ideas drawn from &quot;World Systems Theory&quot; he suggests that since at least 1500 BC that there was a connection established between a number of formerly separate civilisations to form a single interacting &quot;Central Civilisation&quot;, which expanded to include formerly separate civilisations such as India, the Far East, and eventually Western Europe and the Americas into a single &quot;World System&quot;. In some ways, it resembles what William H. McNeill calls the &quot;Closure of the Eurasian Ecumene, 500 B.C.-200 A.D.&quot;

=== Legacy ===
After 1960, Toynbee&#x27;s ideas faded both in academia and the media, to the point of seldom being cited today. Toynbee&#x27;s approach to history, his style of civilizational analysis, faced skepticism from mainstream historians who thought it put an undue emphasis on the divine, which led to his academic reputation declining, though for a time, Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;Study&quot; remained popular outside academia. Nevertheless, interest revived decades later with the publication of &quot;The Clash of Civilizations&quot; (1997) by political scientist Samuel P. Huntington. Huntington viewed human history as broadly the history of civilizations and posited that the world after the end of the Cold War will be a multi-polar one of competing major civilizations divided by &quot;fault lines.&quot;

In popular culture, Toynbee&#x27;s theories of historical cycles and civilisational collapse are said to have been a major inspiration for Isaac Asimov&#x27;s seminal science-fiction novels, the Foundation series.

=== Jews and Armenians as a &quot;fossil society&quot; ===

In the introduction of his work Toynbee refers to a number of &quot;fossilized relics&quot; of societies, among others he mentions the Armenians, who according to Toynbee played a similar role to that of the Jews in the world of Islam.

&quot;...and yet another Syriac remnant, the Armenian Gregorian Monophysites, have played much the same part in the World of Islam.&quot; 
Volume 1 of the book, written in the 1930s, contains a discussion of Jewish culture which begins with the sentence &quot;There remains the case where victims of religious discrimination represent an extinct society which only survives as a fossil. ... by far the most notable is one of the fossil remnants of the Syriac Society, the Jews.&quot; That sentence has been the subject of controversy, and some reviewers have interpreted the line as antisemitic (notably after 1945). In later printings, a footnote was appended which read &quot;Mr. Toynbee wrote this part of the book before the Nazi persecution of the Jews opened a new and terrible chapter of the story...&quot;. The subject is extensively debated with input from critics in Vol XII, &quot;Reconsiderations&quot;, published in 1961.

<text>Aflatoxins are various poisonous carcinogens and mutagens that are produced by certain molds, particularly &quot;Aspergillus&quot; species mainly by &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;.

In short, the relevant fungi grow on almost any crop or food. When such contaminated food is processed or consumed, the aflatoxins enter the general food supply. They have been found in both pet and human foods, as well as in feedstocks for agricultural animals. Animals fed contaminated food can pass aflatoxin transformation products into milk, milk products, and meat. For example, contaminated poultry feed is the suspected source of aflatoxin-contaminated chicken meat and eggs in Pakistan.

Children are particularly vulnerable to aflatoxin exposure, which is linked to immune suppression, stunted growth, delayed development, aflatoxicosis, and liver cancer. Some studies have reported an association between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure, although this link has not been consistently detected in all studies. Furthermore, a causal relationship between childhood stunting and aflatoxin exposure has yet to be conclusively shown by epidemiological studies, though such investigations are underway. Adults have a higher tolerance to exposure, but are also at risk. No animal species is known to be immune. Aflatoxins are among the most carcinogenic substances known. After entering the body, aflatoxins may be metabolized by the liver to a reactive epoxide intermediate or hydroxylated to become the less harmful aflatoxin M1.

Aflatoxin poisoning most commonly results from ingestion, but the most toxic aflatoxin compound, B1, can permeate through the skin.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action levels for aflatoxin present in food or feed is 20 to 300 ppb. The FDA has had occasion to declare both human and pet food recalls as a precautionary measure to prevent exposure.

The term &quot;aflatoxin&quot; is derived from the name of the species &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;, in which some of the compounds first were discovered. A new disease was identified with unknown characteristics in England during the 1950s and 1960s, which increased turkey mortality. Later, aflatoxin was recognized in 1960 in England as a causative agent of the mysterious Turkey &#x27;X&#x27; disease that causes excessive mortality in turkey poults. Aflatoxins form one of the major groupings of mycotoxins, and apart from &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; various members of the group of compounds occur in species such as &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus pseudocaelatus&quot;, &quot;Aspergillus pseudonomius&quot;, and &quot;Aspergillus nomius&quot;.

== Major types and their metabolites ==

Aflatoxin B1 is considered the most toxic and is produced by both &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;. Aflatoxin M1 is present in the fermentation broth of &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;, but it and aflatoxin M2 are also produced when an infected liver metabolizes aflatoxin B1 and B2.

* Aflatoxin B1 and B2 (AFB), produced by &quot;A. flavus&quot; and &quot;A. parasiticus&quot;
* Aflatoxin G1 and G2 (AFG), produced by some Group II &quot;A. flavus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;
* Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), metabolite of aflatoxin B1 in humans and animals (exposure in ng levels may come from a mother&#x27;s milk)
* Aflatoxin M2, metabolite of aflatoxin B2 in milk of cattle fed on contaminated foods
* Aflatoxicol (AFL): metabolite produced by breaking down the lactone ring
* Aflatoxin Q1 (AFQ1), major metabolite of AFB1 in &quot;in vitro&quot; liver preparations of other higher vertebrates

AFM, AFQ, and AFL retain the possibility to become an epoxide. Nevertheless, they appear much less capable of causing mutagenesis than the unmetabolized ABM.

== Contamination conditions ==

Aflatoxins are produced by both &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus parasiticus&quot;, which are common forms of &#x27;weedy&#x27; molds widespread in nature. The presence of those molds does not always indicate that harmful levels of aflatoxin are present, but does indicate a significant risk. The molds can colonize and contaminate food before harvest or during storage, especially following prolonged exposure to a high-humidity environment, or to stressful conditions such as drought. Aflatoxin contamination is increasing in crops such as maize as a result of climate change creating better conditions for these molds.

The native habitat of &quot;Aspergillus&quot; is in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological deterioration, but it invades all types of organic substrates whenever conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions for production of aflatoxins include high moisture content (at least 7%) and temperatures from [optimum ]. Aflatoxins have been isolated from all major cereal crops, and from sources as diverse as peanut butter and cannabis. The staple commodities regularly contaminated with aflatoxins include cassava, chilies, corn, cotton seed, millet, peanuts, rice, sorghum, sunflower seeds, tree nuts, wheat, and a variety of spices intended for human or animal consumption. Aflatoxin transformation products are sometimes found in eggs, milk products, and meat when animals are fed contaminated grains.

A study conducted in Kenya and Mali found that the predominant practices for drying and storage of maize were inadequate in minimizing exposure to aflatoxins.

Organic crops, which are not treated with fungicides, may be more susceptible to contamination with aflatoxins.
==Prevention==

A primary means of limiting risk from aflatoxins in the food supply is food hygiene in the commercial commodity supply chain, such as rejecting moldy grain for use in food processing plants and testing of batches of ingredients for aflatoxin levels before adding them to the mix. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA set limits on acceptable levels. Grain drying itself, which is necessary for viable combine harvesting in many regions, lays the fundamentals for this effort by preventing stored grain from being too damp in the first place.

There is very limited evidence to show that agricultural and nutritional education can reduce exposure to aflatoxin in low to middle income countries.

==Pathology==

No animal species is known to be immune to the acute toxic effects of aflatoxins. Adult humans have a high tolerance for aflatoxin exposure and rarely succumb to acute aflatoxicosis, but children are particularly affected, and their exposure can lead to stunted growth and delayed development, in addition to all the symptoms mentioned below.

High-level aflatoxin exposure produces an acute hepatic necrosis (acute aflatoxicosis), resulting later in cirrhosis or carcinoma of the liver. Acute liver failure is made manifest by bleeding, edema, alteration in digestion, changes to the absorption and/or metabolism of nutrients, and mental changes and/or coma.

Chronic, subclinical exposure does not lead to symptoms so dramatic as acute aflatoxicosis. Chronic exposure increases the risk of developing liver and gallbladder cancer, as aflatoxin metabolites may intercalate into DNA and alkylate the bases through its epoxide moiety. This is thought to cause mutations in the &quot;p53&quot; gene, an important gene in preventing cell cycle progression when there are DNA mutations, or signaling apoptosis (programmed cell death). These mutations seem to affect some base pair locations more than others, for example, the third base of codon 249 of the p53 gene appears to be more susceptible to aflatoxin-mediated mutations than nearby bases. As with other DNA-alkylating agents, Aflatoxin B1 can cause immune suppression, and exposure to it is associated with an increased viral load in HIV positive individuals.

The expression of aflatoxin-related diseases is influenced by factors such as species, age, nutrition, sex, and the possibility of concurrent exposure to other toxins. The main target organ in mammals is the liver, so aflatoxicosis primarily is a hepatic disease. Conditions increasing the likelihood of aflatoxicosis in humans include limited availability of food, environmental conditions that favour mould growth on foodstuffs, and lack of regulatory systems for aflatoxin monitoring and control.

A regular diet including apiaceous vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, celery, and parsley may reduce the carcinogenic effects of aflatoxin.

There is no specific antidote for aflatoxicosis. Symptomatic and supportive care tailored to the severity of the liver disease may include intravenous fluids with dextrose, active vitamin K, B vitamins, and a restricted, but high-quality protein diet with adequate carbohydrate content.

=== In other animals ===
In dogs, aflatoxin has potential to lead to liver disease. Low levels of aflatoxin exposure require continuous consumption for several weeks to months in order for signs of liver dysfunction to appear. Some articles have suggested the toxic level in dog food is 100–300 ppb and requires continuous exposure or consumption for a few weeks to months to develop aflatoxicosis. No information is available to suggest that recovered dogs will later succumb to an aflatoxin-induced disease.

Turkeys are extremely susceptible to aflatoxicosis. Recent studies have revealed that this is due to the efficient cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism of aflatoxin B1 in the liver of turkeys and deficient glutathione-S-transferase mediated detoxification.

Some studies on pregnant hamsters showed a significant relationship between exposure of aflatoxin B1 (4 mg/kg, single dose) and the appearance of developmental anomalies in their offspring.

In 2005, Diamond Pet Foods discovered aflatoxin in a product manufactured at their facility in Gaston, South Carolina. In 23 states, Diamond voluntarily recalled 19 products formulated with corn and manufactured in the Gaston facility. Testing of more than 2,700 finished product samples conducted by laboratories confirmed that only two date codes of two adult dog formulas had the potential to be toxic.

In December 2020 and January 2021, Midwestern Pet Foods recalled dog food that contained fatal levels of aflatoxin. As many as 70 dogs had died from aflatoxin poisoning by January 12, 2021.
== Detection in humans ==
There are two principal techniques that have been used most often to detect levels of aflatoxin in humans.

The first method is measuring the AFB1-guanine adduct in the urine of subjects. The presence of this breakdown product indicates exposure to aflatoxin B1 during the past 24 hours. This technique measures only recent exposure, however. Due to the half-life of this metabolite, the level of AFB1-guanine measured may vary from day to day, based on diet, it is not ideal for assessing long-term exposure.

Another technique that has been used is a measurement of the AFB1-albumin adduct level in the blood serum. This approach provides a more integrated measure of exposure over several weeks or months.

==List of outbreaks==
International sources of commercial peanut butter, cooking oils (e.g. olive, peanut and sesame oil), and cosmetics have been identified as contaminated with aflatoxin. In some instances, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), and other analytical methods, revealed a range from 48% to 80% of selected product samples as containing detectable quantities of aflatoxin. In many of these contaminated food products, the aflatoxin exceeded the safe limits of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or other regulatory agency.

<doc id="177304" wikidata="Q203514" url="?curid=177304" title="Heitor Villa-Lobos">
<text>Heitor Villa-Lobos (March 5, 1887November 17, 1959) was a Brazilian composer, conductor, cellist, and classical guitarist described as &quot;the single most significant creative figure in 20th-century Brazilian art music&quot;. Villa-Lobos has become the best-known South American composer of all time. A prolific composer, he wrote numerous orchestral, chamber, instrumental and vocal works, totaling over 2,000 works by his death in 1959. His music was influenced by both Brazilian folk music and stylistic elements from the European classical tradition, as exemplified by his &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; (Brazilian Bach-pieces) and his Chôros. His Etudes for classical guitar (1929) were dedicated to Andrés Segovia, while his &quot;5 Preludes&quot; (1940) were dedicated to his spouse Arminda Neves d&#x27;Almeida, a.k.a. &quot;Mindinha&quot;. Both are important works in the classical guitar repertory.

==Biography==
===Youth and exploration===
Villa-Lobos was born in Rio de Janeiro. His father, Raúl, was a civil servant, an educated man of Spanish extraction, a librarian, and an amateur astronomer and musician. In Villa-Lobos&#x27;s early childhood, Brazil underwent a period of social revolution and modernisation, abolishing slavery in 1888 and overthrowing the Empire of Brazil in 1889. The changes in Brazil were reflected in its musical life: previously European music had been the dominant influence, and the courses at the &quot;Conservatório de Música&quot; were grounded in traditional counterpoint and harmony. Villa-Lobos underwent very little of this formal training. After a few abortive harmony lessons, he learnt music by illicit observation from the top of the stairs of the regular musical evenings at his house arranged by his father. He learned to play cello, clarinet, and classical guitar. When his father died suddenly in 1899 he earned a living for his family by playing in cinema and theatre orchestras in Rio.

Around 1905 Villa-Lobos started explorations of Brazil&#x27;s &quot;dark interior&quot;, absorbing the native Brazilian musical culture. Serious doubt has been cast on some of Villa-Lobos&#x27;s tales of the decade or so he spent on these expeditions, and about his capture and near escape from cannibals, with some believing them to be fabrications or wildly embellished romanticism. After this period, he gave up any idea of conventional training and instead absorbed the musical influences of Brazil&#x27;s indigenous cultures, themselves based on Portuguese and African, as well as American Indian elements. His earliest compositions were the result of improvisations on the classical guitar from this period.

Villa-Lobos played with many local Brazilian street-music bands; he was also influenced by the cinema and Ernesto Nazareth&#x27;s improvised tangos and polkas. For a time Villa-Lobos became a cellist in a Rio opera company, and his early compositions include attempts at Grand Opera. Encouraged by Arthur Napoleão, a pianist and music publisher, he decided to compose seriously.
===Brazilian influences===
On November 12, 1913, Villa-Lobos married the pianist Lucília Guimarães, ended his travels, and began his career as a serious musician. Up until his marriage, he had not learned to play the piano, so his wife taught him the rudiments of the instrument. His music began to be published in 1913. He introduced some of his compositions in a series of occasional chamber concerts (later also orchestral concerts) from 19151921, mainly in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s &quot;Salão Nobre do Jornal do Comércio&quot;.

The music presented at these concerts shows his coming to terms with the conflicting elements in his experience, and overcoming a crisis of identity, as to whether European or Brazilian music would dominate his style. This was decided by 1916, the year in which he composed the symphonic poems &quot;Amazonas&quot; and &quot;Tédio de alvorada&quot;, the first version of what would become &quot;Uirapurú&quot; (although &quot;Amazonas&quot; was not performed until 1929, and &quot;Uirapurú&quot; was only completed in 1934 and first performed in 1935). These works drew from native Brazilian legends and the use of &quot;primitive&quot; folk material.

European influences did still inspire Villa-Lobos. In 1917 Sergei Diaghilev made an impact on tour in Brazil with his Ballets Russes. That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer Darius Milhaud, who was in Rio as secretary to Paul Claudel at the French Legation. Milhaud brought the music of Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and possibly Igor Stravinsky; in return Villa-Lobos introduced Milhaud to Brazilian street music. In 1918, he also met the pianist Arthur Rubinstein, who became a lifelong friend and champion; this meeting prompted Villa-Lobos to write more piano music.

In about 1918 Villa-Lobos abandoned the use of opus numbers for his compositions as a constraint to his pioneering spirit. With the piano suite &quot;Carnaval das crianças&quot; (Children&#x27;s carnival) of 191920, Villa-Lobos liberated his style altogether from European Romanticism: the suite, in eight movements with the finale written for piano duet, depicts eight characters or scenes from Rio&#x27;s Lenten Carnival.
In February 1922, a festival of modern art took place in São Paulo and Villa-Lobos contributed performances of his own works. The press were unsympathetic and the audience were not appreciative; their mockery was encouraged by Villa-Lobos&#x27;s being forced by a foot infection to wear one carpet slipper. The festival ended with Villa-Lobos&#x27;s &quot;Quarteto simbólico&quot;, composed as an impression of Brazilian urban life.

In July 1922, Rubinstein gave the first performance of the piano suite &quot;A Prole do Bebê&quot; (The Baby&#x27;s Family), composed in 1918. There had recently been an attempted military coup on Copacabana Beach, and places of entertainment had been closed for days; the public possibly wanted something less intellectually demanding, and the piece was booed. Villa-Lobos was philosophical about it, and Rubinstein later reminisced that the composer said, &quot;I am still too good for them.&quot; The piece has been called &quot;the first enduring work of Brazilian modernism&quot;.

Rubinstein suggested that Villa-Lobos tour abroad, and in 1923 he set out for Paris. His avowed aim was to exhibit his exotic sound world rather than to study. Just before he left he completed his Nonet (for ten players and chorus) which was first performed after his arrival in the French capital. He stayed in Paris in 192324 and 192730, and there he met influential residents including Edgard Varèse, Pablo Picasso, Leopold Stokowski and Aaron Copland. Parisian concerts of his music made a strong impression.

In the 1920s, Villa-Lobos also met the Spanish classical guitarist Andrés Segovia, who commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded by writing a set of twelve such pieces, each based on a tiny detail or figure played by Brazilian itinerant street musicians (&quot;chorões&quot;), transformed into an &quot;étude&quot; that is not merely didactic. The music of chorões also provided the initial inspiration for his &quot;Chôros&quot;, a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929. The first European performance of &quot;Chôros No. 10&quot;, in Paris, caused a storm: L.Chevaillier wrote of it in &quot;Le Monde musical&quot;, &quot;[it is] an art ... to which we must now give a new name.&quot;

===Vargas era===
In 1930, Villa-Lobos, who was in Brazil to conduct, planned to return to Paris. One of the consequences of the revolution of that year was that money could no longer be taken out of the country, and so he had no means of paying any rents abroad. Thus forced to stay in Brazil, he arranged concerts instead around São Paulo, and composed patriotic and educational music. In 1932, he became director of the &quot;Superintendência de Educação Musical e Artística&quot; (SEMA), and his duties included arranging concerts including the Brazilian premieres of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; and Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot; as well as Brazilian compositions. His position at SEMA led him to compose mainly patriotic and propagandist works. His series of &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; were a notable exception.

In 1936, at the age of forty-nine, Villa-Lobos left his wife, and became romantically involved with Arminda Neves d&#x27;Almeida, who remained his companion until death. Arminda eventually took on the name Villa-Lobos, though Villa-Lobos never divorced his first wife. After Villa-Lobos&#x27; death, Arminda became the Director of the &quot;Museu Villa-Lobos&quot; in 1960, until her death in 1985. Arminda was herself a musician and a significant influence on Villa-Lobos. He also dedicated a good number of works to her, including the &quot;Ciclo brasileiro&quot; and many of the &quot;Chôros&quot;.

Villa-Lobos&#x27;s writings during the presidency of Getúlio Vargas (1930–1945) include propaganda for Brazilian nationhood (&quot;brasilidade&quot;), and teaching and theoretical works. His &quot;Guia Prático&quot; ran to 11volumes, &quot;Solfejos&quot; (two volumes, 1942 and 1946) contained vocal exercises, and &quot;Canto Orfeônico&quot; (1940 and 1950) contained patriotic songs for schools and for civic occasions. His music for the film &quot;O Descobrimento do Brasil&quot; (The Discovery of Brazil) of 1936, which included versions of earlier compositions, was arranged into orchestral suites, and includes a depiction of the first mass in Brazil in a setting for double choir.

Villa-Lobos published &quot;A Música Nacionalista no Govêrno Getúlio Vargas&quot; 1941, in which he characterised the nation as a sacred entity whose symbols (including its flag, motto and national anthem) were inviolable. Villa-Lobos was the chair of a committee whose task was to define a definitive version of the Brazilian national anthem.

After 1937, during the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; period when Vargas seized power by decree, Villa-Lobos continued producing patriotic works directly accessible to mass audiences. Independence Day on September 7, 1939, involved 30,000 children singing the national anthem and items arranged by Villa-Lobos. For the 1943 celebrations he also composed the ballet &quot;Dança da terra&quot;, which the authorities deemed unsuitable until it was revised. The 1943 celebrations did include Villa-Lobos&#x27;s hymn &quot;Invocação em defesa da pátria&quot; shortly after Brazil&#x27;s declaring war on Germany and its allies.

Villa-Lobos&#x27;s status damaged his reputation among certain schools of musicians, among them disciples of new European trends such as serialismwhich was effectively off limits in Brazil until the 1960s. This crisis was, in part, due to some Brazilian composers finding it necessary to reconcile Villa-Lobos&#x27;s own liberation of Brazilian music from European models in the 1920s with a style of music they felt to be more universal.

===Composer in demand===
Vargas fell from power in 1945. Villa-Lobos was able, after the end of the war, to travel abroad again; he returned to Paris, and also made regular visits to the United States as well as travelling to Great Britain, and Israel. He received a huge number of commissions, and fulfilled many of them despite failing health. He composed concertos for piano, cello (the second one in 1953), classical guitar (in 1951 for Segovia, who refused to play it until the composer provided a cadenza in 1956), harp (for Nicanor Zabaleta in 1953) and harmonica (for John Sebastian, Sr. in 1955–56). Other commissions included his Symphony No. 11 (for the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1955), and the opera &quot;Yerma&quot; (1955–56) based on the play by Federico García Lorca. His prolific output of this period prompted criticisms of note-spinning and banality: critical reactions to his Piano Concerto No. 5 included the comments &quot;bankrupt&quot; and &quot;piano tuners&#x27; orgy&quot;, &quot;raked the very depths of banality&quot;, &quot;nothing ... but soupy textures or a bedraggled romantic idea&quot;, and &quot;truly the kind of music that should never get written, still less performed&quot;.

His music for the film &quot;Green Mansions&quot; starring Audrey Hepburn and Anthony Perkins, commissioned by MGM in 1958, earned Villa-Lobos , and he conducted the soundtrack recording himself. The film was in production for many years. Originally to be directed by Vincente Minnelli, it was taken over by Hepburn&#x27;s husband Mel Ferrer. MGM decided to use only part of Villa-Lobos&#x27;s music in the actual film, turning instead to Bronisław Kaper for the rest of the music. From the score, Villa-Lobos compiled a work for soprano soloist, male chorus, and orchestra, which he titled &quot;Forest of the Amazon&quot; and recorded it in 1959 in stereo with Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayão, an unidentified male chorus, and the Symphony of the Air for United Artists Records. The recording was issued both on LP and reel-to-reel tape (United Artist UAC 8007, stereo 7 1/2 IPS).

In June 1959, Villa-Lobos alienated many of his fellow musicians by expressing disillusionment, saying in an interview that Brazil was &quot;dominated by mediocrity&quot;. In November he died in Rio; his state funeral was the final major civic event in that city before the capital transferred to Brasília. He is buried in the &quot;Cemitério São João Batista&quot; in Rio de Janeiro.

==Music==

His earliest pieces originated in guitar improvisations, for example &quot;Panqueca&quot; (Pancake) of 1900. The concert series of 191521 included first performances of pieces demonstrating originality and virtuosic technique. Some of these pieces are early examples of elements of importance throughout his œuvre. His attachment to the Iberian Peninsula is demonstrated in &quot;Canção Ibéria&quot; of 1914 and in orchestral transcriptions of some of Enrique Granados&#x27; piano &quot;Goyescas&quot; (1918, now lost). Other themes that were to recur in his later work include the anguish and despair of the piece &quot;Desesperança – Sonata Phantastica e Capricciosa no. 1&quot; (1915), a violin sonata including &quot;histrionic and violently contrasting emotions&quot;, the birds of &quot;L&#x27;oiseau blessé d&#x27;une flèche&quot; (1913), the mother–child relationship (not usually a happy one in Villa-Lobos&#x27;s music) in &quot;Les mères&quot; of 1914, and the flowers of &quot;Suíte floral&quot; for piano of 191618 which reappeared in &quot;Distribuição de flores&quot; for flute and classical guitar of 1937.

Reconciling European tradition and Brazilian influences was also an element that bore fruit more formally later. His earliest published work &quot;Pequena suíte&quot; for cello and piano of 1913 shows a love for the cello, but is not notably Brazilian, although it contains elements that were to resurface later. His three-movement &quot;Suíte graciosa&quot; of 1915 (expanded to six movements c. 1947 to become his String Quartet No. 1) is influenced by European opera, while &quot;Três danças características (africanas e indígenas)&quot; of 191416 for piano, later arranged for octet and subsequently orchestrated, is radically influenced by the tribal music of the Caripunas Indians of Mato Grosso.
With his tone poems &quot;Amazonas&quot; (1917, first performed in Paris in 1929) and &quot;Uirapurú&quot; (1917, first performed 1935) he created works dominated by indigenous Brazilian influences. The works use Brazilian folk tales and characters, imitations of the sounds of the jungle and its fauna, imitations of the sound of the nose-flute by the violinophone, and not least imitations of the uirapuru bird itself.

His meeting with Arthur Rubinstein in 1918 prompted Villa-Lobos to compose piano music such as &quot;Simples coletânea&quot; of 1919—which was possibly influenced by Rubinstein&#x27;s playing of Ravel and Scriabin on his South American tours—and &quot;Bailado infernal&quot; of 1920. The latter piece includes the tempi and expression markings &quot;vertiginoso e frenético&quot;, &quot;infernal&quot; and &quot;mais vivo ainda&quot; (faster still).

&quot;Carnaval das crianças&quot; of 191920 saw Villa-Lobos&#x27;s mature style emerge; unconstrained by the use of traditional formulae or any requirement for dramatic tension, the piece at times imitates a mouth organ, children&#x27;s dances, a harlequinade, and ends with an impression of the carnival parade. This work was orchestrated in 1929 with new linking passages and a new title, &quot;Momoprecoce&quot;. Naïveté and innocence is also heard in the piano suites &quot;A Prole do Bebê&quot; (The Baby&#x27;s Family) of 191821.

Around this time he also fused urban Brazilian influences and impressions, for example in his &quot;Quarteto simbólico&quot; of 1921. He included the urban street music of the &quot;chorões&quot;, who were groups containing flute, clarinet and cavaquinho (a Brazilian guitar), and often also including ophicleide, trombones or percussion. Villa-Lobos occasionally joined such bands. Early works showing this influence were incorporated into the &quot;Suite populaire brésilienne&quot; of 190812 assembled by his publisher, and more mature works include the &quot;Sexteto místico&quot; (1955, replacing a lost and probably unfinished one begun in 1917), and his setting of the poetry of Mário de Andrade and Catulo da Paxão Cearense in the &quot;Canções típicas brasileiras&quot; of 1919. His classical guitar studies are also influenced by the music of the &quot;chorões&quot;.

All the elements mentioned so far are fused in Villa-Lobos&#x27;s Nonet. Subtitled &quot;Impressão rápida do todo o Brasil&quot; (A Brief Impression of the Whole of Brazil), the title of the work denotes it as ostensibly chamber music, but it is scored for flute/piccolo, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, celesta, harp, piano, a large percussion battery requiring at least two players, and a mixed chorus.

In Paris, his musical vocabulary established, Villa-Lobos solved the problem of his works&#x27; form. It was perceived as an incongruity that his Brazilian impressionism should be expressed in the form of quartets and sonatas. He developed new forms to free his imagination from the constraints of conventional musical development such as that required in sonata form. The multi-sectional &quot;poema&quot; form may be seen in the &quot;Suite for Voice and Violin&quot;, which is somewhat like a triptych, and the &quot;Poema da criança e sua mamã&quot; for voice, flute, clarinet, and cello (1923). The extended &quot;Rudepoêma&quot; for piano, written for Rubinstein, is a multi-layered work, often requiring notation on several staves, and is both experimental and demanding. Wright calls it &quot;the most impressive result&quot; of this formal development. The &quot;Ciranda&quot;, or &quot;Cirandinha&quot; is a stylised treatment of simple Brazilian folk melodies in a wide variety of moods. A &quot;ciranda&quot; is a child&#x27;s singing game, but Villa-Lobos&#x27;s treatment in the works he gave this title are sophisticated. Another form was the &quot;Chôros&quot;. Villa-Lobos composed more than a dozen works with this title for various instruments, mostly in the years 19241929. He described them as &quot;a new form of musical composition&quot;, a transformation of the Brazilian music and sounds &quot;by the personality of the composer&quot;.

He also composed between 1930 and 1945 nine pieces he called &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; (Brazilian Bachian pieces). These take the forms and nationalism of the &quot;Chôros&quot;, and add the composer&#x27;s love of Bach. He incorporated neoclassicism in his nationalistic style. Villa-Lobos&#x27;s use of archaisms was not new (an early example is his &quot;Pequena suíte&quot; for cello and piano of 1913). The pieces evolved over the period rather than being conceived as a whole, some of them being revised or added to. They contain some of his most popular music, such as No.5 for soprano and eight cellos (19381945), and No.2 for orchestra of 1930 (the &quot;Tocata&quot; movement of which is &quot;Otrenzinho do caipira&quot;, &quot;The little train of the Caipira&quot;). They also show the composer&#x27;s love for the tonal qualities of the cello, both No.1 and No.5 being scored for no other instruments. In these works the often harsh dissonances of his earlier music are less evident: or, as Simon Wright puts it, they are &quot;sweetened&quot;. The transformation of &quot;Chôros&quot; into &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; is demonstrated clearly by the comparison of No.6 for flute and bassoon with the earlier &quot;Chôros No. 2&quot; for flute and clarinet. The dissonances of the later piece are more controlled, the forward direction of the music easier to discern. &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; No.9 takes the concept so far as to be an abstract &quot;Prelude and Fugue&quot;, a complete distillation of the composer&#x27;s national influences. Villa-Lobos eventually recorded all nine of these works for EMI in Paris, mostly with the musicians of the French National Orchestra; these were originally issued on LPs and later reissued on CDs. He also recorded the first section of &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras No.5&quot; with Bidu Sayão and a group of cellists for Columbia.

During his period at SEMA, Villa-Lobos composed five string quartets, nos. 5to9, which explored avenues opened by his public music that dominated his output. He also wrote more music for Segovia, the &quot;Cinq préludes&quot;, which also demonstrate a further formalisation of his composition style. After the fall of the Vargas government, Villa-Lobos returned full-time to composition, resuming a prolific rate of completing works. His concertos—particularly those for the classical guitar, the harp, and the harmonica—are examples of his earlier &quot;poema&quot; form. The Harp Concerto is a large work, and shows a new propensity to focus on a small detail, then to fade it and bring another detail to the foreground. This technique also occurs in his final opera, &quot;Yerma&quot;, which contains a series of scenes each of which establishes an atmosphere, similarly to the earlier &quot;Momoprecoce&quot;.

Villa-Lobos&#x27;s final major work was the music for the film &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (though in the end, most of his score was replaced with music by Bronisław Kaper) and its arrangement as &quot;Floresta do Amazonas&quot; for orchestra, as well as some short songs issued separately. In 1957, he wrote a Seventeenth String Quartet, whose austerity of technique and emotional intensity &quot;provide a eulogy to his craft&quot;. His &quot;Bendita Sabedoria&quot;, a sequence of &quot;a cappella&quot; chorales written in 1958, is a similarly simple setting of Latin biblical texts. These works lack the pictorialism of his more public music.

Except for the lost works, the Nonet, the two concerted works for violin and orchestra, &quot;Suite for Piano and Orchestra&quot;, a number of the symphonic poems, most of his choral music and all of the operas, his music is well represented on the world&#x27;s recital and concert stages and on compact disc.

<doc id="177307" wikidata="Q537152" url="?curid=177307" title="Arnold Toynbee (historian, born 1852)">
<text>Arnold Toynbee (; 23 August 18529 March 1883) was an English economic historian also noted for his social commitment and desire to improve the living conditions of the working classes.

==Life and career==
Toynbee was born in Syria, the son of the physician Joseph Toynbee, a pioneering otolaryngologist. One of nine children, his sister was the bacteriologist Grace Frankland, and his brother was Paget Toynbee, the Dante scholar.

Toynbee was the uncle, via his brother Harry Valpy Toynbee, of universal historian Arnold Joseph Toynbee (1889–1975). The two are often confused for each other due to the similarity of their names.

Toynbee attended public schools in Blackheath and Woolwich. In 1873 he began to study political economy at Oxford University, first at Pembroke College and from 1875 at Balliol College, where he went on to teach after his graduation in 1878. He was deeply influenced by John Ruskin while at Oxford. W. G. Collingwood states that Toynbee was one of Ruskin&#x27;s warmest admirers and ablest pupils. He further notes that the philanthropic work of Toynbee truly illustrated the teaching of one of Ruskin&#x27;s greatest books, &quot;Unto This Last&quot;.
 His lectures on the history of the Industrial Revolution in 18th- and 19th-century Britain proved widely influential; in fact, Toynbee coined, or at least effectively popularised, the term &quot;Industrial Revolution&quot; in the Anglophone world—in Germany and elsewhere it had been brought into circulation earlier by Friedrich Engels, also under the impression of the industrial changes in Britain.

He married the college administrator Charlotte Atwood on 26 June 1879. His wife was 12 years his senior and a cousin of Harold Davidson, the famous Rector of Stiffkey.

Toynbee died in 1883, at age 30. His health had rapidly deteriorated, probably due to exhaustion by excessive work . Frederick Rogers notes that the publication of Henry George&#x27;s &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; may be said to have brought about Toynbee&#x27;s death:
===Toynbee genealogy===
The Toynbees have been prominent in British intellectual society for several generations &quot;(this diagram is not a comprehensive Toynbee family tree)&quot;:




==Economic history==
According to Toynbee, applying the historical method in economics would reveal how supposedly universal economic laws were, in fact, relative. For example, he argued that, despite commonly held beliefs, free trade was not generally advantageous in itself, but only under certain circumstances, which should not be considered absolute. Toynbee considered few laws universally true, such as the law of diminishing returns. Therefore, there were no universal rules as to how strongly the state should interfere in the marketplace; all depended on the situation and varying degrees of regulation could be appropriate.

Another idea Toynbee dismissed was that free competition was universally beneficial to economic and societal progress, especially as reflected in its apotheosis in Social Darwinism, which promoted laissez-faire capitalism. Toynbee did not equate &quot;a struggle for mere existence and a struggle for a particular kind of existence&quot;. From the very beginning of history, he argued, all human civilisation was essentially designed to &quot;interfere with this brute struggle. We intend to modify the violence of the fight, and to prevent the weak being trampled under foot.&quot; Although economic competition does have its advantages, being the driving force behind technical progress, these were &quot;gained at the expense of an enormous waste of human life and labour, which might be avoided by regulation&quot;. Toynbee suggested a differentiation between competition in production on the one hand, and competition in the distribution of goods on the other:

... the struggle of men to outvie one another in production is beneficial to the community; their struggle over the division of the joint produce is not. The stronger side will dictate its own terms; and as a matter of fact, in the early days of competition, the capitalists used all their power to oppress the labourers, and drove down wages to starvation point. This kind of competition has to be checked; there is no historical instance of its having lasted long without being modified either by combination or legislation, or both. In England both remedies are in operation, the former through Trades Unions, the latter through factory legislation.

In itself, a market based on competition was neither good nor bad, but like &quot;a stream whose strength and direction have to be observed, that embankments may be thrown up within which it may do its work harmlessly and beneficially&quot;. However, in the early phase of industrial capitalism &quot;it came to be believed in as a gospel, ... from which it was regarded as little long of immoral to depart&quot;.

==Social commitment==
For Toynbee, early industrial capitalism and the situation of the working class in it was not just a subject of ivory-tower studies; he was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the labourer. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and co-operatives. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of Whitechapel, in East London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working-class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working-class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.

Inspired by his ideas, Samuel Augustus Barnett and Henrietta Barnett founded the first university settlement in 1884, shortly after Toynbee&#x27;s death; it was named Toynbee Hall in his honour. A centre for social reform, Toynbee Hall was on Commercial Street, Whitechapel. It remains active today. The concept was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of British society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, social mobility was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class. Early chairs of trustees included Philip Lyttelton Gell and Lord Alfred Milner. Toynbee Hall attracted many students, especially from Oxford&#x27;s Wadham College and Balliol College, where Toynbee had taught.

In 1916, the Arnold Toynbee House in New York was founded by a group of young adults who were part of the Stevenson Club at Madison House and with the help of philanthropist Rose Gruening. Eight years later, the settlement house was renamed Grand Street Settlement.

==Views on the Industrial Revolution==
Toynbee is widely accepted as the historian who ushered the expression &quot;the industrial revolution&quot; into the English language. Although French and German commentators had used this term in the early nineteenth century, English use had been rare and inconsistent until the posthumous publication of Toynbee&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England&quot;.

According to Toynbee, &quot;the essence of the Industrial Revolution&quot; was &quot;the substitution of competition for the medieval regulations which had previously controlled the production and distribution of wealth&quot;. Among its components were an &quot;agrarian revolution&quot; that produced &quot;the alienation between farmer and labourer&quot; and in the manufacturing world, the appearance of a &quot;new class of great capitalist employers&quot;. &quot;The old relations between masters and men disappeared, and a &#x27;cash nexus&#x27; was substituted for the human tie.&quot; Summing up his interpretation, Toynbee wrote, &quot;the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; and the steam-engine...destroyed the old world and built a new one.&quot; For Toynbee, this coupling seemed self-evident. Steam-powered factories, the &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;, competition, the cash-nexus and the rise of pauperism formed part of a single phenomenon.

In response to this bleak scenario, Toynbee proposed a test for when the state should become involved in the regulation of an economic or social sphere of society to even the balance between industry and labour. He proposed the &quot;Radical Creed&quot;, which,

as I understand it, is this: We have not abandoned our old belief in liberty, justice, and Self-help, but we say that under certain conditions the people cannot help themselves, and that then they should be helped by the State representing directly the whole people. In giving this State help, we make three conditions: first, the matter must be one of primary social importance; next, it must be proved to be practicable; thirdly, the State interference must not diminish self-reliance. Even if the chance should arise of removing a great social evil, nothing must be done to weaken those habits of individual self-reliance and voluntary association which have built up the greatness of the English people.

<doc id="177309" wikidata="Q1823479" url="?curid=177309" title="Lighting design">
<text>In theatre, a lighting designer (or LD) works with the director, choreographer, set designer, costume designer, and sound designer to create the lighting, atmosphere, and time of day for the production in response to the text while keeping in mind issues of visibility, safety, and cost. The LD also works closely with the stage manager or show control programming, if show control systems are used in that production. Outside stage lighting, the job of a lighting designer can be much more diverse, and they can be found working on rock and pop tours, corporate launches, art installations, or lighting effects at sporting events.

==During pre-production==
The role of the lighting designer varies greatly within professional and amateur theater. For a Broadway show, a touring production and most regional and small productions the LD is usually an outside freelance specialist hired early in the production process. Smaller theater companies may have a resident lighting designer responsible for most of the company&#x27;s productions or rely on a variety of freelance or even volunteer help to light their productions. At the off-Broadway or off-off-Broadway level, the LD will occasionally be responsible for much of the hands-on technical work (such as hanging instruments, programming the light board, etc.) that would be the work of the lighting crew in a larger theater.

The LD will read the script carefully and make notes on changes in place and time between scene—and will have meetings (called design or production meetings) with the director, designers, stage manager, and production manager to discuss ideas for the show and establish budget and scheduling details. The LD will also attend several later rehearsals to observe the way the actors are being directed to use the stage area (&#x27;blocking&#x27;) during different scenes and will receive updates from the stage manager on any changes that occur. The LD will also ensure that they have an accurate plan of the theatre&#x27;s lighting positions and a list of their equipment, as well as an accurate copy of the set design, especially the ground plan and section. The LD must consider the show&#x27;s mood and the director&#x27;s vision in creating a lighting design.

To help the LD communicate artistic vision, they may employ renderings, storyboards, photographs, reproductions of artwork, or mockups of effects to help communicate how the lighting should look. Various forms of paperwork are essential for the LD to successfully communicate their design to various production team members. Examples of typical paperwork include cue sheets, light plots, instrument schedules, shop orders, and focus charts. Cue sheets communicate the placement of cues that the LD has created for the show, using artistic terminology rather than technical language, and information on exactly when each cue is called so that the stage manager and the assistants know when and where to call the cue. Cue sheets are of the most value to stage management.

The light plot is a scale drawing that communicates the location of lighting fixtures and lighting positions so a team of electricians can independently install the lighting system. Next to each instrument on the plan will be information for any color gel, gobo, or other accessories that need to go with it, and its channel number. Often, paperwork listing all of this information is also generated by using a program such as Lightwright. The lighting designer uses this paperwork to aid in the visualization of not only ideas but also simple lists to assist the master electrician during load-in, focus, and technical rehearsals. Professional LDs generally use special computer-aided design packages to create accurate and easily readable drafted plots that can be swiftly updated as necessary. The LD will discuss the plot with the show&#x27;s production manager and the theatre&#x27;s master electrician or technical director to make sure there are no unforeseen problems during load-in.

The lighting designer is responsible, in conjunction with the production&#x27;s independently hired &quot;production electrician&quot;, who will interface with the theater&#x27;s master electrician, for directing the theater&#x27;s electrics crew in the realization of their designs during the technical rehearsals. After the Electricians have hung, circuited, and patched the lighting units, the LD will direct the focusing (pointing, shaping and sizing of the light beams) and gelling (coloring) of each unit.

After focus has occurred the LD usually sits at a temporary desk (tech table) in the theater (typically on the center line in the middle of the house) where they have a good view of the stage and work with the light board operator, who will either be seated alongside them at a portable control console or talk via headset to the control room. At the tech table, the LD will generally use a Magic Sheet, which is a pictorial layout of how the lights relate to the stage, so they can have quick access to channel numbers that control particular lighting instruments. The LD may also have a copy of the light plot and channel hookup, a remote lighting console, a computer monitor connected to the light board (so they can see what the board op is doing), and a headset, though in smaller theatres this is less common. There may be a time allowed for pre-lighting or &quot;pre-cueing&quot;, a practice that is often done with people known as Light Walkers who stand in for performers so the LD can see what the light looks like on bodies. At an arranged time, the performers arrive and the production is worked through in chronological order, with occasional stops to correct sound, lighting, entrances, etc.; known as a &quot;cue-to-cue&quot; or tech rehearsal. The lighting designer will work constantly with the board operator to refine the lighting states as the technical rehearsal continues, but because the focus of a &quot;tech&quot; rehearsal is the production&#x27;s technical aspects, the LD may require the performers to pause (&quot;hold&quot;) frequently. Nevertheless, any errors of focusing or changes to the lighting plan are corrected only when the performers are not onstage. These changes take place during &#x27;work&#x27; or &#x27;note&#x27; calls. The LD only attends these notes calls if units are hung or rehung and require additional focusing. The LD or assistant lighting director (also known as the ALD, see below for description) will be in charge if in attendance. If the only work to be done is maintenance (i.e. changing a lamp or burnt out gel) then the production or master electrician will be in charge and will direct the electrics crew.

After the tech process, the performance may (or may not, depending on time constraints) go into dress rehearsal without a ticketed audience or previews with a ticketed audience. During this time, if the cueing is finished, the LD will sit in the audience and take notes on what works and what needs changing. At this point, the stage manager will begin to take over the work of calling cues for the light board op to follow. Generally, the LD will stay on the headset, and may still have a monitor connected to the light board in case of problems, or will be in the control booth with the board operator when a monitor is not available. Changes will often occur during notes call, but if serious problems occur, the performance may be halted and the issue will be resolved.

Once the show is open to the public, the lighting designer will often stay and watch several performances of the show, making notes each night and making desired changes the next day during notes call. If the show is still in previews, then the LD will make changes, but once the production officially opens, normally, the lighting designer will not make further changes.

Changes should not be made after the lighting design is finished, and never without the LD&#x27;s approval. There may be times when changes are necessary after the production has officially opened. Reasons for changes after opening night include: casting changes; significant changes in blocking; addition, deletion or rearrangement of scenes; or the tech and/or preview period (if there was a preview period) was too short to accommodate as thorough a cueing as was needed (this is particularly common in dance productions). If significant changes need to be made, the LD will come in and make them, however, if only smaller changes are needed, the LD may opt to send the ALD. If a show runs for a particularly long time then the LD may come in periodically to check the focus of each lighting instrument and if they are retaining their color (some gel, especially saturated gel, loses its richness and can fade or &#x27;burn out&#x27; over time). The LD may also sit in on a performance to make sure that the cues are still being called at the right place and time. The goal is often to finish by the opening of the show, but what is most important is that the LD and the directors believe that the design is finished to each&#x27;s satisfaction. If that happens to be by opening night, then after opening no changes are normally made to that particular production run at that venue. The general maintenance of the lighting rig then becomes the responsibility of the master electrician.

==In small theatres==
It is uncommon for a small theatre to have a very large technical crew, as there is less work to do. Many times, the lighting crew of a small theater will consist of a single lighting designer and one to three people, who collectively are in charge of hanging, focusing, and patching all lighting instruments. The lighting designer, in this situation, commonly works directly with this small team, fulfilling the role of both master electrician and lighting designer. Many times the designer will directly participate in the focusing of lights. The same crew will generally also program cues and operate the light board during rehearsals and performances. In some cases, the light board and sound board are operated by the same person, depending on the complexity of the show. The lighting designer may also take on other roles in addition to lights when they are finished hanging lights and programming cues on the board.

==Advances in visualization and presentation==
As previously mentioned, it is difficult to fully communicate the intent of a lighting design before all the lights are installed and all the cues are written. With the advancement in computer processing and visualization software, lighting designers are now able to create computer-generated images (CGI) that represent their ideas. The lighting designer enters the light plot into the visualization software and then enters the ground plan of the theater and set design, giving as much three-dimensional data as possible (which helps in creating complete renderings). This creates a 3D model in computer space that can be lit and manipulated. Using the software, the LD can use the lights from his plot to create actual lighting in the 3D model with the ability to define parameters such as color, focus, gobo, beam angle etc. The designer can then take renderings or &quot;snapshots&quot; of various looks that can then be printed out and shown to the director and other members of the design team.

==Mockups and lighting scale models==
In addition to computer visualization, either full-scale or small-scale mockups are a good method for depicting a lighting designer&#x27;s ideas. Fiber optic systems such as LightBox or Luxam allow a users to light a scale model of the set. For example, a set designer can create a model of the set in 1/4&quot; scale, and the lighting designer can then take the fiber optic cables and attach them to scaled-down lighting units that can accurately replicate the beam angles of specified lighting fixtures. These &#x27;mini lights&#x27; can then be attached to cross pieces simulating different lighting positions. Fiber optic fixtures have the capacity to simulate attributes of full scale theatrical lighting fixtures including; color, beam angle, intensity, and gobos. The most sophisticated fiber optic systems are controllable through computer software or a DMX controlled Light board. This gives the lighting designer the ability to mock up real-time lighting effects as they will look during the show.

==Additional members of the lighting design team==
If the production is large or especially complex, the lighting designer may hire additional lighting professionals to help execute the design.

===Associate lighting designer===
The associate lighting designer (associate LD) will assist the lighting designer in creating and executing the lighting design. While the duties that an LD may expect the associate LD to perform may differ from person to person, usually the Ass&#x27;t LD will do the following:
* Attend design and production meetings with or in place of the LD
* Attend rehearsals with or in place of LD and take notes of specific design ideas and tasks that the lighting department needs to accomplish
* Assist the LD in generating the light plot, channel hookup and sketches
* If needed, the Associate may need to take the set drawings and put them into a CAD program to be manipulated by the LD (however, this job is usually given to the assistant LD if there is one).
* The assistant LD may be in charge of running focus, and may even direct where the lights are to be focused.
* The associate is generally authorized to speak on behalf of the LD and can make creative and design decisions when needed (and when authorized by the LD). This is one of the biggest differences between the Associate and the Assistant.

===Assistant lighting designer===
The assistant lighting designer (assistant LD) assists the lighting designer and associate lighting designer. Depending on the particular arrangement the ALD may report directly to the LD, or they may in essence be the Associate&#x27;s assistant. There also may be more than one assistant on a show depending on the size of the production. The ALD will usually:
* Attend design and production meetings with the LD or the associate LD
* Attend rehearsals with the LD or the associate LD
* Assist the LD in generating the light plot and channel hookup. If the plot is to be computer generated, the ALD is the one who physically enters the information into the computer.
* The ALD may run errands for the LD such as picking up supplies or getting the light plot printed in large format.
* The ALD will help the Associate LD in running focus.
* The ALD may take Focus Charts during focus.
* Track and coordinate followspots (if any exist for the production) and generate paperwork to aid in their cueing and color changes.
* In rare instances the ALD may be the light board operator.

<doc id="177312" wikidata="Q1486412" url="?curid=177312" title="Elements of the Philosophy of Right">
<text>Elements of the Philosophy of Right () is a work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel published in 1820, though the book&#x27;s original title page dates it to 1821. Hegel&#x27;s most mature statement of his legal, moral, social and political philosophy, it is an expansion upon concepts only briefly dealt with in the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences&quot;, published in 1817 (and again in 1827 and 1830). Law provides for Hegel the cornerstone of the modern state. As such, he criticized Karl Ludwig von Haller&#x27;s &quot;The Restoration of the Science of the State&quot;, in which the latter claimed that law was superficial, because natural law and the &quot;right of the most powerful&quot; was sufficient. The absence of law characterized for Hegel despotism, whether absolutist or ochlocracist.

==Summary==
The &quot;Philosophy of Right&quot; (as it is usually called) begins with a discussion of the concept of the free will and argues that the free will can realize itself only in the complicated social context of property rights and relations, contracts, moral commitments, family life, the economy, the legal system, and the polity. A person is not truly free, in other words, unless he is a participant in all of these different aspects of the life of the state.

The bulk of the book is devoted to discussing Hegel&#x27;s three spheres or versions of &#x27;right,&#x27; each one larger than the preceding ones and encompassing them. The first sphere is &quot;abstract right&quot; (&quot;Recht&quot;), in which Hegel discusses the idea of &#x27;non-interference&#x27; as a way of respecting others. He deems this insufficient and moves onto the second sphere, &quot;morality&quot; (&quot;Moralität&quot;). Under this, Hegel proposes that humans reflect their own subjectivity of others in order to respect them. The third sphere, &quot;ethical life&quot; (&quot;Sittlichkeit&quot;), is Hegel&#x27;s integration of individual subjective feelings and universal notions of right. Under ethical life, Hegel then launches into a lengthy discussion about family, civil society, and the state.

Hegel also argues that the state itself is subsumed under the higher totality of world history, in which individual states arise, conflict with one another, and eventually fall. The course of history is apparently toward the ever-increasing actualization of freedom; each successive historical epoch corrects certain failures of the earlier ones. At the end of his &quot;Lectures on the Philosophy of History&quot;, Hegel leaves open the possibility that history has yet to accomplish certain tasks related to the inner organization of the state.

== Reception ==
There were a number of issues that arose during the translation of the text. Most notably the phrase that is contained in the addition to §258, which was initially translated as &quot;The state is the march of God through the world&quot; as well as being translated thus: &quot;The existence of the state is the presence of God upon the earth&quot;. From these early translations came the criticism that Hegel justifies authoritarian or even totalitarian forms of government: Giovanni Gentile, whose thought had a strong influence on Mussolini, bases his Hegelian revival on this point. However, Walter Kaufmann argues that the correct translation reads as follows: &quot;It is the way of God in the world, that there should be a state&quot;. This suggests that the state, rather than being godly, is part of the divine strategy, not a mere product of human endeavor. Kaufmann claims that Hegel&#x27;s original meaning of the sentence is not a &quot;carte blanche&quot; for state dominance and brutality but merely a reference to the state&#x27;s importance as part of the process of history.

The preface to the &quot;Philosophy of Right&quot; contains considerable criticism of the philosophy of Jakob Friedrich Fries, who had been a critic of Hegel&#x27;s prior work. Included in this is a suggestion that it is justifiable for the state to censor the writings of philosophers like Fries and welcoming Fries&#x27; loss of his academic position following Fries&#x27; participation in the Wartburg Festival. The inclusion of this passage has led to scholarly debate as to the reason for Hegel&#x27;s advocacy of the kind of censorship the Prussian state had introduced following the murder of August von Kotzebue in the form of the Carlsbad Decrees. Hegel scholars have suggested that the inclusion of these passages was done to satisfy the censors. T.M. Knox argued that, while clearly designed to curry favour with the censors and written well after completion of the work proper, the Preface&#x27;s condemnation of Fries was &quot;nothing new&quot;, that there was no betrayal of his support for the Wartburg Festival principles, rather a mere denunciation of method, while condemnation of Karl Ludwig von Haller (whose work had been burned at Wartburg) remained undisturbed in the body of the work. Stephen Houlgate wrote in The Hegel Reader, which he edited, that the work is now &quot;recognized as one of the greatest works of social and political philosophy ever written.&quot;
