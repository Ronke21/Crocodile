<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Kantō region of Honshu. Chiba Prefecture has a population of 6,278,060 (1 June 2019) and has a geographic area of . Chiba Prefecture borders Ibaraki Prefecture to the north, Saitama Prefecture to the northwest, and Tokyo to the west.

Chiba is the capital and largest city of Chiba Prefecture, with other major cities including Funabashi, Matsudo, Ichikawa and Kashiwa. Chiba Prefecture is located on Japan&#x27;s eastern Pacific coast to the east of Tokyo, and is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world. Chiba Prefecture largely consists of the Bōsō Peninsula, which encloses the eastern side of Tokyo Bay and separates it from Kanagawa Prefecture. Chiba Prefecture is home to Narita International Airport, the Tokyo Disney Resort, and the Keiyō Industrial Zone.

==Etymology==
The name of Chiba Prefecture in Japanese is formed from two kanji characters. The first, , means &quot;thousand&quot; and the second, means &quot;leaf&quot;. The name first appears as an ancient &quot;kuni no miyatsuko&quot;, or regional command office, as the . The name was adopted by a branch of the Taira clan, which moved to the area in present-day Chiba City in the late Heian period. The branch of the Taira adopted the name and became the Chiba clan, and held strong influence over the area of the prefecture until the Azuchi–Momoyama period. The name &quot;Chiba&quot; was chosen for the prefecture at the time its creation in 1873 by the , an early Meiji-period body of prefectural governors that met to decide the structure of local and regional administration in Japan.

The compound word , which refers to the Tokyo-Chiba region, is formed from the second character in Tokyo (), and the second character in Chiba (), which can also be pronounced &quot;kei&quot; and &quot;yō&quot; respectively. This compound is used in terms such as the Keiyō Line, Keiyō Road, Keiyō Rinkai Railway Rinkai Main Line, and the Keiyō Industrial Zone.

== History ==

===Early history===
Chiba Prefecture was settled in prehistoric times, as evidenced by the Jōmon period remains in every part of the region. The prefecture holds the largest &quot;kaizuka&quot; sea shell mounds in Japan, evidence of a large population in the prefecture that relied on the rich marine products of the Pacific Ocean and Tokyo Bay. Kofun burial mounds are found across the prefecture, with the largest group being in Futtsu along Tokyo Bay.

===Asuka and Nara periods===
In the Asuka period (538–710), under the Taika Reform of 645, the administrative structure of present-day Chiba Prefecture changed significantly. The historical province of Fusa Province, which may have covered much of Chiba and Ibaraki prefectures, was divided into two provinces: Shimōsa Province (also called Shimofusa) in the north and Kazusa Province in the southern area. Awa Province at the south of Chiba Prefecture, was separated from Kazusa Prefecture in 718. These administrative units existed until they were abolished and merged into Chiba Prefecture after the Meiji Restoration. The central government established a &quot;kokubunji&quot; provincial temple in each province.

===Heian period===
The imperial court gradually extended its authority over the three provinces in the Nara (710–794) and Heian (794–1185) periods. Shōen feudal estates were established across the three provinces, and the region became an important source of tax revenue, sending agricultural and other products to the capital in Kyoto. As the Heian period progressed, however, the kokushi provincial governors came to exert military power independent of the central government in Kyoto. The Chiba clan broke entirely with the imperial court and was instrumental in the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate.

===Modern period===
Chiba Prefecture was established on June 15, 1873, with the merger of Kisarazu Prefecture and Inba Prefecture.

The militarization of Chiba Prefecture dates to the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). Coastal fortifications were built along Tokyo Bay, as far south as Tateyama, to protect the capital of the Japanese Empire from attack.

In September 1923, the Great Kanto earthquake has cause of widespread destruction in Chiba Prefecture, most notably in the southernmost part of Boso Peninsula, where 1,300 residents were killed, out of 142,000 deaths. Areas of prefecture adjacent to Tokyo saw much damage, and mob violence against Koreans and other ethnic minorities occurred in the chaos after the earthquake in Funabashi, Ichikawa, and other areas.

Koreans, in several neighborhoods of Yachiyo, were killed, and a tower was erected in 1972 near Yachiyodai Station to memorialize those killed in the incident. In the 1930s, the north and central areas of the prefecture became a center of large-scale military production, and military bases and fortifications were constructed in most of the coastal areas of the prefecture. After the United States took control of Saipan, the northern part of the prefecture (most notably the cities of Chiba and Chōshi) was firebombed. Much of the industrialized north of the prefecture was destroyed. Operation Coronet, one of two parts of Operation Downfall, was the planned land invasion of Tokyo in March 1946 by the United States. Coronet planned Kujūkuri Beach as one of two initial landing bases, the other being Hiratsuka via Sagami Bay. The U.S. First Army would enter at Kujūkuri, sweep across the Boso Peninsula, and meet the U.S. Eighth Army at Tokyo. The plan was not carried out since Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

During the Occupation of Japan (1945–1952) Chiba Prefecture was controlled by American forces from the second floor of the prefectural capitol building in the city of Chiba. Numerous other cities in the prefecture, including Chōshi to the north and Tateyama to the south, were used as bases of the occupation; rich agricultural areas across the prefecture somewhat safeguarded the region&#x27;s population from potential food shortages, and starvation, immediately following the war. The immediate post-war period was characterized by carefully planned industrial expansion in the north of the prefecture, and the significant increase of agriculture after land reforms across the prefecture. The Keiyō Industrial Zone brought together smaller, industrial areas along the entirety of the western coast of Chiba Prefecture, and the industrial zone became (and remains) an important center of heavy industrial production and large-scale port facilities in Japan. Cities to the northeast of the prefecture (in close proximity to Tokyo) were connected by rail to the capitol, and became and remain bedroom communities to Tokyo. Narita International Airport began operation in 1978 in Narita, after much protest to replace the overcrowded Tokyo International Airport (Haneda Airport). The majority of international air traffic enters Japan via Chiba Prefecture. The cultivation of rice and vegetables to feed the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area expanded greatly and became a source of income to the northeast and central areas of the prefecture. The expansion of agriculture in the central and southern regions of the prefecture was in contrast to the depopulation of these areas as a significant part of the population moved to the northeast of the prefecture as a result of the urbanization of Japan, a process that continues into the 21st century.

On March 11, 2011, the epicenter of 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu, which caused some damage and affected areas in Chiba Prefecture. While the loss of life and damage to housing and industry was far less than in Tōhoku region, 20 people were killed in Chiba Prefecture, including 13 people were recorded deaths in Asahi. Following the triple disaster, an oil refinery fire broke out at the Cosmo Oil Chiba Refinery, in Ichihara, and was widely covered in the news media. Also, a large liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanks burned at 10 days earlier. Soil liquefaction, in areas of reclaimed land across the northern and western areas of Chiba Prefecture, caused damage to housing. Chiba City, Funabashi, Narashino, and especially Urayasu were greatly affected by triple disaster (such as soil liquefaction, and evidence of radioactive materials caused by the Fukushima radiation). As a result of triple disaster and with permanent damage to housing stock, the population of Chiba Prefecture fell for the first time since Spanish flu pandemic in 1918 and Great Kanto earthquake in 1923.

== Geography ==
Chiba Prefecture borders Ibaraki Prefecture to the north at the Tone River, Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture to the west at the Edo River, the Pacific Ocean to the east and Tokyo Bay around its southern boundary. Most of Chiba lies on the hilly Boso Peninsula, a rice farming region: the east coast, known as the Kujūkuri Plain, is an especially productive area. The most populous zone, in the northwest of the prefecture, is part of the Kantō region that extends into the urban agglomeration of Tokyo and Saitama. The Kuroshio Current flows near Chiba, which keeps it relatively warm in winter and cooler in summer than neighbouring Tokyo.

=== National and prefectural parks ===
With the exception of the large-scale Keiyō Industrial Zone in the northeast, the entirety of the coast of Chiba Prefecture is protected as two quasi-national parks and one prefectural natural park under the national park system of Japan. As of 1 April 2012, 6% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks.

*Suigo-Tsukuba Quasi-National Park encompasses a large area of the Tone River basin and the area around Mount Tsukuba in Ibaraki Prefecture. The park was established in 1953 to protect not only the environment of the area, but also its unique cultural heritage. The mouth of the Tone River and to Cape Inubō and Byōbugaura in northeastern Chiba Prefecture make up the southern part of the park.
*Minami Boso Quasi-National Park was established in 1953 to protect much of the southern coastal areas of Chiba Prefecture from Cape Futtsu on Tokyo Bay to Cape Inubō in northeastern Chiba Prefecture. The park spans across nine administrative districts in the prefecture. Minami Boso Quasi-National Park was established to protect not only the environment of coastal areas, but also the unique cultural assets of associated with these areas, notably the temples associated with Nichiren.

Chiba Prefecture has designated and maintains eight prefectural natural parks to protect both natural and cultural areas, namely the Inba Tega, Kasamori Tsurumai, Kujūkuri, Mineokasankei, Ōtone, Takagoyama, Tomisan, and Yōrō Keikoku Okukiyosumi Prefectural Natural Parks. Cities, towns, and villages in the prefecture also have designated and protected parklands. These parks are maintained for environmental protection as well as providing local recreational facilities.

== Municipalities ==
Since 2010, Chiba consists of 54 municipalities and since 2013, they are 37 cities, 16 towns and one village.


===Mergers===

With the introduction of modern municipalities (cities/towns/villages) in 1889, Chiba&#x27;s districts were subdivided into 43 towns and 315 villages. The first city was created in 1921 when Chiba Town from Chiba District became district-independent as Chiba City. The postwar/1950s Great Shōwa mergers reduced the number of municipalities in Chiba to 101 by 1960, including 14 cities by then. The early 3rd millennium Great Heisei mergers created the current 54 municipalities by 2010.

===Industry===
Chiba Prefecture is home to one of Japan&#x27;s largest industrial areas. Prior to World War II manufacturing in the prefecture was centered on the brewing industry, specifically the production of soy sauce, sake and mirin sweet cooking sake. The manufacturing sector expanded greatly after the war. The prefecture was chosen as the site for a major Kawasaki Steel factory in 1950. In the same period the prefectural government embarked on a large-scale land reclamation program to dredge large plots of waterfront property. The large-scale construction of factories, warehouses, and docks on this reclaimed land around the Tokyo Bay area ultimately formed the Keiyō Industrial Zone. Chiba Prefecture is now 6th in Japan in industrial output with the bulk of the industry focused on the petroleum, chemical, and steel and machine industries. Together, these industries account for forty-five percent of the prefecture&#x27;s exports. In recent years, the government has funded more than eighty industrial parks to bring development further inland as well.

===Agriculture===
The prefecture also boasts Japan&#x27;s overall second-highest agricultural output. Among all the prefectures, only Hokkaidō produces more agricultural products, and Chiba leads Hokkaidō in vegetable production. Peanuts are considered a specialty product of Chiba: 78 per cent of the country&#x27;s peanuts are produced in the prefecture.

Chiba Prefecture leads the nation in the production of several vegetables, including carrots; cabbage; daikon radish; &quot;negi&quot;, the ubiquitous Japanese cultivar of the Welsh onion; loquat; nashi, the Japanese cultivar of the pear, which has a two hundred-year history of cultivation in the prefecture; tomatoes; and spinach It is the nation&#x27;s second largest producer of corn. Rice is also grown, and seaweed, specifically &quot;nori&quot;, is harvested in large quantities from Tokyo Bay.

== Demographics ==

Chiba&#x27;s population is one of the wealthiest in Japan due to the prefecture&#x27;s strong commercial and industrial sectors. Per capita GDP is ¥3.1 million, the fifth-highest in the country. 70% of the population is employed in the service sector, with 25% in industry and 5% in agriculture.

Numerous other municipalities in the prefecture also host museums.

===Libraries and archives===
The Chiba Prefectural Library consists of three libraries. The Chiba Prefectural Central Library is located in the central Chuō-ku ward of Chiba City directly southwest of Chiba Castle and in close proximity to the City of Chiba offices. The Central Library houses a general collection as well as the central research collection for the prefecture. The 
Chiba Prefectural West Library is located in Matsudo next to the Matsudo Museum, and houses a research collection focused on natural history and the fine arts.

The archive maintains a collection of rare books and materials from across the prefecture, as well as materials related to the administration of Chiba Prefecture. Each municipality in the prefecture maintains a local libraries, and many shrines and temples maintain archival collections related to their institutions.

==Cuisine==

The traditional diet of Chiba Prefecture is not fundamentally different from that of the rest of Japan. Chiba Prefecture produces prolific quantities of rice across all areas in the prefecture, vegetables in the northern area of the prefecture, and fish, seafood, and shellfish along the coastal areas of the prefecture. Chōshi has been a major center of worldwide soy sauce production since the Edo period, and the prefecture remains the top producer in Japan. Kikkoman is headquartered in Noda in northwestern Chiba Prefecture. These are all important components of Japanese cuisine.

Certain local products, however, are grown in abundance and have resulted in several dishes unique to the areas. Peanuts, grown in great quantities in the prefecture, appear fresh in markets in the prefecture and are eaten boiled as a snack. Miso paste mixed with peanuts is also produced in Chiba. &quot;Takenoko&quot;, whole bamboo shoot, are harvested in the central part of the Boso Peninsula. The takenoko of Ōtaki lack the concentration of arsenic typically found in uncooked bamboo shoots, and as such, are uniquely eaten raw in the area as &quot;takenoko sashimi&quot;. &quot;Futomaki&quot; or &quot;futomakizushi&quot;, literally &quot;fat roll&quot;, is a large version of the sushi roll. The futomaki popularly made in Chiba Prefecture is up to 10 centimeters in diameter. Futomaki in Chiba Prefecture often utilize various ingredients to form a pattern, such as a flower or a kanji character, when the roll is cut and served.

Since 2009, the prefectural governor is Eiji Suzuki, better known under his stage name as Kensaku Morita, former actor, member of the House of Representatives (LDP/Independent – Tokyo 4th district) and member of the House of Councillors (Independent – Tokyo). He was reelected overwhelmingly to a second term as governor in the March 2013 election against only a Communist challenger and a minor, unaffiliated independent.

The assembly of Chiba Prefecture has a regular membership of 95, elected in 45 electoral districts, currently still in the unified local election cycle of 1947 (last round 2011). As of July 2014, it is composed as follows: LDP 52 members, DPJ 13, Kōmeitō 7, JCP 4, Shimin Net/SDP/Independents 4, Your Party 3, four other caucuses with 5 members in total.

In the National Diet, Chiba is represented by 13 members from single-member districts in the House of Representatives, and six members (three at-large per election) in the House of Councillors. After the most recent Diet elections of 2010, 2012 and 2013, the prefecture is represented by eleven Liberal Democrats and two Democrats in the House of Representatives, and three Liberal Democrats, two Democrats, and one Your Party member in the House of Councillors. Current Diet members from Chiba include former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda (H.R., DPJ – 4th district) and former ministers Kuniko Inoguchi (H.C., LDP – class of 2010) and Motoo Hayashi (H.R., LDP – 10th district).

===Local government===
As of 2014, Chiba is divided into 54 contiguous municipalities (see list above): 37 cities, 16 towns and one village, as in all of postwar Japan each with a directly elected mayor and assembly. The most populous and Chiba&#x27;s only designated major city is the capital Chiba City. Two cities, Funabashi and Kashiwa, are core cities. After late 20th century mergers, much of the rest of the prefecture is also organized in independent cities: Of the (today purely geographical) counties, only six remain, four of which have only one or two remaining towns or villages. After the reorganization of county and municipal governments in all prefectures in 1889/1890, there had initially been 12 counties and no city in Chiba; Chiba town in Chiba county became the first municipality in Chiba to be elevated to city status in 1921.

<doc id="179797" wikidata="Q617375" url="?curid=179797" title="Hiroshima Prefecture">
<text>is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūgoku region of Honshu. Hiroshima Prefecture has a population of 2,811,410 (1 June 2019) and has a geographic area of 8,479 km² (3,274 sq mi). Hiroshima Prefecture borders Okayama Prefecture to the east, Tottori Prefecture to the northeast, Shimane Prefecture to the north, and Yamaguchi Prefecture to the southwest.

Hiroshima is the capital and largest city of Hiroshima Prefecture, and the largest city in the Chūgoku region, with other major cities including Fukuyama, Kure, and Higashihiroshima. Hiroshima Prefecture is located on the Seto Inland Sea across from the island of Shikoku, and is bounded to the north by the Chūgoku Mountains. Hiroshima Prefecture is one of the three prefectures of Japan with more than one UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== History ==

The area around Hiroshima was formerly divided into Bingo Province and Aki Province. This location has been a center of trade and culture since the beginning of Japan&#x27;s recorded history. Hiroshima is a traditional center of the Chūgoku region and was the seat of the Mōri clan until the Battle of Sekigahara.

Together with Nara and Tokyo, Hiroshima is one of the three prefectures with more than one UNESCO World Heritage Site. The two such sites in Hiroshima Prefecture are:
* The Atomic Dome in Hiroshima, one of the few remnants of prewar Hiroshima following the atomic bombing in 1945;
* The Itsukushima Shrine in Miyajima, famed for filling with water and appearing to &quot;float&quot; during high tide.

== Geography ==


Hiroshima prefecture lies in the middle of Japan. Most of the prefecture consists of mountains leading towards Shimane Prefecture; and rivers produce rich plains near the coast.

The province faces Shikoku across the Seto Inland Sea. Hiroshima Bay opens on the Inland Sea. The prefecture also includes many small islands.

The sheltered nature of the Inland Sea makes Hiroshima&#x27;s climate very mild.

As of 1 April 2014, 4% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (the lowest percentage of any prefecture), namely Setonaikai National Park; Hiba-Dōgo-Taishaku and Nishi-Chūgoku Sanchi Quasi-National Parks; and six Prefectural Natural Parks.

<doc id="179801" wikidata="Q2094347" url="?curid=179801" title="Alistair Cooke">
<text>Alistair Cooke, KBE (né Alfred Cooke; 20 November 1908 – 30 March 2004) was a British-American writer whose work as a journalist, television personality and radio broadcaster was done primarily in the United States. Outside his journalistic output, which included &quot;Letter from America&quot; and &quot;&quot;, he was well known in the United States as the host of PBS &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; from 1971 to 1992. After holding the job for 22 years, and having worked in television for Cooke retired in 1992, although he continued to present &quot;Letter from America&quot; until shortly before his death. He was the father of author and folk singer John Byrne Cooke.

==Early life==
He was born Alfred Cooke in Salford, Lancashire, England, the son of Mary Elizabeth (Byrne) and Samuel Cooke. His father was a Methodist lay preacher and metalsmith by trade; his mother&#x27;s family were of Irish Protestant origin.

He was educated at Blackpool Grammar School, and won a scholarship to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he gained an honours degree (2:1) in English. He was heavily involved in the arts, was editor of &quot;Granta&quot;, and set up the Mummers, Cambridge&#x27;s first theatre group open to both sexes, from which he notably rejected a young James Mason, telling him to stick to architecture.

Cooke changed his name to Alistair when he was 22, in 1930.

==Career==

===Media beginnings===
Cooke&#x27;s first visit to the United States was in 1932 on a two-year Commonwealth Fund Fellowship (now Harkness Fellowship) to Yale and Harvard, where his acting and music skills came to the fore with visits to Hollywood.
Cooke saw a newspaper headline stating that Oliver Baldwin, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin&#x27;s son, had been sacked by the BBC as film critic. Cooke sent a telegram to the Director of Talks, asking if he would be considered for the post. He was invited for an interview and took a Cunard liner back to Britain, arriving twenty-four hours late for his interview. He suggested typing out a film review on the spot, and a few minutes later, he was offered the job.

Cooke replaced Oliver Baldwin as the BBC&#x27;s film critic on 8 October 1934 and gave his first BBC broadcast: &quot;&quot;I declare that I am a critic trying to interest a lot of people into seeing interesting films&quot;, he told his audience. &quot;I have no personal interest in any company. As a critic I am without politics and without class.&quot;&quot; He sat on a BBC Advisory Committee headed by George Bernard Shaw for correct pronunciation.

In 1935, Cooke also became London Correspondent for NBC. Each week, he recorded a 15-minute radio dialogue for American listeners on life in Britain, under the series title of &quot;London Letter&quot;. In 1936, he intensively reported on the Edward VIII abdication crisis for NBC. He made several talks on the topic each day to listeners in many parts of the United States. He calculated that in ten days he spoke 400,000 words on the subject. During the crisis, he was aided by a twenty-year-old Rhodes Scholar, Walt Rostow, who would become Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s national security advisor.

===Move to the United States===
Cooke stated that, on a visit to New York in 1936, he&#x27;d been impressed at how freely newspapers and journals were able to report on the abdication crisis whilst all comment was still censored in London. Very soon, in 1937, he immigrated. He became a United States citizen and swore the Oath of Allegiance on 1 December 1941, six days before Pearl Harbor was attacked. Shortly after immigrating, Cooke suggested to the BBC the idea of doing the &quot;London Letter&quot; in reverse: a 15-minute talk for British listeners on life in America. A prototype, &quot;Mainly About Manhattan&quot;, was broadcast intermittently from 1938, but the idea was shelved with the outbreak of World War II in 1939.

During this time, as well, Cooke undertook a journey through the whole United States, recording the lifestyle of ordinary Americans during the war and their reactions to it. The manuscript was published as &quot;The American Home Front: 1941–1942&quot; in the United States (and as &quot;Alistair Cooke&#x27;s American Journey: Life on the Home Front in the Second World War&quot; in the UK) in 2006.

The first &quot;American Letter&quot; was broadcast on 24 March 1946 (Cooke said this was at the request of Lindsey Wellington, the BBC&#x27;s New York Controller); the series was initially commissioned for only 13 instalments. The series came to an end 58 years later in March 2004, after 2,869 instalments and less than a month before Cooke&#x27;s death. Along the way, it picked up a new name (changing from &quot;American Letter&quot; to &quot;Letter from America&quot; in 1950) and an enormous audience, being broadcast not only in Britain and in many other Commonwealth countries, but throughout the world by the BBC World Service.

===Journalist===
In 1947, Cooke became a foreign correspondent for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; newspaper (later &quot;The Guardian&quot;), for which he wrote until 1972. It was the first time he had been employed as a staff reporter; all his previous work had been freelance. 

In reporting on the Montgomery bus boycott, begun by Rosa Parks and led by Martin Luther King, Cooke expressed sympathy for the economic costs imposed on the city bus company and referred to Mrs. Parks as &quot;the stubborn woman who started it all ... to become the Paul Revere of the boycott.&quot; Martin Luther King complained about Cooke&#x27;s &quot;biased and hostile reports&quot;, which motivated philosopher Michael Dummett to write his own refuting report, which &quot;The Guardian&quot; refused to publish.

In 1968, Cooke was only yards away from Robert F. Kennedy when he was assassinated, witnessing the events that followed.

===&quot;Omnibus&quot;===
In 1952, Cooke became the host of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Omnibus&quot;, the first U.S. commercial network television series devoted to the arts. It featured appearances by such personalities as Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy, Gene Kelly and Leonard Bernstein. Jonathan Winters was the first comic to appear on the show.

===Mid to later years===

In 1966 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;The Jet Age and the Habits of Man&quot;.

In 1971, he became the host of the new &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;, PBS&#x27;s showcase of quality British television. He remained its host for 22 years, before retiring from the role in 1992.

He achieved his greatest popularity in the United States in this role, becoming the subject of many parodies, including &quot;Alistair Cookie&quot; in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; (&quot;Alistair Cookie&quot; was also the name of a clay animated cookie-headed spoof character created by Will Vinton as the host of a video trailer for &quot;The Little Prince and Friends&quot;), and Alistair Quince, portrayed by Harvey Korman, who introduced many episodes in the early seasons of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;.

&quot;&quot; (1972), a 13-part television series about the United States and its history, was first broadcast in both the United Kingdom and the United States in 1973, and was followed by a book of the same title. It was a great success in both countries, and resulted in Cooke&#x27;s being invited to address the joint Houses of the United States Congress as part of Congress&#x27;s bicentenary celebrations. After the series was broadcast in Ireland, Cooke won a Jacob&#x27;s Award, one of the few occasions when this award was made to the maker of an imported programme.

===Final years===
On 2 March 2004, at the age of 95, following advice from his doctors, Cooke announced his retirement from &quot;Letter from America&quot;—after 58 years, the longest-running speech radio show in the world.

Cooke died at midnight on 30 March 2004, at his home in New York City. He had been ill with heart disease, but he died of lung cancer, which had spread to his bones. He was cremated, and his ashes were clandestinely scattered by his family in Central Park.

===Theft of bones ===
On 22 December 2005, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported that several of Cooke&#x27;s bones, and those of many other people, had been surgically removed before cremation by employees of Biomedical Tissue Services of Fort Lee, New Jersey, a tissue-recovery firm. The thieves sold the bones for use as medical-grade bone grafts. The cancer from which Cooke was suffering had spread to his bones, making them unsuitable for grafts. Reports indicated the people involved in selling the bones altered his death certificate to hide the cause of death and reduce his age from 95 to 85. Michael Mastromarino, a former New Jersey–based oral surgeon, and Lee Cruceta agreed to a deal that resulted in their imprisonment. Mastromarino was sentenced on 27 June 2008, in the New York Supreme Court, to 18 to 54 years&#x27; imprisonment. The entire story of the theft was featured in a documentary aimed at educating the public about modern-day grave robbery. On the morning of 7 July 2013, at age 49, Michael Mastromarino died at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital after suffering from liver cancer.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===
In 1932 Cooke became engaged to Henrietta Riddle, the daughter of the English actor Henry Ainley and the Baroness von Hütten, but she broke off the engagement the following year while he was in America on a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship. He met Ruth Emerson, a great-grandniece of Ralph Waldo Emerson, in 1933, and they married on 24 August 1934. Their son, John Byrne Cooke, was born 5 October 1940 in New York City, New York.

Alistair Cooke divorced Ruth in 1944, and married Jane White Hawkes, a portrait painter and the widow of neurologist A. Whitfield Hawkes, the son of Albert W. Hawkes, on 30 April 1946. Their daughter, Susan, was born on 22 March 1949.

===Recreation and interests===
Cooke took up golf in his mid-fifties, developing a fascination with the game, despite never attaining an extraordinary level of skill. He was driven by his love of golf to devote many of his &quot;Letter from America&quot; episodes to the topic, speaking once of the thrill of learning &quot;how much more awesome was the world of golf than the world of politics.&quot; Cooke became close friends with many of the leading golfers of the era: Jack Nicklaus, in the introduction to a compilation of Cooke&#x27;s writing on golf, recounts his many notable achievements, but describes him as &quot;most of all ... a friend.&quot;

==Honours and awards==
In 1973, Cooke was awarded an honorary knighthood (KBE) for his &quot;outstanding contribution to Anglo-American mutual understanding.&quot; Cooke was reportedly happy to accept, because in the words of Thomas Jefferson, it did not involve &quot;the very great vanity of a title.&quot; Having relinquished his British citizenship during World War II, he could not be called &quot;Sir Alistair&quot;.

After Alistair Cooke&#x27;s death the Fulbright Alistair Cooke Award in Journalism was established as a tribute to the man and his life and career achievements. The award supports students from the United Kingdom to undertake studies in the United States, and for Americans to study in the United Kingdom.

<text>The Guadalete (; ) is a river located almost entirely in the Spanish Province of Cádiz, rising in the Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park at an elevation of about , and running for into the Bay of Cádiz at El Puerto de Santa Maria, north of the city of Cádiz. The river&#x27;s name comes from the Arabic phrase &quot;وادي لكة&quot; (Wadi lakath) meaning &quot;River of Forgetfulness&quot;.

== Course ==
From its source in the Sierra de Grazalema, the Guadalete passes:
*Grazalema
*The Reservoir (Embalse) of Zahara
*Puerto Serrano
*Briefly enters Seville province and reenters Cádiz province
*Villamartín
*The Reservoir (Embalse) of Bornos
*The Reservoir (Embalse) of Arcos
*Arcos de la Frontera
*La Barca de la Florida
*Lomopardo and El Portal (near Jerez de la Frontera)

It then flows into the Bay of Cádiz in El Puerto de Santa María.

There are several dams with reservoirs along its course, including the Embalse de Zahara and the Embalse de Bornos. The &quot;Sierra Greenway&quot;, a bicycle path reclaimed from an abandoned railroad line, also passes along the river.

The largest tributaries of the Guadalete are the Guadalporcún, and the Majaceite, which joins it at Junta de los Ríos downstream from Arcos de la Frontera.

== History ==
The river may have been the location of the Battle of Guadalete in 711, at which the Visigothic army was defeated by an invading Muslim army, leading to the conquest of Iberia by the Umayyad Caliphate. The river was once the frontier between Christian and Moorish Iberia, receiving the sobriquet &quot;Río de los Muertos&quot; (river of the dead).

<doc id="179814" wikidata="Q205565" url="?curid=179814" title="Aurelius of Asturias">
<text>Aurelius () ( 740 – 774) was the King of Asturias from 768 to his death. Born in León, he was the son of Fruela of Cantabria (son of Peter of Cantabria); nephew of Alfonso I of Asturias; and a cousin of his predecessor, Fruela I. His brother, Bermudo I, later reigned as king from 789 to 791.

Aurelius was chosen as king by the Asturian nobility after Fruela I&#x27;s assassination. He is believed to have been crowned in Sama. His reign appears to have been relatively quiet and peaceful, attested to by the near-absence of mention of his reign in medieval chronicles. The only event of his reign narrated in the chronicles was a rebellion of serfs, which Aurelius put down. The location of the uprising is unknown, but it is the first recorded instance of anti-seignorial revolt in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. It is believed that, according to the custom of the times, he negotiated peace with the Muslims who dominated the lands to his south by an exchange of brides, which according to legend led to the place-name &quot;El Entrego&quot;, nowadays the heart of the municipality of San Martín del Rey Aurelio.

It would appear that his principal residence and the effective capital of Asturias during his reign was the municipality of San Martín del Rey Aurelio, then part of Langreo. Having reigned six years, Aurelius died there of natural causes in the year 774. The chronicles of the era make no mention of Aurelius having a wife or children. He was succeeded by his cousin-in-law, Silo, husband of Alfonso I&#x27;s daughter Adosinda.

Historians disagree about the location of Aurelius&#x27;s remains, as multiple medieval Asturian chronicles contradict one another. The Chronicle of Alfonso III claims that he was buried near his residence in the valley of Langreo, in the Church of San Martín de Tours, where there is a tomb engraved &quot;Rey Aurelio.&quot; The &quot;Estoria de España&quot; or &quot;Primera Crónica General&quot;, written in the 13th century during the reign of Alfonso X of Castile, says that Aurelius&#x27; remains were entombed in the municipality of Cangas de Onís. Additionally, historian Esteban de Garibay asserts that Aurelius was entombed next to his father Fruela of Cantabria, in the now-destroyed church of San Miguel in Yanguas, a municipality of the Province of Soria.

<text>Rex Edwin Lee (February 27, 1935 – March 11, 1996) was an American lawyer and academic who served as the 37th solicitor general of the United States from 1981 to 1985. He was responsible for bringing the solicitor general&#x27;s office to the center of U.S. legal policymaking. During his tenure, Lee argued 59 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.

A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Lee was an alumnus of Brigham Young University (BYU) and the University of Chicago Law School. Lee was the president of BYU from 1989 to 1995, and from 1971 to 1975 he was the inaugural dean of BYU&#x27;s J. Reuben Clark Law School (JRCLS).

==Background and education ==

Lee was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 27, 1935. His parents were Mabel (née Whiting) and Rex E. Lee. According to an obituary in &quot;American Rifleman&quot;, Lee&#x27;s father was shot and killed during a hunting trip in November 1934. His mother later married Wilford Shumway. Lee served a mission for the LDS Church in the Mexican Mission, serving as second counselor to the mission president. He first met his future wife, Janet Griffin (whose father was the Treasury Attaché of the US Embassy in Mexico City), while he was in Mexico. When Lee returned from his mission and enrolled at BYU, he became reacquainted with Janet, and they married on July 7, 1958, in Arizona. Lee and Griffin had seven children.

At BYU, Lee was elected student body president. After graduating in 1960, he attended the University of Chicago Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;University of Chicago Law Review&quot;. He graduated from Chicago in 1963 ranked first in his class.

==Early legal career and academia==
After law school, Lee served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court justice Byron White from 1963 to 1964. He then entered private practice at the law firm of Jennings, Strouss &amp; Salmon in Phoenix, Arizona. Only four years after graduating from law school, Lee argued his first case before the U.S. Supreme Court, despite the fact that he had not yet led any depositions in a lower civil court.

In 1972, Lee left private practice to become the founding dean of BYU&#x27;s JRCLS, and is considered personally responsible for recruiting many members of its charter class.

==Supreme Court advocate and scholar==
Lee entered public service, first at the invitation of Attorney General Edward H. Levi, as an Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Division in the United States Department of Justice from 1975 to 1976. In 1980, Lee wrote &quot;A Lawyer Looks at the Equal Rights Amendment&quot; in which he analyzed arguments against the Equal Rights Amendment.

He served as Solicitor General of the United States from 1981 to 1985 under President of the United States Ronald Reagan. As Solicitor General, Lee argued cases before the Supreme Court. During his time as Solicitor General, Lee won 23 of the 30 cases he argued during Reagan&#x27;s first presidential term. Before he died, he was preparing to argue his 60th case before the Supreme Court despite being confined to a hospital bed. Associate Justice White said that Lee &quot;was the epitome of integrity&quot;. At one point, while being criticized for taking unpopular stances that might have been at odds with the administration under which he served, Lee responded: &quot;I&#x27;m the solicitor general, not the pamphleteer general.&quot;

Lee relished the opportunity to argue before the Supreme Court. His son, Mike Lee, noted that Lee was very energetic and enthusiastic about arguing cases. In June 1985, Lee resigned as Solicitor General among criticism that he was not conservative enough. In 1986, Lee was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Lee managed to recover after about a year of cancer treatment and therapy and was named BYU&#x27;s tenth president. According to some accounts, when Lee was asked to assume the position as university president, he accepted on the condition that he would still be able to argue cases before the Supreme Court in his spare time. He argued nine before his death.

==BYU presidency==
As president of BYU, Lee oversaw the creation of clear standards on employment requirements and academic freedom, especially in terms of religious education. Lee believed that religious perspectives in the classroom promote academic freedom rather than hinder it. He also oversaw the streamlining of graduation requirements to aid students in graduating more quickly. Specifically, he limited major requirements to 60 credit hours, encouraging graduation within four years or eight semesters. Furthermore, he reinstated weekly university devotionals. His administration was responsible for growing the size of the campus and prestige of the university. In 1993, Lee decided BYU would offer lower tuition for summer semester to increase enrollment. While president, Lee instituted a rule that added regular church attendance as a requirement for attending BYU (though regular church attendance was not defined), stating that the rule would not be used to force church attendance but that those best fitted to BYU&#x27;s environment would, &quot;cheerfully participate in church activity&quot;.

In 1993 and 1994, controversy arose when two professors were terminated at BYU. Arguments arose with some claiming that they were fired due to their outspoken beliefs (one of which was supportive of the Pro-choice movement) that were not in line with the LDS Church, while administrators claimed it was strictly due to academic performance. These allegations sparked accusations of an &quot;anti-feminist&quot; BYU, which Lee denied, affirming that feminists were welcome on BYU campus. Lee also introduced &quot;question and answer&quot; sessions for faculty, students, and staff as well as additions to the physical plant of the university. Furthermore, he emphasized university devotional attendance and encouraged school spirit. In 1994, Lee created a committee to raise $250 million for the &quot;Lighting the Way Capital Campaign&quot; for the benefit of BYU and BYU-Hawaii to reach accreditation. The campaign was completed in December 1999, having earned over $400 million.

Before Lee&#x27;s tenure as BYU president was over, he struggled with lymphoma and peripheral neuropathy. He served as BYU&#x27;s president from July 1, 1989, to December 31, 1995. He died at age 61, less than three months after resigning as president of BYU. During Lee&#x27;s funeral, BYU classes were canceled for two hours to allow students to attend the funeral.

==Legacy==
During his career, Lee argued 59 cases before the Supreme Court. Future associate Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito served as an assistant to Solicitor General Lee from 1981 to 1985, where Alito argued 12 cases before the Court. According to scholar Rebecca Mae Salokar, Rex E. Lee brought the position of Solicitor General into the center of policymaking in the United States. In 1998, the JRCLS created the Rex E. Lee Chair to honor him.

Lee won one of the first Distinguished Utahn of the Year awards. Lee was an avid runner throughout his life (he was nominated to be Solicitor General two days after completing the Boston Marathon), and an annual race is held in his honor at BYU to raise proceeds for cancer research.

==Family==
Lee and his wife had seven children. His son Thomas Rex Lee was a justice of the Utah Supreme Court from 2010 to 2022. Another son, Mike Lee, has served as a United States Senator from Utah since 2011. Lee was a first cousin of politicians Mo Udall and Stewart Udall.

<text>Leg hair is hair that grows on the legs of humans, generally appearing after the onset of puberty. For aesthetic reasons and for some sports, people shave, wax, epilate, or use hair removal creams to remove the hair from their legs: see leg shaving.

The current Guinness World Record for world&#x27;s longest leg hair belongs to Jason Allen of Tucson, Arizona at 8.84 inches (22.46 cm).

==Growth==
The real action of leg hair takes place below the skin or the epidermis. The cells that are in the hair follicles divide and multiply. When the space fills up in the follicle it pushes older cells out and that is what becomes the leg hair. After the older cells become hard and leave the follicle, they form a hair shaft. The hair shaft is mostly made up of dead tissue and a protein that is known as keratin.

It is said that hair growth occurs during the &quot;growing&quot; phase of the follicle, and then retained as dead club hair during the &quot;resting&quot; phase. The old club hair might be lost within the following &quot;growing&quot; phase.

==Difference between men and women==
Men generally have more body hair than women, due to higher levels of androgens. Three different types of hair are present on the human body. Body hair, or androgenic hair, is the terminal hair that develops on the human body during and after puberty. It is differentiated from the head hair and less visible vellus hair, which is much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of androgens and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

==Protein involved in hair growth==
Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) is a secreted signaling protein. The expression of this protein is detected in hair follicles from the mice that scientists have experimented on. The hair follicles are localized to the outer root sheath during one of the phases of the hair growth cycle. Such experiments conclude that the protein FGF5 functions as an inhibitor when pertaining to hair elongation.

Seasonal changes are also known to affect hair growth. For instance, one experiment had concluded that the rate of hair growth for men and their beards was lowest in January and February and increased from March to July.

<text>A ski resort is a resort developed for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In Europe, most ski resorts are towns or villages in or adjacent to a ski area–a mountainous area with pistes (ski trails) and a ski lift system. In North America, it is more common for ski areas to exist well away from towns, so ski resorts usually are destination resorts, often purpose-built and self-contained, where skiing is the main activity.

==Ski resort==
Ski resorts are located in both hemispheres, on all continents except Antarctica. They typically are located on mountains, as they require a large slope. They also need to receive sufficient snow (at least in combination with artificial snowmaking, unless the resort uses dry ski slopes).

High concentrations of ski resorts are located in the Alps, Scandinavia, western and eastern North America, and Japan. There are also ski resorts in the Andes, scattered across central Asia, and in Australia and New Zealand.

Extreme locations of non-indoor (at least one ski lift outside) ski resorts include:
* The most northern ski resort near Tromsø, Norway
* The most southern ski resort near Ushuaia, Argentina
* The ski resort closest to the equator from the north, near Lijiang, China.
* The ski resort closest to the equator from the south, near Mahlasela, Lesotho.
==Types==

The ski industry has identified advancing generations of ski resorts:

;First generation: Developed around a well-established summer resort or village (e.g. Davos, St. Moritz, Kitzbühel, Chamonix, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Megève, ).
;Second generation: Created from a non-tourist village or pasture (e.g. St Anton am Arlberg, Lech, , , Aspen/Snowmass, Breckenridge Ski Resort).
;Third generation or integrated: Designed from scratch on virgin territory to be a purpose-built ski resort, all the amenities and services nearby (e.g. Sestriere, Flaine, La Plagne, Isola 2000).
;Fourth generation or village resorts: Created from a virgin territory or around an existing village, but more concerned with traditional uses (e.g. Valmeinier, , Shahdag Mountain Resort).

The term ski station is also used, particularly in Europe, for a skiing facility which is not located in or near a town or village. A ski resort which is also open for summer activities is often referred to as a mountain resort.

==Facilities and amenities==

Ski areas have marked paths for skiing known as runs, trails or pistes. Ski areas typically have one or more chairlifts for moving skiers rapidly to the top of hills, and to interconnect the various trails. Rope tows can also be used on short slopes (usually beginner hills or bunny slopes). Larger ski areas may use gondola lifts or aerial tramways for transportation across longer distances within the ski area. Resorts post their trail map illustrating the location of lifts, trails, services and the ski area boundary, and during the ski season issue a daily snow conditions report listing open trails, operating lifts and weather status.

Ski areas usually have at least a basic first aid facility, and some kind of ski patrol service to ensure that injured skiers are rescued. The ski patrol is usually responsible for rule enforcement, marking hazards, closing individual runs or areas as conditions require, and removing (dismissing) dangerous participants from the area.

The typical ski area base includes a ticket office, ski lodge, ski school, equipment rental/repair shop, restaurant/bar, shopping, shuttle bus stop and parking.
Some ski resorts offer lodging options on the slopes themselves, with ski-in and ski-out access allowing guests to ski right up to the door. Ski resorts often have other activities, such as snowmobiling, sledding, horse-drawn sleds, dog-sledding, ice skating, indoor or outdoor swimming and hot tubbing, game rooms, and local forms of entertainment, such as clubs, cinema, theaters and cabarets. 

Après-ski (French for &quot;after skiing&quot;) is a term for entertainment, nightlife or social events that occur specifically at ski resorts. These add to the enjoyment of resort-goers and provide something to do besides skiing and snowboarding. The culture originated in the Alps, where it is most popular and where skiers often stop at bars on their last run of the day while still wearing all their ski gear. Though the word &quot;ski&quot; is a derivation of the Old Norse via Norwegian, the choice of French is likely attributed to the early popularity of such activities in the French Alps, with which it was then linked.

== Environmental effects ==

As rising temperatures, receding glaciers and declining snowfall affect the environment, resort development and operations also have an environmental impact on land, lakes, streams, and wildlife. Amenities and infrastructure such as concrete buildings, ski lifts, access roads, parking lots, and railways have contributed to the urbanization of mountainous zones.

=== Primary (direct) impact of resort development ===
In recent years, the use of snow cannons by many ski resorts has increased to compensate for reduced levels of snowfall. In order to sustain good quality snow coverage, snowmaking requires large amounts of water and sometimes the creation of artificial lakes. Snow cannons also introduce a noise element.

=== Secondary (indirect) impact of resort development ===
The required infrastructure can affect erosion through the increased area of impervious surfaces, redirecting the flow of water runoff.

=== Mitigation efforts ===
Many resorts are taking steps to reduce their energy and water consumption and waste production, increase recycling, and restore habitats. Initiatives aimed at addressing environmental concerns include:
*Snowsports Industries America (SIA) ClimateUnited
*NSAA Sustainable Slopes Initiative
*National Forest Foundation Ski Conservation Fund
*Ceres Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP) Network
*FESI Winter Sports Sustainability Network (WSN)
*Protect Our Winters (POW)

<doc id="179823" wikidata="Q157289" url="?curid=179823" title="Areca">
<text>Areca is a genus of 51 species of palms in the family Arecaceae, found in humid tropical forests from the islands of the Philippines, Malaysia and India, across Southeast Asia to Melanesia. The generic name &quot;Areca&quot; is derived from a name used locally on the Malabar Coast of India.

==Usage==
The best-known member of the genus is &quot;A. catechu&quot;, the areca nut palm. Several species of areca nuts, known for their bitter and tangy taste, raw or dried, are routinely used for chewing, especially in combination with the leaves of betel and dried leaves of tobacco. Areca nut is also popularly referred to as betel nut because of its usage for chewing with betel leaves. In Assam, areca nut is also known as &quot;tamul&quot; in the local dialect.

== Cultural significance ==
The Areca palm, mainly known for its Areca nuts, holds profound cultural and historical significance in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. These regions, steeped in rich traditions, have integrated Areca into various aspects of life.

* Religious and Social Rituals: Areca nuts are traditionally used in religious rituals and social ceremonies. Hindu weddings, for instance, symbolize long-lasting marriage and are often exchanged during the practices. Similarly, in many Asian cultures, offering Areca nuts to guests is a sign of respect and hospitality.
* Symbolism: The Areca nut, often paired with betel leaves, symbolizes various cultural aspects. For example, in some parts of India, this combination represents love and is used in love potions.
* Art and Literature: Areca has been depicted in various forms of art and literature, symbolizing different themes ranging from fertility to prosperity.
* Traditional Medicine: In the Indian subcontinent, Areca nuts have been used in traditional medicine for their supposed health benefits, though modern research has raised concerns about their health impacts.
* Economic Aspect: Beyond its cultural relevance, Areca cultivation is essential to the rural economy in many parts of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, providing livelihoods to millions of farmers.
* Festivals and Celebrations: Certain festivals, especially in India and Southeast Asia, involve using Areca nuts. They are considered auspicious and are used in various traditional dishes and offerings.

<text>A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something. It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.

For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
Plans can be formal or informal:
* Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business. In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money.
* Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.

The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another. For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories.

It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use. More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space. This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.

==Topics==

===Planning===
The term planning implies the working out of sub-components in some degree of elaborate detail. Broader-brush enunciations of objectives may qualify as metaphorical roadmaps. Planning literally just means the creation of a plan; it can be as simple as making a list. It has not acquired a technical meaning, however, to cover the area of government legislation and regulations elated to the use of resources.

Planning can refer to the planned use of any and all resources, as in the succession of Five-Year Plans through which the government of the Soviet Union sought to develop the country. However, the term is most frequently used in relation to planning for the use of land and related resources, for example in urban planning, transportation planning, etc.

In a governmental context, &quot;planning&quot; without any qualification is most likely to mean the regulation of land use. See also zoning.

===Planners===
Planners are the professionals that have the requisite training to take or make decisions that will help or balance the society in order to have a functional, aesthetic, and convenient environment.

===Methodology===
Concepts such as top-down planning (as opposed to bottom-up planning) reveal similarities with the systems thinking behind the top-down model.

The subject touches such broad fields as psychology, game theory, communications and information theory, which inform the planning methods that people seek to use and refine; as well as logic and science (i.e. methodological naturalism) which serve as a means of testing different parts of a plan for reliability or consistency.

The specific methods used to create and refine plans depend on who is to make it, who is to put it to use, and what resources are available for the task. The methods used by an individual in his or her mind or personal organizer, may be very different from the collection of planning techniques found in a corporate board-room, and the planning done by a project manager has different priorities and uses different tools to the planning done by an engineer or industrial designer.

==Examples of plans==
* Architectural plan
* Business plan
* Fragplan
* Flight plan
* Health plan
* Marketing plan
* Military plan
* Project plan
* Site plan
* The Schlieffen Plan
* The Five-Year Plan system in the former Soviet Union
* The Marshall Plan

<doc id="179825" wikidata="Q110138" url="?curid=179825" title="Top Gun">
<text>Top Gun is a 1986 American action drama film directed by Tony Scott and produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, with distribution by Paramount Pictures. The screenplay was written by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., and was inspired by an article titled &quot;Top Guns&quot;, written by Ehud Yonay and published in &quot;California&quot; magazine three years earlier. It stars Tom Cruise as Lieutenant Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell, a young naval aviator aboard the aircraft carrier . He and his radar intercept officer, Lieutenant (junior grade) Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards), are given the chance to train at the United States Navy&#x27;s Fighter Weapons School (Top Gun) at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Tom Skerritt also appear in supporting roles.

When &quot;Top Gun&quot; was released on May 16, 1986, although its visual effects and soundtrack were universally acclaimed, the film received mixed reviews from film critics. Despite this, four weeks after its release, the number of theaters showing it increased by 45 percent, and it overcame initial critical resistance to become a huge commercial hit, grossing $357 million globally against a production budget of $15 million. &quot;Top Gun&quot; was the highest-grossing domestic film of 1986, as well as the highest-grossing film of 1986 worldwide.

The film maintained its popularity over the years and earned an IMAX 3D re-release in 2013, while the retrospective critical reception became more positive. Additionally, the soundtrack to the film has since become one of the most popular film soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification. The film won both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot; performed by Berlin.

In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. A sequel, &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, in which Cruise and Kilmer reprised their roles, was released 36 years later on May 27, 2022, and surpassed the original film both critically and commercially.

== Plot ==

U.S. Navy Naval Aviator Lieutenant Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell and his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) Lieutenant Junior Grade Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw, stationed in the Indian Ocean aboard , fly the F-14A Tomcat. During an interception with two hostile MiG-28s, Maverick missile-locks on one, while the other hostile locks onto Maverick&#x27;s wingman, Cougar. Maverick drives it off, but Cougar is so shaken that Maverick defies orders to land and shepherds him back to the carrier. As a result, Cougar resigns his commission, and loses his opportunity to attend Top Gun, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at Naval Air Station Miramar. Maverick and Goose are sent in his place by CAG &quot;Stinger&quot;, not without getting a reprimand for disobeying landing order.

Before the first day of instruction, Maverick unsuccessfully approaches a woman at a bar. He learns the next day she is an astrophysicist and civilian Top Gun instructor, Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Blackwood. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with a MiG-28. In Maverick&#x27;s first training hop, he flies below , breaking a major rule of engagement, to defeat instructor Lieutenant Commander Rick &quot;Jester&quot; Heatherly. Maverick and Goose also buzz the control tower when specifically told not to do so. They are reprimanded by chief instructor Commander Mike &quot;Viper&quot; Metcalf.

Privately, Jester tells Viper that while he admires Maverick&#x27;s skill, he is not sure if he would trust him in combat. In class, Charlie objects to Maverick&#x27;s aggressive tactics against the MiG-28, but privately tells him she admires his flying; they begin a romantic relationship.

On training Hop 19, Maverick abandons his wingman &quot;Hollywood&quot; to chase Viper. As a result, first Hollywood and then Maverick are defeated in a demonstration of the value of teamwork. Jester tells Maverick his flying is excellent, but criticizes him for leaving his wingman. Maverick&#x27;s rival, Lieutenant Tom &quot;Iceman&quot; Kazansky, calls his behavior &quot;foolish&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot;, and worse than the enemy, to which Maverick responds &quot;I am dangerous&quot;.

Maverick and Iceman, the leading contenders for the Top Gun Trophy, chase an A-4 in Hop 31. As Iceman has trouble getting a lock on the A-4, Maverick pressures him to break off so that he can move into firing position. However, Maverick&#x27;s F-14 flies through Iceman&#x27;s jet wash and suffers a flameout of both engines, going into an unrecoverable flat spin. Maverick and Goose eject, but Goose slams into the jettisoned aircraft canopy and is killed.

The board of inquiry clears Maverick of any wrongdoing, but he is shaken and guilt-ridden, and considers quitting. He seeks advice from Viper, who flew with Maverick&#x27;s father in the Vietnam War air battle where he was killed. Contrary to official reports faulting Mitchell, Viper says he died heroically. He tells Maverick he can succeed if he regains his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate and congratulates Iceman, who has won the Top Gun Trophy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick receive immediate deployment orders to deal with a crisis situation; they are sent to &quot;Enterprise&quot; to provide air support for the rescue of the SS &quot;Layton&quot;, a disabled communication ship that drifted into hostile waters.

Aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Iceman and Hollywood are assigned to provide air cover, with Maverick and RIO Merlin on standby. Iceman expresses his concerns to Stinger about Maverick&#x27;s mental state, but is told to just do his job. Iceman and Hollywood are pulled into a dogfight with what first appear to be two MiGs, but turn out to be six. After Hollywood is shot down, Maverick is scrambled alone due to catapult failure. He goes into a spin after encountering another jet wash, but recovers. Shaken, he breaks off temporarily, but then re-engages and shoots down three MiGs. Iceman destroys a fourth, and the remaining two MiGs withdraw. Upon their triumphant return to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the pilots share their newfound respect for one another. Finally confident and able to let go of the guilt caused by the training accident, Maverick later throws Goose&#x27;s dog tags overboard.

Offered the choice of any assignment, Maverick chooses to return to Top Gun as an instructor. He and Charlie reunite at a bar in Miramar.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The primary inspiration for the film was the article &quot;Top Guns&quot; by Ehud Yonay, from the May 1983 issue of &quot;California&quot; magazine, which featured aerial photography by then-Lieutenant Commander Charles &quot;Heater&quot; Heatley. The article detailed the life of fighter pilots at Naval Air Station Miramar in San Diego, self-nicknamed &quot;Fightertown USA&quot;. Numerous screenwriters allegedly turned down the project. Bruckheimer and Simpson went on to hire Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., to write the first draft. The research methods, by Epps, included attendance at several declassified Top Gun classes at Miramar and gaining experience by being flown in an F-14. The first draft failed to impress Bruckheimer and Simpson, and is considered to be very different from the final product in numerous ways. David Cronenberg and John Carpenter were approached to direct the film, but both declined. Tony Scott was hired to direct on the strength of a commercial he had done for Swedish automaker Saab in the early 1980s, where a Saab 900 turbo is shown racing a Saab 37 Viggen fighter jet.

Actor Matthew Modine turned down the role of Pete Mitchell because he felt the film&#x27;s pro-military stance went against his politics and he chose to do &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; instead. The producers wanted Tom Cruise for the role after seeing him in &quot;Risky Business&quot;. Cruise was offered the part while he was in London filming &quot;Legend&quot;; he was reluctant to take the part but Tony&#x27;s brother Ridley Scott convinced him to take it. For the role of Maverick, before Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, Patrick Swayze, Sean Penn, Rob Lowe, Charlie Sheen, Michael J. Fox and Ralph Macchio were considered, while Brooke Shields, Demi Moore and Julianne Phillips were the possible candidates for Charlie. Phillips had been scheduled to perform a screen test opposite Tom Cruise.

Val Kilmer was reluctant to play Kazansky as he found the script &quot;silly&quot; and disliked warmongering in films, but took the role as he was under contract with the studio.

The producers wanted the assistance of the U.S. Navy in the production of the film. The Navy was influential in relation to script approval, which resulted in changes being made. The opening dogfight was moved to international waters as opposed to Cuba, the language was toned down, and a scene that involved a crash on the deck of an aircraft carrier was also scrapped. Maverick&#x27;s love interest was also changed from a female enlisted member of the Navy to a civilian contractor with the Navy, due to the U.S. military&#x27;s prohibition of fraternization between officers and enlisted personnel. The &quot;Charlie&quot; character also replaced an aerobics instructor from an early draft as a love interest for Maverick after producers were introduced to Christine &quot;Legs&quot; Fox, a civilian mathematician employed by the Center for Naval Analyses as a specialist in Maritime Air Superiority (MAS), developing tactics for aircraft carrier defense.

=== Filming ===
Filming began in Oceanside, California, on June 26, 1985, with it later moving to Miramar to begin shooting scenes on the aircraft. The Navy made aircraft and crew from Carrier Air Wing Fifteen (CVW-15) available for the movie, which then consisted of F-14 squadrons VF-51 &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; (which Mike &quot;Viper&quot; Metcalf mentions in the scene at his home) and VF-111 &quot;Sundowners&quot; (which was referenced by Marcus &quot;Sundown&quot; Williams&#x27; callsign and helmet design). Paramount paid as much as US$7,800 per hour (equivalent to $ in 2023) for fuel and other operating costs whenever aircraft were flown outside their normal duties. After filming wrapped up, one of the aircraft used (BuNo 160694) was sent to the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; Museum in Corpus Christi, Texas, where it resides today. Aside from the aircraft of CVW-15, F-14s of other squadrons made background appearances. Aircraft of VF-114 &quot;Aardvarks&quot; and VF-213 &quot;Blacklions&quot; appear in shots of the carrier sequences filmed aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, while the fleet of VF-1 &quot;Wolfpack&quot; is visible in shots taken at Miramar. The majority of the carrier flight deck shots were of normal aircraft operations and the film crew had to take what they could get, save for the occasional flyby which the film crew would request. During filming, director Tony Scott wanted to film aircraft landing and taking off, back-lit by the sun. During one particular filming sequence, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer changed the ship&#x27;s course, thus changing the light. When Scott asked if they could continue on their previous course and speed, he was informed by the commander that it cost US$25,000 (equivalent to $ in 2023) to turn the ship, and to continue on course. Scott wrote the carrier&#x27;s captain a check so that the ship could be turned and he could continue shooting for another five minutes.

Future NASA astronaut Scott Altman was among the pilots of VF-51 who flew F-14 aircraft for many of the film&#x27;s stunt sequences, having been recently stationed at NAS Miramar at time of filming. Altman was the pilot seen &quot;flipping the bird&quot; in the film&#x27;s well-known opening sequence, as well as piloting the aircraft shown &quot;buzzing the tower&quot; throughout the film. The infamous &quot;buzzing the tower&quot; sequence raised concern among residents who called the base and local news media to report a &quot;berserk pilot&quot;.

Most of the sequences of the aircraft maneuvering over land were shot at Naval Air Station Fallon, in Nevada, using ground-mounted cameras. The majority of air-to-air filming was done using a Learjet. The F-14s also had cameras mounted both inside the cockpit and on six external camera mounts, which were built by Grumman for filming &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; and modified for use on &quot;Top Gun&quot;.

The fictitious MIG-28 enemy aircraft was depicted by the Northrop F-5.

The film was shot in the Super 35 format, as anamorphic lenses were too large to fit inside the cockpits of the fighter jets.

Reshoots after &quot;Top Gun&quot;″s filming wrapped conflicted with &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, in which McGillis starred with brown hair. &quot;Top Gun&quot; filmmakers were forced to hide her hair color, which for example resulted that the scene shot in an elevator featured McGillis in a baseball cap. While filming her scenes, McGillis had to be shoeless to match Cruise&#x27;s height.

Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl was hired to do in-flight camera work for the film. The original script called for a flat spin, which Scholl was to perform and capture on a camera on the aircraft. The aircraft was observed to spin through its recovery altitude, at which time Scholl radioed &quot;I have a problem... I have a real problem&quot;. He was unable to recover from the spin and crashed his Pitts Special biplane into the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast near Carlsbad on September 16, 1985. Neither Scholl&#x27;s body nor his aircraft were recovered, leaving the official cause of the accident unknown. &quot;Top Gun&quot; was dedicated to Scholl&#x27;s memory.

==== Locations ====
The San Diego restaurant and bar Kansas City Barbeque served as a filming location for two scenes shot in July 1985. The first scene features Goose and Maverick singing &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; while seated at the piano. The final scene, where &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27; can be heard on the restaurant&#x27;s Wurlitzer jukebox, was also filmed at the restaurant. Both scenes were filmed consecutively. After the release of the movie, the restaurant went on to collect a significant amount of memorabilia from the motion picture until a kitchen fire on June 26, 2008, destroyed much of the restaurant. Some memorabilia and props, including the original piano used in the film, survived the fire, and the restaurant re-opened in November 2008.

In 1985, Paramount Pictures rented the Graves House, now commonly called the &quot;Top Gun&quot; House, a historic San Diego Folk Victorian/Queen Anne cottage located at 102 North Pacific Street, and used it as the home for Charlotte &#x27;Charlie&#x27; Blackwood. Charlie&#x27;s backyard scenes were filmed at another house located at 112 First Street (Seagaze Drive) that was behind The Graves House. In May 2020, The Graves House was relocated and later renovated into a pie shop called High Pie located at 250 North Pacific Street.

== Music ==

The &quot;Top Gun&quot; soundtrack is one of the most popular soundtracks to date, reaching 9× Platinum certification and No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart for five non-consecutive weeks in the summer and fall of 1986. Harold Faltermeyer, who previously worked with both Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson on &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, was sent the script of &quot;Top Gun&quot; by Bruckheimer before filming began. Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock worked on numerous songs including the Oscar-winning &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;. Kenny Loggins performed two songs on the soundtrack, &quot;Playing with the Boys&quot;, and &quot;Danger Zone&quot;. Berlin recorded the song &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, which would later win numerous awards, sending the band to international acclaim. After the release of Loggins&#x27;s single &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, sales of the album exploded, selling 7 million in the United States alone. On the re-release of the soundtrack in 2000, two songs that had been omitted from the original album (and had been released many years before the film was made), &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; by Jerry Lee Lewis and &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;&quot; by The Righteous Brothers, were added. The soundtrack also includes &quot;&quot;Top Gun&quot; Anthem&quot; and &quot;Memories&quot; by Faltermeyer, with Steve Stevens also performing on the former.

Other artists were considered for the soundtrack project but did not participate. Bryan Adams was considered as a potential candidate but refused to participate because he felt the film glorified war. The band Toto was originally meant to record &quot;Danger Zone&quot;, and had also written and recorded a song &quot;Only You&quot; for the soundtrack. However, there was a dispute between Toto&#x27;s lawyers and the producers of the film, paving the way for Loggins to record &quot;Danger Zone&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot; being omitted from the film entirely.

In 2024, the specialized film music label La-La Land Records released a two-CD set of the soundtrack. The second disc contains the same tracks that have been made available on previous editions. But the first disc contains the complete instrumental score by Harold Faltermeyer which is officially available for the first time (only the &quot;Top Gun Anthem&quot; ended on the first edition of the soundtrack album with the &quot;Memories&quot; track added years later on the expanded and deluxe editions).

== Release ==
===Theatrical===
The film&#x27;s premiere was held in New York City on May 12, 1986, with another held in San Diego on May 15.

The film opened in the United States and Canada in 1,028 theaters on May 16, 1986, a week prior to the Memorial Day weekend, which was considered a gamble at the time.

=== Home media ===
In addition to its box office success, &quot;Top Gun&quot; went on to break further records in the then still-developing home video market. It was the first new-release blockbuster on VHS to be priced as low as $26.95 and, backed by a massive $8 million marketing campaign, including a &quot;Top Gun&quot;-themed Diet Pepsi commercial, the advance demand was such that the film became the best-selling VHS in the industry&#x27;s history on pre-orders alone, with over 1.9 million units ordered before its launch on March 11, 1987. It eventually sold a record 2.9 million units. In 1995, the film premiered on a THX certified LaserDisc with a Dolby Digital AC-3 track. A Widescreen VHS release was released on September 10, 1996.

The film was first released in the U.S. on DVD under Paramount Pictures on October 20, 1998, and included the film in both Widescreen (non-anamorphic Univisium 2.00:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions. &quot;Top Gun&quot;&#x27;s home video success was again reflected by strong DVD sales, which were furthered by a Special Collector&#x27;s Edition 2-disc DVD release on December 14, 2004, in both Widescreen (anamorphic 2.39:1) and Full Screen (open matte) versions, that include new bonus features. Special features comprise audio commentary by Bruckheimer, Tony Scott and naval experts, four music videos including the &quot;Top Gun Anthem&quot; and &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, a six-part documentary on the making of &quot;Top Gun&quot;, and vintage gallery with interviews, behind-the-scenes and survival training featurettes.

Subsequently, the film was first released on a Special Collector&#x27;s Edition Blu-ray disc on July 29, 2008, with the same supplemental features as the previous 2004 DVD. A 2-disc limited edition 3D copy was issued on February 19, 2013. The remastered 4K Ultra HD version of the film was released in Digital format on May 13, 2020, with the Blu-ray following on May 19, 2020. It included two new special features titled &quot;The Legacy of Top Gun&quot; and &quot;On Your Six: Thirty Years of Top Gun&quot;, with the remaining bonus features carrying over from previous versions.

&quot;Top Gun&quot; reached number one on the U.K. Official Film Chart based on DVD, Blu-ray, and download sales on the week ending on May 31, 2022.

=== IMAX 3D re-release ===
&quot;Top Gun&quot; was re-released in IMAX 3D on February 8, 2013, for six days. A four-minute preview of the conversion, featuring the &quot;Danger Zone&quot; flight sequence, was screened at the 2012 International Broadcasting Convention in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

===2021 re-release===
&quot;Top Gun&quot; was re-released in Dolby Cinema and screened by AMC Theatres on 153 screens on May 13, 2021. On the first weekend it grossed a total of $248,000 ranking at number 10. It grossed a total of $433,000 in a ten-day period.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film quickly became a success and was the highest-grossing film of 1986. It would be six months before its theater count dropped below that of its opening week. It was number one on its first weekend with a gross of $8.2 million, and went on to a total domestic gross of $176.8 million, and $177 million internationally, for a worldwide box office total of $353.8 million. The film sold an estimated 47.65 million tickets in North America in its initial theatrical run.

The film grossed an additional $3 million in its IMAX re-release in 2013, and an additional $471,982 in its 2021 re-release, bringing its domestic gross to $180.3 million and its worldwide gross to $357.3 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 58% based on reviews from 76 critics, with an average rating of 6.0/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aerial footage shot with an expert eye for action, &quot;Top Gun&quot; offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren&#x27;t in the air.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 50 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, saying that: Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising the action sequences but criticizing the romantic subplot, writing that &quot;it belongs in a teenage sex-fantasy film and not in a movie that deserves the genuine romantic value of &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot;&quot;. American film critic Pauline Kael commented: 

Some critics have said that the film promotes American jingoism. Filmmaker Oliver Stone told &quot;Playboy&quot; that the film &quot;sold the idea that war is clean, war can be won … nobody in the movie ever mentions that he just started World War Three!&quot; In 1990, Tom Cruise, while promoting Stone&#x27;s &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, said the film should be taken as a &quot;fairy tale&quot; instead of real depiction of wars and added that it would have been irresponsible to make a sequel because the film gave a misleading view of war. Cruise reprised his role in the sequel 36 years later, this time to mostly positive reviews. Val Kilmer, who was critical of warmongering in the first film, also returned for the sequel.

Journalist and former F-14 RIO Ward Carroll considered the movie iconic and culturally relevant, even jokingly referring to it as &quot;the greatest movie ever made&quot;. But while conceding the need for narrative and cinematographic liberties, he felt that the film had several &quot;cringe-worthy technical errors that cause it to be as much cartoon as tribute&quot;. Carroll identified 79 departures from naval aviation procedure, technical mistakes, and continuity errors in a 2019 article for Military.com. The YouTube creator LegalEagle posted a video called &quot;Military Laws Broken: Top Gun (with real JAG),&quot; in which the film is reviewed with a veteran Judge Advocate General lawyer, which discusses that the film takes considerable liberties concerning US Military and Naval regulations and laws that are violated. For instance, Maverick&#x27;s buzzing the air control towers would in real life have likely resulted in his flight status being immediately revoked, while other offenses committed would likely have had the pilot being punished with the death penalty if committed during a time of war.

=== Accolades===
* In 2008, the film was ranked at number 455 in &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest films of all time.
* Yahoo! Movies ranked &quot;Top Gun&quot; number 19 on their list of greatest action films of all time.

== Influence ==
Film producer John Davis said that &quot;Top Gun&quot; was a recruiting video for the Navy, and that people saw the movie and said, &quot;Wow! I want to be a pilot.&quot; The Navy had recruitment booths in some theaters to attract enthusiastic patrons. After the film&#x27;s release, a popular claim arose that the number of young men who joined the Navy wanting to be naval aviators went up by 500%; however, its accuracy has since been disputed, with modern analyses indicating a more modest total Navy enlistment increase of 8%. The film helped rehabilitate the military&#x27;s image following the Vietnam War.

The U.S. Department of Defense Office of Inspector General blamed sexist behavior depicted in &quot;Top Gun&quot; for making sexual assault more likely in the real-life military, contributing to the Tailhook scandal in 1991.

In December 2024, Tom Cruise was awarded the Distinguished Public Service Award, which is the highest civilian honor given to private citizens by the US Navy for his &quot;outstanding contributions&quot; to the military through his appearances in military-related film.

== In popular culture ==

The 1991 film &quot;Hot Shots!&quot; was a comedy spoof of &quot;Top Gun&quot;.

&quot;Top Gun&quot; is one of many war and action films, especially those by Bruckheimer, parodied in the 2004 comedy &quot;Team America: World Police&quot;.

&quot;Top Gun&quot;, along with &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, is recognized for being an inspiration for the TV series &quot;JAG&quot; and the subsequent &quot;NCIS&quot; franchise in turn. &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot; are also owned by Paramount.

The DisneyToon Studios film &quot;Planes&quot; (2013) pays homage to &quot;Top Gun&quot; with Kilmer and Edwards appearing in the film as part of the voice cast.

Two Chinese war films, &quot;&quot; (2011) and &quot;Sky Hunter&quot; (2017), were based on &quot;Top Gun&quot;. On January 23, 2011, China&#x27;s state broadcaster &quot;China Central Television&quot; published a TV news story about the alleged efficiency of Chinese fighter pilots which incorporated footage from the &quot;Top Gun&quot; action sequences. Chinese internet users noticed the plagiarism, whereupon the broadcast was immediately withdrawn. The CCTV has declined comments on this incident.

== Sequel ==
A sequel, &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, was released on May 27, 2022 to critical and commercial success. The sequel had been in active development since at least 2010. By September 2014, it was revealed that Justin Marks was in negotiations to write the screenplay, which was confirmed in June 2015. In May 2017, during the promotional tour for &quot;The Mummy&quot;, Cruise confirmed that a sequel to &quot;Top Gun&quot; would start filming in 2018. In June 2017, Cruise revealed that the sequel&#x27;s title would be &quot;Top Gun: Maverick&quot;, with Faltermeyer returning as composer for the film. Scott was originally intended to return to direct the sequel, but had died by suicide on August 19, 2012. Also in June 2017, it was announced that Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in 2013&#x27;s &quot;Oblivion&quot;, was set to direct—with &quot;Maverick&quot; dedicated to Scott&#x27;s memory—and Kilmer was announced to reprise his role as Iceman. McGillis was not asked to return for the sequel, but appears in the film via archive footage. The Bradshaw family—Edwards, Ryan and the Weis twins—also appear via archive footage, while Miles Teller plays their now-grown-up son, LT Bradley &quot;Rooster&quot; Bradshaw.

== Video games ==

&quot;Top Gun&quot; also spawned a number of video games for various platforms. The original game was released in 1986 under the same title as the film. It was released on Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled &quot;Top Gun&quot;, was released in 1987 for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Nintendo VS. System arcade cabinets. In the 1987 game, the player pilots an F-14 Tomcat fighter, and has to complete four missions. A sequel, &quot;Top Gun: The Second Mission&quot;, was released for the NES three years later.

Another game, &quot;Top Gun: Fire at Will&quot;, was released in 1996 for the PC and later for the Sony PlayStation platform. &quot;Top Gun: Hornet&#x27;s Nest&quot; was released in 1998. &quot;Top Gun: Combat Zones&quot; was released for PlayStation 2 in 2001 and was subsequently released for the GameCube and Microsoft Windows. &quot;Combat Zones&quot; features other aircraft besides the F-14. In 2006, another game simply titled &quot;Top Gun&quot; was released for the Nintendo DS. A 2010 game, also titled &quot;Top Gun&quot;, retells the film&#x27;s story. At E3 2011, a new game was announced, &quot;Top Gun: Hard Lock&quot;, which was released in March 2012 for Xbox 360, PC, and PlayStation 3.

<text>Lillestrøm is a municipality in Akershus county. It is located in the traditional district of Romerike. With a population of 85,757 inhabitants, it is the fourth most populated municipality in Viken. It was founded on 1 January 2020 as a merger between former municipalities Fet, Skedsmo and Sørum. The administrative centre of the municipality is the town of Lillestrøm. The town of Lillestrøm is a part of the Oslo metropolitan area.

== History ==

The name means &quot;the little [part of] Strøm&quot;, Strøm being the name of an old and large farm (Old Norse: &quot;straumr&quot;, which also meant &quot;stream&quot; as well).

Lillestrøm&#x27;s history dates back to the times river powered sawmills came into use for the production of building materials. Later Lillestrøm got its own steam sawmill which laid the base for the development of the area which became the town. The area was, by and large, a moss covered swamp-like area, at the time considered almost uninhabitable. However, the almost non-existent property values were judged to be a fair exchange and so the workers started living and settling in the area around the sawmill, and Lillestrøm was born.
On 1 January 1908 Lillestrøm became a municipality of its own, having been split from Skedsmo. At that time Lillestrøm municipality had a population of 4,351. On 1 January 1962 the two municipalities were reunited under the name Skedsmo. Before the merger Lillestrøm municipality had a population of 10,840.

In 1997, Skedsmo municipal council declared Lillestrøm to be a town (&quot;by&quot;) in its own right (a purely honorary status which has no effect upon the organization of local government, but is a matter of local pride nonetheless). The event is commemorated in an annual 4-day street fair, which includes music by high-profile Norwegian artists on several outdoor stages, food stalls, retail business exhibitions, and thrill rides. The whole thing (with free admission to all) is held in Lillestrøm&#x27;s main thoroughfare and its connecting streets, which are closed to all vehicles for the duration.

In 2002, Norway Trade Fairs moved from Skøyen to Lillestrøm.

==Transport==

===Road===
Norwegian national road 159 is a four-lane motorway connecting central Lillestrøm directly to Oslo. The European route E6 bypasses Lillestrøm a few kilometres to the west on its way from Oslo to the north of the country. National road 22, running from northwest to southeast, passes through the northern outskirts of the conurbation.

===Rail===
Lillestrøm is connected to Oslo by two separate railway lines. The Trunk Line (opened 1854) runs to Oslo via the Grorud valley and is used mostly by commuter trains calling at all stations, as well as freight trains. Non-stop commuter trains, airport express trains, and long-distance expresses use the high-speed Gardermoen Line (opened 1999), which runs mostly in tunnel to Oslo.

The Trunk Line north of Lillestrøm carries frequent local passenger trains as far as Dal as well as freight trains to Eidsvoll, Lillehammer, and Trondheim.

The Gardermoen Line (the stretch of which north of Lillestrøm opened in 1998) is used by airport express trains, regional trains to Eidsvoll and Lillehammer, and long-distance passenger services to Trondheim.

Running north-east from Lillestrøm, the Kongsvinger Line (opened 1862) conveys hourly local trains to Kongsvinger as well as a number of longer-distance trains, passenger and freight, to and from Sweden.

===Air===
Kjeller, a village north of the town of Lillestrøm, is the site of Kjeller Airfield, founded in 1912, which has the closest operational runway to Oslo city centre. However, this is overshadowed by the much larger international airport at Gardermoen (opened 1998), which is further north but just 12 minutes away from Lillestrøm railway station by high-speed rail.

The head office of Accident Investigation Board Norway is located in Lillestrøm, and is led by Grete Myhre.

The University College of Norwegian Correctional Service (Kriminalomsorgens høgskole og utdanningssenter, KRUS) is in Lillestrøm.

==Facilities==
Facilities in Lillestrøm include hotels, Norway trade fairs, a brand new cinema, a mall, Lillestrøm torv, restaurants, a high speed commuter train that reaches both Oslo and Gardermoen airport (the Gardermoen Line), a community cultural house (kulturhus), and a community outdoor swimming pool complex. At Kjeller, just outside the city, there is a military airport (1912) and several research institutes.

==Sport==
The local football club, Lillestrøm SK was founded in 1917 and currently plays in the Norwegian first division. The club is among the most successful in Norwegian football and has won five league titles in addition to six cups. During the 70s, the club went through the divisions with back-to-back promotions before eventually winning the double in 1977, largely thanks to their legendary player Tom Lund. Their home ground is Åråsen Stadion which accommodates 10,540 spectators.

<text>This is a list of the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], a kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula during the Early Middle Ages. It originated as a refuge for Visigothic nobles following the conquest of Iberia by the Umayyad Caliphate. Following the forced abdication of Alfonso III by his sons in 910, the kingdom was split into three: Asturias, León, and Galicia. All three were reunited in 924 under the Kingdom of León.

For later kings, see the list of Leonese monarchs and the list of Galician monarchs. From 1388, the title Prince of Asturias has been used for the heirs to the Castillian and Spanish thrones.

<doc id="179828" wikidata="Q152468" url="?curid=179828" title="Schlieffen Plan">
<text>The Schlieffen Plan (, ) is a name given after the First World War to German war plans, due to the influence of Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen and his thinking on an invasion of France and Belgium, which began on 4 August 1914. Schlieffen was Chief of the General Staff of the German Army from 1891 to 1906. In 1905 and 1906, Schlieffen devised an army deployment plan for a decisive (war-winning) offensive against the French Third Republic. German forces were to invade France through the Netherlands and Belgium rather than across the common border.

After losing the First World War, German official historians of the and other writers described the plan as a blueprint for victory. (Colonel-General) Helmuth von Moltke the Younger succeeded Schlieffen as Chief of the German General Staff in 1906 and was dismissed after the First Battle of the Marne (5–12 September 1914). German historians claimed that Moltke had ruined the plan by tampering with it, out of timidity. They managed to establish a commonly accepted narrative that Moltke the Younger failed to follow the blueprint devised by Schlieffen, condemning the belligerents to four years of attrition warfare.

In 1956, Gerhard Ritter published (&quot;The Schlieffen Plan: Critique of a Myth&quot;), which began a period of revision, when the details of the supposed Schlieffen Plan were subjected to scrutiny. Treating the plan as a blueprint was rejected because this was contrary to the tradition of Prussian war planning established by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, in which military operations were considered to be inherently unpredictable. Mobilisation and deployment plans were essential but campaign plans were pointless; rather than attempting to dictate to subordinate commanders, the commander gave the intent of the operation and subordinates achieved it through (mission tactics).

In writings from the 1970s, Martin van Creveld, John Keegan, Hew Strachan and others, studied the practical aspects of an invasion of France through Belgium and Luxembourg. They judged that the physical constraints of German, Belgian and French railways and the Belgian and northern French road networks made it impossible to move enough troops far enough and fast enough for them to fight a decisive battle if the French retreated from the frontier. Most of the pre-1914 planning of the German General Staff was secret and the documents were destroyed when deployment plans were superseded each April. The bombing of Potsdam in April 1945 destroyed much of the Prussian army archive and only incomplete records and other documents survived. Some records turned up after the fall of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), making an outline of German war planning possible for the first time, proving wrong much post-1918 writing.

In the 2000s, a document, &quot;RH61/v.96&quot;, was discovered in the trove inherited from the GDR, which had been used in a 1930s study of pre-war German General Staff war planning. Inferences that Schlieffen&#x27;s war planning was solely offensive were found to have been made by extrapolating his writings and speeches on tactics into grand strategy. From a 1999 article in &quot;War in History&quot; and in &quot;Inventing the Schlieffen Plan&quot; (2002) to &quot;The Real German War Plan, 1906–1914&quot; (2011), Terence Zuber engaged in a debate with Terence Holmes, Annika Mombauer, Robert Foley, Gerhard Gross, Holger Herwig and others. Zuber proposed that the Schlieffen Plan was a myth concocted in the 1920s by writers, intent on exculpating themselves and proving that German war planning did not cause the First World War. Later scholarship did not uphold the Zuber thesis except as a catalyst for research which revealed that Schlieffen had been far less dogmatic than had been presumed.
==Background==

===&quot;Kabinettskrieg&quot;===

After the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars in 1815, European aggression had turned outwards and the fewer wars fought within the continent had been , local conflicts decided by professional armies loyal to dynastic rulers. Military strategists had adapted by creating plans to suit the characteristics of the post-Napoleonic scene. In the late nineteenth century, military thinking remained dominated by the German Wars of Unification (1864–1871), which had been short and decided by great battles of annihilation. In &quot;Vom Kriege&quot; (On War, 1832) Carl von Clausewitz (1780–1831) had defined decisive battle as a victory which had political results

, (&quot;prostration&quot; strategy, later termed (destruction strategy) a policy of seeking decisive victory) replaced the slow, cautious approach to war that had been overturned by Napoleon. German strategists judged the defeat of the Austrians in the Austro-Prussian War (14 June – 23 August 1866) and the French imperial armies in 1870, as evidence that a strategy of decisive victory could still succeed.

===Franco-Prussian War===
Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder (1800–1891), led the armies of the North German Confederation that achieved a speedy and decisive victory against the armies of the Second French Empire (1852–1870) of Napoleon III (1808–1873). On 4 September, after the Battle of Sedan (1 September 1870), there had been a republican coup d&#x27;état and the installation of a Government of National Defence (4 September 1870 – 13 February 1871), that declared (war to the uttermost). From the French Army confronted Moltke the Elder with new, improvised armies. The French destroyed bridges, railways, telegraphs and other infrastructure; food, livestock and other material was evacuated to prevent it falling into German hands. A was promulgated on 2 November and by February 1871, the republican army had increased to Despite inexperience, lack of training and a shortage of officers and artillery, the size of the new armies forced Moltke to divert large forces to confront them, while still besieging Paris, isolating French garrisons in the rear and guarding lines of communication from (irregular military forces).


The Germans had defeated the forces of the Second Empire by superior numbers and then found the tables turned; only their superior training and organisation had enabled them to capture Paris and dictate peace terms. Attacks by forced the diversion of to guard railways and bridges, which put great strain on Prussian manpower. Moltke wrote later,

He had already written, in 1867, that French patriotism would lead them to make a supreme effort and use all their national resources. The quick victories of 1870 led Moltke to hope that he had been mistaken but by December, he planned an against the French population by taking the war into the south, once the size of the Prussian Army had been increased by another of reservists. Moltke intended to destroy or capture the remaining resources which the French possessed, against the protests of the German civilian authorities, who after the fall of Paris, negotiated a quick end to the war.
Colmar von der Goltz (1843–1916) and other military thinkers, like Fritz Hoenig in (The People&#x27;s War in the Loire Valley in Autumn 1870, 1893–1899) and Georg von Widdern in (Petty Warfare and the Supply Service, 1892–1907), called the short-war belief of mainstream writers like Friedrich von Bernhardi and Hugo von Freytag-Loringhoven an illusion. They saw the longer war against the improvised armies of the French republic, the &quot;indecisive&quot; battles of the winter of 1870–1871 and the against on the lines of communication, as better examples of the nature of modern war. Hoenig and Widdern conflated the old sense of as a partisan war, with a newer sense of &quot;a war between industrialised states, fought by nations-in-arms&quot; and tended to explain French success by reference to German failings, implying that fundamental reforms were unnecessary.

In (Leon Gambetta and the Army of the Loire, 1874) and (Leon Gambetta and his Armies, 1877), Goltz wrote that Germany must adopt ideas used by Léon Gambetta, by improving the training of Reserve and officers, to increase the effectiveness of the (supply service troops). Goltz advocated the conscription of every able-bodied man and a reduction of the period of service to two years (a proposal that got him sacked from the Great General Staff but was then introduced in 1893) in a nation-in-arms. The mass army would be able to compete with armies raised on the model of the improvised French armies and be controlled from above, to avoid the emergence of a radical and democratic people&#x27;s army. Goltz maintained the theme in other publications up to 1914, notably in (The People in Arms, 1883) and used his position as a corps commander from 1902 to 1907 to implement his ideas, particularly in improving the training of Reserve officers and creating a unified youth organisation, the (Young Germany League) to prepare teenagers for military service.

===&quot;Ermattungsstrategie&quot;===
The (strategy debate) was a public and sometimes acrimonious argument after Hans Delbrück (1848–1929), challenged the orthodox army view and its critics. Delbrück was editor of the (Prussian Annals), author of (The History of the Art of War within the Framework of Political History; four volumes 1900–1920) and professor of modern history at the Humboldt University of Berlin from 1895. General Staff historians and commentators like Friedrich von Bernhardi, Rudolph von Caemmerer, Max Jähns and Reinhold Koser, believed that Delbrück was challenging the strategic wisdom of the army. Delbrück had introduced (source criticism) developed by Leopold von Ranke, into the study of military history and attempted a reinterpretation of (On War). Delbrück wrote that Clausewitz had intended to divide strategy into (strategy of destruction) or (strategy of exhaustion) but had died in 1830 before he could revise the book.

Delbrück wrote that Frederick the Great had used during the Seven Years&#x27; War because eighteenth century armies were small and made up of professionals and pressed men. The professionals were hard to replace and the conscripts would run away if the army tried to live off the land, operate in close country or pursue a defeated enemy, in the manner of the later armies of the Coalition Wars. Dynastic armies were tied to magazines for supply, which made them incapable of fulfilling a strategy of annihilation. Delbrück analysed the European alliance system that had developed since the 1890s, the Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War and concluded that the rival forces were too well-balanced for a quick war. The growth in the size of armies made a swift victory unlikely and British intervention would add a naval blockade to the rigours of an indecisive land war. Germany would face a war of attrition, similar to the view Delbrück had formed of the Seven Years&#x27; War. By the 1890s, the had entered public discourse, when soldiers like the two Moltkes, also doubted the possibility of a quick victory in a European war. The German army was forced to examine its assumptions about war because of this dissenting view and some writers moved closer to Delbrück&#x27;s position. The debate provided the Imperial German Army with a fairly familiar alternative to , after the opening campaigns of 1914.

===Moltke the Elder===
====Deployment plans, 1871–1872 to 1890–1891====

Assuming French hostility and a desire to recover Alsace–Lorraine, Moltke the Elder drew up a deployment plan for 1871–1872, expecting that another rapid victory could be achieved but the French introduced conscription in 1872. By 1873, Moltke thought that the French army was too powerful to be defeated quickly and in 1875, Moltke considered a preventive war but did not expect an easy victory. The course of the second period of the Franco-Prussian War and the example of the Wars of Unification had prompted Austria-Hungary to begin conscription in 1868 and Russia in 1874. Moltke assumed that in another war, Germany would have to fight a coalition of France and Austria or France and Russia. Even if one opponent was quickly defeated, the victory could not be exploited before the Germans would have to redeploy their armies against the second enemy. By 1877, Moltke was writing war plans with provision for an incomplete victory, in which diplomats negotiated a peace, even if it meant a return to the and in 1879, the deployment plan reflected pessimism over the possibility of a Franco-Russian alliance and progress made by the French fortification programme.

Despite international developments and his doubts about , Moltke retained the traditional commitment to (war of manoeuvre) and an army trained to fight ever-bigger battles. A decisive victory might no longer be possible but success would make a diplomatic settlement easier. Growth in the size and power of rival European armies increased the pessimism with which Moltke contemplated another war and on 14 May 1890 he gave a speech to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, saying that the age of had returned. According to Ritter (1969) the contingency plans from 1872 to 1890 were his attempts to resolve the problems caused by international developments, by adopting a strategy of the defensive, after an opening tactical offensive, to weaken the opponent, a change from to . Foerster (1987) wrote that Moltke wanted to deter war altogether and that his calls for a preventive war diminished, peace would be preserved by the maintenance of a powerful German army instead. In 2005, Foley wrote that Foerster had exaggerated and that Moltke still believed that success in war was possible, even if incomplete and that it would make peace easier to negotiate. The possibility that a defeated enemy would &quot;not&quot; negotiate, was something that Moltke did not address.

===Schlieffen===
In February 1891, Schlieffen was appointed to the post of Chief of the (Great General Staff), the professional head of the ( [German Army]). The post had lost influence to rival institutions in the German state because of the machinations of Alfred von Waldersee (1832–1904), who had held the post from 1888 to 1891 and had tried to use his position as a political stepping stone. Schlieffen was seen as a safe choice, being junior, anonymous outside the General Staff and with few interests outside the army. Other governing institutions gained power at the expense of the General Staff and Schlieffen had no following in the army or state. The fragmented and antagonistic character of German state institutions made the development of a grand strategy most difficult, because no institutional body co-ordinated foreign, domestic and war policies. The General Staff planned in a political vacuum and Schlieffen&#x27;s weak position was exacerbated by his narrow military view.

In the army, organisation and theory had no obvious link with war planning and institutional responsibilities overlapped. The General Staff devised deployment plans and its chief became Commander-in-Chief in war but in peace, command was vested in the commanders of the twenty army corps districts. The corps district commanders were independent of the General Staff Chief and trained soldiers according to their own devices. The federal system of government in the German empire included ministries of war in the constituent states, which controlled the forming and equipping of units, command and promotions. The system was inherently competitive and became more so after the Waldersee period, with the likelihood of another , a war of the nation in arms, rather than the few European wars fought by small professional armies after 1815. Schlieffen concentrated on matters he could influence and pressed for increases in the size of the army and the adoption of new weapons. A big army would create more choices about how to fight a war and better weapons would make the army more formidable. Mobile heavy artillery could offset numerical inferiority against a Franco–Russian coalition and smash quickly, numerous fortified places. Schlieffen tried to make the army more operationally capable, to be superior to its potential enemies and achieve a decisive victory.

Schlieffen continued the practice of staff rides () tours of territory where military operations might take place and war games, to teach techniques to command a mass conscript army. The new national armies were so huge that battles would be spread over a much greater space than in the past and Schlieffen expected that army corps would fight (battle segments) equivalent to the tactical engagements of smaller dynastic armies. could occur anywhere, as corps and armies closed with the opposing army and became a (complete battle), in which the significance of the battle segments would be determined by the plan of the commander in chief, who would give operational orders to the corps,

in the former manner to battalions and regiments. &quot;War against France&quot; (1905), the memorandum later known as the &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot;, was a strategy for a war of extraordinarily big battles, in which corps commanders would be independent in &quot;how&quot; they fought, provided that it was according to the &quot;intent&quot; of the commander in chief. The commander led the complete battle, like commanders in the Napoleonic Wars. The war plans of the commander in chief were intended to organise haphazard encounter battles to make &quot;the sum of these battles was more than the sum of the parts&quot;.

====Deployment plans, 1892–1893 to 1905–1906====
In his war contingency plans from Schlieffen faced the difficulty that the French could not be forced to fight a decisive battle quickly enough for German forces to be transferred to the east against the Imperial Russian Army to fight a war on two fronts, one-front-at-a-time. Driving out the French from their frontier fortifications would be a slow and costly process that Schlieffen preferred to avoid by a flanking movement through the Low Countries. In 1893, this was judged impractical because of a lack of manpower and mobile heavy artillery. In 1899, Schlieffen added the manoeuvre to German war plans, as a possibility, if the French pursued a defensive strategy. The German army was more powerful and by 1905, after the Russian defeat in Manchuria, Schlieffen judged the army to be formidable enough to make the northern flanking manoeuvre the basis of a war plan against France alone.

In 1905, Schlieffen wrote that the Russo-Japanese War had shown that the power of Russian army had been overestimated and that it would not recover quickly from the defeat. Schlieffen could contemplate leaving only a small force in the east and in 1905, wrote &quot;War against France&quot; which was taken up by his successor, Moltke the Younger and became the concept of the main German war plan from Most of the German army would assemble in the west and the main force would be on the right (northern) wing. An offensive in the north through Belgium and the Netherlands would lead to an invasion of France and a decisive victory. Even with the windfall of the Russian defeat in the Far East in 1905 and belief in the superiority of German military thinking, Schlieffen had reservations about the strategy. Research published by Gerhard Ritter (1956, English edition in 1958) showed that the memorandum went through six drafts. Schlieffen considered other possibilities in 1905, using war games to model a Russian invasion of eastern Germany against a smaller German army.

In a staff ride during the summer, Schlieffen tested a hypothetical invasion of France by most of the German army and three possible French responses; the French were defeated in each but then Schlieffen proposed a French counter-envelopment of the German right wing by a new army. At the end of the year, Schlieffen played a war game of a two-front war, in which the German army was evenly divided and defended against invasions by the French and Russians, where victory first occurred in the east. Schlieffen was open-minded about a defensive strategy and the political advantages of the Entente being the aggressor, not just the &quot;military technician&quot; portrayed by Ritter. The variety of the 1905 war games show that Schlieffen took account of circumstances; if the French attacked Metz and Strasbourg, the decisive battle would be fought in Lorraine. Ritter wrote that invasion was a means to an end not an end in itself, as did Terence Zuber in 1999 and the early 2000s. In the strategic circumstances of 1905, with the Russian army and the Tsarist state in turmoil after the defeat in Manchuria, the French would not risk open warfare; the Germans would have to force them out of the border fortress zone. The studies in 1905 demonstrated that this was best achieved by a big flanking manoeuvre through the Netherlands and Belgium.

Schlieffen&#x27;s thinking was adopted as (Deployment [Plan] I) in 1905 (later called ) of a Franco-German war, in which Russia was assumed to be neutral and Italy and Austria-Hungary were German allies. &quot;[Schlieffen] did not think that the French would necessarily adopt a defensive strategy&quot; in such a war, even though their troops would be outnumbered but this was their best option and the assumption became the theme of his analysis. In , Germany would have to attack to win such a war, which entailed all of the German army being deployed on the German–Belgian border to invade France through the southern Dutch province of Limburg, Belgium and Luxembourg. The deployment plan assumed that Royal Italian Army and Austro-Hungarian Army troops would defend Alsace-Lorraine ().

==Prelude==

===Moltke the Younger===

Helmuth von Moltke the Younger took over from Schlieffen as Chief of the German General Staff on 1 January 1906, beset with doubts about the possibility of a German victory in a great European war. French knowledge about German intentions might prompt them to retreat to evade an envelopment that could lead to , a war of exhaustion and leave Germany exhausted, even if it did eventually win. A report on hypothetical French ripostes against an invasion, concluded that since the French army was six times larger than in 1870, the survivors from a defeat on the frontier could make counter-outflanking moves from Paris and Lyon against a pursuit by the German armies. Despite his doubts, Moltke retained the concept of a big enveloping manoeuvre, because of changes in the international balance of power. The Japanese victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) weakened the Russian army and the Tsarist state and made an offensive strategy against France more realistic for a time.

By 1910, Russian rearmament, army reforms and reorganisation, including the creation of a strategic reserve, made the army more formidable than before 1905. Railway building in Congress Poland reduced the time needed for mobilisation and a &quot;war preparation period&quot; was introduced by the Russians, to provide for mobilisation to begin with a secret order, reducing mobilisation time further. The Russian reforms cut mobilisation time by half compared with 1906 and French loans were spent on railway building; German military intelligence thought that a programme due to begin in 1912 would lead to of new track by 1922. Modern, mobile artillery, a purge of older, inefficient officers and a revision of the army regulations, had improved the tactical capability of the Russian army and railway building would make it more strategically flexible, by keeping back troops from border districts, to make the army less vulnerable to a surprise-attack, moving men faster and with reinforcements available from the strategic reserve. The new possibilities enabled the Russians to increase the number of deployment plans, further adding to the difficulty of Germany achieving a swift victory in an eastern campaign. The likelihood of a long and indecisive war against Russia, made a quick success against France more important, so as to have the troops available for an eastern deployment.

Moltke the Younger made substantial changes to the offensive concept sketched by Schlieffen in the memorandum &quot;War against France&quot; of 1905–06. The 6th and 7th Armies with VIII Corps were to assemble along the common border, to defend against a French invasion of Alsace-Lorraine. Moltke also altered the course of an advance by the armies on the right (northern) wing, to avoid the Netherlands, retaining the country as a useful route for imports and exports and denying it to the British as a base of operations. Advancing only through Belgium, meant that the German armies would lose the railway lines around Maastricht and have to squeeze the of the 1st and 2nd Armies through a gap wide, which made it vital that the Belgian railways were captured quickly and intact. In 1908, the General Staff devised a plan to take the Fortified Position of Liège and its railway junction by coup de main on the 11th day of mobilisation. Later changes reduced the time allowed to the fifth day, which meant that the attacking forces would need to get moving only hours after the mobilisation order had been given.

===Deployment plans, 1906–1907 to 1914–1915===
Extant records of Moltke&#x27;s thinking up to 1911–1912 are fragmentary and almost wholly lacking to the outbreak of war. In a 1906 staff ride Moltke sent an army through Belgium but concluded that the French would attack through Lorraine, where the decisive battle would be fought before an enveloping move from the north took effect. The right wing armies would counter-attack through Metz, to exploit the opportunity created by the French advancing beyond their frontier fortifications. In 1908, Moltke expected the British to join the French but that neither would violate Belgian neutrality, leading the French to attack towards the Ardennes. Moltke continued to plan to envelop the French near Verdun and the Meuse, rather than an advance towards Paris. In 1909, a new 7th Army with eight divisions was prepared to defend upper Alsace and to co-operate with the 6th Army in Lorraine. A transfer of the 7th Army to the right flank was studied but the prospect of a decisive battle in Lorraine became more attractive. In 1912, Moltke planned for a contingency where the French attacked from Metz to the Vosges Mountains and the Germans defended on the left (southern) wing, until all troops not needed on the right (northern) flank could move south-west through Metz against the French flank. German offensive thinking had evolved into a possible attack from the north, one through the centre or an envelopment by both wings.

====&quot;Aufmarsch I West&quot;====
 anticipated an isolated Franco-German war, in which Germany might be assisted by an Italian attack on the Franco-Italian border and by Italian and Austro-Hungarian forces in Germany. It was assumed that France would be on the defensive because their troops would be (greatly) outnumbered. To win the war, Germany and its allies would have to attack France. After the deployment of the entire German army in the west, they would attack through Belgium and Luxembourg, with virtually all the German force. The Germans would rely on an Austro-Hungarian and Italian contingents, formed around a cadre of German troops, to hold the fortresses along the Franco-German border. became less feasible, as the military power of the Franco-Russian alliance increased and Britain aligned with France, making Italy unwilling to support Germany. was dropped when it became clear that an isolated Franco-German war was impossible and that German allies would not intervene.

====&quot;Aufmarsch II West&quot;====
 anticipated a war between the Franco-Russian Entente and Germany, with Austria-Hungary supporting Germany and Britain perhaps joining the Entente. Italy was only expected to join Germany if Britain remained neutral. of the German army would operate in the west and in the east. France and Russia were expected to attack simultaneously, because they had the larger force. Germany would execute an &quot;active defence&quot;, in at least the first operation/campaign of the war. German forces would mass against the French invasion force and defeat it in a counter-offensive, while conducting a conventional defence against the Russians. Rather than pursue the retreating French armies over the border, of the German force in the west ( of the German army) would be transferred to the east, for a counter-offensive against the Russian army. became the main German deployment plan, as the French and Russians expanded their armies and the German strategic situation deteriorated, Germany and Austria-Hungary being unable to increase their military spending to match their rivals.

====&quot;Aufmarsch I Ost&quot;====
 was for a war between the Franco-Russian Entente and Germany, with Austria-Hungary supporting Germany and the British Empire perhaps joining the Entente. The Kingdom of Italy was only expected to join Germany if Britain remained neutral; of the German army would deploy in the west and in the east. France and Russia would attack simultaneously, because they had the larger force and Germany would execute an &quot;active defence&quot;, in at least the first operation/campaign of the war. German forces would mass against the Russian invasion force and defeat it in a counter-offensive, while conducting a conventional defence against the French. Rather than pursue the Russians over the border, of the German force in the east (about of the German army) would be transferred to the west, for a counter-offensive against the French. became a secondary deployment plan, as it was feared a French invasion force could be too well established to be driven from Germany or at least inflict greater losses on the Germans, if not defeated sooner. The counter-offensive against France was also seen as the more important operation, since the French were less able to replace losses than Russia and it would result in a greater number of prisoners being taken.

====&quot;Aufmarsch II Ost&quot;====
 was for the contingency of an isolated Russo-German war, in which Austria-Hungary might support Germany. The plan assumed that France would be neutral at first and possibly attack Germany later. If France helped Russia then Britain might join in and if it did, Italy was expected to remain neutral. About of the German army would operate in the west and in the east. Russia would begin an offensive because of its larger army and in anticipation of French involvement but if not, the German army would attack. After the Russian army had been defeated, the German army in the east would pursue the remnants. The German army in the west would stay on the defensive, perhaps conducting a counter-offensive but without reinforcements from the east. became a secondary deployment plan when the international situation made an isolated Russo-German war impossible. had the same flaw as , in that it was feared that a French offensive would be harder to defeat, if not countered with greater force, either slower as in or with greater force and quicker, as in .

===&quot;Plan XVII&quot;===

After amending &quot;Plan XVI&quot; in September 1911, Joffre and the staff took eighteen months to revise the French concentration plan, the concept of which was accepted on 18 April 1913. Copies of Plan XVII were issued to army commanders on 7 February 1914 and the final draft was ready on 1 May. The document was not a campaign plan but it contained a statement that the Germans were expected to concentrate the bulk of their army on the Franco-German border and might cross before French operations could begin. The instruction of the Commander in Chief was that

and that to achieve this, the French armies were to concentrate, ready to attack either side of Metz–Thionville or north into Belgium, in the direction of Arlon and Neufchâteau. An alternative concentration area for the Fourth and Fifth armies was specified, in case the Germans advanced through Luxembourg and Belgium but an enveloping attack west of the Meuse was not anticipated. The gap between the Fifth Army and the North Sea was covered by Territorial units and obsolete fortresses.

===Battle of the Frontiers===
When Germany declared war, France implemented &quot;Plan XVII&quot; with five attacks, later named the Battle of the Frontiers. The German deployment plan, II, concentrated German forces (less 20 per cent to defend Prussia and the German coast) on the German–Belgian border. The German force was to advance into Belgium, to force a decisive battle with the French army, north of the fortifications on the Franco-German border. &quot;Plan XVII&quot; was an offensive into Alsace-Lorraine and southern Belgium. The French attack into Alsace-Lorraine resulted in worse losses than anticipated, because artillery–infantry co-operation that French military theory required, despite its embrace of the &quot;spirit of the offensive&quot;, proved to be inadequate. The attacks of the French forces in southern Belgium and Luxembourg were conducted with negligible reconnaissance or artillery support and were bloodily repulsed, without preventing the westward manoeuvre of the northern German armies.

Within a few days, the French had suffered costly defeats and the survivors were back where they began. The Germans advanced through Belgium and northern France, pursuing the Belgian, British and French armies. The German armies attacking in the north reached an area north-east of Paris but failed to trap the Allied armies and force on them a decisive battle. The German advance outran its supplies; Joffre used French railways to move the retreating armies, re-group behind the river Marne and the Paris fortified zone, faster than the Germans could pursue. The French defeated the faltering German advance with a counter-offensive at the First Battle of the Marne, assisted by the British. Moltke the Younger had tried to apply the offensive strategy of I (a plan for an isolated Franco-German war, with all German forces deployed against France) to the inadequate western deployment of II (only 80 per cent of the army assembled in the west) to counter &quot;Plan XVII&quot;. In 2014, Terence Holmes wrote,

==History==

===Interwar===

====&quot;Der Weltkrieg&quot;====

Work began on &quot;Der Weltkrieg 1914 bis 1918: Militärischen Operationen zu Lande&quot; (The World War [from] 1914 to 1918: Military Operations on Land) in 1919 in the (War History Section) of the Great General Staff. When the Staff was abolished by the Treaty of Versailles, about eighty historians were transferred to the new in Potsdam. As President of the , General Hans von Haeften led the project, which was overseen from 1920 by a civilian historical commission. Theodor Jochim, the first head of the section for collecting documents, wrote that

The historians produced &quot;Der Weltkrieg&quot;, a narrative history (also known as the &quot;Weltkriegwerk&quot;) in fourteen volumes published from 1925 to 1944, which became the only source written with free access to the German documentary records of the war.

From 1920, semi-official histories had been written by Hermann von Kuhl, the 1st Army Chief of Staff in 1914, &quot;Der Deutsche Generalstab in Vorbereitung und Durchführung des Weltkrieges&quot; (The German General Staff in the Preparation and Conduct of the World War, 1920) and &quot;Der Marnefeldzug&quot; (The Marne Campaign) in 1921, by Lieutenant-Colonel Wolfgang Foerster, the author of &quot;Graf Schlieffen und der Weltkrieg&quot; (Count Schlieffen and the World War, 1925), Wilhelm Groener, head of (OHL, the wartime German General Staff) railway section in 1914, published &quot;Das Testament des Grafen Schlieffen: Operativ Studien über den Weltkrieg&quot; (The Testament of Count Schlieffen: Operational Studies of the World War) in 1929 and Gerhard Tappen, head of the OHL operations section in 1914, published &quot;Bis zur Marne 1914: Beiträge zur Beurteilung der Kriegführen bis zum Abschluss der Marne-Schlacht&quot; (Until the Marne 1914: Contributions to the Assessment of the Conduct of the War up to the Conclusion of the Battle of the Marne) in 1920. The writers called the Schlieffen Memorandum of 1905–1906 an infallible blueprint and that all Moltke the Younger had to do to almost guarantee that the war in the west would be won in August 1914, was implement it. The writers blamed Moltke for altering the plan to increase the force of the left wing at the expense of the right, which caused the failure to defeat decisively the French armies. By 1945, the official historians had also published two series of popular histories but in April, the building in Potsdam was bombed and nearly all of the war diaries, orders, plans, maps, situation reports and telegrams usually available to historians studying the wars of bureaucratic states, were destroyed.

====Hans Delbrück====
In his post-war writing, Delbrück held that the German General Staff had used the wrong war plan, rather than failed adequately to follow the right one. The Germans should have defended in the west and attacked in the east, following the plans drawn up by Moltke the Elder in the 1870s and 1880s. Belgian neutrality need not have been breached and a negotiated peace could have been achieved, since a decisive victory in the west was impossible and not worth the attempt. Like the before the war, this led to a long exchange between Delbrück and the official and semi-official historians of the former Great General Staff, who held that an offensive strategy in the east would have resulted in another 1812. The war could only have been won against Germany&#x27;s most powerful enemies, France and Britain. The debate between the Delbrück and Schlieffen &quot;schools&quot; rumbled on through the 1920s and 1930s.

===1940s – 1990s===
====Gerhard Ritter====
In &quot;Sword and the Sceptre; The Problem of Militarism in Germany&quot; (1969), Gerhard Ritter wrote that Moltke the Elder changed his thinking to accommodate the change in warfare evident since 1871, by fighting the next war on the defensive in general,

Moltke tried to resolve the strategic conundrum of a need for quick victory and pessimism about a German victory in a by resorting to , beginning with an offensive intended to weaken the opponent, eventually to bring an exhausted enemy to diplomacy, to end the war on terms with some advantage for Germany, rather than to achieve a decisive victory by an offensive strategy. In &quot;The Schlieffen Plan&quot; (1956, trans. 1958), Ritter published the Schlieffen Memorandum and described the six drafts that were necessary before Schlieffen was satisfied with it, demonstrating his difficulty of finding a way to win the anticipated war on two fronts and that until late in the process, Schlieffen had doubts about how to deploy the armies. The enveloping move of the armies was a means to an end, the destruction of the French armies and that the plan should be seen in the context of the military realities of the time.

====Martin van Creveld====
In 1980, Martin van Creveld concluded that a study of the practical aspects of the Schlieffen Plan was difficult, because of a lack of information. The consumption of food and ammunition at times and places are unknown, as are the quantity and loading of trains moving through Belgium, the state of repair of railway stations and data about the supplies which reached the front-line troops. Creveld thought that Schlieffen had paid little attention to supply matters, understanding the difficulties but trusting to luck, rather than concluding that such an operation was impractical. Schlieffen was able to predict the railway demolitions carried out in Belgium, naming some of the ones that caused the worst delays in 1914. The assumption made by Schlieffen that the armies could live off the land was vindicated. Under Moltke the Younger much was done to remedy the supply deficiencies in German war planning, studies being written and training being conducted in the unfashionable &quot;technics&quot; of warfare. Moltke introduced motorised transport companies, which were invaluable in the 1914 campaign; in supply matters, the changes made by Moltke to the concepts established by Schlieffen were for the better.

Creveld wrote that the German invasion in 1914 succeeded beyond the inherent difficulties of an invasion attempt from the north; peacetime assumptions about the distance infantry armies could march were confounded. The land was fertile, there was much food to be harvested and though the destruction of railways was worse than expected, this was far less marked in the areas of the 1st and 2nd armies. Although the amount of supplies carried forward by rail cannot be quantified, enough got to the front line to feed the armies. Even when three armies had to share one line, the six trains a day each needed to meet their minimum requirements arrived. The most difficult problem was to advance railheads quickly enough to stay close enough to the armies. By the time of the Battle of the Marne, all but one German army had advanced too far from its railheads. Had the battle been won, only in the 1st Army area could the railways have been swiftly repaired; the armies further east could not have been supplied.

German army transport was reorganised in 1908 but in 1914, the transport units operating in the areas behind the front line supply columns failed, having been disorganised from the start by Moltke crowding more than one corps per road, a problem that was never remedied but Creveld wrote that even so, the speed of the marching infantry would still have outstripped horse-drawn supply vehicles, if there had been more road-space; only motor transport units kept the advance going. Creveld concluded that despite shortages and &quot;hungry days&quot;, the supply failures did not cause the German defeat on the Marne, Food was requisitioned, horses worked to death and sufficient ammunition was brought forward in sufficient quantities so that no unit lost an engagement through lack of supplies. Creveld also wrote that had the French been defeated on the Marne, the lagging behind of railheads, lack of fodder and sheer exhaustion, would have prevented much of a pursuit. Schlieffen had behaved &quot;like an ostrich&quot; on supply matters which were obvious problems and although Moltke remedied many deficiencies of the (the German army supply system), only improvisation got the Germans as far as the Marne; Creveld wrote that it was a considerable achievement in itself.

====John Keegan====

In 1998, John Keegan wrote that Schlieffen had desired to repeat the frontier victories of the Franco-Prussian War in the interior of France but that fortress-building since that war had made France harder to attack; a diversion through Belgium remained feasible but this &quot;lengthened and narrowed the front of advance&quot;. A corps took up of road and was the limit of a day&#x27;s march; the end of a column would still be near the beginning of the march, when the head of the column arrived at the destination. More roads meant smaller columns but parallel roads were only about apart and with thirty corps advancing on a front, each corps would have about width, which might contain seven roads. This number of roads was not enough for the ends of marching columns to reach the heads by the end of the day; this physical limit meant that it would be pointless to add troops to the right wing.

Schlieffen was realistic and the plan reflected mathematical and geographical reality; expecting the French to refrain from advancing from the frontier and the German armies to fight great battles in the hinterland was found to be wishful thinking. Schlieffen pored over maps of Flanders and northern France, to find a route by which the right wing of the German armies could move swiftly enough to arrive within six weeks, after which the Russians would have overrun the small force guarding the eastern approaches of Berlin. Schlieffen wrote that commanders must hurry on their men, allowing nothing to stop the advance and not detach forces to guard by-passed fortresses or the lines of communication, yet they were to guard railways, occupy cities and prepare for contingencies, like British involvement or French counter-attacks. If the French retreated into the &quot;great fortress&quot; into which France had been made, back to the Oise, Aisne, Marne or Seine, the war could be endless.

Schlieffen also advocated an army (to advance with or behind the right wing), bigger by using untrained and over-age reservists. The extra corps would move by rail to the right wing but this was limited by railway capacity and rail transport would only go as far the German frontiers with France and Belgium, after which the troops would have to advance on foot. The extra corps &quot;appeared&quot; at Paris, having moved further and faster than the existing corps, along roads already full of troops. Keegan wrote that this resembled a plan falling apart, having run into a logical dead end. Railways would bring the armies to the right flank, the Franco-Belgian road network would be sufficient for them to reach Paris in the sixth week but in too few numbers to defeat decisively the French. Another would be necessary for which there was no room; Schlieffen&#x27;s plan for a quick victory was fundamentally flawed.

===1990s–present===
====German reunification====
In the 1990s, after the dissolution of the German Democratic Republic, it was discovered that some Great General Staff records had survived the Potsdam bombing in 1945 and been confiscated by Soviet Military Administration in Germany authorities. About and of documents were handed over to the (German Federal Archives) containing the working notes of historians, business documents, research notes, studies, field reports, draft manuscripts, galley proofs, copies of documents, newspaper clippings and other papers. The trove shows that is a &quot;generally accurate, academically rigorous and straightforward account of military operations&quot;, when compared to other contemporary official accounts. Six volumes cover the first of the war in of the series). The first volumes attempted to explain why the German war plans failed and who was to blame.

In 2002, &quot;RH 61/v.96&quot;, a summary of German war planning from 1893 to 1914 was discovered in records written from the late 1930s to the early 1940s. The summary was for a revised edition of the volumes of on the Marne campaign and was made available to the public. Study of pre-war German General Staff war planning and the other records, made an outline of German war-planning possible for the first time, proving many guesses wrong. An inference that &quot;all&quot; of Schlieffen&#x27;s war-planning was offensive, came from the extrapolation of his writings and speeches on &quot;tactical&quot; matters to the realm of &quot;strategy&quot;. In 2014, Terence Holmes wrote

and the most significant of these errors was an assumption that a model of a two-front war against France and Russia, was the &quot;only&quot; German deployment plan. The thought-experiment and the later deployment plan modelled an isolated Franco-German war (albeit with aid from German allies), the 1905 plan was one of three and then four plans available to the Great General Staff. A lesser error was that the plan modelled the decisive defeat of France in one campaign of fewer than forty days and that Moltke the Younger foolishly weakened the attack, by being over-cautious and strengthening the defensive forces in Alsace-Lorraine. had the more modest aim of forcing the French to choose between losing territory or committing the French army to a decisive battle, in which it could be terminally weakened and then finished off later

and Moltke made no more alterations to but came to prefer and tried to apply the offensive strategy of the former to the latter.

====Robert Foley====
In 2005, Robert Foley wrote that Schlieffen and Moltke the Younger had recently been severely criticised by Martin Kitchen, who had written that Schlieffen was a narrow-minded technocrat, obsessed with minutiae. Arden Bucholz had called Moltke too untrained and inexperienced to understand war planning, which prevented him from having a war policy from 1906 to 1911; it was the failings of both men that caused them to keep a strategy that was doomed to fail. Foley wrote that Schlieffen and Moltke had good reason to retain as the foundation of their planning, despite their doubts as to its validity. Schlieffen had been convinced that only in a short war was there the possibility of victory and that by making the army operationally superior to its potential enemies, could be made to work. The unexpected weakening of the Russian army in 1904–1905 and the exposure of its incapacity to conduct a modern war, which was expected to continue for a long time, made a short war possible again. Since the French had a defensive strategy, the Germans would have to take the initiative and invade France, which was shown to be feasible by war games in which French border fortifications were outflanked.

Moltke continued with the offensive plan, after it was seen that the enfeeblement of Russian military power had been for a much shorter period than Schlieffen had expected. The substantial revival in Russian military power that began in 1910 would certainly have matured by 1922, making the Tsarist army unbeatable. The end of the possibility of a short, eastern war and the certainty of increasing Russian military power meant that Moltke had to look to the west for a quick victory, before Russian mobilisation was complete. Speed meant an offensive strategy and made doubts about the possibility of forcing defeat on the French army irrelevant. The only way to avoid becoming bogged down in the French fortress zones was by a flanking move into terrain where open warfare was possible and the German army could fight a (a war of manoeuvre). Moltke used the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June 1914, as an excuse to attempt against France, before Russian rearmament deprived Germany of any hope of victory.

====Terence Holmes====
In 2013, Holmes published a summary of his thinking about the Schlieffen Plan and the debates about it in &quot;Not the Schlieffen Plan&quot;. He wrote that people believed that the Schlieffen Plan was for a grand offensive against France to gain a decisive victory in six weeks. The Russians would be held back and then defeated with reinforcements rushed by rail from the west. Holmes wrote that no-one had produced a source showing that Schlieffen intended a huge right-wing flanking move into France, &quot;in a two-front war&quot;. The 1905 Memorandum was for &quot;War against France&quot;, in which Russia would be unable to participate. Schlieffen had thought about such an attack on two general staff rides () in 1904, on the staff ride of 1905 and in the deployment plan I, for 1905–06 and 1906–07, in which all of the German army fought the French. In none of these plans was a two-front war contemplated; the common view that Schlieffen thought that such an offensive would guarantee victory in a two-front war was wrong. In his last exercise critique in December 1905, Schlieffen wrote that the Germans would be so outnumbered against France and Russia, that the Germans must rely on a counter-offensive strategy against both enemies, to eliminate one as quickly as possible.

In 1914, Moltke the Younger attacked Belgium and France with rather than the corps specified in the Schlieffen Memorandum, Moltke had insufficient troops to advance around the west side of Paris and six weeks later, the Germans were digging-in on the Aisne. The post-war idea of a six-week timetable, derived from discussions in May 1914, when Moltke had said that he wanted to defeat the French &quot;in six weeks from the start of operations&quot;. The deadline did not appear in the Schlieffen Memorandum and Holmes wrote that Schlieffen would have considered six weeks to be far too long to wait in a war against France &quot;and&quot; Russia. Schlieffen wrote that the Germans must &quot;wait for the enemy to emerge from behind his defensive ramparts&quot; and intended to defeat the French army by a counter-offensive, tested in the general staff ride west of 1901. The Germans concentrated in the west and the main body of the French advanced through Belgium into Germany. The Germans then made a devastating counter-attack on the left bank of the Rhine near the Belgian border. The hypothetical victory was achieved by the 23rd day of mobilisation; nine active corps had been rushed to the eastern front by the 33rd day for a counter-attack against the Russian armies. Even in 1905, Schlieffen thought the Russians capable of mobilising in and that the Germans had only three weeks to defeat the French, which could not be achieved by a promenade through France.

The French were required by the treaty with Russia, to attack Germany as swiftly as possible but could advance into Belgium only &quot;after&quot; German troops had infringed Belgian sovereignty. Joffre had to devise a plan for an offensive that avoided Belgian territory, which would have been followed in 1914, had the Germans not invaded Belgium first. For this contingency, Joffre planned for three of the five French armies (about of the French first-line troops) to invade Lorraine on 14 August, to reach the river Saar from Sarrebourg to Saarbrücken, flanked by the German fortress zones around Metz and Strasbourg. The Germans would defend against the French, who would be enveloped on three sides then the Germans would attempt an encircling manoeuvre from the fortress zones to annihilate the French force. Joffre understood the risks but would have had no choice, had the Germans used a defensive strategy. Joffre would have had to run the risk of an encirclement battle against the French First, Second and Fourth armies. In 1904, Schlieffen had emphasised that the German fortress zones were not havens but jumping-off points for a surprise counter-offensive. In 1914, it was the French who made a surprise attack from the (Paris fortified zone) against a weakened German army.

Holmes wrote that Schlieffen never intended to invade France through Belgium, in a war against France &quot;and&quot; Russia,

====Holmes–Zuber debate====

Zuber wrote that the Schlieffen Memorandum was a &quot;rough draft&quot; of a plan to attack France in a one-front war, which could not be regarded as an operational plan, as the memo was never typed up, was stored with Schlieffen&#x27;s family and envisioned the use of units not in existence. The &quot;plan&quot; was not published after the war when it was being called an infallible recipe for victory, ruined by the failure of Moltke adequately to select and maintain the aim of the offensive. Zuber wrote that if Germany faced a war with France and Russia, the real Schlieffen Plan was for defensive counter-attacks. Holmes supported Zuber in his analysis that Schlieffen had demonstrated in his thought-experiment and in , that corps (1.36 million front-line troops) was the &quot;minimum&quot; force necessary to win a &quot;decisive&quot; battle against France or to take strategically important territory. Holmes asked why Moltke attempted to achieve either objective with (970,000 first-line troops) only of the minimum required.

In the 1914 campaign, the retreat by the French army denied the Germans a decisive battle, leaving them to breach the &quot;secondary fortified area&quot; from the (Verdun fortified zone), along the Marne to the (Paris fortified zone). If this &quot;secondary fortified area&quot; could not be overrun in the opening campaign, the French would be able to strengthen it with field fortifications. The Germans would then have to break through the reinforced line in the opening stages of the next campaign, which would be much more costly. Holmes wrote that

Lack of troops made &quot;an empty space where the Schlieffen Plan requires the right-wing (of the German force) to be&quot;. In the final phase of the first campaign, the German right-wing was supposed to be &quot;outflanking that position (a line west from Verdun, along the Marne to Paris) by advancing west of Paris across the lower Seine&quot; but in 1914 &quot;Moltke&#x27;s right-wing was operating east of Paris against an enemy position connected to the capital city...he had no right-wing at all in comparison with the Schlieffen Plan&quot;. Breaching a defensive line from Verdun, west along the Marne to Paris, was impossible with the forces available, something Moltke should have known.

Holmes could not adequately explain this deficiency but wrote that Moltke&#x27;s preference for offensive tactics was well known and thought that, unlike Schlieffen, Moltke was an advocate of the &quot;strategic&quot; offensive,

The German offensive of 1914 failed because the French refused to fight a decisive battle and retreated to the &quot;secondary fortified area&quot;. Some German territorial gains were reversed by the Franco-British counter-offensive against the 1st Army ( Alexander von Kluck) and 2nd Army ( Karl von Bülow), on the German right (western) flank, during the First Battle of the Marne 

====Humphries and Maker====
In 2013, Mark Humphries and John Maker published &quot;Germany&#x27;s Western Front 1914&quot;, an edited translation of the volumes for 1914, covering German grand strategy in 1914 and the military operations on the Western Front to early September. Humphries and Maker wrote that the interpretation of strategy put forward by Delbrück had implications about war planning and began a public debate, in which the German military establishment defended its commitment to . The editors wrote that German strategic thinking was concerned with creating the conditions for a decisive (war determining) battle in the west, in which an envelopment of the French army from the north would inflict such a defeat on the French as to end their ability to prosecute the war within forty days. Humphries and Maker called this a simple device to fight France and Russia simultaneously and to defeat one of them quickly, in accordance with of German military tradition. Schlieffen may or may not have written the 1905 memorandum as a plan of operations but the thinking in it was the basis for the plan of operations devised by Moltke the Younger in 1914. The failure of the 1914 campaign was a calamity for the German Empire and the Great General Staff, which was disbanded by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.

Some of the writers of (The Frontier Battles in the West [1925]), the first volume of , had already published memoirs and analyses of the war, in which they tried to explain why the plan failed in terms that confirmed its validity. Foerster, head of the from 1920 and reviewers of draft chapters like Groener, had been members of the Great General Staff and were part of a post-war &quot;annihilation school&quot;. Under these circumstances, the objectivity of the volume can be questioned as an instalment of the &quot;battle of the memoirs&quot;, despite the claim in the foreword written by Foerster, that the would show the war as it actually happened (), in the tradition of Leopold von Ranke. It was for the reader to form conclusions and the editors wrote that though the volume might not be entirely objective, the narrative was derived from documents lost in 1945. The Schlieffen Memorandum of 1905 was presented as an operational idea, which in general was the only one that could solve the German strategic dilemma and provide an argument for an increase in the size of the army. The adaptations made by Moltke were treated in , as necessary and thoughtful sequels of the principle adumbrated by Schlieffen in 1905 and that Moltke had tried to implement a plan based on the 1905 memorandum in 1914. The historians&#x27;s version showed that Moltke had changed the plan and altered its emphasis because it was necessary in the conditions of 1914.

The failure of the plan was explained in by showing that command in the German armies was often conducted with vague knowledge of the circumstances of the French, the intentions of other commanders and the locations of other German units. Communication was botched from the start and orders could take hours or days to reach units or never arrive. , the decentralised system of command that allowed local commanders discretion within the commander&#x27;s intent, operated at the expense of co-ordination. Aerial reconnaissance had more influence on decisions than was sometimes apparent in writing on the war but it was a new technology, the results of which could contradict reports from ground reconnaissance and be difficult for commanders to resolve. It always seemed that the German armies were on the brink of victory, yet the French kept retreating too fast for the German advance to surround them or cut their lines of communication. Decisions to change direction or to try to change a local success into a strategic victory were taken by army commanders ignorant of their part in the OHL plan, which frequently changed. portrays Moltke in command of a war machine &quot;on autopilot&quot;, with no mechanism of central control.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

In 2001, Hew Strachan wrote that it is a cliché that the armies marched in 1914 expecting a short war, because many professional soldiers anticipated a long war. Optimism is a requirement of command and expressing a belief that wars can be quick and lead to a triumphant victory, can be an essential aspect of a career as a peacetime soldier. Moltke the Younger was realistic about the nature of a great European war but this conformed to professional wisdom. Moltke the Elder was proved right in his 1890 prognostication to the , that European alliances made a repeat of the successes of 1866 and 1871 impossible and anticipated a war of seven or thirty years&#x27; duration. Universal military service enabled a state to exploit its human and productive resources to the full but also limited the causes for which a war could be fought; Social Darwinist rhetoric made the likelihood of surrender remote. Having mobilised and motivated the nation, states would fight until they had exhausted their means to continue.

There had been a revolution in firepower since 1871, with the introduction of breech-loading weapons, quick-firing artillery and the evasion of the effects of increased firepower, by the use of barbed wire and field fortifications. The prospect of a swift advance by frontal assault was remote; battles would be indecisive and decisive victory unlikely. Major-General Ernst Köpke, the (Quartermaster General) of the German army in 1895, wrote that an invasion of France past Nancy would turn into siege warfare with no quick and decisive victory. Emphasis on operational envelopment came from the knowledge of a likely tactical stalemate. The problem for the German army was that a long war implied defeat, because France, Russia and Britain, the probable coalition of enemies, were far more powerful. The role claimed by the German army, as the anti-socialist foundation on which the social order was based, also made the army apprehensive about the internal strains that would be generated by a long war.

Schlieffen was faced by a contradiction between strategy and national policy and advocated a short war based on , because of the probability of a long one. Given the recent experience of military operations in the Russo-Japanese War, Schlieffen resorted to an assumption that international trade and domestic credit could not bear a long war and this tautology justified . Grand strategy, a comprehensive approach to warfare that took in economics and politics as well as military considerations, was beyond the capacity of the Great General Staff (as it was among the general staffs of rival powers). Moltke the Younger found that he could not dispense with Schlieffen&#x27;s offensive concept, because of the objective constraints that had led to it. Moltke was less certain and continued to plan for a short war, while urging the civilian administration to prepare for a long one, which only managed to convince people that he was indecisive.

By 1913, Moltke had a staff of to command an army five times greater than that of 1870, which would move on double the railway mileage [], relying on delegation of command, to cope with the increase in numbers and space and the decrease in the time available to get results. led to the stereotyping of decisions at the expense of flexibility to respond to the unexpected, something increasingly likely after first contact with the opponent. Moltke doubted that the French would conform to Schlieffen&#x27;s more optimistic assumptions. In May 1914 he said, &quot;I will do what I can. We are not superior to the French.&quot; and on the night of 1914, remarked that if Britain joined the anti-German coalition, no-one could foresee the duration or result of the war.

In 2006 the Center for Military History and Social Sciences of the Bundeswehr published a collection of essays derived from a conference in 2004 held at Potsdam to discuss Terence Zuber&#x27;s conclusion that there was no Schlieffen Plan. Had Zuber accurately interpreted his sources and were they adequate for his conclusions? The participants produced a comparative analysis of the war plans of the 1914 belligerents and Switzerland. In the Introduction to the volume, Hans Ehlert, Michael Epkenhans and Gerhard Gross wrote that Zuber&#x27;s conclusion that the plan was a myth was a surprise, because many German generals had recorded at the time that the campaign in August and September had been based on Schlieffen. Falkenhayn had made a diary note on 10 September 1914 that,

The Bavarian representative at the Great General Staff, General Karl von Wenninger wrote to Munich, that

Wenninger went on to write that only the final encirclement by the northern and southern wings of the German force had not been achieved. After the Battle of the Marne, Wenninger wrote on 16 February, that

Zuber maintained his thesis that the plan was a post-war fabrication, by former General Staff officers, to shift the blame for a lost war. Annika Mombauer wrote that Zuber had overlooked the intimate connexion between the military and political worlds and that trying to explain the war as the result of Schlieffen and Moltke&#x27;s desire for war risked falling for the post-war apologetics of the General Staff, that Schlieffen had created a plan that would inevitably bring victory. Robert Foley described the substantial changes in Germany&#x27;s strategic circumstances between 1905 and 1914 which compelled German planners to prepare for a quick one-front war which could only be fought against France, the evidence for which lay in Schlieffen&#x27;s staff rides, of which Zuber had taken too little account.

Gerhard Gross wrote that the sources used by Zuber were inadequate for his conclusions. Zuber had not looked at published excerpts from the pre-war (deployment commands) and the papers of General of Artillery , which included copies of Schlieffen papers and correspondence with Schlieffen&#x27;s friends and colleagues. The documents showed that Zuber had misunderstood Schlieffen&#x27;s operational thinking, which was based on obtaining a decisive victory against the French through envelopment on French territory but in a much less dogmatic way than had been thought. Gross agreed with Zuber that the of 1905 was not an operational plan for a war against France or a detailed plan for a two-front war. Dieter Storz wrote that plans and reality rarely match and that the extant Bavarian records bear out the basis of Schlieffen&#x27;s thinking, that the French armies were to be outflanked by the right wing. Günter Kronenbitter analysed the deployment plans of Austria-Hungary and concluded that, despite the alliance and relationship between the German and Austrian general staffs, there was no unified operational plan.

The Zuber thesis was the catalyst for a debate that suggested new questions and answers and turned up new sources. Zuber may not have convinced scholars but had been a considerable incentive for research. Zuber withheld permission for his chapter to be included in the English translation. The book includes the German deployment plans, long thought lost, which show Schlieffen&#x27;s operational assumptions and that the emphasis on envelopment was continued by Moltke, despite his changes of other aspects of the deployment plans.

In 2009, David Stahel wrote that the Clausewitzian &quot;culminating point&quot; (a theoretical watershed at which the strength of a defender surpasses that of an attacker) of the German offensive occurred &quot;before&quot; the Battle of the Marne, because the German right (western) flank armies east of Paris, were operating from the nearest rail-head, requiring week-long round-trips by underfed and exhausted wagon horses, which led to the right wing armies becoming disastrously short of ammunition. Stahel wrote that contemporary and subsequent German assessments of Moltke&#x27;s implementation of in 1914, did not criticise the planning and supply of the campaign, even though these were instrumental to its failure and that this failure of analysis had a disastrous sequel, when the German armies were pushed well beyond their limits in Operation Barbarossa, during 1941. In 2015, Holger Herwig wrote that Army deployment plans were not shared with the Imperial German Navy, Foreign Office, the Chancellor, the Austro-Hungarians or the Army commands in Prussia, Bavaria and the other German states. No one outside the Great General Staff could point out problems with the deployment plan or make arrangements. &quot;The generals who did know about it counted on it giving a quick victory within weeks—if that did not happen there was no &#x27;Plan B&#x27;&quot;.

<text>The Los Angeles Sparks are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Sparks compete in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) as a member of the Western Conference. The team plays its home games at Crypto.com Arena. The Sparks were founded before the league&#x27;s inaugural 1997 season began. Like some other WNBA teams, the Sparks have the distinction of not being affiliated with an NBA counterpart, even though the market is shared with the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers.

Lakers owner Jerry Buss owned the Sparks as a sister team to the Los Angeles Lakers from 1997 to 2006. Since 2014, the Sparks have been owned by Sparks LA Sports, a group consisting of Mark Walter, Magic Johnson, Stan Kasten, Todd Boehly, Bobby Patton, and Eric Holoman.

The Sparks have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in twenty of their twenty-four years in Los Angeles, more than any other team in the league. The franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as center and Tennessee standout Candace Parker, flashy point guard Nikki Teasley, and nearby USC alums Lisa Leslie and Tina Thompson. In 2001, 2002, 2003, 2016 and 2017, the Sparks went to the WNBA Finals. They won the title in 2001, 2002, and 2016, beating Charlotte, New York, and Minnesota respectively, but fell short to Detroit in 2003 and Minnesota in 2017.

== History ==

=== 1997–2000: Beginnings and bright future ===
The 1997 WNBA season, the league&#x27;s first, opened with a game between the Sparks and the New York Liberty at the Sparks home (The Forum) in Inglewood. The Sparks lost the game 57–67. Sparks player Penny Toler scored the league&#x27;s first two points with a lay-up 59 seconds into the game. The Sparks finished with a record of 14–14. The team did compete for a playoff spot, but because of a loss to the Phoenix Mercury in the final game of the season, the Sparks missed the playoffs. In the 1998 WNBA season, the Sparks finished 12–18, missing the playoffs once more.

The 1999 season featured the development of Lisa Leslie and the Sparks&#x27; first playoff berth, as the Sparks posted a 20–12 record. The Sparks won their first playoff game and series with a win over the Sacramento Monarchs. They played in the Western Conference Finals but fell to the defending champion Houston Comets, 2 games to 1, in the three-game series.
The 2000 season was a record one, as the Sparks had a 28–4 record, the best in league history, and second only to the 1998 Houston Comets for best all-time. In the playoffs, the Sparks swept the Phoenix Mercury in the first round but lost in the Western Conference Finals again, when they were swept by the Comets. Ultimately, the Sparks were playing in the shadow of the Comets, who won the first four WNBA championships.

=== 2001–2002: Back-to-back championships ===
The 2000–01 off-season saw a move to the Staples Center and a coaching change, when the Sparks hired former Los Angeles Lakers player Michael Cooper as head coach. During the ensuing regular season, the Sparks again posted a 28–4 record. In the 2001 playoffs, the Sparks finally eliminated the Comets, sweeping them in the first round. The Sparks took all three games to eliminate the Monarchs to earn their first berth in the WNBA Finals, in which they swept the Charlotte Sting, 2–0, for their first league championship.

In 2002, Leslie became the first woman in the league to dunk the ball during a game, and once again the Sparks dominated the regular season, posting a 25–7 record. The Sparks then flew through the playoffs, sweeping both the Seattle Storm and the Utah Starzz. In the finals, the Sparks were matched against the Liberty, who were still looking for their first championship. A late three-pointer in game 2 by Nikki Teasley gave the Sparks their second consecutive championship.

=== 2003: Chasing a three-peat ===
In 2003, the Sparks posted a 24–10 record and went into the playoffs looking for a &quot;three-peat&quot;. Both the first and the second rounds were forced to deciding third games, as they beat the Minnesota Lynx and Sacramento Monarchs. The Sparks then faced the upstart Detroit Shock in the Finals. The Shock were on a roll after having been the worst team in the WNBA in 2002. The Finals were a battle fueled by the relationship between head coaches Michael Cooper (Sparks) and Bill Laimbeer (Shock) which stemmed from their days in the NBA. The rough road to the finals and the tough play of the Shock wore down the Sparks, who lost the series two games to one and failed to three-peat.

=== 2004–2006: Further championship contention ===
During the 2003-04 off-season, the Sparks signed two players, Tamika Whitmore and Teresa Weatherspoon, who had played for the New York Liberty. When the season began, the Sparks got off to a great start, but coach Cooper left at mid-season to seek a coaching job in the NBA. The loss of their coach was a factor in the team&#x27;s so-so finish to the season, which ended with a record of 25–9. During the playoffs, the team lost in three games to the Sacramento Monarchs.

The Sparks never recovered through the 2005 season and finished with a 17–17 record. They barely made the playoffs as the number-four seed. In the first round, the Sparks were outplayed and swept by the eventual champion Monarchs.

In 2006, the Sparks played much better, posting a 25–9 record. In the playoffs, they defeated the Seattle Storm in three games. However, in the Western Conference finals, the Sparks&#x27; season was ended by the Monarchs for the third year in a row.

=== 2007: Rock bottom ===

After the 2006 season ended, team owner Jerry Buss announced he was selling the Sparks. On December 7, 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the sale to an investor group led by Kathy Goodman and Carla Christofferson. Goodman is a former executive for Intermedia Films. Christofferson is a litigation attorney for the O’Melveny &amp; Myers law firm and was Miss North Dakota USA in 1989. The day after the sale was announced, team star Lisa Leslie announced that she was pregnant and would not play in the 2007 season. The Sparks posted a league-worst 10–24 record, also the worst in Sparks history. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 1998.

=== 2008–2015: Lisa Leslie&#x27;s final years, the rise of Candace Parker, falling short and new ownership ===
Before the start of the 2008 season, the team&#x27;s prospects improved dramatically. Lisa Leslie returned to the team, and on April 9, 2008, the team used its number-one draft pick to select Candace Parker, the college player of the year, the morning after Parker had led the University of Tennessee Lady Vols to their second-straight NCAA championship.

In 2008, the Sparks posted a 20–14 record and finished third in the Western Conference. Parker had won Rookie of the Year and WNBA MVP, becoming the first player in WNBA history to win both awards in the same season. In the playoffs, the Sparks beat the Seattle Storm 2–1 to reach the Western Conference Finals and compete against the San Antonio Silver Stars. The Sparks were on track to win game 2 of the series, but Silver Star Sophia Young made a turn-around bank-shot with a second left on the clock to force the series to a deciding game three. The Sparks lost game three, and the Silver Stars moved on to the WNBA Finals.

Following the 2008 season, Parker announced that she was pregnant. To compensate for Parker&#x27;s absence, the Sparks signed native veteran superstar Tina Thompson (who had previously played for the former rival Houston Comets) and former Finals MVP Betty Lennox in free agency. With the addition of Thompson and Lennox, the Sparks added more championship experience and veteran leadership to their roster to them help them compete for another title.

The 2009 season had started poorly for the Sparks. Parker began the season on maternity leave, and Leslie suffered a knee injury early in the season. Both Leslie and Parker returned to the court in July, however, sparking a 10–2 run which turned an 8–14 start into an 18–16 regular-season record and clinching the Sparks&#x27; tenth playoff appearance in their 13-year history. In the first round of the playoffs, the Sparks defeated the Seattle Storm for the third time in four years. In the Western Conference Finals, the Sparks&#x27; lost to the eventual champion Phoenix Mercury in three games. The end of the 2009 playoff run marked the end of Leslie&#x27;s career as a player and Cooper&#x27;s second tenure as Sparks&#x27; head coach. In the off-season, former Sparks player Jennifer Gillom became the team&#x27;s new head coach.

With the acquisition of former All-Star point guard Ticha Penicheiro and Parker establishing herself as the team&#x27;s next franchise player, the 2010 Sparks believed they had the pieces to contend for a championship. However, Parker had season-ending shoulder surgery after the team started 3–7. Without her, the Sparks struggled, finishing 13–21, which was good enough to qualify them for fourth place in the Western Conference, but they were swept by the eventual champion Seattle Storm in the first round.

The 2011 season was eerily reminiscent of the previous year for the Sparks. The team started 4–3 but again Parker sustained an injury. Following three more losses, the Sparks fired head coach Gillom, promoting previous Sparks coach Joe Bryant. With Parker out until the end of the season, the Sparks headed into the All-Star break 6–8 and in fifth place. The Sparks finished the season three games out of the playoffs with a 15–19 record. Thompson would become a free agent and sign with the Seattle Storm.

In the 2012 season, the Sparks significantly improved, making it back to the playoffs since 2010, finishing second in the Western Conference with a 24–10 record. That same year they drafted Rookie of the Year and future MVP Nneka Ogwumike with the number-one pick. However, the Sparks were eliminated 2–0 in the first round by the Minnesota Lynx.

The team was owned by Williams Group Holdings (Paula Madison, majority owner) and Carla Christofferson, Nicholas J H, and Lisa Leslie (minority owners) until January 2014 when it was abruptly announced that WGH would relinquish all control. Paula Madison said that since becoming an owner in 2007, she and her family had lost $12 million, including $1.4 million in 2013. The team was temporarily absorbed by the league, and was then purchased by Sparks LA Sports, a group that included former NBA player Magic Johnson.

The 2014 and 2015 seasons would be disappointing for the Sparks as they had continued to be an underachieving playoff team, getting eliminated in the first round both years by the Phoenix Mercury and Minnesota Lynx respectively.

=== 2016: Champions once again ===
After making the playoffs in 2015, losing in the first round, the Sparks made subtle roster changes and improved the following year. Suddenly showing signs of championship contention, they finished with a 26–8 record and made it to the 2016 WNBA Playoffs. By this time, the Sparks had a &quot;Big Three&quot;, consisting of Candace Parker, Nneka Ogwumike and Kristi Toliver. They earned the number 2 seed in the league and received a double bye to the semi-finals with the WNBA&#x27;s new playoff format. The Sparks faced off against the Chicago Sky in the semi-finals and defeated the Sky 3 games to 1 to advance to the Finals for the first time since 2003. They faced the number 1 seeded Minnesota Lynx in the finals. They stole game 1 on the road when veteran forward Alana Beard made a game-winning jumper at the buzzer, lifting the team to a 78–76 victory. They lost game 2 79–60, but back in Los Angeles, put themselves one win away from their first title in over a decade with a dominant 92–75 game 3 victory. Even though they expected to clinch a championship on their home floor, they lost game 4 in a disappointing finish of 85–79. Game 5 was truly historic, against all odds, and swarmed with Minnesota fans, the 2016 WNBA MVP, Nneka Ogwumike grabbed an offensive rebound and made the game-winning shot to put the Sparks ahead 77–76 with 3.1 seconds remaining. The Sparks won their first championship since 2002 and their third championship in franchise history. Candace Parker was named the Finals MVP.

=== 2017–2020: Hunting more championships ===
Coming into the 2017 season, the Sparks had some changes made in their roster. Toliver left the Sparks in free agency to join the Washington Mystics, Chelsea Gray became the starting point guard, the Sparks traded for Odyssey Sims, drafted Sydney Wiese and retooled most of their bench, but kept their core intact. The Sparks once again finished as the second best team in the league with a 26–8 record with a double-bye to the semi-finals. The Sparks swept the Phoenix Mercury 3-0 in the semi-finals, advancing to the Finals for the second season in a row, setting up a rematch with the Lynx. In Game 1, Gray made a game-winning jumper with 2 seconds left to give the Sparks a 1-0 series lead. In Game 3, Parker set the Finals record for most steals in a game with 5 steals as the Sparks were up 2–1 in the Finals. With another opportunity to close out the series at home, the Sparks failed to deliver as they lost Game 4 80–69, extending the series to a deciding Game 5. The Sparks would lose Game 5, failing to win back-to-back championships.

In 2018, the Sparks continued to hold onto their core, but would underperform during the season, this time they would finish as the number 6 seed with a 19–15 record. They would start off their playoff run against the rival championship-defending Minnesota Lynx. They would defeat the Lynx 75–68, advancing to the second round. In the second round elimination game, the Sparks lost 96–64 to the Washington Mystics, ending their run of two consecutive finals appearances.

After the 2018 season, Brian Agler resigned as the coach of the Sparks. One month later, the Sparks announced that Derek Fisher had been hired as a replacement.

After the 2019 season, Penny Toler was dismissed as general manager.

=== 2021–present: Post-Parker playoff drought ===
Before the 2021 season, both Parker and Gray left the team in free agency. The Sparks failed to make playoffs for the first time since 2011.

On June 7, 2022, the Sparks and Fisher parted ways as head coach and general manager after the team started the year 5-7, despite the acquisition of Liz Cambage. Fisher went 54-46 as head coach during his Sparks tenure. Fred Williams took over as interim head coach, but the Sparks ultimately missed the playoffs once again.

For the 2023 season, Curt Miller was named the new head coach, and Karen Bryant was named the new general manager. The Sparks missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year, marking the first time in franchise history. They received the second overall pick in the draft lottery.

Before the 2024 season, Raegan Pebley was named the new general manager, while Nneka Ogwumike, the last remaining player from the 2016 championship team, departed the Sparks in free agency. Through trades, the Sparks acquired the fourth pick in the 2024 WNBA draft and, with their two lottery picks, selected Cameron Brink and Rickea Jackson. The Sparks finished the season with the league&#x27;s worst record and subsequently parted ways with Miller. Following the season, the Sparks once again received the second overall pick in the draft lottery.

=== Current home ===
The Los Angeles Sparks currently play in the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, California. The capacity for a Sparks game is 13,141 because the upper level is closed off (capacity for a Lakers game is 18,997). The Sparks have played in the Crypto.com Arena since 2001. They previously played at The Forum but stayed there for two years after the Lakers departed for Crypto.com Arena until the venue was purchased by a local church.

=== Uniforms ===
* 2021–present: Nike and the WNBA unveiled new designs for all of its teams, and announced new edition uniforms. The Sparks unveiled a white uniform for the first time; all white uniforms were placed under the &quot;Heroine&quot; series. The purple uniform became part of the &quot;Explorer&quot; series, while a black third uniform was released as part of the &quot;Rebel&quot; series. The &quot;Rebel&quot; uniforms are similar to the NBA&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; edition in that it evokes city or team culture and pride.
* 2018–2020: Nike replaced Adidas as uniform provider. EquiTrust remains jersey sponsor, while slight tweaks were made in the fonts and striping. Similar to the NBA, Nike&#x27;s WNBA uniforms were classified under the &quot;Icon&quot; and &quot;Statement&quot; series, with the Sparks&#x27; gold and purple jerseys designated as such.
* 2015–2017: EquiTrust Life Insurance becomes new jersey sponsor; jersey remains unchanged other than the addition of the name of the sponsor. 
* 2013–2014: Farmers Insurance naming rights expire, and the team name returns on both jerseys. In addition a modified font for the jersey numbers was introduced.
* 2011–2012: As part of the move to Adidas&#x27;s Revolution 30 technology, the Sparks unveiled new jerseys. Home uniforms remain gold, but numbers are now rounded and in white with purple trim. Away uniforms are purple with numbers in white with gold trim. The Farmers Insurance name will remain on the jerseys.
* 2009–2010: On June 5, the Los Angeles Sparks and Farmers Insurance Group of Companies announced a multi-year marketing partnership that includes a branded jersey sponsorship. The Farmers Insurance branded jersey was worn by the players for the first time on June 6, 2009. As part of this alliance, the Farmers Insurance name and logo will appear on the front of the Sparks jerseys. In the 2009 season, the Sparks yellow jersey is used regardless of home or away. In the 2010 season they introduced the purple jersey for away games.
* 2007–2008: For home games, gold with purple lines and sparks on the side, with the name &quot;Sparks&quot; written across in purple. For away games, purple with golden yellow lines and sparks on the side, with the name &quot;Los Angeles&quot; in yellow. The uniform looks similar to the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; uniform.
* 1997–2006: For home games, gold with large purple stripe on the side, with the name &quot;Sparks&quot; written across in purple. For away games, purple with large gold stripe on the side, with the name &quot;Los Angeles&quot; in yellow.

== Media coverage ==
Currently, some Sparks games are broadcast on Spectrum SportsNet, a local television channel in the Southern California area, after agreeing to a multi-year broadcast deal with Time Warner Cable in March 2012 which was later acquired by Charter Communications in May 2016. Broadcasters for the Sparks games are Larry Burnett and Lisa Leslie. Previously, Sparks games were found on Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket and former analysts have included Derek Fisher and Ann Meyers.

Some Sparks games are broadcast nationally on ESPN, ESPN2, Ion Television, CBS, CBS Sports Network and ABC.

Currently, the team&#x27;s games are not on radio; however, the team did bounce around several stations from 1999 to 2008. The first two years had no broadcasts. Then in 1999, the team signed with KWKU, a sister station to Spanish-language KWKW, licensed to Pomona, California. According to an article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published in this period, KWKU had no switchboard and no website. In addition, its 500-watt signal reached only a handful of people in the greater L.A. area and was certainly nowhere near the team&#x27;s home arenas. In 2003, the team left KWKU for KLAC, which had summer time slots available after the Anaheim Angels&#x27; radio broadcasts had just left. That lasted until 2006, when KLAC switched the broadcasts to XETRA, which carried the same format KLAC had before. In 2007, the game broadcasts moved again, this time to KTLK, when XETRA switched its language of broadcasts from English to Spanish. The Sparks and Clear Channel Communications (licensee of the last three stations mentioned) chose not to renew their contract after 2008. Sparks radio broadcasts never covered a complete season; most nationally-televised games and many games from the Eastern time zone were not covered. Burnett was the announcer.

<text>Alfred, Count of Schlieffen (; 28 February 1833 – 4 January 1913) was a German field marshal and strategist who served as chief of the Imperial German General Staff from 1891 to 1906. His name lived on in the 1905–06 &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot;, then &quot;Aufmarsch I&quot;, a deployment plan and operational guide for a decisive initial offensive operation/campaign in a two-front war against the French Third Republic.

==Biography==
Born in Prussia, Germany, on 28 February 1833, the son of a Prussian Army officer, he was part of an old Prussian noble family, the Schlieffen family. He lived with his father, Major Magnus von Schlieffen, on their estate in Silesia, which he left to go to school in 1842. The young Schlieffen had shown no interest in joining the military and so he did not attend the traditional Prussian cadet academies. Instead, he studied at the University of Berlin. While he was studying law, he enlisted in the army in 1853 for his one year of compulsory military service. Then, instead of joining the reserves, he was chosen as an officer candidate. He thus started a long military career, working his way up through the officer ranks, eventually completing 53 years of service.

In 1868, fifteen years into his military career, Schlieffen married his cousin Countess Anna Schlieffen. They had one healthy child (Elisabeth Auguste Marie Ernestine Gräfin von Schlieffen, 13 September 1869 – 23 September 1943), but after the birth of a second (Marie, who became a nun), his wife died. Schlieffen then focused all of his attention on his military work.

==Military service==
On the recommendation of his commanders, Schlieffen was admitted to the General War School in 1858 at the age of 25, much earlier than others. He graduated in 1861 with high honours, which guaranteed him a role as a General Staff officer. In 1862, he was assigned to the Topographic Bureau of the General Staff, providing him with geographical knowledge and a respect for the tactical and strategic value of terrain and weather that would serve him well throughout his career, particularly in the war games he conducted and in the devising of various war plans including the famous Schlieffen Plan. In 1865 he was transferred to the German General Staff proper, though his role was initially a minor one. He first saw active war service as a staff officer with the Prussian Cavalry Corps at the Battle of Königgrätz of 1866, during the Austro-Prussian War. The tactical &quot;battle of encirclement&quot; conducted there was from that point forward a constant feature of his tactical doctrine, even as his strategic doctrine consistently favoured the counter-offensive due to both his understanding of the terrain and his respect for von Clausewitz&#x27;s assessment of the constantly-diminishing strength of the offensive.

During the Franco-Prussian War, he commanded a small force in the Loire Valley in what was one of the most difficult campaigns fought by the Prussian Army. In France, Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, promoted him to Major and head of the military history division. After years working alongside Helmuth von Moltke and Alfred von Waldersee, on 4 December 1886 he was promoted to Major General, and shortly afterwards, with the retirement of Moltke, became Waldersee&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff. Not long after this he became &quot;Quartermeistergeneral&quot;, then Lieutenant General on 4 December 1888, and eventually General of the Cavalry on 27 January 1893.

In 1904, on the occasion of the Herero rebellion in German South West Africa (present-day Namibia), Chief of the General Staff Schlieffen was supportive of Lothar von Trotha&#x27;s genocidal policies against the Herero and Namaqua peoples, saying &quot;The race war, once commenced, can only be ended by annihilation or the complete enslavement of one party&quot;. He agreed in principle with Trotha&#x27;s notorious &quot;Vernichtungsbefehl&quot; (&quot;extermination order&quot;) of 2 October 1904, even justifying the many cases of killing of Herero women by the Germans, writing &quot;If ... women have been shot, then one must remember that women have not only participated in the fighting, they have also been the main originators of the cruel and horrible martyrdom that our wounded have often been subjected to, and that the sight of these victims ... provoked the comrades to forgivable fury.&quot; Only after the intervention of Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow and the fear that Germany&#x27;s international image will be stained did Schlieffen agree, in December 1904, to repeal Trotha&#x27;s orders to kill on the spot unarmed and surrendering Hereros.

In August 1905, at the age of 72, Schlieffen was kicked by a companion&#x27;s horse, making him &quot;incapable of battle&quot;. After nearly 53 years of service, Schlieffen retired on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1906. He died on 4 January 1913, just 19 months before the outbreak of the First World War. His last words are said to have been, &quot;Remember: keep the right wing very strong&quot; (in reference to the main strategic manoeuvre of &quot;Aufmarsch I West&quot;), but the tale is believed to be apocryphal and to have originated decades after his death.

==The German Army==
For Schlieffen, the smaller rate of conscription into the German army (55 per cent, compared to France&#x27;s rate of 80 per cent), created a numerical imbalance, which was worsened by the Franco-Russian Alliance of 1896. German tactical and operational abilities could not compensate for this quantitative inferiority. Schlieffen had wanted to institute universal conscription and raise as many combat units from trained reservists as possible. Conscription policy was controlled by the Prussian Ministry of War, which answered to the . Schlieffen planned to create masses of new units when war came, when he would assume command of the army. Upon mobilisation, large numbers of reservists would be assigned to replacement battalions (), while waiting to join the field army.

From June 1891, Schlieffen proposed to form into brigades in the field army but the units were not effective forces. Replacement units as field units would also not be able to replace field army casualties. The War Ministry rejected Schlieffen&#x27;s proposals, and nothing was done until 1911, six years after Schlieffen&#x27;s retirement, when six divisions were formed by General Erich Ludendorff. Schlieffen continued to believe in the mass use of , making them fundamental to the (memorandum or think piece) which became known as the Schlieffen Plan (January 1906). The was not a campaign plan, as Schlieffen had retired on 31 December 1905 and the 96 divisions needed to carry out this one-front war plan did not exist (in 1914 the German army had 79, of which 68 were deployed in the west). Rather, it was a demonstration of what Germany might accomplish if universal conscription was introduced.

Schlieffen thought that even this hypothetical 96-division German army would probably not be able to defeat France,

Without twelve divisions on the right flank (in 1914 the German army had six which operated in Lorraine), outflanking Paris was impossible. Schlieffen admitted in the that units could not catch the right wing by foot-marching, nor would the rail system suffice to move twelve divisions to Paris. If they could not be sent to the right wing, they could be deployed practically anywhere else on the German front, either between Verdun and Mézières, at Metz or on the right bank of the Moselle. There is no evidence that Schlieffen conducted an exercise to test a scheme of manoeuvre similar to the one in the , an envelopment of Paris by the right flank, which would be surprising if this represented the pinnacle of Schlieffen&#x27;s strategic thought. None of Schlieffen&#x27;s surviving deployment plans (), General staff rides () or war games () bear any resemblance to the manoeuvre of the Schlieffen Plan; the plans are consistent with Schlieffen&#x27;s counter-attack doctrine. On 11 December 1893 Schlieffen wrote a that represented the completion of his idea of mass warfare. When war came, the German government ought to declare full mobilisation in East Prussia, owing to its vulnerability to Russian cavalry raids. The East Prussian militia would use prepared equipment; behind this militia screen the German field army would deploy and then throw back the Russians.

==War planning==


The cornerstone of Schlieffen&#x27;s war planning was undoubtedly the strategic counter-offensive. Schlieffen was a great believer in the power of the attack in the context of the defensive operation. Germany&#x27;s smaller forces relative to the Franco-Russian Entente meant that an offensive posture against one or both was basically suicidal. On the other hand, Schlieffen placed great faith in Germany&#x27;s ability to use its railways to launch a counter-offensive against a hypothetical French or Russian invasion force, defeat it, then quickly re-group her troops and launch a counter-offensive against the other. To quote Holmes:

Schlieffen also recognised the need for &quot;offensive&quot; planning, however, as failing to do so would limit the German Army&#x27;s capabilities if the situation called for them. In 1897, starting from a plan of 1894, Schlieffen developed a tactical plan that – acknowledging the German army&#x27;s limited offensive power and capacity for strategic manoeuvres – basically amounted to using brute force to advance beyond the French defences on the Franco-German border. To complement this unsophisticated manoeuvre and improve its chances of success he deemed it necessary to outflank the fortress line to the north and focus on destroying it from north–south starting at Verdun. This was a &quot;tactical&quot; plan centred around the destruction of the fortress-line that called for very little movement by the forces involved.

In 1905, however, Schlieffen developed what was truly his first plan for a &quot;strategic offensive operation&quot; – the &quot;Schlieffen plan Denkschrift&quot; (Schlieffen plan memorandum). This plan was based on the hypothesis of an isolated Franco-German war which &quot;would not&quot; involve Russia and called for Germany to attack France. The rough draft of this plan was so crude as not to consider questions of supply at all and be vague on the actual number of troops involved, but theorised that Germany would need to raise at least another 100,000 professional troops and 100,000 &quot;ersatz&quot; militiamen (the latter being within Germany&#x27;s capabilities even in 1905) in addition to being able to count on Austro-Hungarian and Italian forces being deployed to German Alsace-Lorraine to defend it. The German Army would then move through the Dutch province of Limburg and northern Belgium, securing southern Belgium and Luxembourg with a flank-guard to protect both Germany and the main force from a French offensive during this critical manoeuvre [this being the point of the 1913 French Plan XVII].

Another factor considered for the plan was the size of armies of Germany herself and her enemies. Schlieffen calculated that Germany would have peacetime strength of 612,000, which is stronger than 593,000 of France. While the size of Russia&#x27;s population and army was terrifying in one glance, Schlieffen did not considered it as a great threat for his plans. Witnessing the Russo-Japanese War and humiliating defeat of the Russian Army, Schlieffen did not consider Russia as a great threat, considering their poor railway systems.

But it is here, in the second and final phase of the operation, that Schlieffen shows his true genius: he notes the immense strength of the French &quot;second defensive area&quot; in which the French can use the fortress-sector of Verdun, &quot;Fortress Paris&quot;, and the River Marne as the basis of a &quot;very&quot; strong defensive line. Appreciating its defensive power, Schlieffen knew that he would have to try to force the French back from the Marne or at least secure a bridgehead over the Marne and/or Seine if he did not want the second German operation/campaign of the war to result in heavy losses. To do this, Schlieffen insisted that they cross the Seine &quot;to the west&quot; of Paris and, if they managed to cross in strength against sufficiently weak opposition, then they might even be able to force the French back from the westernmost sections of the Marne and surround Paris.

However, the bulk of Schlieffen&#x27;s planning still followed his personal preferences for the counter-offensive. &quot;Aufmarsch II&quot; and &quot;Aufmarsch Ost&quot; (later &quot;Aufmarsch II West&quot; and &quot;Aufmarsch I Ost&quot;, respectively) continued to stress that Germany&#x27;s best hope for survival if faced by a war with the Franco-Russian entente was a defensive strategy. This &quot;defensive strategy&quot;, was reconciled with a very offensive &quot;tactical&quot; posture as Schlieffen held that the &quot;destruction&quot; of an attacking force required that it be surrounded and attacked from all sides until it surrendered, and not merely repulsed as in a &quot;passive&quot; defense:

In August 1905 Schlieffen was kicked by a companion&#x27;s horse, making him &quot;incapable of battle&quot;. During his time off, now at the age of 72, he started planning his retirement. His successor was yet undetermined. Goltz was the primary candidate, but the Emperor was not fond of him. A favourite of the Emperor was Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, who became Chief of Staff after Schlieffen retired.

Moltke went on to devise &quot;Aufmarsch II Ost&quot;, a variant upon Schlieffen&#x27;s &quot;Aufmarsch Ost&quot; designed for an isolated Russo-German war. Schlieffen seems to have tried to impress upon Moltke that an offensive strategy against France could work only for isolated Franco-German war, as German forces would otherwise be too weak to implement it. Thus, Moltke still attempted to apply the offensive strategy of &quot;Aufmarsch I West&quot; to the two-front war Germany faced in 1914 and Schlieffen&#x27;s defensive plan &quot;Aufmarsch II West&quot;. With too few troops to cross west of Paris, let alone attempt a crossing of the Seine, Moltke&#x27;s campaign failed to breach the French &quot;second defensive sector&quot; and his troops were pushed back in the Battle of the Marne.

== Influence ==
Schlieffen was perhaps the best-known contemporary strategist of his time, but he was criticised for his &quot;narrow-minded military scholasticism.&quot;

Schlieffen&#x27;s operational theories were to have a profound impact on the development of manoeuvre warfare in the 20th century, largely through his treatise, &quot;Cannae&quot;, which concerned the decidedly un-modern 216 BCE Battle of Cannae in which Hannibal defeated the Romans. His treatise had two main purposes. First, it was to clarify, in writing, Schlieffen&#x27;s concepts of manoeuvre, particularly the manoeuvre of encirclement, along with other fundamentals of warfare. Second, it was to be an instrument for the Staff, the War Academy, and for the Army all together. His theories were studied exhaustively, especially in the higher army academies of the United States and Europe after the First World War. American military thinkers thought so highly of him that his principal literary legacy, &quot;Cannae&quot;, was translated at Fort Leavenworth and distributed within the US Army and to the academic community.

Along with the great militarist man that Schlieffen is famous for being, there are also underlying traits about Schlieffen that often go untold. As we know, Schlieffen was a strategist. Unlike the Chief of Staff, Waldersee, Schlieffen avoided political affairs and instead was actively involved in the tasks of the General Staff, including the preparation of war plans and the readiness of the German Army for war. He focused much of his attention on planning. He devoted time to training, military education and the adaptation of modern technology for the use of military purposes and strategic planning.

It was evident that Schlieffen was very much involved in preparing and planning for future combat. He considered one of his primary tasks was to prepare the young officers to act responsibly in planning manoeuvres but also to direct these movements after the planning had taken place.

With regards to Schlieffen&#x27;s tactics, General Walter Bedell Smith, chief of staff to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in the Second World War, pointed out that General Dwight Eisenhower and many of his staff officers, products of these academies, &quot;were imbued with the idea of this type of wide, bold maneuver for decisive results.&quot;

General Erich Ludendorff, a disciple of Schlieffen who applied his teachings of encirclement in the Battle of Tannenberg, once famously christened Schlieffen as &quot;one of the greatest soldiers ever.&quot;

Long after his death, the German General Staff officers of the interwar period and the Second World War, particularly General Hans von Seeckt, recognised an intellectual debt to Schlieffen theories during the development of the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; doctrine. The original plan for the 1940 German invasion of France was based on the Schlieffen Plan. Adolf Hitler, however, is said to have deprecated Schlieffen&#x27;s memory, going so far as to command that Schlieffen&#x27;s name never be uttered in his presence and to admonish Walter Scherff, official chronicler of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, to omit Schlieffen&#x27;s name from any histories he might write.

<text>Silo (died 783) was the king of Asturias from 774 to 783, succeeding Aurelius. He came to the throne upon his marriage to Adosinda, daughter of Alfonso I (&quot;Alfonso the Catholic&quot;). He moved the capital of the Kingdom of Asturias from Cangas de Onís to Pravia, closer to the center of the kingdom. He was a contemporary of Abd al-Rahman I, Umayyad Emir of Córdoba, and of Charlemagne.

==Life==

===Accession to the throne===
In Silo&#x27;s time, monarchs were apparently elected by the nobility as in the earlier Visigothic Kingdom. Monarchs were chosen from among a small number of dynasties. Preference tended to go to the son of a king or, where that was not possible, to the husband of a king&#x27;s daughter, as had happened in the case of Alfonso and of Silo himself, or, failing that, to another male of royal lineage thought capable of governing.

Nevertheless, there is academic controversy about the mode of succession: election after the Visigothic style, matrilineal succession according to indigenous practice, and hereditary in royal lineages. Each of these theories leads to a somewhat different account of Silo&#x27;s accession to the throne.

===Reign===
According to the &quot;Chronicon Albeldense&quot;, Silo kept peace with the Muslims &quot;ob causam matris&quot;, &quot;for his mother&#x27;s sake&quot;. The meaning of this phrase has been debated by scholars. It could mean that his mother was a Muslim with some sort of connection to the Umayyad Emir Abd al-Rahman I, or that she was a hostage of Abd al-Rahman in Córdoba, or it could mean yet something else.
One could explain the inactivity of the Muslims with respect to the Kingdom of Asturias by the fact that Silo&#x27;s reign coincided with the intervention of Charlemagne in Spain in 778. Charlemagne could not maintain the siege of Zaragoza and had to retire by way of Roncesvalles, suffering a great defeat there, and the subsequent campaign of Abd-al-Rahman I in 781 into the Ebro Valley in revenge against those who had been favorably disposed toward the French invasion.

Conversely, within the Kingdom of Asturias, during Silo&#x27;s reign Galicia rebelled for the second time, having done so before during the reign of Fruela I. The chronicles do not elucidate the motives for the rebellion. The rebel army faced Silo&#x27;s troops in the Battle of Montecubeiro in what is now the Province of Lugo, where he defeated them, ending the rebellion.

The oldest known medieval written document in the Iberian Peninsula dates from Silo&#x27;s reign. The &quot;Diploma del Rei Don Sílo&quot; (&quot;Diploma of King Silo&quot;) dates from 23 August 775. In this contractual document of donation &quot;pro anima&quot; (&quot;for the sake of the soul&quot;), Silo granted particular properties in the village of &quot;Tabulata&quot; (now Trabada) in &quot;Lucis&quot; (Lugo) to a group of monks, with the intention that they would found a monastery.

=== Moving the court to Pravia ===
Upon ascending to the throne, Silo moved the capital from Cangas de Onís to Pravia, the region in which he was a local magnate, a landed aristocrat. The new capital had the strategic advantage that Pravia, an ancient Roman settlement, was located in the valley of the Nalón River along the Roman road to &quot;Asturica Augusta&quot;, now Astorga. Furthermore, once Silo extended the frontiers of the realm to Galicia, Cangas de Onís was now quite far from the center of his kingdom.

== Death and succession ==
Silo died in Pravia in 783. The Estoria de España or Primera Crónica General says of his death:

After his death, Silo&#x27;s widow Adosinda engineered the election of her nephew Alfonso, son of Fruela I, as successor. The adolescent was named governor of the &quot;Palatium Regis&quot;, roughly chancellor. The throne was then seized by Mauregato, son of Alfonso I and of a slave woman of Muslim origin.

==Burial==
Silo was entombed in the Church of San Juan Apóstol y Evangelista, Santianes de Pravia, which he had ordered built. The tomb believed to be his and Adosinda&#x27;s remains there to this day. Nonetheless, the Maestro Custodio is said to have stated that Silo&#x27;s remains were moved to the monastery of San Juan de las Dueñas in the city of Oviedo, and re-interred behind the main altar there.

<doc id="179835" wikidata="Q316042" url="?curid=179835" title="Olaf III of Norway">
<text>Olaf III or Olaf Haraldsson (Old Norse: &quot;Óláfr Haraldsson&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Olav Haraldsson&quot;; – 22 September 1093), known as Olaf the Peaceful (Old Norse: &quot;Óláfr kyrri&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;Olav Kyrre&quot;), was King of Norway from 1067 until his death in 1093.

He was present at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in England in 1066 where his father, King Harald Hardrada, saw defeat and was killed in action, an event that directly preceded his kingship. During his rule, Olaf made peace with regards to earlier royal conflicts with the church, strengthened the power of the monarchy, and is traditionally credited with founding the city of Bergen circa 1070. Around 1225, Snorri Sturluson wrote &quot;Olav Kyrres saga&quot; about King Olaf in the Heimskringla.

== Biography ==
Olaf was a son of King Harald Hardrada and Tora Torbergsdatter. Olaf joined his father during the invasion of England during 1066. However, he was only 16 years old during the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September 1066. He stayed guarding the ships at Riccall and did not participate in the fighting. After the Norwegian defeat, he sailed with the remains of the Norwegian strike force back to Orkney, where they wintered. The return journey to Norway took place in summer 1067.

After the death of his father, Olaf shared the kingdom with his brother Magnus II (&quot;Magnus 2 Haraldsson&quot;) who had become king the previous year. When King Magnus died during 1069, Olaf became the sole ruler of Norway.

During his reign, the nation of Norway experienced a rare extended period of peace. He renounced any offensive foreign policy, instead protecting Norway&#x27;s sovereignty through agreements and marriage connections. Domestically he emphasized the church&#x27;s organization and the modernization of the kingdom. The latter resulted in, among other things, the reorganization of the body-guard and of measures under which key cities, especially Bergen, could better serve as a royal residence. According to the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; by Snorri Sturluson, Olaf is said to have founded the city of Bergen (originally called Bjørgvin).

The death of Harald Hardrada and the serious defeat suffered by the Norwegians in 1066 tempted the Danish king, Svend Estridsen, to prepare for an attack on Norway. King Svend no longer felt bound by the ceasefire agreement signed with Harald Hardrada in 1064, since it would only be valid for the two kings during their own lives. However Olaf made peace with King Svend and married the king&#x27;s daughter Ingerid. Later, Olav&#x27;s half sister Ingegerd married King Svend&#x27;s son Olaf. Although there were some attacks on England by Danish forces, peace persisted between Denmark and Norway. Olaf also made peace with William the Conqueror of England.

King Olaf broke with his father&#x27;s line in his relationship to the church. Harald Hardrada had developed a continuing conflict with the Archbishopric of Bremen due to the archbishop&#x27;s authority over the Norwegian church. Unlike his father, Olav recognized that authority fully. Political considerations may have been behind this conciliatory attitude, as may have been Olaf&#x27;s concern with the church organization. Until his time bishops had formed part of the king&#x27;s court and traveled with him around the country to take care of the ecclesiastical affairs while the king took care of worldly matters. The bishops established fixed residence in Oslo, Nidaros and Bergen. King Olaf also took the initiative for the construction of churches, including Christ Church in Bergen and Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim.

Olaf strengthened the power of the king and instituted the system of guilds in Norway. There are strong indications that the government of King Olaf began writing secure provincial laws to a greater extent. The Norwegian law Gulatingsloven was probably put in writing for the first time during his reign.

King Olaf died of illness on 22 September 1093 in Haukbø, Rånrike, then part of Norway (now Håkeby, Tanum Municipality, Sweden). He was buried at the Nidaros Cathedral. His marriage to Ingerid did not produce any children. His successor as king, Magnus III nicknamed Magnus Barefoot (&quot;Magnus Berrføtt&quot;), was acknowledged to be his illegitimate son.

== Appearance and character ==
The Morkinskinna () describes Olaf III as:

*&quot;[A] tall man, and everyone agrees that there has never been seen a fairer man or a man of nobler appearance.&quot;
*&quot;He had blond hair, a light complexion, and pleasing eyes, and he was well proportioned. He was taciturn for the most part, and not much of a speechmaker, though he was good company after drink.&quot;

Another description is found in the Heimskringla of Snorri Sturluson:

*&quot;Olaf was a stout man, well grown in limbs; and every one said a handsomer man could not be seen, nor of a nobler appearance.&quot;
*&quot;His hair was yellow as silk, and became him well; his skin was white and fine over all his body; his eyes beautiful, and his limbs well proportioned. He was rather silent in general, and did not speak much even at Things; but he was merry in drinking parties. He loved drinking much, and was talkative enough then; but quite peaceful.&quot;
*&quot;He was cheerful in conversation, peacefully inclined during all his reign, and loving gentleness and moderation in all things.&quot;

== Memorial ==
A memorial to King Olaf Kyrre was placed in Bergen, Norway in connection with the city&#x27;s 900-year anniversary. The abstract equestrian statue by noted Norwegian sculptor Knut Steen was unveiled on 21 May 1998.

== The &quot;Maine penny&quot; ==

The Maine penny - a Norwegian silver coin discovered in the US State of Maine in 1957 and suggested as evidence of Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact - has been dated to the time of Olaf III. The circumstances of its arrival from Norway to a Native American village in the present US territory remain unclear and highly disputed.

<text>Mauregatus the Usurper () was the king of Asturias from 783 to 788 or 789. He was an illegitimate son of Alfonso I, supposedly by a Moorish serf. He usurped the throne on the death of Silo, the husband of his half sister Adosinda, earning himself the nickname of the Usurper. The nobility had elected Alfonso II at Adosinda&#x27;s insistence, but Mauregatus assembled a large army of supporters and forced Alfonso into exile in Álava.

According to folklore, Mauregatus and Moorish rulers agreed to the apocryphal &quot;Tribute of the 100 Maidens,&quot; which gifted the Moors 100 Asturian virgins annually as repayment for their assistance in Mauregatus&#x27; rise to the throne. This arrangement supposedly ended after Ramiro I&#x27;s defeat of the Moors at the legendary Battle of Clavijo.

After six years in power, he died of natural causes in 789 and was buried in the Church of San Juan Apóstol y Evangelista in Pravia. Following his death, Bermudo I was chosen as his successor.

<doc id="179838" wikidata="Q1530090" url="?curid=179838" title="United Linux">
<text>United Linux was an attempt by a consortium of Linux distributors to create a common base distribution for enterprise use, so as to minimize duplication of engineering effort and form an effective competitor to Red Hat. The founding members of United Linux were SUSE, Turbolinux, Conectiva (now merged with &quot;MandrakeSoft&quot; to form Mandriva) and Caldera International (later renamed to The SCO Group). The consortium was announced on May 30, 2002. The end of the project was announced on January 22, 2004.
==Formation==
With the rise of Linux during the 1990s, Linux distributions proliferated. Since the Linux kernel and GNU were both free software, anyone could put together and market a distribution. Many industry observers feared fragmentation and wide-ranging incompatibility, similar to the UNIX wars of the early 1990s.

The first moves towards the United Linux project were made at COMDEX in November 1999. There were a number of false starts, but the participants consistently agreed that a unified Linux platform for business made sense. The key factors for success were identified early in 2000.

Starting in March and April 2002, the United Linux board put together a base technical specification, getting input from the four consortium members and their business partners and vendors.

UnitedLinux, LLC was formed May 29, 2002 and the project was announced to the world on May 30, 2002. Two legal agreements were signed by the founding members at this time, the Master Transaction Agreement (MTA) and the Joint Development Contract (JDC); the JDC was also signed by UnitedLinux, LLC. These contracts provided, in part, that intellectual property related to UnitedLinux Software (with certain exceptions) would be assigned to UnitedLinux, LLC. Further, &quot;[e]ach member shall have a broad, royalty-free license to all intellectual property rights in the UnitedLinux Software, entitling each member to &quot;use, copy, modify, distribute, market, advertise, sell, offer for sale, sublicense ... in any manner the Software, including the rights to make derivative works of the Software, to provide access to the Source Code and/or Object Code to any third party, to incorporate the Software into other products or bundle the Software with other products for its own business purposes and any other unlimited right of exploitation&quot;; existing open source licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, also continued to apply. Disputes were to be settled via International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration.

A first beta was released to United Linux member partners on August 14, 2002, a public beta was released on September 25, 2002 and United Linux 1.0 was released on November 19, 2002.

&quot;For a detailed case study in what led one of the four partners to embrace the ideals of United Linux see Caldera OpenLinux.&quot;

==Technical overview==
The distribution was based on SUSE Linux and the Linux Standard Base, with the plan being for SUSE to do most of the engineering work and SCO, Turbolinux and Conectiva primarily to market the distribution in their territories and markets.

It was planned that version 1.0 would take six to eight months to release, be the current version for one year and be supported for another year after the release of 2.0. Minimum technical requirements were:

* Linux kernel 2.4.18 or higher
* GNU C Library 2.2.5
* Linux Standard Base compliant
* OpenI18N (formerly LI18NUX) compliant (internationalization and localization)
* GB 18030 compliant (the standard CJK character encoding used in China)
* GCC 3.1
* XFree86 4.2
* KDE 3.0

==Ending==

On January 20, 2004, SCO filed a lawsuit, against Novell, the then-current owner of SuSE.

The end of United Linux was announced in a Novell press conference on January 22, 2004 by Richard Seibt, president of the SUSE division. The stated reason was that the SCO v. IBM lawsuit and The SCO Group&#x27;s public attacks on Linux had made the alliance unworkable.

It emerged that no real work had been done on United Linux since soon after SCO v. IBM had started, and that SUSE had ceased active participation around this time. The last United Linux announcements were of Oracle Corporation support for it on 13 March 2003, and of AMD64 CPU support on 22 April 2003.

While some have reported that UnitedLinux ended, in fact the group did not gain consensus to dissolve the partnership and the legal entity remains in effect.

The SCO v. Novell complaint was amended on February 3, 2006 to add copyright infringement claims, relating to Novell&#x27;s distribution of SuSE Linux. Novell responded on April 10 by filing a Request for Arbitration with the ICC, and asking that SCO&#x27;s claims be stayed in the district court. They argued in the Request that through the MTA and JDC, &quot;the UnitedLinux members agreed that each member would have an irrevocable, perpetual, and worldwide license to use and unlimitedly exploit any intellectual property rights of the other members in the UnitedLinux Software, which would be transferred to the LLC for this very purpose.&quot; Novell&#x27;s motion to stay was granted in part, for those of SCO&#x27;s claims relating to SuSE.

On September 14, 2007, SCO filed for bankruptcy, and on November 13, the court ruled at SCO&#x27;s request that the arbitration was automatically stayed.

SuSE filed a motion to lift this stay on November 10, 2009. However, SCO objected on December 15, and SUSE&#x27;s motion was denied on January 15, 2010.

<doc id="179842" wikidata="Q596710" url="?curid=179842" title="Xandros">
<text>Xandros, Inc. was a software company which sold Xandros Desktop, a Linux distribution. The name Xandros was derived from the X Window System and the Greek island of Andros.
Xandros was founded in May 2001 by Linux Global Partners (Will Roseman and Dr. Frederick Berenstein). The company was headquartered in New York City with its development office in Ottawa, Canada.

Xandros Desktop was based on Corel Linux, a Debian-based distribution that was acquired along with the development team behind the product from Corel Corporation in August 2001 after Corel decided to exit the Linux distribution market. Xandros was a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium and member of the Interop Vendor Alliance.

In July 2007, Xandros bought Scalix, a Linux-based email and collaboration product, based on HP OpenMail.
In July 2008, Xandros acquired Linspire.

In 2013, Xandros, Inc. changed its name to Bridgeways, Inc., and soon after, the Xandros website was taken offline. (The Xandros website was last updated in November 2009.) As a result, DistroWatch listed Xandros as discontinued.

On 1 January 2018, PC/OpenSystems LLC purchased Xandros and Linspire from Bridgeways, Inc., and resurrected the Xandros branding with Xandros OpenDesktop (a commercial release) and Xandros OpenServer (a free release), based on Ubuntu 20.04. Xandros OpenDesktop would later be rebranded as Xandros Enterprise Desktop, and Xandros OpenServer would be rebranded as Xandros Enterprise Server, and PC/OpenSystems also introduced free versions named Xandros Community Edition (using GNOME) and Xandros Developer Edition (using dwm).

==Products==
Xandros made products for both the consumer and business markets. While the distributions included many packages licensed as free software and open-source, Xandros also included proprietary software developed in-house by the Xandros Corporation.

===Commercial editions===
==== Xandros Desktop Home Edition ====
This edition came with a 30-day trial of Crossover Office. It also included an &quot;Applications CD&quot; which includes extra programs which can be installed via Xandros Networks. As opposed to Home Edition Premium, the Home Edition did not include the photo manager, music manager, security suite, wireless profiles, or the ability to write to NTFS partitions.

==== Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium ====
This edition came with a full version of Crossover Office Standard Edition, and a second CD (the &quot;Applications CD&quot;) which included extra applications which could be installed via Xandros Networks. Despite its name, Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium did not include a Xandros Networks Premium Membership.

Xandros Corporation offered a 30-day trial version of Xandros Home Edition Premium as a free download for evaluation purposes.

==== Xandros Desktop Professional ====
Formerly known as Xandros Desktop Business Edition, this edition was basically the same as Xandros Desktop Home Edition Premium, but it included the ability to authenticate to Windows PDC and Active Directory Domains, used PPTP VPN to connect remotely to the office, and used broadband wireless connectivity with 3G, GSM and UMTS support. Xandros Desktop Professional was officially released on 28 November 2006.

As with Home Edition Premium, Xandros Corporation also offered a 30-day trial version of Xandros Professional.

==== Presto ====
Introduced in 2009, Presto was a lightweight &quot;instant-on&quot; operating system which uses the lightweight Xfce 4.6 desktop environment. Similar to Canonical&#x27;s Wubi installer for Ubuntu, it was installed inside of Microsoft Windows, with Windows XP as the earliest supported version. It also had access to an &quot;application store&quot; based on CNR, which was acquired through Xandros&#x27; acquisition of Linspire in mid-2008.

==== Xandros Moblin ====
In 2009, Xandros announced that it would develop a new netbook operating system based on Moblin v2.

=== Server systems ===
Xandros Desktop Management Server (xDMS) was available. It easily set up repositories as it deploys customized Xandros Desktop configurations across a large organization.

Xandros Server was designed to run on servers. It was officially launched at the 2006 LinuxWorld Conference and Expo in Toronto, on 25 April 2006, and officially released for purchase at the Xandros website on 1 May 2006, at a MSRP of US$450. Xandros Server 2.0 has been released in May 2007.

=== Previous editions ===
Xandros Open Circulation Edition (OCE) was a freely redistributable edition for non-commercial use, with a limited set of additional software. Soon after the 4.0 version was released as a DVD shrinkwrapped with Linux magazines, the torrent was pulled from Xandros&#x27; servers and all references to OCE removed from the Xandros website without explanation. Previous versions of Xandros OCE were generally released about 4 months after the release of the commercial versions.

Xandros Desktop OS Standard Edition was basically the same as the Open Circulation Edition, but it included full-speed CD/DVD burning. This product was replaced by Home Edition.

Xandros Desktop OS Deluxe Edition included an &quot;applications CD&quot; which included extra programs which could be installed via Xandros Networks. This product was replaced by Home Edition Premium.

Xandros Desktop OS Surfside Edition (branded and sold as Xandros SurfSide Linux) was basically the same as Xandros Desktop OS Standard Edition, however the Surfside Edition also included a Plantronics USB headset and 120 minutes of SkypeOut service.

According to DistroWatch, Xandros Desktop is discontinued. DistroWatch made the decision because no new official version or official updates to Xandros Desktop have been released since November 2006.

When Xandros purchased Linspire, they announced plans to retain Freespire as a Debian-based free community distribution and to base future editions of Xandros Desktop Professional – Home Edition and Home Edition Premium were to be discontinued – on Freespire. (This would be similar to the way Novell bases SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop on their free openSUSE and to the way Red Hat bases Red Hat Enterprise Linux on their free Fedora.) However, according to one website, Xandros has discontinued Freespire. In addition, the DistroWatch website has added Freespire to its list of discontinued distributions.

== User interface ==
The Xandros graphical user interface (GUI) used a modified version of KDE, which included replacing Konqueror with its own proprietary file manager called Xandros File Manager. It also used a package manager known as Xandros Networks, which handles installation of software. Installation of Xandros was done by a wizard that asks questions about partitioning and the administrator (root) password.

It was possible to install and use the GNOME and Xfce desktop environments on Xandros.

== BridgeWays for Microsoft Systems Center ==

In June 2007, a &quot;broad collaboration agreement&quot; between Xandros and Microsoft was announced. The agreement included &quot;patent covenants, similar to the agreement that Microsoft reached with Novell.&quot;

In 2009, Xandros BridgeWays released the first of many Management Packs for Systems Center.
The BridgeWays Management Pack Suite of products includes:
*VMware ESX virtualization and HyperV Extensions;
*JBoss, Apache, IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic application development environments;
*Oracle, IBM DB2, MySQL database products;
*Apache web servers and more.

In 2010 BridgeWays is “Extending System Center”, by expanding the scope and market potential for Systems Center, with Windows, Linux, UNIX and VMware application environment monitoring. BridgeWays’ only focus is on building, selling and supporting Management Packs for System Center. See BridgeWays users can now track their alerts through System Center Service Manager 2010

BridgeWays does not compete with Microsoft. This group works closely with the Microsoft System Center R&amp;D, Sales and Marketing teams to maximize value to System Center customers. In addition Xandros Bridgeways System Center resells direct and through its partner network of Distributors, ISVs, and SI MVPs worldwide as a contributing member of the System Center community.

== ASUS Eee PC ==

In a collaboration of ASUS hardware and the Xandros operating system, the first &quot;netbook&quot; came into being. The ASUS Eee PC was available with either Xandros or Windows XP. The installed version of Xandros is tab based, built from scratch using Xlib and the Qt 4.5 toolkit. The full desktop version (or &quot;Advanced Mode&quot;) may be installed—but not always easily—through a set of administrative command prompts. The full desktop version features a KDE 3 desktop with a few modifications performed by Xandros. This desktop mode also provides access to the Synaptic Package Manager which can be used to update and manage the Eee PC&#x27;s software.

In February 2009 it was announced Xandros is porting its Eee PC Linux distribution to 2 ARM processor-based (Freescale i.MX515 &amp; the Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU) platforms for netbooks &amp; other mobile devices.

<text>Bermudo I (also Vermudo or Veremund), called the Deacon or the Monk ( 750 – 797), was the King of Asturias from 788 or 789 until his abdication in 791. He was a son of Fruela of Cantabria, a nephew of Alfonso I, and a brother of Aurelius. The nature of the end of his reign ushered in a new period in Asturian-Arab relations.

Bermudo was elected by the palatine officials (the nobility of the royal palace) to replace Mauregatus, who had died of natural causes in 788. Since Mauregatus had ascended the throne in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; with regional support in 783 and the succession of Bermudo proceeded without incident, it is probable that Mauregatus had procured a change in the ranks of the palatine nobility and that Bermudo was thus put forward as the candidate to, like Mauregatus, prevent the succession of Alfonso II, the son and heir of Fruela I. Though the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot; in both its extant versions makes Bermudo out to be a deacon at his succession, this fact would only reinforce the notion that his election was a determined move to oppose Alfonso.

In any case, he did not reign long. He was forced to defend against an Arab-Berber invasion of Álava and Galicia and was defeated at the Battle of the Burbia River, probably the Bierzo, in 791. Though the closest Christian sources do not name his opponents, the battle can be linked with the first major engagement of a series of aggressive campaigns launched against the Asturian kingdom in the 790s. The Muslim commander at Burbia is named in Ibn al-Athir as Yūsuf ibn Bukht and the battle is likewise recorded in al-Maqqarī. Bermudo abdicated his throne after his defeat, though whether volitionally (as the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot; states, &quot;because he was [or remembered he was] a deacon&quot;) or under duress is unknown. Historically in Spain under the Visigoths, a king of proven military inadequacy was often forced to abdicate. Nevertheless, he was considered a generous and illustrious man in his time, &quot;merciful and pious&quot; in the words of the &quot;Chronicle of Albelda&quot;.

Bermudo was succeeded by Alfonso II and he left behind a son, who later reigned as Ramiro I, by an anonymous wife. He reportedly lived for a long time after his abdication, perhaps as a monk, and on good terms with his successor.

<doc id="179845" wikidata="Q168363" url="?curid=179845" title="Ramiro I of Asturias">
<text>Ramiro I ( – 1 February 850) was king of Asturias from 842 until his death in 850. Son of King Bermudo I, he became king following a succession struggle after his predecessor, Alfonso II, died without children. During his turbulent reign, he fended off attacks from both Vikings and the forces of al-Andalus. Architecturally, his recreational palace Santa María del Naranco and other buildings used the &quot;ramirense&quot; style that prefigured Romanesque architecture.
He was a contemporary of Abd ar-Rahman II, Umayyad Emir of Córdoba.

==Reign==
===Gaining the throne===
The death of King Alfonso II brought about a succession crisis in the Kingdom of Asturias. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;, credited to Ramiro&#x27;s grandson, the childless Alfonso II chose as his successor Ramiro, his distant kinsman and son of Alfonso&#x27;s predecessor Bermudo I. At the time of King Alfonso&#x27;s death, Ramiro was outside of Asturias in Castile (or &quot;Bardulia&quot; according to the &quot;Chronicle of Alfonso III&quot;), where he was attending his own marriage ceremonies.

Nepocian, &quot;comes palatii&quot; and the late king&#x27;s kinsman, challenged Ramiro&#x27;s succession in his absence, being supported by Astures and Vascones who had been loyal to Alfonso II. Ramiro sought support in Galicia, where he formed an army and advanced toward Oviedo. Nepotian awaited Ramiro&#x27;s advance at Cornellana, by the river Narcea where Ramiro defeated him in the Battle of the Bridge of Cornellana. Nepotian fled, but was pursued and captured by Counts Scipion and Sonna. After his capture, Nepotian was blinded and interned in a monastery.

===Fending off Vikings===
By the time of Ramiro&#x27;s reign, Vikings were frequenting the waters of Europe&#x27;s coastal regions. In 844, a fleet disembarked at Corunna and began to raid the countryside, burning and pillaging. Ramiro marched against them with an army of considerable strength and managed to rout the invaders. He took some of them as prisoners and burned a large part of their fleet. Ramiro&#x27;s reception dissuaded the Vikings such that they no longer raided the coastlines of Asturias.

===The legend of the Battle of Clavijo===
According to legend, in 834, Ramiro defeated the Moors in the Battle of Clavijo. The date was later changed to 844 in order to accommodate the contradictions inherent to the story (Ramiro was not ruling in 834). The account of the battle came to the spotlight on a spurious charter forged in Santiago de Compostela in the early 12th century. Neither Asturian nor Arab chronicles of the period make any mention of such a battle. It is first mentioned in the chronicles of Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada, 13th-century archbishop of Toledo.

The account of the battle appears to be a mythification of the historical 859 Second Battle of Albelda, in which Ramiro&#x27;s son and successor, Ordoño I along with García Íñiguez of Pamplona crushed the forces of Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi. According to the legend, during the battle, Saint James the Greater, the Moor-slayer, is said to have appeared riding a white horse and bearing a white standard, and aided Asturian troops to defeat the Moors. This gave rise to the cult of Saint James in Iberia (&quot;see Way of St. James&quot;).

In thanks for the intervention of the Apostle, Ramiro is said to have instituted a forged grant called Voto de Santiago actually dating from the 12th century, a tax for the benefit of the Church that was only repealed by the Cortes of Cádiz in 1812.

===Attempt to repopulate León===
Ramiro&#x27;s most important confrontation with the Muslim kingdoms of Iberia was not a success. Emir Abd ar-Rahman II of Córdoba likewise had to face Viking invaders, as well as internal rebellions led by Musa ibn Musa of the Banu Qasi family. Ramiro took advantage of the temporary respite to repopulate the city of León. This particular attempt at repopulation was short-lived. Abd ar-Rahman II dispatched both the Vikings and the rebels, and in 846 sent an army led by his son (later Muhammad I of Córdoba), forcing the Catholics to again evacuate León, which the Muslims then burned. The city was not reoccupied until 856, under Ordoño I.

===Internal conflict and harsh justice===
While Asturias under Ramiro was relatively free of foreign confrontations, the latter portion of the reign saw much internal conflict. As mentioned above, his ascent to the throne had been problematic, and he continued to encounter discontented and rebellious nobles. The &quot;Chronica Albeldense&quot; makes mention of two of these rebels in particular. After defeating the rebel &quot;prócer&quot; (grandee or high-ranking noble) Piniolo, Ramiro condemned him to death along with his seven sons. The leader of the second rebellion, the &quot;comes palatii&quot; Aldroito, he condemned to be blinded.

Ramiro acted with severity against &quot;latrones&quot; (thieves) whose number nonetheless increased the civil discord of his reign, and against &quot;magos&quot;, presumably the pagans still rooted amongst the more isolated settlements. The &quot;Chronica Albeldense&quot; praises Ramiro as &quot;Uirga iustitiae&quot;, that is, &quot;the Rod of Justice&quot;.

==Marriages, descendants, and succession==
All that is known of Ramiro&#x27;s first marriage is that it must have occurred early enough for his son to have already been an adult at the time of Ramiro&#x27;s succession. Ramiro&#x27;s son Ordoño succeeded his father as king of Asturias upon the former&#x27;s death.

Ramiro contracted his second marriage, to Paterna, around 842, the year of the death of his predecessor Alfonso II. The chronicle of his grandson asserts that when Alfonso II died, Ramiro was in the Castilian lands for his wedding, suggesting that his wife was Castilian. It is presumed that the bride in this marriage was the Paterna who appeared later as his widow.

There is no solid evidence of children other than Ordoño. Traditionally, Count Rodrigo of Castile (died 873) has been named as son of Ramiro and Paterna. The medievalist Justo Pérez de Urbel says that Rodrigo was named count of Castile because of his link to the Asturian royal family, and that it is possible that this link existed through Queen Paterna, but not necessarily through being her son.

Ramiro may have been the father of Gatón, Count of Astorga and of El Bierzo, since the 14th century &quot;Al-Bayan al-Mughrib&quot; of Ibn Idhari, states that Gatón was the &#x27;brother&#x27; of Ordoño I de Asturias.

==Death and burial==
Ramiro died 1 February 850, in his palace at Santa María del Naranco, located on Mount Naranco, near the city of Oviedo. He was buried in the Pantheon of Asturian Kings in the Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo, alongside his second wife, Paterna. His remains were deposited in a stone sepulchre, no longer extant, next to a similar sepulchre for his predecessor, Alfonso II el Casto. His sepulchre was inscribed:
&quot;OBIIT DIVAE MEMORIAE RANIMIRUS REX DIE KAL. FEBRUARII. ERA DCCCLXXXVIII. OBTESTOR VOS OMNES QUI HAEC LECTURI ESTIS. UT PRO REQUIE ILLIUS ORARE NON DESINETIS&quot;.

==The &quot;Ramirense&quot; style in architecture==
The art and architecture of Ramiro&#x27;s reign forms the Pre-Romanesque &quot;Ramirense&quot; phase of Asturian art. His court was the center of great splendor, of which the palace and church of Santa María del Naranco and San Miguel de Lillo are testimony. On the southern slopes of Mount Naranco, near the city of Oviedo, Ramiro I ordered the construction of the palace of Santa María del Naranco and a church known as San Miguel de Lillo or Liño. The church collapsed in the thirteenth century, and today only about a third of the original survives. Related service buildings did not survive even as ruins. Another example of Ramirense architecture is the church of Santa Cristina de Lena, near the municipality of Lena, some from Oviedo. The palace and the two churches have been designated World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

Ramirense architecture introduced barrel vaults made of tufa (a relatively lightweight limestone). These were novel not only with respect to earlier architecture of the region but in terms of the European architecture of the period, including that of Muslim Spain, which used wooden roofs.

<text>Kim Duk-koo (; born Lee Deok-gu, ; July 29, 1955November 18, 1982) was a South Korean boxer who died after fighting in a world championship boxing match against Ray Mancini. His death sparked reforms aimed at better protecting the health of boxers, including reducing the number of rounds in championship bouts from 15 to 12.

==Early life and education==
Kim was born in Gangwon Province, South Korea, 100 miles east of Seoul, the youngest of five children. His father died when he was two and his mother married three more times. Kim grew up poor. He worked odd jobs, such as a shoe shiner and a tour guide, before getting into boxing in 1976.

==Professional career==

After compiling a 29–4 amateur record, he turned professional in 1978. In February 1982, he won the Orient and Pacific Boxing Federation lightweight title and became the World Boxing Association&#x27;s number 1 contender. Kim carried a 17–1–1 professional record into the Mancini fight and had won 8 bouts by KO before flying to Las Vegas as the world&#x27;s (WBA) number 1 challenger to world lightweight champion Mancini. However, he had fought outside of South Korea only once before, in the Philippines. It was his first time ever fighting in North America.

===Mancini match===
Kim was lightly regarded by the US boxing establishment, but not by Ray Mancini, who believed the fight would be a &quot;war&quot;. Kim struggled to lose weight in the days prior to the bout so that he could weigh in under the lightweight&#x27;s 135-pound limit. Before the fight, Kim was quoted as saying &quot;Either he dies, or I die.&quot; He wrote the message &quot;live or die&quot; on his Las Vegas hotel lampshade only days before the bout (a mistaken translation led to &quot;kill or be killed&quot; being reported in the media).

Mancini and Kim met in an arena outside Caesars Palace on November 13, 1982 (the night after Aaron Pryor defeated Alexis Argüello). They went toe to toe for a good portion of the bout, to the point that Mancini briefly considered quitting. Kim tore open Mancini&#x27;s left ear and puffed up his left eye, and Mancini&#x27;s left hand swelled to twice its normal size. After the fight Mancini&#x27;s left eye would be completely closed. However, by the later rounds, Mancini began to dominate, landing many more punches than Kim. In the 11th he buckled Kim&#x27;s knees. In the beginning of the 13th round Mancini charged Kim with a flurry of 39 punches but had little effect. Sugar Ray Leonard (working as one of the commentators of the fight) said Kim came right back very strong. Leonard later declared the round to be closely contested. When the fighters came out for the 14th round, Mancini charged forward and hit Kim with a right. Kim reeled back, Mancini missed with a left, and then Mancini hit Kim with another hard right hand. Kim went flying into the ropes, his head hitting the canvas. Kim managed to rise unsteadily to his feet, but referee Richard Green stopped the fight and Mancini was declared the winner by TKO nineteen seconds into the 14th round. Ralph Wiley of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, covering the fight, would later recall Kim pulling himself up the ropes as he was dying as &quot;one of the greatest physical feats I had ever witnessed&quot;.

Minutes after the fight was over, Kim collapsed into a coma and was removed from the Caesars Palace arena on a stretcher and taken to the Desert Springs Hospital. At the hospital, he was found to have a subdural hematoma consisting of of blood in his skull. Emergency brain surgery was performed at the hospital to try to save him, but Kim died five days after the bout, on November 18 (he was declared legally dead by a Clark County, Nevada judge at 6 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on November 17). The neurosurgeon said it was caused by one punch. The week after, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published a photo of the fight on its cover, under the heading &quot;Tragedy in the Ring&quot;. The profile of the incident was heightened by the fight having been televised live by CBS in the United States.

Kim had never fought a 15-round bout before. In contrast, Mancini was much more experienced at the time. He had fought 15-round bouts three times and gone on to round 14 once before. Kim compiled a record of 17 wins with two losses and one draw. Eight of Kim&#x27;s wins were knockouts.

===Aftermath of Kim&#x27;s death===
Mancini went through a period of reflection, as he blamed himself for Kim&#x27;s death. After friends helped him by telling him that it was just an accident, Mancini went on with his career, though still haunted by Kim&#x27;s death. His promoter, Bob Arum, said Mancini &quot;was never the same&quot; after Kim&#x27;s death. Two years later, Mancini lost his title to Livingstone Bramble.

Four weeks after the fatal fight, the Mike Weaver vs. Michael Dokes fight at the same Caesars Palace venue ended with a technical knockout declared 63 seconds into the fight. Referee Joey Curtis admitted to stopping the fight early under orders of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which required referees to be aware of a fighter&#x27;s health, in light of the ManciniKim fight, and a rematch was ordered.

Kim&#x27;s mother flew from South Korea to Las Vegas to be with her son before the life support equipment was turned off. Three months later, she committed suicide by drinking a bottle of pesticide. The bout&#x27;s referee, Richard Green, committed suicide via self-inflicted gunshot wound on July 1, 1983.

Kim left behind a fiancée, Lee Young-mee, despite rules against South Korean boxers having girlfriends. At the time of Kim&#x27;s death, Lee was pregnant with their son, Kim Chi-wan, who was born in July 1983. Kim Chi-Wan became a dentist. In 2011, Kim Chi-wan and his mother had a meeting with Ray Mancini as part of a documentary on the life of Mancini called &quot;The Good Son&quot;.

===Boxing rule changes===
The Nevada State Athletic Commission proposed a series of rule changes as a result, announcing it before a December 10 match between Michael Dokes and Mike Weaver that would in itself be disputed because of what officials were informed before the fight. The break between rounds was initially proposed to go from 60 to 90 seconds (but it was later rescinded). The standing eight count (which allows a knockdown to be called even if the boxer is not down, but on the verge of being knocked down) was imposed, and new rules regarding suspension of licence were imposed (45 days after a knockout loss).

The World Boxing Council (WBC), whose regional championship Kim held prior to relinquishing it for a WBA championship opportunity, announced during its annual convention of 1982 that many rules concerning fighters&#x27; medical care before fights needed to be changed. One of the most significant was the WBC&#x27;s reduction of title fights from 15 rounds to 12. The World Boxing Association (WBA), which sanctioned the fatal match, and the International Boxing Federation (IBF) followed the WBC in 1987. When the World Boxing Organization (WBO) was formed in 1988, it immediately began operating with 12-round world championship bouts.

In the years after Kim&#x27;s death, new medical procedures were introduced to fighters&#x27; pre-fight checkups, such as electrocardiograms, brain tests, and lung tests. As one boxing leader put it, &quot;A fighter&#x27;s check-ups before fights used to consist of blood pressure and heartbeat checks before 1982. Not anymore.&quot;

<doc id="179847" wikidata="Q343088" url="?curid=179847" title="Magnus II of Norway">
<text>Magnus Haraldsson (Old Norse: &quot;Magnús Haraldsson&quot;; – 28 April 1069) was King of Norway from 1066 to 1069, jointly with his brother Olaf Kyrre from 1067. He was not included in official Norwegian regnal lists until modern times, but has since been counted as Magnus II.

A son of King Harald Hardrada, Magnus was in 1058 appointed nominal leader of an expedition into the Irish Sea while still only a child. He appears to have assisted Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia in their struggles against Wessex, although his primary objective may have been to assert control over Orkney. He later accompanied his father in Harald&#x27;s campaign against Denmark in 1062, and was appointed regent and made king before Harald&#x27;s fatal invasion of England in 1066. Magnus briefly ruled Norway alone thereafter, until his younger brother Olaf returned from England in 1067.

Magnus co-ruled with Olaf following his brother&#x27;s return to Norway, but less than three years into his reign, Magnus became ill and died. His kingship has been downplayed in later history in part due to this. Magnus had only one child, Haakon Toresfostre who was king briefly after Olaf, but who also died young.

==Early life==

===Background===
Magnus was born in 1048 or 1049. He was the first of two sons of King Harald Hardrada, by his consort Tora Torbergsdatter. There are no known skaldic poems written about Magnus, and he appears only briefly in the Norse sagas. The author of &quot;Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum&quot; describes him in passing as &quot;a most handsome man.&quot; While not mentioned anywhere in the sagas, Magnus appears in contemporary British sources around the year 1058 as the leader of a Norwegian expedition in the Irish Sea.

===Expedition to the West===
In 1058, Magnus headed an expedition into the Irish Sea that sought to extend Norwegian authority in the region, the Norwegians siding with a faction that opposed the Norse-Gaelic king Echmarcach mac Ragnaill. The expedition also appears to have supported a branch of the Norse-Gaelic dynasty of Ivar that opposed Irish king Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó. Magnus commanded a fleet that, in addition to Norway, recruited men from Orkney, the Hebrides, and Dublin. His forces were later active in Wales and perhaps in England, and English chronicler John of Worcester associates the Norwegian fleet (along with the Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn), with returning the exiled Ælfgar, Earl of Mercia to power. The Irish &quot;Annals of Tigernach&quot; goes further in claiming that Magnus&#x27;s goal was to seize power in England, but this is not supported by Welsh and English sources which also includes the &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; and the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;.

Magnus&#x27;s campaign may have been part of his father&#x27;s plans for an invasion of England, as control over the Kingdom of the Isles would have provided him with more troops. Historian Kelly DeVries has moreover proposed that Harald may have wanted to test the situation in England before a possible invasion, only to find that he could not be at war with Denmark and England at the same time. The expedition of Magnus never made significant landfall in England, but for English king Edward the Confessor it probably signalled renewed Norwegian ambitions from Harald Hardrada, who considered himself Edward&#x27;s rightful heir. At the same time, the rise in power of Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his sons, in particular Harold Godwinson, had also started representing a threat to Harald&#x27;s claim.

On the other hand, historian Alex Woolf has suggested that the expedition originally may only have been intended for Orkney, and that in search for plunder it was followed by an expedition into the Irish Sea that by mere luck presented Magnus with the opportunity of raiding with Earl Ælfgar. The exact year that Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney died is not recorded anywhere, other than that it is stated in the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; that it was in the later days of Harald Hardrada. Thus, it may be that his death provoked Magnus&#x27;s expedition, and that the expedition was the occasion on which Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson, Thorfinn&#x27;s successors as earls, submitted to Harald. Woolf has also proposed that Magnus may have played some part in the war in Scotland in 1057–1058, perhaps supporting Máel Coluim mac Donnchada against Lulach.

==Kingship and death==

Magnus accompanied his father in Harald&#x27;s campaign against Denmark in 1062. On his way to Denmark, Harald&#x27;s fleet clashed with the fleet of Danish king Sweyn Estridsson in a major naval battle at Niså that resulted in Norwegian victory. In 1066, after concluding peace with Sweyn Estridsson, Harald set out on his campaign of conquering England from Harold Godwinson. Before departing, he appointed Magnus as regent and king of Norway in his absence, and had his younger son Olaf accompany him on the expedition. After initial success in the Battle of Fulford, Harald was defeated and killed by Harold Godwinson in the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Olaf survived and returned to Norway with the remaining troops in early 1067, and was proclaimed king and co-ruler with his brother Magnus.

Although it was intended for Magnus and Olaf to rule the kingdom jointly without division, in practice Olaf ruled over Viken (the south-eastern part of Norway), while Magnus controlled the Uplands and Trøndelag (the middle parts of Norway) along with Western Norway and Northern Norway. Despite this division, there are no signs of hostility between the brothers, and their relationship appears to have been peaceful.

Having reigned for less than three years, Magnus became ill and died in Nidaros (Trondheim) on 28 April 1069. The sagas posit that Magnus died of ringworm, but modern scholars have proposed that he instead may have died of ergotism (poisoning by the &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; fungus). Snorri Sturluson writes briefly in the &quot;Saga of Harald Hardrade&quot; that Magnus was &quot;an amiable king and bewailed by the people.&quot;

Magnus&#x27;s kingship has been downplayed in later history partly due to his short tenure, and because most of it was together with his brother. The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow Magnus&#x27;s reign, combined with the fact that the later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended (or claimed descent) from Olaf.

The king known today as Magnus VI (the first Norwegian king known to use regnal numbers) originally used the regnal number IV for himself in contemporary Latin letters, leaving out Magnus Haraldsson. As the numbering system has seen changes in modern times, Magnus Haraldsson is today included as Magnus II.

==Family==
Magnus had a son, Haakon Magnusson of Norway, who was probably born the same year that Magnus died. Haakon went on to claim what he considered his part of the kingdom (after his father) in 1093 when his uncle Olaf Kyrre died, and shared the kingdom with his cousin Magnus Barefoot (son of Olaf Kyrre). Similar to the reign of his father, Haakon&#x27;s reign also ended abruptly after a short time as he died young in 1095.

<text>Haakon Magnusson (: ; 1068 – February 1095), byname Toresfostre (, meaning &quot;fostered by Tore&quot;), was King of Norway from 1093 to 1095. Haakon was only partially recognized within Norway and his reign was thus of limited significance. He has generally not been counted in the numbered series of Norwegian kings.

==Life==
He was the grandson of King Harald Hardrada, son of King Magnus and nephew of King Olaf Kyrre. Haakon was born around the same time his father died. He was raised as a foster son by Tore på Steig of Gudbrandsdalen on the farm Steig in Fron. In 1090, he undertook a Viking expedition to Bjarmaland, today the area of Arkhangelsk in northern Russia.

After the death of Olav Kyrre he was hailed as King of Norway in Trondheim, while his cousin, King Magnus Barefoot, was hailed in Viken. He soon came into conflict with King Magnus and war seemed inevitable. In 1095, Magnus Berrføtt prepared an armed action against Haakon, but was surprised by the strong position held by his cousin. When Haakon learned that Magnus had come to Trondheim, he went across the Dovrefjell mountain range. However, Haakon suddenly died during the trip over Dovrefjell. Magnus subsequently ruled as sole king of Norway. He captured Tore på Steig who was subsequently hanged. He was buried in Christ Church in Trondheim.

<text>WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is a set of extensions to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which allows user agents to collaboratively author contents &quot;directly&quot; in an HTTP web server by providing facilities for concurrency control and namespace operations, thus allowing the Web to be viewed as a &quot;writeable, collaborative medium&quot; and not just a read-only medium. WebDAV is defined in by a working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The WebDAV protocol provides a framework for users to create, change and move documents on a server. The most important features include the maintenance of properties about an author or modification date, namespace management, collections, and overwrite protection. Maintenance of properties includes such things as the creation, removal, and querying of file information. Namespace management deals with the ability to copy and move web pages within a server&#x27;s namespace. Collections deal with the creation, removal, and listing of various resources. Lastly, overwrite protection handles aspects related to the locking of files. It takes advantage of existing technologies such as Transport Layer Security, digest access authentication or XML to satisfy those requirements.

Many modern operating systems provide built-in client-side support for WebDAV.

== History ==
WebDAV began in 1996 when Jim Whitehead worked with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to host two meetings to discuss the problem of distributed authoring on the World Wide Web with interested people. Tim Berners-Lee&#x27;s original vision of the Web involved a medium for both reading and writing. In fact, Berners-Lee&#x27;s first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, could both view and edit web pages; but, as the Web grew, it became a read-only medium for most users. Whitehead and other like-minded people wanted to transcend that limitation.

The meetings resulted in the formation of an IETF working group because the new effort would lead to extensions to HTTP, which the IETF had started to standardize.

As work began on the protocol, it became clear that handling both distributed authoring and versioning together would involve too much work and that the tasks would have to be separated. The WebDAV group focused on distributed authoring, and left versioning for the future. (The Delta-V extension added versioning later see the Extensions section below.)

The WebDAV working group concluded its work in March 2007, after the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG) accepted an incremental update to . Other extensions left unfinished at that time, such as the BIND method, have been finished by their individual authors, independent of the formal working group.

== Implementation ==

WebDAV extends the set of standard HTTP verbs and headers allowed for request methods. The added verbs include:


=== Properties ===
The properties of WebDAV protocol are name–value pair, in which a &quot;name&quot; is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the &quot;values&quot; are expressed through XML elements. Furthermore, the methods to handle the properties are PROPFIND and PROPPATCH.

== Documents produced by the working group ==
The WebDAV working group produced several works:

* a requirements document: &quot;Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web&quot; , issued February 1998
* a base protocol document (excluding versioning, despite its title): &quot;HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)&quot; , issued June 2007 (which updates and supersedes &quot;HTTP Extensions for Distributed Authoring WebDAV&quot; , issued February 1999)
* the ordered collections protocol: &quot;Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Ordered Collections Protocol&quot; , issued December 2003
* the access control protocol: &quot;Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Access Control Protocol&quot; , issued May 2004
* a quota specification: &quot;Quota and Size Properties for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV) Collections&quot; , issued February 2006
* a redirect specification: &quot;Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Redirect Reference Resources&quot; , issued March 2006

== Other documents published through IETF ==
* the versioning protocol: &quot;Versioning Extensions to WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning)&quot; (created by the Delta-V working group)
* a specification of WebDAV property datatypes: &quot;Datatypes for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Properties&quot; 
* a document defining how to initiate mounting of a WebDAV resource: &quot;Mounting Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Servers&quot; 
* a calendar access protocol: &quot;Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)&quot; 
* a query protocol: &quot;Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) SEARCH&quot; 
* an extension to the WebDAV ACL specification: &quot;WebDAV Current Principal Extension&quot; 
* an extension to the WebDAV MKCOL method: &quot;Extended MKCOL for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)&quot; 
* an extension of the collection model, defining creation and discovery of additional bindings to a resource: &quot;Binding Extensions to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)&quot; 
* an application of POST to WebDAV collections: &quot;Using POST to Add Members to Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Collections&quot; 
* an extension which allows synchronizing large collections efficiently: &quot;Collection Synchronization for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)&quot; 

== Extensions and derivatives ==
For versioning, the Delta-V protocol under the Web Versioning and Configuration Management working group adds resource revision tracking, published in .

For searching and locating, the DAV Searching and Locating (DASL) working group never produced any official standard although there are a number of implementations of its last draft. Work continued as non-working-group activity. The WebDAV Search specification attempts to pick up where the working group left off, and was published as in November 2008.

For calendaring, CalDAV is a protocol allowing calendar access via WebDAV. CalDAV models calendar events as HTTP resources in iCalendar format, and models calendars containing events as WebDAV collections.

For groupware, GroupDAV is a variant of WebDAV which allows client/server groupware systems to store and fetch objects such as calendar items and address book entries instead of web pages.

For MS Exchange interoperability, WebDAV can be used for reading/updating/deleting items in a mailbox or public folder. WebDAV for Exchange has been extended by Microsoft to accommodate working with messaging data. Exchange Server version 2000, 2003, and 2007 support WebDAV. However, WebDAV support has been discontinued in Exchange 2010 in favor of Exchange Web Services (EWS), a SOAP/XML based API.

=== Additional Windows-specific extensions ===

As part of the Windows Server Protocols (WSPP) documentation set, Microsoft published the following protocol documents detailing extensions to WebDAV:

* [MS-WDVME]: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Protocol: Microsoft Extensions. These extensions include a new verb and new headers, and properties that enable previously unmanageable file types and optimize protocol interactions for file system clients. These extensions introduce new functionality into WebDAV, optimize processing, and eliminate the need for special-case processing.
* [MS-WDV]: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Protocol: Client Extensions. The client extensions in this specification extend the WebDAV Protocol by introducing new headers that both enable the file types that are not currently manageable and optimize protocol interactions for file system clients. These extensions do not introduce new functionality into the WebDAV Protocol, but instead optimize processing and eliminate the need for special-case processing.
* [MS-WDVSE]: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) Protocol: Server Extensions. The server extensions in this specification extend WebDAV by introducing new HTTP request and response headers that both enable the file types that are not currently manageable and optimize protocol interactions for file system clients. This specification also introduces a new WebDAV method that is used to send search queries to disparate search providers.
* [MS-WEBDAVE]: Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning Error Extensions Protocol Specification. This SharePoint Front-End Protocol describes extended error codes and extended error handling mechanism specified in [MS-WDV] to enable compliant servers to report error condition details on a server response.

== WebDAV clients ==

== WebDAV libraries ==

== Alternatives to WebDAV ==
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP), a simple and widely adopted network protocol based on IP, allows users to transfer files between network hosts. FTPS extends FTP for secure traffic.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), an extension of the Secure Shell protocol (SSH) version 2.0, provides secure file-transfer capability; and scp, a form of SFTP that runs as a single command similar to a regular cp (copy) command in the shell.
* Rsync, a protocol and a command similar to scp, that can also skip rewriting identical files and portions of files, or skip newer files, etc.
* A distributed file system such as the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol allows Microsoft Windows and open-source Samba clients to access and manage files and folders remotely on a suitable file server. Commonly used for multimedia streaming over Ethernet and widely supported by Smart TVs.
* AtomPub, an HTTP-based protocol for creating and updating web resources, can be used for some of the use cases of WebDAV. It is based on standard HTTP verbs with standardized collection resources that behave somewhat like the WebDAV model of directories.
* CMIS, a standard consisting of a set of Web services for sharing information among disparate content repositories, seeks to ensure interoperability for people and applications using multiple content repositories; it has both SOAP- and AtomPub-based interfaces
* Wiki software, such as MediaWiki.
* Linked Data Platform (LDP), a Linked Data specification defining a set of integration patterns for building RESTful HTTP services that are capable of read-write of RDF data.
* Object storage such as OpenStack Swift or Amazon S3

<doc id="179850" wikidata="Q223646" url="?curid=179850" title="Ordoño I of Asturias">
<text>Ordoño I ( – 27 May 866) was King of Asturias from 850 until his death. He was born in Oviedo, where he spent his early life in the court of Alfonso II. He was probably raised in Lugo, capital of the province of Galicia, where his father, Ramiro I, had been named governor. He received his education and military training there.

Ordoño was named governor of Galicia when his father went to Bardulia to marry his second wife, Paterna. While Ramiro was away, Alfonso II died, and the nobles elected Count Nepocian as king. Ordoño immediately began to raise an army to assist his father, in claiming the throne. He could not leave his post in Galicia to help, however, and his army went unused. When his father finally prevailed, he confirmed Ordoño in his heretofore provisional position. After his father&#x27;s death in 850, Ordoño succeeded his father as king, becoming the first king of Asturias to ascend the throne without election. His first confrontation was with the Basques, who rebelled with the support of the Banu Qasi of Zaragoza. While returning to Oviedo after defeating the rebels, he received news of an impending Moorish assault on Bardulia. Before the Moors could attack, he met them near the Ebro and defeated them. 

Ordoño later went to war against Musa ibn Musa, a Muslim Goth who had been consolidating his power and controlled Zaragoza, Albelda, Tudela, Huesca, and Toledo. According to the Chronicle of Alfonso III, Musa had placed his army at Monte Laturce, outside of Albelda, which he had recently fortified. Ordoño split his own army into two, with one half to siege Albelda and the other to combat Musa&#x27;s forces. The result of the ensuing battle was a massacre; it was claimed that Musa&#x27;s brother-in-law Garcia and over 10,000 of Musa&#x27;s cavalrymen were killed, and Musa fled after nearly being killed himself. Musa&#x27;s son, referred to as Lupo, supposedly subjugated himself to Ordoño upon learning of the result of the battle; he remained Ordoño&#x27;s vassal for the rest of his life and fought alongside him against other Moors. Separately, he also defeated and imprisoned Moneror (also called Mazaros), king of Talamanca, as well as Zeth, king of Coria. He sacked both villages and took their inhabitants as slaves.

Ordoño additionally led the repopulation of the cities of Tui, Astorga, León, and Amaya, which had been left deserted after being conquered by Alfonso II. He died in Oviedo in 866 after suffering from gout, and was buried in the Cathedral of San Salvador. He was described as a beloved king. He was succeeded by his son, Alfonso III, who would eventually be referred to as the first &quot;Emperor of Spain.&quot;

<text>Favila or Fafila (died 739) was the second King of Asturias from 737 until his death. He was the only son and successor of Pelagius, the first Asturian monarch.

In 737 he founded the Church of Santa Cruz, in his capital of Cangas de Onís, but aside from this, nothing else about his reign is known.

Favila was killed by a bear while on a hunt in 739. As a result, Asturian chroniclers were critical of him for his excessive levity. However, royal hunts were not just for entertainment, they helped foster political unity within the court.

Favila was buried with his wife Froiluba in the Church of Santa Cruz de Cangas de Onís.

He was succeeded by his brother-in-law Alfonso, husband of his sister Ermesinda.

The family rose to prominence with Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), a court factor to the German Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel in the Free City of Frankfurt, Holy Roman Empire, who established his banking business in the 1760s. Unlike most previous court factors, Rothschild managed to bequeath his wealth and established an international banking family through his five sons, who established businesses in Paris, Frankfurt, London, Vienna, and Naples. The family was elevated to noble rank in the Holy Roman Empire and the United Kingdom.

During the 19th century, the Rothschild family possessed the largest private fortune in the world, as well as in modern world history. The family&#x27;s wealth declined over the 20th century, and was divided among many descendants. Today, their interests cover a diverse range of fields, including financial services, real estate, mining, energy, agriculture, winemaking, and nonprofits. Many examples of the family&#x27;s rural architecture exist across northwestern Europe. The Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories, many of which have antisemitic origins.

==Overview==

The first member of the family who was known to use the name &quot;Rothschild&quot; was Isaak Elchanan Rothschild, born in 1577. The name is derived from the German &quot;zum rothen Schild&quot; (with the old spelling &quot;th&quot;), meaning &quot;at the red shield&quot;, in reference to the house where the family lived for many generations (in those days, houses were designated not by numbers, but by signs displaying different symbols or colours). A red shield can still be seen at the centre of the Rothschild coat of arms. The family&#x27;s ascent to international prominence began in 1744, with the birth of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. He was the son of Amschel Moses Rothschild (born circa 1710), a money changer who had traded with the Prince of Hesse. Born in the &quot;Judengasse&quot;, the ghetto of Frankfurt, Mayer developed a finance house and spread his empire by installing each of his five sons in the five main European financial centres to conduct business. The Rothschild coat of arms contains a clenched fist with five arrows symbolising the five dynasties established by the five sons of Mayer Rothschild, in a reference to Psalm 127: &quot;Like arrows in the hands of a warrior, so are the children of one&#x27;s youth.&quot; The family motto appears below the shield: &quot;Concordia, Integritas, Industria&quot; (Unity, Integrity, Industry).


Paul Johnson writes &quot;[T]he Rothschilds are elusive. There is no book about them that is both revealing and accurate. Libraries of nonsense have been written about them... A woman who planned to write a book entitled &quot;Lies about the Rothschilds&quot; abandoned it, saying: &#x27;It was relatively easy to spot the lies, but it proved impossible to find out the truth.&#x27;&quot; Johnson writes that, unlike the court factors of earlier centuries, who had financed and managed European noble houses, but often lost their wealth through violence or expropriation, the new kind of international bank created by the Rothschilds was impervious to local attacks. Their assets were held in financial instruments, circulating through the world as stocks, bonds and debts. Changes made by the Rothschilds allowed them to insulate their property from local violence: &quot;Henceforth their real wealth was beyond the reach of the mob, almost beyond the reach of greedy monarchs.&quot; Johnson argued that their fortune was generated to the greatest extent by Nathan Mayer Rothschild in London; however, more recent research by Niall Ferguson indicates that greater and equal profits also were realised by the other Rothschild dynasties, including James Mayer de Rothschild in Paris, Carl Mayer von Rothschild in Naples and Amschel Mayer Rothschild in Frankfurt.

Another essential part of Mayer Rothschild&#x27;s strategy for success was to keep control of their banks in family hands, allowing them to maintain full secrecy about the size of their fortunes. In about 1906, the Jewish Encyclopedia noted: &quot;The practice initiated by the Rothschilds of having several brothers of a firm establish branches in the different financial centres was followed by other Jewish financiers, like the Bischoffsheims, Pereires, Seligmans, Lazards and others, and these financiers by their integrity and financial skill obtained credit not alone with their Jewish confrères, but with the banking fraternity in general. By this means, Jewish financiers obtained an increasing share of international finance during the middle and last quarter of the 19th century. The head of the whole group was the Rothschild family...&quot; It also says: &quot;Of more recent years, non-Jewish financiers have learned the same cosmopolitan method, and, on the whole, the control is now rather less than more in Jewish hands than formerly.&quot;
Mayer Rothschild successfully kept the fortune in the family with carefully arranged marriages, often between first- or second-cousins (similar to royal intermarriage). By the late 19th century, however, almost all Rothschilds had started to marry outside the family, usually into the aristocracy or other financial dynasties.
His sons were:
* Amschel Mayer Rothschild (1773–1855): Frankfurt, died childless so his fortune passed to the sons of Salomon and Kalman
* Salomon Mayer Rothschild (1774–1855): Vienna
* Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836): London
* Kalman Mayer Rothschild (1788–1855): Naples
* Jakob Mayer Rothschild (1792–1868): Paris

The German family name &quot;Rothschild&quot; is pronounced in German, unlike in English. The surname &quot;Rothschild&quot; is rare in Germany.

Families by country:
* Rothschild banking family of Austria
* Rothschild banking family of England
* Rothschild banking family of Naples
* Rothschild banking family of France

The five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the Austrian nobility by Emperor Francis I of Austria, and they were all granted the Austrian hereditary title of &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron) on 29 September 1822. The British branch of the family was elevated by Queen Victoria, who granted the hereditary title of baronet (1847) and later the hereditary peerage title of Baron Rothschild (1885).

== Napoleonic Wars ==
The Rothschilds already possessed a significant fortune before the start of the Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815), and the family had gained preeminence in the bullion trade by this time. From London in 1813 to 1815, Nathan Mayer Rothschild was instrumental in almost single-handedly financing the British war effort, organising the shipment of bullion to the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s armies across Europe, as well as arranging the payment of British financial subsidies to their continental allies. In 1815 alone, the Rothschilds provided £9.8 million (equivalent to about £ million in ) in subsidy loans to Britain&#x27;s continental allies.
The brothers helped coordinate Rothschild activities across the continent, and the family developed a network of agents, shippers and couriers to transport gold across war-torn Europe. The family network was also to provide Nathan Rothschild time and again with political and financial information ahead of his peers, giving him an advantage in the markets and rendering the house of Rothschild still more invaluable to the British government.

In one instance, the family network enabled Nathan to receive in London the news of Wellington&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Waterloo a full day ahead of the government&#x27;s official messengers. Rothschild&#x27;s first concern on this occasion was not to the potential financial advantage on the market which the knowledge would have given him; he and his courier immediately took the news to the government. That he used the news for financial advantage was a fiction then repeated in later popular accounts, such as that of Morton. The basis for the Rothschilds&#x27; most famously profitable move was made after the news of British victory had been made public. Nathan Rothschild calculated that the future reduction in government borrowing brought about by the peace would create a bounce in British government bonds after a two-year stabilisation, which would finalise the post-war restructuring of the domestic economy. In what has been described as one of the most audacious moves in financial history, Nathan immediately bought up the government bond market, for what at the time seemed an excessively high price, before waiting two years, then selling the bonds on the crest of a short bounce in the market in 1817 for a 40% profit. Given the sheer power of leverage the Rothschild family had at their disposal, this profit was an enormous sum.

Nathan Mayer Rothschild started his business in Manchester in 1806 and gradually moved it to London, where in 1809 he acquired the location at 2 New Court in St. Swithin&#x27;s Lane, City of London, where it operates today; he established N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in 1811. In 1818, he arranged a £5 million (equal to £ million in ) loan to the Prussian government, and the issuing of bonds for government loans formed a mainstay of his bank&#x27;s business. He gained a position of such power in the City of London that by 1825–26 he was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a market liquidity crisis.

== International high finance ==

Rothschild family banking businesses pioneered international high finance during the industrialisation of Europe and were instrumental in supporting railway systems across the world and in complex government financing for projects such as the Suez Canal. From 1895 through 1907 they loaned nearly $450,000,000 () to European governments. During the 19th century, the family bought up a large proportion of the property in Mayfair, London.

The Rothschild family was directly involved in the independence of Brazil from Portugal in the early 19th century. Upon an agreement, the Brazilian government should pay a compensation of two million pounds sterling to the Kingdom of Portugal to accept Brazil&#x27;s independence. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons was pre-eminent in raising this capital for the government of the newly formed Empire of Brazil on the London market. In 1825, Nathan Rothschild raised £2,000,000, and indeed was probably discreetly involved in the earlier tranche of this loan which raised £1,000,000 in 1824. Part of the price of Portuguese recognition of Brazilian independence, secured in 1825, was that Brazil should take over repayment of the principal and interest on a £1,500,000 loan made to the Portuguese government in 1823 by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons. A correspondence from Samuel Phillips &amp; Co. in 1824 suggests the close involvement of the Rothschilds in the occasion.

Major 19th-century businesses founded with Rothschild family capital include:
* Alliance Assurance (1824) (now Royal &amp; Sun Alliance)
* Chemin de Fer du Nord (1845)
* The Rio Tinto mining company (1873) (from the 1880s onwards, the Rothschilds had full control of Rio Tinto)
* Eramet (1880)
* Imerys (1880)
* De Beers (1888)

The family funded Cecil Rhodes in the creation of the African colony of Rhodesia. From the late 1880s onwards, the family took over control of the Rio Tinto mining company.

The Japanese government approached the London and Paris families for funding during the Russo-Japanese War. The London consortium&#x27;s issue of Japanese war bonds would total £11.5 million (at 1907 currency rates; £ in 2012 currency terms).

The name of Rothschild became synonymous with extravagance and great wealth; and the family was renowned for its art collecting, for its palaces, as well as for its philanthropy. By the end of the century, the family owned, or had built, at the lowest estimates, 41 palaces, of a scale and luxury perhaps unparalleled even by the richest royal families. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George claimed, in 1909, that Nathan, Lord Rothschild was the most powerful man in Britain.

&quot;Niles&#x27; Weekly Register&quot;, Volume 49 had the following to say about the Rothschilds&#x27; influence on international high finance in 1836:

==Changes to family fortunes==
The Neapolitan Rothschilds was the first branch of the family to decline when revolution broke out and Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Naples on 7 September 1860 and set up a provisional Italian government. Because of the family&#x27;s close political connections with Austria and France, was caught in a delicate position. He chose to take temporary sanctuary in Gaeta with the last Neapolitan king, Francis II of the Two Sicilies. However, the Rothschild branches in London, Paris, and Vienna were not prepared nor willing to financially support the deposed king. With the ensuing unification of Italy, and the mounting tension between Adolph and the rest of the family, the Naples house closed in 1863 after forty-two years in business.

In 1901, the German branch closed its doors after more than a century in business following the death of Wilhelm Rothschild with no male heirs. It was not until 1989 that the family returned to Germany, when N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, the British branch, plus Bank Rothschild AG, the Swiss branch, set up a representative banking office in Frankfurt.

By the start of the 20th century, the introduction of national taxation systems had ended the Rothschilds&#x27; policy of operating with a single set of commercial account records, which resulted in the various branches gradually going their own separate ways as independent banks. The system of the five brothers and their successor sons all but disappeared by World War I.

The rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s led to a precarious situation for the Austrian Rothschilds under the annexation of Austria in 1938 when the family was pressured to sell its banking operation at a fraction of its real worth. While other Rothschilds had escaped the Nazis, Louis Rothschild was imprisoned for a year and only released after a substantial ransom was paid by his family. After Louis was allowed to leave the country in March 1939, the Nazis placed the firm of S M von Rothschild under compulsory administration. Nazi officers and senior staff from Austrian museums also emptied the Rothschild family estates of all their valuables. Following the war, the Austrian Rothschilds were unable to reclaim much of their former assets and properties.

Later, the fall of France during the Second World War led to the seizure of the property of the French Rothschilds under German occupation. Despite having their bank restored to them at the end of the war, the French Rothschilds were powerless in 1982 as the family business was nationalised by the socialist government of newly elected President François Mitterrand.

In addition, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the Rothschilds &quot;grossly misjudged the opportunities directly across the Atlantic&quot; and quoted Evelyn de Rothschild as saying that despite the accomplishments made by the various branches of the family in international high finance for over 200 years, &quot;we never seized the initiative in America and that was one of the mistakes my family made.&quot;

==Hereditary titles==
In 1816, four of the five sons of Mayer Amschel Rothschild were elevated to the Austrian nobility by Emperor Francis I of Austria. The remaining son, Nathan, was elevated in 1818. All of them were granted the Austrian hereditary title of &quot;Freiherr&quot; (baron) on 29 September 1822. As a result, some members of the family used the nobiliary particle &quot;de&quot; or &quot;von&quot; before their surname to acknowledge the grant of nobility.

In 1847, Anthony de Rothschild was made a hereditary baronet of the United Kingdom. In 1885, Sir Nathan Rothschild, 2nd Baronet, was granted the hereditary peerage title of Baron Rothschild in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title is currently held by the 5th Baron Rothschild.

== Branches ==
=== English branch ===

The Rothschild banking family of England was founded in 1798 by Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836), who first settled in Manchester but then moved to London. Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son of Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744–1812), first established a textile jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish N M Rothschild &amp; Sons bank in London.

During the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild family&#x27;s London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the Napoleonic Wars. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain, therefore funding the war. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank&#x27;s business for the better part of the century. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons&#x27; financial strength in the City of London became such that, by 1825–26, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a liquidity crisis.
Nathan Mayer&#x27;s eldest son, Lionel de Rothschild (1808–1879), succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel, the bank financed the British government&#x27;s 1875 purchase of Egypt&#x27;s interest in the Suez Canal. The Rothschild bank also funded Cecil Rhodes in the development of the British South Africa Company. Leopold de Rothschild (1845–1917) administered Rhodes&#x27;s estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the Rhodes Scholarship scheme at the University of Oxford. In 1873, de Rothschild Frères in France and N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government&#x27;s money-losing Rio Tinto copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and British Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa, becoming its largest shareholders.

The London banking house continued under the management of Lionel Nathan de Rothschild (1882–1942) and his brother Anthony Gustav de Rothschild (1887–1961), and then to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (1931–2022). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn&#x27;s retirement as head of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of London, the British and French financial firms merged under the leadership of David René de Rothschild.

=== French branches ===
There are two branches of the family connected to France.

The first was the branch of James Mayer de Rothschild (1792–1868), known as &quot;James&quot;, who established de Rothschild Frères in Paris; he married his niece Betty von Rothschild. Following the Napoleonic Wars, he played a major role in financing the construction of railways and the mining business that helped make France an industrial power. By 1980, the Paris business employed about 2,000 people and had an annual turnover of 26 billion francs (€4.13 billion or $5 billion in the currency rates of 1980).
However, the Paris business suffered a near death blow in 1982, when the socialist government of François Mitterrand nationalised and renamed it as Compagnie Européenne de Banque. Baron David de Rothschild, then 39, decided to stay and rebuild, creating a new entity named Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque, with just three employees and €830,000 (US$1 million) in capital. Today, the Paris operation has 22 partners and accounts for a significant part of the global business.

Ensuing generations of the Paris Rothschild family remained involved in the family business, becoming a major force in international investment banking. The Paris Rothschilds have since led the Thomson Financial League Tables in Investment Banking Merger and Acquisition deals in the UK, France and Italy.
James Mayer de Rothschild&#x27;s other son, Edmond James de Rothschild (1845–1934), was very much engaged in philanthropy and the arts, and he was a leading proponent of Zionism. His grandson, Baron Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild, founded in 1953 the LCF Rothschild Group, a private bank. Since 1997, Baron Benjamin de Rothschild chairs the group. The group has €100bn of assets in 2008 and owns many wine properties in France (Château Clarke, Château des Laurets), in Australia, or in South Africa. In 1961, the 35-year-old Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild purchased the company Club Med, after he had visited a resort and enjoyed his stay. His interest in Club Med was sold off by the 1990s. In 1973, he bought out the Bank of California, selling his interests in 1984 before it was sold to Mitsubishi Bank in 1985.

The second French branch was founded by Nathaniel de Rothschild (1812–1870). Born in London, he was the fourth child of the founder of the British branch of the family, Nathan Mayer Rothschild (1777–1836). In 1850, Nathaniel Rothschild moved to Paris to work with his uncle James Mayer Rothschild. In 1853, Nathaniel acquired Château Brane Mouton, a vineyard in Pauillac in the Gironde &quot;département&quot;. Nathaniel Rothschild renamed the estate Château Mouton Rothschild, and it would become one of the best known labels in the world. In 1868, Nathaniel&#x27;s uncle, James Mayer de Rothschild, acquired the neighbouring Château Lafite vineyard.

=== Austrian branch ===
In Vienna, Salomon Mayer Rothschild established a bank in the 1820s and the Austrian family had vast wealth and position. The crash of 1929 brought problems, and Baron Louis von Schwartz Rothschild attempted to shore up the Creditanstalt, Austria&#x27;s largest bank, to prevent its collapse. Nevertheless, during the Second World War they had to surrender their bank to the Nazis and flee the country. Their Rothschild palaces, a collection of vast palaces in Vienna built and owned by the family, were confiscated, plundered and destroyed by the Nazis. The palaces were famous for their sheer size and for their huge collections of paintings, armour, tapestries and statues (some of which were restored to the Rothschilds by the Austrian government in 1999).

All family members escaped the Holocaust, some of them moving to the United States, and returning to Europe only after the war. In 1999, the government of Austria agreed to return to the Rothschild family some 250 art treasures looted by the Nazis and absorbed into state museums after the war.

=== Neapolitan branch ===
The C M de Rothschild &amp; Figli bank arranged substantial loans to the Papal States and to various Kings of Naples plus the Duchy of Parma and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. However, in the 1830s, Naples followed Spain with a gradual shift away from conventional bond issues that began to affect the bank&#x27;s growth and profitability. The Unification of Italy in 1861, with the ensuing decline of the Italian aristocracy who had been the Rothschilds&#x27; primary clients, eventually brought about the closure of their Naples bank, due to a forecasted decline in the sustainability of the business over the long-term. However, in the early 19th century, the Rothschild family of Naples built up close relations with the Holy See, and the association between the family and the Vatican continued into the 20th century.

In 1832, when Pope Gregory XVI was seen meeting Carl von Rothschild to arrange the 1832 Rothschild loan to the Holy See (for £400,000, worth €43,000,000 in 2014), observers were shocked that Rothschild was not required to kiss the Pope&#x27;s feet, as was then required for all other visitors to the Pope, including monarchs. The 1906 &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; described the Rothschilds as &quot;the guardians of the papal treasure&quot;.

== Jewish identity and positions on Zionism ==
Jewish solidarity in the family was not homogeneous. Many Rothschilds were supporters of Zionism, while other members of the family opposed the creation of the Jewish state. In 1917 Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild was the addressee of the Balfour Declaration to the Zionist Federation, which committed the British government to the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. His nephew, Victor, Lord Rothschild was against granting asylum or helping Jewish refugees in 1938.

After the death of James Jacob de Rothschild in 1868, his eldest son Alphonse Rothschild took over the management of the family bank and was the most active in support for Eretz Israel. The Rothschild family archives show that during the 1870s the family contributed nearly 500,000 francs per year on behalf of Eastern Jewry to the Alliance Israélite Universelle.

Baron Edmond James de Rothschild (known in Israel simply as &quot;the Baron Rothschild&quot; or &quot;the Benefactor&quot; (Hebrew: &quot;HaNadiv&quot;)), youngest son of James Jacob de Rothschild, was a patron of the first permanent settlement in Palestine at Rishon-LeZion (1882). He also provided funding for the establishment of Petah Tikva as a permanent settlement (1883). Overall, he bought from Ottoman landlords 2–3% of the land. After Baron de Hirsch died in 1896, the Hirsch-founded Jewish Colonisation Association (ICA) started supporting the settlement of Palestine (1896), and Baron Rothschild took an active role in the organization and transferred his Palestinian land holdings as well as 15 million francs to it. In 1924, he reorganized the Palestinian branch of the ICA into the Palestine Jewish Colonisation Association (PICA), which acquired more than of land and set up business ventures. In Tel Aviv, the Rothschild Boulevard is named after him, as are a number of localities throughout Israel which he assisted in founding, including Metulla, Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov, Rishon Lezion and Rosh Pina. A park in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris, the &quot;Parc Edmond de Rothschild&quot; (Edmond de Rothschild Park), is also named after its founder. The Rothschilds also played a significant part in the funding of Israel&#x27;s governmental infrastructure. James A. de Rothschild financed the Knesset building as a gift to the State of Israel and the Supreme Court of Israel building was donated to Israel by Dorothy de Rothschild. Outside the President&#x27;s Chamber is displayed the letter Dorothy de Rothschild wrote to then Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressing her intention to donate a new building for the Supreme Court. The Rothschilds also established the &quot;Yad Hanadiv&quot; philanthropic foundation in 1958.

Interviewed by &quot;Haaretz&quot; in 2010, Baron Benjamin Rothschild, who was a Swiss-based member of the banking family, said that he supported the Israeli–Palestinian peace process: &quot;I understand that it is a complicated business, mainly because of the fanatics and extremists – and I am talking about both sides. I think you have fanatics in Israel. ... In general I am not in contact with politicians. I spoke once with Netanyahu. I met once with an Israeli finance minister, but the less I mingle with politicians the better I feel.&quot; Due to a dispute with the Israeli tax authorities, the baron refused to visit Israel. But his widow Ariane de Rothschild often visits Israel where she manages the Caesarea Foundation. She says: &quot;It is insulting that the state [Israel] casts doubt on us. If there is a family that does not have to prove its commitment to Israel, it&#x27;s ours.&quot;

===Places in Israel named after Rothschild family members===

Primarily due to the generosity and influence of Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, HaNadiv (the Benefactor), on the history of the Land of Israel and the State of Israel, a tradition exists of naming cities, towns and other settlements in Israel in honor of members of the Rothschild family. Six of these places are grouped in the same vicinity, on the Sharon plain, while the others are scattered throughout the country. They are, listed in order of founding:

* Zichron Ya&#x27;akov (Hebrew: Jacob&#x27;s Memory), a town founded in 1882 and named after the Benefactor&#x27;s father, James [Jacob] Mayer de Rothschild (1792–1868) from the Paris branch of the family;
* Mazkeret Batya (Hebrew: Remembrance of Batya), a local council near Tel Aviv, founded in 1883 and named after Betty von Rothschild (1805–1886), the Benefactor&#x27;s mother;
* Bat Shlomo (Hebrew: Salomon&#x27;s Daughter), a moshav near Rehovot, founded in 1889 and also named after the Baron&#x27;s mother, who was the daughter of Salomon Mayer von Rothschild (1774–1855), the Benefactor&#x27;s grandfather from the Vienna branch;
* Meir Shfeya (Hebrew: Mayer&#x27;s Fields), a youth village near Zichron Ya&#x27;acov, founded as a moshava in 1891 and named after Amschel Mayer von Rothschild (1773–1855), the Benefactor&#x27;s grandfather from the Frankfurt branch;
* Givat Ada (Hebrew: Ada&#x27;s Hill), a town near Zichron Ya&#x27;acov, founded in 1903 and named after the Benefactor&#x27;s wife Adelheid von Rothschild (1853–1935), who was also his cousin, from the Naples branch;
* Binyamina, a town near Zichron Ya&#x27;acov, founded in 1922 and named after Benefactor himself (Binyamina was officially merged with Givat Ada in 2003);
* Ashdot Ya&#x27;akov (Hebrew: Jacob&#x27;s Rapids), a kibbutz just south of the Sea of Galilee, founded in 1924 and named after James Armand Edmond de Rothschild (1878–1957), son of the Benefactor;
* Pardes Hanna (Hebrew: Hannah&#x27;s [Citrus] Orchard), a local council near Zichron Ya&#x27;acov, founded in 1929 and named after Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery (née de Rothschild; 1851–1890), daughter of Mayer Anschel Rothschild;
* Shadmot Dvora (Hebrew: Deborah&#x27;s Cultivated Fields), a moshav near Tiberias, founded in 1939 and named after Dorothy de Rothschild (1895–1988), who was James de Rothschild&#x27;s wife and the Benefactor&#x27;s daughter-in-law;
* Sde Eliezer (Hebrew: Eliezer&#x27;s Field), a moshav in the Hula Valley, founded in 1950 and named after Robert Rothschild (1911–1998), a relative of the Benefactor&#x27;s of the French branch.

== Modern businesses, investments, and philanthropy ==

Since the late 19th century, the family has taken a low-key public profile, donating many famous estates, as well as vast quantities of art, to charity, and generally eschewing conspicuous displays of wealth. Today, Rothschild businesses are on a smaller scale than they were throughout the 19th century, although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including: real estate, financial services, mixed farming, energy, mining, winemaking and nonprofits.

===The Rothschild Group===

Since 2003, a group of Rothschild banks have been controlled by Rothschild Continuation Holdings, a Swiss-registered holding company (under the chairmanship of Baron David René de Rothschild). Rothschild Continuation Holdings is in turn controlled by Concordia BV, a Dutch-registered master holding company. Concordia BV is managed by Paris Orléans S.A., a French-registered holding company. Paris Orléans S.A. is ultimately controlled by Rothschild Concordia SAS, a Rothschild&#x27;s family holding company. Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque controls Rothschild banking businesses in France and continental Europe, while Rothschilds Continuation Holdings AG controls a number of Rothschild banks elsewhere, including N M Rothschild &amp; Sons in London. Twenty per cent of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG was sold in 2005 to Jardine Strategic, which is a subsidiary of Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. of Hong Kong. In November 2008, Rabobank Group, the leading investment and private bank in the Netherlands, acquired 7.5% of Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG, and Rabobank and Rothschild entered into a co-operation agreement in the fields of mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) advisory and equity capital markets advisory in the food and agribusiness sectors. It was believed that the move was intended to help Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG gain access to a wider capital pool, enlarging its presence in East Asian markets.

Paris Orléans S.A. is a financial holding company listed on Euronext Paris and controlled by the French and English branches of the Rothschild family. Paris Orléans is the flagship of the Rothschild banking group and controls the Rothschild Group&#x27;s banking activities including N M Rothschild &amp; Sons and Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque. It has over 2,000 employees. Directors of the company include Eric de Rothschild, Robert de Rothschild and Count Philippe de Nicolay.

N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, an English investment bank, does most of its business as an advisor for mergers and acquisitions. In 2004, the investment bank withdrew from the gold market, a commodity the Rothschild bankers had traded in for two centuries. In 2006, it ranked second in UK M&amp;A with deals totalling $104.9 billion. In 2006, the bank recorded a pre-tax annual profit of £83.2 million with assets of £5.5 billion.
=== Edmond de Rothschild Group ===
In 1953, one Swiss member of the family, Edmond Adolphe de Rothschild (1926–1997), founded the LCF Rothschild Group (now Edmond de Rothschild Group) which is based in Geneva and today extends to 15 countries across the world. Although this group is primarily a financial entity, specializing in asset management and private banking, its activities also cover mixed farming, luxury hotels and yacht racing. Edmond de Rothschild Group&#x27;s committee is currently being chaired by Ariane de Rothschild.

In late 2010, Benjamin de Rothschild, the chairman at the time, said that the family had been unaffected by the 2007–2008 financial crisis, due to their conservative business practices: &quot;We came through it well, because our investment managers did not want to put money into crazy things.&quot; He added that the Rothschilds were still a small-scale, traditional family business and took greater care over their clients&#x27; investments than American companies, adding: &quot;The client knows we will not speculate with his money&quot;.

Edmond de Rothschild group includes these companies.
* Banque privée Edmond de Rothschild – Swiss private banking firm
* Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild – French private bank
* La Compagnie Benjamin de Rothschild
* Cogifrance – Real estate
* Compagnie Vinicole Baron Edmond de Rothschild – wine making firm

=== RIT Capital Partners ===
In 1980, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild resigned from N M Rothschild &amp; Sons and took independent control of Rothschild Investment Trust (now RIT Capital Partners, a British investment trust), which has reported assets of $3.4 billion in 2008. It is listed on London Stock Exchange. Lord Rothschild is also one of the major investors behind BullionVault, a gold trading platform.

In 2010 RIT Capital Partners stored a significant proportion of its assets in the form of physical gold. Other assets included oil and energy-related investments.

In 2012, RIT Capital Partners announced it was to buy a 37 per cent stake in a Rockefeller family wealth advisory and asset management group. Commenting on the deal, David Rockefeller, a former patriarch of the Rockefeller family, said: &quot;The connection between our two families remains very strong.&quot;

=== Investments ===
In 1991, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, founded J. Rothschild Assurance Group (now St. James&#x27;s Place Wealth Management) with Sir Mark Weinberg. It is also listed on London Stock Exchange.

In 2001, the Rothschild mansion located at 18 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, was on sale for £85 million, at that time (2001) the most expensive residential property ever to go on sale in the world. It was built in marble, at 9,000 sq ft, with underground parking for 20 cars.

In December 2009, Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild, invested $200 million of his own money in a North Sea oil company.

In January 2010, Nathaniel Rothschild, 5th Baron Rothschild, bought a substantial share of the Glencore mining and oil company&#x27;s market capitalisation. He also bought a large share of the aluminium mining company United Company RUSAL.

During the 19th century, the Rothschilds controlled the Rio Tinto mining corporation, and to this day, Rothschild and Rio Tinto maintain a close business relationship.

=== Wine ===
The Rothschild family has been in the winemaking industry for 150 years. In 1853, Nathaniel de Rothschild purchased Château Brane-Mouton and renamed it Château Mouton Rothschild. In 1868, James Mayer de Rothschild purchased the neighbouring Château Lafite and renamed it Château Lafite Rothschild.

Today, the Rothschild family owns many wine estates: their estates in France include Château Clarke, Château de Malengin, Château Clerc-Milon, Château d&#x27;Armailhac, Château Duhart-Milon, Château Lafite Rothschild, Château de Laversine, Château des Laurets, Château L&#x27;Évangile, Château Malmaison, Château de Montvillargenne, Château Mouton Rothschild, Château de la Muette, Château Rieussec and Château Rothschild d&#x27;Armainvilliers. They also own wine estates across North America, South America, South Africa and Australia.

Especially, Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Lafite Rothschild are classified as Premier Cru Classé—i.e., First Growth, the status referring to a classification of wines from the Bordeaux region of France.

Saskia de Rothschild was named Chairwoman of Château Lafite Rothschild in 2018, succeeding her father, Éric de Rothschild. Château Mouton Rothschild was managed by Philippine de Rothschild until her death in 2014. It is now under the direction of her son Philippe Sereys de Rothschild.

=== Art and charity ===
The family once had one of the largest private art collections in the world, and a significant proportion of the art in the world&#x27;s public museums are Rothschild donations which were sometimes, in the family tradition of discretion, donated anonymously.

Hannah Rothschild was appointed in December 2014 as chair of the board of the National Gallery of London.

== Cultural references ==
In the words of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;This multinational banking family is a byword for wealth, power – and discretion... The Rothschild name has become synonymous with money and power to a degree that perhaps no other family has ever matched.&quot;
Writing of the Rockefeller and Rothschild families, Harry Mount writes: &quot;That is what makes these two dynasties so exceptional – not just their dizzying wealth, but the fact that they have held on to it for so long: and not just the loot, but also their family companies.&quot;

The story of the Rothschild family has been featured in a number of films. The 1934 Hollywood film titled &quot;The House of Rothschild&quot;, starring George Arliss and Loretta Young, recounted the life of Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Nathan Mayer Rothschild (both played by Arliss). Excerpts from this film were incorporated into the Nazi propaganda film &quot;Der ewige Jude&quot; (&quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;) without the permission of the copyright holder. Another Nazi film, &quot;Die Rothschilds&quot; (also called &quot;Aktien auf Waterloo&quot;), was directed by Erich Waschneck in 1940. A Broadway musical entitled &quot;The Rothschilds&quot;, covering the history of the family up to 1818, was nominated for a Tony Award in 1971. Nathaniel Mayer (&quot;Natty&quot;) Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild appears as a minor character in the historical-mystery novel &quot;Stone&#x27;s Fall&quot;, by Iain Pears. Mayer Rothschild is featured in Diana Gabaldon&#x27;s novel &quot;Voyager&quot; as a coin seller summoned to Le Havre by Jamie Fraser to appraise coins, prior to the establishment of the Rothschild dynasty, when Mayer is in his early 20s. The Rothschild name is mentioned by Aldous Huxley in his novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, among many names of historically affluent persons, scientific innovators and others. The character, named Morgana Rothschild, played a relatively minor role in the story. The name Rothschild used as a synonym for extreme wealth inspired the song &quot;If I Were a Rich Man&quot;, which is based on a song from the Tevye the Dairyman stories, written in the Yiddish as , meaning &#x27;If I were a Rothschild&#x27;.

In France, the word &quot;Rothschild&quot; was throughout the 19th and 20th centuries a synonym for seemingly endless wealth, neo-Gothic styles, and epicurean glamour. The family also has lent its name to &quot;,&quot; a very glamorous style of interior decoration whose elements include neo-Renaissance palaces, extravagant use of velvet and gilding, vast collections of armour and sculpture, a sense of Victorian horror vacui, and the highest masterworks of art. Le goût Rothschild has influenced designers such as Robert Denning, Yves Saint Laurent, Vincent Fourcade and others.
== Conspiracy theories ==
Over more than two centuries, the Rothschild family has frequently been the subject of conspiracy theories. These theories take differing forms, such as claiming that the family controls the world&#x27;s wealth and financial institutions or encouraged or discouraged wars between governments. Discussing this and similar views, the historian Niall Ferguson wrote that, 

Many conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family arise from anti-Semitic prejudice and various antisemitic tropes.

<text>Cangas de Onís (Asturian: &quot;Cangues d&#x27;Onís&quot; &quot;valleys of Onís&quot;) is a municipality in the eastern part of the province and autonomous community of Asturias in the northwest of Spain. The capital of the municipality is also Cangas de Onís.

More than seventy square kilometres of the &quot;conceyu&quot; form part of the Parque nacional de los Picos de Europa.

==History==
Within the park is the village of Covadonga, where the battle of Covadonga (about 722), the first major victory by a Christian military force in Iberia after the Islamic conquest, marks the starting-point of the Reconquista. 
Cangas de Onís is the site of the first church constructed in post-conquest Iberia, Santa Cruz de Cangas de Onís (737), built on an ancient dolmen.
Cangas de Onís is also very known for being the first capital of the Kingdom of Asturias.
A parish named Cangas de Onís is attested for the 14th century. The stone bridge across the Sella River was built in the 14th or 15th century.

Cangas de Onís was represented in the Junta General of the principality of Asturias in 1504.
Covadonga began to be developed as a pilgrimage site in the 16th century, attracting commerce.
The settlement of Cangas de Onís grew rapidly in the mid 19th century.
A meteorite fall is recorded for the year 1866.

Cangas de Onís/Cangues d&#x27;Onís was bombarded several times in the Spanish Civil War.
It served as the seat of the Regional Council in the &quot;pre-autonomous regime&quot; of 1978–1981 prior to the entering into force of the

<text>Dorothy Gladys &quot;Dodie&quot; Smith (3 May 1896 – 24 November 1990) was an English novelist and playwright. She is best known for writing &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; (1948) and the children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; (1956). Other works include &quot;Dear Octopus&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Starlight Barking&quot; (1967). &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; was adapted into a 1961 animated film and a 1996 live-action film, both produced by Disney. Her novel &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; was voted number 82 as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s 100 best-loved novels&quot; by the British public as part of the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read (2003), and was adapted into a film released the same year.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Smith was born on 3 May 1896 in a house named Stoneycroft (number 118) on Bury New Road, Whitefield, near Bury in Lancashire, England. She was an only child. Her parents were Ernest and Ella Smith (née Furber). Ernest was a bank manager; he died in 1898 when Dodie was two years old. Dodie and her mother moved to Old Trafford to live with her grandparents, William and Margaret Furber. Dodie&#x27;s childhood home, Kingston House, was at 609 Stretford Road, and faced the Manchester Ship Canal. She lived with her mother, maternal grandparents, two aunts and three uncles.

In Smith&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Look Back with Love&quot; (1974), she credits her grandfather William as one of three reasons she became a playwright. He was an avid theatregoer, and they had long talks about Shakespeare and melodrama. The second reason was that her uncle Harold Furber, an amateur actor, read plays with her and introduced her to contemporary drama. Thirdly, her mother had wanted to be an actress, an ambition frustrated except for walk-on parts, once in the company of Sarah Bernhardt. Smith wrote her first play at the age of ten, and she began acting in minor roles during her teens at the Manchester Athenaeum Dramatic Society. There is a blue plaque commemorating the building where Dorothy grew up. The formative years of Dorothy&#x27;s childhood were spent at this house.

===Move to London===

In 1910 Ella remarried and moved to London with her new husband and the 14-year-old Dodie, who attended school both in Manchester and at St Paul&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, London. In 1914 Dodie entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Her first role came in Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s play &quot;Playgoers&quot;. Other roles after RADA included a Chinese girl in &quot;Mr. Wu&quot;, a parlour maid in &quot;Ye Gods&quot;, and a young mother in &quot;Niobe&quot;, which was directed by Basil Dean, who would later buy her play &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot;.

She was also in the Portsmouth Repertory Theatre, travelled with a YMCA company to entertain troops in France during World War I, toured with the French comedy &quot;French Leave&quot;, and appeared as Anne in Galsworthy&#x27;s play &quot;The Pigeon&quot; at the Everyman Theatre and at a festival in Zürich, Switzerland. While Ella was dying of breast cancer, she and Dodie became devotees of Christian Science.

===Career after acting===

Even though Smith had sold a movie script, &quot;Schoolgirl Rebels&quot;, using the pseudonym Charles Henry Percy, and written a one-act play, &quot;British Talent&quot;, that premiered at the Three Arts Club in 1924, she still had a hard time finding steady work. In 1923, she accepted a job in Heal and Son&#x27;s furniture store in London and became the toy buyer (and mistress of the chairman, Ambrose Heal). She wrote her first staged play, &quot;Autumn Crocus&quot;, in 1931 using the pseudonym C.L. Anthony. Its success, and the discovery of her identity by journalists, inspired the newspaper headline, &quot;Shopgirl Writes Play&quot;. The show starred Fay Compton and Francis Lederer.

Smith&#x27;s fourth play &quot;Call It a Day&quot; was acted by the Theatre Guild on 28 January 1936 and ran for 194 performances. It ran in London for 509 performances, the longest run of any of Smith&#x27;s plays to date. American critic Joseph Wood Krutch compared it favorably to George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber&#x27;s play &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; and Edward Knoblock&#x27;s &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. He said the London production &quot;stays pretty consistently on the level of comedy and imposes upon its brittle structure no greater emotional weight than that structure is capable of bearing.&quot;

The success of &quot;Call It a Day&quot; enabled Smith to purchase The Barretts, a cottage near the village of Finchingfield, Essex. Her next play, &quot;Bonnet Over the Windmill&quot; (1937), was not as successful. It concerns three aspiring young actresses and their landlady, a middle-aged former music-hall performer, and the young women&#x27;s attempts to attract the attention of a playwright and a theatre producer with hopes of obtaining dramatic roles.

Her next play, &quot;Dear Octopus&quot; (1938), featured Dame Marie Tempest and Sir John Gielgud. The unusual title refers to a toast in the play: &quot;To the family—that dear octopus from whose tentacles we never quite escape, nor, in our inmost hearts, ever quite wish to.&quot; Brooks Atkinson termed Smith a &quot;domestic panoramatist&quot; and compared her to many English novelists, from Samuel Richardson to Archibald Marshall; he also described her as the &quot;appointed recorder&quot; of the English family. The production in London ran for 376 performances, compared to that in New York of only 53.

When Smith travelled to America to cast &quot;Dear Octopus&quot;, she brought with her Alec Macbeth Beesley (son of &quot;Titanic&quot; survivor Lawrence Beesley), who had also worked at Heal&#x27;s and had become her longtime friend and business manager. The two married in 1939. She would not have another play staged in London until 1952, though &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot; did play at the Plymouth Theatre in 1943. The show featured Katharine Cornell and Raymond Massey.

Smith lived for many years in Dorset Square, Marylebone, London, which a blue plaque now commemorates; her date of birth is shown inaccurately as 1895 instead of 1896.

===Later life===

During the 1940s Smith and Beesley relocated to the United States to avoid difficulties due to his being a conscientious objector. She felt homesick for Britain, which inspired her first novel, written in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, named &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; (1948). She and Beesley also spent time in Beverly Hills, Malibu, and Wilton, Connecticut.

During their American interlude, the couple became friends with writers Christopher Isherwood, Charles Brackett and John Van Druten. In her memoirs Smith credits Beesley with suggesting to Van Druten that he adapt Isherwood&#x27;s Sally Bowles story &quot;Goodbye to Berlin&quot; into a play (the Van Druten play, &quot;I Am a Camera&quot;, later became the musical &quot;Cabaret&quot;). In her memoirs, Smith acknowledges having received writing advice from her friend, the novelist A. J. Cronin.

Smith&#x27;s first play back in London, &quot;Letter from Paris&quot;, was an adaptation of Henry James&#x27;s short novel &quot;The Reverberator&quot;. She used the adapting style of William Archibald&#x27;s play &quot;The Innocents&quot; (adapted from &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;) and Ruth and Augustus Goetz&#x27;s play &quot;The Heiress&quot; (adapted from &quot;Washington Square&quot;).

In the 1970s she lived in Stambourne, Essex.

===Death===

Smith died in 1990 (three years after Beesley) in Uttlesford, north Essex, England. She was cremated and her ashes scattered to the wind. She had named Julian Barnes as her literary executor, a job she thought would not involve much work. Barnes writes of the complicated task in his essay &quot;Literary Executions&quot;, revealing among other things how he secured the return of the film rights to &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot;, which had been owned by Disney since 1949. Smith&#x27;s personal papers are housed in Boston University&#x27;s Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, and include manuscripts, photographs, artwork and correspondence (including letters from Christopher Isherwood and John Gielgud).

==&quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;==

Smith and Beesley loved dogs and kept Dalmatians as pets; at one point the couple had nine of them. The first was named &quot;Pongo&quot;, which became the name Smith used for the canine protagonist of her &quot;The Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; novel. Smith had the idea for the novel when one of her friends observed a group of her Dalmatians and said &quot;Those dogs would make a lovely fur coat&quot;.

The novel has been adapted by Disney twice, an animated film in 1961 called &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot; and a live-action film in 1996 called &quot;101 Dalmatians&quot;. Although both of the Disney films spawned a sequel film, &quot;101 Dalmatians II: Patch&#x27;s London Adventure&quot; and &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot;, neither sequel has any connection to Smith&#x27;s own sequel, &quot;The Starlight Barking&quot;.

<text>Béla Kun (, born Béla Kohn; 20 February 1886 – 29 August 1938) was a Hungarian communist revolutionary and politician who governed the Hungarian Soviet Republic in 1919. After attending Franz Joseph University at Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania), Kun worked as a journalist up until the First World War. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army and was captured by the Imperial Russian Army in 1916, after which he was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in the Urals. Kun embraced communist ideas during his time in Russia, and in 1918 he co-founded a Hungarian arm of the Russian Communist Party in Moscow. He befriended Vladimir Lenin and fought for the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War.

In November 1918, Kun returned to Hungary with Soviet support and set up the Party of Communists in Hungary. Adopting Lenin&#x27;s tactics, he agitated against the government of Mihály Károlyi and achieved great popularity despite being imprisoned. After his release in March 1919, Kun led a successful coup d&#x27;état, formed a Communist-Social Democratic coalition government and proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Though the &quot;de jure&quot; leader of the republic was prime minister Sándor Garbai, the &quot;de facto&quot; power was in the hands of foreign minister Kun, who and received direct orders and advice from the Kremlin.

The new regime collapsed four months later in the face of Romanian advance. Kun fled to Soviet Russia, where he worked as a functionary in the Communist International bureaucracy as the head of the Crimean Revolutionary Committee from 1920. He organised and actively participated in the Red Terror in Crimea (1920–1921), following which he participated in the 1921 March Action, a failed Communist uprising in Germany.

During the Great Purge of the late 1930s, Kun was accused of Trotskyism, arrested, interrogated, tried, and executed in quick succession. He was posthumously rehabilitated by Soviet leadership in 1956, following the death of Joseph Stalin and the De-Stalinization period under Nikita Khrushchev.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Béla Kohn, later known as Béla Kun, was born on 20 February 1886 in the village of Lele, located near Szilágycseh, Szilágy County, Kingdom of Hungary (today part of Hodod, Satu Mare County, Romania). His father, Samu Kohn, was a lapsed Jewish village notary. His mother was Hungarian, but converted to Judaism upon marriage. Despite his parents&#x27; secular outlook, he was educated at the Silvania Főgimnázium in Zilah (present-day Silvania National College, Zalău) and a famous Reformed &quot;kollegium&quot; (grammar school) in the city of Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca, Romania).

At the &quot;kollegium&quot; Kun won the prize for best essay on Hungarian literature that allowed him to attend a gymnasium. His essay was on the poet Sándor Petőfi and the concluding paragraphs were:

The storming rage of Petőfi&#x27;s soul... turned against the privileged classes, against the people&#x27;s oppressor... and confronted them with revolutionary abandon. Petőfi felt that the country would not be saved through moderation, but through the use of the most extreme means available. He detested even the thought of cowardice... Petőfi&#x27;s vision was correct. There is no room for prudence in revolutions whose fate and eventual success is always decided by boldness and raw courage... this is why Petőfi condemned his compatriots for the sin of opportunism and hesitation when faced with the great problems of their age... Petőfi&#x27;s works must be regarded as the law of the Hungarian soul... and of the... love of the country&quot;.

In 1904 he began to study law at Franz Joseph University in Kolozsvár. Béla magyarized his birth surname, &quot;Kohn,&quot; to &quot;Kun&quot; in 1904, although the almanac of the university still referred to him in print by his former name as late as 1909. There is no archival evidence that he took any formal action to change the spelling of his name, although it is clear that from 1904 all those around him referred to him as Béla Kun rather than Kohn, and he likewise used the Magyar variant in his signature.

Before World War I, he was a muck-raking journalist with sympathies for the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in Kolozsvár. In addition, Kun served on the Kolozsvár Social Insurance Board, from which he was later to be accused of embezzling. He had a fiery reputation and was involved in duels several times. In May 1913 he married Irén Gál, a music teacher of middle-class background from Nagyenyed (today Aiud, Alba County); they had two children, Ágnes, born in 1915, and Miklós, born in 1920.

===Early political career===
During his early education at Kolozsvár, Kun became friends with the poet Endre Ady, who introduced him to many members of Budapest&#x27;s left-wing intelligentsia.

Kun fought with the Austro-Hungarian Army in World War I, and was captured and made a prisoner of war in 1916 by the Imperial Russian Army. He was sent to a prisoner of war camp in the Ural Mountains, where he was exposed to Communism. The Russian Revolution in March 1917 and the subsequent Bolshevik coup the following November not only set him free, but provided him with unforeseen opportunities.

In March 1918, in Moscow, Kun co-founded the Hungarian Group of the Russian Communist Party (the predecessor to the Party of Communists in Hungary) with other former Hungarian POWs. He travelled widely, including to Petrograd and Moscow. He came to know Vladimir Lenin there, but inside the party he promoted ultra-radical left-wing political opposition to Lenin and the mainstream Bolsheviks. Kun and his friends, such as the Italian Umberto Terracini and the Hungarian Mátyás Rákosi, aggregated around Grigory Zinoviev or Karl Radek. Whereas Lenin advocated making peace with the Central Powers, despite the harsh conditions they imposed, in order to &quot;save the revolution&quot;, Kun and his group took the side of Nikolai Bukharin, who wanted to continue and expand the war to transform it into an international revolutionary struggle to impose Communism on the rest of Europe. Lenin often called them &quot;kunerists&quot;, and said of Kun, &quot;We can see that this man comes from a country of poets and dreamers.&quot;

In the Russian Civil War in 1918, Kun fought for the Bolsheviks. During this time, he first started to make detailed plans for a Communist revolution in Hungary. In November 1918, with at least several hundred other Hungarian Communists and with a large sum of money provided by the Soviets, he returned to Hungary.

===Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic===
In Hungary, the resources of a shattered government were further strained by refugees from lands lost to the Allies during the war, and which were due to be lost permanently under the Treaty of Trianon. Rampant inflation, housing shortages, mass unemployment, food shortages and coal shortages further weakened the economy and stimulated widespread protests. In October 1918, the Aster Revolution saw the inauguration the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, under an unstable coalition government of Socialists and other radicals. Led by Béla Kun, the inner circle of the freshly established party returned to Budapest from Moscow on 16 November 1918. On 24 November they created the Party of Communists from Hungary (Hungarian: Kommunisták Magyarországi Pártja).

He immediately began a highly energetic propaganda campaign against the government of President Mihály Károlyi, and his Social Democratic allies, accusing them of betraying the working class, of lack of class consciousness, of not wanting to continue the expropriation of large domains and the big capital. His aim was to copy the tactics Lenin had used so successfully, which included pandering to the demands of all the discontented in society: unemployed, pensioners, veterans, employees; relentlessly denouncing the Government and the parties that supported it; as well as infiltrating the trade unions, discrediting their executives, and undermining the Socialist Party by dividing the more moderate leaders from the more extreme ones.

His speeches had a considerable impact on his audiences. One who heard such a speech wrote in his diary:

Yesterday I heard Kun speak... it was an audacious, hateful, enthusiastic oratory. [...] He knows his audience and rules over them... Factory workers long at odds with the Social Democratic Party leaders, young intellectuals, teachers, doctors, lawyers, clerks who came to his room... meet Kun and Marxism.

In addition, the Communists held frequent marches and rallies and organised strikes. Desiring to achieve a revolution in Hungary, he communicated by telegraph with Vladimir Lenin to garner support from the Bolsheviks, which would ultimately not materialise.

Despite Kun&#x27;s efforts, by February 1919 the Communists had fewer than 30,000 members, compared with the 700,000 of the Social Democrats. Kun knew that if the upcoming elections went ahead, they would be a disaster for the Communists. Therefore, the Communist press launched a campaign against a fictitious &quot;reactionary conspiracy&quot; which they claimed the Károlyi government was either unaware of, or unwilling to crush. On 20 February 1919 the Communists invaded and pillaged the headquarters of the Socialist daily newspaper. The attack left a few dead and many injured, primarily policemen who had tried to stop the Communist aggression. Kun and 67 other Communist leaders were arrested.

However, despite the apparent failure of this adventure, there were two factors that worked to Kun&#x27;s advantage. First, the press, even the non-socialist press, claimed that the imprisoned Communists had been mistreated by some members of the police force that supposedly wanted to avenge the death of their colleagues, and also publicised the supposedly courageous attitude of prisoner Béla Kun, a man previously little known outside his circle of followers. This greatly increased the popularity of Kun and sympathy toward the Communists among the general public. Concerned by this unintended shift in public opinion, the government gave orders that while in prison Kun be allowed to carry out any political activity he wished, which meant he was able to continue directing the Hungarian Communist Party from his cell. There were days in which Kun received up to four hundred visitors, mainly far-left Social Democrats who now considered Kun, whose stature was already increased by the prestige of participating in the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, a martyr.

The second was that on 19 March 1919, French Lt-Col Fernand Vix presented the &quot;Vix Note&quot;, ordering Hungarian forces to be pulled back further from where they were stationed, clearing the areas of Debrecen and Makó. It was assumed that the military lines would be the new frontiers that would be established by the peace conference between Hungary and the Allies. Károlyi resigned, perhaps in order not to link his name to the acceptance of that imposition, and soon after a proclamation was made public in his name stating that he had voluntarily given up his powers to a &quot;new government of the proletariat&quot;, i.e., the Socialists. Later in his life Károlyi denied that he had made such a statement, though he did not disavow it at the time or in the following years during which he remained quietly in Hungary. The Vix Note created a massive upsurge of nationalist outrage, and the Hungarians resolved to fight the Allies rather than accept the new demarcation lines.
The Social Democrats approached Kun on the subject of a coalition government, hoping he would be able to use his Bolshevik connections to bring the Red Army to Hungary&#x27;s aid. So desperate were they for support from Moscow that it was Kun, a captive, who dictated the terms to his captors. This was despite the Red Army&#x27;s full involvement in the Russian Civil War and the unlikelihood that it could be of any direct military assistance. Kun proposed the merger of the Social Democrat and Communist parties, the establishment of a Soviet Republic and several other radical measures, which the Social Democrats agreed to.

===Hungarian Soviet Republic===

On 21 March 1919, the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the second Communist regime in Europe after Russia itself, was proclaimed; the Social Democrats and the Communists merged under the interim name Hungarian Socialist Party, and Béla Kun was released from prison and sworn into office.

The nominal head of the Soviet Republic was a Socialist leader, Sándor Garbai, but in practice power rested with Kun, although officially he was only People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and from April 1919 also People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence. As he told Lenin, &quot;My personal influence in the Revolutionary Governing Council is such that the dictatorship of the proletariat is firmly established, since the masses are backing me.&quot;

The Social Democrats continued to hold the majority of seats in government. Of the thirty-three People&#x27;s Commissars of the Revolutionary Governing Council that ruled the Soviet Republic, fourteen were former Communists, seventeen were former Social Democrats and two had no party affiliation. With the exception of Kun, every Commissar was a former Social Democrat and every Deputy Commissar a former Communist. Despite the fact that the Socialists were by far more numerous, they passively accepted the leadership and the programme of the smaller but far more active and determined Communist Party, which claimed to represent the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;.

In the hope of placating the new Hungarian regime, the victorious Entente expressed willingness to bring the military demarcation to the line specified by the armistice of Belgrade the previous November, stating however that it would have no relevance to the final clauses of the peace treaty. This gesture was an undeniable success for the Socialist-Communist government which was thus offered some badly needed breathing space. However Kun rejected the proposal, declaring during a rally on 19 April: Comrades, we do not profess the doctrine of territorial integrity, but we want to live, and this is why we did not accept that our freed proletarian brothers living in the neutralised zone be rejected under the yoke of capitalism. To do so would deprive the Hungarian proletariat of the physical means necessary to live. [...] It is a matter, therefore, which concerns the struggle between the international revolution and the international counter-revolution.However he stated in a letter to Lenin a few days later, on 22 April, possibly to exculpate himself from the suspicion of harbouring nationalist sentiment: Whatever happens, all our actions will be dictated by the interests of the world revolution. We do not think even for a moment to sacrifice the interests of the world revolution to those of one of its components. Even if we were obliged to sign a peace &#x27;à la Brest-Litovsk&#x27;, we would do it with the clear conscience which inspired you when you made the Brest-Litovsk peace, concluded against my will and against the will of the Left Communists.
Given the disparity in power between Hungary and the Allies, Hungarian chances for victory were slim at best. To buy time, Kun tried to negotiate with the Allies, meeting the South African General Jan Smuts at a summit in Budapest in April. Agreement proved impossible, and Hungary was soon at war later in April with the Kingdom of Romania (as part of the Hungarian–Romanian War) and Czechoslovakia (as part of the Hungarian–Czechoslovak War), both aided by France.

The &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; was characterised from almost the beginning by harsh measures not only against the old ruling classes, but also against the peasants. The first action of the new government was the nationalization of the large majority of private property in Hungary. Despite their promises, Béla Kun&#x27;s government chose not to redistribute land to the peasantry. Instead, all land was to be converted into collective farms and former estate owners, managers, and bailiffs were to be retained as the new collective farm managers. The Communists remained highly unpopular in the Hungarian countryside, where they had little to no actual authority, and from which the communist paramilitary group the Lenin Boys confiscated food for the cities.

Furthermore, the initial measures of the government in the military field included the elimination of &quot;non-proletarians&quot; from the new Hungarian Red Army, the abolition of conscription and the introduction of voluntary recruitment. The result was catastrophic: in three weeks only 5,000 &quot;workers&quot; had asked to enlist. Equally ineffective were the social measures, beginning with the reduction of the rental fees and wage increases immediately negated by inflation. The failures of the Communists in economic issues meant that in three weeks they were excluded from economic affairs by the ex-Socialists. The Communists, however, retained control of the political police. They unleashed terror gangs of thugs called the Lenin Boys who went hunting for &quot;bourgeois&quot; and &quot;counter-revolutionaries&quot;, and committed armed robberies, kidnappings, shootings, and hangings.

This indiscriminate terror, in which Kun&#x27;s friends, Tibor Szamuely and Ottó Korvin, proved especially bloodthirsty, attracted protests from the sole representative of the Allied governments in Budapest, Italian lieutenant colonel Guido Romanelli, which Kun rejected. It also had the effect of splitting the government and dividing the Communists themselves, some of whom doubted the usefulness of the atrocities committed. Kun proved unable to control his more extreme followers, particularly Ferenc Jancsik, Ferenc Münnich, Szamuely, and Mátyás Rákosi. Members of the government demanded Kun either stop the atrocities committed by his men, or face the hostility of organised workers and unions. In response Kun sent his friends as political commissars to the front where, however, the situation was not much better.

The Romanian Army had launched an offensive on 17 April 1919 and by the end of the month they were only from Budapest. On 26 April Kun was forced to admit publicly that he had made a mistake in rejecting the proposals of the Allies, and spoke of resignation. The leaders of the trade unions still controlled by ex-Socialists recruited an army of 50,000 men who managed to halt the Romanian troops and to reoccupy the most important cities which had been lost in Upper Hungary. However, this victory was attributed to the People&#x27; Commissar for Defence, Vilmos Böhm, and his soldiers, all from the Socialist Party, and not to the Communist political commissars Rákosi and Münnich.

In the second half of June, Georges Clemenceau proposed a memorandum that promised a cessation of hostilities by the Entente in return for an immediate evacuation of Upper Hungary by the Hungarian Army, which Kun accepted, though he stated in a speech that &quot;The imperialist peace that we are forced to conclude will not last longer than that of Brest-Litovsk, because of the revolution that will inevitably burst out in other European countries.&quot; One of these &quot;inevitable&quot; revolutions was to be the insurrection Hungarian Communist agents were planning in neighbouring Austria. However, Austrian police discovered the plot and arrested the organisers the day before the coup was to be carried out.

The domestic situation was rapidly worsening as a result of the regime&#x27;s actions, with not only former army officers and Catholic and Protestant clergy but urban workers, the Communist&#x27;s primary base of support, becoming increasingly disaffected. On 24 June, an uprising against the regime in Budapest was suppressed after twenty hours of fighting in the streets. At the same time an anarchist conspiracy was uncovered and suppressed (its members shot) in Budapest and other cities. The government retaliated with secret police, revolutionary tribunals and semiregular detachments such as Tibor Szamuely&#x27;s bodyguards, the Lenin Boys; this renewed campaign of repression became known as the Red Terror. Of those arrested, an estimated 370 to about 600 were killed; others place the number at 590. Subsequently, the White Terror that followed the fall of the Communist regime claimed 10 times as many victims.

At the front, the Hungarians had suffered repeated defeats at the hands of the Romanians. In the middle of July 1919, Hungary launched a major counter-offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal Louis Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, wrote to Marshal Ferdinand Foch on 21 July 1919:We are convinced that the Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu&#x27;s promise. You see, Marshal, we have nothing to fear from the Hungarian army. I can assure you that the Hungarian Soviets will last no more than two or three weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation surely will.

The Bolsheviks promised to invade Romania and link up with Kun and were on the verge of doing so, but military reversals suffered by the Red Army in Ukraine halted the invasion of Romania before it began. When the Romanian Army crossed the river Tisza at the end of July they met virtually no opposition. However, by this point the regime was facing, in Kun&#x27;s own words, a &quot;crisis of power, economy and morale&quot; and most fatally, of popular support. The former Social Democrats had withdrawn completely from government; the rural peasantry were disillusioned by the unfulfilled promises of land redistribution and by the decision of the regime to pay for agricultural products in a new paper currency they did not trust. Most fatally, the &quot;industrial proletariat&quot; in whose name the dictatorship had been established refused to fight for a cause they no longer considered their own.

The only hope for saving the Hungarian Soviet Republic had been &quot;the military intervention of the Red Army or a revolution in one or more other European countries.&quot; Both these hopes had now failed. On 1 August, Kun gave his last speech in Hungary, stating:
The Hungarian proletariat betrayed not their leaders but itself. [...] If there had been in Hungary a proletariat with the consciousness of the dictatorship of the proletariat it would not collapse in this way [...] I would have liked to see the proletariat fighting on the barricades declaring that it would rather die than give up power. [...] The proletariat which continued to shout in factories, &#x27;Down with the dictatorship of the proletariat&#x27;, will be even less satisfied with any future government.&quot;
He fled to Austria a few hours after, and the Romanian forces took Budapest three days later. Historian and former Italian diplomat to Hungary Alberto Indelicato attributed the downfall of the regime not to external military intervention by the allies, but to the regime&#x27;s own internal flaws, stating
Whereas the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; could be proclaimed as a result of international political events which weighed heavily on the whole affair, the fall of &quot;the Republic of Councils&quot; did not occur because of the intervention of the reactionary circles of the Entente or of the &quot;White&quot; Hungarian counter-revolution (as a Communist legend maintains and is still affirmed by some partisan historians), but because of its inherent weaknesses, the consequence of its internal, social and economic policies.

===Activity in Crimea===

Béla Kun went into exile in Vienna, then controlled by the Social Democratic Party of Austria. He was captured and interned in Austria, where he spent his time interned at the Karlstein castle, together with the majority of the former People&#x27;s Commissars of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Conditions for the internees were difficult: the castle&#x27;s rooms were not heated, and all the internees contracted scabies due to the castle&#x27;s unsanitary health conditions. Despite these hardships, during his permanence in the castle Kun was able to give interviews to visiting American, British, and Italian journalists. In February 1920, Kun and the other People&#x27;s Commissars were transferred to Steinhof and confined to a wing of the local mental asylum. During their stay at Steinhof, the People&#x27;s Commissars survived two attempted murders. White Hungarians attempted to storm the building and execute the People&#x27;s Commissars, but were deterred by the Austrian police. On April 4th, Easter Sunday, a package signed &quot;from comrades in Vienna&quot; was delivered to the asylum. The package contained chocolate, oranges, and other desserts, which the internees proceeded to share with each other. Within a few hours, they began to exhibit symptoms of poisoning. A later investigation revealed that the sweets had been laced with atropine, but the prompt administration of gastric lavages saved the Commissars from more serious consequences. In July 1920, Béla Kun was released in exchange for Austrian prisoners in Russia. He never returned to Hungary. Once in Russia, he rejoined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Kun was put in charge of the regional Revolutionary Committee in Crimea, which during the Russian Civil War changed hands numerous times and was for a time a stronghold for the anti-Bolshevik White Army. It was in Crimea that the White Russians led by General Wrangel fell to the Red Army in 1920. About 50,000 prisoners of war and anti-Bolshevik civilians who had surrendered after they had been promised amnesty, were subsequently executed, on Kun&#x27;s and Rosalia Zemlyachka&#x27;s order, with Lenin&#x27;s approval. Mass arrests and executions were carried out under Kun&#x27;s administration. Between 60,000 and 70,000 inhabitants of the Crimea were murdered in the process. The figures related to the massacre in Crimea remain contested. Anarchist and Bolshevik Victor Serge gave a lower figure for White officers around 13,000 which he claims were exaggerated. Yet, he condemned Kun for his treacherous actions towards allied anarchists and surrendering whites. According to social scientist, Nikolay Zayats, from the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus the large, “fantastic” estimates derived from eyewitness accounts and White army emigre press. A Crimean Cheka report in 1921 showed that 441 people were shot with a modern estimation that 5,000-12,000 people in total were executed in Crimea.

===The &quot;March Action&quot; in Germany===
Kun became a leading figure in the Comintern as an ally of Grigory Zinoviev. In March 1921, he was sent to Germany to advise the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and encouraged the KPD to follow the &quot;Theory of the Offensive&quot; as supported by Zinoviev, August Thalheimer, Paul Frölich, and others which in the words of Ruth Fischer meant &quot;the working class could be moved only when set in motion by a series of offensive acts.&quot;

On 27 March, leaders of the Communist Party of Germany decided to launch a &quot;revolutionary offensive&quot; in support of miners in central Germany. Kun along with Thallheimer were among the driving force behind the attempted revolutionary campaign known as &quot;Märzaktion&quot; (&quot;March Action&quot;), which ultimately ended in failure.

In the end, Lenin blamed himself for appointing Kun and charged him with responsibility for the failure of the German revolution. He was considerably angered by Kun&#x27;s actions and his failure to secure a general uprising in Germany. In a closed Congress of the Operative Committee — as Victor Serge writes — Lenin called his actions idiotic (&quot;les bêtises de Béla Kun&quot;). György Lukács, moreover, claimed that Kun acted through &quot;demagogy, violence and, if need be, bribery&quot;, and recounted an incident in the summer of 1920 when it was discovered that Kun bribed his supporters by sending them gold deliveries (he had supposedly stolen the gold from requisitioning that was carried out in the Russian Revolution). László Rudas admitted to receiving gold from Kun. But Kun did not lose his membership in the Operative Committee, and the closing document accepted at the end of the sitting formally acknowledged the &quot;battle spirit&quot; of the German Communists.

Kun was not stripped of his Party offices, but the March Action was the end of the radical opposition and of the theory of &quot;Permanent Offensive&quot;. Lenin wrote &quot;The final analysis of things shows that Levi was politically right in many ways. The thesis of Thallheimer and Béla Kun is politically totally false. Phrases and bare attending, playing the radical leftist.&quot;.

Throughout the 1920s Kun was a prominent Comintern operative, serving mostly in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, but his notoriety ultimately stopped him from being useful for undercover work.

===Later career===

Kun&#x27;s final undercover assignment ended in 1928 when he was arrested in Vienna by the local police for travelling on a forged passport. Back in Moscow, he spent much of his time feuding with other Hungarian Communist émigrés, several of whom he denounced to the Soviet secret police, the OGPU, which arrested and imprisoned them in the late 1920s and early 1930s. During the Comintern&#x27;s &quot;Third Period&quot; from 1928 to 1935, Kun was a prominent supporter of the Social Fascism line that revealed the Social-Democrats&#x27; role as &quot;social fascism&quot; because they sought the preservation of capitalism precisely when it was in crisis, an animosity in large part owing to Kun&#x27;s strained relations with the Hungarian Social Democrats, whom he believed had betrayed him sixteen years earlier. In 1934, Kun was charged with preparing the agenda for the 7th Congress of the Comintern, in which the Social Fascism line was to be abandoned and the Popular Front was to be the new line for Communists all over the world, a policy change that Kun opposed. Instead of submitting to party discipline, Kun did his best to sabotage the adoption of the Popular Front policy, which led to his formal sanction for insubordination. In 1935–36, the leadership of the émigré Hungarian Communist Party was thrown into crisis as Kun sought to prevent the adoption of the Popular Front policy, which occasioned a vigorous round of party in-fighting. Beyond policy, there was also a clash of personalities as Kun&#x27;s abrasive and autocratic leadership style had left him with many enemies. These individuals saw the dispute over whether the Hungarian Communist Party was to adopt the Popular Front strategy as a chance to bring down Kun, whom many Hungarian émigrés deeply hated. His embattled position led Kun to denounce one of his leading enemies in the Comintern, Dmitry Manuilsky, to the NKVD as a &quot;Trotskyite&quot;; in turn, Manuilsky, who was sympathetic to the anti-Kun faction, had also denounced Kun to the NKVD as a &quot;Trotskyite&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
During the Great Purge of the late 1930s, Kun was accused of Trotskyism and brutally beaten and arrested by the NKVD on 28 June 1937. Little was known about his subsequent fate beyond the fact that he never returned. Even an official Hungarian Communist biographer with official access to the Communist International&#x27;s archives in Moscow was denied information during the mid-1970s.

Only some time after the fall of the Soviet Union and the opening of certain archives in the aftermath did Kun&#x27;s fate become public: after a brief incarceration and interrogation, he was hauled before a judicial troika on charges of having acted as the leader of a &quot;counter-revolutionary terrorist organization.&quot; Kun was found guilty and sentenced to death at the end of this brief secret trial. The sentence was carried out later that day at the Kommunarka shooting ground.

When Kun was politically rehabilitated in 1956, as part of the de-Stalinization process, the Soviet Communist Party told its Hungarian counterpart that Kun had died in prison on 30 November 1939. In 1989, the Soviet government announced that Kun had actually been executed in the Gulag more than a year earlier than that, on 29 August 1938.

After World War II the Soviets set up the Marxist–Leninist Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic under the leadership of Mátyás Rákosi, one of Kun&#x27;s few surviving colleagues from the 1919 coup.

<text>The Hundred and One Dalmatians is a 1956 children&#x27;s novel by Dodie Smith about the kidnapping of a family of Dalmatian puppies. It was originally serialized in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Day&quot; as &quot;The Great Dog Robbery&quot;, and details the adventures of two dalmatians named Pongo and Missis as they rescue their puppies from a fur farm. A 1967 sequel, &quot;The Starlight Barking&quot;, continues from the end of the novel.

==Plot==
Dalmatians Pongo and Missis live with the newly married Mr. and Mrs. Dearly and their two nannies, Nanny Cook and Nanny Butler. Mr. Dearly is a &quot;financial wizard&quot; who has been granted lifelong tax exemption and lent a house on the Outer Circle in Regent&#x27;s Park in return for wiping out the government debt. The dogs consider the humans their pets but allow them to think that they are the owners.

One day, while walking Pongo and Missis, Mr. and Mrs. Dearly have a chance meeting with an old schoolmate of Mrs. Dearly: Cruella de Vil, a wealthy woman so fixated on fur clothing that she married a furrier and forces him to keep his collection in their home so she can wear the pieces whenever she likes. She admires the two dogs and expresses a desire to have a Dalmatian-skin coat. Later, Missis gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. Concerned that Missis will not be able to feed them all, the humans join in to help. As Mrs. Dearly looks for a canine wet nurse, she finds an exhausted liver-spotted Dalmatian in the middle of the road in the rain. She has the dog, who has recently given birth, treated by a vet and names her Perdita (meaning &quot;lost&quot;). Perdita helps to nurse the pups and becomes a member of the family. She tells Pongo about her lost love Prince and the resulting litter of puppies, which were sold by her neglectful owner. She had run away looking for those puppies.

Cruella happened to be in the house when the puppies started to arrive, and had expressed a desire to buy them, which was rebuffed. After she pays a second visit to the house and is told again that the Dearlys have no intention of putting the puppies up for sale, she hires thieves to steal them for her. The humans fail to trace the pups, but through the &quot;Twilight Barking&quot;, a forum of communication in which dogs can relay messages to each other across the country, Pongo and Missis track them down to &quot;Hell Hall&quot;, the ancestral home of the de Vil family in Suffolk. Pongo and Missis try to tell their owners the word &quot;Suffolk&quot;, but they cannot make the &quot;S&quot; sound. The dogs decide to find the puppies themselves, leaving Perdita to look after the Dearlys. After a journey across the English countryside, with food and accommodation along the way arranged by dogs through the Barking Network, they meet the Colonel, an Old English Sheepdog. They get inside the mansion and discover that there are 97 puppies there, including Pongo and Missis&#x27; own 15.

Fearing police investigation, Cruella arrives and tells the Baddun brothers, whom she left in charge of Hell Hall, that they soon must slaughter and skin the dogs. Pongo and Missis realize they must rescue all of the puppies, who escape the night before Christmas Eve. One puppy, Cadpig, is a runt and too weak to walk the distance from Suffolk to London; Tommy, the Colonel&#x27;s two-year-old owner, willingly lends her his toy farm cart. One litter of eight puppies is just the right age for two of its members to fit the cart&#x27;s shaft, so they pull it in shifts.

The Dalmatians are nearly captured by Romani people, and one of the Barking Network dogs points out how conspicuous they are and helps them break into a chimney sweep&#x27;s establishment, where they roll in soot to disguise themselves. They travel across the fields and spend part of an evening in a cathedral; Cruella nearly overtakes them when they are forced to return to the road, but they hide in an empty removal van at the invitation of a Staffordshire terrier whose &quot;pets&quot; own the van and are returning to London that night.

Once the dogs arrive in London, Cruella&#x27;s Persian cat, who has been longing to avenge her many litters of kittens (all of which Cruella drowned), sees an opportunity and lets the dogs into Cruella&#x27;s house, where they destroy her husband&#x27;s entire stock of unpaid-for furs. The Dalmatians then return to the Dearlys&#x27; house. Pongo and Missis bark until Mr. Dearly opens the door, whereupon the whole mass of puppies streams inside and rolls on the carpet to remove the soot from their coats. The Dearlys recognize them and send out for steaks to feed them. The litter that pulled Cadpig&#x27;s cart are proven to be Perdita&#x27;s litter by Prince. Mr. Dearly finds out where the puppies had been when he discovers a label on the toy cart, which contains Tommy&#x27;s name and address. The Dearlys also place advertisements seeking the owners of the other puppies, but it turns out that they had all been bought, rather than stolen as the Dearlys&#x27; were. Perdita&#x27;s former owner, who never really cared for her, is happy to sell her to the Dearlys upon hearing the story.

Cruella&#x27;s now-homeless cat drops by (and is invited to stay) with the news that the destruction of Mr de Vil&#x27;s fur business has forced Cruella to leave the country and put Hell Hall up for sale. When the Dearlys visit Suffolk to return Tommy&#x27;s cart, they realize that, with 97 puppies and three adult Dalmatians, a larger home would be a good idea, so Mr. Dearly buys the hall with money he has been given by the government for sorting out another tax problem. He proposes to use it to start a &quot;dynasty of Dalmatians&quot; (and a &quot;dynasty of Dearlys&quot; to take care of them). Finally, Perdita&#x27;s lost love, Prince, turns up. His owners see his love for Perdita, and allow him to stay with the Dearlys and become their &quot;one hundred and oneth&quot; Dalmatian.

==Adaptations==

Disney adapted the novel into an animated film, released to cinemas on 25 January 1961 as &quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&quot;. It became the tenth highest-grossing film of 1961, and one of the studio&#x27;s most popular films of the decade. It was re-issued to cinemas four times, in 1969, 1979, 1985 and 1991. The 1991 reissue was the twentieth highest earning film of the year for domestic earnings. It was remade into a live action film in 1996.

In both the live-action and animated adaptations, there is only one nanny, Missis and Perdita are combined into one character, and other characters (such as many of the other dogs, Prince, Tommy, Cruella&#x27;s cat, and Cruella&#x27;s husband) were omitted. In the animated film, Pongo and Missis&#x27; owners&#x27; last names were changed to &quot;Radcliffe&quot; from &quot;Dearly&quot;, and in the live-action film, Cruella (portrayed by Glenn Close) appears as the spoiled magnate of an haute couture fashion house, &quot;House of DeVil&quot;. Disney kept the book&#x27;s characters Horace and Jasper Baddun in both versions, but represented them as the thieves hired by Cruella to steal Pongo and Missis&#x27; puppies. In the novel, Horace is named Saul, and they are merely caretakers, the puppies having been stolen by hired professional thieves some days before.
Disney later created an animated television series starring three of the puppies (Lucky, Rolly and Cadpig), and a second series that stars mostly descendants of Pongo and Perdita. Disney also released a sequel film for each of their film versions (&quot;One Hundred and One Dalmatians II&quot; and &quot;102 Dalmatians&quot;), but both were largely criticized for poor story and lack of originality. In 2021, Disney released a live-action reboot of the franchise, titled &quot;Cruella&quot;, which revolves around the origin of the title character and her partnership with Jasper and Horace.

The novel has been adapted for the stage by Debbie Isitt for the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry in 2000 (followed by productions at the Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton in 2007 and Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 2017), by Bryony Lavery for the Chichester Youth Theatre in 2014 and was devised by the company (directed by Sally Cookson) for Tobacco Factory Theatres in 2014. The novel was also adapted into a 2009 musical which opened in Minneapolis prior to a US tour. Another stage musical adaptation was due to open at Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in 2020, before being postponed twice to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 1996, the BBC adapted Dodie Smith&#x27;s novel into a full-cast musical audio dramatization, starring Patricia Hodge as Cruella. This version is very faithful to the source material, in that it has all the characters, but events are slightly changed – Cruella&#x27;s husband argues with her more than in the novel, and they do not leave London after the destruction of the fur stocks, nor do the Dearlys ever find out she was the mastermind. Furthermore, Perdita and Prince&#x27;s story is greatly abridged, Mrs. Willow helps the Colonel attack the Badduns to prevent them following the Dalmatians, and the White Cat does not join the family until after the move to Suffolk. Amazon Audible later released this production as an Audiobook, available for streaming online or through the app.

==Reception==
The book gained a positive response from critics.

The British writer Siobhan Dowd has cited the thieving Romani characters in the book as one example of a long history of anti-Romani stereotypes in English literature.

<doc id="179863" wikidata="Q488130" url="?curid=179863" title="Climate of Antarctica">
<text>The climate of [[Antarctica]] is the coldest on Earth. The continent is also extremely dry (it is a desert), averaging of precipitation per year. Snow rarely melts on most parts of the continent, and, after being compressed, becomes the glacier ice that makes up the ice sheet. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, because of the katabatic winds. Most of Antarctica has an ice-cap climate (Köppen classification &quot;EF&quot;) with extremely cold and dry weather.

==Temperature==
The highest temperature ever recorded on Antarctica was recorded at Signy Research Station, Signy Island on 30 January 1982. 

The highest temperature on the Antarctic mainland was at the Esperanza Base (Argentina) on 6 February 2020.
 The lowest air temperature record, the lowest reliably measured temperature on Antarctica was set on 21 July 1983, when a temperature of was observed at Vostok Station. For comparison, this is colder than subliming dry ice (at sea level pressure). The elevation of the location is .

Satellite measurements have identified even lower ground temperatures, with having been observed at the cloud-free East Antarctic Plateau on 10 August 2010.

The lowest recorded temperature of any location on Earth&#x27;s surface at was revised with new data in 2018 in nearly 100 locations, ranging from to . This unnamed part of the Antarctic plateau, between Dome A and Dome F, was measured on 10 August 2010, and the temperature was deduced from radiance measured by the Landsat 8 and other satellites. It was discovered during a National Snow and Ice Data Center review of stored data in December 2013 but revised by researchers on 25 June 2018. This temperature is not directly comparable to the reading quoted above, since it is a skin temperature deduced from satellite-measured upwelling radiance, rather than a thermometer-measured temperature of the air above the ground surface.

The mean annual temperature of the interior is . The coast is warmer; on the coast Antarctic average temperatures are around (in the warmest parts of Antarctica) and in the elevated inland they average about in Vostok.
Monthly means at McMurdo Station range from in August to in January.
At the South Pole, the highest temperature ever recorded was on 25 December 2011. Along the Antarctic Peninsula, temperatures as high as have been recorded, though the summer temperature is below most of the time. Severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean. East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation. The Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate. Higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing.

==Precipitation==
The total precipitation on Antarctica, averaged over the entire continent, is about per year (Vaughan et al., &quot;J. Clim.&quot;, 1999). The actual rates vary widely, from high values over the Peninsula ( a year) to very low values (as little as in the high interior (Bromwich, &quot;Reviews of Geophysics&quot;, 1988). Areas that receive less than of precipitation per year are classified as deserts. Almost all Antarctic precipitation falls as snow. Rainfall is rare and mainly occurs during the summer in coastal areas and surrounding islands. Note that the quoted precipitation is a measure of its equivalence to water, rather than being the actual depth of snow. The air in Antarctica is also very dry. The low temperatures result in a very low absolute humidity, which means that dry skin and cracked lips are a continual problem for scientists and expeditioners working on the continent.

==Weather condition classification==

The weather in Antarctica can be highly variable, and the weather conditions can often change dramatically in short periods of time. There are various classifications for describing weather conditions in Antarctica; restrictions given to workers during the different conditions vary by station and nation.

==Ice cover==
Nearly all of Antarctica is covered by a sheet of ice that is, on average, at least thick. Antarctica contains 90% of the world&#x27;s ice and more than 70% of its fresh water. If all the land-ice covering Antarctica were to melt—around of ice—the seas would rise by over . The Antarctic is so cold that even with increases of a few degrees, temperatures would generally remain below the melting point of ice. Higher temperatures are expected to lead to more precipitation, which takes the form of snow. This would increase the amount of ice in Antarctica, offsetting approximately one third of the expected sea level rise from thermal expansion of the oceans.
During a recent decade, East Antarctica thickened at an average rate of about per year while West Antarctica showed an overall thinning of per year. For the contribution of Antarctica to present and future sea level change, see sea level rise. Because ice flows, albeit slowly, the ice within the ice sheet is younger than the age of the sheet itself.

===Ice shelves===

About 75% of the coastline of Antarctica is ice shelf. The majority of ice shelf consists of floating ice, and a lesser amount consists of glaciers that move slowly from the land mass into the sea. Ice shelves lose mass through breakup of glacial ice (calving), or basal melting due to warm ocean water under the ice.

Melting or breakup of floating shelf ice does not directly affect global sea levels; however, ice shelves have a buttressing effect on the ice flow behind them. If ice shelves break up, the ice flow behind them may accelerate, resulting in increasing melt of the Antarctic ice sheet and an increasing contribution to sea level rise.

Known changes in coastline ice around the Antarctic Peninsula:
* 1936–1989: Wordie Ice Shelf significantly reduced in size.
* 1995: Ice in the Prince Gustav Channel disintegrated.
* Parts of the Larsen Ice Shelf broke up in recent decades.
** 1995: The Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated in January 1995.
** 2001: of the Larsen B ice shelf disintegrated in February 2001. It had been gradually retreating before the breakup event.
** 2015: A study concluded that the remaining &quot;Larsen B&quot; ice-shelf will disintegrate by the end of the decade, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area.

The George VI Ice Shelf, which may be on the brink of instability, has probably existed for approximately 8,000 years, after melting 1,500 years earlier. Warm ocean currents may have been the cause of the melting. Not only are the ice sheets losing mass, they are losing mass at an accelerating rate.

<text>Texas German (, ) is a group of German language dialects spoken by descendants of mid-19th century German settlers, Texas Germans. They settled the Texas German Country, running from Houston to the Hills Region, and founded the towns of Bulverde, New Braunfels, Fredericksburg, Boerne, Pflugerville, Walburg and Comfort in the Texas Hill Country; Muenster in North Texas; and Schulenburg, Brenham, Industry, New Ulm and Weimar in East Texas.

== History and documentation ==

While most heritage languages in the United States die out by the third generation, Texas German is unusual in that most German Texans continued to speak German in their homes and communities for several generations after settling in the state. The State of Texas recognized German as having equal status to Spanish from 1846 up until World War I. Afterwards, Texas schools mandated English-only instruction, and required children to learn English in school regardless of what language they spoke at home. Due to the assimilation of these communities and strong anti-German sentiment during both World War I and World War II, Texas German speakers decided to stop transmitting the language to their children, and shifted towards speaking only English.

Currently, Dr. Hans Boas at the University of Texas is recording and studying the dialect, building on research originally performed by Dr. Glenn Gilbert of Southern Illinois University Carbondale in the 1960s.

Boas&#x27; book on the language, &quot;The Life and Death of Texas German&quot;, describes the German dialects which may have been the source of the language spoken in Texas.

A short documentary project named &quot;All Güt Things&quot; was produced about Texas German in 2016.

An episode with the title &quot;Texas German&quot; was published on the podcast Yellow of the Egg in 2022, where Dr. Hans C. Boas (Director of the Texas German Dialect Project) was a guest.

== Current distribution and population ==
As of the U.S. 2000 Census, some 1,035 people report speaking German at home in Fredericksburg, the town with the largest community of Texas German speakers, representing 12.48% of the total population, 840 in New Braunfels, 150 in Schulenburg, 85 in Stonewall, 70 in Boerne, 65 in Harper, 45 in Comfort and 19 in Weimar, all of which except for Schulenburg and Weimar, lie in the traditional Texas German heartland of the Hill Country. Gillespie County, with the communities of Fredericksburg, Harper, Stonewall, and Luckenbach, has a German-speaking population of 2,270, 11.51% of the county&#x27;s total. In all, 82,100 German-speakers reside in the state of Texas, including European German speakers.

== Comparisons with German and English ==
Texas German is adapted to U.S. measurement and legal terminologies. Standard American German words typically were invented, introduced from other German dialects of the region, or English loanwords were introduced for words not present in 19th-century German. Dialect leveling is also found throughout many of the American German dialects including Texas German. In some cases, these new words also exist in modern Standard German, but with a different meaning. For instance, the word (used for &quot;airplane&quot;) means airship in Standard German.

<text>Hutterite German (German: &quot;Hutterisch&quot;) is an Upper German dialect of the Bavarian variety of the German language, which is spoken by Hutterite communities in Canada and the United States. Hutterite is also called Tirolean, but this is an anachronism.

==Distribution and literacy==
Hutterite is spoken in the US states of Washington, Montana, North and South Dakota, Minnesota and Oregon; and in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Its speakers belong to the &quot;Schmiedleit&quot;, &quot;Lehrerleit&quot;, and &quot;Dariusleit&quot; Hutterite groups, but there is also a small number of speakers among the older generations of &quot;Prairieleit&quot; (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). The Schmiedleit, Lehrerleit, and Dariusleit each have their own distinct dialects. Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies learn and speak Hutterite German before learning English, the standard language of the surrounding areas.

As of 2003, there are about 34,000 speakers in the world, 85% of them living in 333 communities in Canada and the remaining 15% in 123 communities in the US. Canadian adults are generally literate in Early New High German (also called &quot;Biblical German&quot;, and the predecessor to Standard German used by Martin Luther) that they employ as the written form for Scriptures while Standard German is used in the US for religious activities. Children learn English at school; Canadian Hutterites have a functional knowledge of English. Hutterite is for the most part an unwritten language, though in August 2006 Hutterite author Linda Maendel released a children&#x27;s story titled &quot;Lindas glücklicher Tag&quot; (Linda&#x27;s Happy Day) in which all the dialogue is written in the dialect. Maendel is also working on a series of biblical stories with Wycliff Bible translators.

==History and related languages==
Hutterite German is a koiné language originally based on the Bavarian dialects spoken in Tyrol, home of Jacob Hutter and many early Hutterites, but it shifted its base to Carinthia dialects in the mid-18th century when so-called &quot;Landler&quot;, Crypto-Protestants from Carinthia, were forced by empress Maria Theresia to resettle to Transylvania. A larger group of them joined the scattered remnants of the Hutterites who had been able to settle in Transylvania where there was more religious tolerance than in other parts of the Habsburg monarchy. This tolerance for different Christian groups emerged when Transylvania was ruled by the Ottoman Empire whose rulers did not care about theological differences among the &quot;infidels&quot; they ruled.

Hutterite German is only about 50% intelligible to a speaker of Pennsylvania Dutch, as the latter variant is based on dialects spoken around the Electoral Palatinate. Hutterite German therefore belongs to the Southern Bavarian dialect group which is spoken in the southern parts of Bavaria and Austria except for the westernmost part (Vorarlberg).

The language has adopted a limited number of Russian and also many English loan words, which are the result of Hutterite migrations into Eastern Europe and now North America. The core vocabulary is still almost exclusively of German origin.

<text>Edward Neil Anthony Hannon (born 7 November 1970) is a singer and songwriter from Northern Ireland. He is the founder and frontman of the chamber pop group the Divine Comedy, and is the band&#x27;s only constant member since its inception in 1989. Hannon wrote the theme tunes for the television sitcoms &quot;Father Ted&quot; and &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, as well as the original songs for the musical film &quot;Wonka&quot; (2023).

==Early life and education==
Hannon was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, the son of Brian Hannon, a Church of Ireland minister in the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe and later Bishop of Clogher. He spent some of his youth in Fivemiletown before moving with his family to Enniskillen, in County Fermanagh, in 1982. While there, he attended Portora Royal School.

Hannon enjoyed synthesizer-based music as a youngster: he has identified the Human League and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) as &quot;the first music that really excited [him]&quot;. In the late 1980s he developed a fondness of the electric guitar, becoming an &quot;indie kid&quot;.

==Career==
Hannon is founder and mainstay of the Divine Comedy, a band which achieved their biggest commercial success in the mid- to late-1990s with the albums &quot;Casanova&quot; (1996), &quot;A Short Album About Love&quot; (1997), and &quot;Fin de Siècle&quot; (1998). Hannon continues to release albums under the Divine Comedy name, the most recent being &quot;Office Politics&quot; (2019). In 2000, he and Joby Talbot contributed four tracks to Ute Lemper&#x27;s collaboration album, &quot;Punishing Kiss&quot;.

Hannon composed the theme music for the sitcoms &quot;Father Ted&quot; and &quot;The IT Crowd&quot;, the former theme composed for the show and later reworked into &quot;Songs of Love&quot;, a track on the Divine Comedy&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Casanova&quot;. Both shows were created or co-created by Graham Linehan. For the &quot;Father Ted&quot; episode, &quot;A Song for Europe&quot;, Hannon co-wrote and sang &quot;My Lovely Horse&quot;, the song Ted and Dougal enter in Eurosong (a parody of the Eurovision Song Contest). For the same episode, Hannon wrote &quot;The Miracle Is Mine&quot;, the &#x27;typical&#x27; Eurovision ballad sung by Ted&#x27;s nemesis, Father Dick Byrne. A dream sequence in the episode shows Ted and Dougal in the song&#x27;s pop video, with Hannon providing vocals. Hannon also wrote and performed &quot;My Lovely Mayo Mammy&quot;, sung by Eoin McLove in the episode &quot;Night of the Nearly Dead&quot;, and wrote &quot;Big Men in Frocks&quot;, sung by Niamh Connolly (played by Clare Grogan) in &quot;Rock-a-Hula Ted&quot;. When a raffle is held in order to raise funds to repair the roof of the parochial house, the Kraftwerk-esque quartet of priests enlisted to perform play an electronic piece of music composed and performed by him. Both of the advertisements for telephone numbers; in &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; (the new emergency number) and &quot;Father Ted&quot; (Priest Chatback) have jingles composed by Hannon. In the episode &quot;A Christmassy Ted&quot;, his name is mentioned by Mrs Doyle while she attempts to guess that of the mysterious guest.

In 2004, Hannon performed alongside the Ulster Orchestra for the opening event of the Belfast Festival at Queen&#x27;s. In 2005, he contributed vocals to Talbot&#x27;s soundtrack for the movie version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

In 2006, it was announced that Hannon was to lend vocals to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; soundtrack CD release, recording two songs – &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Roam&quot;, for the 2006 Christmas special &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot;; and a new version of &quot;Song for Ten&quot;, which originally appeared in 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. On 12 January 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; website&#x27;s &quot;Media Monkey&quot; diary column reported that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans from the discussion forum on the fan website Outpost Gallifrey were attempting to organise mass downloads of the Hannon-sung &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Roam&quot;, which was available as a single release in the UK iTunes Store. This was in order to attempt to exploit the new UK Singles Chart download rules, and get the song featured in the Top 40 releases.

The same year, Hannon sang and wrote the lyrics for the song &quot;Somewhere Between Waking and Sleeping&quot; on the Air album &quot;Pocket Symphony&quot;, released in the United States on 6 March 2007. This song had been originally written for and sung by Charlotte Gainsbourg on her 2006 album &quot;5:55&quot;. Though it was not included on its 2006 European release, it was added as a bonus track to its American release on 24 April 2007.

Hannon won the 2007 Choice Music Prize for his 2006 album, &quot;Victory for the Comic Muse&quot;. It was announced the following day that he had left EMI by &#x27;mutual consent&#x27;. When the band Keane played at the O2 Arena in London that July, &quot;A Bad Dream&quot; was introduced by Hannon, who read the poem &quot;An Irish Airman Foresees His Death&quot; by W. B. Yeats, upon which the song is based.

In 2009, Hannon collaborated with Thomas Walsh from the Irish band Pugwash to create a cricket-themed pop album, under the name the Duckworth Lewis Method. The first single, &quot;The Age of Revolution&quot;, was released in June 2009, and was followed by an eponymous full-length album the week after. The group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sticky Wickets&quot;, came out in 2013.

Hannon composed the music for a stage adaptation of Arthur Ransome&#x27;s novel &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; (1930), which premiered in December 2010 at the Bristol Old Vic, with book and lyrics by Helen Edmundson. A new Divine Comedy album, &quot;Bang Goes the Knighthood&quot;, was released in May 2010.

On 20 April 2012, Hannon&#x27;s first opera commission, &quot;Sevastopol&quot;, was performed by the Royal Opera House in London. The piece was part of a program called OperaShots, which invites musicians not typically working within the opera medium to create an opera, and was based upon Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Sevastopol Sketches&quot;. Hannon&#x27;s second opera for which he composed the music, &quot;In May&quot; (with book by Frank Alva Buecheler and English translations by Tim Clarke), premiered at Lancaster University&#x27;s Nuffield Theatre in May 2013.

In 2013, Hannon was commissioned by the Southbank Centre to compose a piece for the Royal Festival Hall&#x27;s refurbished organ: &quot;To Our Fathers in Distress&quot;, &quot;a kind of oratorio&quot; for chorus, strings and organ, premiered at the Hall in London on 22 March 2014, as part of the Pull Out All the Stop Festival, and was inspired by Hannon&#x27;s father, the Rt Rev Brian Hannon, who had suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease before his death in 2022. In 2015, Neil won the 2015 Legend Award from the Oh Yeah organisation in Belfast.

Hannon wrote the soundtrack and songs for the Irish sci-fi film &quot;LOLA&quot;, for which he won an IFTA Award at the 2024 IFTAs.

Hannon wrote the songs for the 2023 musical film &quot;Wonka&quot;.

On 28 January 2024 Hannon was the guest of Michael Berkeley on the BBC Radio 3 programme &quot;Private Passions&quot;. His choices included Chopin&#x27;s Nocturne in E flat major, Op 9, No. 2, Ravel&#x27;s String Quartet in F major and &quot;Montague Terrace (In Blue)&quot; by Scott Walker.

==Personal life==
Since 2009 (wed Jan 2023), Hannon&#x27;s partner has been Irish musician Cathy Davey. The couple live in County Kildare. He was previously married to Orla Little, with whom he has a daughter, born about 2002. With Davey, Hannon is a patron of the Irish animal charity My Lovely Horse Rescue, named after the &quot;Father Ted&quot; Eurovision song for which he wrote the music.

Politically, Hannon describes himself as being &quot;a thoroughly leftie, &quot;Guardian&quot;-reading chap, but of the champagne socialist variety&quot;.

<doc id="179879" wikidata="Q362365" url="?curid=179879" title="Male dominance (BDSM)">
<text>Male dominance, or maledom is a BDSM practice where the dominant partner is male. A sexually dominant male in BDSM practices is also known as a maledom. Maledoms can be professional as well as non-professional. The term ProDom is used for a professional male dominant who earns money by working as a professional dominant as part of the sex industry. A maledom who role-plays a paternal figure is also known as Daddy Dom.

Practices of domination common to many BDSM and various other sexual relationships are also prevalent, such as various forms of body worship including cock and ball worship, ass worship and foot worship, fellatio, tease and denial, corporal punishment including spanking, caning and whipping, breast torture, pussy torture, orgasm denial, verbal humiliation, face slapping, hair pulling, wax play, spitting, golden showers, forced orgasm, &quot;forced&quot; chastity, and irrumatio. Male dominance may also take place in the form of clothed male, naked female.

Male dominants are often referred to as dom, master, owner, sir, taskmaster, corporalist, boss or top. For some people, male dominance is only used in sexual and intimate scenarios, but for others male dominance can be included in 24/7 BDSM relationships.

A 1995 study indicated that 71% of heterosexual males preferred a dominant-initiator role, but a more recent study in Germany from 2015 indicates that 29.5% of men who are active in BDSM express a preference for a dominant role, 24% consider themselves to be switches and 46.6% of men prefer the submissive role. Another survey in Colorado from 2017, challenges these conclusions, and indicates that men tend to self-identify as Dominant, Master, Top, or Sadist (DMTS) and always perform dominant roles.

==Popular culture==
Maledom scenarios are common in BDSM fiction, including works such as the &quot;Story of O&quot; and the works of John Norman and Adrian Hunter. Maledom is a growing adult film genre.

Maledom fiction began with the works of the Marquis de Sade who wrote about sexual scenarios in which men tortured others, primarily women. The term &quot;sadism&quot; is derived from de Sade&#x27;s name. Since then, the lifestyle around male dominance has grown into a large part of the BDSM scene.

The &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; novel series by E. L. James is associated with the cultural mainstreaming and normalising of BDSM. The books achieved great commercial success, with the first volume selling over 100 million copies worldwide.

<doc id="179890" wikidata="Q1044876" url="?curid=179890" title="Sibe people">
<text>The Sibe are a Tungusic-speaking East Asian ethnic group living mostly in Xinjiang, Jilin and Shenyang in Liaoning. The Sibe form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by China, and had a recorded population of 190,481 in the 2010 Chinese Census, comprising just over 0.014% of China&#x27;s total population.

==Nomenclature==
The Sibe are known by several variations of their name. The self-appellation of the Sibe people is pronounced &quot;Śivə&quot;, the official Chinese term is &quot;Xibo&quot;, in Russian literature the terms Сибинцы (sibintsy) and Шибинцы (shibintsy) are used, while in English works the name &quot;Sibe&quot; has been established, which corresponds to the written form.

==History==

According to the Russian scholar Elena P. Lebedeva, the Sibe people originated as a southern, Tungusic-speaking offshoot of the ancient Shiwei people. They lived in small town-like settlements, a portion of them nomadic, in the Songyuan and Qiqihar areas of what is now Jilin.

When the Buyeo kingdom was conquered by the Xianbei in 286 AD, the southern Shiwei started practicing agriculture. Some historians have theorized that the Xianbei were the direct progenitors of the Sibe, a theory described by some as politically motivated. Pamela Kyle Crossley writes the Xianbei might have undergone a language shift from an earlier Turkic or proto-Mongolian language to a Tungusic one. However, the name &quot;Sibe&quot; was not used in historical records during Xianbei times.

The Han dynasty, Cao Wei and the Jin dynasty (266–420) at times controlled the Sibe until the advent of the Göktürks, who accorded the Sibe lower status than did the Chinese dynasties. At the height of their territorial dispersion, the Sibe lived in an area bounded by Jilin to the east, Hulunbuir to the west, the Nen River to the north and the Liao River to the south. After the fall of the Liao dynasty, the Sibe became vassals of the Khorchin Mongols who moved to the Nen and Songhua river valleys in 1438 after the Khorchin were defeated by the Oirats.

Nurhaci, the first prominent figure of the Manchu people, routed the Sibe during the battle of Gure in 1593 on his way to founding the Qing dynasty of China. From that point, the Qing contracted the Sibe for logistical support against the Russian Empire&#x27;s expansionism on China&#x27;s northern border. Crossley claims that the Sibe were so &quot;well known to Russians moving toward the Pacific&quot; that the Russians named Siberia after them. In 1692, the Khorchin dedicated the Sibe, the Gūwalca and the Daur to the Kangxi Emperor in exchange for silver. The Sibe were incorporated into the Eight Banners and were stationed in Qiqihar and other cities in Northeast China.

In 1700, some 20,000 Qiqihar Sibes were resettled in Hohhot (modern Inner Mongolia); 36,000 Songyuan Sibes were resettled in Shenyang, Liaoning. The relocation of the Sibe from Qiqihar is believed by Gorelova to be linked to the Qing&#x27;s complete annihilation of the Manchu clan Hoifan (Hoifa) in 1697 and the Manchu tribe Ula in 1703 after they revolted against the Qing. According to Jerry Norman, after a revolt by the Qiqihar Sibes in 1764, the Qianlong Emperor ordered an 800-man military escort to transfer 18,000 Sibe to the Ili River of Dzungaria.

In Ili, the Xinjiang Sibe built Buddhist monasteries and cultivated vegetables, tobacco and poppies. The Sibe population declined after the Qing used them to suppress the Dungan Revolt (1862–77) by the Hui and to fight against the Russian occupation of Ili during the revolt. The scarcity of provisions in Ili became such that the Governor at last saw himself obliged to dismiss his last auxiliaries, the Thagor Kalmuks. In the meantime both Solons and Sibos were being attacked and plundered and were obliged to make peace with the insurgents, so that only Ili, Khorgos, Losigun and Suidun, remained in the hands of the Mantchus. Ili was now entirely surrounded and it was resolved to reduce it by famine. The situation there was indeed frightful; all the provisions had been exhausted and the only food was horses, dogs and cats. Typhus so raged that from 50 to 100 men died daily.

During the Republic of China (1912–49) period, many northeastern Sibe joined anti-Japanese volunteer armies, while northwestern Sibe fought against the Kuomintang during the Ili Rebellion. After the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949 established the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), large-scale educational and hygiene campaigns increased Sibe literacy and resulted in the eradication of Qapqal disease (a form of type A botulism).

In 1954, the PRC established the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County to replace Ningxi County in Xinjiang, in the group&#x27;s area of highest ethnic concentration.

==Culture==

Most historical analyses indicate that the Sibe people were never treated as part of the Manchu proper, nor do they ever perceive themselves as being the same as the Manchu people. The Sibe garrisons were administered separately from those of the Manchu and did not enjoy the same rights as them. The Sibe soldiers had to earn their living by squatting on land to become self-sufficient, while the Manchu garrisons were supplied by the Qing state. Possibly due to the unequal administrative treatment in the history, alongside their late incorporation into the Eight Banners, there is both a Sibe self-perception and state recognition of the Sibe people in more recent times as a national minority that is distinct from the Manchu.

Historical religions of the Sibe included shamanism and Buddhism. Customary Sibe attire included short buttoned jackets and trousers for men and close-fitting, long and lace-trimmed gowns for women. Arranged marriage was common and women had low social status, including no right to inherit property. Nowadays almost all the Sibe wear modern clothing and the traditional clothing is worn by elders during festivals. Traditionally, the Sibe were divided into many &quot;hala&quot;, male-led clans consisting of people who shared the same surname. Until modern times, the dwellings of the Sibe housed up to three different generations from the same family, since it was believed that while the father was alive no son could break the family clan by leaving the house.

The Sibe in Northeast China speak Mandarin Chinese as their first language. In some Sibe communities in Northeast China, women are not allowed to live with men before formal marriage. During this time, the man must formally propose and express his intention to marry through specific acts and ceremonies. Only after the woman accepts the proposal and the marriage is finalized can she move into the man&#x27;s home. In Xinjiang, descendants of the Qing dynasty military garrison speak the Xibe language, a Southern Tungusic language that underwent morphophonological changes and the adoption of loanwords from languages spoken in Xinjiang including Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Uyghur, and Kazakh.

The different ethnicities of Northern Xinjiang have shared musical culture and adopted elements from each other&#x27;s music.

== Distribution ==
According to the 2010 Chinese Census, there were 190,481 Sibe people in China: 99,571 males and 90,910 females. The largest Sibe population within China was in the province of Liaoning, home to 132,431 Sibe people, 69.52% of all Sibe people in China, but just 0.30% of Liaoning&#x27;s total population. The autonomous region of Xinjiang is also home to a sizable number of Sibe people: 34,399 in total, accounting for 18.06% of all Sibe people in China, and 0.16% of Xinjiang&#x27;s total population. Outside of these two, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia have the largest Sibe populations, totaling 7,608, 3,113, and 3,000, respectively.
=== Xinjiang ===
Approximately 43,000 Sibe people live in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, of which, approximately 34,000 live in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, where the Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County is located. As of 2018, 19,984 Sibe people live in the autonomous county, comprising 10.28% of its total population, which is dominated by larger groups, such as the Han Chinese, Uyghurs, and Kazakhs. In 2015, 20,426 Sibe people lived in the autonomous county, comprising 10.38% of its total population.

<text>Robert Adrian de Jauralde Hart (1 April 1913 – 7 March 2000) was an English pioneer of forest gardening in temperate zones. He created a model forest garden from a 0.12 acre (500 m²) orchard on his farm. He credits the inspiration for his work to an article by James Sholto Douglas, which was in turn inspired by the work of Toyohiko Kagawa.

==Early life==

Hart, son of a lawyer father and a soprano mother, was born in London and educated at Westminster School, after which he was employed at Reuters news agency in charge of special Indian mails, work which involved compiling digests of weekly articles by Mahatma Gandhi, whose nonviolence philosophy he took on board.

At the outbreak of World War II he considered registering as a conscientious objector but changed mind following retreat from Dunkirk in 1940 and enlisted in the Corps of Military Police, later transferring to the Intelligence Corps to work in code-breaking.

After demobilisation, he was a dairy farmer in Norfolk and Somerset before moving to Shropshire where he took on a smallholding on Wenlock Edge.

==Wenlock Edge==

Robert Hart began with a smallholding called Highwood Hill farm at Wenlock Edge. His intention was to provide a healthy and therapeutic environment for himself and his brother Lacon, who was born with severe learning disabilities.

Hart though soon discovered that maintaining large annual vegetable beds, rearing livestock and taking care of an orchard were tasks beyond his strength. However, he also observed that a small bed of perennial vegetables and herbs he had planted was looking after itself with little or no intervention. Furthermore, these plants provided interesting and unusual additions to the diet, and seemed to promote health and vigour in both body and mind.

==Forest garden project==
Noting the maxim of Hippocrates to &quot;make food your medicine and medicine your food&quot;, Hart adopted a vegan, 90% raw food diet. The three main products from a forest garden are fruit, nuts and green leafy vegetables. Hart&#x27;s forest garden at Wenlock Edge was a vegan organic food production system.

He also began to examine the interactions and relationships that take place between plants in natural systems, particularly in woodland, the climax ecosystem of a cool temperate region such as the British Isles. This led him to evolve the agroforestry concept of the &quot;Forest Garden&quot;: Based on the observation that the natural forest can be divided into distinct layers or &#x27;storeys&#x27;, he developed an existing small orchard of apples and pears into an edible landscape consisting of seven dimensions;

#A &#x27;canopy&#x27; layer consisting of the original mature fruit trees.
#A &#x27;low-tree layer&#x27; of smaller nut and fruit trees on dwarfing root stocks.
#A &#x27;shrub layer&#x27; of fruit bushes such as currants and berries.
#A &#x27;herbaceous layer&#x27; of perennial vegetables and herbs.
#A &#x27;ground cover&#x27; layer of edible plants that spread horizontally.
#A &#x27;rhizosphere&#x27; or &#x27;underground&#x27; dimension of plants grown for their roots and tubers.
#A vertical &#x27;layer&#x27; of vines and climbers.

Hart had a vision for the spread of the forest garden throughout even the most heavily built up areas, as he explains:

==Later life==

Hart died in March 2000 aged 86 and is buried in St Peter&#x27;s churchyard at Rushbury, Shropshire.

<text>An alter ego (Latin for &quot;other I&quot;) means an alternate self, which is believed to be distinct from a person&#x27;s normal or true original personality. Finding one&#x27;s alter ego will require finding one&#x27;s other self, one with a different personality. Additionally, the altered states of the ego may themselves be referred to as &quot;alterations&quot;. 

A distinct meaning of &quot;alter ego&quot; is found in the literary analysis used when referring to fictional literature and other narrative forms, describing a key character in a story who is perceived to be intentionally representative of the work&#x27;s author (or creator), by oblique similarities, in terms of psychology, behavior speech, or thoughts, often used to convey the author&#x27;s thoughts. The term is also sometimes, but less frequently, used to designate a hypothetical &quot;twin&quot; or &quot;best friend&quot; to a character in a story. Similarly, the term &quot;alter ego&quot; may be applied to the role or persona taken on by an actor or by other types of performers.

== Origin ==
Cicero coined the term as part of his philosophical construct in 1st-century Rome, but he described it as &quot;a second self, a trusted friend&quot;.

The existence of &quot;another self&quot; was first fully recognized in the 18th century, when Anton Mesmer and his followers used hypnosis to separate the alter ego. These experiments showed a behavior pattern that was distinct from the personality of the individual when he was in the waking state compared with when he was under hypnosis. Another character had developed in the altered state of consciousness but in the same body.

Sigmund Freud, throughout his career, would appeal to such instances of dual consciousness to support his thesis of the unconscious. He considered that &quot;We may most aptly describe them as cases of a splitting of the mental activities into two groups, and say that the same consciousness turns to one or the other of these groups alternately&quot;. Freud considered the roots of the phenomenon of the alter ego to be in the narcissistic stage of early childhood. Heinz Kohut would identify a specific need in that early phase for mirroring, by another which resulted later in what he called the &quot;twinship or alter ego transference&quot;.

==In popular culture and fiction==
*The title characters in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s thriller &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; represent an exploration of the concept that good and evil exist within one person, constantly at war. Edward Hyde represents the doctor&#x27;s other self, a psychopath who is unrestrained by the conventions of civilized society, and who shares a body with the doctor. The names (Jekyll and Hyde) since become synonymous with a split personality or an &quot;alter ego&quot; that can overpower the original self.
*In the novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, the main character Edmond Dantes, after escaping from the Chateau d&#x27;If, assumes three alter egos: the count of Monte Cristo, the Italian abbe called Giacomo Busoni, and the Englishman Lord Wilmore. In the novel, the Count of Monte Cristo rewards those who had been good to him while punishing those who contributed in one way or the other to his imprisonment. He leads M. Danglars to lose all his fortune, M. de Villefort to his madness, Fernand Mandego to commit suicide and others more to their fate.
*Norman Douglas in the late 1890s wrote a short story, &quot;The Familiar Spirit&quot;, about a man who became aware while drowning of a conformist second self – &quot;the presence within him of this Spirit, his &quot;alter ego&quot;, which is bent on crushing his ambition&quot;.
*Published in 1905, the Scarlet Pimpernel&#x27;s titular protagonist is the prototype hero with a secret identity. Sir Percy Blakeney leads a double life: He appears to be just a wealthy fop, but in reality he is the Scarlet Pimpernel, a formidable swordsman and a quick-thinking master of disguise and escape artist who establishes a network of supporters, The League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, that aids his endeavors. By drawing attention to his alter ego, Blakeney hides behind his public face of a thinking foppish playboy (similar to Batman, who hides himself as Bruce Wayne) 
*In comic books, superheroes and their secret identities are often considered the &quot;alter egos&quot;. The archetypal comic book hero, Superman, assumes the identity of the &quot;mild-mannered&quot; newspaper reporter Clark Kent to live among the citizens of Metropolis without arousing suspicion. &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; comic book series further complicates this theme, as Bruce Banner loses control to the Hyde-like Hulk whenever he becomes angry, yet also depends upon the Hulk&#x27;s superpowers to combat villains.
*In the film and novel &quot;Fight Club&quot;, the narrator has an alter ego he loses control of, Tyler Durden.
*In the Indian Malayalam film &quot;Ustaad&quot;, written by Ranjith and directed by Sibi Malayil, Mohanlal plays the character of Ustaad, the alter ego of the character Parameswaran.
*In Disney&#x27;s &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;, Miley Stewart (played by Miley Cyrus), leads the life of a high school student, and the life of teen pop sensation Hannah Montana allowing her to get the best of both worlds. Likewise, Miley&#x27;s friends, Lilly Truscott (played by Emily Osment) and Oliver Oken (played by Mitchel Musso), also lead the lives of high school students and are what make up Hannah&#x27;s entourage, Lola Luftnagle, and Mike Stanley III respectively.
* In &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, Vivian Darkbloom is the alter ego of Alison Dilaurentis.
*In &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Cornholio is Beavis&#x27;s alter ego.
*Several famous musicians have adopted alter egos over the years, usually to indicate a new creative direction or a deep dive into their emotions removed from their popular stage persona—notable examples being David Bowie (with Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane) and Prince (with Camille). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote Bowie&#x27;s invention of Ziggy Stardust was &quot;the alter ego that changed music forever and sent his career into orbit&quot;. Particularly during the 2000s, several big-name singers dedicated album eras to reveal their alter egos, including Janet Jackson with &quot;Damita Jo,&quot; Mariah Carey with &quot;The Emancipation of Mimi&quot;, and Beyoncé with &quot;I Am ... Sasha Fierce&quot;. Many rappers have also employed alter egos, notably Eminem (Slim Shady), Shock G (Humpty Hump), Nicki Minaj (Roman Zolanski), and Tyler, the Creator (Tyler Baudelaire), among others. The rapper MF DOOM used a lot of alter egos throughout his career, notably Viktor Vaughn and King Geedorah.
*Darth Vader is considered to be Anakin Skywalker&#x27;s alter ego following his fall to the dark side of The Force.
*In OMORI, the story revolves around a boy named SUNNY and his &quot;alter ego&quot; OMORI.
*In the 2023 Tamil Film &quot;Leo: Bloody Sweet&quot; actor Joseph Vijay plays the character Leo Das and his alter-ego Parthiban.
*The 2006 animated film Paprika features a psychologist named Atsuko and her dream-self, Paprika. 
* In the video game &quot;Elden Ring&quot;, one of the most important characters, &quot;Miquella the kind&quot; has an alter ego called &quot;St. Trina&quot;

== Etymology ==
The name Thrissur (Malayalam: തൃശ്ശൂർ) is a shortened form of the Malayalam word &quot;Thirusshivaperoor&quot; (meaning: Place of Lord Shiva&#x27;s Name). The name owes itself to the most prominent feature of the city, which is the Vadakkumnathan Temple, which has Shiva as its presiding deity. Thrissur was officially known by its anglicized name Trichur until 1990 when the government decided to replace it with its real Malayalam name. Thrissur was also known as &quot;Vrishabhadripuram&quot; (Kailasam of the South) in ancient days.

== History ==

The presence of numerous prehistoric megaliths and dolmens indicates that Thrissur has been occupied from at least 1000BCE to 500CE.
The Portuguese had naval influence in many parts of Kerala in the 16th century, including Thrissur. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Portuguese naval power was reduced and Dutch became the main naval power. With the help of the Dutch, the royal family of the Kingdom of Cochin recaptured Thrissur from the Zamorin of Calicut in 1710.

Thrissur rose to importance after Maharaja Sakthan Thampuran ascended the throne of the Kingdom of Cochin (1769–1805) and made Thrissur his capital. The Maharaja made the city into a major financial and commercial hub of South India, by inviting Syrian Christian families and Brahmins from adjoining areas.

During 1750–60 Hyder Ali, the Sultan of the powerful Kingdom of Mysore, conquered Thrissur, making it a tributary of Mysore. In 1786, the son of Tipu Sultan of Mysore led another invasion of Thrissur but retreated after the Srirangapattanam war. In the meantime, Rama Varma X, the successor of Sakthan Thampuran signed a treaty with the East India Company, transforming the state of Cochin into a British Protectorate.

The Indian independence movement gained momentum after a Committee was formed at the 1919 meeting of the Indian National Congress. The civil disobedience movement attracted many people in Thrissur in subsequent years, and Mahatma Gandhi visited the city in 1927 and 1934 to promote it.

R. K. Shanmukham Chetty, the controversial Diwan of Cochin Kingdom from 1935 to 1941, developed the city by constructing Thrissur Town Hall and Ramanilayam, buildings which remain important in Kerala politics. Other important civic buildings and infrastructure constructed around this time include the Municipal Corporation Building of Thrissur and the Swaraj Round.

<text>A persona (plural personae or personas) is a strategic mask of identity in public, the public image of one&#x27;s personality, the social role that one adopts, or simply a fictional character. It is also considered &quot;an intermediary between the individual and the institution.&quot;

Persona studies is an academic field developed by communication and media scholars. The term &quot;persona&quot; has been discussed by sociologists Robert Park and Erving Goffman in the 1950s. It is a tool to become persons by constructing the conception of our role and connecting the inner conception to the outer world as individuals. Yet, the terminology of identity and personae has been applied loosely and both imply the impressions of self and social performances in their works.

The word derives from Latin, where it originally referred to a theatrical mask. The usage of the word dates back to the beginnings of Latin civilization. The Latin word derived from the Etruscan word &quot;,&quot; with the same meaning, and that from the Greek (&quot;&quot;). It is the etymology of the word &quot;person,&quot; or &quot;parson&quot; in French. Latin etymologists explain that persona comes from &quot;per/sonare&quot; as &quot;the mask through which (per) resounds the voice (of the actor).&quot;

Its meaning in the latter Roman period changed to indicate a &quot;character&quot; of a theatrical performance or court of law, when it became apparent that different individuals could assume the same role and that legal attributes such as rights, powers, and duties followed the role. The same individuals as actors could play different roles, each with its own legal attributes, sometimes even in the same court appearance.

==In psychology==

According to Carl Jung and the Jungian psychology, the persona is also the mask or appearance one presents to the world. It may appear in dreams under various guises. People may choose to wear a social mask or use a persona to make themselves appear more socially desirable. This is used to impress potential partners or to make new friends. People can have multiple personas that they use in various situations; this can include work, being with friends, at home, etc. Depending on the individual&#x27;s circumstance, a persona which they consider stronger within their specific social situation can be created because they put a higher emphasis on social interactions. Jung warned about using personas too much, fearing that one might lose their own individuality to their persona. A study has shown that this can be true to an extent; when taking a private self-rating test, there is a high correlation between how a person rates themselves and how they present themselves in public. It is difficult to tell if people are accurately filling out the test or answering what they find desirable.

In a study written by Danielle Jackson, she argues that a person&#x27;s persona can range in healthiness. The more healthy a persona is, the more socially acceptable and consistent that person remains. However, once a person starts to believe they are their persona, it can have adverse effects on their personality. James Hillman believed that once a person loses their identity to a persona, they become an archetypal figure. By losing their &quot;ego&quot;, their persona becomes their personality in an archetypal form. However, when this occurs, the person becomes unstable and they are unable to act outside their formed persona.

==In literature==
In literature, the term generally refers to a character established by an author, one in whose voice all or part of a narrative takes place. Poets such as Robert Browning, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot are strongly associated with such narrative voices, as is the writer Luigi Pirandello. These writers understood the term slightly differently and derived its use and meaning from different traditions. Examples of Eliot&#x27;s personae were &quot;Prufrock&quot; and &quot;Sweeney&quot;. Pound developed such characters as Cino, Bertran de Born, Propertius, and Mauberley in response to figures in Browning’s dramatic monologues. Whereas Eliot used &quot;masks&quot; to distance himself from aspects of modern life which he found degrading and repulsive, Pound&#x27;s personae were often poets and could be considered in good part alter egos. For Pound, the personae were a way of working through a specific poetic problem. In this sense, the persona is a transparent mask, wearing the traits of two poets and responding to two situations, old and new, which are similar and overlapping.

In literary analysis, any narrative voice that speaks in the first person and appears to define a particular character is often referred to as a persona. It is contrasted with a third-person narrative voice, generally taken to be more objective and impersonal. There are borderline cases, such as the &quot;we&quot; that occurs late in Edwin Arlington Robinson&#x27;s poem and functions something like a chorus in a Greek tragedy, but in general any identifiable narrator whose point of view or manner of speaking clearly distinguishes them from the author is considered a literary persona.

In fan fiction and in online stories, the personas may especially reflect the authors&#x27; self-insertion.

==In music==
=== The concept of musical personae ===
The concept of personae in music was introduced by Edward T. Cone in his &quot;The Composer&#x27;s Voice&quot; (1974), which dealt with the relation between the lyrical self of a song&#x27;s lyrics and its composer. Performance studies scholar Philip Auslander includes further contextual frames, in which musical persona is the primary product of musical performances apart from the original text. Auslander argues that music is a primary social frame as a &quot;principle of organization which govern events.&quot; In addition, he categorizes three types of personae transformation: lateral moves within the same frame at a given moment; movements from one frame to another; and within a single frame that changes over time and hypothesizes that personae transformation could only happen when the genre framing changes. As a strategic formation of public identity in communities, musical personae describe how music moves through cultures. Persona maintains stability of performance with the expectation from the audience matching in musical presentation.

The concept of persona can also be used to refer to an instrumentalist, like a pianist and their playing style, although the term is more commonly used to refer to the voice and performance nuances of a vocalist in a studio album or in a live concert. In online spaces where personae are more visible, musical personae can be created through the flexible and fluid virtual bodies of avatars.

Usually, the performers assume a role that matches the music they sing on stage, though they may also be composers. Many performers make use of a persona. Some artists create various characters, especially if their career is long and they go through many changes over time. For example, David Bowie initially adopted a role as alien messenger Ziggy Stardust, and later as The Thin White Duke. More than just artistic pseudonyms, the personae are independent characters used in the artist&#x27;s shows and albums (in this example, &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; and &quot;Station to Station&quot;). However, in music, a persona does not always mean a change. Some authors have noted that Bob Dylan&#x27;s charisma is due largely to his almost stereotyped image, always with a harmonica, guitar, and with his distinctive hair, nasal voice, and clothing. The persona also serves to claim a right or to draw attention to a certain subject. That is the case of Marilyn Manson and his interest in death and morbidity, and Madonna and her interest in sexuality.

=== Examples ===

==== American artists ====

* Beyoncé: the persona of Beyoncé, &quot;Sasha Fierce&quot;, appears on the album &quot;I Am... Sasha Fierce&quot;. According to Beyoncé, Sasha is her wilder side, emerging during high octane stage performances and serving as a sort of scapegoat for &quot;unladylike&quot; behavior.
* Lady Gaga: Jo Calderone, the persona of Gaga, performed at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Jo represents a drag male persona, and is often used in the performance of her song, &quot;You and I&quot;.
* Nicki Minaj: she employs multiple personae, ranging from what she calls the Harajuku Barbie persona to Roman Zolanski, a Polish homosexual. The personae were heavily used in her sophomore album, &quot;Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded&quot;.

==== British artists ====

* Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones: he takes the guise of Satan in the song &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; or of a housewife in &quot;Slave&quot;
* Spice Girls: each member of girl group adopted personas based on nicknames given to them by the British press. According to &quot;Music Week&quot;, these personas (&quot;Ginger&quot;, &quot;Posh&quot;, &quot;Baby&quot;, &quot;Sporty&quot; and &quot;Scary&quot;) played a key role in the group&#x27;s international marketability. Spice Girl Melanie C later said the personas were &quot;like a protection mechanism because it was like putting on this armour of being this, this character, rather than it actually being you.&quot;
* The Beatles: they present a group persona &quot;of Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, including the character Billy Shears &quot;played by&quot; drummer Ringo Starr.
==In marketing and user experience design==

Personas are used in marketing and advertising by creating a marketing persona that represents a group or segment of customers so that the company can focus its efforts. For example, online advertising agencies can monitor pictures, browsing history and the ads people surfing the internet generally select or choose to click, and based on that data they tailor their merchandise to a targeted audience or better describe a customer segments using a data driven approach.

Personas are also used in user experience design, known as user personas. Alan Cooper introduced personas in his book, &quot;The Inmates Are Running the Asylum&quot; (1998). Cooper play-acted fictitious characters in order to help solve design questions. These personas need to be based on user research and can also be described in narrative form. Creating personas has become synonymous with creating a document, known as persona profile, instead of an &quot;activity of empathetic role-play&quot;.

<doc id="179904" wikidata="Q2310145" url="?curid=179904" title="Meteorologist">
<text>A meteorologist is a scientist who studies and works in the field of meteorology aiming to understand or predict Earth&#x27;s atmospheric phenomena including the weather. Those who study meteorological phenomena are meteorologists in research, while those using mathematical models and knowledge to prepare daily weather forecasts are called &quot;weather forecasters&quot; or &quot;operational meteorologists&quot;.

Meteorologists work in government agencies, private consulting and research services, industrial enterprises, utilities, radio and television stations, and in education. They are not to be confused with weather presenters, who present the weather forecast in the media and range in training from journalists having just minimal training in meteorology to full-fledged meteorologists.

==Description==
Meteorologists study the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and its interactions with the Earth&#x27;s surface, the oceans and the biosphere. Their knowledge of applied mathematics and physics allows them to understand the full range of atmospheric phenomena, from snowflake formation to the Earth&#x27;s general climate.
Research meteorologists are specialized in areas like:

* Climatology to estimate the various components of the climate and their variability to determine, for example, the wind potential of a given region or global warming.
* Air quality where they are interested in the phenomena of transport, transformation and dispersion of atmospheric pollutants and may be called upon to design scenarios for the reduction of polluting emissions.
* Atmospheric convection to refine knowledge of the structure and forces involved in tropical cyclones, thunderstorms and mid-latitude storms;
* The modeling of the atmosphere and the development of numerical weather prediction.

Operational meteorologists, also known as forecasters: 
* Collect weather data in some countries, but it is mostly done by technicians elsewhere.
* Analyze data and numerical weather prediction model outputs to prepare daily weather forecasts.
* Provide weather advice and guidance to private or governmental users.
* Collaborate with the researchers for integrating science and technology into the forecast process, in particular for indices and model outputs, for weather-dependent users such as farming, forestry, aviation, maritime shipping and fisheries, etc.

Meteorologists can also be consultants for private firms in studies for projects involving weather phenomena such as windfarms, tornado protection, etc. They finally can be weather presenters in the media (radio, TV, internet).

==Training==

To become a meteorologist, a person must take at least one undergraduate university degree in meteorology. For researchers, this training continues with higher education, while for forecasters, each country has its own way of training. For example, the Meteorological Service of Canada and UK Met Office have their own training course after the university, while Météo-France takes charge of all the training once the person has passed the entrance examination at the National School of Meteorology after high school. In United States, forecasters are hired by the National Weather Service or private firms after university, and receive on-the-job training, while researchers are hired according to their expertise.

In some countries, such as in United States, there is a third way where a graduate in meteorology and communication at the college or university level can be hired as media meteorologists. They are to be distinguished from weather presenters who have only a communication degree.

==Some notable meteorologists==
* Francis Beaufort, inventor of the wind scale that bears his name.
* Vilhelm Bjerknes, founder of modern meteorology who created the Bergen School of Meteorology, where researchers defined the frontal theory and cyclogenesis of mid-latitudes storms.
* Jacob Bjerknes, son of the former, who attended the Norwegian school and who studied the El Niño phenomenon. He linked the latter to the Southern Oscillation.
* Daniel Draper, inventor of a number of important weather measurement devices including a self-recording wind direction and velocity instruments, self-recording dry and wet bulb thermometers, a hygrograph, a self-recording rain gauge, a sun thermometer, and a weighing mercurial barograph.
* George Hadley, first to introduce the effect of the rotation of the Earth in the explanation of the trade winds and atmospheric circulation.
* Anna Mani, Indian physicist and meteorologist who made contributions to the field of meteorological instrumentation, conducted research, and published numerous papers on solar radiation, ozone, and wind energy measurements.
* Sverre Petterssen, member of the Norwegian School of Meteorology and later one of the three team leaders of James Stagg for the Normandy landings.

<text>Meenachil is the north-eastern region of Kottayam district in Kerala, south India. The name originates from Meenakshi, the Hindu Goddess. Pala is the main city in Meenachil. The arterial river of the district is also named Meenachil.

==Geography==

The Meenachil River, also known as Kavanar, Gauna, Valanjar originates at &quot;vagamon&quot; in the Western Ghats of Kerala, flows westward through Erattupetta, Palai, Kidangoor, Ettumanoor and Kottayam. Its length is about 87 kilometers. Near Kottayam it splits into a number of distributaries before emptying into the Vembanad Lake. Kumarakom, the bird sanctuary and tourist resort is on one such branch.

==History==

The current Meenachil taluk was a principality under the rulers of the royal family often referred to as the &quot;Meenachil Karthas&quot; (also known as &quot;Njavakkat Karthas&quot;) before Marthanda Varma annexed it to Travancore in 1754. The name of the place comes from Goddess Meenakshi, the deity of the &quot;Karthas&quot;. Veera Kerala Damodara Simhar was a chieftain belonging to this family. The southern bank of the river was the kingdom of &quot;Thekkumkoor&quot;, the capital of which was Changanassery, and the northern bank, that of &quot;Vadakkumkoor&quot;, with its capital at Kaduthuruthy. The Poonjar royal family also held sway over significant areas of the district towards the east.

==Economy==
Though food crops like paddy and tapioca are cultivated, majority of the population depends on cash crops like rubber and black pepper for income. Turmeric,ginger,cardamom,aracanut, coconut, nutmeg,clove,karuva pattai, jackfruit, tamarind where cultivated here.Recently people had diversified into the cultivation of vanilla on account of the sudden spurt in prices. However, with rubber prices ruling high and vanilla prices nosediving, the original agricultural pattern is seen reemerging. Though there are families with considerable wealth, a large section of the population are farmers with small and medium agricultural holdings.

The Kerala Government has recently (2006) accorded high priority to the implementation of the Meenachil River Valley Project. The project aims at diverting excess water from the Moovattupuzha river into the Meenachil River basin by constructing a tunnel from Arakkulam to Melukavu. Once implemented the project will help in increasing the availability of water in the area.

==Festivals==
Some of the important festivals celebrated in the region are:&lt;br&gt;
1. Kumaranalloor Thrikarthika &lt;br&gt;
2. The Katappattor temple festival (April)&lt;br&gt;

Traditionally, the region is the hotbed of various factions of the Kerala Congress. However mainstream parties like the Indian National Congress, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Communist Party of India, NCP (Nationalist Congress Party) Bharatiya Janata Party also have significant following. The prices of rubber and other agricultural prices determine the agenda of many elections. It is alleged that the church influences the political agenda significantly.
