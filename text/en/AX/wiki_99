<text>The County of Mark (, colloquially known as ) was a county and state of the Holy Roman Empire in the Lower Rhenish–Westphalian Circle. It lay south of Lippe river on both sides of the Ruhr river along the Volme and Lenne rivers.

The Counts de la Mark were among the most powerful and influential Westphalian lords in the Holy Roman Empire. The name &quot;Mark&quot; derived from a small village Mark and the nearby Castle Mark, the latter was built between 1190 and 1202, both today incorporated in the unitary authority Hamm, founded in 1226 by the first Count, Adolph de la Mark. His father used the older title Altena or Berg-Altena.
The name of the county is recalled to the present-day district in lands south of the Ruhr in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in 1975 when the districts were rearranged and the former district Altena was merged with former parts of neighbouring districts. The district Märkischer Kreis is only the southern part of the former county, the county is now divided between Märkischer Kreis, parts of Cities Bochum, Dortmund, Hagen, Hamm and the districts Kreis Unna, Soest and Ennepetal

== Geography ==
The County of the Mark enclosed an area of approximately 3,000 km2 and extended between the Lippe and Aggers rivers (north-south) and between Gelsenkirchen and Bad Sassendorf (west-east) for about 75 km. The east–west flowing Ruhr separated the county into two different regions: the northern, fertile lowlands of Hellweg Börde; and the southern hills of the Süder Uplands (Sauerland). In the south–north direction the southern part of the county was crossed by the Lenne. In the region of the Lower Lenne was the County of Limburg (1243–1808), a fiefdom of Berg.

The seat of the Counts of the Mark von de Marck or de la Marck was originally the Burg Altena in the Sauerland region, but moved to &quot;Burg Mark&quot; near Hamm in the 1220s. The county was bordered by Vest Recklinghausen, the County of Dortmund, the Bishopric of Münster, the County of Limburg, Werden Abbey, and Essen Abbey.

== Coat of arms ==

The coat of arms of the county was &quot;Or a fess chequy Gules and Argent of three&quot;. These arms have been used by the city of Hamm since 1226. Many other places in the area include the red and white checkered fess in their arms as a reference to the county and often to their founders.

== History ==

Originally belonging to a collateral line of the counts of Berg at Altena, the territory emerged under the name of Berg-Altena in 1160. About 1198 Count Frederick I purchased the &quot;Mark Oberhof&quot;, a parish land (&quot;Feldmark&quot;) on the territory of the Edelherren of Rüdenberg, liensmen of the Cologne archbishop Philip von Heinsberg. Here Frederick had the Mark Castle (&quot;Burg Mark&quot;) erected as the residence of the new &quot;Counts of the Mark&quot;. The nearby town of Hamm was founded by his son Adolf I, Count of the Mark in 1226, it soon became most important settlement of the county and was often used as residence.

In the 1288 Battle of Worringen, Count Eberhard II fought on the side of Duke John I of Brabant and Count Adolph V of Berg against his liege, the Cologne archbishop Siegfried II of Westerburg, titular Duke of Westphalia. As Brabant and its allies were victorious, the County of Mark gained supremacy in southern Westphalia and became independent of the Archbishopric of Cologne. The territory of Mark was for long restricted to the lands between the Ruhr and Lippe rivers (&quot;Lower Mark&quot;). New territories in the north (&quot;Higher Mark&quot;) were gained during the 14th century in wars against the Prince-Bishopric of Münster.

In 1332 Count Adolph II married Margarete, the daughter of Count Dietrich VIII of Cleves. Adolph&#x27;s younger son Adolph III upon the death of Dietrich&#x27;s brother Count John acquired the County of Cleves on the western banks of the Rhine in 1368. In 1391 Adolph III also inherited the Mark from his elder brother Engelbert III and united both counties as &quot;Cleves-Mark&quot; in 1394.

In 1509 the heir to the throne of Cleves-Mark John III the Peaceful married Maria, the daughter of Duke William IV of Berg and Jülich. In 1511 he succeeded his father-in-law in Jülich-Berg and in 1521 his father in Cleves-Mark, resulting in the rule of almost all territories in present North Rhine-Westphalia in personal union, except for the ecclesiastical states. The dynasty of Jülich-Cleves-Berg became extinct in 1609, when the insane last duke John William had died. A long dispute about the succession followed, before the territory of Mark together with Cleves and Ravensberg was granted to the Brandenburg Elector John Sigismund of Hohenzollern by the 1614 Treaty of Xanten (generally accepted in 1666). It then became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after 1701.

In 1807 the County of the Mark passed from Prussia to France in the Treaties of Tilsit. In 1808 Napoleon then gave Mark to the elevated Grand Duchy of Berg, which was divided into four departments along the lines of Napoleonic France. Mark was in the Ruhr Department until the collapse of French power in 1813, when it returned to Prussia.

The Prussian administrative reform of 30 April 1815 placed Mark within Regierungsbezirk Arnsberg, Province of Westphalia. The Hohenzollern Prussian sovereigns remained Counts of the &quot;Prussian County of the Mark&quot; until 1918.
The &quot;County of the Mark&quot; has no official meaning anymore, but is used to informally refer to the region in North Rhine-Westphalia.

<text>Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants by agriculture for food, fuel, fiber, chemicals, recreation, or land conservation. Agronomy has come to include research of plant genetics, plant physiology, meteorology, and soil science. It is the application of a combination of sciences such as biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth science, and genetics. Professionals of agronomy are termed agronomists.

==History==

Early humans practiced hunter-gathering, but by around 10,000 BCE, they began to domesticate plants like wheat, barley and rice. This laid the foundation for agriculture.

Ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Egyptians and Romans made significant advances in farming. They introduced irrigation systems, crop rotation, and early forms of fertilization.

During this period, agricultural knowledge remained relatively static in Europe, though Islamic scholars made advances in agronomy. Ibn al-&#x27;Awwam, a 12th-century Andalusian agronomist, wrote the &quot;Kitāb al-Filāḥa&quot;, a comprehensive guide on farming practices, crop management and soil conservation.

The Renaissance saw a renewed interest in scientific exploration, including agriculture. Leonardo da Vinci and other scholars contributed to early agronomic theory, studying plant growth, crop rotation, and animal husbandry.

Agronomy emerged as a distinct scientific discipline in the 1800s, driven by advancements in chemistry and biology. The development of scientific methods led to the study of plant physiology, soil chemistry, and the role of fertilizers in crop production. Justus von Liebig, a German chemist, made groundbreaking discoveries about plant nutrition, establishing that plants require specific minerals, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, for growth.

In the early 20th century, industrialization began transforming agriculture. Mechanization, the development of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, and improved crop varieties, led to higher agricultural productivity. The Green Revolution (1940s-1960s), led by scientists like Norman Borlaug, introduced high-yield crop varieties and modern farming techniques, helping to avert hunger in many parts of the world.

By the late same century, concerns over the environmental impact of industrial agriculture, such as soil degradation, water pollution, and biodiversity loss, led to a push toward sustainable agriculture. Today agronomy continues to adapt to challenges of climate change, global food security and the need to balance productivity with environmental stewardship.

==Plant breeding==
This topic of agronomy involves selective breeding of plants to produce the best crops for various conditions. Plant breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including corn, soybeans, and wheat. It has also resulted in the development of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain named triticale was produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. Triticale contains more usable protein than does either rye or wheat. Agronomy has also been instrumental for fruit and vegetable production research. Furthermore, the application of plant breeding for turfgrass development has resulted in a reduction in the demand for fertilizer and water inputs (requirements), as well as turf-types with higher disease resistance.

==Biotechnology==
Agronomists use biotechnology to extend and expedite the development of desired characteristics. Biotechnology is often a laboratory activity requiring field testing of new crop varieties that are developed.

In addition to increasing crop yields agronomic biotechnology is being applied increasingly for novel uses other than food. For example, oilseed is at present used mainly for margarine and other food oils, but it can be modified to produce fatty acids for detergents, substitute fuels and petrochemicals.

==Soil science==

Agronomists study sustainable ways to make soils more productive and profitable. They classify soils and analyze them to determine whether they contain nutrients vital for plant growth. Common macronutrients analyzed include compounds of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Soil is also assessed for several micronutrients, like zinc and boron. The percentage of organic matter, soil pH, and nutrient holding capacity (cation exchange capacity) are tested in a regional laboratory. Agronomists will interpret these laboratory reports and make recommendations to modify soil nutrients for optimal plant growth.

===Soil conservation===
Additionally, agronomists develop methods to preserve soil and decrease the effects of [erosion] by wind and water. For example, a technique known as contour plowing may be used to prevent soil erosion and conserve rainfall. Researchers of agronomy also seek ways to use the soil more effectively for solving other problems. Such problems include the disposal of human and animal manure, water pollution, and pesticide accumulation in the soil, as well as preserving the soil for future generations such as the burning of paddocks after crop production. Pasture management techniques include no-till farming, planting of soil-binding grasses along contours on steep slopes, and using contour drains of depths as much as 1 metre.

==Agroecology==
Agroecology is the management of agricultural systems with an emphasis on ecological and environmental applications. This topic is associated closely with work for sustainable agriculture, organic farming, and alternative food systems and the development of alternative cropping systems.

==Theoretical modeling==
Theoretical production ecology is the quantitative study of the growth of crops. The plant is treated as a kind of biological factory, which processes light, carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients into harvestable products. The main parameters are temperature, sunlight, standing crop biomass, plant production distribution, and nutrient and water supply.

<text>Darjeeling (, , ) is a city in the northernmost region of the Indian state of West Bengal. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it has an average elevation of . To the west of Darjeeling lies the easternmost province of Nepal, to the east the Kingdom of Bhutan, to the north the Indian state of Sikkim, and farther north the Tibet Autonomous Region region of China. Bangladesh lies to the south and southeast, and most of the state of West Bengal lies to the south and southwest, connected to the Darjeeling region by a narrow tract. Kangchenjunga, the world&#x27;s third-highest mountain, rises to the north and is prominently visible on clear days.

In the early 19th century, during East India Company rule in India, Darjeeling was identified as a potential summer retreat for British officials, soldiers and their families. The narrow mountain ridge was leased from the Kingdom of Sikkim, and eventually annexed to British India. Experimentation with growing tea on the slopes below Darjeeling was highly successful. Thousands of labourers were recruited chiefly from Nepal to clear the forests, build European-style cottages and work in the tea plantations. The widespread deforestation displaced the indigenous peoples. Residential schools were established in and around Darjeeling for the education of children of the domiciled British in India. By the late-19th century, a novel narrow-gauge mountain railway, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, was bringing summer residents into the town and carrying a freight of tea out for export to the world. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, as the British left Darjeeling, its cottages were purchased by wealthy Indians from the plains and its tea plantations by out-of-town Indian business owners and conglomerates.

Darjeeling&#x27;s population today is constituted largely of the descendants of the indigenous and immigrant labourers that were employed in the original development of the town. Although their common language, the Nepali language, has been given official recognition at the state and federal levels in India, the recognition has created little meaningful employment for the language&#x27;s speakers nor has it increased their ability to have a significantly greater say in their political affairs. The tea industry and tourism are the mainstays of the town&#x27;s economy. Deforestation in the region after India&#x27;s independence has caused environmental damage, affecting the perennial springs that supply the town&#x27;s water. The population of Darjeeling meanwhile has exploded over the years, and unregulated construction, traffic congestion and water shortages are common. Many young locals, educated in government schools, have taken to migrating out for the lack of jobs matching their skills. Like out-migrants from other regions of northeastern India, they have been subjected to discrimination and racism in some Indian cities.

Darjeeling&#x27;s culture is highly cosmopolitan—a result of diverse ethnic groups intermixing and evolving away from their historical roots. The region&#x27;s indigenous cuisine is rich in fermented foods and beverages. Tourists have flocked to Darjeeling since the mid-19th century. In 1999, after an international campaign for its support, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 2005, Darjeeling tea was given geographical indication by the World Trade Organization as much for the protection of the brand as for the development of the region that produces it.

==Toponymy==
At the time of the first British arrival, Darjeeling was known among its Lepcha inhabitants as , or the &quot;Place of the Thunderbolt.&quot; According to the &quot;Oxford Concise Dictionary of World Place Names&quot;, Darjeeling is derived from the Tibetan or , meaning &quot;Land of Dorje,&quot; i.e. of the vajra, the weapon of the Hindu god Indra.

== History ==
===1780 to 1835===
Darjeeling lies between the Mechi and Teesta rivers in the Eastern Himalayas. In the 18th century, it was part of a boundary region that had stirred ambitions and insecurities in several South Asian states. For the greater part of the century, the Chogyal-ruler of the northern Kingdom of Sikkim had asserted possession of this territory. In the closing decades, the Gurkha kingdom of Nepal expanded eastwards to bring Darjeeling into its territory. Its army stopped short of the Teesta, beyond which at the time lay the Kingdom of Bhutan.

The English East India Company began to show an interest in the Darjeeling hills in the early 19th century. At the time Darjeeling&#x27;s indigenous population largely consisted of the Lepcha and Limbu peoples. The Company&#x27;s interference in territorial matters began in the aftermath of its army&#x27;s victory over the Gurkhas in the Anglo-Nepalese War. Fought between 1814 and 1816, the war concluded with two treaties, the Treaty of Sugauli and the Treaty of Titalia, under which Nepal was required to return the Darjeeling territory to Sikkim.

In 1829, two East India Company officials, Captain George Lloyd and J. W. Grant, en route to resolving a boundary dispute between Nepal and Sikkim, passed a crescent-shaped mountain ridge which they fancied excellent for a sanitorium for the British, or a resort for sheltering and recuperating from the heat of India&#x27;s plains. Lord William Bentinck, the Governor-General of India, to whom Lloyd communicated his notion, concurred, recommending a small presence of the army in addition for monitoring the frontier.

===1835–1857: East India Company rule===
Taking the ambition forward, in 1835 the East India Company negotiated the lease of a strip of land in a grant deed from the Chogyal. By the end of 1838, sappers from the army were readied for clearing the woods and construction planned in earnest after the monsoon rains. The following year, Archibald Campbell, a physician, was made &quot;superintendent&quot; of Darjeeling, and two public buildings, a hotel and a courthouse were raised. Soon, work had begun on bungalows that conformed to British tastes.

Turning Darjeeling into a resort required many more workers than were available in the scattered local populations. The British attracted workers from the neighbouring kingdoms, chiefly from Nepal but also from Sikkim and Bhutan. They did so by offering regular wages and lodgings, a contrast to the burdensome tax and forced labour regimens common in those kingdoms at the time. Tens of thousands arrived in Darjeeling. Not long after the Darjeeling Hill Cart Road was built in Northern Bengal, connecting Siliguri at the base of the Himalayan foothills to Darjeeling.

In 1833 the East India Company lost its monopoly rights in the tea trade with China. A plan was prepared for growing tea in India. Superintendent Campbell began experimentation in 1840 in Darjeeling which soon proved successful. European planters and sponsors acquired large stretches of the surrounding hillside and converted them to plantations, called &quot;tea gardens&quot;. Existing tracks and paths in the hills were improved, renamed as roads, and connected to the Hill Cart Road. The botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, who visited Darjeeling in the 1840s, noted that carts and pack animals on these roads were bringing fruit and produce from Nepal, wool and salt from Tibet, and labourers looking for work from just about everywhere.

The labour migrations created a burgeoning hostility between the East India Company and the neighbouring Himalayan kingdoms. By 1849 the hostility came to a head. Campbell and Hooker were allegedly kidnapped. Despite the two being released without harm, the British exploited the incident to annex some of territory between the Mechi and the Teesta rivers from Sikkim.

Darjeeling became a municipality in 1850. In the span of 15 years, this Himalayan tract had become a &quot;hill station&quot;, an official retreat for British administrators in a hilly, temperate, region of India. Hill stations, such as Simla (summer capital of the British Indian Empire), Ooty (summer capital of the Madras Presidency), and Nainital (summer capital of the North-Western Provinces) were all established between 1819 and the 1840s, a period during which the rule of the East India Company had spread to the greater part of the Indian subcontinent and the British felt confident about planning them. Darjeeling later became the summer capital of the Bengal Presidency.

===1858–1947: British Raj===
From 1850 to 1870 the tea industry in Darjeeling grew to 56 tea gardens employing some 8,000 labourers. The tea gardens&#x27; security forces kept a close watch on the labourers and used coercion when necessary to maintain intensive production. The labourers&#x27; disparate cultural and ethnic backgrounds and the tea gardens&#x27; commonly remote locations ensured the absence of worker mobilization. By the turn of the 20th century, 100 tea gardens employed an estimated 64,000 workers, and more than five million pound sterling were invested in Darjeeling tea. The widespread deforestation caused by the tea industry drastically changed the lives of the region&#x27;s forest dwellers, who were either forced to relocate to other forests or become employed in their former habitat in new colonial occupations. To the mix of the forest dwellers recruited, more labourers joined from across the Himalayas. They communicated with each other in the Nepali language. Later the language, and their customs and traditions would create the distinctive ethnicity of Darjeeling, called Indian Gorkha.
By the last decades of the 19th century, large numbers of administrative officials of the imperial and British Raj provincial governments had begun to travel to hill stations during the summers. Commerce in the stations had grown as had the trade with the plains. A train service to Darjeeling was announced in 1872. By 1878 trains could take summer residents from Calcutta, the capital of the British Indian Empire, to Siliguri at the base of the Darjeeling hills. Thereafter, Tonga horse-carriages were required to cover the last stretch on the Hill Cart Road. Ascending some , the journey required stopping at &quot;halting barracks&quot;, or stables for feeding or changing the horses. By 1880, railway tracks were being aligned along the Hill Cart Road, and the East Indian Railway Company Jamalpur Locomotive Workshop had begun to build steam locomotives for the route. Miniature steam engines made by Sharp, Stewart and Company of Manchester, were employed for pulling the train on a narrow gauge of two feet. The train service to Darjeeling was opened in July 1881. After cresting at the Ghoom railway station at above sea level, the train made a descent to Darjeeling. Darjeeling was now within a day&#x27;s travel from Calcutta.

Education became another aspect of Darjeeling&#x27;s notability by the turn of the 20th century. After the Charter Act 1833, which allowed unrestricted immigration, British women had begun to arrive in India in significantly more numbers than before. Hill stations became popular summer destinations for women and children as colonial physicians recommended them for improved maternal and infant health. The British soon began to consider hill stations promising sites for primary and secondary education. St Paul&#x27;s, an Anglican boys&#x27; school in Calcutta, was moved to Darjeeling in 1864. The Catholic Church opened St Joseph&#x27;s College for boys in Darjeeling in 1888. For girls, the Loreto Convent had already been established during Company rule; the Calcutta Christian Schools Society established the Queen&#x27;s Hill School in Darjeeling in 1895. Anglo-Indians (of mixed British and Indian ancestry) were discouraged from attending the better-known schools and Indians were almost always prohibited until after World War I.

In 1945, as the British Raj was drawing towards a close, the Nepalese-speaking Indian Gorkha residents of Darjeeling had not been granted rights as British Indian subjects. These residents were at the bottom of the economic ladder, and their physical appearance was now the occasional object of racism by Indians from the plains. The 1941 census had shown that the Gorkha in Darjeeling constituted 86% of the population. They made up 96% of the labour force in the tea gardens. Many had been recruited to fight for the British in the Second World War, but the British had been reluctant to displease the governments of Nepal and the Kingdom of Sikkim whose feudal labour regimes many original migrants had sought to escape.

===1947 onwards: independent India===

After the partition of India in 1947, Darjeeling became a part of the new province of West Bengal in the Dominion of India, and in 1950, of the state of West Bengal in the Republic of India. A British exodus from Darjeeling quickly followed. Their cottages were quickly purchased by the Indian upper classes from the plains who enrolled their children in the town&#x27;s many schools. These actions created social and economic tensions with the Indian Gorkha population and further marginalised the latter. Their lack of economic development, caused by a hierarchal economic system set up by the British, continued in some respects in the immediate decades after 1947. The Indian nationalism that emerged seemed to highlight the unclear position of the Indian Nepalis in the newly independent nation. The division of India into states comprising the regions of its different spoken languages had allowed a relatively large proportion of the educated speakers of these languages to find employment in the government-owned enterprises. In the instance of the Gorkhas, the federal and state governments refused to accept their requests for their own Nepali-speaking state in the northern regions of Bengal. Eventually, the demands for autonomy were downsized to calls for the recognition of the Nepali language for official state business in Nepali-speaking regions of Bengal. This was accepted in the West Bengal Official Language Act, 1961.

Darjeeling had a sizeable community of Sherpas, an ethnic group, originally from eastern Tibet whose ancestors had moved to some villages in Nepal below Mount Everest. Sherpas had come to Darjeeling in the second half of the 19th century as seasonal labourers looking for work in road-building. As mountaineering in the Himalayas had gained popularity and Nepal was closed to foreigners, many Western mountaineers and enthusiasts came to Darjeeling to plan their Himalayan expeditions. The Sherpas stood out for their exceptional physical ability as porters, their fitness eliciting visits to Darjeeling by European biochemists in the early 1900s. Among the most famous Sherpas who moved to Darjeeling were Ang Tharkay and Tenzing Norgay. On 29 May 1953, Tenzing and Edmund Hillary became the first two humans to stand atop Mount Everest, vaulting both to instant stardom worldwide. The prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, took Tenzing under his wing. Tenzing became the first field director of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute after it was established in Darjeeling in November 1954

A trickle of immigrants from Tibet proper into Darjeeling had begun in the second half of the 19th century. Wealthy Tibetan aristocrats had sent their children to Darjeeling&#x27;s schools, and some went on to settle in the Darjeeling area. After the annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1950–1951, many Tibetans emigrated to India, with some settling in the Darjeeling area, including the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s older brother Gyalo Thondup. After the 1959 Tibetan uprising, the Dalai Lama himself fled to exile in India, and tens of thousands of Tibetan refugees poured in after him, with many finding refuge in the Darjeeling–Kalimpong area. A Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre was established in Darjeeling in 1959.

In May 1975, the Kingdom of Sikkim to the north of Darjeeling was absorbed into the Republic of India through a referendum. A month thereafter, Sikkim, in which nearly two-thirds of the populace spoke Nepali, was made a state of India. It was not lost on the Gorkhas of the Darjeeling region that there were many more speakers of Nepali in the Gorkha districts of northern Bengal, and their calls for autonomy had borne no fruit. The Government of India, moreover, had been reluctant to recognise Nepali as an official language in the Constitution of India. Slights delivered by senior Indian leadership around this issue—Morarji Desai, a former prime minister calling Nepali a foreign language, and Vallabhbhai Patel, a former deputy prime minister, describing the Gorkhas as disloyal and entertaining &quot;Mongoloid prejudices&quot;—were all remembered. A decade later, during Rajiv Gandhi&#x27;s prime ministership, small regions in Assam to the east of Darjeeling, which had been riven by violent ethnic separatism, were granted statehood. All these factors played into creating a militant mood among the Gorkhas for statehood and brought the Gorkhaland movement to the forefront. It led to the founding of the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) under the leadership of Subhas Ghising. Agitation for a separate state in Darjeeling included violent protests, and fighting between the disparate militant groups. The agitation ceased after an agreement was reached between the government and the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF). It resulted in the establishment of an elected body in 1988, the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC), which received some autonomy to govern the district.

In 1992, the Nepali language was recognized officially at the federal level in India by inclusion in the Indian Constitution. Though Darjeeling became peaceful, the issue of a separate state lingered. Agitation for a new state again erupted in 2008, led by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM). In July 2011, a pact was signed between GJM, the state and national governments which included an elected Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), with limited autonomy within the state of West Bengal. It evoked little enthusiasm on the streets. In 2013, fresh agitation broke out in Darjeeling after Telangana, a region in southern India was granted statehood. Four years later, more agitation caused several months of violence, food shortages, and strikes in Darjeeling but resulted in the Morcha splitting into factions. In 2017, Mamata Banerjee, the West Bengal chief minister, appointed a moderate Morcha politician to leadership in a reconstituted GTA, marginalizing and eventually ousting the founder of the movement, Bimal Gurung.

==Geography and geology==

The Darjeeling hills (formally Darjeeling Himalayan hill region) comprise parts of Darjeeling district and all of Kalimpong district; specifically, they contain: Darjeeling Sadar subdivision, Kalimpong subdivision and Kurseong subdivision. Darjeeling town lies in the Sadar subdivision. It is located at an average elevation of on the Darjeeling–Jalapahar range which runs south to north starting at Ghum (Map 1). The range is Y-shaped with its base resting at Katapahar and Jalapahar and two arms diverging north of the Observatory Hill. The north-eastern arm dips swiftly and ends in the Lebong spur, while the north-western arm slopes gently, passing through North Point, and ends in the valley near the Tukver Tea Estate. Kangchenjunga, the world&#x27;s third-highest peak at , which lies to the north, is the most prominent mountain visible.

The Darjeeling hills have been formed by accumulations of folds, faults and tangential thrusts caused by a compression in the north–south direction as the Indian tectonic plate has subducted under the Eurasian plate. Their physical composition varies from unaltered sedimentary rocks in the southern regions to several types of metamorphic rock and some intrusive rocks in the middle and northern, suggesting upward intrusion of the Earth&#x27;s mantle. The collective process has sheared, folded, crushed together, fractured and jointed the rocks, reducing their strength and making them vulnerable to water percolating down their crevices and causing pore water pressure to build up. Phyllites and schists are found in the hills around Kalimpong, which lies to the east, and gneiss predominates the western regions in which Darjeeling lies.

Two studies (1990 and 2019) recorded that landslides were a serious concern in the area. Most are triggered by excessive rainfall, earthquakes, and quick erosion caused by torrents. They are accelerated by extensive deforestation, defective drainage, poorly built revetments and the presence of steep slopes that have been undercut to make shelves for paths, roads, and houses. Debris flows along existing gullies can sometimes bring along large boulders and cause damage to roads; in 1968, during a catastrophic rainstorm, the Darjeeling–Siliguri road was cut in 92 places by debris flows.

Teesta, the major river of the Darjeeling region, rises at from a glacier in Sikkim, and flows south, at first meeting the Rangpo river and then the Rangeet before exiting the hills and eventually joining the Brahmaputra river in Bangladesh. The flow rate of the Teesta is per second during the summer monsoon; it had had major floods in 1950 and 1968.

The continual tectonic activity of Darjeeling&#x27;s ancient past can be inferred from the surrounding landscape in such features as terraces that dip in their middle as a result of earlier horizontal pressure. Eroded fault scarps, or steps, observed in the landscape were caused by vertical slips in the faults below. Alluvial fans at different heights signify a succession of previous rivers that dried up and spread their silt outwards as their beds were raised by the uplift. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, Darjeeling town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes). A study published in 2018 found that residents of Darjeeling&#x27;s outer areas, which are lower-income and lower-lying, worried about catastrophic loss during an earthquake. The April 2015 Nepal earthquake was felt in Darjeeling, and these residents feared that in the instance of a major earthquake, the unplanned upper-level construction could very well give way and tumble down on them.

==Climate and environment==
===Climate===
Darjeeling has a temperate subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cwb).
The average annual precipitation in Darjeeling is approximately . Eighty percent of the annual rainfall takes place between the months of June and September, due to the monsoon of South Asia. The &quot;June–May ratio,&quot; or the percentage by which the rain increases from May to June, is 2.6 or 260%. In contrast, just 3% of the annual rainfall takes place between December and March. Darjeeling&#x27;s altitude—which is greater than some other regions of the Eastern Himalayas at the same latitude (27° N), such as the Assam hills—and its rarified air causes its UV radiation levels to be correspondingly higher. Its mean monthly UV radiance is approximately 4500 microwatts per square cm per day during the peak months of May, June, and July. It is 50% higher than the Assam hills to the east, whose altitude is .
===Environment===

From the beginning of the twentieth century, Darjeeling&#x27;s average temperature has increased by 4 °C, which is twice the world&#x27;s average, and the annual averages of its daily maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by greater margins. During the same period, relative humidity has decreased by 7%, and rainfall by annually. For its water the Darjeeling municipality and the surrounding hills depend to a large extent on perennial or seasonal &quot;jhora&quot; springs (see Map 1), especially during the pre-monsoon months from February to May. The Senchal Lakes, two artificial reservoirs built in 1910 and 1932 in a forested high-altitude area to the southeast (see Map 2), which are filled with water from a surrounding catchment area during the monsoon months, have a greatly reduced supply, as of 2016. Darjeeling&#x27;s explosive population growth in the period 1961–2011, and extensive deforestation even within the protected catchment area for the lakes, have caused many springs to have vastly reduced yields during the dry months from February to May. Of the 26 springs that had once fed the lakes, 12 have been affected. Forests and pastures have shrunk from 78% in 1900 to 38% in 2000, and cultivated land, which contributes to soil erosion, has correspondingly increased during the same time from 20% to 44%. By 2006, land records in Darjeeling showed that foodgrain-producing farmland had decreased proportionally, caused by accelerated levels of urbanisation and by subsistence farming giving way to commercial cropping, especially of tea. In 2016, acid rain, which can be caused by air pollution and can in turn damage forests, was observed in the Eastern Himalayas; the pH value in Darjeeling was measured at 4.2. A 2022 article quoting another 2016 study reported a pH value of 5.0±0.825 in the rainwater.

According to a 2014 study, the influx of the excess population in the tea plantations around Darjeeling into &quot;marginal areas of town—on backfill, slopes, septic tanks, and jhorās (springs)—has strapped the town’s colonial-era infrastructure. Despite building codes that prohibit buildings taller than three stories, the market for cheap housing in Darjeeling inspires developers to go skyward, often as many as eight stories. Hastily built apartment houses ... are falling into the jhorās and sliding down the mountainside.&quot;

== Flora and fauna ==

Darjeeling is a part of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling comprises sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen forests of sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd&#x27;s Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing vehicular traffic.

Forests and wildlife in the district are managed and protected by the Divisional Forest Officer of the Territorial and Wildlife wing of the West Bengal Forest Department. The fauna found in Darjeeling includes several species of ducks, teals, plovers and gulls that pass Darjeeling while migrating to and from Tibet. Small mammals found in the region include civets (such as small and large Indian civets, masked palm civet, spotted linsang and binturong), mongooses (such as Indian grey mongoose and crab-eating mongoose) and badgers (such as Burmese ferret-badger and greater hog badger). Other carnivores found in the area include Himalayan black bear and red panda. A conservation centre for red pandas opened at Darjeeling Zoo in 2014, building on a prior captive breeding program; this Species Survival Plan had about 25 red pandas by 2016. The Himalayan newt &quot;Tylotriton verrucosus&quot;, one of two salamander species occurring in India, is found in wetlands in the vicinity. The Himalayan relict dragonfly &quot;Epiophlebia laidlawi&quot;, one of just four species in the family Epiophlebiidae, was first described from the region.

== Demographics ==
The Indian decennial census of 2011 (the last for which there is processed data) recorded the population of the Darjeeling municipality to be 118,805 individuals. Of these, 59,618 were females and 59,187 were males, yielding a gender ratio of 1007 females for every 1000 males. The population density of the municipality was 15,990 individuals per km2 (41,000 per square mile). The literacy rate was 93.9%—the female literacy rate was 91.3% and the male was 96.4%. Among groups whose historical disadvantages have been recognized by the Constitution of India and designated for amelioration in subsequent commissions and programmes, the scheduled tribes of Darjeeling town constituted approximately 22.4% of the population, and the scheduled castes 7.7%. The work participation rate was 34.4%. The number of people living in slums was 25,026 individuals (which was 21.1% of the population). 

Darjeeling began to be an &quot;administrative&quot; town in independent India after being made the headquarters of Darjeeling district in 1947. During the period 1961–2011, the town&#x27;s population increased at an accelerated rate (Figure 1). An &quot;aspirational middle class&quot; arose, comprising families of professionals in the administration, and retail and service industries.

&quot;Indian Gorkha&quot; is a term that denotes the Nepali-speaking people of India, as distinct from the Nepali-speaking inhabitants of Nepal. As of 2016, the population of Darjeeling was predominantly Indian Gorkha. There were also smaller numbers of Lepchas, Bhutias, Tibetans, Bengalis, Marwaris and Biharis. In the 2011 census, between them they practised Hinduism (66.5%), Buddhism (23.9%), Christianity (5.1%) and Islam (3.9%). The Lepchas were considered the main indigenous community of the region; their original religion was a form of animism. The Nepali community was a complex mix of numerous castes and ethnic groups, with many roots in tribal and animist traditions. The accelerated growth of the town&#x27;s population and the tightly packed living conditions in which different ethnicities mixed created syncretic cultures in Darjeeling which evolved away from their historical roots.

According to a 2014 study, although the demand for labour in the tea estates surrounding Darjeeling had stayed roughly constant since 1910, the population of Nepali-speaking workers and their families in the tea estates had grown throughout. As the excess population migrated up to Darjeeling in search of jobs and housing, their cause was championed by the Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s; this had the effect of making a considerable number of non-Gorkha families leave their homes in Darjeeling.

Seasonal migration out of Darjeeling has long been a local feature, especially among the lower-income groups; substantial migration among middle-class youth is a 21st-century occurrence. Many educated young people in Darjeeling have begun to migrate out because the growth of jobs in the area has not kept pace with the numbers of people with tertiary degrees. For both groups of migrants, favoured destinations fall into three groups: 
*neighbouring Gangtok in Sikkim, and Siliguri in North Bengal at the base of the Darjeeling hills;
*the large bustling cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore, and Mumbai; and
*Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Those looking for immediate employment commonly work in call centres, beauty parlours, and dumpling stands.

Those looking for eventual employment in professional careers pursue higher education. Both groups have experienced racism and economic and social discrimination in India&#x27;s big cities, caused by their distinctive, more East Asian, physical appearance.

== Governance ==

The Darjeeling Municipality is one of the oldest in India, established on 1 July 1850, with ten wards. It was governed by commissioners who were nominated until 1916, then elected until 1932, and nominated again until 1947. After India&#x27;s independence that year, the commissioners continued to be appointed until 1964, when the first election was held. It was overturned by a court injunction; further elections and continual interference by West Bengal&#x27;s state government became the prevalent state of affairs. As of 2021, the municipality is governed by a board of councillors headed by a chairperson and a vice chairperson. The number of wards in the municipality increased to 32 in 1988. Wards represent electoral subdivisions; in 2017, 32 councillors were elected, one from each ward. The wards were reorganized and bifurcated in 2011.

The area of the town (municipality) was reduced from to in 2011 after bifurcation. By 2016, the municipality was surrounded by tea gardens and forestry department land and had minimal room for expansion.

In 2021 the town had approximately 22,000 households and 350 hotels and restaurants. That same year the following statistics were collected: the municipality considered wards 15, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, and 25 to be the core areas; most businesses, hotels, restaurants, and educational institutions were located in these wards and they were better connected to municipal electricity and water; wards 10, 15, 20 and areas of ward 30 were the most developed, whereas wards 1, 2, 13, 14, 27, 31, and 32 were the most deprived; and the latter group of wards contained 37 slums in which 23% of the population of Darjeeling resided.

In 1988, the Gorkha-dominated hill areas of Darjeeling district were given an autonomous form of governance under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC). In 2012, the DGHC was replaced by a similar body called the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA). The elected members of GTA manage certain affairs of the hills, including education, industry and land revenue; they cannot legislate or levy taxes. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) held power in the municipality until March 2022, when it was defeated by the newly-formed Hamro Party.

Darjeeling town is within the Darjeeling Assembly constituency that elects one member of West Bengal Legislative Assembly in state legislative elections every five years. The town is part of the Darjeeling parliamentary constituency that elects one member for the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India&#x27;s bicameral Parliament.

== Economy ==
A 2017 study described the Darjeeling area as entirely dependent on the production of tea and the inflow of tourists to create employment.

=== Tea ===
Darjeeling tea is produced on plantations in which a few leaves on each tea bush are plucked by women. During the tea bush&#x27;s dormancy period in the short winter season, it is pruned by the women to stimulate growth the following season. Unlike China, where the tea bush grew into a tree, the early British planters devised these means to monocrop tea in tightly packed hedges on vast estates. In the plantation factories, men operate machines to ferment, dry, and package the normally short-lived green tea leaves.

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, many of Darjeeling&#x27;s governmental and economic arrangements remained unchanged. When British planters auctioned off their estates, they were bought by Indians from the plains or corporations from elsewhere in India. Darjeeling&#x27;s labour force had long consisted of workers recruited from Nepal. Mid-19th-century British ethnologists had commended Nepalese for their step farming and other forms of settled agriculture in the Himalayan foothills. They were contrasted with Darjeeling&#x27;s native population of the Lepcha at the time of British annexation, who practised &quot;shifting agriculture&quot;. Planters believed that if allotted a house and a yard in which to grow vegetables and fruit, the Nepalis would be more inclined to stay. The arrangement, which lasted during the colonial period, was formalized in independent India&#x27;s Plantations Labour Act, 1951. As of 2017, workers maintain their two or three-bedroom homes which they do not own, become attached to their upkeep, and eventually hope to retire in them when an adult child who also works on the plantation inherits the house.

In 2017, the average basic daily wage (that is, without employee benefits) of a Darjeeling tea garden worker was Rupees 144.60 () per day. With benefits, it was Rupees 277.10 () per day. Comparatively, Darjeeling&#x27;s tea estate workers were paid less in 2017 than tea estate workers in several southern Indian states. The auction price of Darjeeling tea for 2017 was comparatively higher.

A 2017 study found that some 60% of the plantation labour jobs in the Darjeeling area were held by women. The protection and economic development of the tea labour force was one of the motivations for India&#x27;s enactment of the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. According to a 2017 study, &quot;India has pursued the recognition of iconic brands, not only to create market share but also to recognise the value of the GI system to encourage development in poor, rural regions with high unemployment rates. This is consistent with the broad WTO objective to encourage trade liberalisation in developing countries to reduce poverty.&quot; Darjeeling tea was given GI recognition in Europe in spite of some European Union member nations objecting to the use of the indication for blended tea. It was recognized in US Geographical Indication mark, &quot;DARJEELING, Registration No. 1,632,726.&quot;
Tea is produced in the Darjeeling hills and farther below in two different forms. Orthodox tea looks like the twisted and dried version of the green leaves on the bushes. The Darjeeling sub-division of the Darjeeling hills had 46 tea estates in 2017, producing mostly orthodox tea. This is commonly exported and is some of the world&#x27;s most expensive. In the crush, tear, curl, or CTC version, which is commonly grown in the Kurseong sub-division (with 29 tea estates), and the Kalimpong (with 6), the tea leaves are mechanically manipulated, fired, and turned into tiny hard pellets that look like instant coffee. Cheaply available, and boiled with milk and sugar, when CTC tea was introduced into the Indian market in the early 1950s, it turned India into a nation of tea drinkers.

The area of cultivation of Darjeeling tea increased from 16,569 hectares (in 1951) to a high of 20,065 (in 1990) and dropped to 17,820 (in 2014) according to a 2021 study. There were 99 tea estates in 1961; these increased until 1990 (when 102 were recorded) but dropped to 83 by 1995 and to 81 by 2014. The 20% drop from 1990 to 1995 was attributed in the study to India&#x27;s economic liberalisation which came into force in the very early 1990s. A 2017 study similarly reported the Indian tea industry to have been adversely affected by price drops after India&#x27;s economic liberalisation in the 1990s. Darjeeling tea garden owners invested their surpluses in more profitable industries elsewhere, causing a decline in productivity in the local tea industry. The Tea Board of India estimated of Darjeeling tea was produced in 2021; this constitutes about 0.5% of total produced in India.

=== Tourism===

Darjeeling has two peak tourism seasons, September to November and April to May. A 2014 study suggested that domestic tourism is the foundation of the town&#x27;s vacation business. The Chowrasta is a popular shopping and gathering area where a tourist might get their picture taken dressed in colourful and rustic local clothes. The tea plantations below are particularly visited by foreign tourists. Old bungalows in some plantations have been converted to deluxe lodgings in which rooms rent out dearly by any global standard. Some tourists hold dear the escape to a peaceful, unspoilt, and picturesque landscape evoked in Satyajit Ray&#x27;s 1962-film &quot;Kanchenjungha&quot;.

Darjeeling had become an important tourist destination as early as 1860. Since India&#x27;s economic liberalisation in 1991, tourism in Darjeeling has become cheaper, and Darjeeling, once considered a luxury destination, has become accessible to mass tourism. A 2016 study recorded the tourist influx into Darjeeling town between 2009 and 2014 as ranging from a low of 243,255 individuals in the 2010–2011 season to a high of 488,675 in 2012–2013; the large majority were domestic tourists, with foreign tourists never comprising more than 35,000 annual visitors.

Darjeeling can be reached by the narrow-gauge Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR) which travels a route long from Siliguri. Pulled by steam locomotives, it moves at speeds of between and per hour. Although the service was begun in the 19th century to move humans and freight efficiently, its primary clients today are tourists who are availing themselves of the opportunity to experience the mobilities of travel of a bygone era. After an international and national campaign for its support, the railway was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO in December 1999 at the 23rd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee held in Morocco. In &quot;Notes on Defining the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway: World Heritage Property&quot;, Unpublished manuscript. The DHR Archive, Kurseong, 2005, K. Weise had written:

The railway begins on the plains of West Bengal and soon begins climbing through a remnant of lowland jungle, including stands of teak. As the railway climbs, so the flora changes and its upper sections are dominated by enormous Himalayan pines, which in misty weather give a surreal quality to the landscape. It frequently hugs the ages of hillsides with drops, often of thousands of feet, to the plains and valleys below. Towering over the entire scene is the perennially snow-covered bulk of Kanchenjungha. ... From Kurseong the railway offers frequent views of this stupendous mountain, which by Ghoom dominates the entire landscape.

In a 1999 study, it was thought the tourist influx into Darjeeling had been adversely affected by the political instability in the region, including agitations in the 1980s. According to a 2018 study, tourism in Darjeeling is limited to a small area of the town so its effect on local employment is inadequate for alleviating Darjeeling&#x27;s high unemployment rate. According to the author, &quot;The majority of the employees and almost all of the top ranking officers in West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation are Bengalis; locals generally get employed as photographers, drivers, and guides.&quot;

== Utilities ==

The chief catchment area for Darjeeling municipality&#x27;s water is the Senchal Wildlife Sanctuary, located approximately to the southeast, covering an area of and lying between and in altitude. Natural springs in the sanctuary, not all perennial, are the main source of the water supply. The steep slopes of the surrounding ridges (at inclines of between 20° and 48°) can lead to high surface run-off, subsequent absorption, and collection of water in partially confined spaces. Upon reaching a critical volume, this groundwater can surge out as seasonal springs. Water collected from 26 perennial and seasonal springs is routed through stone conduits to the Senchal Lakes (Map 2) constructed in 1910 and 1932. From Senchal the water is piped to the town after purification at a filtration plant in Jorebungalow. There are a combined of pipes transporting water from Senchal to Darjeeling, and a further in the water distribution system within Darjeeling. In the months before the monsoon during which water in the Senchal lakes is reduced, it is augmented by pumping water electrically from another reservoir located near Khong Khola.

A 2012 report of the Darjeeling Municipality Waterworks Department stated that from the 1930s little or no maintenance had been undertaken on the water pipeline from Senchal. Engineers in the department suggested that there might be up to 35% transmission loss, and more within Darjeeling. Once in Darjeeling, the water is distributed along the colonial pattern, first serving more expensive and sought-after uphill neighbourhoods and then the low-income downhill ones, which have more restricted access to the supply. The system was designed to serve a population of up to 20,000 individuals. Between 1911 and 2011, there had been a six-fold increase in the population of the municipality, not including the large number of transients such as students, migrant workers, and tourists (see Figure 1). Increasing demand has led to a worsening shortfall in the water supply. As a result, many residents have to purchase water from private vendors who either supply it in water tankers or in hand-pushed carts; they sometimes collect the water from the local &quot;jhora&quot; or springs. (see Map 1). Larger private businesses are involved in supplying households but do so at a substantially higher cost.

As of 2020, every day 30 metric tonnes of solid waste are generated in Darjeeling, and during the peak tourist seasons, the amount goes up to 50 metric tonnes. Bulk waste, which is chiefly produced in residential areas, markets and hotels, is deposited in common dumping areas from which it is taken in tractor-trailers to dumping grounds. Open dumping, which is the disposal of waste in sites not designed for waste management, is commonly practiced, and has created economic and social tensions in Darjeeling.

In 1897 Darjeeling became the first town in India to be supplied by hydroelectricity, which was generated at the nearby Sidrapong Hydel Power Station; it was primarily for use in street lighting and private houses. Today, electricity is supplied by the West Bengal State Electricity Board from other locations.
== Transport ==
Darjeeling has two major arterial roads: Hill Cart Road—which is a continuation of National Highway 110 connecting Siliguri at the base of the Darjeeling hills to Darjeeling—and Lebong Cart Road (see Map 1). The average width of Darjeeling&#x27;s roads in 2018 was between and . According to a Darjeeling Municipality report of 2008, a little over half (55%) of Darjeeling&#x27;s roads were both metalled (paved with asphalt, or bitumen) and motorable; the rest were too narrow to admit traffic whether concrete roads or unpaved. There were three parking areas that were not located on the street and 13 on-street. Illegal parking along narrow roads has created congestion for both pedestrians and wheeled transport.

As of 2018, Darjeeling had no public transport system of buses. Less than one in 20 residents owned any form of vehicular transport, two-wheeled or four. For both locals and tourists motorized travel was limited to six- or eight-seater paratransit taxis that have no set routes or timetables. Passengers embark and disembark in the central shopping district of the town, making the area both congested and polluted. In 2015, in an attempt to tackle the pollution, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), which governs the district, introduced three battery-powered street-legal golf-cart-taxis on a trial basis. The taxis had cost approximately Rupees 36 lakh (or $14,670 in the 2015 exchange rate) per vehicle. Although the vehicles were factory-designed for a battery life of before requiring a recharge, their batteries were found to run out in . Chalking up the disparity to the challenges of Darjeeling&#x27;s steep streets, and the lack of mechanics to correct the malfunction, the administration withdrew the vehicles from the streets in 2016.

Darjeeling can be reached by motorized vehicles on National Highway 110, from Siliguri, away. Darjeeling has road connections with Bagdogra, Gangtok and Kathmandu and the neighbouring towns of Kurseong and Kalimpong. However, road and railway communications often get disrupted in the monsoons because of landslides. The nearest airport is Bagdogra Airport, located from Darjeeling.

== Culture ==

The culture of Darjeeling is diverse and includes a variety of indigenous practices and festivals; it has a regional distinctness from the rest of India. Mixing and intermarriage between ethnic groups have led to hybrid cultural forms and practices.

Major festivals are Dashain (Vijayadashami), Tihar (Diwali), Holi, Lakshmi Puja, Maghe Sankranti, Losar, Buddha Jayanti, and Christmas. Tibetan Buddhism is followed by some ethnic groups such as Tibetans, Lepchas, Bhutias, Sherpas, Yolmos, Gurungs, and Tamangs; their common festivals are the Tibetan new year festival Losar, Saga Dawa and Tendong Lho Rumfaat. The Kirati ethnic group Rais, Limbus, Sunuwars and Yakkhas celebrate Udhauli and Ubhauli as their main festival.

Popular Hindu deities are Durga, Kali, and Shiva; other deities with both Hindu and Buddhist influences, such as Manjushri and Macchindranāth, are popular among Newar people, and Gorakhnath, and worshipped by Gorkhas. The Mahakal Temple on Observatory Hill is a pilgrimage site for Hindu and Buddhists. Followers of Tibetan Buddhism, or Lamaism, have established several &quot;gompa&quot; or monasteries. Ghoom Monastery (8 km or 5 miles from the town), Bhutia Busty monastery, and Mag-Dhog Yolmowa preserve ancient Buddhist scripts. A Peace Pagoda was built in 1992 by the Japanese Buddhist organisation Nipponzan Myohoji. In the Tibetan Refugee Self Help Centre, Tibetan crafts like carpets, wood and leather work are displayed.

The Darjeeling Initiative, a civil society movement, holds the ten-day Darjeeling Carnival; it celebrates Darjeeling Hill&#x27;s musical and cultural heritage each year usually in November. A literary culture has matured in the Nepali-speaking population of the Darjeeling region; in 2013, Asit Rai, a resident and Nepali-language writer, was elected to the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour of India&#x27;s National Academy of Letters.

According to a 2017 study, Western music has long been popular in Darjeeling. In the &quot;lively hippie music scene&quot; in Kathmandu in the late 1960s, some of the earliest &quot;Western pop performers&quot; were from Darjeeling. The earliest Nepali-led hotel bands were from Darjeeling and many among them had played in hotels in Calcutta before. A 2004 study suggested that one possible reason for such leadership might have been that many Nepalis in Darjeeling had become Christians and were no longer bound by Hindu caste prejudices in which &quot;musical performance is associated with low caste standing&quot;. By the early 1990s, a common middle-class western popular music culture was much in evidence among the young people of Kathmandu, Nepal and the Nepalese-speaking youth in Darjeeling.

Football is the most popular sport in Darjeeling; the annual Gold Cup tournament was once a favourite event in the hills. An improvised form of ball made of rubber bands is often used for playing in the steep streets, and is known as Chungi.

Colonial architecture is exemplified in Darjeeling by cottages, Gothic churches, Planters&#x27; Club, the Raj Bhawan and various educational institutions.

===Food===
The traditional dietary culture of the town of Darjeeling has much in common with that of the Darjeeling hills, though urbanisation has affected the food habits throughout the region. A mug of tea with milk, with or without sugar, is traditionally the first drink of the day. Butter tea, made from compressed tea leaves, butter, water, milk and salt is a popular delicacy. The staple diet is eaten twice a day. The food in these regions is less spicy, cooked with either little or no oil, and semi-boiled. The first meal is eaten in the morning with cooked rice, dal, cooked vegetables mixed with potatoes, some fermented meat or milk products—dahi, or yoghurt; mohi, which is spicy buttermilk; and &quot;chhurpi&quot;, a kind of hard cheese made from cow or yak milk—and pickles commonly called bhat-dal-tharkari-achar. The second meal is dinner in the early evening, which consists of the same bhat-dal-tharkari-achar. Bhutia and Lepcha usually eat thukpa noodles in soup.

Traditionally, the people of the region have preferred cooked rice as the staple; however, roti made of wheat is also popular, mostly among the urban population. Cooked ground maize is sometimes eaten as staple food mostly in rural areas, where it might be eaten with mohi and gundruk, a fermented vegetable. Goyang, another fermented food, is made from the leaves of a local wild plant, abundantly available during the monsoon. The leaves are fermented for a month and then consumed for several months afterwards. Boiled with yak meat or beef to make a hearty thukpa soup, it is commonly prepared in Sherpa homes though seldom sold.

Some ethnic foods have cultural value in festivals. Celebration of festivals with the consumption of sel roti, a fermented cereal-based fried doughnut-like confectionery, is a custom of the Gorkha. Dahi, a fermented milk product, is consumed as a savoury addition to daily diets. It is also used by the Gorkha to make a paste with rice and food colour for applying to the foreheads of the younger members of the family by their elders during festivals and marriages. Alcoholic drinks can have a similar dual purpose; in addition to being consumed directly they are offered to gods and in the veneration of the dead. In some communities, they have been employed in spirit possession rituals.

Some Brahmin Gorkhas are vegetarians. Non-vegetarians eat chicken, mutton, buffalo, and pork. Beef is taboo to a majority of the Gorkha except for Tamang and Sherpa. Newar prefers buffalo meat. About two-thirds of people prepare ethnic fermented foods at home for consumption. Cooking is usually done by women. Traditionally members of the family sit together on bamboo mats in the kitchen, and meals are served by the female members of the family and then usually eaten by hand, though chopsticks made of bamboo are commonly used by the Bhutia and Tibetans. Plates are made of brass or have a thin layer of brass.

Popular alcoholic beverages sold in Darjeeling town include &quot;tongba&quot;, &quot;Jnaard&quot; (pronounced as Jaar) and &quot;chhaang&quot;, variations of a local beer made from fermenting finger millet. A popular food in Darjeeling is the &quot;momo&quot;, a steamed dumpling containing pork, beef, chicken or vegetables (cabbage or potatoes) cooked in a doughy wrapping and served with watery soup. Wai-Wai, originally a product of Nepal, is a packaged snack consisting of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form.

== Education ==

A study conducted between 2012 and 2014 observed that the elite schools established in Darjeeling during the late 19th century for the education of British children were offering English-medium instruction of high quality to Indian children. The Jesuit boys&#x27; school, St Joseph&#x27;s (usually called North Point), the Anglican boarding school for boys, St Paul&#x27;s, the co-educational Methodist school Mount Hermon, and the Catholic girls&#x27; school Loreto Convent (see Map 1) were attracting students from faraway places, including Burma and Thailand. North Point and Loreto had established colleges, St. Joseph&#x27;s College and Loreto College (now Southfield College); these along with the Darjeeling Government College, a co-educational college founded in 1948, made up the three colleges of Darjeeling. All were affiliated to University of North Bengal in Siliguri. The same study suggested that the private schools were no longer catering only to children of the affluent. Some lower-middle-class families in Darjeeling were sending their children to North Point and Loreto, despite their high fees, in order to give them better future opportunities. By 2014, colleges had increased the enrollment of students from rural backgrounds. In fields such as engineering and computer science, the local colleges, however, were less able to offer the professional training or career placement facilities of India&#x27;s growth centres, which had caused some students to leave Darjeeling after high school.

In the Darjeeling municipality in 2003–2004, there were 16,015 students in primary schools, 5,169 in higher-secondary schools, and 3,825 in colleges and universities. According to a 2013 study, few students attended college for there seemed little scope for realizing &quot;middle-class aspirations in Darjeeling through educational credentials&quot;. It noted that the fees in the better-funded private colleges, although affordable for the upper-level government officials or successful businesspersons, were too high for the lower-middle-classes in town. This put pressure on the only affordable college, the government college in the town&#x27;s centre. It was lower-priced but poorly funded, with broken windows, leaking roofs, and absent teachers, causing the students to feel neglected and affecting their attendance. The teachers for their part were unable to meet the extra demands placed on them.

A 2022 study noted that among the population of Darjeeling that lives in slums (comprising 11.72% of the town&#x27;s population as per the 2011 census), 13% had finished primary school but had gone no further, 45% had finished high school (grade 10) but no further, 13% had finished higher-secondary (grade 10+2), and 10% had been to college. A 2018 study reported that the water crisis in the Darjeeling town has especially affected adolescent girl students who go to government schools. Many do not have access to hygiene facilities such as toilets and bathrooms, either in their homes or at school, particularly for hygiene management during menstruation. The study found that most toilets in government schools were not usable and that no government schools had &quot;proper sanitary facilities for girls. There is no system of water in the toilets and no arrangement for cleaning the toilets daily.&quot; It stated that many girls do not drink water during the day for fear of having to use the school toilets.

Most tea plantations make no more than lower primary school instruction available on site. As a result, tea garden workers have typically had fewer opportunities for education. As of 2022, a little over a third of the female workforce and half the male were educated up to grade 8. The workers attributed this to their tea garden&#x27;s remoteness and lack of means in the family during their childhood. Some families have raised chickens or livestock or opened a corner shop to make more money; their children have gone to nearby towns to study in private schools in which the medium of instruction is English, which is thought to offer better career opportunities. The Nepali language was accepted as a teaching language in all primary schools with a Nepali-speaking majority in the Darjeeling district in 1935.

<text>HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, launched on 6 March 1787 at Deptford. She was the sixth vessel to bear the name.

In December 1797, Captain Edward Berry was appointed flag captain, flying Rear Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson&#x27;s flag.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
On 27 November 1793, the ships of a squadron under the command of Captain Thomas Pasley of captured &quot;Blonde&quot;. At the time of her capture &quot;Blonde&quot; was armed with 28 guns and had a crew of 210 men under the command of Citizen Gueria. A subsequent prize money notice listed the vessels that shared in the proceeds as &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, &quot;Vanguard&quot;, , , and .

In 1798 Nelson was detached into the Mediterranean by Earl St. Vincent with , , , , and . They sailed from Gibraltar on 9 May and on 12 May were struck by a violent gale in the Gulf of Lion that carried away &quot;Vanguard&#x27;s&quot; topmasts and foremast. The squadron bore up for Sardinia, &quot;Alexander&quot; taking &quot;Vanguard&quot; in tow.
On 19 May, while Nelson was off station repairing his storm damage, Napoleon Bonaparte sailed from Toulon with a force of 72 warships and 400 transports to strike at Egypt with the intention of eventually invading India. On 13 June he occupied Malta and, on 19 June, continued the passage to Egypt arriving off Alexandria on 1 July. On 31 May, Nelson returned to Toulon to find that the French had left 13 days earlier. Searching for the enemy he reached Naples on 17 June and Messina on 20 June. Here he learnt of the fall of Malta and the probable destination of the French. He sailed for Alexandria but overtook the French and arrived on 29 June, two days before them. Finding no enemy he returned to Sicily via Asia Minor. Convinced that the French were going to Egypt he set sail once more for Alexandria.
On the evening of 1 August 1798, half an hour before sunset, the Battle of the Nile began when Nelson attacked the French fleet which was moored in a strong line of battle in Aboukir Bay with gunboats, four frigates, and batteries on Aboukir Island to protect their flanks. was the leading ship and, followed by four others, she broke through the French line to anchor and fight from the shoreward side. &quot;Vanguard&quot; remained on the seaward side and soon the French van and centre were being overwhelmed by six ships on either side of their line. The French lost 11 ships of the line and two frigates. Their dead numbered 1700 and the wounded 1500. The British lost 218 killed and 678 wounded. 

&quot;Vanguard&quot; lost three officers killed, Thomas Seymour and John Taylor, midshipmen, and Captain Faddy of the marines. Lieutenants N. Vassal and J. Ayde, J. Campbell, the Admiral&#x27;s secretary, M. Austin, the boatswain, and J. Weatherspoon and George Antrim, midshipmen, were wounded. Twenty seamen and seven marines were killed and sixty seamen and eight marines were wounded. Nelson was also wounded. On 3 August the captains of the squadron met on board &quot;Orion&quot; and agreed to present Nelson with a sword.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; sailed for Naples on 19 August and arrived on 22 September. She was in need of new masts and a bowsprit but Nelson deferred getting them until he knew the situation of which was to be careened at Naples after grounding during the battle. The King of Naples came out to meet her.

In September, Captain Thomas Hardy took command, still under Nelson&#x27;s flag. Two months later a formidable French army had invaded Naples and on 16 December &quot;Vanguard&quot; was shifted out of gunshot of the ports. On 20 December Nelson, in order to evacuate the royal family and other important people, ordered the small barge of &quot;Vanguard&quot;, covered by three barges and the frigate , armed with cutlasses only, to be at the Victoria wharf. All the other boats of &quot;Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Alcmene&quot;, and the launches and carronades, were ordered to assemble on board &quot;Vanguard&quot; under the direction of Captain Hardy and row halfway to the Mola Figlio.

By 21 December the Neapolitan Royal Family, the British Ambassador and his family, several Neapolitan nobles and most of the English gentlemen and merchants had been embarked, numbering in all about 600 persons in the ships of the squadron. &quot;Vanguard&quot; sailed on 23 December and arrived, after a stormy passage, in Palermo on 26 December.

The ship had been the scene of the death of Prince Alberto of Naples and Sicily, one of the royal entourage on board, son of King Ferdinand VI and his wife Maria Carolina of Austria who were on board. Other royals on board were the Duke of Calabria, Prince of Salerno and their sisters the Princesses Maria Cristina, Maria Amalia and Princess Maria Antonia

Nelson shifted his flag from &quot;Vanguard&quot; to on 6 June 1799, taking with him Captain Hardy and a number of other officers, leaving Captain W. Brown in command. In 1800, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was taken out of commission at Portsmouth.

In 1801, under the command of Captain Sir Thomas Williams. &quot;Vanguard&quot; sailed from Portsmouth on 20 April to join the Baltic fleet. The fleet, under Vice Admiral Pole, returned on 10 August. &quot;Vanguard&quot;, , , , , , and sailed again on 19 August to cruise off Cádiz. The first four were victualled and provisioned for five months at Gibraltar and sailed for Jamaica in December. followed them as soon as she had watered at Tetuan.

==Napoleonic Wars==
In 1803, under the command of Captain James Walker, &quot;Vanguard&quot; was operating out of Jamaica on the Blockade of Saint-Domingue. On 30 June, and her squadron under Captain Henry William Bayntun were between Jean-Rabel and St. Nichola Mole in the West Indies, having just parted with a convoy when they spotted a sail of what appeared to be a large French warship. &quot;Cumberland&quot; and &quot;Vanguard&quot; approached her and after a few shots from &quot;Vanguard&quot; the French vessel surrendered, having suffered two men badly wounded, and being greatly outgunned. She proved to be the frigate &quot;Créole&quot;, of 44 guns, primarily 18-pounders, under the command of Citizen Le Ballard. She had been sailing from Cape François to Port au Prince with General Morgan (the second in command in San Domingo), his staff, and 530 soldiers, in addition to her crew of 150 men. The Royal Navy took her into service as HMS &quot;Creole&quot;.

While the British were taking possession of &quot;Créole&quot;, a small French navy schooner, under the command of a lieutenant and sailing the same course as &quot;Créole&quot;, sailed into the squadron; she too was seized. She had on board 100 bloodhounds from Cuba, which were &quot;intended to accompany the Army serving against the Blacks.&quot;

On 2 July 1803, Bayntun&#x27;s squadron captured the French privateer &quot;Superieure&quot;. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was the actual captor. The British took her into the Royal Navy as . The squadron also captured the privateer &quot;Poisson Vollant&quot;, which the Royal Navy also took into service.

About three weeks later, on 24 July, two French 74s, &quot;Duquesne&quot; and &quot;Duguay Trouin&quot;, and the frigate &quot;Guerrière&quot; put to sea from Cap-Français during a squall in an effort to evade , , , &quot;&quot; under Captain Perkins, and &quot;Vanguard&quot;, which were blockading the port. The French ships separated during the night but the British overtook &quot;Duquesne&quot; the following day and captured her after a short exchange of fire with &quot;Vanguard&quot;, which lost one man killed and one wounded. The prize was broken up on arrival in England after being damaged running on to the Morant Cays.
In September the French troops in northwest Saint Domingue were being closely pressed by the rebel slaves under General Jean-Jacques Dessalines. Captain Walker, off the Mole St. Nicholas, persuaded the General not to put the garrison of Saint-Marc to death but to march them to the Mole in safety where &quot;Vanguard&quot; would take possession of the shipping in the bay. The 850 men of the garrison, all very emaciated, were successfully evacuated, and the brig , pierced for 12 guns but only mounting 6, the brig &quot;Trois Amis&quot;, transport, and the schooner &quot;Mary Sally&quot; with 40 or 50 barrels of powder were brought out. The British took &quot;Papillon&quot; into service under her existing name. Then on 5 September &quot;Vanguard&quot; captured the French navy&#x27;s schooner &quot;Courier de Nantes&quot;, of two guns and four swivel guns. She had a crew of 15 men under the command of an &quot;enseigne de vaisseau&quot;, and was carrying 30 barrels of flour to Saint-Marc.

&quot;Vanguard&quot; captured the American schooner &quot;Independence&quot; on 16 November. Six days later &quot;Vanguard&quot; took the two French schooners &quot;Rosalle&quot;, laden with saltpeter and lignum vitae, and &quot;St Rosario&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Vanguard&quot; was paid off by the end of 1805. In 1807 she was repaired at Plymouth.

On 16 November 1807 , of London, was returning to London from Petersburg when she was on shore on the Middle Ground. and boats from &quot;Vanguard&quot; were able to get &quot;Leeds&quot; off after she had been stuck for 36 hours.

Under the command of Captain Thomas Baker, &quot;Vanguard&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral Thomas Bertie in 1808. In 1812 she was made a prison ship at Plymouth and in 1814 she became a powder hulk. &quot;Vanguard&quot; was broken up in 1821.

==Legacy==

The American investment firm Vanguard takes its name from HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; after founder John Bogle chose the name from an antique book chronicling historical British naval achievements. A likeness of the ship served as the company&#x27;s logo from 1981 to 2020.

&quot;Sails of Glory: Napoleonic Wars&quot; miniatures by Ares Games includes HMS &quot;Vanguard&quot; as one of the ships in its starter set. It is the British counterpart to the French ship-of-the-line &quot;Genereux&quot;.

<doc id="186739" wikidata="Q155639" url="?curid=186739" title="Messerschmitt Bf 109">
<text>The Messerschmitt Bf 109 is a monoplane fighter aircraft that was designed and initially produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW). Together with the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the Bf 109 formed the backbone of the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; fighter force during the Second World War. It was commonly called the Me 109 by Allied aircrew and some German aces, even though this was not the official German designation.

The Bf 109 was designed by Willy Messerschmitt and Robert Lusser, who worked at BFW during the early to mid-1930s. It was conceived as an interceptor. However, later models were developed to fulfill multiple tasks, serving as bomber escort, fighter-bomber, day-, night-, all-weather fighter, ground-attack aircraft, and aerial reconnaissance aircraft. It was one of the most advanced fighters when the fighter first appeared, being furnished with an all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, retractable landing gear, and powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. First flown on 29 May 1935, the Bf 109 entered operational service during 1937; it was first used in combat during the Spanish Civil War. 

During the Second World War, the Bf 109 was supplied to several states and was present in quantity on virtually every front in the western hemisphere; the fighter was still in service at the end of the conflict in 1945. It continued to be operated by several countries for many years after the conflict. The Bf 109 is the most produced fighter aircraft in history, a total of 34,248 airframes having been produced between 1936 and April 1945. Some of the Bf 109 production took place in Nazi concentration camps through slave labor.

The Bf 109 was flown by the three top-scoring fighter aces of all time, who claimed 928 victories among them while flying with &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 52, mainly on the Eastern Front. The highest-scoring, Erich Hartmann, was credited with 352 victories. The aircraft was also flown by Hans-Joachim Marseille, the highest-scoring ace in the North African campaign, who shot down 158 enemy aircraft (in about a third of the time). It was also flown by many aces from other countries fighting with Germany, notably the Finn Ilmari Juutilainen, the highest-scoring non-German ace. He scored 58 of his 94 confirmed victories with the Bf 109. Pilots from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia and Italy also flew the fighter. Through constant development, the Bf 109 remained competitive with the latest Allied fighter aircraft until the end of the war.

==Design and development==

===Origins===
During 1933, the &quot;Technisches Amt&quot; (C-Amt), the technical department of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (RLM) (&quot;Reich Aviation Ministry&quot;), concluded a series of research projects into the future of air combat. The result of the studies was four broad outlines for future aircraft:
*&quot;Rüstungsflugzeug I&quot; for a multi-seat medium bomber
*&quot;Rüstungsflugzeug II&quot; for a tactical bomber
*&quot;Rüstungsflugzeug III&quot; for a single-seat fighter
*&quot;Rüstungsflugzeug IV&quot; for a two-seat heavy fighter
&quot;Rüstungsflugzeug III&quot; was intended to be a short range interceptor, replacing the Arado Ar 64 and Heinkel He 51 biplanes then in service. In late March 1933, the RLM published the tactical requirements for a single-seat fighter in the document L.A. 1432/33.

The projected fighter needed to have a top speed of at , to be maintained for 20 minutes, while having a total flight duration of 90 minutes. The critical altitude of 6,000 metres was to be reached in no more than 17 minutes, and the fighter was to have an operational ceiling of . Power was to be provided by the new Junkers Jumo 210 engine of about . It was to be armed with either a single 20 mm MG C/30 engine-mounted cannon firing through the propeller hub as a &quot;Motorkanone&quot;, or two synchronized, engine cowl-mounted 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17 machine guns, or one lightweight engine-mounted 20 mm MG FF cannon with two 7.92 mm MG 17s. The MG C/30 was an airborne adaption of the 2 cm FlaK 30 anti-aircraft gun, which fired very powerful &quot;Long Solothurn&quot; ammunition, but was very heavy and had a low rate of fire. It was also specified that the wing loading should be kept below 100 kg/m2. The performance was to be evaluated based on the fighter&#x27;s level speed, rate of climb, and maneuverability, in that order.
It has been suggested that Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) was originally not invited to participate in the competition due to personal animosity between Willy Messerschmitt and RLM director Erhard Milch; however, recent research by Willy Radinger and Walter Shick indicates that this may not have been the case, as all three competing companies—Arado, Heinkel and BFW—received the development contract for the L.A. 1432/33 requirements at the same time in February 1934. A fourth company, Focke-Wulf, received a copy of the development contract only in September 1934. The powerplant was to be the new Junkers Jumo 210, but the proviso was made that it would be interchangeable with the more powerful, but less developed Daimler-Benz DB 600 powerplant. Each was asked to deliver three prototypes for head-to-head testing in late 1934.

===Prototypes===

Design work on Messerschmitt Project Number P.1034 began in March 1934, just three weeks after the development contract was awarded. The basic mock-up was completed by May, and a more detailed design mock-up was ready by January 1935. The RLM designated the design as type &quot;Bf 109&quot;, the next available from a block of numbers assigned to BFW.

The first prototype (&quot;Versuchsflugzeug 1&quot; or V1), with civilian registration D-IABI, was completed by May 1935, but the new German engines were not yet ready. To get the &quot;R III&quot; designs into the air, the RLM acquired four Rolls-Royce Kestrel VI engines by trading Rolls-Royce a Heinkel He 70 &quot;Blitz&quot; for use as an engine test-bed. Messerschmitt received two of these engines and adapted the engine mounts of V1 to take the V-12 engine upright. V1 made its maiden flight at the end of May 1935 at the airfield located in the southernmost Augsburg neighborhood of Haunstetten, piloted by Hans-Dietrich &quot;Bubi&quot; Knoetzsch. After four months of flight testing, the aircraft was delivered in September to the Luftwaffe&#x27;s central test centre at the &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; Rechlin to take part in the design competition.

In 1935, the first Jumo engines became available, so V2 was completed in October using the Jumo 210A engine. V3 followed, the first to be mounted with guns, but it did not fly until May 1936 due to a delay in procuring another Jumo 210 engine.

===Design competition===
After Luftwaffe acceptance trials were completed at their headquarters &quot;Erprobungsstelle&quot; (&quot;E-Stelle&quot;) military aviation test and development facility at Rechlin, the prototypes were moved to the subordinate &quot;E-Stelle&quot; Baltic seacoast facility at Travemünde for the head-to-head portion of the competition. The aircraft participating in the trials were the Arado Ar 80 V3, the Focke-Wulf Fw 159 V3, the Heinkel He 112 V4 and the Bf 109 V2. The He 112 arrived first, in early February 1936, followed by the rest of the prototypes by the end of the month.

Because most fighter pilots of the Luftwaffe were used to biplanes with open cockpits, low wing loading, light g-forces and easy handling like the Heinkel He 51, they were very critical of the Bf 109 at first. However, it soon became one of the frontrunners in the contest, as the Arado and Focke-Wulf entries, which were intended as &quot;backup&quot; programmes to safeguard against failure of the two favourites, proved to be completely outclassed. The Arado Ar 80, with its gull wing (replaced with a straight, tapered wing on the V3) and fixed, spatted undercarriage was overweight and underpowered, and the design was abandoned after three prototypes had been built. The parasol winged Fw 159, potentially inspired by the same firm&#x27;s earlier Focke-Wulf Fw 56, was always considered by the &quot;E-Stelle&quot; Travemünde facility&#x27;s staff to be a compromise between a biplane and an aerodynamically more efficient, low-wing monoplane. Although it had some advanced features, it used a novel, complex retractable main undercarriage which proved to be unreliable.
Initially, the Bf 109 was regarded with disfavour by E-Stelle test pilots because of its steep ground angle, which resulted in poor forward visibility when taxiing; the sideways-hinged cockpit canopy, which could not be opened in flight (but could be dropped by the emergency arm). They were also concerned about the high wing loading.

The Heinkel He 112, based on a scaled-down &quot;Blitz&quot;, was the favourite of the Luftwaffe leaders. Compared with the Bf 109, it was also cheaper. Positive aspects of the He 112 included the wide track and robustness of the undercarriage (this opened outwards from mid wing, as opposed to the 109s which opened from the wing root), considerably better visibility from the cockpit and a lower wing loading that made for easier landings. In addition, the V4 had a single-piece, clear-view, sliding cockpit canopy and a more powerful Jumo 210Da engine with a modified exhaust system. However, the He 112 was also structurally complicated, being 18% heavier than the Bf 109, and it soon became clear that the thick wing, which spanned 12.6 m (41 ft 4 in) with an area of 23.2 m2 (249.7 ft2) on the first prototype (V1), was a disadvantage for a light fighter, decreasing the aircraft&#x27;s rate of roll and manoeuvrability. As a result, the He 112 V4 which was used for the trials had new wings, spanning 11.5 m (37 ft 8.75 in) with an area of 21.6 m2 (232.5 ft2). However, the improvements had not been fully tested and the He 112 V4 could not be demonstrated in accordance with the rules laid down by the Acceptance Commission, placing it at a distinct disadvantage.

Because of its smaller, lighter airframe, the Bf 109 was 30 km/h (20 mph) faster than the He 112 in level flight, and superior in climbing and diving. The Commission ultimately ruled in favour of the Bf 109 because of the Messerschmitt test pilot&#x27;s demonstration of the 109&#x27;s capabilities during a series of spins, dives, flick rolls and tight turns, throughout which the pilot was in complete control of the aircraft.

In March, the RLM received news that the British Supermarine Spitfire had been ordered into production. It was felt that a quick decision was needed to get the winning design into production as soon as possible, so on 12 March, the RLM announced the results of the competition in a document entitled &quot;Bf 109 Priority Procurement&quot;, which ordered the Bf 109 into production. At the same time, Heinkel was instructed to radically redesign the He 112. The Messerschmitt 109 made its public debut during the 1936 Berlin Olympics when the V1 prototype was flown.

===Design features===
As with the earlier Bf 108, the new design was based on Messerschmitt&#x27;s &quot;lightweight construction&quot; principle, which aimed to minimise the number of separate parts in the aircraft. Examples of this could be found in the use of two large, complex brackets which were fitted to the firewall. These brackets incorporated the lower engine mounts and landing gear pivot point into one unit. A large forging attached to the firewall housed the main spar pick-up points and carried most of the wing loads. Contemporary design practice was usually to have these main load-bearing structures mounted on different parts of the airframe, with the loads being distributed through the structure via a series of strong-points. By concentrating the loads in the firewall, the structure of the Bf 109 could be made relatively light and uncomplicated.
An advantage of this design was that the main landing gear, which retracted through an 85-degree angle, was attached to the fuselage, making it possible to completely remove the wings for servicing without additional equipment to support the fuselage. It also allowed simplification of the wing structure, since it did not have to bear the loads imposed during takeoff or landing. The one major drawback of this landing gear arrangement was its narrow wheel track, making the aircraft unstable while on the ground. To increase stability, the legs were splayed outward somewhat, creating another problem in that the loads imposed during takeoff and landing were transferred up through the legs at an angle.

The small rudder of the Bf 109 was relatively ineffective at controlling the strong swing created by the powerful slipstream of the propeller during the early portion of the takeoff roll, and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads on the wheel opposite to the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough, the pivot point broke and the landing gear leg would collapse outward into its bay. Experienced pilots reported that the swing was easy to control, but some of the less-experienced pilots lost fighters on takeoff.

Because of the large ground angle caused by the long legs, forward visibility while on the ground was very poor, a problem exacerbated by the sideways-opening canopy. This meant that pilots had to taxi in a sinuous fashion which also imposed stresses on the splayed undercarriage legs. Ground accidents were a problem with inexperienced pilots, especially during the later stages of the war when pilots received less training before being sent to operational units. At least 10% of all Bf 109s were lost in takeoff and landing accidents, 1,500 of which occurred between 1939 and 1941. The installation of a fixed &quot;tall&quot; tailwheel on some of the late G-10s and −14s and the K-series helped alleviate the problem to a large extent.

From the inception of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed to gain access to the L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, &quot;Elektron&quot; magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling the engine block, which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant &quot;Kraftei&quot; engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.

Another example of the Bf 109&#x27;s advanced design was the use of a single, I-beam main spar in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give enough room for the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.

Another major difference from competing designs was the higher wing-loading. While the R-IV contract called for a wing-loading of less than 100 kg/m2, Messerschmitt felt this was unreasonable. With a low wing-loading and the engines available, a fighter would end up being slower than the bombers it was tasked with catching.

A fighter was designed primarily for high-speed flight. A smaller wing area was optimal for achieving high speed, but low-speed flight would suffer, as the smaller wing would require more airflow to generate enough lift to maintain flight. To compensate for this, the Bf 109 included advanced high-lift devices on the wings, including automatically opening leading edge slats, and fairly large camber-changing flaps on the trailing edge. The slats increased the lift of the wing considerably when deployed, greatly improving the horizontal maneuverability of the aircraft, as several Luftwaffe veterans, such as Erwin Leykauf, attest. Messerschmitt also included ailerons that &quot;drooped&quot; when the flaps were lowered (F series and later the lower radiator flap operated as part of the flap system), thereby increasing the effective flap area. When deployed, these devices effectively increased the wings&#x27; coefficient of lift.

Fighters with liquid-cooled engines were vulnerable to hits in the cooling system. For this reason, on later Bf 109 F, G and K models, the two coolant radiators were equipped with a cut-off system. If one radiator leaked, it was possible to fly on the second or to fly for at least five minutes with both closed. In 1943, Oberfeldwebel Edmund Roßmann got lost and landed behind Soviet lines. He agreed to show the Soviets how to service the plane. Soviet machine gun technician Viktor M. Sinaisky recalled:
===Armament and gondola cannons===
Reflecting Messerschmitt&#x27;s belief in low-weight, low-drag, simple monoplanes, the armament was placed in the fuselage. This kept the wings very thin and light. Two synchronized machine guns were mounted in the cowling, firing over the top of the engine and through the propeller arc. An alternative arrangement was also designed, consisting of a single autocannon firing through a blast tube between the cylinder banks of the engine, known as a &quot;Motorkanone&quot; mount in German. This was also the choice of armament layout on some contemporary monoplane fighters, such as the French Dewoitine D.520, or the American Bell P-39 Airacobra, and dated back to World War I&#x27;s small run of SPAD S.XII &quot;moteur-canon&quot;, 37 mm cannon-armed fighters in France.

When it was discovered in 1937 that the RAF was planning eight-gun batteries for its new Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighters, it was decided that the Bf 109 should be more heavily armed. The problem was that the only place available to mount additional guns was in the wings. Only one spot was available in each wing, between the wheel well and slats, with room for only one gun, either a 7.92 mm MG 17 machine gun, a 20 mm MG FF or a 20 mm MG FF/M cannon.

The first version of the Bf 109 to have wing guns was the C-1, which had one MG 17 in each wing. To avoid redesigning the wing to accommodate large ammunition boxes and access hatches, an unusual ammunition feed was devised whereby a continuous belt holding 500 rounds was fed along chutes out to the wing tip, around a roller, and then back along the wing, forward and beneath the gun breech, to the wing root, where it coursed around another roller and back to the weapon.

The gun barrel was placed in a long, large-diameter tube located between the spar and the leading edge. The tube channeled cooling air around the barrel and breech, exhausting from a slot at the rear of the wing. The installation was so cramped that parts of the MG 17&#x27;s breech mechanism extended into an opening created in the flap structure.

The much longer and heavier MG FF had to be mounted farther along the wing in an outer bay. A large hole was cut through the spar allowing the cannon to be fitted with the ammunition feed forward of the spar, while the breech block projected rearward through the spar. A 60-round ammunition drum was placed in a space closer to the wing root causing a bulge in the underside. A small hatch was incorporated in the bulge to allow access for changing the drum. The entire weapon could be removed for servicing by removing a leading edge panel.
From the 109F-series onwards, guns were no longer carried inside the wings. Instead, the Bf 109F had a 20 mm gun firing through the propeller shaft. The change was disliked by leading fighter pilots such as Adolf Galland and Walter Oesau, but others such as Werner Mölders considered the single nose-mounted gun to compensate well for the loss of the two wing guns. Galland had his Bf 109F-2 field-modified with a 20 mm MG FF/M autocannon, the &quot;/M&quot; suffix indicating the capability of firing thin-walled 20mm mine shells, installed internally in each wing.

In place of internal wing armament, additional firepower was provided through a pair of 20 mm MG 151/20 cannons installed in conformal gun pods under the wings. The conformal gun pods, exclusive of ammunition, weighed 135 kg (298 lb); and 135 to 145 rounds were provided per gun. The total weight, including ammunition, was 215 kg. Installation of the under-wing gun pods was a simple task that could be quickly performed by the unit&#x27;s armourers, and the gun pods imposed a reduction of speed of only . By comparison, the installed weight of a similar armament of two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon inside the wings of the Fw 190A-4/U8 was 130 kg (287 lb), without ammunition.

Although the additional armament increased the fighter&#x27;s potency as a bomber destroyer, it had an adverse effect on the handling qualities, reducing its performance in fighter-versus-fighter combat and accentuating the tendency of the fighter to swing pendulum-fashion in flight.

Some of the projected 109K-series models, such as the K-6, were designed to carry 30 mm (1.18 in) MK 108 cannons in the wings.

===Designation and nicknames===

Originally the aircraft was designated as Bf 109 by the RLM, since the design was submitted by the &quot;Bayerische Flugzeugwerke&quot; (literally &quot;Bavarian Aircraft Works&quot;, meaning &quot;Bavarian Aircraft Factory&quot;; sometimes abbreviated B.F.W., akin to BMW) during 1935.
The company was renamed Messerschmitt AG after 11 July 1938 when Erhard Milch finally allowed Willy Messerschmitt to acquire the company. All Messerschmitt aircraft that originated after that date, such as the Me 210, were to carry the &quot;Me&quot; designation. Despite regulations by the RLM, wartime documents from Messerschmitt AG, RLM and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; loss and strength reports continued to use both designations, sometimes even on the same page.

All extant airframes bear the official &quot;Bf 109&quot; designation on their identification plates, including the final K-4 models. The aircraft was often referred to by the folk-designation, &#x27;Me 109&#x27;, particularly by the Allies.

The aircraft was often nicknamed &quot;Messer&quot; by its operators and opponents alike; the name was not only an abbreviation of the manufacturer but also the German word for &quot;knife&quot;. In Finland, the Bf 109 was known as &quot;Mersu&quot;, although this was originally (and still is) the Finnish nickname for Mercedes-Benz cars.

Soviet aviators nicknamed the Bf 109 &quot;the skinny one&quot; (худо́й, &quot;khudoy&quot;), for its sleek appearance compared, for example, to the more robust Fw 190.

The names &quot;Anton&quot;, &quot;Berta&quot;, &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Dora&quot;, &quot;Emil&quot;, &quot;Friedrich&quot;, &quot;Gustav&quot;, and &quot;Kurfürst&quot; were derived from the variant&#x27;s official letter designation (e.g. Bf 109G – &quot;Gustav&quot;), based on the German spelling alphabet of World War II, a practice that was also used for other German aircraft designs. The G-6 variant was nicknamed by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; personnel as &quot;Die Beule&quot; (&quot;the bump/bulge&quot;) because of the cowling&#x27;s characteristic, bulging covers for the breeches of the 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 machine guns, with the separate &quot;Beule&quot; covers eliminated by the time of the G-10 model&#x27;s introduction of a subtly reshaped upper cowling.

===Record-setting flights===

In July 1937, not long after the public debut of the new fighter, three Bf 109Bs took part in the Flugmeeting airshow in Zürich under the command of Major Seidemann. They won in several categories: First prize in a speed race over a 202 km course, first prize in the class A category in the international &quot;Alpenrundflug&quot; for military aircraft, and victory in the international &quot;Patrouillenflug&quot; category.

On 11 November 1937, the Bf 109 V13, D-IPKY flown by Messerschmitt&#x27;s chief pilot Dr. Hermann Wurster, powered by a DB 601R racing engine, set a new world air speed record for &quot;landplanes with piston engines&quot; of , winning the title for Germany for the first time. Converted from a Bf 109D, the V13 had been fitted with a special racing DB 601R engine that could deliver for short periods. Both the FAI and contemporary publications, such as Flight, have recorded this aircraft as a Messerschmitt Bf 113 (or Bf 113R).

Heinkel, having had the He 112 rejected in the design competition of 1936, designed and built the He 100. On 6 June 1938, the He 100 V3, flown by Ernst Udet, captured the record with a speed of . On 30 March 1939, test pilot Hans Dieterle surpassed that record, reaching with the He 100 V8. Messerschmitt, however, soon regained the lead when, on 26 April 1939, &quot;Flugkapitän&quot; Fritz Wendel, flying the Me 209 V1, set a new record of . For propaganda purposes, the Me 209 V1 aircraft (possibly from its post-July 1938 first flight date) was given the designation Me 109R, with the later prefix, never used for wartime Bf 109 fighters. The Me 209 V1 was powered by the DB 601ARJ, producing 1,156 kW (1,550 hp), but capable of reaching 1,715 kW (2,300 hp). This world record for a piston-engined aircraft was to stand until 1969, when Darryl Greenamyer&#x27;s modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, &quot;Conquest I&quot;, broke it with a record speed.

==Variants==

When the Bf 109 was designed in 1934, by a team led by Willy Messerschmitt and Robert Lusser, its primary role was that of a high-speed, short-range interceptor. It used the most advanced aerodynamics of the time and embodied advanced structural design which was ahead of its contemporaries. In the early years of the war, the Bf 109 was the only single-engined fighter operated by the Luftwaffe, until the appearance of the Fw 190. The Bf 109 remained in production from 1937 through 1945 in many different variants and sub-variants. The primary engines used were the Daimler-Benz DB 601 and DB 605, though the Junkers Jumo 210 powered most of the pre-war variants. The most-produced Bf 109 model was the Bf 109G series (more than a third of all 109s built were the G-6 series, 12,000 units being manufactured from March 1943 until the end of the war). The initial production models of the A, B, C and D series were powered by the relatively low-powered, Junkers Jumo 210 series engines. A few prototypes of these early aircraft were converted to use the more powerful DB 600.

The first redesign came with the E series, including the naval variant, the Bf 109T (T standing for &quot;Träger&quot;, carrier). The Bf 109E (&quot;Emil&quot;) introduced structural changes to accommodate the heavier and more powerful Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine, heavier armament and increased fuel capacity. Partly due to its limited combat radius on internal fuel alone, resulting from its range limit, later variants of the E series had a fuselage ordnance rack for fighter-bomber operations or provision for a long-range, standardized drop-tank and used the DB 601N engine of higher power output. The Bf 109E first saw service with the &quot;Condor Legion&quot; during the last phase of the Spanish Civil War and was the main variant from the beginning of World War II until mid-1941 when the Bf 109F replaced it in the pure fighter role. (Eight Bf 109Es were assembled in Switzerland in 1946 by the Dornier-Werke, using licence-built airframes; a ninth airframe was assembled using spare parts.)

The second big redesign during 1939–40 gave birth to the F series. The &quot;Friedrich&quot; had new wings, cooling system and fuselage aerodynamics, with the DB 601N (F-1, F-2) or the DB 601E (F-3, F-4). Considered by many as the high-water mark of Bf 109 development, the F series abandoned the wing cannon and concentrated all armament in the forward fuselage with a pair of synchronized machine guns above and a single 15 or 20 mm &quot;Motorkanone&quot;-mount cannon behind the engine, the latter firing between the cylinder banks and through the propeller hub, itself covered by a more streamlined, half-elliptical shaped spinner that better matched the streamlining of the reshaped cowling, abandoning the smaller, conical spinner of the &quot;Emil&quot; subtype. The F-type also omitted the earlier stabilizer lift strut on either side of the tail. The improved aerodynamics were used by all later variants. Some Bf 109Fs were used late in the Battle of Britain in 1940 but the variant came into common use only in the first half of 1941.
The G series, or &quot;Gustav&quot;, was introduced in mid-1942. Its initial variants (G-1 through G-4) differed only in minor details from the Bf 109F, most notably in the more powerful DB 605 engine. Odd-numbered variants were built as high-altitude fighters with a pressurized cockpit and GM-1 boost, while even-numbered variants were un-pressurized, air superiority fighters and fighter-bombers. Long-range photo-reconnaissance variants also existed. The later G series (G-5 through G-14) was produced in a multitude of variants, with uprated armament and provision for kits of packaged, generally factory-installed parts known as &quot;Umrüst-Bausätze&quot; (&quot;conversion kits&quot;, usually contracted to &quot;Umbau&quot;) and adding a &quot;/U&quot; suffix to the aircraft designation when installed. Field kits known as &quot;Rüstsätze&quot; were also available for the G-series but those did not change the aircraft title. By early 1944, tactical requirements resulted in the addition of MW-50 water injection boost and high-performance superchargers, boosting engine output to . From early 1944, some G-2s, G-3s, G-4s and G-6s were converted to two-seat trainers, known as G-12s. An instructor&#x27;s cockpit was added behind the original cockpit and both were covered by an elongated, glazed canopy.

The final production version of the Bf 109 was the K series or &quot;Kurfürst&quot;, introduced in late 1944, powered by the DB 605D engine with up to . Though externally akin to the late production Bf 109G series, a large number of internal changes and aerodynamic improvements were incorporated that improved its effectiveness and remedied flaws, keeping it competitive with the latest Allied and Soviet fighters. The Bf 109&#x27;s outstanding rate of climb was superior to many Allied adversaries including the P-51D Mustang, Spitfire Mk. XIV and Hawker Tempest Mk. V.

After the war, the 109 was built in Czechoslovakia, as the Avia S-99 and Avia S-199 (with twenty-five S-199s serving with Israel in 1948) and in Spain as the Hispano Aviación Ha 1109 and Ha 1112.

==Production==

Total Bf 109 production was 33,984 units; wartime production (September 1939 to May 1945) was 30,573 units. Fighter production totalled 47% of all German aircraft production, and the Bf 109 accounted for 57% of all German fighter types produced. A total of 2,193 Bf 109 A–E was built prewar, from 1936 to August 1939.

In January 1943, as part of an effort to increase fighter production, Messerschmitt licensed an SS-owned company, DEST, to manufacture Bf 109 parts at Flossenbürg concentration camp. Messerschmitt provided skilled technicians, raw materials, and tools and the SS provided prisoners, in a deal that proved highly profitable for both parties. Production at Flossenbürg started in February. The number of prisoners working for Messerschmitt increased greatly after the bombing of Messerschmitt&#x27;s Regensburg plant on 17 August 1943. Erla, a subcontractor of Messerschmitt, established Flossenbürg subcamps to support its production: a subcamp at Johanngeorgenstadt, established in December 1943, to produce tailplanes for the Bf 109, and another subcamp at Mülsen-St. Micheln which produced Bf 109 wings, in January 1944. The Flossenbürg camp system had become a key supplier of Bf 109 parts by February 1944, when Messerschmitt&#x27;s Regensburg plant was bombed again during &quot;Big Week&quot;. Increased production at Flossenbürg was essential to restoring production in the aftermath of the attacks.

The Austrian resistance group, led by Heinrich Maier, very successfully passed on plans and production facilities in the Austrian area for Messerschmitt Bf 109 to the Allies from 1943. With the location of the production sites, the Allied bombers were able to attempt &quot;precise&quot; air strikes.

After the August 1943 Regensburg raid, some Bf 109 production was relocated to Gusen concentration camp in Austria, where the average prisoner&#x27;s life expectancy was six months. In order to make the new production facilities bomb-proof, other prisoners were forced to build tunnels so that production could be relocated underground. Many died while performing this hazardous duty. By mid-1944, more than a third of the production at the Regensburg factory originated in Flossenbürg and Gusen alone; only the final assembly was done in Regensburg. Separately, Erla employed thousands of concentration camp prisoners at Buchenwald on 109 production. Forced labor at Buchenwald produced approximately 300 Bf 109 fuselages, tail sections, and wings before the end of the war. 

Some 865 Bf 109G derivatives were manufactured postwar under licence as Czechoslovak-built Avia S-99 and S-199s, with the production ending in 1948. Production of the Spanish-built Hispano Aviación HA-1109 and HA-1112 &quot;Buchon&quot;s ended in 1958.

* Production up to end of March 1945 only.

==Operational history==

The first Bf 109As served in the Spanish Civil War. By September 1939, the Bf 109 had become the main fighter of the Luftwaffe, replacing the biplane fighters, and was instrumental in gaining air superiority for the Wehrmacht during the early stages of the war. During the Battle of Britain, it was pressed into the role of escort fighter, a role for which it was not originally designed, and it was widely employed as a fighter-bomber, as well as a photo-reconnaissance platform. Despite mixed results over Britain, with the introduction of the improved Bf 109F in early 1941, the type again proved to be an effective fighter during the Invasion of Yugoslavia (where it was used by both sides), the Battle of Crete, Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the USSR) and the Siege of Malta.

In 1942, it began to be partially replaced in Western Europe by a new German fighter, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, but it continued to serve in a multitude of roles on the Eastern Front and in the Defense of the Reich, as well as in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations and with Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Afrikakorps. It was also supplied to several of Germany&#x27;s allies, including Italy, Finland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia.

More aerial kills were made with the Bf 109 than any other aircraft of World War II. Many of the aerial victories were accomplished against poorly trained and badly organized Soviet forces in 1941 during Barbarossa. The Soviets lost 21,200 aircraft, about half to combat. If shot down, the Luftwaffe pilots might land or parachute to friendly territory and return to fight again. Later in the war, when Allied victories began to bring the fight closer, and then in German territory, bombing raids supplied plenty of targets for the Luftwaffe. This unique combination of events — until American long-range fighters appeared very early in 1944, that steadily gave the Allies daylight air supremacy over the Reich — led to the highest-ever individual pilot victory scores. One hundred and five Bf 109 pilots were each credited with the destruction of 100 or more enemy aircraft. Thirteen of these men scored more than 200 kills, while two scored more than 300. Altogether, this group of pilots was credited with a total of nearly 15,000 kills. Though no official &quot;ace&quot; status existed in the Luftwaffe - the term &quot;Experte&quot; (expert) was used for an experienced pilot irrespective of his number of kills - using the Allied definition of pilots who scored five or more kills, more than 2,500 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter pilots were considered aces in World War II. Against the Soviets, Finnish-flown Bf 109Gs claimed a victory ratio of 25:1.

Bf 109s remained in foreign service for many years after the war. The Bf109 was the first aircraft deployed at the beginning of the Israeli Air Force. The Swiss used their Bf 109Gs well into the 1950s. The Finnish Air Force did not retire their Bf 109Gs until March 1954. Romania used its Bf 109s until 1955. The Spanish Hispanos flew even longer, some still in service in the late 1960s. They appeared in films (notably &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;) playing the role of Bf 109Es; some Hispano airframes were sold to museums, which rebuilt them as Bf 109s.

<text>Henschel &amp; Son () was a German company, located in Kassel, best known during the 20th century as a maker of transportation equipment, including locomotives, trucks, buses and trolleybuses, and armoured fighting vehicles and weapons.

Georg Christian Carl Henschel founded the factory in 1810 at Kassel. His son Carl Anton Henschel founded another factory in 1837. In 1848, the company began manufacturing locomotives. The factory became the largest locomotive manufacturer in Germany by the 20th century. Henschel built 10 articulated steam trucks, using Doble steam designs, for Deutsche Reichsbahn railways as delivery trucks. Several cars were built as well, one of which became Hermann Göring&#x27;s staff car. In 1935 Henschel was able to upgrade its various steam locomotives to a high-speed Streamliner type with a maximum speeds of up to by the addition of a removable shell over the old steam locomotive. In 1918, Henschel began the production of gearboxes at the Kassel plant. In January 1925, Henschel &amp; Son began building trucks and buses.

==World War II==


Early in 1935, Henschel began manufacturing Panzer I tanks. During World War II, the firm was responsible for license production of the Dornier Do 17Z medium bomber, and in 1939–1940 it began large-scale production of the Panzer III. Henschel was the sole manufacturer of the Tiger I, and alongside Porsche the Tiger II. In 1945, the company had 8,000 workers working in two shifts each of 12 hours, and forced labour was used extensively. The company&#x27;s factories, which also manufactured narrow-gauge locomotives, were among the most important Allied bomber targets and were nearly completely destroyed.

===Aviation===

*Henschel Projekt P.87, a Schnellbomber design similar to the Hs P.75, except that the canards in the front are straight and the wing is curved.
*Henschel &#x27;Zitterrochen&#x27; (Torpedofish), air-to-surface missile (pre-production only)

==Trolleybuses==

Manufacturing of trolleybuses began in 1941 and continued until 1962, ultimately totalling at least 680 vehicles, while Henschel also constructed the chassis for more than 240 others that used bodies by (which changed its name to Duewag many years later), of type ÜHIIIs and ÜHIIs. Almost all were purchased by transport companies in Germany or Austria, but Henschel&#x27;s single largest order for trolleybuses was from Buenos Aires, Argentina, for 175 vehicles built in 1952–1953, and the São Paulo trolleybus system purchased 50 Henschel–Uerdingen trolleybuses in 1954. All but 50 of the 175 Buenos Aires vehicles were fitted with bodies made by Nordwestdeutscher Fahrzeugbau.

==Post-war business==

Manufacturing began again in 1948. In 1964, the company took over Rheinische Stahlwerke and became Rheinstahl Henschel AG (Hanomag). The truck production of Henschel was merged with that of Hanomag that spun off to form Hanomag-Henschel in 1969, this later went to Daimler-Benz, which discontinued the brand name Hanomag-Henschel in 1974. The production was switched to commercial vehicle axles, in this area it is the largest factory in Europe. In 1976 Thyssen-Henschel, and 1990 ABB Henschel AG. In 1996, the company became ABB Daimler Benz Transportation Adtranz. The company was subsequently acquired by Bombardier (Canada) around 2002. The Kassel facility still exists and is one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturers of locomotives (Henschel Antriebstechnik).

<doc id="186746" wikidata="Q1120735" url="?curid=186746" title="Omen">
<text>An omen (also called &quot;portent&quot;) is a phenomenon that is believed to foretell the future, often signifying the advent of change. It was commonly believed in ancient history, and still believed by some today, that omens bring divine messages from the gods.

These omens include natural phenomena, for example an eclipse, abnormal births of animals (especially humans) and behaviour of the sacrificial lamb on its way to the slaughter. Specialists, known as diviners, variously existed to interpret these omens. They would also use an artificial method, for example, a clay model of a sheep liver, to communicate with their gods in times of crisis. They would expect a binary answer, either yes or no, favourable or unfavourable. They did these to predict what would happen in the future and to take action to avoid disaster.

Though the word &quot;omen&quot; is usually devoid of reference to the change&#x27;s nature, hence being possibly either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, the term is more often used in a foreboding sense, as with the word &quot;ominous&quot;. The word comes from its Latin equivalent , of otherwise uncertain origin.

==Ancient Near East==

The oldest source for this practice in the Ancient Near East came from Mesopotamian practice attested at the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. It was vigorously pursued by the Assyrian kings, Esarhaddon and his son, Ashurbanipal in the 7th century BC.
Omens were interpreted by several methods—e.g., liver divination, lecanomancy, and libanomancy. Hepatoscopy—observing irregularities and abnormalities of the entrails of a sacrificial sheep—was used in many royal services.

Astrological omens were popular in Assyria in the 7th century BC. Diviners gained influence by interpreting omens and advising the king, Esarhaddon (681–669 BC), how to avoid some terrible fate. Sometimes the Assyrian king hid for a while after he put a substitute king on the throne. The court expected that the substitute king would take the evil consequences of an omen. When they believed the danger was over, they executed the substitute king and the true king resumed the throne.

The observations of omens were recorded into series. Some of them dated back to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, and these were arranged as conditional statement later (if such and such is the case, then such and such is the result).

This belief of omens later spread out around the Near East and beyond when clay models of sheep livers used for the diviners to learn the craft was found in Boghazkoi, Ugarit, Megiddo, and Hazor.

Letters from the city Mari dated at the latest from the 18th century showed that these divinatory practices were not limited to the royal court, but also played an important role in everyday life of the people.

==Ancient Greece==
An (omen) was defined in antiquity as the carnivorous vulture, especially a prophetic bird. By careful observation of the bird&#x27;s cries and the way or direction it flew, the augurs attempted to predict the future. They also saw lightning or thunder as omens, sent from Zeus, and observed the direction in which they saw or heard them. Omens represented the divine will and the decisions of the gods, their positioning opposite human endeavors, and were aimed at being understood by sensitive receivers of the time, who brought the divine charisma to become intermediaries, channels between the world of gods and humans. Even since Homeric times, the Greeks paid special attention to these signs: when they saw vultures from the left, another symbol of Zeus, they considered it a bad omen. The cry of a heron or lightning to the right marked positive and promising omen. In the Greek territory, seers also judged good and bad omens from the unwillingness or willingness of a victim to approach the altar and by the state of its offal when slaughtered.

==Ancient Rome==

In ancient Roman religion, augurs interpreted the flights of birds to ascertain the will of the gods, in response to specific questions. Their system was complex; for example, while a bird-sign on the left was usually favourable (auspicious) and one on the right unfavourable (inauspicious), the combination of a raven on the right and a crow on the left was favourable. Augurs also studied the behaviour of domesticated, sacred chickens before embarking on important enterprises, such as a senatorial meeting, the passage of a new law, or a battle. These formal &quot;divine consultations&quot; by augurs are known as &quot;taking the auspices&quot;. Haruspices examined the liver, lungs and entrails of animals sacrifice to interpret the will of the gods, again in response to clear and specific proposals. Some omens came in the form of prodigies – unnatural, aberrant or unusual phenomena such as meteor showers, hermaphrodite births, or &quot;blood rain&quot;, any of which could signify that the gods had somehow been angered. The meaning and import of reported prodigies were officially debated and decided by the Roman senate, with advice from religious experts. Threatening signs could then be officially expiated and the gods placated with the appropriate sacrifice and rituals. The interpretation and expiation of omens that suggested a threat to the State was a serious business. In 217 BC the consul Gaius Flaminius &quot;disregarded his horse&#x27;s collapse, the chickens, and yet other omens, before his disaster at Lake Trasimene&quot;. Certain natural events, particularly lightning strikes and thunder, could be ominous for the public or state, or only for the individual who saw or heard them. When a thunderclap interrupted his election as consul, Marcellus gave up his candidacy. Thereafter he travelled in an enclosed litter when on important business, to avoid sight of any bad omens that might affect his plans.

Many Romans believed that particular words, phrases or incidents might carry prophetic content aimed at particular individuals who witnessed or heard them. Such &quot;private&quot; omens could be accepted, and their benefits secured (or their threat averted) by use of countersigns, or verbal formulas such as (&quot;I accept the omen, I hold to it&quot;); the consul L Aemilius Paullus, when about to embark on his campaign against King Perseus, heard his daughter say that her dog Persa had died; given the similarity of the names and the death of the dog, he took this as a sign that Perseus would be defeated – which he was. The orator and statesman Cicero, though an augur himself, and apparently convinced that in capable hands, it offered a reliable means of foretelling the future, was skeptical of unsolicited, personal omens. He reports the story that Licinius Crassus took ship for Syria despite the ominous call of a fig-seller – (&quot;Caunean figs!&quot;), which might be heard as (&quot;Beware, don&#x27;t go!&quot;) – and was killed on campaign. Cicero saw these events as merely coincidental; only the credulous could think them ominous. In Suetonius&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Caesars&quot;, the deaths of various emperors are presaged by omens and dreams; the emperor Caligula, for example, dreamt that he stood before the throne of Jupiter, king of the gods, and Jupiter kicked him down from heaven to earth; Caligula ignored the premonition and was assassinated the next day.

==Astrology==

In the field of astrology, solar and lunar eclipses (along with the appearance of comets and to some extent the full moon) have often been considered omens of notable births, deaths, or other significant events throughout history in many societies. One Biblical example is the Magi in the Gospel of Matthew; in the Nativity narrative of the Gospel of Matthew, the Magi are depicted as predicting the birth of Jesus after seeing the Star of Bethlehem.

<text>Rail transport in Germany is provided predominantly by &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; (DB, ). , the railway network in Germany (DB only) had a length of , of which were electrified and were double track. About are high-speed railway lines. Germany has the 6th longest railway network in the world, and the largest in Europe after Russia.

Germany was ranked 4th among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index assessing intensity of use, quality of service and safety. It had a very good rating for intensity of use, by both passengers and freight, and good ratings for quality of service and safety. It also captured relatively high value in return for public investment with cost to performance ratios that outperform the average ratio for all European countries.

Germany&#x27;s rail freight of 117 billion tons/kilometer meant it carried 17.6% of all inland German cargo in 2015.

Germany is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Germany is 80.

Urban rail in Germany includes rapid transit (known as &quot;U-Bahn&quot;), commuter rail (known as &quot;S-Bahn&quot;), &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; (light rail), trams and funiculars (e.g. in Dresden). Suspension railways () are present in two cities, Dresden and Wuppertal, in addition to the &quot;H-Bahn&quot; at Düsseldorf Airport and Dortmund University. Stuttgart has an urban rack railway.

==Overview==
In 2018, railways in Germany transported the following numbers of passengers and freight.&lt;ref name=&quot;destatis8/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operators ===

Deutsche Bahn (DB), a state-owned private company, is the main provider of railway service. In recent years a number of competitors have started business, such as SWEG, ODEG or FlixTrain. DB runs several semi-independent divisions, such as &quot;DB Fernverkehr&quot; (), &quot;DB Regio&quot; (with several subsidiaries) and DB Cargo. DB mostly offers state-funded regional services, but some companies offer long-distance services as well. In 2016, DB had a share of 67% in the regional railway market and 68.6% in the inland freight market.

As of October 2016, there were 452 railway operators registered in Germany, among them 124 regional passenger operators, 20 long-distance operators, and 163 freight operators. Transdev Germany is the largest private operator of buses and passenger trains in Germany. Also Netinera (previously ) operates several railway lines in Germany.

In 2018, public sector funding accounted for 25.6% of the cost of short-distance passenger transport including all rail and bus services. The long-distance market generally does not require government funding.

=== Special schemes ===

In June, July and August 2022, there was a special ticket called the 9-Euro-Ticket, which was a ticket with which passengers could travel for €9 per month on local and regional transport throughout Germany. The initiative aimed to reduce energy consumption during the global energy crisis in 2021–2022 and alleviate the costs of living for people. Some criticized the enterprise, saying it led to overcrowding of trains at some points

The &quot;Deutschlandticket&quot; replaces the 9-Euro-Ticket. This subscription public transport ticket costs €49 and is valid for all local public transport in Germany. The price for the &quot;Deutschlandticket&quot; will be raised to €58 per month in January 2025.

===Stations===

===Platform height===

The European Union Commission issued a TSI (Technical Specifications for Interoperability) on 30 May 2002, (2002/735/EC) that sets out standard platform heights for passenger steps on high-speed rail. These standard heights are and .

In Germany new builds are 550 mm and 760 mm. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has new builds with 550 mm. Hesse, NRW, Berlin had new builds with 760 mm.

===Routes===
===Track gauges===

===Signals===
===Rolling stock===
In 2014 (local passenger) and 2015 (other), the rolling stock used in Germany included the following numbers of vehicle types.


==Services==
=== Long-distance services of Deutsche Bahn ===
Long-distance services of &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; (DB) are operated by its &quot;DB Fernverkehr&quot; () division:
* InterCity-Express (ICE) – high speed train, largely national but some routes to the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, France, and Denmark
* EuroCity (EC) – international long-distance trains to larger cities in Europe.
* InterCity (IC) – national long-distance trains
* EuroNight (EN) – international night trains

InterRegio services, introduced in 1988 to replace the former &quot;Schnellzug&quot; () and InterCity, were discontinued in Germany in 2003. 

The &quot;UrlaubsExpress&quot; (), national night trains to the Alps and the Baltic Sea during vacation times, were abolished in 2007.

Deutsche Bahn is gradually increasing the percentage of InterCity-Express services and downgrading the remaining InterCity services to the role formerly played by the InterRegio.

=== Long-distance services of other operators ===
* EuroStar Red (previously Thalys) – high-speed services to Belgium and France, using modified French TGV trains.
* Eurocity / InterCity – trains operated by non-German companies that cross the border
* EuroCity-Express (ECE) – on two routes (Frankfurt (Main) – Basel – Milano and Munich – Zurich) since 2020, operated by Swiss Federal Railways (runs as EuroCity/EC in Switzerland and Italy)
* Flixtrain – operates a handful of long distance trains; Flixtrain is a subsidiary of Flixbus, mostly an operator of long distance buses
* RailJet (RJ) – operated by Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB), runs services to Austria 
* NightJet (NJ) – a sleeper train operated by ÖBB to destinations in mainland Europe
* WESTbahn – provides services to Austria

Cisalpino (discontinued in December 2006) provided services to Switzerland and Italy.

Veolia Verkehr (Now merged into Transdev) offered services on certain former InterRegio routes (Harz-Berlin-Express, Ostseeland Express) until 2014.

=== Regional and local ===

Regional and local rail traffic is organised and funded (as the fares usually do not cover the running costs) by the federal states. The usual procedure under EU legislation is to award the contract to the lowest bid by means of a tender procedure. The respective states are free to announce short- or long-term contracts as well as to stipulate further conditions such as on rolling stock. In recent years, many bids have been won by private rail companies like NordWestBahn or Netinera, although some states have awarded long-term contracts to local DB Regio subsidiaries. The train types for regional and local traffic are as follows (see also: List of suburban and commuter rail systems).
*&quot;Regional-Express&quot; (RE) and &quot;InterRegio-Express&quot; (IRE) – medium-distance semi-fast trains for regional services
*&quot;Regionalbahn&quot; (RB) – basic local service, usually calling at all stations
*Metropolexpress (MEX) – local train in the state of Baden-Württemberg
*&quot;S-Bahn&quot; (S) – suburban rail services mostly provided by Deutsche Bahn
*&quot;U-Bahn&quot; (U) – underground train services provided by the various cities&#x27; transport bodies (not Deutsche Bahn)
*Tram () / light rail services – tramways are in place in several cities, in a few major cities these run underground in the city centre (often called &quot;Stadtbahn&quot;, especially if they have been upgraded to railway standards)

Previously, there were also other regional train types, the &quot;Stadt-Express&quot; (SE), formerly named &quot;City-Bahn&quot; (CB).

=== By state ===
== Rail links to adjacent countries ==
Germany has rail links to all of its nine neighbouring nations. These countries use the same mainline gauge (), although electrification (15 kV AC 16.7 Hz) and other systems such as signalling may differ.
* Denmark — voltage change to 25 kV AC 50 Hz
* Poland — voltage change to 3 kV DC
* Czech Republic — voltage change to 3 kV DC
* Austria — same voltage
* Switzerland — same voltage, but different pantographs
* France — voltage change to 25 kV AC 50 Hz (no direct connection to France&#x27;s 1500 V DC network)
* Luxembourg— voltage change to 25 kV AC 50 Hz
* Belgium — voltage change to 3 kV DC
* The Netherlands — voltage change to 1500 V DC or 25 kV AC 50 Hz (at / ; for trains to , a further change to 1500 V DC follows)

There are also train ferries (carrying only goods wagons) between Rostock and Trelleborg (Sweden) across the Baltic Sea. The Lake Constance train ferries linked Germany with Switzerland (1869−1976) and Austria (1884−1917) across Lake Constance ().

=== International passenger trains ===

The table includes operational cross-border services, most of which run either as EuroCity (EC), EuroCity-Express (ECE), InterCity (IC), Intercity-Express (ICE) or &quot;Regionalexpress&quot; (RE). Local border services are not listed.

==History==

The earliest form of railways, wagonways, were developed in Germany in the 16th century. A wagonway operation was illustrated in Germany in 1556 by Georgius Agricola (image right) in his work De re metallica. This line used &quot;Hund&quot; carts with unflanged wheels running on wooden planks and a vertical pin on the cart fitting into the gap between the planks to keep it going the right way. The miners called the wagons &quot;Hunde&quot; (&quot;dogs&quot;) from the noise they made on the tracks. Such wagonways soon became very popular in Europe.

Modern German rail history officially began with the opening of the steam-hauled Bavarian Ludwig Railway between Nuremberg and Fürth on 7 December 1835. The first long distance railway was the Leipzig-Dresden railway, completed on 7 April 1839. The following years saw a rapid growth: By the year 1845, there were already more than of railroads in Germany, and ten years later that number was above 8,000.

German unification in 1871 stimulated consolidation, nationalization into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialization, and so heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight, and forged ahead of France. 1915 Leipzig Hauptbahnhof had become one of the largest stations worldwide. 

Under the Weimar Republic, the &quot;Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen&quot; (later &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot;) was created on 1 April 1920.

During the Second World War, austere versions of the standard locomotives were produced to speed up construction times and minimise the use of imported materials. These were the so-called war locomotives (&quot;Kriegslokomotiven&quot; and &quot;Übergangskriegslokomotiven&quot;). Absent a good highway network and trucks, the Germans relied heavily on the railways, supplemented by slower river and canal transport for bulk goods.

After the war, the German railway system was split into the &quot;Deutsche Bundesbahn&quot; of West Germany and the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; of East Germany.

In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell. Train frequency rapidly increased on the existing East/West corridors; closed links which had formerly crossed the border were re-opened. On 3 October 1990, Germany was reunified; however, this was not immediately the case with the railways. Administrative and organisational problems led to the decision to completely re-organise and reconnect Germany&#x27;s railways. The so-called &quot;Bahnreform&quot; (Railway Reform) came into effect on 1 January 1994, when the two state railways were formally reunited to form the current German Railway Corporation (&quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot;). At the time the &quot;Bahnreform&quot; was seen as a &quot;first step&quot; towards future railway privatization and Deutsche Bahn operates as a joint stock company (AG) even though the federal government owns all stocks. However, plans for privatization were delayed by the Great Recession and ultimately cancelled altogether. The railway sector was however liberalized insofar as Deutsche Bahn lost its railway monopoly status in 1996; regional services are now subject to open bidding (&quot;Regionalisierung&quot; or &quot;regionalization&quot;, as the responsibility for local rail services was transferred from the federal government to the 16 state governments) whereas long distance services are subject to open access operation. However, while the share of DB in the market of regional rail has declined since 1994 - in the context of an overall expanding market of regional rail service - the vast majority of long distance trains are still operated by or in cooperation with Deutsche Bahn AG.

The German railways were long protected from competition from intercity buses on journeys over . However, in 2013, this protection was removed, leading to a significant shift from rail to bus for long journeys.

<doc id="186749" wikidata="Q1060310" url="?curid=186749" title="Narcissistic personality disorder">
<text>Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is a personality disorder characterized by a life-long pattern of exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a diminished ability to empathize with other people&#x27;s feelings. Narcissistic personality disorder is one of the sub-types of the broader category known as personality disorders. It is often comorbid with other mental disorders and associated with significant functional impairment and psychosocial disability.

Personality disorders are a class of mental disorders characterized by enduring and inflexible maladaptive patterns of behavior, cognition, and inner experience, exhibited across many contexts and deviating from those accepted by any culture. These patterns develop by early adulthood, and are associated with significant distress or impairment. Criteria for diagnosing personality disorders are listed in the sixth chapter of the &quot;International Classification of Diseases&quot; (ICD) and in the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM).

There is no standard treatment for NPD. Its high comorbidity with other mental disorders influences treatment choice and outcomes. Psychotherapeutic treatments generally fall into two categories: psychoanalytic/psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral therapy, with growing support for integration of both in therapy. However, there is an almost complete lack of studies determining the effectiveness of treatments. One&#x27;s subjective experience of the mental disorder, as well as their agreement to and level of engagement with treatment, are highly dependent on their motivation to change.

== Signs and symptoms ==
&quot;People with narcissistic personality disorder may exhibit manipulation and feelings of superiority, be grandiose or self-loathing, assertively lead or struggle to hold down a steady job, be model citizens or engage in antisocial behavior, all marked by a profound lack of empathy.&quot;NPD is complex and far from uniform in its presentation and consequences. Empirical evidence suggests several subtypes of NPD may exist (see the Subtypes section below), but in general the disorder is known to have grandiose (&quot;thick-skinned&quot;) and vulnerable (&quot;thin-skinned&quot;) expressions.

Grandiose, thick-skinned NPD patients show a sense of uniqueness or superiority, attitudes of entitlement, a belief that others envy their abilities or status, low empathy, social dominance, superficial charm, disdainfulness or snobbery, and an exploitative interpersonal style characterised by manipulation and selfishness. 

Vulnerable, thin-skinned individuals with NPD also show entitlement, selfishness and low empathy, but uniquely demonstrate feelings of shame and inferiority, are envious of others&#x27; abilities or status, tend to be shy, paranoid, vindictive, and emotionally dependent on admiration, and show extreme rage and hostility in response to rejection and criticism. 

While vulnerable-type patients typically show extreme distress and dysfunction, grandiose variants tend to be associated with &quot;greater&quot; psychological wellbeing, often manifesting dysfunction by occupational conflict, harming others, antisocial behaviour or emotional strain resulting from perfectionism.

It is often theorised that some patients may oscillate between grandiosity and vulnerability. While some evidence suggests that grandiose individuals show occasional reactive anger (a vulnerable trait), but narcissistically vulnerable individuals do not show signs of grandiosity, most studies show the vulnerable individuals show occasional bouts of grandiosity, but narcissistically grandiose individuals show few or no signs of vulnerability.

=== Other features ===
NPD patients may have difficulty accepting help. They may also exhibit vengeful fantasies, as well as violent and antisocial behaviour. They are more likely to try forms of plastic surgery due to a desire to gain attention and to be seen as beautiful. 

Patients with NPD have an impaired ability to recognize facial expressions or mimic emotions, as well as a lower capacity for emotional empathy and emotional intelligence but preserved capacity for cognitive empathy or an impaired theory of mind. People with NPD are less likely to engage in prosocial behavior. They can still act in selfless ways to improve others&#x27; perceptions of them, advance their social status, or if explicitly told to. Despite these characteristics, they are more likely to overestimate their capacity for empathy. Recent work, however, suggests narcissistic empathy deficits may be resolved (at least in part) by instructed perspective-taking.

It is common for people with NPD to have difficult relationships. They may disrespect others&#x27; boundaries or idealize and devalue them. They commonly keep people emotionally distant, and project, deny, or split. NPD individuals manifesting vulnerability tend to become enraged when rejected or criticised, and may degrade, insult, or blame others who disagree with them.

NPD may be associated with reduced insight into symptoms, especially in severe cases. However, work on lower levels of narcissism suggests such individuals are not only aware of their traits but see them in a positive light, and strive to maintain them over time.

== Diagnosis ==
The DSM-5 indicates that: &quot;Many highly successful individuals display personality traits that might be considered narcissistic. Only when these traits are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting, and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress, do they constitute narcissistic personality disorder.&quot; Given the high-function sociability associated with narcissism, some people with NPD might not view such a diagnosis as a functional impairment to their lives. Although overconfidence tends to make people with NPD very ambitious, such a mindset does not necessarily lead to professional high achievement and success, because they refuse to take risks, in order to avoid failure or the appearance of failure. Moreover, the psychological inability to tolerate disagreement, contradiction, and criticism makes it difficult for persons with NPD to work cooperatively or to maintain long-term relationships.

=== DSM-5 ===

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5) describes NPD as possessing at least five of the following nine criteria.

* A grandiose sense of self-importance (exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)
* Preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love
* Believing that they are &quot;special&quot; and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)
* Requiring excessive admiration
* A sense of entitlement (unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with their expectations)
* Being interpersonally exploitative (taking advantage of others to achieve their own ends)
* Lacking empathy (unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others)
* Often being envious of others or believing that others are envious of them
* Showing arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes

Within the DSM-5, NPD is a cluster B personality disorder. Individuals with cluster B personality disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, or erratic. Narcissistic personality disorder is a mental disorder characterized by a life-long pattern of exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive craving for admiration, and a diminished ability to empathize with others&#x27; feelings.

A diagnosis of NPD, like other personality disorders, is made by a qualified healthcare professional in a clinical interview. In the narcissistic personality disorder, there is a fragile sense of self that becomes a view of oneself as exceptional.

Narcissistic personality disorder usually develops either in youth or in early adulthood. True symptoms of NPD are pervasive, are apparent in varied social situations, and are rigidly consistent over time. Severe symptoms of NPD can significantly impair the person&#x27;s mental capabilities to develop meaningful human relationships, such as friendship, kinship, and marriage. Generally, the symptoms of NPD also impair the person&#x27;s psychological abilities to function socially, either at work or at school, or within important societal settings. The DSM-5 indicates that, in order to qualify as symptomatic of NPD, the person&#x27;s manifested personality traits must substantially differ from social norms.

=== ICD-11 and ICD-10 ===

In the &quot;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems&quot;, 11th Edition ICD-11 of the World Health Organization (WHO), all personality disorders are diagnosed under a single title called &quot;personality disorder.” The criteria for diagnosis are mainly concerned with assessing dysfunction, distress, and maladaptive behavior. Once a diagnosis has been made, the clinician then can draw upon five trait domains to describe the particular causes of dysfunction, as these have major implications for potential treatments. NPD, as it currently conceptualised, would correspond more or less entirely to the ICD-11 trait of Dissociality, which includes self-centredness (grandiosity, attention-seeking, entitlement and egocentricity) and lack of empathy (callousness, ruthlessness, manipulativeness, interpersonal exploitativeness, and hostility).

In the previous edition, the ICD-10, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is listed under the category of &quot;other specific personality disorders&quot;, meaning the ICD-10 required that cases otherwise described as NPD in the DSM-5 would only need to meet a general set of diagnostic criteria.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
The occurrence of narcissistic personality disorder presents a high rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders. People with a fragile variant of NPD (see Subtypes) are prone to bouts of psychological depression, often to the degree that meets the clinical criteria for a co-occurring depressive disorder. NPD is associated with the occurrence of bipolar disorder and substance use disorders, especially cocaine use disorder. NPD may also be comorbid or differentiated with the occurrence of other mental disorders, including histrionic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, or paranoid personality disorder. NPD should also be differentiated from mania and hypomania as these cases can also present with grandiosity, but present with different levels of functional impairment. It is common for children and adolescents to display personality traits that resemble NPD, but such occurrences are usually transient, and register below the clinical criteria for a formal diagnosis of NPD.

==Subtypes==
Although the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for NPD has been viewed as homogeneous, there are a variety of subtypes used for classification of NPD. There is poor consensus on how many subtypes exist, but there is broad acceptance that there are at least two: grandiose or overt narcissism, and vulnerable or covert narcissism. However, none of the subtypes of NPD are recognized in the DSM-5 or in the ICD-11.

=== Empirically verified subtypes ===
Some research has indicated the existence of three subtypes of NPD, which can be distinguished by symptom criteria, comorbidity and other clinical criteria. These are as follows:

Grandiose/overt: the group exhibits grandiosity, entitlement, interpersonal exploitativeness and manipulation, pursuit of power and control, lack of empathy and remorse, and marked irritability and hostility. This group was noted for high levels of comorbid antisocial and paranoid personality disorders, substance abuse, externalizing, unemployment and greater likelihood of violence. Of note, Russ et al. observed that this group &quot;do not appear to suffer from underlying feelings of inadequacy or to be prone to negative affect states other than anger&quot;, an observation corroborated by recent research which found this variant to show strong inverse associations with depressive, anxious-avoidant, and dependant/victimised features.

Vulnerable/covert: this variant is defined by feelings of shame, envy, resentment, and inferiority (which is occasionally &quot;masked&quot; by arrogance), entitlement, a belief that one is misunderstood or unappreciated, and excessive reactivity to slights or criticism. This variant is associated with elevated levels of neuroticism, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. In fact, recent research suggests that vulnerable narcissism is mostly the product of dysfunctional levels of neuroticism. Vulnerable narcissism is sometimes comorbid with diagnoses of avoidant, borderline and dependent personality disorders.

High-functioning/exhibitionistic: A third subtype for classifying people with NPD, initially theorized by psychiatrist Glen Gabbard, is termed high functioning or exhibitionistic. This variant has been described as &quot;high functioning narcissists [who] were grandiose, competitive, attention-seeking, and sexually provocative; they tended to show adaptive functioning and utilize their narcissistic traits to succeed.&quot; This group has been found to have relatively few psychological issues and high rates of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, with excessive perfectionism posited as a potential cause for their impairment.

=== Others ===
Oblivious/hypervigilant: Glen Gabbard described two subtypes of NPD in 1989, later referred to as equivalent to, the grandiose and vulnerable subtypes. The first was the &quot;oblivious&quot; subtype of narcissist, equivalent to the grandiose subtype. This group was described as being grandiose, arrogant and thick-skinned, while also exhibiting personality traits of helplessness and emotional emptiness, low self-esteem and shame. These were observed in people with NPD to be expressed as socially avoidant behavior in situations where self-presentation is difficult or impossible, leading to withdrawal from situations where social approval is not given.

The second subtype Gabbard described was termed &quot;hypervigilant&quot;, equivalent to the vulnerable subtype. People with this subtype of NPD were described as having easily hurt feelings, an oversensitive temperament, and persistent feelings of shame.

Communal narcissism: A fourth type is the communal narcissist. Communal narcissism is a form of narcissism that occurs in group settings. It is characterized by an inflated sense of importance and a need for admiration from others. In relation to the grandiose narcissist, a communal narcissist is arrogant and self-motivating, and shares the sense of entitlement and grandiosity. However, the communal narcissist seeks power and admiration in the communal realm. They see themselves as altruistic, saintly, caring, helpful, and warm. Individuals who display communal narcissism often seek out positions of power and influence within their groups.

==== Millon&#x27;s subtypes ====
In the study &quot;Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV-TM and Beyond&quot; (1996), Theodore Millon suggested five subtypes of NPD, although he did not identify specific treatments per subtype.
==== Masterson&#x27;s subtypes (exhibitionist and closet) ====
In 1993, James F. Masterson proposed two subtypes for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. A person with exhibitionist narcissism is similar to NPD described in the DSM-IV and differs from closet narcissism in several ways. A person with closet narcissism is more likely to be described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. A person with exhibitionist narcissism would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of feelings of emptiness. Such a person would assume that their condition was normal and that others were just like them. A person with closet narcissism is described to seek constant approval from others and appears similar to those with borderline personality disorder in the need to please others. A person with exhibitionist narcissism seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.

==== Malignant narcissism ====
Malignant narcissism, a term first coined in Erich Fromm&#x27;s 1964 book &quot;The Heart of Man: Its Genius for Good and Evil&quot;, is a syndrome consisting of a combination of NPD, antisocial personality disorder, and paranoid traits. A person with malignant narcissism was described as deriving higher levels of psychological gratification from accomplishments over time, suspected to worsen the disorder. Because a person with malignant narcissism becomes more involved in psychological gratification, it was suspected to be a risk factor for developing antisocial, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders. The term &quot;malignant&quot; is added to the term &quot;narcissist&quot; to indicate that individuals with this disorder have a severe form of narcissistic disorder that is characterized also by features of paranoia, psychopathy (anti-social behaviors), aggression, and sadism.

==== Historical demarcation of grandiose and vulnerable types ====
Over the years, many clinicians and theorists have described two variants of NPD akin to the grandiose and vulnerable expressions of trait narcissism. Some examples include:
== Assessment and screening ==
=== Narcissistic Personality Inventory ===

Risk factors for NPD and grandiose/overt and vulnerable/covert subtypes are measured using the narcissistic personality inventory, an assessment tool originally developed in 1979, which has undergone multiple iterations with new versions in 1984, 2006 and 2014. It captures principally grandiose narcissism, but also seems to capture elements of vulnerability. A popular three-factor model has it that grandiose narcissism is assessed via the Leadership/Authority and Grandiose/Exhibitionism facets, while a combination of grandiose and vulnerable traits are indexed by the Entitlement/Exploitativeness facet.

=== Pathological Narcissism Inventory ===
The Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) was designed to measure fluctuations in grandiose and vulnerable narcissistic states, similar to what is ostensibly observed by some clinicians (though empirical demonstration of this phenomenon is lacking). While having both &quot;grandiosity&quot; and vulnerability scales, empirically both seem to primarily capture vulnerable narcissism.

The PNI scales show significant associations with parasuicidal behavior, suicide attempts, homicidal ideation, and several aspects of psychotherapy utilization.

=== Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory ===
In 2013, the Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory (FFNI) was defined as a comprehensive assay of grandiose and vulnerable expressions of trait narcissism. The scale measures 11 traits of grandiose narcissism and 4 traits of vulnerable narcissism, both of which correlate with clinical ratings of NPD (with grandiose features of arrogance, grandiose fantasies, manipulativeness, entitlement and exploitativeness showing stronger relations). Later analysis revealed that the FFNI actually measures three factors:

# Agentic Extraversion: an exaggerated sense of self-importance, grandiose fantasies, striving for greatness and acclaim, social dominance and authoritativeness, and exhibitionistic, charming interpersonal conduct.
# Self-Centred Antagonism: disdain for others, psychological entitlement, interpersonally exploitative and manipulative behaviour, lack of empathy, anger in response to criticism or rebuke, suspiciousness, and thrill-seeking.
# Narcissistic Neuroticism: shame-proneness, oversensitivity and negative emotionality to criticism and rebuke, and excessive need for admiration to maintain self-esteem.

Grandiose narcissism is a combination of agency and antagonism, and vulnerability is a combination of antagonism and neuroticism. The three factors show differential associations with clinically important variables. Agentic traits are associated with high self-esteem, positive view others and the future, autonomous and authentic living, commitment to personal growth, sense of purpose in life and life satisfaction. Neurotic traits show precisely the opposite correlation with all of these variables, while antagonistic traits show more complex associations; they are associated with negative view of others (but necessarily of the self), a sense of alienation from their &#x27;true self&#x27;, disinterest in personal growth, negative relationships with others, and all forms of aggression.

=== Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory ===

The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) is another diagnostic test developed by Theodore Millon. The MCMI includes a scale for narcissism. The NPI and MCMI have been found to be well correlated. Whereas the MCMI measures narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), the NPI measures narcissism as it occurs in the general population; the MCMI is a screening tool. In other words, the NPI measures &quot;normal&quot; narcissism; i.e., most people who score very high on the NPI do not have NPD. Indeed, the NPI does not capture any sort of narcissism taxon as would be expected if it measured NPD.

A 2020 study found that females scored significantly higher on vulnerable narcissism than males, but no gender differences were found for grandiose narcissism.

== Causes ==

=== Aetiology ===
The cause of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is unclear, although there is evidence for a strong biological or genetic underpinning. It is unclear if or how much a person&#x27;s upbringing contributes to the development of NPD, although many speculative theories have been proposed.

Evidence to support social factors in the development of NPD is limited. Some studies have found NPD correlates with permissive and overindulgent parenting in childhood, while others have found correlations with harsh discipline, neglect or abuse. Findings have been inconsistent, and scientists do not know if these correlations are causal, as these studies do not control for genetic confounding.

This problem of genetic confounding is explained by psychologist Svenn Torgersen in a 2009 review:

Twin studies allow scientists to assess the influence of genes and environment, in particular, how much of the variation in a trait is attributed to the &quot;shared environment&quot; (influences shared by twins, such as parents and upbringing) or the &quot;unshared environment&quot; (measurement error, noise, differing illnesses between twins, randomness in brain growth, and social or non-social experiences that only one twin experienced). According to a 2018 review, twin studies of NPD have found little or no influence from the shared environment, and a major contribution of genes and the non-shared environment:

According to neurogeneticist Kevin Mitchell, a lack of influence from the shared environment indicates that the non-shared environmental influence may be largely non-social, perhaps reflecting innate processes such as randomness in brain growth.

=== Pathophysiology ===
Neuroscientists have also studied the brains of people with NPD using structural imaging technology. A 2021 review concluded the most consistent finding among NPD patients is lowered gray matter volume in the medial prefrontal cortex, previously associated with self-enhancement tendencies. Studies of the occurrence of narcissistic personality disorder identified structural abnormalities in the brains of people with NPD, specifically, a lesser volume of gray matter in the left, anterior insular cortex. The results of a 2015 study associated the condition of NPD with a reduced volume of gray matter in the prefrontal cortex. It has been suggested that empathic dysfunction and selfish behaviour in NPD may result from dysfunction in the brain&#x27;s salience network (SN; consisting of the anterior insula and cingulate cortices), which switches between internally- and externally-focused cognition, to inhibit the default mode network (DMN), involved in self-related information-processing, during social interactions resulting in continued self-focus even when interacting with distressed others. Consonantly, excessive selfishness in NPD appears to be related to decreased ability of the cingulate cortex to track motivational conflict between self-gain and other-pain.

Grandiose and vulnerable expressions of NPD appear to relate differently to brain structure and function. Specifically, NPD patients with grandiose features show enhanced while those vulnerable features show reduced local efficiency in the DMN. Vulnerable cases of NPD also appear to show increased oxidative stress.

=== Other aspects ===
Evolutionary models of NPD have also been proposed. According to psychologist Marco Del Giudice, cluster B traits including NPD, predict increased mating success and fertility. NPD could potentially be an adaptive evolutionary phenomena, though a risky one that can sometimes result in social rejection and failure to reproduce. Another proposal is that NPD may result from an excess of traits which are only adaptive in moderate amounts (leadership success increases with moderate degrees of narcissism, but declines at the high end of narcissism).

Research on NPD is limited, because patients are hard to recruit for study. The cause of narcissistic personality disorder requires further research.

== Management ==
Treatment for NPD is primarily psychotherapeutic; there is no clear evidence that psychopharmacological treatment is effective for NPD, although it can prove useful for treating comorbid disorders. Psychotherapeutic treatment falls into two general categories: psychoanalytic/psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral. Psychoanalytic therapies include schema therapy, transference focused psychotherapy, mentalization-based treatment and metacognitive psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapies include cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectal behavior therapy. Formats also include group therapy and couples therapy. The specific choice of treatment varies based on individual presentations.

Management of narcissistic personality disorder has not been well studied, however many treatments tailored to NPD exist. Therapy is complicated by the lack of treatment-seeking behavior in people with NPD, despite mental distress. Additionally, people with narcissistic personality disorders have decreased life satisfaction and lower qualities of life, irrespective of diagnosis. People with NPD often present with comorbid mental disorders, complicating diagnosis and treatment. NPD is rarely the primary reason for which people seek mental health treatment. When people with NPD enter treatment (psychologic or psychiatric), they often express seeking relief from a comorbid mental disorder, including major depressive disorder, a substance use disorder (drug addiction), or bipolar disorder.

== Prognosis ==
, no treatment guidelines exist for NPD and no empirical studies have been conducted on specific NPD groups to determine efficacy for psychotherapies and pharmacology.
Though there is no known single cure for NPD, there are some things one can do to lessen its symptoms. Medications such as antidepressants, which treat depression, are commonly prescribed by healthcare providers; mood stabilizers to reduce mood swings and antipsychotic drugs to reduce the prevalence of psychotic episodes.

The presence of NPD in patients undergoing psychotherapy for the treatment of other mental disorders is associated with slower treatment progress and higher dropout rates. In this therapy, the goals often are examining traits and behaviors that negatively affect life, identifying ways these behaviors cause distress to the person and others, exploring early experiences that contributed to narcissistic defenses, developing new coping mechanisms to replace those defenses, helping the person see themselves and others in more realistic and nuanced ways, rather than wholly good or wholly bad, identifying and practicing more helpful patterns of behavior, developing interpersonal skills, and learning to consider the needs and feelings of others.

== Epidemiology ==
, overall prevalence is estimated to range from 0.8% to 6.2%. In 2008 under the DSM-IV, lifetime prevalence of NPD was estimated to be 6.2%, with 7.7% for men and 4.8% for women, with a 2015 study confirming the gender difference. In clinical settings, prevalence estimates range from 1% to 15%. The occurrence of narcissistic personality disorder presents a high rate of comorbidity with other mental disorders.

== History ==
The term &quot;narcissism&quot; comes from the first century (written in the year 8 AD) narrative poem the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; by the Roman poet Ovid. Book III of the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; features a myth about two main characters, Narcissus and Echo. Narcissus is a handsome young man who spurns the advances of many potential lovers. When Narcissus rejects Echo, a nymph cursed to only echo the sounds that others made, the goddess Nemesis punishes him by making him fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. When Narcissus discovers that the object of his love cannot love him back, he slowly pines away and dies.

The concept of excessive selfishness has been recognized throughout history. In ancient Greece, the concept was understood as hubris. It is only since the late 1800s that narcissism has been defined in psychological terms:

*Havelock Ellis (1898) was the first psychologist to use the term when he linked the myth to the condition in one of his patients.
*Sigmund Freud (1905–1953) used the terms &quot;narcissistic libido&quot; in his &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot;.
*Ernest Jones (1913/1951) was the first to construe extreme narcissism as a character flaw.
*Robert Waelder (1925) published the first case study of narcissism. His patient was a successful scientist with an attitude of superiority, an obsession with fostering self-respect, and a lack of normal feelings of guilt. The patient was aloof and independent from others and had an inability to empathize with others&#x27; situations, and was selfish sexually. Waelder&#x27;s patient was also overly logical and analytical and valued abstract intellectual thought (thinking for thinking&#x27;s sake) over the practical application of scientific knowledge.

Narcissistic personality was first described by the psychoanalyst Robert Waelder in 1925. The term &quot;narcissistic personality disorder&quot; (NPD) was coined by Heinz Kohut in 1968. Waelder&#x27;s initial study has been influential in the way narcissism and the clinical disorder Narcissistic personality disorder are defined today

=== Freudianism and psychoanalysis ===
Much of the early history of narcissism and NPD originates from psychoanalysis. Regarding the adult neurotic&#x27;s sense of omnipotence, Sigmund Freud said that &quot;this belief is a frank acknowledgement of a relic of the old megalomania of infancy&quot;; and concluded that: &quot;we can detect an element of megalomania in most other forms of paranoic disorder. We are justified in assuming that this megalomania is essentially of an infantile nature, and that, as development proceeds, it is sacrificed to social considerations.&quot;

&quot;Narcissistic injury&quot; and &quot;narcissistic scar&quot; are terms used by Freud in the 1920s. &quot;Narcissistic wound&quot; and &quot;narcissistic blow&quot; are other, almost interchangeable, terms. When wounded in the ego, either by a real or a perceived criticism, a narcissistic person&#x27;s displays of anger can be disproportionate to the nature of the criticism suffered; but typically, the actions and responses of the NPD person are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of personal insecurity, the inflated self-concept of the NPD person is primarily stable.

In &quot;The Psychology of Gambling&quot; (1957), Edmund Bergler considered megalomania to be a normal occurrence in the psychology of a child, a condition later reactivated in adult life, if the individual takes up gambling. In &quot;The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis&quot; (1946), Otto Fenichel said that people who, in their later lives, respond with denial to their own narcissistic injury usually undergo a similar regression to the megalomania of childhood.

==== Narcissistic supply ====
Narcissistic supply was a concept introduced by Otto Fenichel in 1938, to describe a type of admiration, interpersonal support, or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and essential to their self-esteem. The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or excessive need for attention or admiration that does not take into account the feelings, opinions, or preferences of other people.

==== Narcissistic rage ====
The term &quot;narcissistic rage&quot; was a concept introduced by Heinz Kohut in 1972. Narcissistic rage was theorised as a reaction to a perceived threat to a narcissist&#x27;s self-esteem or self-worth. Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from aloofness, to expressions of mild irritation or annoyance, to serious outbursts, including violent attacks.

Narcissistic rage reactions are not necessarily limited to narcissistic personality disorder. They may also be seen in catatonic, paranoid delusion, and depressive episodes. It was later suggested that narcissistic people have two layers of rage; the first layer of rage being directed constant anger towards someone else, with the second layer being self-deprecating.

=== Object relations ===
In the second half of the 20th century, in contrast to Freud&#x27;s perspective of megalomania as an obstacle to psychoanalysis, in the US and UK Kleinian psychologists used the object relations theory to re-evaluate megalomania as a defence mechanism. This Kleinian therapeutic approach built upon Heinz Kohut&#x27;s view of narcissistic megalomania as an aspect of normal mental development, by contrast with Otto Kernberg&#x27;s consideration of such grandiosity as a pathological distortion of normal psychological development.

To the extent that people are pathologically narcissistic, the person with NPD can be a self-absorbed individual who passes blame by psychological projection and is intolerant of contradictory views and opinions; is apathetic towards the emotional, mental, and psychological needs of other people; and is indifferent to the negative effects of their behaviors, whilst insisting that people should see them as an ideal person. The merging of the terms &quot;inflated self-concept&quot; and &quot;actual self&quot;&quot;&quot; is evident in later research on the grandiosity component of narcissistic personality disorder, along with incorporating the defence mechanisms of idealization and devaluation and of denial.

=== Comparison to other personality disorders ===
NPD mainly overlaps with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD), and Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) as all are &quot;Cluster B&quot; disorders. Cluster B personality disorders are characterized by impulsivity, an inability to regulate emotions, and a difficulty maintaining social relationships. Because these personality disorders share symptoms and behaviors with NPD, many are also comorbid with NPD.

Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized as having an instability in emotions, relationships, and self image. The presence of BPD is also highly associated with traits such grandiosity, lack of empathy, and praise-seeking behaviors which are characteristic of NPD. Research has shown that BPD does, in fact, have high comorbidity rates with NPD.

Antisocial Personality Disorder is similarly characterized by impulsivity and a lack of empathy, but also by a disregard for the rights of others and a tendency to manipulate others. Additionally, both antisociality and narcissism are heavily correlated with psychopathy, further suggesting an overlap between the two.

== Controversy ==
The extent of controversy about narcissism was on display when the committee on personality disorders for the 5th Edition (2013) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders recommended the removal of Narcissistic Personality from the manual. A contentious three-year debate unfolded in the clinical community with one of the sharpest critics being John Gunderson, who led the DSM personality disorders committee for the 4th edition of the manual.

The American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s (APA) formulation, description, and definition of narcissistic personality disorder, as published in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, Fourth Ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR, 2000), was criticised by clinicians as inadequately describing the range and complexity of the personality disorder that is NPD. That it is excessively focused upon &quot;the narcissistic individual&#x27;s external, symptomatic, or social interpersonal patterns – at the expense of ... internal complexity and individual suffering&quot;, which reduced the clinical utility of the NPD definition in the DSM-IV-TR.

In revising the diagnostic criteria for personality disorders, the work group for the list of &quot;Personality and Personality Disorders&quot; proposed the elimination of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) as a distinct entry in the DSM-5, and thus replaced a categorical approach to NPD with a dimensional approach, which is based upon the severity of the dysfunctional-personality-trait domains. Clinicians critical of the DSM-5 revision characterized the new diagnostic system as an &quot;unwieldy conglomeration of disparate models that cannot happily coexist&quot;, which is of limited usefulness in clinical practice. Despite the reintroduction of the NPD entry, the APA&#x27;s re-formulation, re-description, and re-definition of NPD, towards a dimensional view based upon personality traits, remains in the list of personality disorders of the DSM-5.

A 2011 study concluded that narcissism should be conceived as personality dimensions pertinent to the full range of personality disorders, rather than as a distinct diagnostic category. In a 2012 literature review about NPD, the researchers concluded that narcissistic personality disorder &quot;shows nosological inconsistency, and that its consideration as a trait domain needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field.&quot; In a 2018 latent structure analysis, results suggested that the DSM-5 NPD criteria fail to distinguish some aspects of narcissism relevant to diagnosis of NPD and subclinical narcissism.

==In popular culture==
* Suzanne Stone-Maretto, Nicole Kidman&#x27;s character in the film &quot;To Die For&quot; (1995), wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted that she &quot;was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder&quot;.
* Jay Gatsby, the eponymous character of F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925), &quot;an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join high society&quot;, has been described by English professor Giles Mitchell as a &quot;pathological narcissist&quot; for whom the &quot;ego-ideal&quot; has become &quot;inflated and destructive&quot; and whose &quot;grandiose lies, poor sense of reality, sense of entitlement, and exploitive treatment of others&quot; conspire toward his own demise.

<doc id="186750" wikidata="Q940030" url="?curid=186750" title="Arrakis">
<text>Arrakis ()—informally known as Dune and later called Rakis—is a fictional desert planet featured in the &quot;Dune&quot; series of novels by Frank Herbert. Herbert&#x27;s first novel in the series, 1965&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, is considered one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time, and it is sometimes cited as the best-selling science fiction novel in history.

In &quot;Dune&quot;, Arrakis is the most important planet in the universe, as it is the only source of the drug melange. Melange (or, &quot;the spice&quot;) is the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe, as it extends life and makes safe interstellar travel possible (among other uses). Harvesting the spice is also hazardous in the extreme, due to both the harsh climate of the planet and the fact that melange deposits are guarded by giant sandworms.

Arrakis is also the home of the Fremen (Zensunni wanderers), and subsequently is the Imperial Capital of the Atreides Empire. Arrakis is the third planet orbiting the star Canopus, and it in turn is orbited by two moons, one of which has an albedo pattern resembling the desert kangaroo mouse, Muad&#x27;Dib, on it; the other moon has markings resembling a human hand.

==Environment and the spice==
A desert planet with no natural precipitation, in &quot;Dune&quot; it is established that Arrakis had been &quot;His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Desert Botanical Testing Station&quot; before the discovery of melange, for which it is the only natural source in the universe. Melange (or, &quot;the spice&quot;) is the most essential and valuable commodity in the universe, as it extends life and makes safe interstellar travel possible (among other uses). The planet has no surface water bodies, but open canals called qanats are used &quot;for carrying irrigation water under controlled conditions&quot; through the desert. The Fremen collect water in underground reservoirs to fulfill their dream of someday terraforming the planet, and pay the Spacing Guild exorbitant fees in melange to keep the skies over Arrakis free of any satellites which might observe their efforts. As indicated by its large salt flats, Arrakis once had lakes and oceans; Lady Jessica also notes in &quot;Dune&quot; that wells drilled in the sinks and basins initially produce a &quot;trickle&quot; of water which soon stops, as if &quot;something plugs it.&quot;

Paul Atreides recalls that the few plants and animals on the planet include &quot;saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote bush ... kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse ... many to be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.&quot; The most notable life forms on the planet are the giant sandworms and their immature forms of sandtrout and sand plankton. Sandtrout encyst any water deposits; predator fish are placed in the qanats and other water storage areas to protect them from the sandtrout. It is suggested the sandworms are an introduced species that caused the desertification of Arrakis; In &quot;Children of Dune&quot; (1976), Leto II Atreides explains to his twin sister Ghanima:
The sandtrout [...] was introduced here from some other place. This was a wet planet then. They proliferated beyond the capability of existing ecosystems to deal with them. Sandtrout encysted the available free water, made this a desert planet [...] and they did it to survive. In a planet sufficiently dry, they could move to their sandworm phase.

The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the hydrocarbon (ie. oil and/or natural gas) wealthy Mexico and the Middle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made it resemble a generic desertified petrostate.

==Inhabitants==

The Zensunni wanderers, driven from planet to planet, eventually found their way to Arrakis, where they became the Fremen. They settled in artificial cave-like settlements known as sietches across the Arrakeen deserts. They also developed stillsuit technology, allowing them to survive in the open desert. By harvesting melange, they were able to bribe the Spacing Guild for privacy from observation and weather control in order to hide from the Imperium their true population and their plans to terraform Arrakis. Much of this ecological activity took place in the unexplored southern latitudes of the planet. The best-known of the sietches is Sietch Tabr, home of Stilgar and Muad&#x27;Dib&#x27;s center of operations before victory in the Battle of Arrakeen put Muad&#x27;Dib on the Imperial throne.

According to the &quot;Legends of Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, it was a group of Zensunni wanderers escaping slavery on the planet Poritrin who originally crashed on Dune in a prototype interstellar spacecraft several years prior to the creation of the Spacing Guild.

==Plotlines==
During the events of &quot;Dune&quot;, the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV grants Duke Leto Atreides control of the lucrative spice harvesting operations of Arrakis, ousting the Atreides&#x27; longtime rivals, the Harkonnens. The Atreides rule is cut short by a murderous conspiracy crafted by the Harkonnens and the Emperor himself. Leto&#x27;s son Paul Atreides (known by the Fremen as Muad&#x27;Dib) later leads a massive Fremen army to victory over the Emperor&#x27;s Sardaukar soldier-fanatics, and by threatening the destruction of all spice production on Arrakis manages to depose Shaddam and ascend the throne in his place. With Emperor Paul worshipped as a god, Arrakis becomes the governmental and religious center of the Imperium.

Paul Muad&#x27;Dib continues the efforts to terraform Arrakis into a green world, a plan begun by the Fremen under the guidance of Imperial Planetologist Pardot Kynes and his son Liet-Kynes. The core of their plan is gradual water-collection from the Arrakeen atmosphere to form large reservoirs that would, eventually, become lakes and oceans. Much of this activity takes place in the unexplored southern latitudes of Arrakis.

By the time of &quot;Children of Dune&quot;, Alia Atreides (and then Leto II and Ghanima) realize that the ecological transformation of Arrakis is altering the sandworm cycle, which would eventually result in the end of all spice production. This at first seems a future to be avoided, but Leto II later uses this eventuality as part of his Golden Path to ultimately save humanity. Once he himself begins the transformation into a human/sandworm hybrid, he eradicates all desert on Arrakis except for a small area he makes his base of operations, and destroys all of the sandworms save one—himself.

After his death some 3,500 years later in &quot;God Emperor of Dune&quot;, Leto&#x27;s worm-body is transformed back into sandtrout. Within only a few centuries, these sandtrout return Arrakis (thence called &#x27;Rakis&#x27;) to a desert.

In &quot;Heretics of Dune&quot;, all life on Arrakis is destroyed (and the entire surface of the planet slagged into oblivion) by the Honored Matres in a failed attempt to eliminate the latest Duncan Idaho ghola. The Bene Gesserit escape with a single sandworm, and drown it to revert the worm back into sandtrout. In &quot;&quot;, the Bene Gesserit use these sandtrout to begin a new sandworm cycle on their homeworld of Chapterhouse, which is terraformed into desert for this purpose.

Finally, in &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;, some sandworms are revealed to be alive and well, having sensed the upper crust would be destroyed, and therefore burrowed even deeper, escaping the blast.

==Cities and features==

The capital of Arrakis and its long-time seat of planetary government is Arrakeen (). Leto I describes it as &quot;a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.&quot; He and his family take up residence in the ostentatious palace previously occupied by the planetary governor Count Fenring and his wife Margot during the Harkonnen period of stewardship over Arrakis. In &quot;Dune&quot;, Leto&#x27;s concubine Lady Jessica has this first impression of the Great Hall:
Arrakeen would go through multiple transformations over time; it first becomes an Imperial capital of staggering proportions under Paul Muad&#x27;Dib. It is later transformed into a festival city known as Onn, explicitly for the worship of the Tyrant Leto II. Finally, in the centuries after his death, it is known as Keen, a modern (though still impressive) city to house the Priesthood of Rakis.

===Sietch Tabr===
In &quot;Dune&quot;, Sietch Tabr is a major Fremen sietch originally led by Naib Stilgar. Paul Atreides and his mother Lady Jessica, safely escaping from the Harkonnen attack, come upon Sietch Tabr and are eventually accepted into the community. In these Fremen Paul finds an incomparable fighting force who are already disgruntled by Imperial rule. He shapes them into a resistance movement that eventually takes control of Arrakis, allowing Paul to depose the Emperor. Paul moves his base of operations to Arrakeen, but Sietch Tabr remains a center of Fremen culture and politics, as well as a religiously significant site for those who worship Paul as a messiah. All Fremen sietches but one are abandoned after the terraforming of Arrakis, their exact locations remaining a mystery for thousands of years.

===The Keep===
During the reign of Muad&#x27;Dib until the ascension of his son Leto II, the Atreides home-base was a colossal megastructure in Arrakeen, designed to intimidate, known as the Keep. In &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;, the fortress is described as being large enough to enclose entire cities.

===Grand Palace of Arrakeen===
In his 1985 short work &quot;The Road to Dune&quot; (published in the short story collection &quot;Eye&quot;), Frank Herbert described the Grand Palace of Arrakeen (and other sites) during the reign of Paul Atreides:
Your walking tour of Arrakis must include this approach across the dunes to the Grand Palace at Arrakeen. From a distance, the dimensions of this construction are deceptive [...] The largest man-made structure ever built, the Grand Palace could cover more than ten of the Imperium&#x27;s most populous cities under one roof, a fact that becomes more apparent when you learn Atreides attendants and their families, housed spaciously in the Palace Annex, number some thirty-five million souls [...] When you walk into the Grand Reception Hall of the Palace at Arrakeen, be prepared to feel dwarfed before an immensity never before conceived. A statue of St. Alia Atreides, shown as &quot;The Soother of Pains,&quot; stands twenty-two meters tall but is one of the smallest adornments in the hall. Two hundred such statues could be stacked one atop the other against the entrance pillars and still fall short of the doorway&#x27;s capitol arch, which itself is almost a thousand meters below the first beams upholding the lower roof.

===Temple of Alia===
Alia&#x27;s Fane (or Alia&#x27;s Temple) is the two-kilometer wide temple Paul-Muad&#x27;Dib built for his sister Alia between the events of &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. Herbert described it in &quot;The Road to Dune&quot;:
If you are numbered among &quot;the heartfelt pilgrims,&quot; you will cross the last thousand meters of this approach to the Temple of Alia on your knees. Those thousand meters fall well within the sweeping curves leading your eyes up to the transcendent symbols dedicating this Temple to St. Alia of the Knife. The famed &quot;Sun-Sweep Window&quot; incorporates every solar calendar known to human history in the one translucent display whose brilliant colors, driven by the sun of Dune, thread through the interior on prismatic pathways.

===The Citadel of Leto II===
The Tyrant Leto II rules the universe from the Citadel, a fortress built in the Last Desert of the Sareer. The Sareer is flanked by the Forbidden Forest, home of the ferocious D-wolves, the guardians of the Sareer. Beyond that lies the Idaho River, across which a bridge spans that leads to the festival city of Onn (once Arrakeen). Mount Idaho had been completely demolished to provide the raw materials to build the high walls surrounding the Sareer. The Citadel itself is taken apart in the Famine Times after the death of Leto II in search of his alleged hoard of spice.

===Other locations===
All Imperial cities on Arrakis are in the far-northern latitudes of the planet and protected from the violent weather of Arrakis by a natural formation known as the Shield Wall. When the Harkonnens controlled the planet, they ruled from the Harkonnen-built &quot;megalopolis&quot; of Carthag, described by Jessica as &quot;a cheap and brassy place some two hundred kilometers northeast across the Broken Land.&quot; Arrakeen was merely the titular capital until the arrival of the Atreides.

There are other cities scattered in the northern regions of the planet (especially near the ice cap, where water is harvested), as well as the Fremen sietch communities scattered throughout the desert.

Other notable sites on Arrakis throughout its history include Observatory Mountain, Mount Idaho, Dar-es-balat and the Kynes Sea.

==Prequels==
The novel &quot;Paul of Dune&quot; (2008) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson establishes that the first known inhabitants of Arrakis had been the Muadru, who introduced the sandworms to the planet. They had settlements all over the galaxy which suddenly disappeared; the Zensunni Wanderers came later, ultimately becoming the Fremen. In the novel Paul notes, &quot;There appears to be a linguistic connection between the Fremen and the Muadru.&quot;

==Namesakes==
* On April 5, 2010, a real-world planitia (plain) on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan was named Arrakis Planitia after Herbert&#x27;s fictional planet, under the naming convention for Titanian planitia (which are all named for planets in Frank Herbert&#x27;s works).
* Arrakis is also an alternative name for the star Mu Draconis.
* The fictional desert planet of Tatooine in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise was inspired by the desert planet of Arrakis in &quot;Dune&quot;.

== Analysis ==
The significance of Arrakis has been discussed in the context of ecocriticism and ecofiction as well as in the context of influences of Arabic culture on modern popular culture.

<text>The Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) or Himalayan griffon vulture is an Old World vulture native to the Himalayas and foothills in North and Northeastern India, as well as the adjacent Tibetan Plateau. After the cinereous vulture (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), it is the second-largest Old World vulture species, and among the world&#x27;s largest true raptors. It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List. It is not to be confused with the Eurasian griffon vulture (&quot;Gyps fulvus&quot;), which is a visually similar, sympatric species.

==Description==


The Himalayan vulture has dark brown greater covert feathers, tail and wing quills, but a pale buff uniform upperside and paler tipped inner secondaries; its legs are covered with buffy feathers and vary in colour from greenish grey to pale brown. The underside and under-wing coverts are pale brown or buff, almost white in some individuals. The whitish down on the head of immatures changes to yellowish in adults who have a long and pale brown ruff with white streaks and long and spiky ruff feathers.

The pale blue facial skin is lighter than the dark blue in &quot;Gyps fulvus&quot; with this species having a yellowish bill. In flight the long fingers are splayed and there is a pale patagial stripe on the underwing. The wing and tail feathers are dark and contrast with the pale coverts and body, one of the best methods to distinguish this species from the slightly smaller griffon vulture. The feathers on the body have pale shaft streaks.

It is the largest of the &quot;Gyps&quot; species, averaging larger in every method of measurement than its relatives, and is perhaps the largest and heaviest bird in the Himalayas.
Weight in Himalayan vultures ranges from to . It has been estimated to weigh an average of , but weights vary with conditions from . Published measurements of the wingspan vary from , a similar range to that of cinereous vulture, but the wingspan varies greatly depending on the method used to measure them.

It differs from the similar-coloured Indian vulture (&quot;G. indicus&quot;) by a stouter, more robust bill; younger birds have a pale bill and tend to have buffy-white streaks on the scapulars and wing coverts contrasting with dark brown underparts. It is similar in size to the cinereous vulture (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;), which typically has a slightly shorter overall length but can weigh more than the Himalayan vulture.

==Distribution==

The Himalayan vulture lives mainly in the higher regions of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau at the elevation range of . It is distributed from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Iran to Pakistan to India, Nepal, Bhutan to western China and Mongolia. Juvenile birds may however disperse further south, and vagrants have been recorded in Thailand, Burma, Singapore and Cambodia.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Diet===
The Himalayan vulture perches on crags, favourite sites showing white marks from regular defecation. They tend to not range below an elevation of . Himalayan vultures often bask in the sun on rocks. They soar in thermals and are not capable of sustained flapping flight. Flocks may follow grazers up the mountains in their search for dead animals. This vulture makes a rattling sound when descending on a carcass and can grunt or hiss at roosts or when feeding on carrion. While feeding, individuals may make cackling sounds to defend their food from other vultures or even reprimand them. They are social birds, and are hence found in large flocks, while even being accompanied by crows (observed with other vulture species as well). Such crows cannot interfere with the flocks (as vultures are physically larger and stronger than crows), but vehicular traffic, human interference, and attacks from herding dogs can pose a disturbance. 

They have been recorded eating carrion exclusively, some which is fed on even when putrid. On the Tibetan Plateau, it was noted that 64% of their diet was obtained from deceased domestic yak (&quot;Bos grunniens&quot;). The birds fed on old carcasses, sometimes even waiting for several days near a dead animal. However, each vulture species has a specialty diet: Himalayan vultures largely disdain offal (which is readily eaten by other vulture species), typically eating only fleshy tissue. Historically, Himalayan vultures regularly fed on human corpses left out on Celestial burial grounds. 

The Himalayan vulture is fairly defensive around other scavengers, such as foxes or smaller felines, and typically dominates other meat-eaters at carcasses, though it is subservient to gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), snow leopards (&quot;Panthera uncia&quot;) and cinereous vultures (&quot;Aegypius monachus&quot;). In a large party, these vultures can reportedly strip a carcass of all tissue in 30 minutes, and do the same to a yak carcass in roughly 120 minutes. Himalayan vultures have been observed feeding on pine (&quot;Pinus roxburghii&quot;) needles, an unexplained behaviour that cannot be for obtaining nutrition, but may be done to access essential oils and terpenes in the needles for digestive or immunity benefits.

===Breeding===
The breeding season begins in January. The nest is a platform of sticks placed on an inaccessible ledge on a cliff. Nest in northeastern India have been recorded at between in elevation, but those in Tibet have been as high as . Several pairs may nest on the same cliff face, with between five and seven pairs being a typical colony size. The nests are relatively small for the large size of these birds and, although grow larger with repeated uses, do not generally get as massive as the nest of other large accipitrids. There is at least one recorded instance of Himalayan vultures using a nest made by bearded vultures (&quot;Gypaetus barbatus&quot;). On the Tibetan Plateau, Himalayan and bearded vultures were observed nesting in close proximity without conflict, which is notable because in several other cases of adjacent interspecies nesting by Old World vultures (including some involving bearded vultures) have resulted in high aggression and interspecies attacks. A single white egg marked with red splotches is the usual clutch. Egg laying dates in northern India have ranged from December 25 to March 7. The egg is coarse and oval and can measure from in height and in width, with an average of . In captivity the incubation period was about 54–58 days. The young birds stay on with the parents for six to seven months.

==Threats==

Himalayan vultures are susceptible to toxicity induced by diclofenac, a drug whose residues in domestic animal carcasses has led to rapid declines in populations of other &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures across Asia. The Himalayan griffon vulture populations have however not shown signs of rapid decline, although reductions in nesting birds have been noted in some parts of its range in Nepal.

<doc id="186758" wikidata="Q849459" url="?curid=186758" title="Dispensationalism">
<text>Dispensationalism is a theological framework for interpreting the Bible which maintains that history is divided into multiple ages called &quot;dispensations&quot; in which God interacts with his chosen people in different ways. It is often distinguished from covenant theology. These are two competing frameworks of biblical theology that attempt to explain overall continuity in the Bible. Coining of the term &quot;dispensationalism&quot; has been attributed to Philip Mauro, a critic of the system&#x27;s teachings, in his 1928 book &quot;The Gospel of the Kingdom&quot;.

Dispensationalists use a literal interpretation of the Bible and believe that divine revelation unfolds throughout the Bible. They believe that there is a distinction between Israel and the Church, and that Christians are not bound by Mosaic law. They maintain beliefs in premillennialism, Christian Zionism, and a rapture of the Church that will happen before the Second Coming of Christ, generally seen as happening before a period of tribulation.

Dispensationalism was systematized and promoted by John Nelson Darby and the Plymouth Brethren in the mid-19th century. It began its spread in the United States during the late 19th century through the efforts of evangelists such as James Inglis, James Hall Brookes and Dwight L. Moody, the programs of the Niagara Bible Conference, and the establishment of Bible institutes. With the dawn of the 20th century, Cyrus Scofield introduced the &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot;, which crystalized dispensationalism in the United States.

Dispensationalism has become popular within American evangelicalism. It is commonly found in nondenominational Bible churches, as well as Baptist, Pentecostal, and Charismatic groups. Protestant denominations that embrace covenant theology tend to reject dispensationalism. According to the system&#x27;s critics, most theologians acknowledge that there is no specific sequence of end-times events defined in the Bible. The Scofield Bible has been called &quot;the most dangerous heresy currently to be found within Christian circles&quot;.

== Overview ==
Dispensationalism is a theological framework that views history as divided into distinct periods in which God interacts with mankind in specific ways. Scofield, in his &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot;, defined a &quot;dispensation&quot; as &quot;a period of time during which man is tested in respect of obedience to some &quot;specific&quot; revelation of the will of God&quot;. 

Charles Ryrie took issue with Scofield&#x27;s definition as too simple, stating that such a definition opened the system to attack from nondispensationalists. Ryrie separates the term &quot;age&quot; from &quot;dispensation,&quot; stating that the two terms are not synonymous in meaning while defining a &quot;dispensation&quot; as &quot;a distinguishable economy in the outworking of God&#x27;s purpose&quot;. He further suggests that the defining characteristics of a dispensation are the distinct governing relationship in which God interacts with mankind during that period, and the resulting responsibility placed upon mankind in that period.

Evangelical Christians generally agree that there are distinct periods in God&#x27;s plan for humanity. Dispensationalist theologians tend to hold &quot;a particular view of the parallel-but-separate roles and destinies of Israel and the [Christian] church&quot;, with a &quot;careful separation ... between what is addressed to Israel and what is addressed to the church. What is addressed to Israel is &#x27;earthly&#x27; in character and is to be interpreted &#x27;literally&#x27;.&quot; 

This view is distinct from covenant theology, which holds that rather than having separate plans, &quot;God has one people, one people of God throughout redemptive history, called &#x27;Israel&#x27; under the Old Testament, and called &#x27;the church&#x27; under the New.&quot;

Philip Mauro, a critic of the system&#x27;s teachings in his 1928 book &quot;The Gospel of the Kingdom&quot;, is considered to be the first to coin the term &quot;dispensationalism&quot; to describe the theological framework that had made inroads into fundamentalism, calling it &quot;a subtle form of modernism&quot;.

=== Typical divisions ===
The number of dispensations may vary from three to eight, but the typical seven-dispensation scheme is as follows:
* Innocence – Adam under probation prior to the Fall of Man. Ends with expulsion from the Garden of Eden in Genesis 3. Some refer to this period as the Adamic period or the dispensation of the Adamic covenant or Adamic law.
* Conscience – From the Fall to the Great Flood. Ends with the worldwide deluge.
* Human or Civil Government – After the Great Flood, humanity is responsible to enact the death penalty, and has the authority to govern. Ends with the dispersion at the Tower of Babel. Some use the term &quot;Noahide law&quot; in reference to this period of dispensation.
* Promise or Patriarchal Rule – From Abraham to Moses. Ends with the refusal to enter Canaan and the 40 years of unbelief in the wilderness. Some use the terms &quot;Abrahamic law&quot; or &quot;Abrahamic covenant&quot; in reference to this period of dispensation.
* Law – From Moses to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Ends with the scattering of Israel in AD 70. Some use the term &quot;Mosaic law&quot; in reference to this period of dispensation.
* Grace – From the cross to the rapture of the church seen by some groups as being described in 1 Thessalonians and the Book of Revelation. The rapture is followed by the wrath of God, constituting the Great Tribulation. Some use the term &quot;Age of Grace&quot; or &quot;the Church Age&quot; for this dispensation.
* Millennial Kingdom – A literal 1000 year reign of Christ on earth (), centered in Jerusalem, ending with God&#x27;s judgment on the final rebellion.

=== Variants ===

*Classic dispensationalism
*Ultradispensationalism (Bullingerism)
* Hyperdispensationalism (Mid-Acts dispensationalism)
* Revised dispensationalism
* Progressive dispensationalism

==Theology==

=== Purpose of God in the world ===
According to John Walvoord, God&#x27;s purpose in the world is to manifest his glory. Charles Ryrie writes that dispensational soteriology focuses on man&#x27;s salvation as the means God uses to glorify himself.

=== Biblical literalism ===
A key element of dispensationalism is its use of the historical-grammatical hermeneutic to obtain a consistent, literal interpretation of the text. In this method, scripture is to be interpreted according to the normal rules of human language in its entirety. This leads dispensationalists to take eschatological passages in the Bible literally. Charles Ryrie suggests that a non-literal hermeneutic is the reason amillennialists apply Old Testament promises made to Israel &quot;spiritually&quot; to the church, and covenant premillennialists see some prophecies as fulfilled and others as not.

===Progressive revelation===
Progressive revelation is the doctrine that each successive book of the Bible provides further revelation of God and his program. Theologian Charles Hodge wrote that the progressive character of divine revelation is gradually unfolded until the fullness of truth is revealed. Charles Ryrie wrote that the Bible is not viewed as a textbook on theology, but rather as a continually unfolding revelation of God through successive ages where there are distinguishable stages in which God introduces mankind to new responsibilities.

Covenant theology and dispensationalist theology disagree regarding the meaning of revelation. Covenant theology views the New Testament as the key to interpreting the Old Testament. For dispensationalists, the Old Testament is interpreted on its own and the New Testament contains new information which can build on the Old Testament but cannot change its meaning. Each stands alone, rather than the Old Testament being reread through the lens of the New Testament.

===Distinction between Israel and the Church===
Dispensationalists see a historic and demographic distinction between Israel and the Christian Church. For them, Israel is an ethnic nation consisting of Hebrews (Israelites), beginning with Abraham. The Church, on the other hand, consists of all saved individuals from the &quot;birth of the Church&quot; in the book of Acts until the time of the rapture. Classic dispensationalists refer to this period as a &quot;parenthesis&quot;, a temporary interlude in the progress of Israel&#x27;s prophesied history when God has paused his dealing with Israel and is dealing with his Church.

There are differing views within dispensationalism as to when the church age began. Classic dispensationalism considers Pentecost in Acts 2 to be the beginning of the Church as distinct from Israel. Charles Finney wrote in 1839 that Pentecost was &quot;the commencement of a new dispensation&quot;, emphasizing the role of the Holy Spirit as a distinction. Cyrus Scofield did not make Pentecost itself the turning point, but did emphasize its role in dividing the dispensations of &quot;Law&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot;. In contrast, hyperdispensationalists suggest that the church started later in Acts (&quot;Mid-Acts&quot;) with the ministry of Paul, identifying the start of the church as occurring between the salvation of Saul in Acts 9 and the Holy Spirit&#x27;s commissioning of Paul in Acts 13. E. W. Bullinger and the ultradispensationalists taught that the church began in Acts 28. According to progressive dispensationalism, the distinction between Israel and the Church is not mutually exclusive, as there is a recognized overlap between the two. The overlap includes Jewish Christians like James, brother of Jesus, who integrated Jesus&#x27;s teachings into the Jewish faith, and Christians of Jewish ethnicity who held varying opinions on compliance with Mosaic law, like Saint Peter and Paul the Apostle. Progressive dispensationalism &quot;softens&quot; the Church/Israel distinction by seeing some Old Testament promises as expanded by the New Testament to include the Church without replacing the promises to its original audience, Israel.

=== The Law ===
Dispensationalists believe that Christ abolished the Mosaic law, and thus it does not apply to the Christian. Instead, the Christian is under the Law of Christ, which embodies moral principles from God that are in both codes. In this view, although many commandments of the Old Testament are re-established in the New Testament, only the commandments explicitly affirmed there are to be kept; this excludes the ceremonial and civil aspects of the Mosaic law.

=== Eschatology ===

Dispensationalism teaches an eschatology that is explicitly premillennial, in that it affirms the return of Christ prior to a literal 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ on earth as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies. This millennial kingdom will be theocratic in nature, and not mainly soteriological in the way George Eldon Ladd and others with a non-dispensational form of premillennialism have viewed it. It will be distinctly Jewish, with the throne of David restored.

The majority of dispensationalists profess a pretribulation rapture. Midtribulation and posttribulation rapture are minority views. Pretribulational rapture doctrine is what separates dispensationalism from other forms of premillennialism and other millennial views.

Dispensational eschatology was popularized in Hal Lindsey&#x27;s book, &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; (1970). In Lindsey&#x27;s version, the unfolding of events includes the establishment of modern Israel in 1948, Jews regaining control of Jerusalem&#x27;s sacred sites in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, a rebuilding of the Temple which has yet to occur, an Antichrist who will come to power, Christians to be removed from the earth in a rapture of the Church, and seven years of tribulation (Daniel&#x27;s seventieth week) culminating in a great battle of Armageddon in which Christ will triumph over evil and establish a literal 1,000 year reign of his kingdom on earth. Israel and the Church being distinct in this view, the rapture must remove the Church before remnant Israel can be gathered.

==History==
=== Proto-dispensationalism ===
Advocates of dispensationalism have sought to find similar views of dispensations in Church history, referencing theologians or groups such as Francisco Ribera, the Taborites, Joachim of Fiore, Denis the Carthusian and others. Joachim&#x27;s theory of three stages of human history has been argued to have anticipated the later dispensationalist view of organizing history into different dispensations. Joachim&#x27;s stages were divided into the &quot;Age of the Father&quot; which was under the Law, the &quot;Age of the Son&quot; which was a period of tribulation, and the &quot;Age of the Spirit&quot; which was a period of bliss on earth.

Fra Dolcino (c. 1250 – 1307) taught Fiore&#x27;s theory of the stages of history, and dispensationalists Mark Hitchcock and Thomas Ice have suggested that Dolcino&#x27;s teaching was of a pretribulational rapture. The relevant teaching was that when Antichrist appears, Dolcino and his followers would be taken away and preserved from Antichrist, and that following the death of Antichrist, Dolcino and his followers would return to Earth to convert those then living to the true faith. However, the source is an anonymous 1316 Latin text titled &quot;The History of Brother Dolcino&quot;, so it is uncertain whether Dolcino actually taught it.

William C. Watson has argued that multiple 17th century Puritan theologians anticipated dispensational views. In his book &quot;Dispensationalism Before Darby&quot; (2015), he argues that Ephraim Huit (1595–1644) and John Birchensa (in his book &quot;The History of Scripture&quot; published in 1660) taught that God has differing plans for Jews and Gentiles. Watson also argues that Nathaniel Holmes (1599–1678) taught a pretribulational rapture.

Christian mystic and philosopher Pierre Poiret (1646–1719) is said by some to have been the first theologian to develop a dispensationalist system, writing a book titled &quot;The Divine Economy.&quot; Poiret taught that history should be organized into multiple dispensations in which God works with humans in different ways, including the millennium as a future dispensation. Poiret&#x27;s eschatology includes a belief in two resurrections, the rise of the Antichrist, and the nation of Israel being regathered, restored and converted. Poiret divided history into seven dispensations: early childhood (ended in the Flood), childhood (ended in Moses&#x27;s ministry), boyhood (ended in Malachi), youth (ended in Christ), manhood (most of the Church era), old age (&quot;human decay&quot;, meaning the last hour of the Church), and the restoration of all things (the Millennium, including a literal earthly reign of Christ with Israel restored).

Isaac Watts (1674–1748) presented a dispensational view in a forty-page essay titled &quot;The Harmony of All the Religions Which God Ever Prescribed to Men and All His Dispensations Towards Them&quot;. Charles Ryrie states that Scofield&#x27;s outline of dispensationalism, with the exception of the millennium, is exactly that of Watts, and not Darby.

Edward Irving (1792–1834) in some ways anticipated dispensationalism. He used a literal approach to prophetic interpretation, he believed in a restoration of Israel as a nation, and he believed there would be a great apostasy and Christ would return to establish a literal earthly kingdom. But he also preached that Christ had a fallen nature, which led to him being defrocked by the Scots Presbyterians.

=== Formalization by Darby ===

Dispensationalism developed as a system from the teachings of John Nelson Darby (1800–1882), considered by many to be the father of dispensationalism. Darby strongly influenced the Plymouth Brethren of the 1830s in Ireland and England. The original concept came when Darby considered the implications of Isaiah 32 for Israel. He concluded that prophecy required a future fulfillment and realization of Israel&#x27;s kingdom. He saw the New Testament church as a separate program not related to that kingdom. Thus arose a prophetic earthly kingdom program for Israel and a separate &quot;mystery&quot; heavenly program for the church. In order to not conflate the two programs, the prophetic program had to be put on hold to allow for the church to come into existence. Then the church would need to be raptured away before prophecy could resume its earthly program for Israel.

In Darby&#x27;s conception, dispensations relate exclusively to the divine government of the earth. The Mosaic dispensation continues as a divine administration over Earth up until the return of Christ, and the church, being a heavenly designated assembly, is not associated with any dispensations.

Darby&#x27;s Brethren ecclesiology failed to catch on in America, but his eschatological doctrine became widely popular, especially among Baptists and Old School Presbyterians.

===Expansion and growth===
James Inglis (1813–1872) introduced dispensationalism to North America through the monthly magazine &quot;Waymarks in the Wilderness&quot;, published intermittently between 1854 and 1872. In 1866, Inglis organized the Believers&#x27; Meeting for Bible Study, which introduced dispensationalist ideas to a small but influential circle of American evangelicals. They were disturbed by the growth of religious liberalism and saw premillennialism as an answer. Dispensationalism was introduced as a premillennial position, and it took over the evangelical movement in the course of several decades. The American church denominations rejected Darby&#x27;s ecclesiology but accepted his eschatology. Many of these churches were Baptist and Old School Presbyterian; they retained Darby&#x27;s Calvinistic soteriology.

After Inglis&#x27;s death, James H. Brookes (1830–1898), pastor of Walnut Street Presbyterian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, organized the Niagara Bible Conference (1876–1897) to continue dissemination of dispensationalist ideas. Brookes was well known within millenarian circles, both as a prominent speaker at the Believers&#x27; Meeting for Bible Study conferences and for having written articles published in Inglis&#x27;s &quot;Waymarks in the Wilderness&quot;.
Brethren theologian C. H. Mackintosh (1820–1896) had a profound influence on American evangelist Dwight L. Moody (1837–1899), who reached very large audiences with his powerful preaching in the latter half of the 19th century. Moody worked with Brookes and other dispensationalists, and encouraged the spread of dispensationalism. It was during this time that dispensational doctrine became widely accepted among American evangelicals. It also marked a shift in dispensational theology under evangelists like Moody, from Darby&#x27;s Calvinism and doctrinal rigor to a non-Calvinist view of human freedom in personal salvation.

Other prominent dispensationalists in this period include Reuben Archer Torrey (1856–1928), James M. Gray (1851–1925), William J. Erdman (1833–1923), A. C. Dixon (1854–1925), A. J. Gordon (1836–1895), and William Eugene Blackstone (1841–1935). These men were active evangelists who promoted a host of Bible conferences and other missionary and evangelistic efforts. They also gave the dispensationalist philosophy institutional permanence by assuming leadership of new independent Bible institutes, such as the Moody Bible Institute in 1886, the Bible Institute of Los Angeles (now Biola University) in 1908, and Philadelphia College of Bible (now Cairn University, formerly Philadelphia Biblical University) in 1913. The network of related institutes that soon developed became the nucleus for the spread of American dispensationalism. When the Bible Institute of the Chicago Evangelization Society (now Moody Bible Institute) formally opened in 1889, Torrey served as its first superintendent.

Revivalist evangelicals such as Moody and Torrey did not believe the gift of tongues continued past the Apostolic age, but their emphasis on the baptism of the Holy Spirit merged well with holiness ideas. This encouraged the spread of dispensationalism within the Pentecostal movement.

During this time, Anglican clergyman E. W. Bullinger (1837–1913) began teaching what became known as &quot;ultradispensationalism&quot; or &quot;Bullingerism&quot;. Bullinger taught that the Church did not begin until Acts 28, that the Lord&#x27;s Supper and water baptism were for Jewish believers, and that Paul&#x27;s epistles were written to the Jews.

=== Scofield and his influence ===

A disciple of James Brookes, Cyrus Scofield (1843–1921) began attending the Niagara conferences and became an advocate of premillennialism, specifically pre-tribulationism. After several years of work, Scofield introduced dispensationalism to a wider audience in America through his &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot;. Published in 1909 by the Oxford University Press, the &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot; was the first Bible to display overtly dispensationalist notes on the same pages as the biblical text. Use of the Scofield Bible became popular among independent Evangelicals in the United States. Its premillennialism led to a pessimistic social view within evangelicalism, to &quot;not polish the brass rails on the sinking social ship&quot;, so that evangelism came to be focused on saving the lost rather than expanding Christendom.

The &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot; came out at the peak of Bullinger&#x27;s influence. Scofield&#x27;s Bible confronted some of the ultradispensationalists&#x27; (Bullingerites&#x27;) positions, including their divisions of dispensational time. As the Scofield Bible became popular among dispensationalists, it marginalized the hyperdispensationalist position in the United States.

Influenced by Scofield, evangelist and Bible teacher Lewis Sperry Chafer (1871–1952) and his brother Rollin Chafer founded Evangelical Theological College in 1924. The school would eventually become Dallas Theological Seminary, the main dispensationalist institution in America. 

The Baptist Bible Seminary now located in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania became another dispensationalist school.

=== &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; ===
In the 1910s, another publication took hold within American evangelicalism. Known as &quot;The Fundamentals&quot;, its twelve volumes were published in quarterly installments between 1910 and 1915 by the Testimony Publishing Company. Funded by Union Oil co-founder Lyman Stewart (1840–1923) and managed by an executive committee of dispensationalists that included Clarence Dixon and Reuben Torrey, &quot;The Fundamentals&quot; helped solidify dispensationalist views within American Christian fundamentalism and the evangelical movement.

The Scopes trial in 1925 served to unify fundamentalists, but the movement began to decline soon after the trial. Scopes trial prosecutor and public face of the fundamentalist movement William Jennings Bryan died a week after the verdict, and journalist H. L. Mencken portrayed supporters of that anti-evolution verdict as uneducated and ignorant. The fundamentalist movement began to decentralize after it lost Bryan. Dispensationalism&#x27;s fate was tied to that breakdown.

In 1928, Philip Mauro, seeking to re-invigorate the fundamentalist movement, pointed a finger at dispensationalism and in the process coined the term. Singling it out as the source of division within the larger fundamentalist movement, he wrote that the dispensationalist view was more recent than Darwinism and it eroded fundamental truths of scripture.

In 1934, Evangelical Theological College acquired the venerable theological journal (first published in 1844). Lewis Chafer&#x27;s first public declaration that he was a dispensationalist appeared in that journal&#x27;s pages. In 1936, he published a 60-page response to criticism from Mauro and other fundamentalists, entitled &quot;Dispensationalism&quot;. That same year, Chafer renamed his school Dallas Theological Seminary.

The conflict between dispensationalists and covenantalists continued through the 1930s and 1940s, leading to permanent divisions that shaped the fundamentalist movement.

=== Influence of Dallas Theological Seminary ===
By the mid 20th century, evangelicals such as Charles Feinberg, J. Dwight Pentecost, Herman Hoyt, Charles Ryrie, and John Walvoord were promoting dispensationalism. All five of these men either studied or taught at Dallas Theological Seminary (DTS). Pentecost taught there for more than 60 years, and published an influential work on dispensational eschatology, &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1956). A decade later, Ryrie published &quot;Dispensationalism Today&quot; (1965), which has become the primary introduction to dispensational theology.

Furthering the rift with covenant theology, Ryrie wrote in in 1957 that dispensationalism is &quot;the only valid system of Biblical interpretation&quot;. In 1959, Walvoord stated that no non-dispensationalists (including Catholics and mainline Protestants) offered any defense against modernism, and that they were all under the influence of hermeneutical and theological errors.

Dallas Theological Seminary&#x27;s influence grew as other schools and seminaries hired its graduates as faculty. In 1970, DTS graduate Hal Lindsey published &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, which launched dispensationalist eschatology into pop culture. His book sold 10 million copies and made &quot;rapture&quot; and &quot;the tribulation&quot; household words.

=== Pop prophecy ===
The commercial success of &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; triggered a flood of books that featured dispensationalism&#x27;s rapture theology. Lindsey published &quot;Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth&quot; (1972), &quot;There&#x27;s a New World Coming&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Liberation of Planet Earth&quot; (1974)&quot;.&quot; Other books included &quot;The Beginning of the End&quot; (1972) by Tim LaHaye, and DTS graduate Thomas McCall&#x27;s &quot;Satan in the Sanctuary&quot; (1973) and &quot;Raptured&quot; (1975). In 1972, Iowa filmmakers Russell Doughten and Donald W. Thompson released &quot;A Thief in the Night,&quot; a fictional film about the aftermath of the rapture that has been seen by an estimated 300 million people. Televangelist Jack Van Impe covered current events in light of Bible prophecy with a dispensational premillennialist spin.

=== Emergence of the Christian Right ===
The late 20th century marked a shift from the separatism practiced earlier in the century to more political engagement. This era saw emergence of the Christian Right, rooted in the dispensational theology that places Israel at the center of God&#x27;s purpose in the world.

In 1978, dispensationalist television evangelist Jerry Falwell began making trips to Israel that were sponsored by the Israeli government. He became the first major American political figure to insist that the U.S. must support Israel for the fate of the nation. Falwell listed Feinberg, Pentecost, Hoyt, and Walvoord as his most important influences. Jerry Falwell and Tim LaHaye founded the Moral Majority in 1979, with its objective to get people saved, baptized, and registered to vote. The Moral Majority also provided a platform for political activism.

Influenced by dispensational premillennialism, the Moral Majority lobbied for pro-Israel U.S. foreign policy positions, including protection of the Jewish people in Israel and continuing U.S. aid to the state of Israel. Opposed to Jimmy Carter&#x27;s affirmation of a Palestinian homeland, the Moral Majority endorsed Ronald Reagan for President in 1980. In Reagan, they found a candidate who shared their apocalypticism. Reagan had read Hal Lindsey&#x27;s &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, and it has been suggested that this eschatological view drove his Middle East policies. In an interview with televangelist Jim Bakker, Reagan said &quot;[w]e may be the generation that sees Armageddon.&quot; Dispensational theology affected more than the Reagan administration&#x27;s Middle East foreign policy. James G. Watt, a member of the Assemblies of God and Reagan&#x27;s first Secretary of the Interior, told Congress that preservation of the environment was made irrelevant by the imminent return of Christ.

In 1980, Hal Lindsey wrote a follow-up to his book &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;. Lindsey had not previously drawn a connection from a Christian&#x27;s personal obligations to a responsibility for social change, but this changed with his new book, &quot;The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon.&quot; He began encouraging his readers to elect moral leaders who would reflect that morality within government, an agenda closely aligned with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration.

Lifelong fundamentalist and dispensationalist Tim LaHaye also became a prominent figure in the Christian Right. He served as head of the Moral Majority for a time, and in the mid-eighties he created the American Coalition for Traditional Values. In 1987, he served as co-chairman of Republican Jack Kemp&#x27;s presidential campaign, until it was reported that he had called Catholicism &quot;a false religion&quot;.

=== The megachurch movement ===
The growth of suburbs through the 1960s led to the megachurch movement that began in the 1970s. DTS-trained pastors pioneered the movement, including Chuck Swindoll, Erwin Lutzer, David Jeremiah, Robert Jeffress, Tony Evans, and Andy Stanley. Other megachurches, such as John Hagee&#x27;s Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, blended teachings of dispensationalism with the prosperity gospel and New Christian Right activism. Hagee&#x27;s Christians United for Israel included six Pentecostal megachurch pastors and an executive from the Christian Broadcasting Network, including Jerry Falwell. This group became an example of how megachurch dispensationalism was able to find national influence in US politics and diplomacy.

Despite success through growing megachurches, the movement revealed limits when leaders of two of the United States&#x27; largest megachurches, Bill Hybels and Rick Warren, disassociated from the theology of dispensationalism. The revival of reformed theology in the emergence of New Calvinism began in the 1980s. Led by pastors such as John Piper, Tim Keller, Mark Driscoll, Matt Chandler, and Albert Mohler, this spawned a megachurch movement of its own, whose leaders became outspoken critics of dispensationalism.

=== Peak and decline ===
By the 1990s, a younger generation of academics emerged as &quot;progressive dispensationalists&quot;, opening a rift within the united front Ryrie had pushed for in &quot;Dispensationalism Today&quot; (1965). Leaders in this school of thought were Craig A. Blaising, Darrell Bock, Kenneth Barker, and Robert L. Saucy.

Dispensationalism&#x27;s influence within the New Christian Right grew stronger in the 1990s. Building on the success of Hal Lindsey&#x27;s &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, the 1995 novel &quot;Left Behind&quot; pushed pop prophecy to further commercial success. Conceived by Tim LaHaye and written by Jerry B. Jenkins, the book spawned a multimedia franchise of 16 books, plus multiple movies, video games, and other spinoff works. The series brought dispensational premillennialism and its &quot;rapture culture&quot; into plain view.

As with Reagan in the 1980s, the New Christian Right helped elect another &#x27;born again&#x27; president, George W. Bush. Like Reagan, Bush spoke in terms of prophecies being fulfilled in a way that had meaning to dispensationalists. He referred to Gog and Magog in the War on Terror, and said the confrontation was &quot;willed by God, who wants to use this conflict to erase His people&#x27;s enemies&quot;.

Dispensational ideas were experiencing political and commercial success, but Hal Lindsey and Tim LaHaye, who had become the public standard-bearers of dispensationalism, were different from their academic predecessors John Walvoord, Dwight Pentecost, and Charles Ryrie. By the 2010s, support for dispensational theology had peaked in academia and was largely in decline within academic settings. A 2009 survey of Southern Baptist seminaries showed that the majority view was covenantal, and flagship Southern Baptist Theological Seminary had no dispensationalists on its faculty.

Although dispensationalism had collapsed in academic areas, its cultural influence remained. Dispensationalist ideas have persisted in popular culture. A 2004 Newsweek poll indicated that 55 percent of Americans believe Christians will be taken up in the Rapture. By the turn of the 21st century, the term &quot;dispensationalism&quot; had become synonymous with &quot;sectarian fundamentalism&quot;, and had come to be more of a political identity than a theological doctrine. 

Dispensationalism however remains strong within theological circles which espouse Free Grace theology. The majority of those associated with the Free Grace Alliance support dispensationalism and it is taught by the Grace Evangelical Society.

== Criticism ==
The term &quot;dispensationalism&quot; originated with Philip Mauro. His critique of the system is found in his 1928 book &quot;The Gospel of the Kingdom&quot;, in which he wrote that &quot;evangelical Christianity must purge itself of this leaven of dispensationalism&quot;. He used the term to group the new premillennialism, the idea of dispensational time, and the Israel–Church distinction into a single bundled idea.

Protestant denominations and movements that embrace covenant theology tend to reject dispensationalism. For example, Presbyterian minister John Wick Bowman has called the Scofield Bible &quot;the most dangerous heresy currently to be found within Christian circles&quot;. Dispensational theology ultimately led the Presbyterian Church of America (later the Orthodox Presbyterian Church) to split from Bible Presbyterian Synod, which taught dispensationalism. The Churches of Christ became divided in the 1930s as Robert Henry Boll (who taught a variant of dispensationalism) and Foy E. Wallace (representing the amillennial position) disputed severely over eschatology.

=== Soteriology ===
Some dispensational Christian Zionists, such as John Hagee, reject the need for Christians to pursue the conversion of the Jews. Presupposing a difference between law and grace leads to the idea that there are multiple forms of salvation.

In what is known as the Lordship salvation controversy, there are criticisms of a lack of understanding what was necessary to be &quot;born again&quot;. John MacArthur called the problem &quot;easy-believism&quot;, in which the basis of salvation is that one merely needs to claim to follow Jesus. MacArthur identified Dallas Theological Seminary founder Lewis Sperry Chafer as the source of the free grace error. Defense of the dispensational position was led primarily by Charles Ryrie and Zane Hodges.

=== Eschatology ===
The pessimism of premillennial eschatology led dispensationalists to see social reform as wasted effort, so that they focused on converting the lost, with no effort toward the kingdom-building social reform of postmillennialism.

=== Political influence ===
In &quot;American Theocracy&quot; (2006), political commentator Kevin Phillips wrote that dispensationalist and other fundamentalist Christians, together with the oil lobby, provided political support for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. He wrote that most theologians acknowledge there is no specific sequence of end-times events in the Bible, and that such a belief is the result of a century of &quot;amplified Darbyism&quot;. He quoted theologian Barbara Rossing that such hyper-literalism is a &quot;dangerous and false view&quot;.

<text>Dawson College is an English-language public college in Westmount and Montreal, Quebec, Canada.
The college is situated near the heart of Downtown Montreal in a former nunnery on approximately of green space. It is the largest CEGEP in the province of Quebec, with a student population of approximately 8,000 day students and 3,000 evening students enrolled in more than 30 fields of study.

==History==
In September 1945, McGill University established a satellite campus called Sir William Dawson College at the Royal Canadian Air Force base in St. Johns (now Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu), Quebec. This first incarnation of the college was set up to handle the overflow registration of servicemen after the Second World War. Populated mainly by engineering and science students who were required to live onsite, the college operated for five years. It was named after Sir William Dawson, a principal of McGill University from 1855 to 1893.

After the General Vocational College Act came into effect in June 1967, Dawson College became the first English-language institution in the new CEGEP network. It opened its doors in September 1969 to 1,655 students. The college was originally housed in a converted pharmaceutical factory at 350 Selby Street in Westmount. In 1970, a second campus, used mostly for Creative Arts programs, was opened on Viger Street just to the north of Old Montreal. During the next few years, additional spaces were rented across the city such as 4333 Ste. Catherine St. W. (Data Processing, Continuing Education), the Show Mart at Berri (gym), Dome Theatre on Notre Dame St., the Richelieu Building at 990 du Couvent and the La Fontaine building on Sherbrooke Street East. Finally, in 1975, the Victoria Campus was added at 485 McGill St.

In August 1982, the college signed an agreement to acquire the Mother House of the Sisters of the Congrégation de Notre-Dame in order to unify its fourteen separate locations. The campus opened in 1988, and consolidation happened in 1997 when the Selby Campus was closed.

In August 2010, because of an increase in CEGEP enrollments, the college was faced again with a lack of space. The fourth floor of the Pepsi Forum on Atwater Street was leased, allowing for the addition of new classrooms. The P Wing is equipped with six classrooms for regular day DEC students and one classroom and a computer laboratory for AEC students. A security office and student lounge were also added. In 2011, an additional 4 rooms were added to the 4th floor for general study. In 2018, Dawson leased additional space on the Forum 2nd floor, adding general classrooms, active learning rooms and 4 labs for the college Physiotherapy Technology Program.

In 2020, the college was awarded the gold rating for leadership in sustainability by The Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS). The college&#x27;s initiatives include, among other things, a pledge to carbon neutrality, rooftop gardens, certificate programs in Sustainable Happiness, and a student-led initiative to compost waste.

==Programs==
The CEGEP offers two types of programs: pre-university and career/technical. Pre-university programs take two years to complete and cover subject matter that roughly corresponds to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada, as well as university-level introductory courses that prepare students for their chosen field in university. Technical programs take three years to complete and allow graduates to enter the workforce or to pursue their studies at a university level.

Evening courses are offered through continuing education in both credit and non-credit divisions. Corporate training is available as well.

==Dawson Student Union==

The Dawson Student Union (DSU) is the Dawson College students&#x27; union representing the approximately 7,500 full-time students and 2,500 part-time students. It funds, coordinates and regulates clubs and activities and is a resource for students to direct them to appropriate departments and services. The union also does its part to inform students of their rights and lobbies for them when necessary.

In November 2008, the Dawson Student Union contacted Montreal police after an estimated $840,000 in union funds were misappropriated. This came after much criticism towards the union for not publishing financial statements since its 2005 accreditation.

The DSU has since been a functional, autonomous, accredited student union since 2005.

==Campus activities==
Dawson College has a number of clubs, 825 officially funded by the DSU and eight that receive no funding. These include religious and language-themed clubs, para-academic groups, athletic clubs, program-based clubs, Pokémon club, cultural clubs and more. Dawson also has a radio station, CIXS: The Edge, as well as a student newspaper, &quot;The Plant&quot;, which publishes every month during term, with a circulation, in 2012, of about 1,350 copies. Founded in 1969, it is a member of Canadian University Press (CUP), and is the largest CEGEP newspaper in Quebec. Editors are chosen at the end of each semester (August–December, January–May) for the upcoming semester based on a democratic vote by the previous editors and the &#x27;Writing for &quot;The Plant&quot;&#x27; class. There is another paper published annually at Dawson College, the &quot;Dawson Research Journal of Experimental Science&quot; (colloquially known as DrJes). This journal is completely student-run and student submitted. The articles are published after being edited by a board of student editors and then undergo evaluation by referees who are experts in the field. Volume 1 of DrJes was issued in 1999 and at that time was the first journal of its kind in North America.

Most clubs can be found in the 2C wing of the college, which is in the center of the building at street-level. The athletics department is located in the 1H wing, which is at metro-level, in the south-west corner of the school. New clubs can be formed with the help of the DSU.

==Campus athletics==
Dawson College, known nationally as the &quot;Blues,&quot; has one of the largest intercollegiate programs in Canada. A large number of recreational and intramural programs are offered to the student population. Although the college offers a wide variety of sports to its student body, the national governing body of college athletics, the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association (CCAA), only sanctions five sports nationally (AAA). These are: basketball, soccer, golf, badminton and cross-country running. Of these five sports, Dawson College competes nationally in all but badminton.

Dawson has an Athletic therapy clinic.

Some of Dawson&#x27;s highlights from its athletic history include winning the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Provincial Hockey Championships and having the CCAA award the Dawson College Blues a banner representing &quot;25 Years of Basketball Supremacy&quot;.

==School shooting==
On September 13, 2006, a mass shooting occurred at Dawson College. Kimveer Gill, a 25-year-old resident of Laval, Quebec, approached the school and began firing at students outside of the entrance. He proceeded to shoot inside the school before committing suicide after being shot by a police officer. Eighteen-year-old student Anastasia Rebecca de Sousa died at the scene. Nineteen other people were injured, eight critically.

The college was closed until September 15, when teachers and support staff returned. Students were given access to the campus on September 18, and classes resumed the following day, on September 19.

After the shooting, Dawson College provided grief counselling to its students and staff and a research team conducted a three-year study on the psychological impact of the shooting.

=== Peace Garden ===
On September 13, 2011, the ecological Peace Garden on the campus grounds was inaugurated to become a “living memorial” for de Sousa. A CTV News report framed the garden project and the accompanying &quot;Living Campus&quot; program as a demonstration of the college community&#x27;s healing and resilience. The 20,000 square-foot garden was designated an urban biodiversity site in 2014 by &quot;Espace pour la vie Montréal&quot;.

==Controversies==
During the 2012–2013 academic school year, student Ahmed Al-Khabaz was working on an app to give students access to their online records from mobile devices. While developing the application, he and another student discovered a security hole in a third-party student records system.

Al-Khabaz and his colleague reported the issue to the college administration and were congratulated. They were told the problem would be fixed immediately. However, days later, when Al-Khabaz ran a web vulnerability scanner on the college&#x27;s servers to see whether the problem had been resolved, Skytech company president Edward Taza called Al-Khabaz and accused him of performing a cyber attack. Taza spoke of the possibility of legal action and imprisonment and suggested Al-Khabaz sign an agreement to tell no one about the flaw, which Al-Khabaz did. After signing the non-disclosure agreement, the college expelled Al-Khabaz and his appeal to tell his side of the story was denied.

At first, the college refused to comment on the expulsion, stating that they could not discuss individual student situations. However, due to overwhelming public pressure, they said at a press conference that the student had been warned not to attempt to test the security of the system.

<text>Statistics Canada (StatCan; ), formed in 1971, is the agency of the Government of Canada commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. It is headquartered in Ottawa.

The agency is led by the Chief Statistician of Canada, currently André Loranger, who assumed the role on an interim basis on April 1, 2024. StatCan is accountable to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, currently François-Philippe Champagne.

Statistics Canada acts as the national statistical agency for Canada, and Statistics Canada produces statistics for all the provinces as well as the federal government. In addition to conducting about 350 active surveys on virtually all aspects of Canadian life, the &quot;Statistics Act&quot; mandates that Statistics Canada has a duty to conduct a country-wide census of population every five years and a census of agriculture every ten years.

It has regularly been considered the best statistical organization in the world by &quot;The Economist&quot;, such as in the 1991 and 1993 &quot;Good Statistics&quot; surveys. The Public Policy Forum and others have also recognized successes of the agency.

==Leadership==
The head of Statistics Canada is the chief statistician of Canada. The heads of Statistics Canada and the previous organization, the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, are:

* Robert H. Coats (1918–1942)
* Sedley A. Cudmore (1942–1945)
* Herbert Marshall (1945–1956)
* Walter E. Duffett (1957–1972)
* Sylvia Ostry (1972–1975)
* Peter G. Kirkham (1975–1980)
* James L. Fry (1980)
* Martin B. Wilk (1980–1985)
* Ivan P. Fellegi (1985–2008)
* Munir Sheikh (2008–2010)
* Wayne Smith (interim 2010; 2011–2016)
* Anil Arora (2016–2024)
* André Loranger (interim 2024–)

==Publications==
Statistics Canada publishes numerous documents covering a range of statistical information about Canada, including census data, economic and health indicators, immigration economics, income distribution, and social and justice conditions. It also publishes a peer-reviewed statistics journal, &quot;Survey Methodology&quot;.

Statistics Canada provides free access to numerous aggregate data tables on various subjects of relevance to Canadian life. Many tables used to be published as the Canadian Socio-economic Information Management System, or CANSIM, which has since been replaced by new, more easily manipulated data tables.

&quot;The Daily&quot; is Statistics Canada&#x27;s free online bulletin that provides current information from StatCan, updated daily, on current social and economic conditions.

Statistics Canada also provides the Canadian Income Survey (CIS)—a cross-sectional survey that assesses the income, income sources, and the economic status of individuals and families in Canada. Data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is combined with data from the CIS. The February 24, 2020 reported statistics on the poverty based on the market basket measure (MBM).

==Data accessibility and licensing==

 &quot;information published by Statistics Canada is automatically covered by the Open License with the exception of Statistics Canada&#x27;s postal products and Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs).&quot; Researchers using StatCan data are required to &quot;give full credit for any Statistics Canada data, analysis and other content material used or referred to in their studies, articles, papers and other research works.&quot; The use of Public Use Microdata Files (PUMFs) is governed by the Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) License signed by the universities and Statistics Canada. Aggregate data available through the Canadian Socio-economic Information Management System CANSIM, and the census website is Open Data under the Statistics Canada Open License Agreement.

By 24 April 2006, electronic publications on Statistics Canada&#x27;s web site were free of charge with some exceptions.

The historical time series data from CANSIM is also available via numerous third-party data vendors, including Haver Analytics, Macrobond Financial, and Thomson Reuters Datastream.

== Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) ==

The Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) is a network of quantitative social sciences which includes 27 facilities across Canada that provide &quot;access to a vast array of social, economic, and health data, primarily gathered&quot; by Statistics Canada and disseminate &quot;research findings to the policy community and the Canadian public.&quot;

==History==
Statistics Canada was formed by the Statistics Act, which came into force on May 1, 1971. It replaced the Dominion Bureau of Statistics, which was formed in 1918. Statistics Canada published a print copy of the yearly almanac entitled &quot;Canada Year Book&quot; from 1967 to 2012 when it ceased publication due to ebbing demand and deep budgetary cutbacks to StatCan by the federal government. It was a yearly compendium of statistical lore and information on the nation&#x27;s social and economic past, people, events and facts. The &quot;Canada Year Book&quot; was originally edited by a volunteer from the Department of Finance and published by a private company, which offset costs with advertisement sales. This method continued until 1879, at which time the record ceases, until 1885, at which time the Department of Agriculture took up the burden. The duty of publication was transferred to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics upon its formation in 1918.

On June 18, 2005, after years of study by expert panels, discussion, debate (privacy vs the interests of genealogists and historians), Bill S-18 &quot;An Act to Amend the Statistics Act&quot; was passed which released personal census records for censuses taken between 1911 and 2001, inclusive. Debate over the census and their contents had periodically created changes in the Statistics Act such as a 2005 amendment making the privacy restrictions of the census information expire after more than a century. In addition, with Bill S-18, starting with the 2006 census, Canadians can consent to the public release of their personal census information after 92 years. Census returns are in the custody of Statistics Canada and the records are closed until 92 years after the taking of a census, when those records may be opened for public use and transferred to Library and Archives Canada subject to individual consent where applicable.

The mandatory long census form was cancelled by the federal government in 2010 in favour of a voluntary household survey (NHS). The mandatory long form census was reinstated in time for the 2016 census of population.

In 2011, Statistics Canada released an audit acknowledging that from 2004 to 2011, their automated computer processes had &quot;inadvertently made economic data available to data distributors before the official publication time.&quot; In November 2011, in response to the audit, StatCan stopped that process.

===2012 layoffs===
Nearly half of Statistics Canada&#x27;s 5000 employees were notified in April 2012 that their jobs might be eliminated as part of austerity measures imposed by the Conservative federal government in the 2012 Canadian federal budget. The 2,300 employees underwent a process to determine which ones were not impacted, which were eliminated and which were given early retirement or put in new positions. These budget cuts reduced the amount of information Statistics Canada was able to produce during that time period.

==The census==

By law, every household must complete the Canada census form. In May 2006, an Internet version of the census was made widely available for the first time. Another census was held in May 2011, again with the internet being the primary method for statistical data collection. The most recent census was held in May 2021, with the resulting data expected to be published in seven separate data sets throughout 2022. Additional data will be published at a future date which has yet to be determined.

===2011 voluntary long form or National Household Survey===

On June 17, 2010 an Order in Council was created by the minister of industry defining the questions for the 2011 census as including only the short-form questions; this was published in the &quot;Canada Gazette&quot; on June 26, 2010, however a news release was not issued by Minister of Industry Tony Clement until July 13, 2010. This release stated in part &quot;The government will retain the mandatory short form that will collect basic demographic information. To meet the need for additional information, and to respect the privacy wishes of Canadians, the government has introduced the voluntary National Household Survey&quot;. On July 30, 2010 Statistics Canada published a description of the National Household Survey.

The minister of industry, Tony Clement initially indicated that these changes were being made based on consultations with Statistics Canada but was forced to admit that the change from a mandatory to voluntary form was not one of the recommendations received from StatCan after the head of the organization Munir Sheikh resigned in protest. Information has since been uncovered that indicates attempts on the part of the government to distance themselves from the decision, instructing Statistics Canada officials to delete the phrase &quot;as per government decision&quot; from documents which were being written to inform Statistics Canada staff of the change. The minister has since claimed that concerns over privacy and the threat of jail time are the reasons for the change and has refused to reverse his decision stating that the prime minister supports the legislation. The argument over privacy has subsequently been undermined by a privacy commissioner statement that she was &quot;satisfied with the measures Statistics Canada had put into place to protect privacy&quot;. Other industry professionals have also come out in defence of Statistics Canada&#x27;s record on privacy issues. The government has maintained its position, most recently expressed by Lynn Meahan, press secretary to the industry minister, that the new census will result in &quot;useable (sic) and useful data that can meet the needs of many users.&quot;

During the 2010 debates, the Freedom Party of Ontario, a small group based on Ayn Rand&#x27;s writings, whose 42 candidates received 12,381 votes (or 0.26% of the popular vote) in the 2014 election, opposed the long census. They also opposed bilingualism, political correctness and the inclusion of a question on race on the 1996 Canadian census. FPO claimed that Canadian and British traditions had been dishonoured by multiculturalism. They are among a minority who argue that using statistical data to analyse resource allocation is not beneficial.

Central to the debate on this issue is the effect on the quality of data which will be collected by Statistics Canada under the new system. Many groups have made the claim that a voluntary system will not provide a quality of data consistent with what Statistics Canada is known for while others feel that politically motivated changes to StatCan methodology taints the reputation of the whole organization in the international setting. Supporters of the change have offered models of European countries who are adopting alternate systems, although in these states the census is being replaced with a database of information on each citizen rather than a voluntary poll and none of these systems are planned for the Canadian 2011 census. They also challenge the current system&#x27;s ability to cope with rapid socio-demographic changes, though this would not be addressed without increasing the frequency of the survey. Some public opposition to the changes has been expressed through the social media network Facebook.

According to &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, by 2015 an increasing number of economists joined organizations such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Canadian Economics Association, Martin Prosperity Institute, Toronto Region Board of Trade, Restaurants Canada and the Canadian Association of Business Economics to call for a reinstatement of the mandatory long form. Edmonton&#x27;s chief economist preferred the long form and argues that the National Housing Survey is only useful at the aggregate city level and leaves &quot;a dearth of data on long-term changes at the neighbourhood level and within demographic groups... making it difficult to make decisions such as &quot;where to build a library, where to build a fire hall&quot; without specific demographic information. Because it was not mandatory there was a lower response rate and therefore increased risk of under-representation of some vulnerable segments of society, for example aboriginal peoples, newly arrived immigrants. This makes it more difficult to &quot;pinpoint trends such as income inequality, immigrant outcomes in the jobs market, labour shortages and demographic shifts.&quot;

=== 2015 reinstatement of mandatory long form ===
One day after his election in November 2015, the Liberal government of Justin Trudeau reinstated the mandatory census long form and it was used in the 2016 census.

===Political reactions===
Former industry minister Tony Clement recanted on his support for the elimination of the long form. He avowed that there were ways to protect both indispensable data and Canadians&#x27; privacy. Blaming his party for a &quot;collective&quot; decision to terminate the long form, he said, &quot;I think I would have done it differently.&quot; He implied incorrectly that Statistics Canada head Munir Sheikh had agreed with the cancellation when it was done.

<text>The Saale (), also known as the Saxon Saale ( ) and Thuringian Saale (), is a river in Germany and a left-bank tributary of the Elbe. It is not to be confused with the smaller Franconian Saale, a right-bank tributary of the Main, or the Saale in Lower Saxony, a tributary of the Leine.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Saale&quot; comes from the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27;marsh&#x27;, akin to Welsh &quot;hêl, heledd&quot; &#x27;river meadow&#x27;, Cornish &quot;heyl&quot; &#x27;estuary&#x27;, Greek &quot;hélos&quot; &#x27;marsh, meadow&#x27;, Sanskrit &quot;sáras&quot; &#x27;lake, pond&#x27;, &quot;Sárasvati&quot; &#x27;sacred river&#x27;, Old Persian &quot;Harauvati&quot; &#x27;Hārūt River; Arachosia&#x27;, Avestan &quot;Haraxvatī&quot;, idem. It may also be related to the Indo-European root *&quot;sal&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;.

The Slavic name of the Saale, &quot;Solawa&quot;, still found in Sorbian texts, comes from Old High German &quot;sol&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;, and &quot;awa&quot;, &quot;water&quot;.

==Course==

The Saale originates on the slope of the Großer Waldstein mountain near Zell in the Fichtel Mountains in Upper Franconia (Bavaria), at an elevation of . It pursues a winding course in a northern direction, and after passing the manufacturing town of Hof, enters Thuringia. It flows amid well-wooded low mountains of the Thuringian Forest until it reaches the valley of Saalfeld. After leaving Saalfeld the Saale reaches Rudolstadt. Here it receives the waters of the Schwarza, in whose valley lies the ruined castle of Schwarzburg, the ancestral seat of the formerly ruling House of Schwarzburg.

From Saalfeld, the Saale enters the limestone hill region north of the Thuringian Forest, and sweeps beneath the hills enclosing the university town of Jena. It enters Saxony-Anhalt and passes the spa of Bad Kösen and, after receiving the deep and navigable Unstrut at Naumburg, flows past Weißenfels, Merseburg, Halle, Bernburg and Calbe. It finally joins the Elbe just above Barby, after traversing a distance of —shortened by a bypass from its natural length of .

The Saale is navigable from Naumburg and is also planned connected from Leuna with the White Elster near Leipzig by an unfinished canal. The soil of the lower part of its valley is exceptionally fertile, and produces, amongst other crops, large quantities of sugar beet. Among its tributaries are the White Elster, Southern and Northern Regnitz and Orla on the right bank, and the Ilm, Unstrut, Salza, Wipper and Bode on the left. Its upper course is rapid. Its valley, down to Merseburg, contains many castles which crown the enclosing heights.

<doc id="186774" wikidata="Q892492" url="?curid=186774" title="Third-rate">
<text>In the rating system of the Royal Navy, a third rate was a ship of the line which from the 1720s mounted between 64 and 80 guns, typically built with two gun decks (thus the related term two-decker).

== Rating ==

When the rating system was first established in the 1620s, the third rate was defined as those ships having at least 200 but not more than 300 men; previous to this, the type had been classified as &quot;middling ships&quot;. By the 1660s, the means of classification had shifted from the number of men to the number of carriage-mounted guns, and third rates at that time mounted between 48 and 60 guns. By the turn of the century, the criterion boundaries had increased and third rate carried more than 60 guns, with second rates having between 90 and 98 guns, while first rates had 100 guns or more, and fourth rates between 48 and 60 guns. By the latter half of the 18th century, they carried between 500 and 720 men.

This designation became especially common because it included the seventy-four gun ship, which eventually came to be the most popular size of large ship for navies of several different nations. It was an easier ship to handle than a first- or second-rate ship, but still possessed enough firepower to potentially destroy any single opponent other than a three-decker. It was also cheaper to operate.

By the end of the 18th century, ships of the line were usually categorized directly by their number of guns, the numbers even being used as the name of the class, as in &quot;a squadron of three 74s&quot;, but officially the rating system continued until the end of the Age of Sail, only undergoing a modification in 1817.

Note that the use of terms like &quot;third-rate&quot; in literature can lead to confusion: The French Navy had a different system of five rates or &quot;rangs&quot;, but some British authors use the Royal Navy&#x27;s rating of &quot;third rate&quot; when speaking of a French 74.

<text>Taupō (), sometimes written Taupo, is a town located in the central North Island of New Zealand. It is situated on the edge of Lake Taupō, which is the largest freshwater lake in New Zealand. Taupō was constituted as a borough in 1953. It has been the seat of Taupō District Council since the council was formed in 1989.

Taupō is the largest urban area of the Taupō District, and the second-largest urban area in the Waikato region, behind Hamilton. It has a population of approximately Taupō is known for its natural beauty, with the surrounding area offering a range of outdoor recreational activities such as hiking, fishing, skiing, and water sports. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of attractions, including the Wairakei Power Station, Huka Falls, and the Tongariro National Park.

==Naming==
The name &quot;Taupō&quot; is from the Māori language and is a shortened version of &quot;Taupō-nui-a-Tia&quot;. The longer name was first given to the cliff at Pākā Bay, on the eastern shore of the lake, and means the &quot;great cloak of Tia&quot;. It was named for Tia, the Māori explorer who discovered the lake. Māori later applied the name to the lake itself. In 2019 the official name of the town was changed from &quot;Taupo&quot; to &quot;Taupō&quot;.

Although the English pronunciation &quot;tow-po&quot; (, NZE ) is widespread, it is often regarded as incorrect, and the Māori pronunciation, &quot;toe-paw&quot; (, NZE ) is generally preferred in formal use.

== History ==
In 1868, an armed constabulary post was established in Taupō in order to strengthen communication lines in the central North Island. Hot water pools around Taupō began to attract tourists to Taupō in the late 1870s and early 1880s and hotels were developed to take advantage of this. In the 1890s, rainbow trout were introduced to Lake Taupō and Taupō became a popular town to stay and fish. 

A road board was established in 1922 and it was made a borough in 1953. Taupō grew quickly due to the development of the Wairakei geothermal power station, expansion of the timber industry, and farm development between 1949 and 1953. The population of Taupō was 1,358 in 1951, later increasing to 2,849 people in 1956 and 5,251 people in 1961.

<text>Harold Lee Lindsey (November 23, 1929 – November 25, 2024) was an American evangelical writer and television host. He wrote a series of popular apocalyptic books – beginning with &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot; (1970) – asserting that the Apocalypse or end time (including the rapture) was imminent because current events were fulfilling Bible prophecy. He was a Christian Zionist and dispensationalist.

==Biography==
Lindsey was born in Houston on November 23, 1929. He enrolled at the University of Houston and served in the United States Coast Guard during the Korean War. He graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1962 with a Master of Theology degree, majoring in the New Testament and early Greek literature. 

With his second wife, Jan, he worked with Campus Crusade for Christ and continued with them until 1969. He then helped a mission in Southern California which continued until 1976. He was also a frequent speaker and Sunday School teacher at Melodyland Christian Center in Anaheim, California. During 1969, he wrote his first, and best-known book, &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;. Published during 1970 by Zondervan, this book became a bestseller. Coming on the heels of the Six-Day War, the book fueled the popularity of dispensationalism and its support of ethnic Jews as the &quot;chosen people of God&quot;. Many of Lindsey&#x27;s later writings are sequels or revisions and extensions of his first book. In 1994, he earned his Doctorate of Theology from the California Graduate School of Theology.

Lindsey hosted &quot;International Intelligence Briefing&quot; on the Trinity Broadcasting Network and served on the executive board of Christian Voice. &quot;International Intelligence Briefing&quot; was eliminated from broadcasting by TBN for the entire month of December 2005. Lindsey claimed that this was because &quot;some at the network apparently feel that [his] message is too pro-Israel and too anti-Muslim.&quot; TBN owner Paul Crouch, however, contended that &quot;TBN has never been and is not now against Israel and the Jewish people.&quot; Crouch said that Lindsey&#x27;s show was pre-empted for Christmas programming.

Lindsey resigned from TBN on January 1, 2006, and indicated that he would pursue another television ministry. His next program, &quot;The Hal Lindsey Report&quot;, emphasized biblical prophecy and current events, and is broadcast by the Angel One and DayStar networks. During January 2007, Lindsey announced that he would be returning to the TBN network.

Lindsey was married four times and had three children from his second marriage. His second wife was Jan Houghton, and his fourth wife, to whom he was married at the time of his death, was named JoLyn. He lived in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and died at home on November 25, 2024, two days after his 95th birthday.

== Biblical interpretations ==
Lindsey&#x27;s claims were based on a dispensationalist interpretation of the Old and New Testament. Lindsey claimed from the Bible that Jesus Christ will return from heaven to earth someday and establish eternal peace and harmony among all people.

Lindsey claimed the Bible contains numerous prophecies that foretell of certain conditions and events that will occur in the world prior to Christ&#x27;s return and that as these things occur, they are to serve as signs and reminders that we are in the era that the Bible calls the &quot;end times&quot; or &quot;last days&quot;. Lindsey believed a prophetic event that officially begins the &quot;end times&quot; is the regathering of the Jewish people to their ancient homeland to form an independent nation after a prolonged worldwide dispersion. He claimed that the establishment of the State of Israel in May 1948 is the fulfillment of this major prophecy.

In &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, Lindsey wrote that the biblical prophets identified certain nations that would ally with other countries to form &quot;four major spheres of political power&quot; during the same era that Israel would be reestablished as a nation. Lindsey wrote that these nations and their allies can be identified as: (1) Russia with its allies, (2) China with other nations of the Orient, (3) Egypt with other Middle East countries, and (4) an alliance of Western European nations.

According to Lindsey, the alliance of Western European nations is a revived form of the ancient Roman Empire, predicted in the books of Daniel and Revelation symbolically as &quot;ten horns&quot; and &quot;ten kings&quot;. In &quot;The Late Great Planet Earth&quot;, Lindsey quotes from a 1969 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article that the goal of the European Economic Community, which preceded the European Union, was to establish a ten-nation economic community. Lindsey concludes, based on this and other sources, that this alliance will help cause the fulfillment of this prophecy and will ultimately be ruled by the Antichrist.

Lindsey noted that the prophets did not refer to the United States directly or indirectly. He concluded that this is an indication that the U.S. will no longer be a great geo-political power by the time the Tribulation of the end times arrives.

In a later book, titled &quot;The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon&quot;, he indicated that he believed it was possible that the battle of Armageddon could occur in the not too distant future, stating, &quot;the decade of the 1980s could very well be the last decade of history as we know it.&quot; He noted again that there is no reference to the U.S. in Bible prophecy. He listed a few scenarios that seemed plausible to him at the time: (1) A takeover by communists, (2) destruction by a surprise Soviet nuclear attack, or (3) becoming a dependent of the 10-nation European community. The book was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list for 20 weeks.

<text>Hal Linden (born Harold Lipshitz, March 20, 1931) is an American stage and screen actor, television director and musician.

Linden began his career as a big band musician and singer in the 1950s. After a stint in the United States Army, he began an acting career, first working in summer stock and off-Broadway productions. Linden found success on Broadway when he replaced Sydney Chaplin in the musical &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;. In 1962, he starred as Billy Crocker in the off-Broadway revival of the Cole Porter musical &quot;Anything Goes&quot;. In 1971, he won a Best Actor Tony Award for his portrayal of Mayer Rothschild in the musical &quot;The Rothschilds&quot;.

In 1974, Linden landed his best-known role as the title character in the television comedy series &quot;Barney Miller&quot;. The role earned him seven Primetime Emmy nominations and three Golden Globe Award nominations. During the series&#x27; run, Linden also hosted two educational series, &quot;Animals, Animals, Animals&quot; and &quot;FYI&quot;. He won two special Daytime Emmy Awards for the latter series. Linden won a third Daytime Emmy Award for a guest-starring role on &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot; in 1995. Linden has since continued his career on the stage, in films and guest-starring roles on television. He released his first album of pop and jazz standards, &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late&quot;, in 2011.

==Early life==
Hal Linden was born on March 20, 1931, in The Bronx, New York City, New York, the youngest son of Frances (née Rosen) and Charles Lipshitz, a Lithuanian Jew who immigrated to the United States in 1910 and owned a printing shop. Hal&#x27;s older brother, Bernard, became a professor of music at Bowling Green State University. Linden attended Herman Ridder Junior High School and the High School of Music and Art, going on to study music at Queens College, City University of New York. He later enrolled in Baruch College and then City College of New York where he received a Bachelor of Arts in business.

During his youth, Linden wanted to be a big band singer and bandleader. Before embarking on a career in music, he decided to change his name, stating, &quot;&#x27;Swing and Sway with Harold Lipshitz&#x27; just didn&#x27;t parse.&quot; While riding on a bus from Philadelphia to New York through the town of Linden, New Jersey, he saw the name Linden on the water tower and changed his name to Hal Linden. During the 1950s, he toured with Sammy Kaye, Bobby Sherwood, and other big bands of the era. Linden played the saxophone and clarinet and also sang.

He enlisted in the United States Army in 1952 and was sent to Fort Belvoir and played in the United States Army Band. While he was in Fort Belvoir, a friend recommended that he see the touring production of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; playing in Washington, D.C. After seeing the show, Linden decided to become an actor. He was discharged from the Army in 1954.

==Career==
Linden replaced Sydney Chaplin in the Broadway production of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; in 1958. He made a further breakthrough on the New York City stage in 1962 when he was cast as Billy Crocker in the revival of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Anything Goes&quot;.

Linden&#x27;s career slowed in the 1960s. During this time, he dubbed English dialogue for various foreign films, did voiceover work for commercials and sang jingles, and performed in industrial musicals such as &quot;Diesel Dazzle&quot; (1966). His career was revived in the 1970s when he was cast as Mayer Rothschild in the 1971 musical &quot;The Rothschilds&quot;. The role earned him a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. In 1973, he co-starred opposite Tony Lo Bianco in the NBC television film &quot;Mr. Inside/Mr. Outside&quot;. The film was intended to be the pilot for a proposed series but was not picked up by the network.

===&quot;Barney Miller&quot;===
In 1974, Linden landed the starring role in the ABC television police sitcom &quot;Barney Miller&quot;. He portrayed the eponymous captain of the 12th Precinct in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, New York City. He earned seven Emmy Award nominations for his work on the series. Linden is tied with Matt LeBlanc and John Goodman for the most Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series Emmy Award nominations without ever winning. He also earned four Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy. The series aired from 1975 to 1982. Linden later said that leaving Broadway to work on &quot;Barney Miller&quot; was his most irrational act and also one of his best decisions.

During the run of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, Linden served as the narrator and host of the ABC children&#x27;s shows &quot;Animals, Animals, Animals&quot; and &quot;FYI&quot;. He won two Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Individual Achievement for his host work on &quot;FYI&quot;. in 1984 and 1985.

===Later career===
After &quot;Barney Miller&quot; ended in 1982, Linden appeared in several television films, including &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; (1982), the television adaptation of the musical of the same name, and &quot;&quot; (1983). Also in 1982, he was the producers&#x27; first choice for the starring role of Dr. Donald Westphall in &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, but he turned down the opportunity without reading the script or meeting the producers because he wanted to take a break from television. (The role was then given to Ed Flanders.)

In 1984, he costarred in the television film &quot;Second Edition&quot;. The film was intended to be a series but was not picked up by CBS. The following year, Linden portrayed studio head Jack L. Warner in the television biopic &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn&quot;.
In 1986, Linden returned to episodic television in the NBC series &quot;Blacke&#x27;s Magic&quot;. He played the lead character, Alexander Blacke, a magician who solves mysteries with the help of his father Leonard (Harry Morgan), a retired carnival magician and sometimes confidence man. The series was canceled after 13 episodes. In 1988, he co-starred in the romantic comedy &quot;A New Life&quot;, directed by Alan Alda. In 1991 he guest-starred in an episode of “The Golden Girls” in the part of John Neretti, Bea Arthur’s character’s love interest. In 1992, Linden tried his hand at television again with the leading role in the comedy-drama series &quot;Jack&#x27;s Place&quot;. In the series, Linden portrayed Jack Evans, a retired jazz musician who ran a restaurant that was frequented by patrons who learned lessons about love. The show was often compared to &quot;The Love Boat&quot; by critics as it featured a different weekly guest star. The series premiered as a mid-season replacement but did well enough in the ratings for ABC to order additional episodes. Viewership soon declined and ABC chose to cancel the series in 1993. The next year, Linden appeared in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Boys Are Back&quot;. That series was also low rated and canceled after 18 episodes. In 1995, Linden won his third Daytime Emmy Award for his 1994 guest-starring role as Rabbi Markovitz on &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot;.

In 1996, Linden had a supporting role in the television film &quot;The Colony&quot;, opposite John Ritter and June Lockhart. The role was a departure for Linden as he played the villainous head of a home owner&#x27;s association of a gated community. In 1999, he had a guest role in the last &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; reunion TV film, &quot;The Rockford Files: If It Bleeds... It Leads&quot;. In 1997, he played Ebeneezer Scrooge in the yearly Madison Square Garden production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. He continued his career in the late 1990s and 2000s with guest roles on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, and &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot;. He also narrated episodes of &quot;Biography&quot; and &quot;The American Experience&quot;, and voiced Dr. Selig on the animated series &quot;The Zeta Project&quot;. In 2002, Linden received a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars.

In 2008, he played Arvide Abernathy in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; at Hilbert Circle Theatre. Linden continued to have an active stage career. He appeared in the Toronto production of &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; in 2009. In July 2011, he appeared opposite Christina Pickles in the Colony Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;. In 2011, Linden starred in a touring production of Shine featuring local professional talent. Linden also starred in &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, which premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse on September 19, 2012, and ran through October 2012. In 2013, Linden guest-starred in a season eight episode of &quot;Supernatural&quot; as a rabbi. In 2014, Linden guest-starred in an episode of the comedy series &quot;2 Broke Girls&quot;. In 2015, he appeared at the Old Globe Theatre in the West Coast premiere of &quot;The Twenty Seventh Man&quot; starring as Yevgeny Zunser.

===Music===
After the success of &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, Linden decided to revive his music career with a nightclub act. In his act, Linden played the clarinet, performed pop and Broadway standards backed by a big band, and discussed his life and career. In March 2011, he began touring with the cabaret show &quot;An Evening with Hal Linden: I&#x27;m Old Fashioned&quot;. The show, which ran through 2012, was later released on DVD. In April 2011, Linden released his first album, &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late&quot;. The album features a collection of jazz, Broadway and pop standards that Linden began recording around the time he was touring in the early 1980s. Due to a lack of interest, he shelved the songs. Linden decided to finish the album on the advice of his tour booker.

==Personal life==
Linden is the spokesman for the Jewish National Fund, a position he has held since 1997.

Linden met dancer Fran Martin while doing summer stock in 1955. They married in 1958 and had four children. Martin died in 2010.

In 1984, Linden narrated a short film on former President Harry S. Truman, which was shown during that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention.

<text>The white-rumped vulture (Gyps bengalensis) is an Old World vulture native to South and Southeast Asia. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2000, as the population severely declined. White-rumped vultures die of kidney failure caused by diclofenac poisoning.
In the 1980s, the global population was estimated at several million individuals, and it was thought to be &quot;the most abundant large bird of prey in the world&quot;. As of 2021, the global population was estimated at less than 6,000 mature individuals.

It is closely related to the European griffon vulture (&quot;Gyps fulvus&quot;). At one time it was believed to be closer to the white-backed vulture of Africa and was known as the Oriental white-backed vulture.

==Taxonomy==
The white-rumped vulture was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the vultures in the genus &quot;Vultur&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Vultur bengalensis&quot;.
Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Bengal vulture&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had seen a live bird at the Tower of London and had been told by the keeper that it had come from Bengal. The white-rumped vulture is now one of eight species placed in the genus &quot;Gyps&quot; that was introduced in 1809 by the French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;gups&quot; meaning &quot;vultur&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

== Description ==
The white-rumped vulture is a typical, medium-sized vulture, with an unfeathered head and neck, very broad wings, and short tail feathers. It is much smaller than the Eurasian Griffon. It has a white neck ruff. The adult&#x27;s whitish back, rump, and underwing coverts contrast with the otherwise dark plumage. The body is black and the secondaries are silvery grey. The head is tinged in pink and bill is silvery with dark ceres. The nostril openings are slit-like. Juveniles are largely dark and take about four or five years to acquire the adult plumage. In flight, the adults show a dark leading edge of the wing and has a white wing-lining on the underside. The undertail coverts are black.

It is the smallest of the &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures, but is still a very large bird. It weighs , measures in length, and has a wingspan of .

This vulture builds its nest on tall trees often near human habitations in northern and central India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and southeast Asia, laying one egg. Birds form roost colonies. The population is mostly resident.

Like other vultures it is a scavenger, feeding mostly on carcasses, which it finds by soaring high in thermals and spotting other scavengers. A 19th century experimenter who hid a carcass of dog in a sack in a tree considered it capable of finding carrion by smell. It often flies and sits in flocks. At one time, it was the most numerous vulture in India.

Within the well-supported clade of the genus &quot;Gyps&quot; which includes Asian, African, and European populations, it has been determined that this species is basal with the other species being more recent in their species divergence.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

White-rumped vultures usually become active when the morning sun is warming up the air so that thermals are sufficient to support their soaring. They were once visible above Calcutta in large numbers.

When they find a carcass, they quickly descend and feed voraciously. They perch on trees nearby and are known to sometimes descend also after dark to feed. At kill sites, they are dominated by red-headed vultures &quot;Sarcogyps calvus&quot;.
In forests, their soaring often indicated a tiger kill. They swallow pieces of old, dry bones such as ribs and of skull pieces from small mammals.
Where water is available they bathe regularly and also drink water. A pack of vultures was observed to have cleaned up a whole bullock in about 20 minutes. Trees on which they regularly roost are often white from their excreta, and this acidity often kills the trees. This made them less welcome in orchards and plantations.

They sometimes feed on dead vultures. One white-rumped vulture was observed when getting caught in the mouth of a dying calf.
Jungle crows have been sighted to steal food brought by adults and regurgitated to young.

Allan Octavian Hume observed &quot;hundreds of nests&quot; and noted that white-rumped vultures used to nest on large trees near habitations even when there were convenient cliffs in the vicinity. The preferred nesting trees were Banyan, Peepul, Arjun, and Neem. The main nesting period was November to March with eggs being laid mainly in January. Several pairs nest in the vicinity of each other and isolated nests tend to be those of younger birds. Nests are lined with green leaves.
In Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, white-rumped vultures used foremost &quot;Terminalia arjuna&quot; and &quot;Spondias mangifera&quot; trees for nesting at a mean height of . Their nests were long, wide and deep. Hatchlings were seen from the first to the second week of January.

Solitary nests are not used regularly and are sometimes taken over by the red-headed vulture and large owls such as &quot;Bubo coromandus&quot;. The male initially brings twigs and arranges them to form the nest. During courtship the male bills the female&#x27;s head, back and neck. The female invites copulation, and the male mounts and hold the head of the female in his bill. Usually, the female lays a single egg, which is white with a tinge of bluish-green. Female birds destroy the nest on loss of an egg. They are usually silent but make hissing and roaring sounds at the nest or when jostling for food. The eggs hatch after about 30 to 35 days of incubation. The young chick is covered with grey down. The parents feed them with bits of meat from a carcass. The young birds remain for about three months in the nest.

Mycoplasmas have been isolated from tissues of a white-rumped vulture. Mallophagan parasites such as &quot;Falcolipeurus&quot; and &quot;Colpocephalum turbinatum&quot;have been collected from the species.
Ticks, &quot;Argas (Persicargas) abdussalami&quot;, have been collected in numbers from the roost trees of these vultures in Pakistan.

A captive individual lived for at least 12 years.

==Status and decline==
===In the Indian subcontinent===

The white-rumped vulture was originally very common especially in the Gangetic plains of India, and often seen nesting on the avenue trees within large cities in the region. Hugh Whistler noted for instance in his guide to the birds of India that it “is the commonest of all the vultures of India, and must be familiar to those who have visited the Towers of Silence in Bombay.” T. C. Jerdon noted that “[T]his is the most common vulture of India, and is found in immense numbers all over the country, ... At Calcutta one may frequently be seen seated on the bloated corpse of some Hindoo floating up or down with the tide, its wing spread, to assist in steadying it...”

Before the 1990s they were even seen as a nuisance, particularly to aircraft as they were often involved in bird strikes. In 1941 Charles McCann wrote about the death of &quot;Borassus&quot; palms due to the effect of excreta from vultures roosting on them. In 1990, the species had already become rare in Andhra Pradesh in the districts of Guntur and Prakasham. The hunting of the birds for meat by the Bandola (Banda) people there was attributed as a reason. A cyclone in the region during 1990 resulted in numerous livestock deaths and no vultures were found at the carcasses.

This species, as well as the Indian vulture and slender-billed vulture has suffered a 99% population decrease in India and nearby countries since the early 1990s. The decline has been widely attributed to poisoning by diclofenac, which is used as veterinary non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), leaving traces in cattle carcasses which when fed on leads to kidney failure in birds. Diclofenac was also found to be lethal at low dosages to other species in the genus &quot;Gyps&quot;. Other NSAIDs were also found to be toxic, to &quot;Gyps&quot; as well as other birds such as storks. It was shown between 2000-2007 annual decline rates in India averaged 43.9% and ranged from 11-61% in Punjab. Organochlorine pesticide residues were found from egg and tissue samples from around India varying in concentrations from 0.002 μg/g of DDE in muscles of vulture from Mudumalai to 7.30 μg/g in liver samples from vultures of Delhi. Dieldrin varied from 0.003 and 0.015 μg/g. Higher concentrations were found in Lucknow. These pesticide levels have not however been implicated in the decline.

An alternate hypothesis is an epidemic of avian malaria, as implicated in the extinctions of birds in the Hawaiian islands. Evidence for the idea is drawn from an apparent recovery of a vulture following chloroquine treatment. Yet another suggestion has been that the population changes may be linked with long term climatic cycles such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.

Affected vultures were initially reported to adopt a drooped neck posture and this was considered a symptom of pesticide poisoning, but subsequent studies suggested that this may be a thermoregulatory response as the posture was seen mainly during hot weather.

It has been suggested that rabies cases have increased in India due to the decline.

=== In Southeast Asia ===
In Southeast Asia, the near-total disappearance of white-rumped vultures predated the present diclofenac crisis, and probably resulted from the collapse of large wild ungulate populations and improved management of dead livestock, resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures.

== Conservation ==

Currently, only the Cambodia and Burma populations are thought to be viable though those populations are still very small (low hundreds). It has been suggested that the use of meloxicam (another NSAID) as a veterinary substitute that is safer for vultures would help in the recovery. Campaigns to ban the use of diclofenac in veterinary practice have been underway in several South Asian countries.

Conservation measures have included reintroduction, captive-breeding programs and artificial feeding or &quot;vulture restaurants&quot;. Two chicks, which were apparently the first captive-bred white-rumped vultures ever, hatched in January 2007, at a facility at Pinjore. However, they died after a few weeks, apparently because their parents were an inexperienced couple breeding for the first time in their lives – a fairly common occurrence in birds of prey.

<text>Richard Deacon (born 15 August 1949) is a British abstract sculptor, and a winner of the Turner Prize.

==Early life and education==
Deacon was born in Bangor, Wales and educated at Plymouth College. He then studied at the Somerset College of Art, Taunton, at Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art, London, and at the Royal College of Art, also in London. He left the Royal College in 1977, and went on to study part-time at the Chelsea School of Art. Deacon&#x27;s first one-person show came in 1978 in Brixton.

==Work==
Deacon&#x27;s work is abstract, but often alludes to anatomical functions. His works are often constructed from everyday materials such as laminated plywood, and he calls himself a &quot;fabricator&quot; rather than a &quot;sculptor&quot;. His early pieces are typically made up of sleek curved forms, with later works sometimes more bulky. Deacon&#x27;s body of work includes small-scale works suitable for showing in art galleries, as well as much larger pieces shown in sculpture gardens and objects made for specific events, such as dance performances. Deacon was part of the jury that awarded the Käthe Kollwitz Prize of the Berlin Academy of Arts to Maria Eichhorn in 2021.

==Recognition==
Deacon won the Turner Prize in 1987 (nominated for his touring show &quot;For Those Who Have Eyes&quot;) having previously been nominated in 1984. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1998.

Deacon was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 New Year Honours List. In 2007, he represented Wales at the Venice Biennale. He was one of the five artists shortlisted for the Angel of the South project in January 2008.

In 2017, Deacon won the &quot;Ernst Franz Vogelmann-Preis für Skulptur&quot;, Heilbronn. Also in 2017, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Arts University Plymouth (formerly Plymouth College of Art).

<text>The Indian vulture or long-billed vulture (Gyps indicus) is a bird of prey native to the Indian subcontinent. It is an Old World vulture belonging to the family of Accipitridae. It is a medium-sized vulture with a small, semi-bald head with little feathers, long beak, and wide dark colored wings. It breeds mainly on small cliffs and hilly crags in central India and south India.

The Indian vulture is a keystone species that has been listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2002, as the population has severely declined during the Indian vulture crisis. It is estimated that there are 5,000-15,000 mature individuals in the wild. The main cause of the decline was identified as kidney failure caused by the drug diclofenac, which was commonly given to cattle to reduce joint pain. It is thought that diclofenac poisoned vultures that ate the flesh of dead cattle. Diclofenac bans were enacted in India, Pakistan and Nepal in 2006.

The bird shares its habitat with two other vulture species (namely, the slender-billed vulture (&quot;Gyps tenuirostris&quot;) and white-rumped vulture (&quot;Gyps bengalensis&quot;)) in some parts of its range.

==Taxonomy==
The Indian vulture is placed in the genus Gyps (old world vultures), and gets both its common and specific scientific names from its nativity to the Indian subcontinent. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;gups&quot; meaning &quot;vulture&quot; and the species name is Neo-Latin &quot;indicus&quot; from the Ancient Greek &quot;indikós&quot; meaning &quot;Indian&quot;.

The slender-billed vulture (&quot;Gyps tenuirostris&quot;) was a sub-species of Indian vulture until 2001. Based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA evidence, it was separated into a different species from the Indian vulture in 2001.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the Indian vulture extended from southeastern Pakistan to south India and to Indochina and the northern Malay Peninsula in the east. It is now extinct in South East Asia with current populations existing mostly in central and peninsular India, south of the Gangetic plains. It is also found in southwest Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.

It is also found in various land-forms ranging from semi-desert to dry foot hills, open fields and cultivable lands near villages, near garbage dumps and slaughter houses in urban areas. They are not migratory but travel hundreds of miles in a day scavenging for food. Indian vultures nest on cliffs or high buildings and rarely on trees.

==Description==
The Indian vulture is bulky and medium in size. Its body and covert feathers are pale brown with darker flight feathers. It has white thighs with scattered white fluff and broad wings with short tail feathers. It has a small, bare, dark-brown head with a long featherless neck, dark eyes and a long yellowish beak with a pale green-yellow cere. It is long and has a wing span of . 

The bald heads allow them to maintain body temperature in response to the environment. When it is cold, they tuck their necks in closer to their bodies to keep them warm and when it is hot, they extend their necks. Indian vultures have very few feathers on their heads which help them to keep their heads clean when they stick them into the rotting carcasses to feed. 

It weighs and is comparatively smaller than the Eurasian griffon. It is distinguished from that species by its less bulky body and wing coverts.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The Indian vulture is a powerful flier and soars on thermal convection currents. It reaches speeds of 35 km/h (22 mph) when gliding and can fly for six to seven hours continuously. The Indian vulture nests mainly on cliffs and is usually found is small flocks, sometimes with other vulture species.

=== Diet and feeding ===

The Indian vulture is a keystone species in its habitats and is a scavenging bird, feeding mostly from carcasses of dead animals. It plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by removing rotting meat that would otherwise spread disease. It covers wide areas sometimes ranging hundreds of miles in search of carcasses and mainly uses its eye sight to spot the same. 

They are often attracted to large gatherings of other raptors or scavengers as this usually means that there is a carrion nearby. The Indian vultures generally feed on dead cattle and any leftovers by large predators. Individual birds often fight with each other to maintain the best position at the carcass. As Indian long-billed vultures are comparatively smaller than some other species, they have to sometimes back down to let other larger birds.

=== Lifespan and mortality ===
Indian vultures have a lifespan of 40 to 45 years. They sexually mature at five years of age. While vultures in the wild might have a longer lifespan, they are increasingly found close to human habitats. In the human habitats, Indian vultures are prone to higher mortality due to road kills, electrocution on high power lines, collision with trains and other high structures such as windmills. Apart from this, major cause of death has been NSAIDs including Diclofenac commonly given to cattle to reduce joint pain which believed to have been passed onto the vultures thorough the flesh of dead cattle causing kidney failure and death in vultures.

=== Reproduction ===

Indian vultures nest on cliffs, high buildings, and, more rarely, on trees. They sometimes build nests on old monuments and towers. A platform of sticks or twigs lined with leaves with the addition of green leaves advertising nest occupancy and fend off parasites.

Indian vultures reach breeding age at about five years old. Nest building starts in September and breeding happens between November and March. They often breed in monogamous pairs and the females lay only one egg a year. The egg is pure white or mottled with rusty spots. Both the parents take turns in incubating the egg and the egg hatches in about 50 days. The nests are often located near water sources such as rivers, lakes or ponds to enable them to maintain the humidity levels in the nests. The nests are located at higher altitudes with nearly 90% of the nests at an altitude of more than 900m.

==Status and conservation==
===Population decline and recovery===
Beginning in the 1990s, the Indian vulture species suffered a 97% population decrease in its range in the Indian subcontinent over a period of 10–15 years. The species is classified as critically endangered in the IUCN Red List since 2002 due to the rapid decline in population. Currently, there are only an estimated 5000 to 15000 birds in the wild.

This is conjunction with the rapid decline in the population of other related vulture species including the slender-billed vulture and white-rumped vulture. Between 2000 and 2007, the annual decline rates of this species averaged over sixteen percent. The cause of this rapid decline was identified as poisoning caused by the veterinary drug diclofenac. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly given to cattle to reduce joint pain. The drug is believed to have been passed onto the vultures thorough the flesh of dead cattle who were given diclofenac in their last days of life which then causes kidney failure in vultures. 

Data modelling revealed that a tiny proportion (about 0.8%) of livestock carcasses containing diclofenac can cause significant crash in vulture populations. The decline in vulture population had a huge socio-economic impact in the region and drastically affected the conservation of the ecological balance. By removing all carrion, vultures had helped decrease pollution, spread of diseases, and suppressed undesirable mammalian scavengers. Without vultures, a large number of animal carcasses were left to rot, posing a serious risk to human health by contaminating water supply and providing a potential breeding ground for infectious germs and proliferation of pests such as rats. The loss of vultures also resulted in a substantial increase in the population of feral dogs, whose bites are the most common cause of human rabies. The feral dog population in India increased by least 5 million, resulting in over 38 million additional dog bites and more than 47,000 extra deaths from rabies, costing $34 billion in economic impact. On average, it was estimated that human mortality rates increased by more than 4% during the period of 2000 to 2005, when vulture population reached the lowest levels.

In March 2006, the government of India announced a ban on the veterinary use of diclofenac. Meloxicam, another NSAID was rapidly metabolized and harmless to vultures was suggested as an acceptable substitute for diclofenac. Nepal banned the manufacture and importation of diclofenac in June 2006 and Pakistan followed suit in September 2006. Pharmaceutical companies were encouraged to the increase in the production of meloxicam aimed at reducing the cost down to diclofenac&#x27;s own levels to make it more suitable for use. In 2015, the government of India ordered the vial size of the drugs to be reduced to 3ml to reduce the dosage administered to cattle. In 2021, tolfenamic acid was identified as another alternative that is safe for vultures.

After banning the drug in 2006, the vulture population rebounded and with the combined population relatively stable till 2011. But, further decline of vulture populations were reported in some states in India. Despite the banning of diclofenac and reduction in usage by about 50%, the drug was still available for veterinary use. There were other compounds like aceclofenac and ketoprofen which were in use and were harmful. In 2008, the government of India enacted a law declaring the sale of diclofenac as a imprisonable offense. Later surveys found that the population was recovering slowly and the decline has been significantly slowed in India, Pakistan and Nepal following a strict ban on the drug.

===Conservation===
Captive-breeding programmes for the Indian vulture were started to help recover its numbers. As the vultures are long-lived, slow-breeding and notoriously difficult to breed in captivity, the programmes are expected to take longer. The captive-bred birds will be released to the wild when the environment is clear of diclofenac.

In 2014, &quot;Saving Asia&#x27;s Vultures from Extinction&quot; programme was announced to start releasing captive-bred birds into the wild by 2016. In 2016, Jatayu Conservation Breeding Centre, Pinjore released captive bred vultures into the wild as part of Asia&#x27;s first vulture re-introduction program. Small numbers of birds have bred across peninsular India, in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Three more breeding centers have been setup in the Indian states of West Bengal, Assam and Madhya Pradesh in addition to four smaller facilities in collaboration with zoos.

In 2020, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of Government of India has launched a Vulture Action Plan 2020-25. It aims to step up conservation measures and set up a mechanism to ensure that toxic drugs other than diclofenac are also banned for veterinary use.

In 2010, a small population of Indian vulture and three other species of vultures were discovered in the Moyar river valley in Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary, where 20 nests were sighted with a population of 40 adults. It was last sighted in the region in the 1970s and the rediscovery is significant to its conservation.

==Cultural and economic significance==

Indian vultures are often misunderstood, feared and considered as lowly creatures largely due to their eating habits of feeding on carrion. They play a key ecological role as a keystone species and serve as effective scavengers. In the Indian subcontinent, where there is a large population of cattle and few facilities for incineration and carcass processing, vultures effectively clean up the carcasses offering health benefits and save economical costs.

Jatayu is a demigod in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;, who has the form of either an eagle or a vulture.

The people of Parsi community in India leave the dead bodies exposed in high towers called Tower of Silence in order for the vultures to feed.

<doc id="186796" wikidata="Q892367" url="?curid=186796" title="First-rate">
<text>In the rating system of the Royal Navy used to categorise sailing warships, a first rate was the designation for the largest ships of the line. Originating in the Jacobean era with the designation of Ships Royal capable of carrying at least 400 men, the size and establishment of first-rates evolved over the following 250 years to eventually denote ships of the line carrying at least 80 guns across three gundecks. By the end of the eighteenth century, a first-rate carried no fewer than 100 guns and more than 850 crew, and had a measurement (burthen) tonnage of some 2,000 tons.

==Origins==
The concept of a rating system for British naval vessels dates to the accession of James I of England, following which the fleet was formally divided into &quot;great&quot;, &quot;middling&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot; craft. A 1618 commission of enquiry added a further designation of &quot;Ships Royal&quot; for the largest and most prestigious vessels in the fleet, each capable of carrying at least 400 men.

The first Ships Royal – , , , , and – were all converted galleons and included three very old vessels that had fought against the Spanish Armada in 1588. Their condition was generally poor, with &quot;Elizabeth Jonas&quot; and &quot;Triumph&quot; already completely unserviceable and &quot;White Bear&quot; so unseaworthy that she was sold for scrap in 1627.

The Navy&#x27;s rating system was later modified to differentiate ships considered suitable for various functions within the naval tactics of the age of sail. Lower numbers indicated larger and more capable ships. By the mid-18th century ships suitable for the line of battle were first-rate ships carrying at least 100 guns, second-rate ships carrying 84 to 98 guns, and larger third-rate ships carrying 70 to 80 guns. Smaller third-rate ships carrying about 60–64 guns, and fourth-rate ships of around 50 guns, had earlier been considered suitable, but were being phased out. Fifth-rate and sixth-rate ships were frigates usually maneuvering independently of the line of battle.

==Rating==

Early first rates had as few as 60 guns, but by the mid-1660s they generally carried between 90 and 100 guns. By the early years of the 18th century, it had become accepted that 100 guns was the standard criterion for a first rate in wartime (while 90 guns, later 98 guns, became the standard wartime ordnance for a second rate). (In peacetime, all ships of the line carried a reduced complement of guns.) Towards the close of the century, ships were built with more than 100 guns, and they too were classed as first rates.

In addition to the rated number of carriage-mounted guns (which included the heaviest calibre available mounted on their lower decks, with smaller guns on the decks above), first rates also carried a number of anti-personnel guns, initially swivel-mounted weapons. From the invention of the slide-mounted carronade in the later 1770s, first rates (like other warships), could mount a number of these weapons on their quarterdecks and forecastles to augment their short-range firepower, but they were not included in the ship&#x27;s rating until 1817 except where they replaced carriage-mounted guns.

Although very powerful, the Navy&#x27;s first-rates were of limited utility at sea. For stability their lowest gundeck had to be very close to the waterline and its gunports could not be opened in anything but the calmest of seas. To do otherwise was to risk swamping the entire vessel, as occurred in 1781 when the first-rate sank at anchor at Spithead after the lower gunports were opened to air the ship. Early first-rates had little storage space to stow provisions for their large crews on long voyages, and the ships themselves routinely proved unseaworthy in winter weather; as a consequence the first-rates were restricted to summer cruising, and then only in the English Channel and nearby waters. By the mid-1700s, however, improved design had removed these limitations.

Ships of this size were extremely expensive to operate. As a result, the few first rates (the Royal Navy had only five completed in 1794) were typically reserved as commanding admirals&#x27; flagships. First rates were typically kept out of commission (&quot;in Ordinary&quot;) during peacetime and only activated (&quot;commissioned&quot;) during times of conflict. This had the added advantage of preserving them from the wear and tear that smaller ships experienced in spending long periods at sea. Spending time in Ordinary could considerably extend a first rate&#x27;s lifespan; for instance, by the time she fought in the Battle of Trafalgar, had been in service for 40 years, although a portion of this time was spent in Ordinary.

With first rates being the most powerful ships of the navy, it was common to compare them with the navies of other nations; frequently one sees the largest ships of those navies being referred to as first rates. Other nations had their own rating systems, notably the French Navy with its system of five formal rates or &quot;rangs&quot;.

==Ships==
Due to their cost of construction and maintenance, only a small number of first rates could be built and maintained at any one time. Thus over the 250 years (approximately) that the rating system of the Royal Navy was used, only a relatively small number of these ships saw service.

Only one first rate has survived to the present. , Admiral Nelson&#x27;s flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar, is preserved at HMNB Portsmouth and is in commission. The hull of the 102-gun , which was built and operated entirely in fresh water during the War of 1812, survives intact in shallow water near shore in Kingston, Ontario, and is a popular diving attraction. Two other noted first rates were , which was broken up in 1841, and , which was broken up in 1825. Both these ships had 100 guns. Later first rates such as and its several sisters had 120 guns. Other navies, notably those of France and Spain, also had similar ships with more than 100 guns, the most heavily armed being the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot; which, following a rebuilding in 1802, carried 140 guns.

==Other usage==
The Royal Navy&#x27;s use of the term &quot;first-rate&quot; to describe its largest and most powerful vessels is the origin of the modern English-language meaning of &quot;exceptionally good&quot; or &quot;of the highest quality.&quot;

<text>John Leslie Prescott, Baron Prescott (31 May 1938 – 20 November 2024) was a British politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and as First Secretary of State from 2001 to 2007.

A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull East for 40 years, from 1970 to 2010. He was often seen as the political link to the working class in a Labour Party increasingly led by modernising, middle-class professionals such as Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson (although Prescott described himself as &quot;pretty middle class&quot;), and developed a reputation as a key conciliator in the often fractious relationship between Blair and Gordon Brown.

Born in Prestatyn, Wales, in his youth Prescott failed the eleven-plus entrance exam for grammar school and worked as a ship&#x27;s steward and trade union activist. He went on to graduate from Ruskin College and the University of Hull. In the 1994 Labour Party leadership election, he stood for both the leadership and deputy leadership, winning election to the latter office. He was appointed deputy prime minister after Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1997 election, with an expanded brief as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions until 2001, then subsequently as First Secretary of State until 2007. In June 2007, he resigned as deputy prime minister, coinciding with Blair&#x27;s resignation as prime minister. Following an election within the Labour Party, he was replaced as deputy leader by Harriet Harman.

After retiring as a member of Parliament at the 2010 general election, Prescott was made a life peer and sat in the House of Lords until 2024. He stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate in the 2012 election to be the first police and crime commissioner for Humberside Police. Prescott resigned from the Privy Council in 2013 in protest against delays to the introduction of press regulation, of which he had become a proponent. In February 2015, he briefly returned to politics as an adviser to Labour leader Ed Miliband.

==Early life==
Prescott was born in Prestatyn, Wales, on 31 May 1938 to John Herbert (&quot;Bert&quot;) Prescott and Phyllis, . Prescott&#x27;s father was a railway signalman, Justice of the Peace, and Labour councillor. His family won a competition to find the &quot;most typical British family of 1951&quot;. In 2009, he said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt very proud of Wales and being Welsh ... I was born in Wales, went to school in Wales and my mother was Welsh. I&#x27;m Welsh. It&#x27;s my place of birth, my country.&quot; He left Wales in 1942 at the age of four and was brought up initially in Brinsworth, Rotherham, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He attended Brinsworth Manor School, where in 1949 he sat but failed the 11-Plus examination to attend Rotherham Grammar School. Shortly afterwards, his family moved to Upton-by-Chester, and he attended Grange Secondary Modern School in nearby Ellesmere Port.

Prescott became a steward and waiter in the Merchant Navy, working for Cunard, and was a left-wing union activist. Among the passengers was a former prime minister, Anthony Eden, recuperating after his resignation over the Suez Crisis. Prescott reportedly described Eden as a &quot;real gentleman&quot;. Apart from serving Eden, who stayed in his cabin much of the time, Prescott also won several boxing contests, at which Eden presented the prizes. He married Pauline &quot;Tilly&quot; Tilston at Upton Church in Chester on 11 November 1961. He then went to Ruskin College, which specialises in courses for union officials, where he gained a diploma in economics and politics in 1965. In 1968, he obtained a BSc degree in economics and economic history from the University of Hull.

==Member of Parliament==
Prescott returned to the National Union of Seamen as a full-time official before being elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull East in 1970, succeeding Commander Harry Pursey, the retiring Labour MP, and defeating the Conservative challenger Norman Lamont. He had previously attempted to become MP for Southport in 1966, but came in second place, approximately 9,500 votes behind the Conservative candidate. From July 1975 to 1979, he concurrently served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and Leader of the Labour Group, when its members were nominated by the national Parliaments. In 1988 Prescott and Eric Heffer challenged Roy Hattersley for the deputy leadership of the party, but Hattersley was re-elected as deputy leader. Prescott stood again in the 1992 deputy leadership election, following Hattersley&#x27;s retirement, but lost to Margaret Beckett.

Prescott held various posts in Labour&#x27;s shadow cabinet, but his career was secured by an impassioned closing speech in the debate at the Labour Party Conference in 1993 on the introduction of &quot;one member, one vote&quot; for the selection and reselection of Labour Parliamentary candidates that helped swing the vote in favour of this reform. In 1994 Prescott was a candidate in the party leadership election that followed the death of leader John Smith, standing for the positions of both leader and deputy leader. Tony Blair won the leadership contest, with Prescott being elected deputy leader.

==Deputy Prime Minister==
With the formation of a Labour government in 1997, Prescott was made Deputy Prime Minister and given a very large portfolio as the head of the newly created Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions. In the United Kingdom, the title of Deputy Prime Minister is used only occasionally, and confers no constitutional powers (in which it is similar to the pre-20th century usage of Prime Minister). The deputy prime minister stands in when the prime minister is unavailable, most visibly at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, and Prescott attended various Heads of Government meetings on behalf of Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Since the position of deputy prime minister draws no salary, Prescott&#x27;s remuneration was based on his position as Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions until 2001. This &quot;super department&quot; was then broken up, with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department for Transport established as separate entities. Prescott, still deputy prime minister, was also given the largely honorific title of First Secretary of State. In July 2001 an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) was created to administer the areas remaining under his responsibility. This was originally part of the Cabinet Office, but became a department in its own right in May 2002, when it absorbed some of the responsibilities of the former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. The ODPM had responsibility for local and regional government, housing, communities and the fire service.

===Environment, Transport and the Regions===
====Environment====
The UK played a major role in the successful negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and Prescott led the UK delegation at the discussions. In May 2006, in recognition of his work in delivering the Kyoto Treaty, Tony Blair asked him to work with the Foreign Secretary and the Environment Secretary on developing the Government&#x27;s post-Kyoto agenda.

As minister on 24 August 1999, Prescott made regulations banning the use of chrysotile asbestos, which resulted in a complete ban on the use of any products containing asbestos in the United Kingdom from 24 November 1999.

====Integrated transport policy====
On coming to office, Prescott pursued an integrated public transport policy. On 6 June 1997, he said: &quot;I will have failed if in five years time there are not...far fewer journeys by car. It&#x27;s a tall order but I urge you to hold me to it.&quot; However, by June 2002, car traffic was up by 7%. This prompted Friends of the Earth&#x27;s Tony Bosworth to say &quot;By its own test, Government transport policy has failed&quot;.

Prescott successfully focused attention on the role of car usage in the bigger environmental picture, and the need for effective public transport alternatives if car volume was to be reduced. The subsequent debate on road pricing evolved from his policy. A contrast was highlighted between Prescott&#x27;s transport brief and an incident, in 1999, when an official chauffeur-driven car was used to transport Prescott and his wife from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference, where Prescott gave a speech on how to encourage the use of public transport. Prescott explained, &quot;Because of the security reasons for one thing and second, my wife doesn&#x27;t like to have her hair blown about. Have you got another silly question?&quot; Prescott was fined for speeding on four occasions.

====Rail regulation====
Prescott had a stormy relationship with the privatisation of the railway industry. He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party&#x27;s policy, established in 1996 just before the flotation of Railtrack on the London Stock Exchange, of committing to renationalise the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning that it would never be done. Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by shadow transport secretary Clare Short, that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created Strategic Rail Authority in the case of the passenger train operators, and the Rail Regulator in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack. The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party&#x27;s statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.

In 1998, Prescott was criticised by Transport Minister John Reid for his statement – at the Labour Party conference that year – that the privatised railway was a &quot;national disgrace&quot;, despite receiving a standing ovation from the Labour Party audience. The companies said that they had had some considerable successes in cutting costs and generating new revenues in the short time since their transfer to private sector hands, and that the criticisms were premature and unfair.

In that speech, Prescott also announced that he would be taking a far tougher line with the companies, and to that end he would be having a &quot;spring clean&quot; of the industry. In July 1998 Prescott published a transport White Paper stating that the rail industry needed an element of stability and certainty if it was to plan its activities effectively.

In February 1999, the regulation of the passenger rail operators fell to Sir Alastair Morton, who Prescott announced would be appointed as chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, which would take over from the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising whose office would be wound up. In July 1999, the new Rail Regulator appointed by Prescott was Tom Winsor. They shared Prescott&#x27;s view that the railway industry needed a considerable shake-up in its institutional, operational, engineering and economic matrix to attract and retain private investment and enable the companies within it to become strong, competent and successful.

===Local and regional government===
Prescott, responsible for local government, introduced a new system guiding members&#x27; conduct after 2001. The new system included a nationally agreed Code of Conduct laid down by statutory instrument which all local authorities were required to adopt; the Code of Conduct gives guidance on when councillors have an interest in a matter under discussion and when that interest is prejudicial so that the councillor may not speak or vote on the matter. Although on many areas councillors had previously been expected to withdraw where they had declared an interest, the new system was more formal and introduced specific sanctions for breaches; it was criticised for preventing councillors from representing the views of their local communities.

Prescott supported regional government in England. Early in his term, he introduced regional assemblies consisting of delegates from local authorities and other regional stakeholders to oversee the work of new Regional Development Agencies in the regions of England. Following Labour&#x27;s second election victory, he pressed for the introduction of elected regional assemblies, which would have seen about 25 to 35 members elected under a similar electoral system to that used for the London Assembly. However, because of opposition, the government was forced to hold regional referendums on the change. The first three were intended to be in the North-East, North-West and Yorkshire and the Humber. The North-East referendum, where support was felt to be strongest, was first, in November 2004, but the vote was 78% against, an overwhelming margin, and the plan for elected regional assemblies was shelved.

===Housing===
A rising number of households (especially in the south-east) were putting added pressure on housing during Prescott&#x27;s tenure as the minister responsible. An increase in the housebuilding was proposed, primarily on brownfield sites, but also on some undeveloped &quot;greenfield&quot; areas and as a result he was accused of undermining the Green Belt. During a radio interview in January 1998, Prescott was asked about housing development on the green belt; intending to convey that the government would enlarge green belt protection, Prescott replied: &quot;It&#x27;s a Labour achievement, and we mean to build on it&quot;. He had not intended to make a joke and was distressed when it prompted laughter.

In the north of England, Prescott approved the demolition of some 200,000 homes that were judged to be in &quot;failing areas&quot; as part of his &quot;Pathfinder&quot; regeneration scheme. It has been argued that renovating properties, rather than demolishing them, would have made better financial and community sense.

Prescott led the campaign to abolish council housing, which ran out of steam when tenants in Birmingham voted to stay with the council in 2002. A previous attempt to privatise all the council housing in the London Borough of Camden failed in 1997.

===Opposition to education reforms===
On 17 December 2005, Prescott made public his disapproval of Tony Blair&#x27;s plans to give state schools the right to govern their finances and admission policies and to increase the number of city academies. It was the first policy stance that Prescott had made against Blair since his election as leader in 1994. Prescott said that the move would create a two-tier educational system that would discriminate against the working class. He added that Labour were &quot;always better fighting class&quot;.

===Links with the grass roots===
Prescott, sometimes described as old-school trades unionist, kept in touch with the views of the traditional Labour voters throughout his career. He became an important figure in Tony Blair&#x27;s &quot;New Labour&quot; movement, as the representative of &#x27;old Labour&#x27; interests in the Shadow cabinet and subsequently around the Cabinet table as Deputy Prime Minister.

However, now a member of the establishment, relationships with the grass roots were not always smooth. Whilst attending the Brit Awards in 1998, Chumbawamba member Danbert Nobacon poured a jug of iced water over Prescott, saying, &quot;This is for the Liverpool Dockers&quot;. Dock workers in Liverpool had been involved in a two-year industrial dispute: a strike that had turned into a lock-out, until a few weeks earlier. A reporter from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; threw water over Nobacon the following day.

===Abolition of department===
In a Cabinet reshuffle on 5 May 2006, Prescott&#x27;s departmental responsibilities were transferred to Ruth Kelly, as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, following revelations about his private life and a poor performance by Labour in that year&#x27;s local elections. He remained as Deputy Prime Minister, with a seat in the Cabinet, and was given a role as a special envoy to the Far East as well as additional responsibilities chairing cabinet committees. Despite having lost his departmental responsibilities it was announced that he would retain his full salary (£134,000pa) and pension entitlements, along with both his grace-and-favour homes, an announcement which received considerable criticism.

The press speculated in July 2006 that, as a consequence of the continuing problems centred on Prescott, Blair was preparing to replace him as Deputy Prime Minister with David Miliband, whilst possibly retaining Prescott as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.

===Announcement of retirement===
In a speech to the 2006 Labour Party Conference in Manchester, Prescott apologised for the bad press he had caused the party during the previous year. He said: &quot;I know in the last year I let myself down, I let you down. So Conference, I just want to say sorry&quot;, and confirmed that he would stand down as deputy leader when Blair resigned the premiership. Prescott subsequently announced in the House of Commons that he was &quot;... in a rather happy demob stage&quot;, in January 2007.

Within 30 minutes of Blair announcing the date of his resignation on 10 May 2007, Prescott announced his resignation as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. During the subsequent special Labour Party Conference, Gordon Brown was elected Leader and Harriet Harman succeeded Prescott as Deputy Leader.

==Life after government==

Following his resignation from the government, Prescott took over from Tony Lloyd as the lead UK Representative in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In a jocular response to the appointment, Shadow Europe Minister Mark Francois wished the translators good luck. The post was unpaid but had an expenses allowance and allowed him to sit on the Assembly of the Western European Union. He used his role on the council to make his campaign against slave labour a key issue.

Prescott stood down as an MP at the next general election. His autobiography, &quot;Prezza, My Story: Pulling no Punches&quot; was published on 29 May 2008 and ghostwritten by Hunter Davies. During the 2010 general election campaign, Prescott toured the UK in a customised white transit van dubbed his &quot;Battlebus&quot; canvassing support for the Labour Party. Prescott was publicly very supportive of Gordon Brown, and called him a &quot;global giant&quot;.

It was announced on 28 May 2010 that Prescott was to be awarded a life peerage, The peerage was gazetted on 15 June in the 2010 Dissolution Honours. He was introduced into the House on 8 July as Baron Prescott, &quot;of Kingston upon Hull in the County of East Yorkshire&quot;, and the Letters patent were gazetted on 12 July, dated 7 July.

Prescott was a director of Super League rugby league club Hull Kingston Rovers, who are based in his former constituency of Kingston upon Hull East. Prescott ran for Labour Party Treasurer in September 2010 but was defeated by Diana Holland, who took 68.96% of the total vote.

On 30 July 2010, Prescott appeared before the panel at the Chilcot Inquiry concerning the Iraq War. Prescott stated that he was doubtful about the legality, intelligence and information about Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction. The inquiry was launched by Gordon Brown in the summer of 2009 shortly after operations in the war ended. In 2016, after publication of the resultant Chilcot Report, which was critical of the war but remained neutral on its legality, Prescott declared that the invasion by UK and US forces had been &quot;illegal&quot; and that members of Tony Blair&#x27;s Cabinet &quot;were given too little paper documentation to make decisions&quot;.

In February 2012, Prescott announced he would stand for Labour&#x27;s nomination in the election to be the first Police and crime commissioner for Humberside Police. In June he was selected as the Labour candidate for the election in November 2012. In the November election Prescott won the most first preference votes but ended up losing to Conservative Matthew Grove in the second count.

In March 2013, Prescott suggested that the Queen, Elizabeth II, should abdicate due to her health. Prescott was criticised for his position by several MPs.

On 6 July 2013, Prescott revealed in a newspaper column that he had resigned from the Privy Council in protest against the delays to the introduction of press regulation. The resignation only became effective on 6 November the same year. The Coalition Government had insisted that the Privy Council must consider a cross-party Royal Charter to underpin a new system of regulation, but that this meant that a final decision would not be taken before 2015.

On 21 February 2015, it was announced Prescott would return to politics as an adviser to Labour leader Ed Miliband. This was a brief return, as Labour lost the imminent general election.

In October 2015, Prescott was presented with the Shechtman International Leadership Award at the Sustainable Industrial Processing Summit 2015 in Antalya, Turkey, for his contributions to sustainable development in politics.

Prescott ceased to be a member of the House of Lords on 9 July 2024 under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 because of non-attendance in the preceding session of Parliament. He retained his peerage.

===Television appearances===
In June 2008, Prescott made a cameo appearance, playing a policeman, in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Robert Tressell&#x27;s &quot;The Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists&quot;. In 2009, he made a brief cameo appearance as himself in the final episode of the BBC Three comedy series &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; (this referred to a running joke in the show regarding a relationship the character Nessa had had with him many years previously). Beginning on 7 January 2011, Prescott appeared in a TV advert for price comparison website moneysupermarket.com, along with comedian Omid Djalili, which gently mocks events in his political career. On 27 February 2011, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; as the &quot;Star in the Reasonably Priced Car&quot;, where he set a lap time of 1.56.7, the second slowest in a Kia Ceed. He also engaged in a discussion with host Jeremy Clarkson regarding his time in Government.

In October and November 2008, Prescott was the subject of a two-part documentary, &quot;Prescott: the Class System and Me&quot;, on BBC Two, looking at the class system in Britain, and asking whether it still exists. In 2009, he featured in the BBC Wales TV series &quot;Coming Home&quot; about his Welsh family history, with roots in Prestatyn and Chirk. In October 2009, he was featured in another BBC Two documentary, &quot;Prescott: The North/South Divide&quot;, in which he and his wife Pauline explored the current state of the North-South Divide from their perspective as Northern Englanders long used to living in the south of the country.

In April 2015 Prescott appeared as a guest on the television panel show &quot;Have I Got News For You&quot;. During the episode he had a &quot;pretty heated&quot; interaction with team captain Ian Hislop.

In 2019, Prescott hosted the television series &quot;Made in Yorkshire&quot; (also known as &quot;Made in Britain: Yorkshire&quot;) for Channel 5, in which he explored the manufacturing of some of Britain&#x27;s favourite foods.

==Public profile==
Prescott gained a reputation in the press for confused speech, mangled syntax and poor grammar. &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Simon Hoggart once commented: &quot;Every time Prescott opens his mouth, it&#x27;s like someone has flipped open his head and stuck in an egg whisk.&quot; An oft-quoted but unverified story in Jeremy Paxman&#x27;s &quot;The Political Animal&quot; is that, before being accepted as transcribers to the Parliamentary record &quot;Hansard&quot;, applicants must listen to one of Prescott&#x27;s speeches and write down what they think he was trying to say. However, Liz Davies wrote that on the Labour National Executive Committee, Prescott &quot;spoke in clear, concise sentences and his point was always understandable. Contrary to his television and parliamentary image, he appears to choose his words with care.&quot;

The media attached various sobriquets to Prescott during his political career. Originally, Prescott&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Prezza&quot;, but as various misfortunes befell him the sobriquets became more colourful, leading to &quot;Two Jags&quot;, which set the template for later nicknames. Prescott owned one Jaguar, and had the use of another as his official ministerial car. A later version of this term was &quot;Two Jabs&quot;, following his retaliation against a protester farmer in 2001, and &quot;Two Shacks&quot;, referring to his former country house. When he lost his department in a cabinet reshuffle following exposure of his affair, newspapers dubbed him &quot;Two Shags&quot; and &quot;No Jobs&quot;. Banned from driving after being convicted of speeding in 1991, Prescott was banned again after a similar conviction in June 2015.

===&#x27;Prescott punch&#x27;===
During the 2001 election campaign, Prescott was campaigning in Rhyl, Denbighshire, when Craig Evans threw an egg at him. Prescott, a former amateur boxer, responded immediately with a left jab punch to the jaw. The incident, overshadowing the launch of the Labour Party manifesto on that day, was captured by television cameras. Tony Blair responded by stating: &quot;John is John&quot;. A National Opinion Polls (NOP) survey found that the incident did no public harm to Prescott, and may even have benefited his standing amongst male voters. Speaking on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Prescott stated: &quot;I was against fox-hunting, and he thought I was one of the guys he hated because I wanted to keep fox-hunting&quot;. He elaborated:

This incident earned Prescott the nickname &quot;Two Jabs&quot;, a reference to his existing nickname, &quot;Two Jags&quot;.

===Council tax===
In 2003, Prescott gave up a home that he had rented from the RMT Union in Clapham; he had left the union in June 2002. Prescott paid £220 a month for the property – a fifth of its market value. Though he had not declared the flat in the register of members&#x27; interests, he was subsequently exonerated by MPs who overruled Elizabeth Filkin, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. On 12 January 2006, Prescott apologised after it was revealed that the council tax for the government flat he occupied at Admiralty House was paid from public money, rather than his private income. He repaid the amount, which came to £3,830.52 over nearly nine years.

===Sexual infidelity ===
Prescott came under fire for additional controversies over sexual infidelity. On 26 April 2006, he admitted to having had an affair with his diary secretary, Tracey Temple, between 2002 and 2004. This two-year affair was said to have commenced after an office party and, in part, took place during meetings at Prescott&#x27;s grace-and-favour flat in Whitehall. Conservative MP Andrew Robathan tabled questions in the House of Commons over Prescott&#x27;s reported entertainment of Temple at Dorneywood, his official residence, which raised questions over the possible misuse of public finances.

===Sexual assault allegation===
On 7 May 2006, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; quoted Linda McDougall, wife of Austin Mitchell, as saying that in 1978 Prescott had pushed her &quot;quite forcefully&quot; against a wall and put his hand up her skirt as she opened the door for him to a meeting in her own house just after her husband became an MP.

===Expenses claims===
On 8 May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; began publishing leaked details of MPs&#x27; expenses. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that Prescott had claimed £312 for fitting mock Tudor beams to his constituency home, and for two new toilet seats in as many years. Prescott responded by saying, &quot;Every expense was within the rules of the House of Commons on claiming expenses at the time&quot;.

=== Other incidents ===
Prescott was criticised for maintaining the benefits of Deputy Prime Minister despite losing his department in 2006. He was criticised for visiting the American billionaire Phil Anschutz who was bidding for the government licence to build a super casino in the UK, and questioned over his involvement in the business of his son Johnathan Prescott. He was photographed playing croquet at Dorneywood, his then &quot;grace and favour&quot; home, when Tony Blair was out of the country on a visit to Washington. Prescott was mocked in the media – in part because the game was so divorced from his working-class roots – and he gave up the use of the house. He later said that it had been his staff&#x27;s idea to play croquet and that contrary to press reports, he had not been Acting Prime Minister when he had played the game.

==Personal life, illness and death==
Prescott married Pauline Tilston in 1961. They had two sons. Their younger son, David Prescott, is active in Labour Party politics and works in the office of former party leader Jeremy Corbyn; he failed to be selected for his father&#x27;s parliamentary seat in Hull but was the Labour candidate for Gainsborough in 2015. Tilston had already had a son by an American airman in the 1950s, whom she gave up for adoption. In an episode of &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; broadcast in February 2012, Prescott said he acknowledged Pauline&#x27;s first son as part of his family, a third son.

Prescott disclosed in 2002 that he had been diagnosed with diabetes in 1990. He was briefly hospitalised in June 2007, diagnosed with pneumonia, and treated at University College Hospital, London. In 2008, Prescott recounted having suffered from the eating disorder bulimia nervosa, which he believed was brought on by stress, from the 1980s until 2007. Prescott was admitted to Hull Royal Infirmary in June 2019 after a stroke. He subsequently returned to his duties, but spoke in the House of Lords on only one subsequent occasion and last voted in February 2023. He ceased to be a member of the House of Lords in July 2024 due to non-attendance.

Prescott died on 20 November 2024, aged 86; his family said that he had been living in a care home with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Blair and Brown paid tribute, along with incumbent prime minister Keir Starmer and incumbent deputy prime minister Angela Rayner. His funeral took place in Hull Minster on 30 January 2025.

<text>Sayyid Kamal Kharazi (, born 1 December 1944) is an Iranian reformist politician and diplomat who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 20 August 1997 to 24 August 2005 as appointed by President Mohammad Khatami serving for eight years. He was replaced by Manouchehr Mottaki who was appointed by the next President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He is currently member of the Expediency Discernment Council.

==Early life and education==
Kharazi was born in Tehran in 1944. He got his Bachelor degree in Arabic language and literature, and after receiving his master&#x27;s degree in education at the University of Tehran, he spent a year (1975–1976) as teaching fellow at the University of Houston, where he received a PhD in industrial psychology.

==Career==

Kharazi has been a Professor of Management and Educational Psychology at Tehran University since 1983. Kharazi was a founding member of the Islamic Research Institute in London.

Kharazi has held a number of governmental, diplomatic and academic posts and headed Iranian delegations at numerous international conferences, most importantly at the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. For several years Kharazi presented the official Iranian position on TV and at university campuses in the United States and Europe, and has written extensively on foreign policy issues. He had extensive experience in guiding the media during the early days of Iran&#x27;s Iranian Revolution.

From July 1980 to September 1989, he was the President of the Islamic Republic News Agency. On 18 September 1980, the Iran–Iraq War broke out, and Kharazi served as a member of the Supreme Defense Council of Iran and headed the War Information Headquarters and served as a military spokesman for most of the war (from September 1980 to September 1988).

During the first months after the Iranian Revolution, Kharazi served as the Vice-President of Iranian National Television (March to August 1979) for the new Islamic state. He then served as the Vice-Minister for Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (from August 1979 to March 1980) and as the Managing Director of the Center for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults (from August 1979 to July 1981).
Previously, he represented Iran at the United Nations from 1989 to 1997.

== Family ==
Kharazi is married with two children. His nephew, Sadegh Kharazi, is Iran&#x27;s ambassador to Paris and played a key role in developing the so-called roadmap or &#x27;Swiss memo&#x27;.

<doc id="186803" wikidata="Q311214" url="?curid=186803" title="Robin Cook">
<text>Robert Finlayson &quot;Robin&quot; Cook (28 February 19466 August 2005) was a British Labour Party politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 until his death in 2005 and served in the Cabinet as Foreign Secretary from 1997 until 2001 when he was replaced by Jack Straw. He then served as Leader of the House of Commons from 2001 until 2003.

Cook studied at the University of Edinburgh before being elected as the Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Central in 1974; he switched to the Livingston constituency in 1983. In Parliament, he was known for his debating ability and rapidly rose through the political ranks and ultimately into the Cabinet. As Foreign Secretary, he oversaw British interventions in Kosovo and Sierra Leone.

Cook resigned from his positions as Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons on 17 March 2003 in protest against the invasion of Iraq. At the time of his death, he was President of the Foreign Policy Centre and a Vice-President of the America All Party Parliamentary Group and the Global Security and Non-Proliferation All Party Parliamentary Group.

==Early life==

Robin Cook was born in the County Hospital, Bellshill, Scotland, the only son of Peter and Christina Cook (née Lynch) (29 May 1912 – 20 March 2003). His father was a chemistry teacher who grew up in Fraserburgh, and his grandfather was a miner before being blacklisted for being involved in a strike.

Cook was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and, from 1960, the Royal High School in Edinburgh. At first, Cook intended to become a Church of Scotland minister, but lost his faith as he discovered politics. He joined the Labour Party in 1965 and became an atheist. He remained so for the rest of his life.

He then studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh, where he obtained a postgraduate MA with Honours in English Literature. He began studying for a PhD on Charles Dickens and Victorian serial novels, supervised by John Sutherland, but gave it up in 1970.

In 1971, after a period working as a secondary school teacher, Cook became a tutor-organiser of the Workers&#x27; Educational Association for Lothian, and a local councillor in Edinburgh. He gave up both posts when he was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) on his twenty-eighth birthday, in February 1974.

==Early years in Parliament==

Cook unsuccessfully contested the Edinburgh North constituency at the 1970 general election, but was elected to the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election as Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Central, defeating George Foulkes for nomination. In 1981, Cook was a member of the anti-nuclear Labour Party Defence Study Group.

When the constituency boundaries were revised for the 1983 general election, he transferred to the new Livingston constituency after Tony Benn declined to run for the seat. Cook represented Livingston until his death. In parliament, Cook joined the left-wing Tribune Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party and frequently opposed the policies of the Wilson and Callaghan governments. He was an early supporter of constitutional and electoral reform (he opposed devolution in the 1979 referendum but came out in favour on election night in 1983) and of efforts to increase the number of female MPs. In May 2005, one month before he died, Cook said: &quot;My nightmare is that we will have been 12 years in office, with the ability to reform the electoral system, and will fail to do so until we are back in opposition, in perhaps a decade of Conservative government, regretting that we left in place the electoral system that allowed Conservative governments on a minority vote.&quot;

Cook supported unilateral nuclear disarmament and the abandoning of the Labour Party&#x27;s euroscepticism of the 1970s and 1980s. During his early years in parliament, Cook championed several liberalising social measures, to mixed effect. He repeatedly (and unsuccessfully) introduced a private member&#x27;s bill on divorce reform in Scotland, but succeeded in July 1980and after three years&#x27; tryingwith an amendment to bring the Scottish law on homosexuality into line with that in England. After Labour were defeated at the general election in May 1979, Cook supported Michael Foot&#x27;s leadership bid and joined his campaign committee. When Tony Benn challenged Denis Healey for the party&#x27;s deputy leadership in September 1981, Cook supported Healey.

==In opposition==

Cook became known as a brilliant parliamentary debater, and rose through the party ranks, becoming a frontbench spokesman in 1980, and reaching the Shadow Cabinet in June 1983, as spokesperson on European affairs. He was campaign manager for Neil Kinnock&#x27;s successful 1983 bid to become leader of the Labour Party. A year later he was made party campaign co-ordinator but in October 1986 Cook was surprisingly voted out of the shadow cabinet. He was re-elected in July 1987 and in October 1988 elected to Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee. He was one of the key figures in the modernisation of the Labour Party under Kinnock. He was Shadow Health Secretary (1987–92) and Shadow Trade Secretary (1992–94), before taking on foreign affairs in 1994, the post he would become most identified with (Shadow Foreign Secretary 1994–97, Foreign Secretary 1997–2001).

In 1994, following the death of John Smith, he ruled himself out of contention for the Labour leadership, apparently on the grounds that he was &quot;insufficiently attractive&quot; to be an election winner, although two close family bereavements in the week in which the decision had to be made may have contributed.

On 26 February 1996, following the publication of the Scott Report into the &#x27;Arms-to-Iraq&#x27; affair, he made a speech in response to the then President of the Board of Trade Ian Lang in which he said: &quot;this is not just a Government which does not know how to accept blame; it is a Government which knows no shame&quot;. His parliamentary performance on the occasion of the publication of the five-volume, 2,000-page Scott Reportwhich he claimed he was given just two hours to read before the relevant debate, thus giving him three seconds to read every pagewas widely praised on both sides of the House as one of the best performances the Commons had seen in years and one of Cook&#x27;s finest hours. The government won the vote by a majority of one.

As Joint Chairman (alongside Liberal Democrat MP Robert Maclennan) of the Labour-Liberal Democrat Joint Consultative Committee on Constitutional Reform, Cook brokered the &#x27;Cook-Maclennan Agreement&#x27; that laid the basis for the fundamental reshaping of the British constitution outlined in Labour&#x27;s 1997 general election manifesto. This led to legislation for major reforms including Scottish and Welsh devolution, the Human Rights Act and removing the majority of hereditary peers from the House of Lords.

==In government==

===Foreign Secretary===

With the election of a Labour government led by Tony Blair at the 1997 general election, Cook became Foreign Secretary. He was believed to have coveted the job of Chancellor of the Exchequer, but that job was reportedly promised by Tony Blair to Gordon Brown. He announced, to much scepticism, his intention to add &quot;an ethical dimension&quot; to foreign policy.

His term as Foreign Secretary was marked by British interventions in Kosovo and Sierra Leone. Both of these were controversial, the former because it was not sanctioned by the UN Security Council, and the latter because of allegations that the British company Sandline International had supplied arms to supporters of the deposed president in contravention of a United Nations embargo. Cook was also embarrassed when his apparent offer to mediate in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir was rebuffed. The ethical dimension of his policies was subject to inevitable scrutiny, leading to criticism at times.

Cook was responsible for achieving the agreement between the UK and Iran that ended the Iranian death threat against author Salman Rushdie, allowing both nations to normalize diplomatic relations. He is also credited with having helped resolve the eight-year impasse over the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial by getting Libya to agree to hand over the two accused (Megrahi and Fhimah) in 1999, for trial in the Netherlands according to Scots law.

In March 1998, a diplomatic rift ensued with Israel when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled a dinner with Cook, while Cook was visiting Israel and had demonstrated opposition to the expansion of Israeli settlements.

Although reported to have had republican sympathies, he and Queen Elizabeth II were said to be on good terms due to their mutual interest in horses.

===Leader of the House of Commons===

Following the 2001 general election he was moved, against his wishes, from the Foreign Office to be Leader of the House of Commons. This was widely seen as a demotionalthough it is a Cabinet post, it is substantially less prestigious than the Foreign Officeand Cook nearly turned it down. In the end he accepted, and looking on the bright side welcomed the chance to spend more time on his favourite stage. According to &quot;The Observer&quot;, it was Blair&#x27;s fears over political battles within the Cabinet over Europe, and especially the Euro, which saw him demote the pro-European Cook.

As Leader of the House, he was responsible for reforming the hours and practices of the Commons and for leading the debate on reform of the House of Lords. He also spoke for the Government during the controversy surrounding the membership of Commons Select Committees which arose in 2001, where Government whips were accused of pushing aside the outspoken committee chairs Gwyneth Dunwoody and Donald Anderson. He was President of the Party of European Socialists from May 2001 to April 2004.

In early 2003, during a television appearance on BBC&#x27;s debating series &quot;Question Time&quot;, he was inadvertently referred to as &quot;Robin Cock&quot; by David Dimbleby. Cook responded with good humour with &quot;Yes, David Bumblebee&quot;, and Dimbleby apologised twice on air for his slip. The episode also saw Cook in the uncomfortable position of defending the Government&#x27;s stance over the impending invasion of Iraq, weeks before his resignation over the issue.

He documented his time as Leader of the House of Commons in a widely acclaimed memoir &quot;The Point of Departure&quot;, which discussed in diary form his efforts to reform the House of Lords and to persuade his ministerial colleagues, including Tony Blair, to distance the Labour Government from the foreign policy of the Bush administration. The former political editor of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, Elinor Goodman called the book &#x27;the best insight yet into the workings of the Blair cabinet&#x27;, the former editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;, Will Hutton, called it &quot;the political book of the yeara lucid and compelling insider&#x27;s account of the two years that define the Blair Prime Ministership&quot;.

===Resignation over Iraq war===

In early 2003, he was reported to be one of the cabinet&#x27;s chief opponents of military action against Iraq, and on 17 March he resigned from the Cabinet. In a statement giving his reasons for resigning, he said, &quot;I can&#x27;t accept collective responsibility for the decision to commit Britain now to military action in Iraq without international agreement or domestic support.&quot; He also praised Blair&#x27;s &quot;heroic efforts&quot; in pushing for the so-called second resolution regarding the Iraq disarmament crisis, but lamented &quot;The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partnernot NATO, not the European Union and, now, not the Security Council&quot;. Cook&#x27;s heartfelt resignation speech in the House of Commons received an unprecedented standing ovation from some fellow MPs, and was described by the BBC&#x27;s Andrew Marr as &quot;without doubt one of the most effective, brilliant resignation speeches in modern British politics.&quot; Most unusually for the British parliament, Cook&#x27;s speech was met with growing applause from all sides of the House and from the public gallery. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;″s obituary, that was the first speech ever to receive a standing ovation in the history of the House.

==Outside the government==

Following his 2003 resignation from the Cabinet, Cook remained an active backbench Member of Parliament until his death. After leaving the Government, Cook was a leading analyst of the decision to go to war in Iraq, giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee which was later relevant during the Hutton and Butler inquiries. He was sceptical of the proposals contained in the Government&#x27;s Higher Education Bill, and abstained on its second reading. He also took strong positions in favour of both the proposed European Constitution, and the reform of the House of Lords to create a majority-elected second chamber, about which he said (while he was Leader of the Commons), &quot;I do not see how [the House of Lords] can be a democratic second Chamber if it is also an election-free zone&quot;.

In October 2004, Cook hosted an episode of the long-running BBC panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;.

In the years after his exit from the Foreign Office, and particularly following his resignation from the Cabinet, Cook made up with Gordon Brown after decades of personal animosity — an unlikely reconciliation after a mediation attempt by Frank Dobson in the early 1990s had seen Dobson conclude (to John Smith) &quot;You&#x27;re right. They hate each other.&quot; Cook and Brown focused on their common political ground, discussing how to firmly entrench progressive politics after the exit of Tony Blair. Chris Smith said in 2005 that in recent years Cook had been setting out a vision of &quot;libertarian, democratic socialism that was beginning to break the sometimes sterile boundaries of &#x27;old&#x27; and &#x27;New&#x27; Labour labels&quot;. With Blair&#x27;s popularity waning, Cook campaigned vigorously in the run-up to the 2005 general election to persuade Labour doubters to remain with the party.

In a column for the &quot;Guardian&quot; four weeks before his death, Cook caused a stir when he described Al-Qaeda as a product of a western intelligence:

Some commentators and senior politicians said that Cook seemed destined for a senior Cabinet post under a Brown premiership.

In the 2005 general election, his first election as a backbencher in over 20 years, he held his Livingston seat with an increased majority of 13,097, where he remained until his death 3 months later.

==Personal life==

Cook&#x27;s first wife was Margaret Katherine Whitmore, from Somerset, whom he met at Edinburgh University. They married on 15 September 1969 at St Alban&#x27;s Church, Westbury Park, Bristol and had two sons.

Shortly after he became Foreign Secretary, Cook ended his relationship with Margaret, revealing that he was having an extramarital affair with one of his staff, Gaynor Regan. He announced his intentions to leave his wife via a press statement made at Heathrow on 2 August 1997. Cook was forced into a decision over his private life following a telephone conversation with Alastair Campbell as he was about to go on holiday with his first wife. Campbell explained that the press was about to break the story of his affair with Regan. His estranged wife subsequently accused him of having had several extramarital affairs and alleged he had a habit of drinking heavily.

Cook married Regan in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on 9 April 1998, four weeks after his divorce was finalised.

Introduced to horse racing by his first wife, Cook was a racing tipster in his spare time. Between 1991 and 1998 Cook wrote a weekly tipster&#x27;s column for Glasgow&#x27;s &quot;Herald&quot; newspaper, a post in which he was succeeded by Alex Salmond.

==Death==

At the start of August 2005, Cook and his wife, Gaynor, took a two-week holiday in the Scottish Highlands. At around 2:20 pm on 6 August 2005, while he walked down Ben Stack in Sutherland, Cook suddenly suffered a severe heart attack, collapsed, lost consciousness and fell about down a ridge. He was assisted after his fall by another hill-walker who refused all publicity and was granted anonymity. A helicopter containing paramedics arrived 30 minutes after a 999 call was made. Cook then was flown to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.

Gaynor did not get in the helicopter and walked down the mountain. Despite efforts made by the medical team to revive Cook in the helicopter, he was already beyond recovery, and at 4:05 pm, minutes after arrival at the hospital, was pronounced dead. He was 59. Two days later, a post-mortem examination found that Cook had died of hypertensive heart disease.

A funeral was held on 12 August 2005, at St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Edinburgh, even though Cook had been an atheist. Gordon Brown gave the eulogy, and German foreign minister Joschka Fischer was one of the mourners. Tony Blair, who was on holiday at the time, did not attend.

A later memorial service at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster, on 5 December 2005, included a reading by Blair and tributes by Brown and Madeleine Albright. On 29 September 2005, Cook&#x27;s friend and election agent since 1983, Jim Devine, won the resulting by-election with a reduced majority.

In January 2007, a headstone was erected in the Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh where Cook is buried, bearing the epitaph: &quot;I may not have succeeded in halting the war, but I did secure the right of parliament to decide on war.&quot; It is a reference to Cook&#x27;s strong opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the words were reportedly chosen by his widow and two sons from his previous marriage.

in April 2022, Police Scotland were asked by an individual whose name was redacted for seven pieces of unanswered information surrounding Cook&#x27;s death. The request was initially refused, but the Scottish Information Commissioner ruled the police had breached the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 by doing so. Since this development, controversy has re-emerged around the circumstances of Cook&#x27;s death.

<text>The Cocoanut Grove fire was a nightclub fire which took place in Boston, Massachusetts, on November 28, 1942, and resulted in the deaths of 492 people. It is the deadliest nightclub fire in history and the third-deadliest single-building fire (after the September 11 attacks and Iroquois Theatre fire). The Cocoanut Grove was one of Boston&#x27;s most popular nightspots, attracting many celebrity visitors. It was owned by Barnet &quot;Barney&quot; Welansky, who was closely connected to the Mafia and to Mayor Maurice J. Tobin. Fire regulations had been flouted: some exit doors had been locked to prevent unauthorized entry, and the elaborate palm tree décor contained flammable materials. The air-conditioning used flammable gas because of the wartime shortage of Freon.

During the first Thanksgiving weekend since the U.S. had entered World War II the Grove was filled to more than twice its legal capacity. The fire was initiated by an electrical short and fueled by methyl chloride in the air conditioning unit. Flames and smoke spread rapidly through all areas of the club, and people were unable to escape efficiently because of the locked exit doors. Blame was directed at Welansky for violation of standards; he served nearly four years in jail before being released just weeks before his death. 

Local hospitals were especially well prepared to treat the casualties having been rehearsing emergency drills in response to possible wartime attacks on the East Coast. The crisis demonstrated the value of the recently installed blood banks and stimulated important advances in the treatment of burn victims. Following the fire many new laws were enacted for public establishments, including the banning of flammable decorations, a provision that emergency exits must be kept unlocked (from the inside), and that revolving doors cannot be the only exit.

==Club==
The Cocoanut Grove opened as a partnership between two orchestra leaders, Mickey Alpert and Jacques Renard, in 1927 during Prohibition at 17 Piedmont Street in the Bay Village neighborhood of Boston, spanning from Piedmont Street to Shawmut Street. It became a speakeasy as Alpert and Renard&#x27;s Mafia-connected financiers gained control, and the club had a reputation as a gangland hangout. Although neither Alpert nor Renard held an interest in the club by 1942, Alpert was leading the house band on the night of the fire.

Gangland boss and bootlegger Charles &quot;King&quot; Solomon, also known as &quot;Boston Charlie&quot;, owned the club from 1931 until he was gunned down in the men&#x27;s room of Roxbury&#x27;s Cotton Club nightclub in 1933. Ownership passed to his lawyer Barnet &quot;Barney&quot; Welansky, who sought a more mainstream image for the club while privately boasting of his ties to the mob and Boston Mayor Maurice J. Tobin. Welansky was known to be a tough boss who ran a tight ship, hiring teenagers as busboys for low wages and street toughs to double as waiters and bouncers. He locked exits, concealed others with draperies, and even bricked up one emergency exit to prevent customers from leaving without paying.

Originally a garage and warehouse complex, the brick and concrete buildings which constituted the Cocoanut Grove had been converted to a one-and-a-half-story meandering complex of dining rooms, bars, and lounges. A lounge in an adjoining building had opened the week before the fire. The club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a South Seas-like &quot;tropical paradise&quot; with a roof that could be rolled back in summer for dancing under the stars. The decor consisted of leatherette, rattan and bamboo coverings on the walls, heavy draperies, and dark blue satin canopies and covering on ceilings. Support columns in the main dining area were made to look like palm trees, with light fixtures made to look like coconuts. The theme was continued in the basement Melody Lounge, with what little light there was provided by palm tree light fixtures.

==Background==
The &quot;Grove&quot; had become one of Boston&#x27;s most popular nightspots, featuring a restaurant and dancing in the main area, floor shows, and piano-playing entertainers in the Melody Lounge. Visiting movie stars and singers would have their entry announced by the &quot;maître d&#x27;&quot;. The &quot;Caricature Bar&quot; featured renditions of the establishment&#x27;s prominent guests. The club had expanded eastward with the new Broadway Lounge, which opened onto adjacent Broadway between Piedmont Street (south side) and Shawmut Street (north side).

Wall coverings and decorative materials had been approved on the basis of tests for ordinary ignition, which showed resistance to combustion from sources such as matches and cigarettes. Decorative cloth was purportedly treated with fire retardant ammonium sulfate upon installation, but there was no documentation that the treatment was maintained at the required intervals. The air-conditioning freon refrigerant had been replaced with the flammable gas methyl chloride because of a wartime shortage.

On the day of the fire College of the Holy Cross football team beat Boston College, causing the Boston College celebration party scheduled for the Cocoanut Grove that evening to be canceled. Mayor Tobin, a Boston College fan, also canceled his plans to go to the Grove. Female impersonator Arthur Blake was a headlining act that night. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people were crammed into the space rated for a maximum of 460. On the night of the fire Welansky was recovering from a heart attack in a private room at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH).

==Fire==

Official reports state that the fire started at about 10:15 pm in the Melody Lounge. Goody Goodelle, a young pianist and singer, was performing on a revolving stage surrounded by artificial palm trees. The lounge was lit by low-powered light bulbs in coconut-styled sconces beneath the fronds. A young man, possibly a soldier, had unscrewed a light bulb in order to give himself and his date privacy while kissing. Stanley Tomaszewski, a 16-year-old busboy, was instructed to put the light back on by tightening the bulb. He stepped up onto a chair to reach the light in the darkened corner. Unable to see the bulb, he lit a match to illuminate the area, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses first saw flames in the fronds, which were just below the ceiling, immediately afterward. Though the lit match had been close to the same fronds where the fire was seen to have begun, the official report determined that Tomaszewski&#x27;s actions could not be found to be the source of the fire, which &quot;will be entered into the records of this department as being of unknown origin.&quot;

Despite waiters&#x27; efforts to douse the fire with water, it spread along the fronds of the palm tree decoration. In a final desperate attempt to separate the burning fronds from the fabric-covered false ceiling, the decoration was pulled away from the corner, taking with it a triangular plywood panel at the ceiling level and opening the enclosed space above the false ceiling. The fire then spread to the false ceiling which burned rapidly, showering patrons with sparks and burning shreds of fabric. Flames raced up the stairway to the main level, with embers landing on patrons fleeing up the stairs. A burst through the front entryway and spread through the remaining club areas: through the adjacent Caricature Bar, down a corridor to the Broadway Lounge, and across the central restaurant and dance floor as the orchestra was beginning its evening show. Flames raced faster than patrons could move, followed by thick clouds of smoke. Within five minutes, flames and smoke had spread to the entire nightclub. Some patrons were instantly overcome by smoke as they sat in their seats. Others crawled through the smoky darkness, trying to find exits, all but one of which were either non-functioning or hidden in non-public areas.

Many patrons attempted to exit through the main entrance, the same way they had entered. The building&#x27;s main entrance was a single revolving door, which was rendered useless as the crowd stampeded in panic. Bodies piled up behind both sides of the revolving door, jamming it until it broke. The oxygen-hungry fire then leaped through the breach, incinerating whoever was left alive in the pile. Firemen had to douse the flames to approach the door.

Other avenues of escape were similarly useless; side doors had been bolted shut to prevent people from leaving without paying. A plate glass window, which could have been smashed for escape, was boarded up and unusable as an emergency exit. Other unlocked doors, like the ones in the Broadway Lounge, opened inwards, rendering them useless against the crush of people trying to escape. Fire officials would later testify that had the doors swung outwards, at least 300 lives could have been spared.

From nearby bars, soldiers and sailors raced to assist. On the street, firefighters lugged out bodies and were treated for burned hands. As night deepened, the temperature dropped. Water on cobblestone pavements froze over, and hoses were fused to the ground. Newspaper trucks were appropriated as ambulances. Smoldering bodies, living and dead, were hosed in icy water. Some victims had breathed fumes so hot that when they inhaled cold air, as one firefighter put it, they dropped like stones.

Later, during the cleanup of the building, firefighters found several dead guests sitting in their seats with drinks in their hands. They had been overcome so quickly by fire and toxic smoke that they had not had time to move.

==Victims and escapees==

Boston newspapers were filled with lists of the dead and stories of narrow escapes. Well-known film actor Buck Jones was at the club that night, and his wife later explained that he had initially escaped and then gone back into the burning building to find his agent, producer Scott R. Dunlap of Monogram Pictures. However, Jones was discovered slumped under his table severely burned, so some doubted accounts of his escape. Although rushed to hospital, Jones died of his injuries two days later. Dunlap, who was hosting a party at the nightclub in honor of Jones, was seriously injured but survived.

Staff at the Cocoanut Grove fared better in escaping than customers, owing to their familiarity with service areas, where the fire&#x27;s effects were less severe than in the public areas, and which provided access to additional window and door exits. A double door opposite the public entryway to the main dining room was unlocked by wait staff and became the only functional outside exit from public areas. Although several members of the band died, including musical director Bernie Fazioli, most of them escaped backstage and through a service door that they rammed open. Alpert escaped out of a basement window and was credited with leading several people to safety. Bassist Jack Lesberg went on to play music with Louis Armstrong, Sarah Vaughan, Leonard Bernstein, and many others until shortly before his death in 2005.

Cashier Jeanette Lanzoni, entertainer Goody Goodelle, three bartenders and other employees and patrons in the Melody Lounge escaped into the kitchen. Bartender Daniel Weiss survived by dousing a cloth napkin with a pitcher of water and breathing through it as he made his escape from the Melody Lounge. Those in the kitchen had escape routes through a window above a service bar and up a stairway to another window and a service door that was eventually rammed open. Five people survived by taking refuge in a walk-in refrigerator and a few more in an icebox. Rescuers reached the kitchen after about ten minutes.

Coast Guardsman Clifford Johnson went back inside the building no fewer than four times in search of his date who, unbeknownst to him, had safely escaped. Johnson suffered extensive third-degree burns over 55% of his body but survived the disaster, becoming the most severely burned person to survive his injuries to date. After 21 months in a hospital and several hundred operations, he married his nurse and returned to his home state of Missouri. Fourteen years later he burned to death in a fiery automobile crash.

The Cocoanut Grove fire was the second-deadliest single-building fire in American history; only the 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago had a higher death toll, of 602. The Grove fire occurred only two years after the Rhythm Club fire which had killed 209.

==Investigations==
An official report revealed that the Cocoanut Grove had been inspected by a captain in the Boston Fire Department (BFD) just ten days before the fire and declared safe. Furthermore, it was found that the Grove had not obtained any licenses for operation for several years; there were no food handlers&#x27; permits and no liquor licenses. Stanley Tomaszewski, the busboy who had allegedly started the fire, was underage and should not have been working there. Moreover, the recent remodeling of the Broadway Lounge had been done without building permits, using unlicensed contractors.

Tomaszewski testified at the inquiry and was exonerated, as he was not responsible for the flammable decorations or the life safety code violations. He was nevertheless ostracized for much of his life because of the fire. Tomaszewski died in 1994.

The BFD investigated possible causes of ignition, the rapid spread of the fire and the catastrophic loss of life. Its report reached no conclusion as to the initial cause of ignition but attributed the rapid, gaseous spread of the fire to a buildup of carbon monoxide gas from oxygen-deprived combustion in the enclosed space above the false ceiling of the Melody Lounge. The gas exuded from enclosed spaces as its temperature rose and ignited rapidly as it mixed with oxygen above the entryway, up the stairway to the main floor and along ceilings. The fire accelerated as the stairway created a thermal draft, and the high-temperature gas fire ignited pyroxylin (leatherette) wall and ceiling covering in the foyer, which in turn exuded flammable gas. The report also documented the fire safety code violations, flammable materials and door designs that contributed to the large loss of life.

During the 1990s, former Boston firefighter and researcher Charles Kenney discovered that a highly flammable gas refrigerant, methyl chloride, had been used as a substitute for freon, which was in short wartime supply. Kenney reported that floor plans, but not the fire investigation report, showed air-conditioning condenser units near street level on the other side of a non-structural wall from the Melody Lounge, and that these units had been serviced since the start of the war. Kenney also reported that photographic evidence indicates an origin for the fire in the wall behind the palm tree and suggested ignition of methyl chloride accelerant by an electrical failure caused by substandard wiring. Methyl chloride combustion is consistent with some aspects of the fire (reported flame colors, smell and inhalation symptoms) but requires additional explanation for ceiling-level fire as the gas is 1.7 times as dense as air.

In 2012, the BFD released the transcripts of witness interviews following the fire. Witnesses Tomaszewski, Morris Levy, Joyce Spector, David Frechtling and Jeanette Lanzoni (Volume 1) provided accounts of the ignition of the palm decoration and ceiling in the Melody Lounge. Frechtling and Lanzoni described the start of the fire as a &quot;flash.&quot; Tomaszewski described the spread of the fire across the ceiling as like a gasoline fire. The flame front across the ceiling was faint blue, followed by brighter flames. Witness Roland Sousa (Volume 2) stated that he was initially unconcerned about the fire because, as a regular customer of the Melody Lounge, he had seen the palm tree decorations ignite before and they were always quickly put out.

==Legal consequences==

Barney Welansky, whose connections had allowed the nightclub to operate while in violation of the loose standards of the day, was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter (nineteen victims were randomly selected to represent the dead). He was sentenced to 12–15 years in prison in 1943. Welansky served nearly four years before being quietly pardoned by Tobin, who had been elected governor of Massachusetts since the fire. In December 1946, ill with cancer, Welansky was released from Norfolk Prison and told reporters, &quot;I wish I&#x27;d died with the others in the fire.&quot; He died nine weeks after his release.

In the year that followed the fire, Massachusetts and other states enacted laws for public establishments banning flammable decorations and inward-swinging exit doors, and requiring exit signs to be visible at all times (meaning that the exit signs had to have independent sources of electricity and be easily readable in even the thickest smoke). The new laws also required that revolving doors used for egress must either be flanked by at least one normal, outward-swinging door, or retrofitted to permit the individual door leaves to fold flat to permit free-flowing traffic in a panic situation, and further required that no emergency exits be chained or bolted shut in such a way as to bar escape through the doors during a panic or emergency situation. Jack Thomas of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote in his front page 50th-anniversary article &quot;the Licensing Board ruled that no Boston establishment could call itself the Cocoanut Grove.&quot; There has never been another Cocoanut Grove in Boston.

Commissions were established by several states that would levy heavy fines or even shut down establishments for infractions of any of these laws. These later became the basis for several federal fire laws and code restrictions placed on nightclubs, theaters, banks, public buildings, and restaurants across the nation. It also led to the formation of several national organizations dedicated to fire safety.

==Medical treatment==
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Boston City Hospital (BCH) received the majority (83%) of the victims from the fire; other Boston area hospitals received a total of about thirty patients: Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Beth Israel Hospital, Cambridge City Hospital, Kenmore Hospital, Faulkner Hospital, St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, Malden Hospital, Massachusetts Memorial Hospital, Carney Hospital, and St. Margaret&#x27;s Hospital. MGH took 114 burn and smoke inhalation victims, and BCH received over 300. It was estimated that one casualty arrived at BCH every eleven seconds, the greatest influx of patients to any civilian hospital in history. Both hospitals were unusually well-prepared, as medical facilities all along the eastern seaboard had drawn up emergency plans in preparation for attacks against the East Coast. Boston had carried out a city-wide drill only a week earlier, simulating a Luftwaffe bombing assault, with over 300 mock casualties. At MGH, a special store of emergency supplies had been stockpiled. The fire caught both hospitals at change of shift, so that a double complement of nursing and support staff was available, in addition to volunteers who flocked to the hospitals as word spread of the disaster.

Nonetheless, most patients died en route to the hospitals or shortly after arrival. Because no standardized system for triage yet existed in civilian mass casualty management in the U.S., precious minutes were initially wasted in attempts to revive those who were dead or dying, until teams were dispatched to select the living for treatment and direct the dead to be taken to temporary mortuaries. By Sunday morning, November 29, only 132 patients out of the 300 transported to BCH were still alive, whereas at MGH, 75 of the 114 victims had died, leaving 39 surviving patients in treatment. Of a total of 444 burn victims hospitalized after the fire, only 130 survived.

One of the first administrative decisions made at MGH was to clear the general surgery ward on the sixth floor of the White Building and devote it entirely to victims of the fire. All victims were housed there; strict medical isolation was maintained, and a part of the ward was set aside for dressing changes and wound care. Teams of nurses and orderlies were organized for administration of morphine, wound care, and respiratory treatments.

Prior to the fire, in April 1942, MGH had established one of the area&#x27;s first blood banks, and had stocked it with 200 units of dried plasma as part of preparations for the war. A total of 147 units of plasma were used in treating 29 patients at MGH. At BCH, where the Office of Civilian Defense had stored 500 units of plasma for wartime use, 98 patients received a total of 693 units of plasma, which included plasma donated by Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, the United States Navy and the American Red Cross. The volume of plasma used in treating victims of the fire surpassed that used during the attack on Pearl Harbor. In the days following the fire, 1,200 people donated over 3,800 units of blood to the blood bank.

Most survivors were discharged by the end of 1942; however, a few patients required months of intensive care. In April 1943, the last survivor from MGH was discharged. At BCH, the last casualty, a woman from Dorchester, died in May after five months of treatment for severe burns and internal injuries. Hospitals rendering service chose not to charge any of the patients for treatment. The Red Cross provided financial aid to both public and private hospitals. This was especially helpful to BCH, given its enormous influx of patients.

===Advances in the care of burn victims===

The fire led to new ways of caring for both burns and smoke inhalation. The team at BCH was directed by Dr. Charles Lund as senior surgeon and Dr. Newton Browder. In 1944, Lund and Browder, drawing upon their experiences in treating Cocoanut Grove victims, published the most widely cited paper in modern burn care, &quot;Estimation of the Areas of Burns&quot;, in which a diagram for estimating burn size are presented. This diagram, called the Lund and Browder chart, remains in use throughout the world today.

====Fluid therapy====
Surgeons Francis Daniels Moore and Oliver Cope at MGH pioneered fluid resuscitation techniques for the burn victims, noting that the majority of patients suffered from severe hemorrhagic tracheobronchitis because of &quot;prolonged inhalation of the very hot air and fumes which presumably contained many toxic products...and, in addition, numerous hot particles of fine carbon or similar substances.&quot; At the time, infusions of saline alone were thought to &quot;wash out&quot; plasma proteins and increase the risk of pulmonary edema. Accordingly, patients at MGH were given a solution of equal parts of plasma and saline solution, based on the extent of their cutaneous burns, while at BCH, patients with respiratory injuries were given fluids as needed. 

Careful evaluations showed no evidence of pulmonary edema, and Finland&#x27;s studies at BCH concluded that &quot;the fluids seemed to produce obvious improvement in most instances without any apparent adverse effect on the respiratory system.&quot; This experience stimulated further studies of burn shock, leading to a 1947 publication by Cope and Moore of the first comprehensive formula for fluid therapy based on a calculation of the total surface area of burn wounds and the volume of urine and liquids that had been wrung out of patients’ bedsheets.

====Burn care====
The standard surface burn treatment in use at the time was the so-called &quot;tanning process&quot; involving the application of a solution of tannic acid, which created a leathery scab over the wound that protected against the invasion of bacteria and prevented the loss of bodily fluids. This was a time-consuming process that subjected the patient to agonizing pain because of the scrubbing procedure required before the application of the chemical dyes.

At MGH, burns were treated with a new technique pioneered by Cope and refined by Bradford Cannon: soft gauze covered with petroleum jelly and boric acid ointment. Patients were kept on a closed ward, and meticulous sterile technique was used in all patient care activities. A month later, at BCH 40 of the initial 132 survivors had died, mostly from complications from their burns; at MGH none of the 39 initial survivors died from their burns (seven died from other causes). As a result, the use of tannic acid as a treatment for burns was phased out as the standard.

====Antibiotics====
At MGH, intravenous sulfadiazine (a drug which had only been approved for use in the U.S. in 1941) was given to all patients as part of their initial treatment. At BCH, 76 patients received sulfonamides for an average of 11 days. Thirteen survivors of the fire were also among the first humans to be treated with penicillin. In early December Merck and Company rushed a 32-liter supply of the drug in the form of culture liquid in which the &quot;Penicillium&quot; mold had been grown, from Rahway, New Jersey, to Boston. These patients received 5,000 IU (roughly 2.99 mg) every four hours, a small dose by today&#x27;s standards, but at the time antibiotic resistance was rare, and most strains of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; were penicillin-sensitive. The drug was crucial in preventing infections in skin grafts. According to the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;:

Though bacteriological studies showed that most of the burns were infected, the second-degree burns healed without clinical evidence of infection and with minimal scarring. The deep burns remained unusually free of invasive infection.

As a result of the success of penicillin in preventing infections, the U.S. government decided to support the production and the distribution of penicillin to the armed forces.

====Psychological trauma====
Erich Lindemann, an MGH psychiatrist, studied the survivors of the dead and published what has become a classic paper, &quot;Symptomatology and Management of Acute Grief&quot;, read at the Centenary Meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in 1944.

At the same time Lindemann was laying the foundation for the study of grief and dysfunctional grieving, Alexandra Adler conducted psychiatric observations and questionnaires over eleven months with more than 500 survivors of the fire, publishing some of the earliest research on post-traumatic stress disorder. More than half of the survivors exhibited symptoms of general nervousness and anxiety which lasted at least three months. Survivors who lost consciousness for a short period of time during the incident exhibited the most post-traumatic mental complications. Adler noted that 54% of survivors treated at BCH and 44% of those at MGH exhibited &quot;post-traumatic neuroses&quot;, and that a majority of the survivors&#x27; friends and family members showed signs of &quot;emotional upset that attained proportions of a major psychiatric condition and needed trained intervention.&quot; Adler also discovered one survivor with a lasting brain lesion who presented symptoms of visual agnosia, most likely caused by exposure to carbon monoxide fumes, other noxious gases and/or a lack of sufficient oxygen.

==Former site and memorial==

After the Cocoanut Grove complex was torn down in 1944, the street map of the vicinity changed by urban renewal, with nearby streets being renamed or built over. The nightclub address was 17 Piedmont Street, in the Bay Village neighborhood near downtown Boston. For decades after the fire, this address was used as a parking lot. Much of the club&#x27;s former footprint, including what was the main entrance, now lies under the Revere Hotel; only a portion of the club extended out to Shawmut Street. The surviving section of Shawmut Street, and a newer extension cutting through what was the club&#x27;s original footprint, formerly known as Shawmut Street Extension, were renamed Cocoanut Grove Lane in 2013. In 2015, several condominium residences were constructed on the site and designated as 25 Piedmont Street.

In 1993, the Bay Village Neighborhood Association installed a memorial plaque in the sidewalk—crafted by Anthony P. Marra, youngest survivor of the Cocoanut Grove fire—next to the location where the club formerly stood:
In memory of the more than 490 people who died in the Cocoanut Grove fire on November 28, 1942. As a result of that terrible tragedy, major changes were made in the fire codes, and improvements in the treatment of burn victims, not only in Boston but across the nation. &quot;Phoenix out of the Ashes&quot;
The plaque has been moved several times to some controversy. A committee was formed to build a more substantial memorial.

On November 26, 2023, groundbreaking was held in Boston&#x27;s Statler Park, near Piedmont Street, for an memorial, scheduled to be completed by September 2024. It will contain 492 granite bricks, each with a victim&#x27;s name inscribed.

<text>Zond () was the name given to two distinct series of Soviet robotic spacecraft launched between 1964 and 1970. The first series, based on the 3MV planetary probe, was intended to gather information about nearby planets.

The second series of test spacecraft was intended as a precursor to remote-controlled robotic circumlunar loop flights, using a stripped-down variant of Soyuz spacecraft, consisting of the service and descent modules, but lacking the orbital module.

Two tortoises and other lifeforms aboard Zond 5 were the first terrestrial organisms to travel around the Moon and return to Earth.

==Missions based on the 3MV planetary probe==


The first three missions were based on the model 3MV planetary probe, intended to explore Venus and Mars. After two failures, Zond 3 was sent on a test mission, becoming the second spacecraft to photograph the far side of the Moon (after Luna 3). It then continued out to the orbit of Mars in order to test telemetry and spacecraft systems.

==Circumlunar missions==
The missions Zond 4 through Zond 8 were test flights for the Soviet Moonshot during the Moon race. The Soyuz 7K-L1 (also mentioned just as L1) spacecraft was used for the Moon-aimed missions, stripped down to make it possible to launch around the Moon from the Earth. They were launched on the Proton rocket which was just powerful enough to send the Zond on a free return trajectory around the Moon without going into lunar orbit (the same kind of path flown by Apollo 13 in its emergency abort). With minor modification, Zond was capable of carrying two cosmonauts.

In the beginning, there were serious reliability problems with both the new Proton rocket and the similarly new Soyuz spacecraft, but the test flights pressed ahead with some glitches. The majority of test flights from 1967 to 1970 (Zond 4 to Zond 8) showed problems during re-entry.

The Zond spacecraft made only uncrewed automatic flights. Four of these suffered malfunctions that would have injured or killed any crew. Instrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on micrometeor flux, solar and cosmic rays, magnetic fields, radio emissions, and solar wind. Many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown.

<text>Zond 3 was a 1965 space probe which performed a flyby of the Moon far side, taking 28 quality photographs. It was a member of the Soviet Zond program while also being part of the Mars 3MV project. It was unrelated to Zond spacecraft designed for crewed circumlunar missions (Soyuz 7K-L1). It is believed that Zond 3 was initially designed as a companion spacecraft to Zond 2 to be launched to Mars during the 1964 launch window. The opportunity to launch was missed, and the spacecraft was launched on a Mars-crossing trajectory as a spacecraft test, even though Mars was no longer attainable.

==Spacecraft design==
The spacecraft was of the 3MV-4 type, similar to Zond 2. In addition to a 106.4 mm focal length imaging system for visible light photography and ultraviolet spectrometry at 285-355 μm, it carried ultraviolet (190-275 μm) and infrared (3-4 μm) spectrophotometers, radiation sensors (gas-discharge and scintillation counters), charged particle detector, magnetometer, and micrometeoroid detector. It also had an experimental ion engine.

==Operational history==
Zond 3 was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on July 18, 1965, at 14:38 UTC, and was deployed from a Tyazhely Sputnik (65-056B) Earth-orbiting platform towards the Moon and interplanetary space. This was a repeat of a mission that failed in late 1963 intended to test communication at distances equivalent to the distances experienced by Mars and Earth.

Zond 3&#x27;s lunar flyby occurred on July 20 with a closest approach of , approximately after launch. 25 visible light photographs and 3 ultraviolet spectra of very good quality were taken of the lunar surface, beginning at 01:24 UTC and prior to closest approach and ending at 02:32 UTC and past closest approach, covering a period of 68 minutes. The photos covered of the lunar surface.

Zond 3 proceeded on a trajectory across Mars&#x27; orbit, but not at a time when planetary encounter would occur. These images were transmitted by radio frequency on July 29 at a distance of . To test telemetry, the camera film was rewound and retransmitted in mid-August, mid-September, and finally on October 23 at a distance of , thus proving the ability of the communications system. The subsequent transmissions were also at progressively slower data rates but higher quality. The mission was ended after radio contact ceased on March 3, 1966, when it was at a distance of . It operated for 228 days, roughly equivalent to the time needed to survive a journey to Mars and exceeding that needed for Venus.

==Legacy==
In 1967, the second part of the &quot;Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon&quot; was published in Moscow, based on data from Zond 3, with the catalog now including 4,000 newly discovered features of the lunar far side landscape. In the same year, the first &quot;Complete Map of the Moon&quot; (1: scale) and updated complete globe (1: scale), featuring 95 percent of the lunar surface, were released in the Soviet Union.

<text>Zond 5 () was a spacecraft of the Soviet Zond program. In September 1968 it became the first spaceship to travel to and circle the Moon in a circumlunar trajectory, the first Moon mission to include animals, and the first to return safely to Earth. Zond 5 carried the first terrestrial organisms to the vicinity of the Moon, including two Russian tortoises, fruit fly eggs, and plants. The tortoises underwent biological changes during the flight, but it was concluded that the changes were primarily due to starvation and that they were little affected by space travel.

The Zond spacecraft was a version of the Soyuz 7K-L1 crewed lunar-flyby spacecraft. It was launched by a Proton-K carrier rocket with a Block D upper-stage to conduct scientific studies during its lunar flyby.

==Background==
Out of the first four circumlunar missions launched by the Soviet Union there was one partial success, Zond 4, and three failures. After &#x27;s mission in March 1968, a follow-up, Zond 1968A, was launched on 23 April. The launch failed when an erroneous abort command shut down the Proton rocket&#x27;s second stage. The escape rocket fired and pulled the descent module to safety. In July, Zond 1968B was being prepared for launch when the second-stage rocket exploded on the launchpad, killing three people, but leaving the Proton first-stage booster rocket and the spacecraft itself with only minor damage.

The mission was originally planned to fly cosmonauts around the Moon, but the failures of and led the Soviets to send an uncrewed mission instead, from fear of the negative propaganda of an unsuccessful crewed flight.

== Payload ==

Two Russian tortoises (&quot;Agrionemys horsfieldii&quot;) were included in the biological payload, weighing each pre-flight. Along with the tortoises, insects and micro-organisms were part of the crew. Soviet scientists chose tortoises since they were easy to tightly secure. There were also two tortoises used as control specimens and four more in a vivarium. Twelve days before launch, the two space-bound tortoises were secured in the vehicle and deprived of food and water; the control tortoises were similarly deprived. The food deprivation was a part of pathomorphological and histochemical experiments. The biological payload also included fruit fly eggs, cells of wheat, barley, pea, pine, carrots and tomatoes, specimens of the wildflower species &quot;Tradescantia paludosa&quot;, three strains of the single-celled green algae &quot;Chlorella&quot;, and one strain of lysogenic bacteria. The purpose of sending a variety of terrestrial lifeforms was to test the effect of cosmic radiation on them. However, the test subjects were not analogous to humans, because the choice of life forms were all extremophiles with a substantially higher radioresistance. The Russian Academy of Sciences stated that a mannequin equipped with radiation sensors occupied the pilot&#x27;s seat.

Kazan Optical and Mechanical Plant had developed the AFA-BA/40 imager, which was installed on the spacecraft, giving it the ability to image the Earth. also contained proton detectors. could transmit some of its data back to ground stations, although data stored onboard and collected after return to Earth has less noise.

==Mission==
=== Launch and trajectory ===
 launched on 14 September 1968 at 21:42.10UTC, from Site 81 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The thrust of the third-stage rocket was terminated at , which was the start of a 251-second coast. , the upper-stage rocket, ignited and burned for 108 seconds, placing the spacecraft into a parking orbit of . Fifty-six minutes into the parking orbit the fired a final time for the trans-lunar injection. After this maneuver, the launch was announced to the world. Mission Control discovered a problem with &#x27;s attitude and traced the cause to a contaminated star tracker. Heat caused some of the interior coating to outgas, which delayed an attitude correction on the way to the Moon. The maneuver was performed from Earth using the Sun and the Earth as reference points.

On 18 September, the spacecraft flew around the Moon, although it did not orbit it. The closest distance was . On the way back from the Moon, another star tracker failed. The spacecraft also erroneously switched off the guided reentry system. Eight ships were deployed to the Indian Ocean prior to launch, as a precaution in case the spacecraft could not reach Soviet territory; only three of them had rescue helicopters on board.

=== Reentry and recovery ===

On 21 September, the reentry capsule entered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The primary landing zone was in Kazakhstan, but instead splashed down in the Indian Ocean and was recovered by the Soviet vessels &quot;Borovichy&quot; (Боровичи) and &quot;Vasiliy Golovnin&quot; (Василий Головнин). It landed at −32°38&#x27; latitude and 65°33&#x27; longitude, from the nearest Soviet naval ship. The landing occurred at night, which impaired recovery efforts.

 became the first spacecraft to circle the Moon and return to Earth. The entire journey took 6days, 18hours and 24minutes. The biological specimens were safely recovered. shadowed the Soviet recovery ships, collecting intelligence, but left shortly after the spacecraft was brought on board the Soviet ship.

==Results and future plans==

High-quality photographs of the Earth, the first photos of their kind, were taken at a distance of . British astronomer Bernard Lovell, considered to be Britain&#x27;s top space expert, said that the mission showed that the Soviets were ahead in the Space Race. The British Interplanetary Society believed that the USSR would be able to send cosmonauts around the Moon within a matter of months.

In October 1968, sources in the U.S. claimed the mission was not as successful as the Soviets advertised. The mission had been intended to fly closer to the Moon, and its actual distance did not allow for useful lunar photography. They also said that the angle at which the spacecraft reentered the atmosphere was too steep for a cosmonaut to survive. The sources indicated that the spacecraft landed in the Indian Ocean when the planned location was in Soviet territory, which was a factor in the recovery taking ten hours.

The official Soviet news agency, TASS, announced in November 1968 that the flight carried living animals. The tortoises were dissected on 11 October after fasting for 39days. The flying tortoises, identified as and , had lost 10% of their body weight during the trip, but showed no loss of appetite. The control tortoises lost 5% of their weight. Comparison of analyses of blood from the space-travelling tortoises and the control specimens revealed no differences. Another analysis showed the flying tortoises had elevated iron and glycogen levels in their liver and that the flight also affected the internal structures of their spleens. The authors concluded that the changes in the flight tortoises were primarily due to starvation, with the space travel having little effect. In November 1968, it was announced that the spacecraft was planned as a precursor to a crewed lunar spacecraft. The Soviets made this announcement a month before the planned Apollo 8 flight, in an attempt to show they were close to being able to carry out a crewed trip to the Moon.

== Cosmonaut crew communications test and hoax ==
The Zond 5 caused a scare in the United States when on 19 September 1968, the voices of cosmonauts Valery Bykovsky, Vitaly Sevastyanov and Pavel Popovich were transmitted from the spacecraft and intercepted by Jodrell Bank Observatory and the CIA. The cosmonauts were apparently reading out telemetry data and computer readings, and even discussing making an attempt to land. At the height of the Cold War, there was a real concern that the Soviets might actually beat NASA to the Moon. Apollo 17 astronaut Eugene Cernan remarked that the incident had &quot;shocked the hell out of us.&quot;

Popovich would later recall: &quot;When we realized we would never make it to the moon, we decided to engage in a little bit of hooliganism. We asked our engineers to link the on-the-probe receiver to the transmitter with a jumper wire. Moon flight missions were then controlled from a command centre in Yevpatoria, in the Crimea. When the probe was on its path round the Moon, I was at the center. So I took the mic and said: &quot;The flight is proceeding according to normal; we’re approaching the surface...&quot; Seconds later my report – as if from outer space – was received on Earth, including [by] the Americans. The U.S. space advisor Frank Borman got a phone call from President Nixon [actually Johnson], who asked: &#x27;Why is Popovich reporting from the moon?&#x27; My joke caused real turmoil. In about a month&#x27;s time. Frank came to the USSR, and I was instructed to meet him at the airport. Hardly had he walked out of his plane when he shook his fist at me and said: &#x27;Hey, you, space hooligan!&#x27;&quot;

== Location ==

The capsule is on display at the RKK Energiya museum, located in Moscow Oblast, Russia.

It was launched on a lunar flyby mission on November 10, 1968, from a parent satellite (68-101B) in Earth parking orbit. The spacecraft carried a biological payload of turtles, flies, and bacteria. It also carried scientific probes including cosmic ray, micrometeoroid detectors, and photographic equipment.

The mission was a precursor to a crewed circumlunar flight which the Soviets hoped could occur in December 1968, thus beating the American Apollo 8. However, after rounding the Moon on November 14, Zond 6 crashed on its return to Earth, due to a parachute failure when the parachute was detached from the capsule too early.

==Mission==
Zond 6 was the official designation for Soyuz 7K-L1 s/n 12. It was supposed to photograph the Moon in colour and in black and white, from 8,000 km and 2,600 km ranges, then return to Earth, landing at Tyuratam, only 16 km from the launch pad. It had been a long and difficult road to develop the L1 guidance system, but it worked perfectly that time.

Zond 6 flew around the Moon on 14 November 1968, at a minimum distance of 2,420 km. Photographs of the lunar near side and far side were obtained with panchromatic film. Each photo was . Some of the views allowed for stereo pictures. The photos were taken from distances of approximately 11,000 km and 3,300 km.

The flight was tracked by Jodrell Bank Observatory, which picked up telemetry data and voice transmissions. The telemetry data appear to have been simulated sensor readings; the voices were either from a tape recorder or being relayed through the probe. In 2018, a recording of the signals was found in Jodrell Bank&#x27;s archive.

During the craft&#x27;s return from the Moon, concerns arose about the falling temperatures of the hydrogen peroxide tanks. This issue was addressed by rotating Zond 6 so that the tanks were in direct sunlight. While this was successful in raising the temperatures of the tanks, it also damaged the seal around the door of the re-entry cabin, resulting in the spacecraft starting to leak and the pressure in the cabin falling.

Zond 6 used a relatively uncommon technique called &quot;skip reentry&quot; to shed velocity upon returning to Earth. A few hours before reentry, on 17 November 1968, the cabin largely depressurised, killing all the animal test subjects aboard. A further problem resulted in Zond 6&#x27;s parachutes ejecting while the cabin was still several miles up. The craft crashed in Kazakhstan, near the designated landing area.

Investigation of the remains of the spacecraft was delayed while the self-destruct system was located and removed. The craft&#x27;s film magazines could then be recovered, and the images therein were published, along with claims that the mission had been entirely successful.

A State Commission investigating the crash later determined that the coronal discharge effect which caused the parachute to jettison would only occur at the capsule pressure. If the capsule had been completely depressurised to a high vacuum, the accident would not have occurred.

<text>The Zond 7 spacecraft, part of the Soviet Zond program, was launched towards the Moon on a Proton-K D rocket on August 7, 1969. Its mission was to support studies of the Moon and circumlunar space, to obtain color photography of Earth and the Moon from varying distances, and to flight test the spacecraft systems. It was an unpiloted version of the Soyuz 7K-L1, a crewed Moon-flyby spacecraft.

Earth photos were obtained on August 9, 1969. On August 11, 1969, the spacecraft flew past the Moon at a distance of 1984.6 km and conducted two picture taking sessions. On its way back from the Moon the spacecraft tested its radio systems by transmitting recorded voices.

Zond 7 carried four turtles, a follow-up to the September 1968 Zond 5 mission which carried two tortoises on a circumlunar lunar mission, and the November 1968 Zond 6 mission which also carried turtles.

A human-like tissue-equivalent phantom for radiation measurements was placed aboard. The phantom was equipped with 20 channels for radiation detectors (thermoluminescent glasses and nuclear photoemulsions) distributed along the whole body for measurement of doses in critical organs. The doses accumulated during the flight through the radiation belts and around the Moon were between 0.2 and 0.7 rad in different points at the depth of 3 g/cm2 from the body surface.

Like other Zond circumlunar craft, Zond 7 used a relatively uncommon technique called skip reentry to shed velocity upon returning to Earth.
Of all circumlunar Soviet Zond craft launches, Zond 7 would have been the first to make a safe flight for a cosmonaut had it been crewed.

Zond 7 reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on August 14, 1969, and achieved a soft landing in a preset region south of Kustanai, Kazakhstan. 
The return capsule is on display at the Dmitrov Facility of Bauman University in Orevo, Russia.

<text>Zond 8, also known as L-1 No.14, was the last in the series of circumlunar spacecraft, a member of the Soviet Zond program, designed to rehearse a piloted circumlunar flight, an uncrewed version of Soyuz 7K-L1 crewed circumlunar flight spacecraft. The project was initiated in 1965 to compete with the Americans in the race to the Moon but lost its importance once three astronauts orbited the Moon on the Apollo 8 mission in December 1968.

==Mission==
Zond 8 was launched on 20 October 1970, at 19:55:39 GMT by a Proton-K / Blok D launcher from Site 81/23 of the Baikonur Cosmodrome, towards the Moon. Zond 8 had a mass of . The announced objectives of Zond 8 were investigations of the Moon and circumlunar space and testing of onboard systems and units.

The spacecraft obtained photographs of Earth on 21 October from a distance of . After a mid-course correction on 22 October 1970 at a distance of from Earth. The spacecraft transmitted flight images of Earth for three days. Zond 8 reached the Moon without any apparent problems, circling its target on 24 October at a range of and took both black-and-white and color photographs of the lunar surface during two separate sessions. The minimum distance from the Moon during the mission was 1,120 kilometres (696 miles) from the lunar surface. Scientific measurements were also obtained during the flight.

After two mid-course corrections on the return leg, Zond 8 achieved a return trajectory over Earth&#x27;s northern hemisphere instead of the standard southern approach profile, allowing Soviet ground control stations to maintain near-continuous contact with the craft. The guidance system, however, malfunctioned on the return leg, and the spacecraft performed a simple ballistic (instead of a guided) reentry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The reentry was different from other reentries in the Zond program as it went over the north pole and landed in the Indian Ocean.

Zond 8 descent module reentered the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and splashed down safely in the Indian Ocean at 13:55 GMT on 27 October 1970 at southeast of the Chagos Islands, from its original target point. The USSR recovery ship &quot;Taman&quot; was on hand to collect it and bring it back to Moscow.

The Soviet Kremlin officials finally decided to cancel the L1 project in 1970.

<text>A micrometeoroid is a tiny meteoroid: a small particle of rock in space, usually weighing less than a gram. A micrometeorite is such a particle that survives passage through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and reaches Earth&#x27;s surface.

The term &quot;micrometeoroid&quot; was officially deprecated by the IAU in 2017, as redundant to meteoroid.

== Origins and orbits ==
Micrometeoroids are very small pieces of rock or metal broken off from larger chunks of rock and debris often dating back to the birth of the Solar System. Micrometeoroids are extremely common in space. Tiny particles are a major contributor to space weathering processes. When they hit the surface of the Moon, or any airless body (Mercury, the asteroids, etc.), the resulting melting and vaporization causes darkening and other optical changes in the regolith. 

Micrometeoroids have less stable orbits than meteoroids, due to their greater surface area to mass ratio. Micrometeoroids that fall to Earth can provide information on millimeter scale heating events in the solar nebula. Meteorites and micrometeorites (as they are known upon arrival at the Earth&#x27;s surface) can only be collected in areas where there is no terrestrial sedimentation, typically polar regions. Ice is collected and then melted and filtered so the micrometeorites can be extracted under a microscope. 

Sufficiently small micrometeoroids avoid significant heating on entry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Collection of such particles by high-flying aircraft began in the 1970s, since which time these samples of stratosphere-collected interplanetary dust (called &quot;Brownlee particles&quot; before their extraterrestrial origin was confirmed) have become an important component of the extraterrestrial materials available for study in laboratories on Earth.

== Historical studies ==
In 1946 during the Giacobinid meteor shower, Helmut Landsberg collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower. Fred Whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere. Instead, they quickly decelerated and then fell to Earth unmelted. In order to classify these sorts of objects, he coined the term &quot;micro-meteorite&quot;.

===Velocities===
Whipple, in collaboration with Fletcher Watson of the Harvard Observatory, led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen. At the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known. Direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors, demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from comet tails, and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin. Today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the Solar System, consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material, like comets.

===Flux===
The early studies were based exclusively on optical measurements. In 1957, Hans Pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on Earth, estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year. This suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations. Such a high flux presented a very serious risk to the high-orbiting Apollo capsules and for missions to the Moon. To determine whether the direct measurement was accurate, a number of additional studies followed, including the Pegasus satellite program, Lunar Orbiter 1, Luna 3, Mars 1 and Pioneer 5. These showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere, or flux, was in line with the optical measurements, at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year. The Surveyor Program determined that the surface of the Moon is relatively rocky. Most lunar samples returned during the Apollo Program have micrometeorite impacts marks, typically called &quot;zap pits&quot;, on their upper surfaces.

== Effect on spacecraft operations ==
Micrometeoroids pose a significant threat to space exploration. The average velocity of micrometeoroids relative to a spacecraft in orbit is 10 kilometers per second (22,500 mph). Resistance to micrometeoroid impact is a significant design challenge for spacecraft and space suit designers (&quot;See Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment&quot;). While the tiny sizes of most micrometeoroids limits the damage incurred, the high velocity impacts will constantly degrade the outer casing of spacecraft in a manner analogous to sandblasting. Long term exposure can threaten the functionality of spacecraft systems.

Impacts by small objects with extremely high velocity (10 kilometers per second) are a current area of research in terminal ballistics (although accelerating objects up to such velocities is difficult; current techniques include linear motors and shaped charges). The risk is especially high for objects in space for long periods of time, such as satellites. They also pose major engineering challenges in theoretical low-cost lift systems such as rotovators, space elevators, and orbital airships.

=== Spacecraft micrometeoroid shielding ===
Whipple&#x27;s work pre-dated the Space Race and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later. His studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote. However, a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites, about the size of dust grains.

Whipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946. Originally known as a &quot;meteor bumper&quot; and now termed the Whipple shield, this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecraft&#x27;s body. When a micrometeoroid strikes the foil, it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads. By the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft, it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below. The shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity, while the foil adds little additional weight. Such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.

For spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit, some variety of the Whipple shield has been almost universal for decades. Later research showed that ceramic fibre woven shields offer better protection to hypervelocity (~7 km/s) particles than aluminium shields of equal weight. Another modern design uses multi-layer flexible fabric, as in NASA&#x27;s design for its never-flown TransHab expandable space habitation module, and the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which was launched in April 2016 and attached to the ISS for two years of orbital testing.

<doc id="186824" wikidata="Q1501447" url="?curid=186824" title="Black legend">
<text>The Black Legend () or the Spanish Black Legend () is a purported historiographical tendency which consists of anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic propaganda. Its proponents argue that its roots date back to the 16th century, when Spain&#x27;s European rivals were seeking, by political and psychological means, to demonize the Spanish Empire, its people, and its culture, minimize Spanish discoveries and achievements, and counter its influence and power in world affairs.

According to the theory, Protestant propaganda published during the Hispano-Dutch War and the Anglo-Spanish War against the Catholic monarchs of the 16th century fostered an anti-Hispanic bias among subsequent historians. Along with a distorted view of the history of Spain and the history of Latin America, other parts of the world in the Portuguese Empire were also affected as a result of the Iberian Union and the Luso-Dutch Wars. Although this 17th-century propaganda was based in real events from the Spanish colonization of the Americas, which involved atrocities, the theory of the &quot;Leyenda Negra&quot; suggests that it often employed lurid and exaggerated depictions of violence, and ignored similar behavior by other powers.

Wars provoked by the religious schism and the formation of new states in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries also generated a propaganda war against the then–Spanish Empire, bastion of the Catholic Church. As such, the assimilation of originally Dutch and English 16th-century propaganda into mainstream history is thought to have fostered an anti-Hispanic bias against the Catholic monarchs among later historians, along with a distorted view of the history of Spain, Latin America, and other parts of the world.

Although most scholars agree that while the term Black Legend might be useful to describe 17th and 18th century anti-Spanish propaganda, there is no consensus on whether the phenomenon persists in the present day. A number of authors have critiqued the use of the &quot;black legend&quot; idea in modern times to present an uncritical image of the Spanish Empire&#x27;s colonial practices (the so called &quot;white legend&quot;).

==Historiography and definitions of the Spanish Black Legend==
The term &quot;black legend&quot; was first used by Arthur Lévy in reference to biographies of Napoleon, and he primarily used it in the context of two opposing legends, a &quot;golden legend&quot; and a &quot;black legend&quot;: two extreme, simplistic, one-dimensional approaches to a character which portrayed him as a god or a demon. &quot;Golden&quot; and &quot;black legends&quot; had been used by Spanish historians and intellectuals with the same meaning in reference to aspects of Spanish history; Antonio Soler used both terms about the portrayal of Castilian and Aragonese monarchs. The use of the term &quot;leyenda negra&quot; to refer specifically to a biased, anti-Spanish depiction of history gained currency in the first two decades of the 20th century, and is most associated with Julián Juderías. Throughout the 20th and into the 21st century, scholars have offered divergent interpretations of the Black Legend and debated its usefulness as a historical concept.

===Origins of the concept of a Spanish Black Legend===
At an 18 April 1899 Paris conference, Emilia Pardo Bazán used the term &quot;Black Legend&quot; for the first time to refer to a general view of modern Spanish history:

The conference had a great impact in Spain, particularly on Julián Juderías. Juderías, who worked at the Spanish Embassy in Russia, had noticed (and denounced) the spread of anti-Russian propaganda in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom and was interested in its possible long-term consequences. Juderías was the first historian to describe the &quot;black legend&quot; phenomenon, although he did not yet name it as such, in a book regarding the construction of an anti-Russian black legend. His work, initially concerned with the intentional deformation of Russia&#x27;s image in Europe, led him to identify the same patterns of narration he detected in the construction of anti-Russian discourse in the dominant historical narrative regarding Spain. Juderías investigated the original sources supporting centuries old claims of Spanish atrocities and other misdeeds, tracing the origin or propagation of the majority to rival emerging powers. In his 1914 book, &quot;La leyenda negra y la verdad histórica&quot; (&quot;The Black Legend and Historical Truth&quot;), deconstructs aspects of Spain&#x27;s image (including those in &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;). According to Juderías, this biased historiography was marked by acceptance of propagandistic and politically motivated historical sources and has consistently presented Spanish history in a negative light, purposefully ignoring Spanish achievements and advances. In &quot;La leyenda Negra&quot;, he defines the Spanish black legend as:

===Historiographic development of the term===

Later writers supported and developed Juderías&#x27;s critique. In &quot;Tree of Hate&quot; (1971), Historian Charles Gibson described it as &quot;the accumulated tradition of propaganda and hispanophobia according to which the Spanish Empire is considered cruel, intolerant, degenerate, exploitative and sanctimonious above reality.&quot;

Historian Philip Wayne Powell argued that the Black Legend was still active in modern history, and plays an active role in shaping Latin America–United States relations. His book provides examples of what he viewed as divergent treatment of Spain and other powers, and illustrates how this allows for a double narrative that taints Americans&#x27; view of Hispanic America as a whole:

In his book &quot;Inquisition&quot;, Edward Peters wrote:
In his 2002 book &quot;Spain in America: The Origins of Hispanism in the United States&quot;, American historian Richard Kagan defined the Spanish black legend: 
According to Julián Marías, the creation of the Spanish black legend was not an exceptional phenomenon -similar disinformation and fabrication campaigns have affected most global powers of the past, such as Ottoman Turkey or Russia- but its persistence and integration into mainstream historiography is. For Marías the causes of its durability are:
#Overlap of the Spanish Empire with the introduction of the printing press in England and Germany, which enabled the printing of hundreds of pamphlets daily
#Religious factors and identification
#Substitution of the Spanish intellectual class by another favorable to its former rival (France) after the War of the Spanish Succession, which established a French narrative in Spain 
#The unique characteristics of the early modern era&#x27;s colonial wars and the need for new colonial powers to legitimize claims in now-independent Spanish colonies and the unique, new characteristics of the succeeding empire: the British Empire.

Walter Mignolo and Margaret Greer view the Black Legend as a development of Spain&#x27;s racialisation of Jewishness in the 15th century. The accusations of mixed blood and loose religiosity of the 15th century, first levelled at Jewish and Moorish conversos both inside Spain and abroad, developed into 16th century hispanophobic views of Spaniards as religious fanatics tainted by association with Judaism. The only stable element they see in this hispanophobia is an element of &quot;otherness&quot; marked by interaction with the Eastern and African worlds, of &quot;complete others&quot;, cruelty and lack of moral character, in which the same narratives are re-imagined and reshaped.

Antonio Espino López suggests that the prominence of the Black Legend in Spanish historiography has meant that the real atrocities and brutal violence of the Spanish conquest of the Americas have not received the attention they deserve within Spain. He believes that some Hispanicists:

According to historian Elvira Roca Barea, the formation of a black legend and its assimilation by a nation is a phenomenon observed in all multicultural empires (not just the Spanish Empire). For Roca Barea, a black legend about an empire is the cumulative result of the propaganda attacks launched by different groups: smaller rivals, allies within its political sphere and defeated rivals, and propaganda created by rival factions inside the imperial system; alongside self-criticism by the intellectual elite, and the needs of new powers consolidated during (or after) the empire&#x27;s existence.

In response to Roca Barea, José Luis Villacañas states that the &quot;black legend&quot; was primarily a factor related to the geopolitical situation of the 16th and 17th centuries. He argues that: 

The conceptual validity of a Spanish black legend is widely but not universally accepted by academics. Benjamin Keen expressed doubt about its usefulness as a historical concept, while Ricardo García Cárcel and Lourdes Mateo Bretos denied its existence in their 1991 book, &quot;The Black Legend&quot;:

==Historical basis==
Despite having a vast empire stretching from Mexico to Peru across the Pacific to the Philippines and beyond, which required many Spaniards to travel overseas and deal with foreigners, eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, &quot;The Spaniard&#x27;s bad side is that he does not learn from foreigners; that he does not travel in order to get acquainted with other nations; that he is centuries behind in the sciences. He resists any reform; he is proud of not having to work; he is of a romantic quality of spirit, as the bullfight shows; he is cruel, as the former auto-da-fé shows; and he displays in his taste an origin that is partly non-European.&quot; Thus, semiotician Walter Mignolo argues that the Spanish black legend was closely tied to race in using Spain&#x27;s Moorish history to portray Spaniards as racially tainted and its treatment of Africans and Native Americans during Spanish colonization to symbolize the country&#x27;s moral character. That notwithstanding, there is general agreement that the wave of anti-Spanish propaganda of the 16th and 17th centuries was linked to undisputed events and phenomena which occurred at the apogee of Spanish power between 1492 and 1648.

===Conquest of the Americas===
During the three-century European colonization of the Americas, atrocities and crimes were committed by all European nations according to both contemporary opinion and modern moral standards. Spain&#x27;s colonization involved genocide, massacres, murders, slavery, sexual slavery, torture, rape, forced removals, forced religious conversion, cultural genocide and other atrocities, especially in the early years, following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Caribbean. However, Spain was the first in recorded history to pass laws for the protection of indigenous peoples. As early as 1512, the Laws of Burgos attempted to regulate the behavior of Europeans in the New World forbidding the ill-treatment of indigenous people and limiting the power of &quot;encomenderos&quot;—landowners who received royal grants to indigenous communities and their labor. In return, the laws established a regulated regime of work, provisioning, living quarters, hygiene, and care for the natives. The regulation prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the landowners and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish. The laws also ordered that the natives be taught the Christian religion and outlawed bigamy.

In July 1513, four more laws were added in what is known as Leyes Complementarias de Valladolid 1513, three related to Indian women and Indian children and another more related to Indian males. In 1542 the New Laws expanded, amended and corrected the previous body of laws in order to ensure their application. These New Laws represented an effort to prevent abuse and de facto enslavement of natives that was not enough to dissuade rebellions by the , like that of Gonzalo Pizarro in Perú. However, this body of legislation represents one of the earliest examples of humanitarian laws of modern history.
Although these laws were not always followed, they reflect the conscience of the 16th century Spanish monarchy about native rights and well-being, and its will to protect the inhabitants of Spain&#x27;s territories. These laws came about in the early period of colonization, following abuses reported by Spaniards themselves traveling with Columbus. Spanish colonization methods included the forceful conversion of indigenous populations to Christianity. The &quot;Orders to the Twelve&quot; Franciscan friars in 1523, urged that the natives be converted using military force if necessary. On par with this sentiment, Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda argued that the Indian&#x27;s inferiority justified using war to civilize and Christianize them. He encouraged enslavement and violence in order to end the barbarism of the natives. Bartolomé de las Casas, on the other hand, was strictly opposed to this viewpoint—claiming that the natives could be peacefully converted.

Such reports of Spanish abuses led to an institutional debate in Spain about the colonization process and the rights and protection of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas published &quot;Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias&quot; (&quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot;), a 1542 account of the alleged atrocities committed by landowners and officials during the early period of colonization of New Spain (particularly on Hispaniola). In his &quot;Short Account&quot;, de las Casas underscores the innocence of the indigenous peoples while comparing the Spanish conquistadors to &quot;ravening wild beasts, wolves, tigers, or lions that had been starved for many days.&quot; De las Casas, son of the merchant Pedro de las Casas (who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage), described Columbus&#x27;s treatment of the natives in his &quot;History of the Indies&quot;. His description of Spanish actions was used as a basis for attacks on Spain, including in Flanders during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The accuracy of de las Casas&#x27;s descriptions of Spanish colonization is still debated by some scholars due to supposed exaggerations. Although historian Lewis Hanke thought that de las Casas exaggerated atrocities in his accounts, Benjamin Keen found them more or less accurate. Charles Gibson&#x27;s 1964 monograph &quot;The Aztecs under Spanish Rule&quot; (the first comprehensive study of sources about relations between Indians and Spaniards in New Spain), concludes that the demonization of Spain &quot;builds upon the record of deliberate sadism. It flourishes in an atmosphere of indignation which removes the issue from the category of objective understanding. It is insufficient in its understanding of institutions of colonial history.&quot; However this view has been broadly criticised by other scholars such as Keen, who view Gibson&#x27;s focus on legal codes rather than the copious documentary evidence of Spanish atrocities and abuses as problematic.

In 1550, Charles I tried to end this debate by halting forceful conquest. Philip II tried to follow in his footsteps with the Philippine Islands, but previous violent conquest had shaped colonial relations irreversibly. This was one of the lasting consequences that led to the dissemination of the Black legend by Spain&#x27;s enemies.

The treatment of indigenous peoples during Spanish colonization was used in propaganda works of rival European powers in order to foster animosity towards the Spanish Empire. De las Casas&#x27; work was first cited in English in the 1583 work , at a time when England was preparing to join the Dutch Revolt on the side of the anti-Spanish rebels.

Historians have noted that the mistreatment and exploitation of indigenous peoples was committed by all European powers which colonized the Americas, and such acts were never exclusive to the Spanish Empire. The revaluation of the Black Legend on contemporary historiography has led to a reassessment of non-Spanish European colonial records in recent years as the historiographical evaluation of the Impact of Western European colonialism and colonisation continues to evolve. According to scholar William B. Maltby, &quot;At least three generations of scholarship have produced a more balanced appreciation of Spanish conduct in both the Old World and the New, while the dismal records of other imperial powers have received a more objective appraisal.&quot;

=== War with the Netherlands ===
Spain&#x27;s war with the United Provinces and, in particular, the victories and atrocities of the Castilian nobleman Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, contributed to anti-Spanish sentiment. Sent in August 1567 to counter political unrest in a part of Europe where printing presses encouraged a variety of opinions (especially against the Catholic Church), Alba seized control of the publishing industry; several printers were banished, and at least one was executed. Booksellers and printers were prosecuted and arrested for publishing banned books, many of which were part of the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;.

After years of unrest in the Low Countries, the summer of 1567 saw renewed violence in which Dutch Calvinists defaced statues and decorations in Catholic monasteries and churches. The March 1567 Battle of Oosterweel was the first Spanish military response to the unrest, and the beginning of the Eighty Years&#x27; War. In 1568 Alba had prominent Dutch nobles executed in Brussels&#x27; central square, sparking anti-Spanish sentiment. In October 1572, after Orange forces captured the city of Mechelen, its lieutenant attempted to surrender when he heard that a larger Spanish army was approaching. Despite efforts to placate the troops, Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo (son of the governor of the Netherlands and commander of the duke&#x27;s troops) allowed his men three days to pillage the city; Alba reported to King Philip II that &quot;not a nail was left in the wall&quot;. A year later, magistrates were still attempting to retrieve church artifacts which Spanish soldiers had sold elsewhere.

This sack of Mechelen was the first of a series of events known as the Spanish Fury; several others occurred over the next several years. In November and December 1572, with the duke&#x27;s permission, Fadrique had residents of Zutphen and Naarden locked in churches and burnt to death. In July 1573, after a six-month siege, the city of Haarlem surrendered. The garrison&#x27;s men (except for the German soldiers) were drowned or had their throats cut by the duke&#x27;s troops, and eminent citizens were executed. More than 10,000 Haarlemers were killed on the ramparts, nearly 2,000 burned or tortured, and double that number drowned in the river. After numerous complaints to the Spanish court, Philip II decided to change policy and relieve the Duke of Alba. Alba boasted that he had burned or executed 18,600 persons in the Netherlands, in addition to the far greater number he massacred during the war, many of them women and children; 8,000 persons were burned or hanged in one year, and the total number of Alba&#x27;s Flemish victims can not have fallen short of 50,000.
The Dutch Revolt spread to the south in the mid-1570s after the Army of Flanders mutinied for lack of pay and went on the rampage in several cities, most notably Antwerp in 1576. Soldiers rampaged through the city, killing, looting, extorting money from residents and burning the homes of those who did not pay. Christophe Plantin&#x27;s printing establishment was threatened with destruction three times, but was spared each time with payment of a ransom. Antwerp was economically devastated by the attack; 1,000 buildings were torched, and as many as 17,000 civilians were raped, tortured and murdered. Parents were tortured in their children&#x27;s presence, infants were slain in their mother&#x27;s arms, wives were flogged to death before their husbands&#x27; eyes. Maastricht was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice by the &quot;Tercios de Flandes&quot; (in 1576 and 1579), and the 1579 siege ended with a Spanish Fury which killed 10,000 men, women and children. Spanish troops who breached the city walls first raped the women, then massacred the population, reputedly tearing people limb from limb. The soldiers drowned hundreds of civilians by throwing them off the bridge over the river Maas in an episode similar to earlier events in Zutphen. Military terror defeated the Flemish movement, and restored Spanish rule in Belgium.

The propaganda created by the Dutch Revolt during the struggle against the Spanish Crown can also be seen as part of the Black Legend. The depredations against the Indians that De las Casas had described were compared to the depredations of Alba and his successors in the Netherlands. The &quot;Brevissima relación&quot; was reprinted no less than 33 times between 1578 and 1648 in the Netherlands (more than in all other European countries combined). The &quot;Articles and Resolutions of the Spanish Inquisition to Invade and Impede the Netherlands&quot; accused the Holy Office of a conspiracy to starve the Dutch population and exterminate its leading nobles, &quot;as the Spanish had done in the Indies.&quot; Marnix of Sint-Aldegonde, a prominent propagandist for the cause of the rebels, regularly used references to alleged intentions on the part of Spain to &quot;colonize&quot; the Netherlands, for instance in his 1578 address to the German Diet.

In recent years, Prof. dr. Maarten Larmuseau of KU Leuven has used genetic testing to examine a prevalent belief regarding the Spanish occupation

The memory of the large scale rape of local women by Spanish soldiers lives on to such extent that it is popularly believed that their genetic imprint can be seen today, and that most men and women with dark hair in the area descend from children conceived during those rapes. The study found no greater Iberian genetic component in the areas occupied by the Spanish army than in surrounding areas of northern France, and concluded that the genetic impact of the Spanish occupation, if any, must have been too small to survive until the present era. However, the study makes it clear that the absence of a Spanish genetic imprint in modern populations was not incompatible with the occurrence of mass sexual violence. The frequent murder of Flemish rape victims by Spanish soldiers, the fact rape does not always lead to fertilisation, and the reduced survival possibilities of the illegitimate offspring of rape victims would all militate against significant Iberian genetic contribution to modern populations. Larmuseau considers the persistence of the belief in a Spanish genetic contribution in Flanders to be the fruit of the use of Black Legend tropes in the construction of Dutch and Flemish national identities in the 16th–19th century, giving prominence to the idea of the Spanish armies&#x27; cruelty in collective memory.

In an interview with a local newspaper, Larmuseau compared the persistence in popular memory of the actions of the Spanish with the lesser attention given to the Austrians, the French and the Germans who also occupied the Low Countries and participated in violence against their inhabitants.

==Regional perspectives==
===Italy===
Sverker Arnoldsson of the University of Gothenburg supports Juderías&#x27; hypothesis of a Spanish black legend in European historiography and identifies its origins in medieval Italy, unlike previous authors (who date it to the 16th century). In his book &quot;The Black Legend: A Study of its Origins&quot;, Arnoldsson cites studies by Benedetto Croce and Arturo Farinelli to assert that Italy was hostile to Spain during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries when the Crown of Aragon occupied most of Italy and texts produced and distributed there were later used as a base by Protestant nations.

Liberal historians such as Benedetto Croce see in the Il Risorgimento process the conclusion of the unifying trend that began with the Italian Renaissance, which suffered a long interruption between the middle of the 16th century and the beginning of the 18th century that coincided with direct domination by the Hispanic Monarchy over half of Italy and indirectly over part of the other half. Croce&#x27;s statements about the Italian aristocracy and their responsibility for the decline of Italy, published in 1917, when the country was in the middle of the world war, aroused reactions, accusations and even indignation on the part of historians, writers, intellectuals and politicians and &quot;...the controversy...&quot; writes a well-known contemporary Spanish historian &quot;...it has not yet died out, but there are many historians who today accept, at least in part, Croce&#x27;s arguments.&quot;

The vision of some Italian historians continues to identify the Spanish domination of Italy with a period of decadence for the country, due, in part, to the action of the Inquisition (the traditional religious court, not to be confused with the Spanish institution, which operated with different criteria). Authors such as Campanella or Giordano Bruno suffered persecution for religious reasons, as had also happened at the end of the fifteenth century and in the Florence of Savonarola. The identification of the occupier with oppression was part of the widely spread anti-Spanish propaganda known as the black legend, whose artistic products include Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (set in 17th-century Milan) or Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;. According to one interpretation of the Risorgimento, the historical period of Spanish misrule in Milan had been chosen by Manzoni with the intention of alluding to the same oppressive rule of Austrian rule over northern Italy. Other literary critics believe instead that what Manzoni wanted to describe was the Italian society of all times, with all its defects that have remained over time.

Arnoldsson&#x27;s theory on the origins of Spain&#x27;s black legend has been criticized as conflating the process of black-legend generation with a negative view (or critique) of a foreign power. The following objections have been raised:
# The Italian origin of the earliest writings against Spain is an insufficient reason to identify Italy as the origin of the black legend; it is a normal reaction in any society dominated by a foreign power. 
# The phrase &quot;black legend&quot; suggests a tradition (non-existent in Italian writings) based on a reaction to the recent presence of Spanish troops (which quickly faded).
# In 15th- and 16th-century Italy, critics and Italian intellectual admirers of Spain (particularly Ferdinand II of Aragon) coexisted.

Edward Peters states in his work &quot;Inquisition&quot;:According to William S. Maltby, Italian writings lack a &quot;conducting theme&quot;: a common narrative which would form the Spanish black legend in the Netherlands and England. Roca Barea agrees; although she does not deny that Italian writings may have been used by German rivals, the original Italian writings &quot;lack the viciousness and blind deformation of black-legend writings&quot; and are merely reactions to occupation.

===Germany===
Arnoldsson offered an alternative to the Italian-origin theory in its polar opposite: the German Renaissance. German humanism, deeply nationalistic, wanted to create a German identity in opposition to that of the Roman invaders. Ulrich of Hutten and Martin Luther, the main authors of the movement, used &quot;Roman&quot; in the broader concept &quot;Latin&quot;. The Latin world, which included Spain, Portugal, France, and Italy, was perceived as &quot;foreign, immoral, chaotic and fake, in opposition to the moral, ordered and German.&quot;

In addition to the identification of Spaniards with Jews, heretics, and &quot;Africans&quot;, there was an increase in anti-Spanish propaganda by detractors of Emperor Charles V. The propaganda against Charles was nationalistic, identifying him with Spain and Rome although he was born in Flanders, spoke Dutch but little Spanish and no Italian at the time, and was often at odds with the pope.

To further the appeal of their cause, rulers opposed to Charles focused on identifying him with the pope (a view Charles had encouraged to force Spanish troops to accept involvement in his German wars, which they had resisted). The fact that troops and supporters of Charles included German and Protestant princes and soldiers was an extra reason to reject the Spanish elements attached to them. It was necessary to instill fear of Spanish rule, and a certain image had to be created. Among published points most often highlighted were the identification of Spaniards with Moors and Jews (due to the frequency of intermarriage), the number of &quot;conversos&quot; (Jews or Muslims who converted to Christianity) in their society, and the &quot;natural cruelty of those two.&quot;

=== England/ Britain ===

Spanish statesman Antonio Pérez del Hierro, who served as the secretary to Philip II of Spain before fleeing to France and then England after being arrested, wrote &quot;Pedacos de Historia o Relaciones&quot;, which was published in London by English printer Richard Field in 1594. The work, which was read widely in England, heavily denounced the Spanish monarchy and further contributed to pre-existing anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiments among the English. A violently hispanophobic preacher and pamphleteer, Thomas Scott, would echo this sort of epithet a generation later, in the 1620s, when he urged England to go to war against &quot;those wolvish Antichristians&quot; instead of accepting the Spanish match.

William S. Maltby, regarding Spain in the Netherlands, said that:

===Sephardic Jews===

According to Philip Wayne Powell, the criticism which was spread by the Jews who were expelled by Spain&#x27;s Catholic monarchs was an important factor in the spread of anti-Spanish sentiment (particularly religious stereotypes). Powell places the beginning of the criticism of the Jewish populations against Spain in 1480, with the creation of the Spanish Inquisition, which was directed mainly against crypto-Jews and false converts. But it was from the expulsion of 1492 that this opinion became general. Despite the fact that they had previously been expelled from almost all European countries, in no other had they had such deep roots during the Middle Ages, coming to live what has been called a Golden Age, giving special relevance to this expulsion. The persecution of Jews, crypto-Jews, Muslims and converts was viewed favorably in the rest of Europe and even applauded in the case of &quot;a country so mixed with Jews and Moors&quot; like Spain.

Studies by Kaplan, Yerushalmi, Mechoulan and Jaime Contreras show that many expelled Jewish intellectuals collaborated in spreading the negative image of Spain. The largest Sephardic community was in Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, with two synagogues. His activity, &quot;little affected to the service of his Majesty&quot;, came to provoke the protest of the Spanish ambassadors before the archduke in Brussels. Especially hated was the Inquisition, considered the &quot;fourth beast spoken of by the prophet Daniel&quot;, a denatured justification, an accumulation of evil, which had corrupted society. Criticism spread to Flanders and Venice, where Sephardim had also settled. Thus, the communities publicized the executions of the Inquisition, such as the one that occurred in 1655 in Córdoba.

The Sephardim were grateful to their new homeland during the Eighty Years&#x27; War: just as Spain was a &quot;land of idolatry&quot; and slavery, like Egypt, whose rulers suffer the curse of Yahweh; The Netherlands, on the other hand, is the land of freedom, on which the God of Israel will bring down all the blessings, as Daniel Levi de Barrios or Menasseh Ben Israel (previously called Manoel Soeiro) wrote. They also used their power within the publishing industry, both to support the Dutch in their struggle and to spread criticism of Spain.

===Islamophobia and antisemitism===
According to Elvira Roca Barea, the Spanish Black Legend is a variant of the antisemitic narratives which had already been circulated in medieval-era Northern, Central and Southern European nations since the 13th century, critical of the perceived tolerance of Jews and heretics in Spain. In 1555, after the expulsion of the Spanish Jews, Pope Paul IV described Spaniards as &quot;heretics, schismatics, accursed of God, the offspring of Jews and Moors, the very scum of the earth&quot;. This climate would facilitate the transfer of antisemitic and anti-Muslim stereotypes to Spaniards. This case has three main sources of proof, the texts of German Renascence Intellectuals, the existence of the black legend narrative in Europe prior to the conquest of America, and the similarity of the stereotypes to other stereotypes which were attributed to Judaism by anti-Semitic Europeans and the stereotypes which the Black Legend attributed to the Spanish.

Martin Luther correlated &quot;the Jew&quot; (who was detested in Germany at the time) with &quot;the Spanish&quot;, whose power was increasing in the region. According to Sverker Arnoldsson, Luther:
*Identified Italy and Spain with the papacy, even though the Pontifical States and Spain were enemies at the time 
*Ignored the coexistence (including intermarriage) of Christians and Jews in Spain
*Conflated Spain and Turkey out of fear of an invasion by either power.

In 1566, Luther&#x27;s conversations were published. Among many other similar affirmations, he is quoted as saying: 
== Distribution ==
Proponents such as Powell, Mignolo and Roca Barea allege that the Spanish Black Legend prevails in most of Europe, especially Protestant nations and France, and the Americas. There is, however, no significant trace of it in the Muslim world or Turkey despite the almost seven centuries of sustained warfare in which Spain and the Islamic world were engaged. Historian Walter Mignolo has argued that the Black Legend was closely tied to ideologies of race, both in the way that it used the Moorish history of Spain to depict Spaniards as racially tainted, and in the way that the treatment of Africans and Native Americans during Spanish colonial projects came to symbolize their moral character.

=== America ===
The first Puritan settlers were deeply hostile to Spain, seeing themselves as the Protestant advance guard that would free the Indians from Spanish oppression and cruelty. Prominent among these Puritan authors was Cotton Mather, who translated the Bible into Spanish for distribution among the Indians of New Spain. After its independence, the United States soon became a territorial rival of Spain in America, both on the border with New Spain, and in Florida, the Mississippi or in New Orleans, a port that the Americans wanted to export their products from. The enlightened and liberal ideas that had entered the United States in the eighteenth century, joined their sympathies for the new republics emerging to the south, increasing anti-Spanish sentiment. This hostility reached its zenith during the Spanish-American War, when the propaganda machine of Hearst and Pulitzer, used by their newspaper empires, had an enormous influence on public opinion in their country. The hispanophobic speeches heard in Congress during the conflict were so insulting that they led to massive protests in Spain.

The tensions in Hispanic America between the upper classes of creoles and , that is, the Spaniards from the Iberian Peninsula, predate the independence of the Latin American countries. It was a confrontation for the right to control and exploit the riches of the American lands and peoples and that, in general, did not affect the lower classes. Around 1800, the ideas of the Enlightenment, with its anticlericalism, its skepticism to authorities, and its support by Masonic lodges, had been enthusiastically embraced among American intellectuals. According to Powell, these ideas were mixed with the black legend, that is, with the identification of Spain as a &quot;horrible example&quot; of obscurantism and backwardness, as an enemy of modernity. Indeed, he claims that the American wars of independence were to some degree civil wars, with the rebels led by minorities of Creoles.

With this background, Powell argues that the rebels were able to use the black legend as a propaganda weapon against the metropolis. Countless manifestos and proclamations were published quoting and praising Las Casas, poems and hymns describing the depraved nature of the &quot;Spaniards&quot;, letters and pamphlets designed to advance the patriotic cause. One of the first was the Peruvian Juan Pablo Vizcardo y Guzmán in his &quot;Carta dirigida a los españoles americanos por uno de sus compatriotas&quot;, accusing the metropolis of the serious exploitation suffered, summarizing the situation as «ingratitude, injustice, servitude and desolation». Another example is one of the great heroes of American independence, Simón Bolívar, an admirer of Las Casas, whose texts he would use profusely, blamed the Spanish for all the sins committed in America (by Creoles and non-Creoles) in the last 200 years, making the Creoles the victims, the &quot;colonized&quot;. He would also be one of the first to appeal for the theft of American wealth and claim its return.

This anti-Spanish mentality was maintained during the 19th century and part of the 20th among the liberal elites, who considered &quot;de-Hispanization&quot; the solution to national problems. The historian Powell affirms that as a consequence of denigrating Spanish culture, it has been possible to denigrate their own, of which the first is a part, both in their own eyes and in foreign eyes. In addition, the fact would have produced a certain lack of roots among the American peoples, by rejecting part of their own.

=== Europe ===
At the same time, on the beginning of the 19th century, a school of liberal historians appeared in Spain and France who began to speak of the Spanish decline, considering the Inquisition responsible for this economic and cultural decline and for all the ills that afflicted the country. Other European historians would take up the subject later, maintaining this position in some authors until today. The reasoning stated that the expulsion of the Jews and the persecution of the converts would have led to the impoverishment and decline of Spain, in addition to the destruction of the middle class. In 1867 Joaquín Costa had also raised the issue of Spanish decline. Both he and Lucas Mallada wondered if the fact was due to the Spanish character. He was joined by French and Italian sociologists, anthropologists and criminologists, who spoke more of &quot;degeneration&quot; than decadence, and later other Spaniards such as Rafael Salillas or Ángel Pulido. Pompeu Gener blamed Spanish decadence on religious intolerance and Juan Valera on Spanish pride. These ideas passed into literature with the Generation of &#x27;98, in texts by Pío Baroja, Azorín and Antonio Machado: «[Castilla...] a piece of the planet crossed by the wandering shadow of Caín»; reaching in some extremes to masochism and the inferiority complex. Joseph Pérez relates this rejection of one part of his own history (the expulsion of the Jews, the Inquisition, the conquest of America) and the idealization of another (Al-Andalus) with similar movements in Portugal and France.

Also, after the Unification of Italy, many Italian historians tended to narrate in a negative way the time when part of the Italian peninsula had formed a dynastic union with Spain. In particular, Gabriele Pepe denounced what in his eyes had been the plunder and corruption of southern Italy &quot;under the Spanish&quot;. This view only began to change in the last third of the 20th century, thanks to a series of congresses and authors such as Rosario Villari and Elena Fasano Guarini. The works of Alessandro Manzoni and Giuseppe Verdi also propagated anti-Spanish propaganda on Italian literature.

=== Southeast Asia ===
The period of Spanish rule in the Philippines is often presented negatively in the present day. Although the Philippine Islands were occupied by both Spain and the United States and the Empire of Japan, only the Spaniards were considered as the oppressors who kept the society in feudal backwardness, along with the development of a servile mentality and the cause of the ignorance through religious fanaticism, while the Americans were portrayed as liberators of the nation in the process of building a national identity against the interference of other powers (the Spanish Catholics and the Islamic sultanates), who, with their defects, were able to bring Modernization in the Islands with its liberal policies. A lot of investigators mention that United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands has an important role in the construction of anti-Spanish propaganda on Philippines&#x27; education. The anti-Spanish propaganda has endured in historiography to this day, since scholars used to copy from the same standard books that have distorted the images of the Philippines with such tropes of the black legend. That being the case, it has been denounced that &quot;official&quot; historiography in the Philippines, from the nationalist and liberal school, has lacked objectivity by assuming long-repeated misconceptions regarding the early modern history of the Philippines.

According to Phillip Powell, the leading historians of the United States in the 19th century, Francis Parkman, George Bancroft, William H. Prescott, and John Lothrop Motley, would also write History tinged with the black legend, texts that remain important in later American historiography. An example of this is &quot;The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898&quot;, important source of Philippine history for non-Spanish speakers that has been criticized by modern historians, notably Glòria Cano, for deliberately distorting the original Spanish documents to portray the Captaincy General of the Philippines in a negative light. In addition, after the United States Occupation of the Philippines, the Schurman Commission was carried out, with the purpose of preparing the conditions for the government of the Philippine islands, and in which the Philippine upper class of the Principalía and the Ilustrado intellectuals participated. Thus, Jacob Schurman built and shaped a discourse that emphasized a negative view of the Philippine Republic (while declaring that the Filipinos are not ready for independence) and outlined an obscurantist image of the Spanish regime, for which they appealed typical dichotomies between modernity vs. tradition, where the Spanish regime represented an apparent medieval and reactionary backwardness, while the US administration presented itself as liberal and progressive.

Thus, the Americans in the Philippines developed a narrative with they belittled Spain, following the traditional lines of the Black Legend, as a feudal, exploitative and oppressive power, while also praising the Hispanic legacy in the Filipino (on a more social than political level), especially their conversion of &quot;savages&quot; to Christianity, but at the cost of underestimating Filipino customs (many of Hispanic origin by Catholic tradition, which the Americans considered a mistake for the Spanish to seek to achieve cultural syncretism with the barbaric and pagan). American works such as &quot;The Philippine Islands, 1493–1898&quot;, by Blair and Robertson, or &quot;The Americans in the Philippines&quot;, by James LeRoy, have been accused of having presented a caricatural image of Spanish history in the islands, as well as giving an erroneous image of the Catholic Church and its power as opposed to any possibility of social reforms in the Philippines. The US administration invoked negative views of Spanish colonialism to legitimize its occupation of the islands during the next decades, as a benevolent, modern and democratic colonization against a tyrannical and backward malevolent colonizer who had not been able to develop a national identity to the Filipinos.

== Modern era ==
Historians disagree on whether the Black Legend exists as a genuine factor in current discourse around Spain and its history. In recent years a group of historians including Alfredo Alvar, Ricardo García Cárcel and Lourdes Mateo Bretos have argued that the Black Legend does not currently exist beyond Spanish society&#x27;s own perception of how the world views Spain&#x27;s legacy. According to Carmen Iglesias, the Black Legend consists of negative traits which the Spanish people see in themselves and is shaped by political propaganda.

The view of the group around García Cárcel is echoed by Benjamin Keen, writing in 1969. He argues that the concept of the Black Legend cannot be considered valid, given that the negative depiction of Spanish behavior in the Americas was largely accurate. He further claims that whether a concerted campaign of anti-Spanish propaganda based on imperial rivalry ever existed is at least open to question.

Henry Kamen argues that the Black Legend existed during the 16th century but has disappeared in contemporary perceptions of Spain. However, other authors, like Elvira Roca Barea, Tony Horowitz and Philip Wayne Powell, have argued that it still affects the manner in which Spain is perceived, and that it is brought up strategically during diplomatic conflicts of interest as well as in popular culture to draw attention away from the negative actions of other nations. Historian John Tate Lanning argued that the most detrimental impact of the Black Legend was to reduce the Spanish colonization of the Americas (and the resulting culture that emerged) to &quot;three centuries of theocracy, obscurantism, and barbarism.&quot; In 2006, Tony Horowitz argued in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the Spanish Black Legend affected current U.S. immigration policy.

The Venezuelan case has been studied by Gilberto Ramón Quintero Lugo in his book «La Leyenda Negra y su influjo en la historiografía venezolana de la Independencia» (April 2004).

In her 2016 book exploring “empire-phobia” as a recurring sociopolitical phenomenon in human history, Elvira Roca Barea argues that the unique persistence of the Spanish Black Legend beyond the end of the Spanish Empire is tied to a continued anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic sentiment in traditionally Protestant European countries:

José Luis Villacañas, in his 2019 response to Roca Barea, labels her work as &quot;populist national-Catholic propaganda&quot; and accuses her of minimising Spanish atrocities in the Americas along with those of the Inquisition. He argues that, for all intents and purposes, the Black Legend has no meaning outside the context of 17th century propaganda, although he recognises that certain negative stereotypes of Spain may have persisted during the Franco regime.

García Cárcel criticises Roca Barea&#x27;s position as adding to a long tradition of Spanish society&#x27;s insecurities about how other countries perceive it. On the other hand, he also criticizes Villacañas&#x27;s discourse as being heavily ideological in the opposite direction and systematically indulging in presentism. García Cárcel calls for an analysis of Spain&#x27;s history that renounces both “narcissism and masochism” in favor of nuanced awareness of its “lights and shadows”.

Other proponents of the continuity theory include musicologist Judith Etzion and Roberto Fernandez Retamar, and Samuel Amago who, in his essay &quot;Why Spaniards Make Good Bad Guys&quot; analyzes the persistence of the legend in contemporary European cinema.

==White legend==

The label &quot;White Legend&quot; (&quot;Leyenda blanca&quot;) or the &quot;Pink legend&quot; (Sp: &quot;Leyenda rosa&quot;) is used to describe a historiographic approach which presents an uncritical or idealized image of Spanish colonial practices. Some authors consider this to be the result of taking attempts to counter the bias of the Black Legend too far, whereas others consider it to have developed independently. Miguel Molina Martinez describes this legend as a characteristic of the Nationalist Spanish historiography which was propagated during the regime of Francisco Franco, a regime which associated itself with the imperial past and couched it in positive terms. Molina Martinez points to the classic text of Spanish Americanists during the Franco period, Rómulo Carbia&#x27;s &quot;Historia de la leyenda negra hispanoamericana&quot;, as a work with a strong ideological motivation which frequently fell into arguments which could be qualified as part of the White Legend, while also giving more current examples of the trope. Some, such as Benjamin Keen, have criticized the works of John Fiske and Lewis Hanke as going too far towards idealizing Spanish history. While recognising the general merit of Hanke&#x27;s work, Keen suggests that the United States&#x27; contemporary imperial ventures in the Caribbean and the Philippines had led him to idealise the Spanish Empire as an analogy for American colonialism. Both Keen and Sergio Villalobos and co-workers argues that the proponents of the White Legend focus on Spanish legal codes protecting the Indigenous population, while ignoring the copious documentary evidence that they were widely ignored. Villalobos and co-workers posits that the encomienda was largelly a bad deal for indigenous peoples and marred with abuses and criticize attempts by historians like Jaime Eyzaguirre to find anecdotes of a good treatment towards the indigenous peoples. Another trope commonly repeated among proponents of the white legend is that Spanish America was never a colony after the 1951 essay &quot;Las Indias no eran colonias&quot; of Ricardo Levene. Followers of this view therefore avoid the term &quot;colony&quot; (&quot;colonia&quot;) preferring &quot;kingdom&quot; (&quot;reino&quot;) for Spanish entities in the Americas. Reportedly, this view ignores the unequal treatment of Spanish possessions in the Americas in favour of metropolitan Spain. 

Luis Castellvi Laukamp accuses Elvira Roca Barea of &quot;transforming the Black Legend into the White Legend&quot; in her influential 2016 work, &quot;Imperofobia y Leyenda Negra&quot;, in which she claims that Spain confronted the &quot;other&quot; &quot;not with racist theories but with [protective] laws&quot;. Castellvi Laukamp points out that not only did the Spanish Laws of the Indies include racism from the beginning, but slavery continued in Spanish colonies in the Americas until 1886. He further takes issue with claims that Spanish colonies&#x27; high level of mestizaje (biological and cultural mixing of the European and Indigenous population) demonstrates the absence of racism in the Spanish Empire. Castellvi Laukamp quotes from contemporary sources showing that Indigenous women were treated as spoils of war and subject to racialised sexual slavery and subordination and demonstrates the discriminatory racial stereotypes deployed against black and other non-white women in the colonial period.

Dominican Historian Esteban Mira Caballos argues that the Black and White legends form part of a single unity, which he calls a &quot;Great Lie&quot;. He goes on to describe the way the Black Legend is instrumentalised to support the White Legend:

The &quot;White Legend&quot; or the &quot;Pink Legend&quot; (Sp: &quot;Leyenda Rosa&quot;) may also refer to the propaganda which was circulated within Spain by Philip II and his descendants, propaganda which claimed that his actions in the Netherlands and America were religiously motivated, so his own patrimony would be preserved. This propaganda was intended to foster the image that Spain was ruled by a prudent and pious monarch, and control the unrest that was generated by his aggressive policies and his wars in the Netherlands.

<text>Awake is the second studio album by American rock band Godsmack, released on October 31, 2000. It features the song &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot;, which first appeared on the band&#x27;s first studio recording, &quot;All Wound Up&quot;. It is the final Godsmack album to fully include drummer Tommy Stewart, who would be replaced by current drummer Shannon Larkin afterwards. 

During the 2000s, the songs &quot;Sick of Life&quot; and &quot;Awake&quot; were used for the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;Accelerate Your Life&quot; recruiting advertisements.

==Recording==
The band opted to convert a warehouse in Haverhill, Massachusetts into a makeshift studio, rather than use a more traditional studio setting. According to Sully Erna, the band just did not want to move into any luxurious studio, because they wanted to keep the edge on for writing and &quot;not get too far away from what we&#x27;re all about&quot;. So they just stayed in the slums rather than moving into luxury.

Erna says the results show in the music&#x27;s &quot;tougher&quot; sound; &quot;however, it has a very raw edge to it. It&#x27;s not very polished,&quot; he says. &quot;But it still has a lot of good grooves, and it still has a lot of power.&quot;

The band also kept in touch with its roots by working some older unreleased material. The album includes older songs that just missed being on the debut. &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot; is a track from the original &quot;Godsmack&quot; album that was dropped in favor of &quot;Whatever&quot; for the major-label release. The songs &quot;Bad Magick&quot; and &quot;Vampires&quot; also date back to the same period.

==Release==
&quot;Awake&quot; debuted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 256,000 copies in its first week, and the album would go on to sell at least 2,000,000 copies in the United States.

Since its release, the album&#x27;s title track dominated rock radio and broke chart records throughout 2000 and 2001. The album&#x27;s spoken word track &quot;Vampires&quot; earned the band its first Grammy nomination. In 2001, &quot;Awake&quot; won the Boston Music Award for Album of the Year. &quot;Greed&quot; earned the band Boston Music Awards nominations for single and video of the year.

<doc id="186829" wikidata="Q592558" url="?curid=186829" title="Godsmack (album)">
<text>Godsmack is the major label debut album by American rock band Godsmack. It was released by Republic Records and Universal Records on August 25, 1998. The album&#x27;s recording was initially paid for by the band, at a cost of $2,600, at New Alliance Studios in Boston, and released through the band&#x27;s own record label E. K. Records Company under the title &quot;All Wound Up...&quot; in February 1997.&quot;&quot; When the band was signed to Republic/Universal in June 1998, &quot;All Wound Up...&quot; was partly edited and remixed, fully remastered at Sterling Sound in New York, and given a new artwork and layout before being re-released.&quot;&quot;

The album was certified Gold on April 13, 1999, and Platinum on June 15, 1999, the latter only nine days after it was controversially banned from several leading chain stores due to questionable lyrics and imagery. A Parental Advisory sticker was quickly added before the album resumed distribution, ultimately reaching 5× Platinum on November 20, 2024.

== Background ==
The album differs from &quot;All Wound Up...&quot; by splitting the song &quot;Get Up, Get Out!&quot; into two tracks (the intro portion being re-titled &quot;Someone in London&quot;). &quot;Whatever&quot;, which was recorded in February 1998 as a separate single and was added as a bonus track to later pressings of &quot;All Wound Up...&quot;, was edited into the album itself and served as the lead single after the reissue. The band had originally planned to keep &quot;Whatever&quot; for its next album (which later took shape as &quot;Awake&quot;), but included it on &quot;Godsmack&quot;.&quot;&quot; An entire sample lifted from the 1995 film &quot;Murder In The First&quot;, was removed from the ending of &quot;Moon Baby&quot; because actor Gary Oldman would not grant permission of its use.&quot;&quot; Another sample was also removed from the intro of &quot;Bad Religion&quot;.&quot;&quot;

The song &quot;Going Down&quot; was removed from the main edition of &quot;Godsmack&quot;, though it was included as a bonus track on the Japanese edition. It was later re-recorded for the band&#x27;s second major album &quot;Awake&quot;, under the slightly modified title &quot;Goin&#x27; Down&quot;. Another song recorded at the same time as &quot;Whatever&quot; in February 1998, &quot;Bad Magik&quot;, was only included as a Japanese bonus track on &quot;Godsmack&quot;, and was also later re-recorded for &quot;Awake&quot;, with the slightly modified title &quot;Bad Magick&quot;.&quot;&quot;

Other minor changes were made to songs&#x27; beginning and end fades during the remastering.&quot;&quot; &quot;All Wound Up...&quot; was originally mastered by Jonathan Wyner at M-Works in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but &quot;Godsmack&quot; was remastered by Joseph M. Palmaccio at Sterling Sound in New York City. Erna played drums on all of the songs, except &quot;Whatever&quot; which featured Joe D&#x27;Arco. Nevertheless, Tommy Stewart is credited as drummer in the liner notes.

==Reception==

After playing the Boston area over the following two years, local radio stations WAAF, WBCN WFNX began playing the singles &quot;Keep Away&quot; and &quot;Whatever&quot;, both of which helped the band to sell copies of their self-financed album &quot;All Wound Up&quot;. After the demand for their album became too high, Republic Records/Universal Records stepped in and signed the band to their label in 1998. The band replaced drummer Joe D&#x27;Arco with Tommy Stewart and &quot;All Wound Up&quot; was remastered and released six weeks later as &quot;Godsmack&quot;.

On November 20, 2024, the album was certified 5× Platinum by the RIAA.

Loudwire named &quot;Godsmack&quot; as one of the top 10 hard rock albums of 1998.

In 1999, the album won a Boston Music Award for Debut Album of the Year.

==Controversy==
The album caused controversy due to its profane lyrics, and liner notes containing a Wiccan pentagram and reference to &quot;Salem witches&quot;, minus a Parental Advisory warning label. After listening to his son&#x27;s copy of the album, a father in the U.S. complained to Walmart, who sold him the album, that the lyrics were offensive. Walmart and Kmart took the album off the shelves. The band and its record label later added a Parental Advisory sticker to the album, and some stores ordered amended copies of the album. Erna commented on the situation to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, stating, &quot;Our record has been in the marketplace for more than a year now without a parental advisory sticker and this is the one and only complaint. Stickers and lyrics are by nature subjective. We have decided to put a sticker on the record.&quot; This controversy did not hurt album sales, but according to Erna, helped, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s almost taunting kids to go out and get the record to see what we&#x27;re saying on it.&quot;

<doc id="186832" wikidata="Q538274" url="?curid=186832" title="Faceless (Godsmack album)">
<text>Faceless is the third studio album by American rock band Godsmack. It&#x27;s the first album to feature drummer Shannon Larkin, former drummer for Ugly Kid Joe. The album was released on April 8, 2003.

The songs &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; and &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot; had Grammy nominations for &#x27;Best Rock Song&#x27; and &#x27;Best Hard Rock Performance&#x27; respectively.

==Recording and lyrical themes==
The writing and recording process, according to Erna, was a self-contained one in which the band holed up in a rented home in Miami, Florida and wrote without distraction or influence from the rock music scene going on around them.

On the subject of the album, Erna told LAUNCH Media: &quot;It&#x27;s a bit more musical at times, it&#x27;s a bit more melodic, but it&#x27;s still raw,&quot; Erna said. &quot;It&#x27;s still tough. It&#x27;s still got that Godsmack edge to it, but it&#x27;s not quite as angry, maybe, as the past stuff has been. But it&#x27;s still got its rawness...Well, I shouldn&#x27;t say that. There&#x27;s a couple of nasty fuckin&#x27; songs on this record. But all in all I think it&#x27;s just really, I think, some well written stuff. I&#x27;m really proud of it.&quot; Erna found inspiration after reading Rush drummer Neil Peart&#x27;s book &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;, and penned the new song &quot;Serenity&quot;, which Merrill says is similar in motif to the tribal-drum sound of Godsmack&#x27;s past hit &quot;Voodoo&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Faceless&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 269,000 copies in its first week, and the album would go on to sell over one million copies in the United States, &quot;Faceless&quot; beat Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Meteora&quot;, which dropped to number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Faceless&quot; also debuted at number nine on the Top Canadian Albums and at number one on the Top Internet Albums and remained at the specific chart for two weeks.

The second single &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot; received a Grammy Award nomination for &quot;Best Hard Rock Performance.&quot; The award went to Evanescence&#x27;s single, &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;.

Erna remembered that the band was rehearsing for the tour a few months back when they got the news that the album had debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. &quot;Well, we were in West Palm Beach, Florida rehearsing for this tour and the call came in and it blew my mind because we worked really hard on this record and we wanted people to love it and we wanted it to do well,&quot; Erna says. &quot;But we had no idea that it would be the Number One album in the country and it&#x27;s very gratifying to know that you&#x27;re rewarded at times for the hard work you do.&quot;

The song &quot;I Fucking Hate You&quot; appeared in the TV spots for the movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, albeit an instrumental version.

==Reception==
The album received generally mixed reviews from critics upon its release. It holds a score of 50/100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Wade Kergan, writing for AllMusic, awarded the album two and a half out of five stars and commented that although the album has &quot;successful moments&quot;, but lacks the &quot;pop hooks&quot; of their debut and often sounds &quot;sorely underwritten&quot;. Chris Willman for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was similarly lukewarm towards the album, calling it &quot;the same staccato riffing, constipated vocals, and generic, rage-against-the-kidney-stone angst.&quot; Christian Hoard of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also denigrated the album, awarding it two stars and commenting that although the music is &quot;well-constructed&quot;, it &quot;sounds like a nightmare that&#x27;s more played-out than scary.&quot;

Some critics were more positive regarding the album, however. AntiMusic&#x27;s review felt that the group &quot;hit(s) a little harder&quot; and praised the album as Godsmack&#x27;s &quot;strongest effort to date&quot;, awarding the album four stars. KNAC also awarded the album four stars and called the album &quot;good loud aggressive heavy (slightly) pop-rock.&quot;

<doc id="186833" wikidata="Q289396" url="?curid=186833" title="Carol Moseley Braun">
<text>Carol Elizabeth Moseley Braun, also sometimes Moseley-Braun (born August 16, 1947), is an American diplomat, politician, and lawyer who represented Illinois in the United States Senate from 1993 to 1999. Moseley Braun was the first African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, the first African-American U.S. senator from the Democratic Party and the first female U.S. senator from Illinois.

Moseley Braun was a member of the Illinois House of Representatives from 1979 to 1988 and served as Cook County Recorder of Deeds from 1988 to 1992. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992 after defeating Senator Alan J. Dixon in a Democratic primary. Moseley Braun served one term in the Senate and was defeated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald in 1998.

Following her Senate tenure, Moseley Braun served as the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa from 1999 to 2001. She was a candidate for the Democratic nomination in the 2004 U.S. presidential election; she withdrew from the race prior to the Iowa caucuses. In November 2010, Moseley Braun began a campaign for mayor of Chicago to replace retiring incumbent Richard M. Daley. She placed fourth in a field of six candidates, losing the 2011 election to Rahm Emanuel. In January 2023, she was nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as a member and chair of the board of directors for the United States African Development Foundation, and began her tenure in April 2024.

== Early life, education, family, and early career ==
Carol Elizabeth Moseley was born in Chicago. She attended public and parochial schools. She attended Ruggles School for elementary school, and she attended Parker High School (now the site of Paul Robeson High School) in Chicago. Her father, Joseph J. Moseley, was a Chicago police officer and jail guard and her mother, Edna A. (Davie), was a medical technician in a hospital. Both her parents were Catholic, and Moseley was raised in the faith.

The family lived in a segregated middle-class neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. Her parents divorced when she was in her teens, and she lived with her grandmother.

Moseley began her undergraduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, but dropped out after four months. She then majored in political science at the University of Illinois at Chicago, graduating in 1969. Moseley earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Chicago Law School in 1972.

In 1973, Moseley married Michael Braun, whom she had met in law school. The couple had one son, Matthew, in 1977. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1986.

Moseley Braun worked as a prosecutor in the United States Attorney&#x27;s office in Chicago from 1973 to 1977. As an Assistant United States Attorney, she worked primarily in the civil and appellate law areas. Her work in housing, health policy, and environmental law won her the Attorney General&#x27;s Special Achievement Award. She stopped working as a prosecutor after her son&#x27;s birth, and briefly became a homemaker before being persuaded to run for the Illinois state legislature.

== Early political career ==
Moseley Braun was first elected to public office in 1978, when she was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. She became the first African American woman to serve as assistant majority leader in that body. As a state representative, she became recognized as a champion for liberal social causes. As early as 1984, she proposed a moratorium on the application of the death penalty in Illinois. In what became a landmark reapportionment case, &quot;Crosby v. State Board of Elections&quot;, she successfully sued her own party and the state of Illinois on behalf of African-American and Hispanic citizens. When she left the state legislature, her colleagues recognized her in a resolution as &quot;the conscience of the House.&quot; In 1988, she was elected Cook County Recorder of Deeds, a post she held for four years.

== U.S. Senator from Illinois ==
=== Elections ===
In 1992, angered by incumbent Democratic senator Alan Dixon&#x27;s vote to confirm Clarence Thomas despite accusations of sexual harassment from Anita Hill, Moseley Braun challenged Dixon in the primary election for his seat. She was backed by the political coalition from the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago that had previously backed the campaigns of Harold Washington and Jesse Jackson. Democratic candidate Albert Hofeld&#x27;s campaign ran many anti-Dixon ads, and Moseley Braun won the Democratic primary. On November 3, 1992, Moseley Braun became the first African American woman to be elected to the United States Senate, defeating Republican Richard S. Williamson. Moseley Braun was also the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Illinois and the first African American elected to the U.S. Senate as a Democrat.

Moseley Braun was a one-term senator, losing to Republican Peter Fitzgerald in her re-election bid in 1998.

=== Tenure ===
Moseley Braun is the first African American woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Along with Republican Edward Brooke, she was one of two African Americans to serve in the Senate in the 20th century. Moseley Braun was the sole African American in the Senate during her tenure. She was also the first woman to serve on the Senate Finance Committee.

Despite her reputation as a liberal Democrat, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution. Moseley Braun also voted to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada; this move was strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially future Majority Leader Harry Reid.

On social issues, however, Moseley Braun was significantly more liberal than many of her fellow senators. She was strongly pro-choice, voting against the ban on partial-birth abortions and the restrictions on funding in military bases for abortions. She also voted against the death penalty and in favor of gun control measures. Moseley Braun was one of only fourteen to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act. She delivered a eulogy for Thurgood Marshall in January 1993.

Moseley Braun was the subject of a 1993 Federal Election Commission investigation over $249,000 in unaccounted-for campaign funds. The agency found some small violations, but took no action against Moseley Braun, citing a lack of resources. Moseley Braun only admitted to bookkeeping errors. The Justice Department turned down two requests for investigations from the IRS.

Women were not allowed to wear pants on the U.S. Senate floor until 1993. In 1993, Senators Moseley Braun and Barbara Mikulski wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule. Soon after, female support staff followed their example. Later that year, the rule was amended by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore jackets.

In 1993, Moseley Braun made headlines when she convinced the Senate Judiciary Committee not to renew a design patent for the United Daughters of the Confederacy because it contained the Confederate flag. The patent had been routinely renewed for nearly a century, and despite the Judiciary Committee&#x27;s disapproval, the Senate was poised to pass a resolution sponsored by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that included a provision to authorize the extension of the federal patent. Moseley Braun threatened to filibuster the legislation &quot;until this room freezes over.&quot; She also made a plea to her colleagues about the symbolism of the Confederate flag, declaring, &quot;It has no place in our modern times, place in this body, place in our society&quot;. Swayed by Moseley Braun&#x27;s argument, the Senate rejected the UDC&#x27;s application to renew its patent.

In 1996, Moseley Braun made a private trip to Nigeria, where she met with dictator Sani Abacha. Despite U.S. sanctions against that country due to Abacha&#x27;s actions, the Senator neither notified nor registered her trip with the State Department. She subsequently defended Abacha&#x27;s human rights record in Congress. Her former fiancé Kgosie Matthews, who also served on her campaign staff in violation of U.S. immigration regulations, had been a lobbyist for the Nigerian government; Matthews would later leave the country. She paid Matthews, a native of South Africa, a salary of $15,000 a month during the campaign.

In 1998, after George Will wrote a column reviewing the allegations of corruption against her, Moseley Braun responded to Will&#x27;s comments, saying that &quot;I think because he couldn&#x27;t say nigger, he said corrupt&quot;. She also compared Will to a Ku Klux Klansman, saying: &quot;I mean this very sincerely from the bottom of my heart: He can take his hood and put it back on again, as far as I&#x27;m concerned&quot;. Later, Moseley Braun apologized for her remarks.

== U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa ==

On October 8, 1999, President Clinton nominated Moseley Braun to be the United States Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa. Although her nomination ran into token opposition from her old adversary, Jesse Helms, and from the senator who defeated her, Peter Fitzgerald, the Senate confirmed her on November 10, 1999, in a 96–2 vote. She served in these roles until 2001.

==2004 presidential campaign==

===Exploratory committee and campaign launch===
Analysts had speculated that Moseley Braun was preparing for a potential run to reclaim her former Senate seat in the 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois. However, in January 2003, Braun decided against running for the U.S. Senate again. On February 18, 2003, she announced her intention to run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, doing so in a speech delivered at the University of Chicago Law School. Braun thereafter launched an exploratory committee for a presidential campaign. She had, in the days leading up to this announcement, made her first campaign-season visits to the early primary and caucus states of New Hampshire, Iowa, and South Carolina. In her announcement speech she declared, &quot;It&#x27;s time to take the &#x27;men only&#x27; sign off the White House door.&quot; She joined an already sizable field of candidates for the Democratic nomination.

When asked about her prospects of winning at the launch of her exploratory committee, Moseley Braun declared &quot;I have every hope and every expectation that this will be a successful effort. I&#x27;m running for president. I&#x27;m not running just to be another pretty face.&quot; Many, however, regarded her campaign to be a long shot, with many also regarding it as more of a vanity campaign then a serious effort for the presidency. Some speculation even existed that she was running to siphon black voters away from Al Sharpton&#x27;s candidacy. Other speculation existed that she was running in an effort to redeem her image after her scandals as a senator and 1998 reelection defeat.
After this exploratory phase, Braun formally launched her candidacy on September 23, 2003. Moseley Braun&#x27;s campaign operation was initially based between two headquarters, one in Chicago and one in Washington, D.C. They were later consolidated to a single headquarters in Chicago.

===Positions on issues===
By July 2003, Moseley Braun had failed to release any detailed policy papers. Eric Slater of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that, during the debates and forums, rather than focusing on policy, Moseley Braun largely partook in jockeying against candidates such as Sharpton and Howard Dean to appear like the candidate who stood in greatest contrast to incumbent Republican George W. Bush. Despite her lack of policy papers, Braun did voice her positions on a number of issues.

Moseley Braun made her support for a single-payer healthcare system a signature issue of her candidacy. Her proposal was for such a system to be paid for by direct income tax. She also proposed merging Medicare and Medicaid into a unified health program. When she launched her exploratory campaign, she positioned herself in opposition to a potential war with the country of Iraq, which would ultimately materialize months later as the Iraq War. After that war began, she would criticize president George W. Bush for how he proceeding in going to war with what she considers disregard for the United Nations, and would criticize the United States Congress for &quot;abdicating its constitutional role&quot; in allowing Bush to go to war. She also raised concerns about the rising national budget deficit. She described herself as a &quot;budget hawk peace dove&quot;, and called for the national budget to be balanced. She ran in general opposition to the measures implemented by the Bush administration in the aftermath of 9/11, arguing that their policies were exploiting Americans&#x27; fear after the attacks to put in place &quot;an extreme agenda, dangerous and divisive&quot; and to take away civil liberties. She was particularly critical of United States attorney general John Ashcroft&#x27;s expansion law enforcement powers. She argued that the United States should combat terrorism by addressing underlying causes of it, such as by fostering &quot;stability and opportunity&quot; within failed states that might otherwise &quot;provide fertile recruiting grounds for terrorists and extremists.&quot; She pledged to regain global goodwill for the United States and restore international cooperation that she argued had dissipated due to Bush&#x27;s post-9/11 actions.

Moseley Braun also called for a reversal to childcare and education funding cuts, proposing funding the reinstatement of previous funding by eliminating the Bush tax cuts, simplifying the tax process, and eliminating any corporate loopholes that incentivize the offshoring of corporate operations. She opposed school voucher programs, asserting her belief that they deprived public schools of resources. She argued that state and federal funding for public schools needed to be increased to decrease the burden carried by local taxes, arguing that there was a &quot;disproportionate burden property tax payers carry to fund America&#x27;s public schools.&quot;

Moseley Braun argued that the United States should position itself as a leading force in achieving the environmental goals of the Kyoto Protocol, and should invest in environmental technologies with the goal of eliminating the United States&#x27; reliance on fossil fuels (including foreign oil). She also opposed extracting oil in protected areas, especially pointing to locations in Alaska. She also called for the United States to pressure international free trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization to make the protection of labor rights, human rights, and environmental standards prerequisites for countries to involve themselves in international trade.

Moseley Braun also opposed any privatization of Social Security, and voiced support for increasing the availability Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and pensions to low-income workers and women in order to remove inequity in retirement security.

===Campaign operations===
Moseley Braun&#x27;s campaign strategy had placed an emphasis on hopes of performing well in the South Carolina primary. With that primary&#x27;s traditionally sizable black electorate, it was seen to be a likely test of black enthusiasm for her candidacy. Moseley Braun was one of only two major black contenders for the Democratic nomination in 2004, with the other being Al Sharpton. Moseley Braun was also the only significant female candidate running in the 2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Moseley Braun&#x27;s campaign would ultimately end up focusing their efforts on the African-American and female vote, which they regarded to be her base of support.

Moseley Braun&#x27;s campaign struggled to raise funds. In the first three months of 2003, she raised only $72,450 for her candidacy, less than any other notable contenders in the Democratic primary. As a consequence, she had very few professional campaign staffers. Her campaign was instead largely run by a small number of volunteers. It took until July 1, 2003, for her campaign to hire a formal campaign manager. As the race developed, she continued to trail the other candidates in terms of fundraising. By July 2003, she had only raised $214,000, continuing to be lowest-performing of the nine major Democratic contenders in terms of fundraising. By November 2003, she had only raised $342,518. In total, her campaign would ultimately raise just under $600,000.

In mid-November 2003, Moseley Braun hired Patricia Ireland to serve as her campaign&#x27;s new manager.

Moseley Braun never performed higher than single-digit numbers in polls for the primaries. Moseley Braun also failed to qualify for the ballot in a number of the scheduled state primaries and caucuses. On January 15, 2004, two days after a disappointing third place showing in the D.C. primary and four days before the Iowa caucuses, Moseley Braun dropped out of the race and endorsed Howard Dean&#x27;s candidacy. Shortly before Moseley Braun withdrew, her own campaign manager, Patricia Ireland, had publicly conceded that she no longer believed Moseley Braun stood any chance of capturing the Democratic nomination. Upon her departure from the race, Ron Fournier of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; wrote that, &quot;she leaves the race after having made no impact on it, except for some bright moments in the presidential debates&quot;.

== 2011 campaign for mayor of Chicago ==
In November 2010, after Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley announced that he would not seek re-election, Moseley Braun announced she would run for mayor of Chicago in 2011. In early 2011, two potentially strong African-American candidates—U.S. Rep. Danny Davis and State Sen. James Meeks—left the race and endorsed Moseley Braun, making her the so-called consensus black candidate. This came after a discussions between Moseley Braun and the other two candidates where it was decided that Moseley Braun, with her profile as a former US Senator, ambassador, and presidential candidate, would be the strongest of the three candidates. These discussions had occurred with the involvement of Chicago African American figures such Jesse Jackson and Walter Burnett Jr.

Moseley Braun appeared likely to be a strong contender for the mayoralty. However, a series of scandals and blunders would result in her finishing fourth in the election.

Moseley Braun had several difficulties with her candidacy, including a lack of funding. She raised approximately $705,000, while Rahm Emanuel raised over $15 million. While referred to as the &quot;consensus&quot; African American candidate, she was not receiving much financial backing or from African American politicians and community leaders, many of whom instead backed Rahm Emanuel. Only a few of the city&#x27;s African-American business leaders (including Elzie Higginbottom and John W. Rogers Jr.) contributed to her campaign. She also received $25,000 from congressman Bobby Rush. With a lack of funds, Moseley Braun only was able to air a single television ad, which she ran late in the campaign. African American politicians and community leaders also did not provide non-financial assistance to Moseley Brown&#x27;s campaign effort. Moseley Braun&#x27;s campaign also received no support from trade unions. Moseley Braun encountered criticism for accepting donations from individuals who had already donated the $5,000 maximum (which was instituted January 1, 2011 when the Illinois Campaign Disclosure Act went into effect).

Additionally, Moseley Braun suffered from a poorly run campaign. There was internal conflict within Moseley Braun&#x27;s campaign organization. Her candidacy was also plagued by gaffes, including missed interviews and an inability to provide a sufficient explanation for her past financial problems. However, the most serious debacle came in a debate on January 30, 2011, when Moseley Braun accused another candidate, Patricia Van-Pelt Watkins, of &quot;being strung out on crack&quot; for 20 years. Van-Pelt Watkins had once been addicted to cocaine, but had been clean for 30 years. This attack on Van-Pelt Watkins backfired and was detrimental to Moseley Braun&#x27;s own candidacy. Braun&#x27;s campaign, which had never gained much traction, began to bleed what support it had after she made this attack, with many former supporters fleeing to support Emanuel instead.

As a candidate, Moseley Braun opposed moving the city to having an elected school board. Moseley Braun also criticized frontrunner Rahm Emanuel&#x27;s tax proposals, arguing that they would fail to assist poorer Chicagoans. She also accused Emanuel of having numerous times voted against Congressional Black Caucus proposals that would have assisted lower-income families. As a candidate, Braun also placed an emphasis on her governmental experience and her ties to the city&#x27;s black community.

On February 22, 2011, Moseley Braun came in fourth in the field of six, receiving about nine percent of the vote. In her concession speech, she remarked that her young niece could become the first female mayor of Chicago, despite the fact that Jane Byrne had already served as Chicago&#x27;s first female mayor.

== Later political activities ==
In the 2016 Democratic U.S. Senate primary in Maryland, Moseley Braun endorsed Donna Edwards. In the 2019 Chicago mayoral election runoff, Moseley Braun endorsed Toni Preckwinkle. In the 2023 Chicago mayoral election runoff, Moseley Braun endorsed Brandon Johnson.

In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Moseley Braun endorsed Joe Biden. During the November 2019 Democratic presidential debate, Biden mentioned her endorsement, misspeaking and mistakenly referring to her as &quot;the &quot;only&quot; African-American woman who&#x27;s ever been elected to the United States Senate&quot;, only to be quickly corrected by his opponents, including Kamala Harris, who herself happened to be the second (and, at the time, only other) African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. This gaffe of Biden&#x27;s attracted significant media attention. Moseley Braun traveled to various states to campaign on Biden&#x27;s behalf. At the 2020 Democratic National Convention, she was responsible for announcing Illinois&#x27; votes in the roll call. After Biden&#x27;s victory in the general election (with Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate), Moseley Braun made it publicly known that she was interested in being his Secretary of the Interior. She also expressed interest in holding some other role in his administration. Biden opted to nominate Deb Haaland for Secretary of the Interior. Soon after Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election, Moseley Braun voiced her support for Vice President Harris&#x27; candidacy to be nominated for president at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

==United States African Development Foundation==

In January 2023, Biden nominated Moseley Braun to be member and chair of the board of directors of the United States African Development Foundation. In January 2024, Biden again put forth the nomination. The nomination to serve on the board was confirmed on March 8, 2024. Her term on the board will extend until September 22, 2029. She was sworn in as board member and chair in April 2024.

==Work outside government and politics==
In 2005, Moseley Braun founded an organic products company known as Good Food Organics. Good Food Organics was the parent company of Ambassador Organics. As of 2019, the company was defunct.

Moseley Braun became a visiting professor of political science at Northwestern University in November 2016.

&quot;Trailblazer: Perseverance in Life and Politics&quot;, a memoir authored by Moseley Braun, is scheduled to be published on January 21, 2026, by Hanover Square Press.

== Personal life ==

In September 1998, Lauryn Kaye Valentine applied for permission to change her name to Carol Moseley Braun. Valentine cited the former senator as her hero and promised not to &quot;dishonor [the] name&quot;. The change was made official. That December, however, Valentine put her name forward as a candidate for alderman of Chicago&#x27;s 37th Ward. Before the election, a Circuit Court judge rescinded the name change, forcing Valentine to revert to her original name. Valentine was later ruled ineligible to run, as she was not a registered voter at the time because of her name changes.

In April 2007, Braun suffered a broken wrist when a emerged from bushes near her front door to steal her purse. Braun resisted and fell during the struggle, fracturing her left wrist. The mugger was chased off by a University of Chicago student while his girlfriend called 911. Braun was later treated at a hospital and released. A man was later charged with the crime and was sentenced to 20 years in prison on July 11, 2008.

Braun&#x27;s financial problems made headlines in October 2012 when it was revealed that her home was in foreclosure and that she had not made any mortgage payments for over a year. Before she was evicted, she sold her house for approximately $200,000 less than the amount she still owed on her mortgage loan.
