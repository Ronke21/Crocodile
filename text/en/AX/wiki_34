<text>A United Nations General Assembly resolution is a decision or declaration voted on by all member states of the United Nations in the General Assembly.

General Assembly resolutions usually require a simple majority (more yes votes than no votes) to pass. However, if the General Assembly determines that the issue is an &quot;important question&quot; by a simple majority vote, then a two-thirds majority (twice as many yes votes as no votes) is required; &quot;important questions&quot; are those that deal significantly with the maintenance of international peace and security, admission of new members to the United Nations, suspension of the rights and privileges of membership, the expulsion of members, operation of the trusteeship system, or budgetary questions.

Although General Assembly resolutions are generally non-binding towards member states, internal resolutions may be binding on the operation of the General Assembly itself, for example with regard to budgetary and procedural matters.

<text>The Gay Games is a worldwide sport and cultural event that promotes acceptance of sexual diversity, featuring lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) athletes, artists and other individuals.

Founded as the Gay Olympics, it was started in the United States in San Francisco, California, in 1982, as the brainchild of Olympic decathlete (Mexico City 1968) and medical doctor Tom Waddell, Brenda Young, and others, whose goals were to promote the spirit of inclusion and participation, as well as to promote the pursuit of personal growth in a sporting event. Waddell wanted to recreate the Olympics&#x27; power to bring people of various different backgrounds together through the international language of sport, and the organizers of the first event strived to accommodate differences and achieve gender parity.

It retains similarities with the Olympic Games, including the Gay Games flame which is lit at the opening ceremony. The games are open to all who wish to participate, without regard to sexual orientation, and there are no qualifying standards. Competitors come from many countries, including those where homosexuality remains illegal and hidden.

The 1994 Gay Games, held in June in New York City to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the modern start of the LGBT movement in the United States, &quot;overtook the Olympics in size&quot; with 10,864 athletes compared to 9,356 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and 10,318 at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

== Federation of Gay Games ==
The Federation of Gay Games (FGG) is the sanctioning body of the Gay Games which was founded in 1982 by Tom Waddell, after he dealt first-hand with the prejudice towards gay athletes and their inability to openly participate in sporting events. The Federation of Gay Games hosts the world&#x27;s biggest cultural and sporting event for the LGBTQ community every four years. The Federation of Gay Games is founded on the principles of &quot;participation, inclusion, and personal best&quot; and continues to support the LGBT community not only through the Gay Games but through scholarships for underprivileged members. The Federation of Gay Games continues to expand throughout the world and accepts members of any sexual orientation and nationality to participate in the games or contribute. The FGG is planning on hosting the next Gay Games in 2026 in Valencia.From its statement of concept and purpose:
== Host nations and cities ==

===Gay Games I: San Francisco 1982===

The 1982 games took place in San Francisco from August 28 to September 5, 1982. Singer Tina Turner performed at the opening ceremonies, and Stephanie Mills performed at the closing ceremonies. San Francisco was chosen as the location for the first Gay Games not only because it was the home of founder Tom Waddell, but also because the games had support from local government and essential services, and because there was a large gay and lesbian population in San Francisco that could serve as volunteers and leaders. The opening ceremonies, held in Kezar Stadium, began with former U.S. Olympians, George Frenn and Susan McGreivy lighting a flame that had been carried on a torch run across America, beginning in New York at the Stonewall Inn. The original sports that were offered at the first Gay Games were; basketball, billiards, bowling, cycling, diving, golf, marathon, physique, powerlifting, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. 1,350 competitors whose origins ranged from over 170 cities worldwide competed in the first Gay Games. In order to achieve greater inclusion and diversity, the organizers of the first Gay Games created outreach committees to attract and recruit athletes from minority groups including people of color, women, and rural lesbians and gays. Because Waddell disliked the nationalism of major sporting events like the Olympics, participants at the first games represented their cities rather countries, and competitive elements such as medal tallies, medal ceremonies, and recording athletic records were banned.

===Gay Games II: San Francisco 1986===

The 1986 games took place in San Francisco from August 9 to 17, 1986. Singers Jennifer Holliday and Jae Ross were the featured performers during the closing ceremonies. There was an increase of competing athletes in the second Gay Games participants to over 3,500.

===Gay Games III: Vancouver 1990===
The 1990 games took place in Vancouver, British Columbia, from August 4 to 11, 1990. Approximately 7,300 athletes took part in 27 sports, with another 1,500 cultural participants attending. This was the first games to be held outside the United States, and it is also notable for being the first games in which Masters world records were set (two, in swimming). The opening and closing ceremonies were held at BC Place Stadium, which, 20 years later, hosted the 2010 Winter Olympics opening and closing ceremony, making it a historic venue for both events.

The event was also heralded by controversy from social conservatives. A Fraser Valley church&#x27;s members took out full page ads in &quot;The Vancouver Sun&quot; and &quot;The Province&quot; condemning the event as proof of an &quot;impending sodomite invasion&quot; and encouraging residents to gather at Empire Stadium to pray against the event. The government of then-Premier Bill Vander Zalm refused to fund the event.

Original video documentation, photographs, and textual records related to Celebration &#x27;90 Gay Games III, originally gathered by Forward Focus, artist Mary Anne McEwen&#x27;s production company and official videographer of the Games. The items are available via VIVO Media Arts Centre&#x27;s archive, both in-person by appointment or digitally online. The fonds includes 143 unedited 30-minute Betacam recordings of sporting competitions, cultural events, opening and closing ceremonies, backstage activities and interviews with organizers, athletes, artists, community representatives, and opponents. The fond also includes 240 photographs, Celebration ’90 ephemera, and extensive textual materials, including the Official Program. McEwen was a Vancouver-based LGBTQ activist, Gayblevision co-founder, and co-organizer of the first Out On Screen Film and Video Festival. The footage was shot in anticipation of a feature-length documentary entitled, &quot;Legacy: The Story of the Gay Games&quot; that McEwen was unable to complete due to insufficient funding. McEwen, a longtime VIVO member, bequeathed her personal archive to VIVO hoping that this footage would be made widely available.

===Gay Games IV: New York 1994===
The 1994 games took place in New York City, New York, from June 18 to 25, 1994.

The games coincided with the 25th-anniversary events of the Stonewall riots and were themed on &quot;Unity&quot;. Actor Sir Ian McKellen gave the closing address at Yankee Stadium on June 25, 1994.

There were over 15,000 participants that either competed in the sporting events or in cultural ceremonies in the Gay Games of 1994. Greg Louganis, multiple-time World and Olympic Champion diver, served as the announcer and performed a spectacular three-meter springboard exhibition between events. The sporting events of Gay Games IV expanded to thirty one from previous years, including but not limited to, flag football, figure skating, and the first ever internationally sanctioned women&#x27;s wrestling.
===Gay Games V: Amsterdam 1998===

The 1998 games took place in Amsterdam, Netherlands, from August 1 to 8, 1998. The opening and closing ceremonies took place in the Amsterdam Arena. The participants&#x27; medal was designed by the noted Dutch designer Marcel Wanders.

===Gay Games VI: Sydney 2002===
The 2002 game took place in Sydney, New South Wales, from November 2 to 9, 2002. Sydney won the bid to host the games from other contenders which were Montreal, Toronto, Long Beach/Los Angeles and Dallas. The Games opening included a speech by out gay High Court of Australia Justice Michael Kirby and were officially opened by New South Wales Governor Professor Marie Bashir. When Gay Games VI was chosen to be in Sydney, Australia it was partially because of already present LGBTQI sport teams. The Sydney Gay Games were the first in the Southern Hemisphere and this was emphasized by the games theme &quot;Under new skies&quot;.

===Gay Games VII: Chicago 2006===

Gay Games VII were held in Chicago, Illinois, from July 15 to July 22, 2006. For more on the controversy surrounding Chicago&#x27;s selection as host city, see Schism in LGBT sports communities over Gay Games VII below.

===Gay Games VIII: Cologne 2010===

On March 16, 2005, the FGG announced that Cologne, Germany; Johannesburg, South Africa; and Paris, France, were the official candidate cities for Gay Games VIII in 2010. Cologne was elected at the FGG annual meeting in Chicago on November 14, 2005.

The games were held in Cologne from July 31 to August 6, 2010. This marked the second time the games were held in Europe, with the first being in Amsterdam in 1998.

===Gay Games IX: Cleveland and Akron 2014===

On March 17, 2009, the FGG announced that groups from Boston, Massachusetts; Cleveland, Ohio; and Washington, D.C., were finalists for the bidding to host Gay Games IX.

On September 29, 2009, at the FGG Site Selection Meeting in Cologne, Germany, Cleveland was chosen as presumptive host of Gay Games IX in 2014. The host organization, Cleveland Special Events Corporation, later expanded the host city to include nearby Akron, Ohio. They also chose to style their event as &quot;Gay Games 9&quot; rather than the traditional Roman numeral &quot;Gay Games IX&quot;.

===Gay Games X: Paris 2018===
On July 31, 2012, the FGG announced that seven cities had been approved as prospective bidders. The groups were from Amsterdam, Netherlands; Limerick, Ireland; London, United Kingdom; Orlando, Florida, United States; Paris, France; and a group proposing to host the Gay Games in either Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo, Brazil.

By August 31, 2012, letters of intent to bid had been received from all groups except those in Brazil.

In December 2012, the FGG announced that several requests from bidders to add new sports to the program of the games. Of these requests, that for the inclusion of polo was rejected, while those for archery, boxing, fencing, pétanque, roller derby and wheelchair rugby were approved. Of these, boxing, pétanque, roller derby and wheelchair rugby were included in the bids of the three finalist bidding organizations.

Bid books were provided by February 28, 2013, with a Q&amp;A held over April and May 2013. A shortlisting vote took place on May 31, 2013, resulting in the shortlisting of Limerick, London and Paris as the final three cities to continue on the 2018 Bid cycle. Shortlisted cities received a 4-day visit (inspection sites) from a team of FGG inspectors (4 delegates + 1 CM) in July 2013. The final vote took place in Cleveland (Ohio, USA) during the 2013 Annual General Assembly. On 7 October, Paris was elected host city for the 2018 Gay Games.


=== Gay Games XI: Hong Kong – Guadalajara 2023 ===
Hong Kong was announced as the host city of the 11th Gay Games, at a gala event at the Hotel de Ville in Paris, on October 30, 2017. They won with a clear majority of votes, in the first round of voting. It is the first time that the Gay Games have been held in Asia.

The &quot;longlist&quot; of cities interested in bidding to host Gay Games XI in 2022 was announced in April 2016. An unprecedented seventeen cities were interested in bidding. On 30 June 2016, the Federation of Gay Games announced that eleven cities had submitted their Letter Of Intent to formally bid. Anaheim, Atlanta, Des Moines, Madison, Minneapolis and San Antonio decided not to pursue their option to bid. On July 31, 2016, nine cities submitted their second registration fee to remain in the bid process. Both Cape Town and Tel Aviv dropped out at this stage, stating an intention to bid for Gay Games XII in 2026. On November 30, 2016, Bid Books were submitted by eight candidate cities with Los Angeles dropping out at this stage.

A shortlist of three Candidate Cities was announced on March 1, 2017. Guadalajara, Hong Kong and Washington, DC, hosted site visits before the final decision on the host city was made in Paris on Monday 30 October, where Hong Kong was announced as the host city.

Due to issues relating to the global coronavirus pandemic, the date of the Games was pushed back from 2022 to 2023. On 14 February 2022, Guadalajara was added as the co-host of this games.


Both events were attended by over five thousand participants across the two sites, who took part in a week of sports and culture.

The overwhelming tone of the comments from the Hong Kong participants was positive and appreciative. Participants and attendees congratulated the organizers on a job well done, expressing enjoyment and meaningful experiences at the Gay Games in Hong Kong. Many thanked the committee for their hard work, appreciating the inclusive atmosphere, and expressing gratitude for making history and supporting the LGBTQ+ community. There&#x27;s acknowledgment of the difficulties faced, but the general sentiment is one of praise and thankfulness for a successful event in Hong Kong. 

Participants in Mexico overwhelmingly expressed gratitude and praise for the Gay Games in Guadalajara. They describe it as a life-changing and pure experience that blends sport, culture, coexistence, and community. Many commended the organizers, highlighting the fantastic overall organization and the meaningful connection to local culture. Despite some acknowledging challenges, the general sentiment is one of appreciation, excitement, and a strong desire to participate again, particularly in Valencia 2026. The positive experiences range from the warmth of kindness, excellent event management, and the welcoming nature of Guadalajara to the joy of being part of a global LGBTQ+ community.

==Future Gay Games==

=== Gay Games XII: Valencia 2026 ===

The Federation of Gay Games published the call for interested cities on 19 December 2019, and the official RFI was issued on January 31, 2020. Prospective bidding cities had to submit the response to the RFI by February 21, 2020. At the early stage, evidence on social media existed for a bid by Brisbane, Australia and Brighton &amp; Hove, United Kingdom. Anecdotal evidence from the 2022 bid process also suggested that Tel Aviv, Israel, would bid again, seeking to bring the Gay Games to the Middle East for the first time, although this did not materialise. The press release issued on February 29 by the FGG stated: &quot;The Federation of Gay Games has received a record number of expressions of interest from cities around the globe desiring to be the host of the twelfth Gay Games XII to be held in 2026!&quot; A shortlist of three Candidate Cities was announced on March 1, 2021. On November 11, 2021 in Brighton, United Kingdom, Valencia, Spain was selected as the host for 2026.

Below is the official list of the candidate cities:

=== Gay Games XIII: 2030 ===
The bidding process for Gay Games XIII 2030 opened in January 2024, with 21 cities on 6 continents showing interest. 

Below is the list of prospective candidate cities:

Next steps in the bidding process will be:

June 2025 - Detailed Bid Books

* Finalist cities will now have to deliver a more detailed, compehensive document outlining the organisation of the event down to the smallest details to ensure everything is anticipated

November 2025 - Host city announced

* The culmination of the process will be the announcement of the presumptive 2030 host in November 2025 in Valencia, Spain

== Major issues ==
=== Lawsuit over &#x27;Gay Olympics&#x27; name ===
Tom Waddell, the former Olympian who helped found the games, intended them to be called the &quot;Gay Olympics&quot;, but a lawsuit filed less than three weeks before 1982&#x27;s inaugural Gay Olympics forced the name change. This forced volunteers to suspend the sales of buttons and t-shirts in order to remove the terms &quot;Olympic&quot; and &quot;Olympiad&quot; from medals, souvenirs, t-shirts, signs, and programs, which would cost the organization an estimated loss between $15,000 and $30,000.

Event organizers were sued by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) under the U.S. Amateur Sports Act of 1978, which gave the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) exclusive rights to the word &quot;Olympic&quot; in the United States. Defendants of the lawsuit contended that the law was capriciously applied and that if the Special Olympics were not similarly prohibited, the Gay Olympics should not be either.

Others, like Daniel Bell, cite the IOC&#x27;s long history of protecting the Olympics brand as evidence that the lawsuit against the &quot;Gay Olympics&quot; was not motivated by discrimination against gays. Since 1910 the IOC has taken action, including lawsuits and expulsion from the IOC, to stop certain organizations from using the word &quot;Olympics.&quot; Annual &quot;California Police Olympics&quot; were held for 22 years, from 1967 through 1989, after which, the word Olympics was no longer used for the event. The Supreme Court ruled for the USOC in &quot;San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Committee&quot;.

A 2009 documentary film, &quot;Claiming the Title: Gay Olympics on Trial&quot;, was created in the United States and was previewed at several film festivals. The subject was also included in a 2005 film by David Sector, &quot;Take the Flame! Gay Games: Grace Grit &amp; Glory&quot;.

In the years since the lawsuit, the Olympics and the Gay Games have set aside their initial hostilities and worked cooperatively together, successfully lobbying to have HIV travel restrictions waived for the 1994 Gay Games in New York and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

=== Plans to launch Gay Winter Games in Fall 1986 ===
Plans to launch a complementary Gay Winter Games, scheduled for February 1986 in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, collapsed, due to a lack of sufficient funding and logistical problems. There have been no subsequent attempts to launch a Gay Winter Games since, although Whistler, British Columbia, hosts an annual gay winter-sports festival.

=== Schism in LGBT sports communities over Gay Games VII ===

In 2001, the bidding organization from Montreal, Quebec, won the right to negotiate with the FGG for a licensing agreement to host the 2006 Gay Games, but after two years of failed negotiations Montreal broke off talks at the 2003 FGG annual meeting in Chicago. There were three main points of contention, over which neither party could agree:

* The size of the event
* The size of the budget especially the planned break-even participation point
* Financial transparency

In a weakening global economy following international terrorist attacks, including the September 11 attacks, the FGG wanted Montreal to be able to plan for a successful Gay Games even if participation did not meet Montreal&#x27;s optimistic projection of 24,000 participants, twice the level of participation of the previous Gay Games in 2002. Due to financial problems in previous events, the FGG also asked for transparency into Montreal 2006&#x27;s financial activities. After Montreal refused to continue talks, the FGG held a second round of bidding in which Chicago and Los Angeles bidders, who had put forth well-received bids to host the 2006 games in the first round along with Montreal and Atlanta, chose to bid. Ultimately, the FGG awarded Gay Games VII to Chicago Games, Inc.

The Montreal organizing committee nevertheless decided to proceed to hold an athletic and cultural event without the sanction of the FGG; this plan developed into the first edition of the World Outgames, and the creation of its licensing body, the Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association.

Due to limited personal and organizational resources, many individual and team participants were forced to choose between Gay Games Chicago and World Outgames Montreal, a situation exacerbated by the two events being a week apart. The closing ceremony of Gay Games Chicago on July 22, 2006, was only seven days before the opening ceremony of World Outgames Montreal on July 29, 2006. This meant that those who competed or performed in Chicago would have little recovery time before Montreal. The split resulted in a lower quality of athletic competition at both events because neither could claim the whole field of competitors. Team and individual sports were hurt alike.

Few teams were able to field complete squads for both events. In wrestling, 100 wrestlers competed in Chicago (comparable to previous Gay Games), but only 22 competed in Montreal, by far the lowest number for any major international tournament. There were some advantages to the games being so close together time wise and location wise. For some overseas participants who had to travel far, the convenience of the two events being only a week apart and not far from each other enabled them to attend both. Many did not attend at all. After Chicago drew 9,112 sport and cultural participants, of which 7,929 were from the US. Montreal drew 10,248 athletes, 1,516 Conference Attendees and 835 people to the cultural component of the games reflecting more than 111 countries more 60% of the organization&#x27;s original projections.&quot;

Since 2006, the need for a secondary global multisport event has been the subject of much debate, especially after the final financial figures for 2006 were released. In 2012, a round of negotiations between the FGG and GLISA ended after a mutually agreed deadline. The board of GLISA unanimously agree to the proposal set forth by the negotiation teams, however the FGG board did not reciprocate. The 7th Chicago Gay Games concluded with a net zero debt, while the Montreal World Outgames concluded with 5.3 million Canadian dollars in debt.

=== Media impact of AIDS on the Gay Games ===
Before and during the time of the 1986 Gay Games there was mass media about Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and how it was affecting the gay community. With the number of LGBTQ members at the Gay Games the founder Waddell took this time to try and break the stereotype of the AIDS with a show of athleticism the Gay Games had to offer. This also was a time that volunteers would provide safe sex materials along with condoms to educate the public.

<doc id="178985" wikidata="Q210598" url="?curid=178985" title="Tanis">
<text>Tanis ( ; ; ) or San al-Hagar (; ; ; or or ; ) is the Greek name for ancient Egyptian &quot;ḏꜥn.t&quot;, an important archaeological site in the northeastern Nile Delta of Egypt, and the location of a city of the same name. It is located on the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which has long since silted up.

The first study of Tanis dates to 1798 during Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s expedition to Egypt. Engineer Pierre Jacotin drew up a map of the site in the &quot;Description de l&#x27;Égypte&quot;. It was first excavated in 1825 by Jean-Jacques Rifaud, who discovered the two pink granite sphinxes now in the Musée du Louvre, and then by François Auguste Ferdinand Mariette between 1860 and 1864, and subsequently by William Matthew Flinders Petrie from 1883 to 1886. The work was taken over by Pierre Montet from 1929 to 1956, who discovered the royal necropolis dating to the Third Intermediate Period in 1939. The Mission française des fouilles de Tanis (MFFT) has been studying the site since 1965 under the direction of Jean Yoyotte and Philippe Brissaud, and François Leclère since 2013.

Today, the main parts of the temple dedicated to Amun-Ra can still be distinguished by the presence of large obelisks that marked the various pylons as in other Egyptian temples. Now fallen to the ground and lying in a single direction, they may have been knocked down by a violent earthquake during the Byzantine era. They form one of the most notable aspects of the Tanis site. Archaeologists have counted more than twenty. This accumulation of remnants from different epochs contributed to the confusion of the first archaeologists who saw in Tanis the biblical city of Zoan in which the Hebrews would have suffered pharaonic slavery. Pierre Montet, in inaugurating his great excavation campaigns in the 1930s, began from the same premise. He was hoping to discover traces that would confirm the accounts of the Old Testament. His own excavations gradually overturned this hypothesis, even if he was defending this biblical connection until the end of his life. It was not until the discovery of Qantir/Pi-Ramesses and the resumption of excavations under Jean Yoyotte that the place of Tanis was finally restored in the long chronology of the sites of the delta.

==History==
Tanis is unattested before the 19th Dynasty of Egypt, when it was the capital of the 14th nome of Lower Egypt. A temple inscription datable to the reign of Ramesses II mentions a &quot;Field of Tanis&quot;, while the city &quot;in se&quot; is securely attested in two 20th Dynasty documents: the Onomasticon of Amenope and the Story of Wenamun, as the home place of the pharaoh-to-be Smendes.

The earliest known Tanite buildings are datable to the 21st Dynasty. Although some monuments found at Tanis are datable earlier than the 21st Dynasty, most of these were in fact brought there from nearby cities, mainly from the previous capital of Pi-Ramesses, for reuse. Indeed, at the end of the New Kingdom the royal residence of Pi-Ramesses was abandoned because the Pelusiac branch of the Nile in the Delta became silted up and its harbour consequently became unusable.

After Pi-Ramesses&#x27; abandonment, Tanis became the seat of power of the pharaohs of the 21st Dynasty, and later of the 22nd Dynasty (along with Bubastis). The rulers of these two dynasties supported their legitimacy as rulers of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt with traditional titles and building works, although they pale compared to those at the height of the New Kingdom. A remarkable achievement of these kings was the building and subsequent expansions of the Great temple of Amun-Ra at Tanis (at the time, Amun-Ra replaced Seth as the main deity of the eastern Delta), while minor temples were dedicated to Mut and Khonsu whom, along with Amun-Ra, formed the Theban Triad. The intentional emulation towards Thebes is further stressed by the fact that these gods bore their original Theban epithets, leading to Thebes being more commonly mentioned than Tanis itself. Furthermore, the new royal necropolis at Tanis successfully replaced the one in the Theban Valley of the Kings.

After the 22nd Dynasty Tanis lost its status of royal residence, but became in turn the capital of the 19th nome of Lower Egypt. Starting from the 30th Dynasty, Tanis experienced a new phase of building development which endured during the Ptolemaic Period. It remained populated until its abandonment in Roman times.
In Late Antiquity, it was the seat of the bishops of Tanis, who adhered to the Coptic Orthodox Church.

By the time of John of Nikiû in the 7th century, Tanis appears to have already declined significantly, as it was grouped together with four other towns under a single prefect.

The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded San el-Hagar as a nahiyah in the district of Arine in Sharqia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 1,569 (794 men and 775 women).

==Ruins==
Though Tanis was briefly explored in the early 19th century, the first large-scale archaeological excavations there were made by Auguste Mariette in the 1860s. In 1866, Karl Richard Lepsius discovered a copy of the Canopus Decree, an inscription in both Greek and Egyptian, at Tanis. Unlike the Rosetta Stone, discovered 67 years earlier, this inscription included a full hieroglyphic text, thus allowing a direct comparison of the Greek text to the hieroglyphs and confirming the accuracy of Jean-François Champollion&#x27;s approach to deciphering hieroglyphs.

During the subsequent century the French carried out several excavation campaigns directed by Pierre Montet, then by Jean Yoyotte and subsequently by Philippe Brissaud. For some time the overwhelming amount of monuments bearing the cartouches of Ramesses II or Merenptah led archaeologists to believe that Tanis and Pi-Ramesses were in fact the same. Furthermore, the discovery of the Year 400 Stela at Tanis led to the speculation that Tanis should also be identified with the older, former Hyksos capital, Avaris. The later re-discovery of the actual, neighbouring archaeological sites of Pi-Ramesses (Qantir) and Avaris (Tell el-Dab&#x27;a) made clear that the earlier identifications were incorrect, and that all the Ramesside and pre-Ramesside monuments at Tanis were in fact brought here from Pi-Ramesses or other cities.
There are ruins of a number of temples, including the chief temple dedicated to Amun, and a very important royal necropolis of the Third Intermediate Period (which contains the only known intact royal pharaonic burials, the tomb of Tutankhamun having been entered in antiquity). The burials of three pharaohs of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties – Psusennes I, Amenemope and Shoshenq II – survived the depredations of tomb robbers throughout antiquity. They were discovered intact in 1939 and 1940 by Pierre Montet and proved to contain a large catalogue of gold, jewelry, lapis lazuli and other precious stones, as well as the funerary masks of these kings.

The chief deities of Tanis were Amun; his consort, Mut; and their child Khonsu, forming the Tanite triad. This triad was, however, identical to that of Thebes, leading many scholars to speak of Tanis as the &quot;northern Thebes&quot;.

In 2009, the Egyptian Culture Ministry reported archaeologists had discovered a sacred lake in the temple of Mut at Tanis. The lake, built out of limestone blocks, had been 15 meters long and 5 meters deep. It was discovered 12 meters below ground in good condition. The lake could have been built during the late 25th–early 26th Dynasty.

In 2011, analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery, led by archaeologist Sarah Parcak of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, found numerous related mud-brick walls, streets, and large residences, amounting to an entire city plan, in an area that appears blank under normal images. A French archeological team selected a site from the imagery and confirmed mud-brick structures approximately 30 cm below the surface. However, the assertion that the technology showed 17 pyramids was denounced as &quot;completely wrong&quot; by the Minister of State for Antiquities at the time, Zahi Hawass.

==Cultural references==
The Biblical story of Moses being found in the marshes of the Nile River (Book of Exodus, ) is often set at Tanis, which is often identified with Zoan ( &quot;Ṣōʕan&quot;).

In the 1981 &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, Tanis is fictitiously portrayed as a lost city which was buried in antiquity by a massive sandstorm, before being rediscovered by a Nazi expedition looking for the Ark of the Covenant.

The Tanis fossil site, which may preserve unique remains from the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, is named after the city. The paleontologist Robert de Palma chose the name based on the significance of Tanis in the decipherment of hieroglyphs, as well as its role in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; as the hiding place of the Ark of the Covenant.

<doc id="178994" wikidata="Q7356563" url="?curid=178994" title="Rodeo–Chediski Fire">
<text>The Rodeo–Chediski Fire was a wildfire that burned in east-central Arizona beginning on June 18, 2002, and was not controlled until July 7. It was the worst forest fire in Arizona&#x27;s recorded history until June 14, 2011 when the Wallow Fire surpassed it. Several local communities, including Show Low, Pinetop-Lakeside, Heber-Overgaard, Clay Springs, and Pinedale, were threatened and had to be evacuated.

==Origin and development==
Initially, there were two separate fires. The first fire, the Rodeo, was reported on the afternoon of June 18 near the Rodeo Fairgrounds on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation by Cibecue. An arsonist was arrested on June 29 and was later charged. By early evening, around were ablaze. Increasing wind speeds fed the fire to over by the following morning, and when wind speeds increased to around the fire grew rapidly, increasing fourfold over the next three hours.

The Chediski Fire was first reported on the morning of June 20 near Chediski Peak east of Payson. It had been started by a stranded quad rider, Valinda Jo Elliott, trying to signal a news helicopter. Similarly fed by the strong winds, this fire spread to by mid-afternoon, and by the following morning it covered over .

By June 21, the Rodeo Fire had consumed around . Around 8,000 people were evacuated; by the end of the fire, around 30,000 people would be moved. The two burning areas approached through crosswinds over June 21 and June 22 as a further 11,000 people were ordered to leave their homes. The burning areas joined on June 23 having consumed around of woodland.

The fire&#x27;s progress slowed after the two merged and by June 26 the fire was 5% contained by backburning, line building, and aerial retardant drops – protecting the settlements of Clay Springs, Linden and Pinedale, but had burned. The fire was 28% contained by June 28, but it was not fully under control until July 7 at a cost of $43.1 million. 465 homes were destroyed in Pinedale and other small communities. The fire was declared a disaster area. RodeoFire.com was established at the fire&#x27;s onset as a portal for concerned citizens and family members acting as an event update website.

==Aftermath==
===Restoration===

Of the woodlands affected, (60.0%) was part of the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. Of the rest, (35.7%) was in the Apache–Sitgreaves National Forests and (2.3%) in the Tonto National Forest. The remaining destruction occurred on private land. The fire damaged or destroyed ecosystem resources, disrupted hydrologic functioning, and altered the loadings of flammable fuels on much of the ponderosa pine forest that was exposed to the burn.

After the fire, efforts were made to stabilize the landscape by burned area emergency response teams. Waterbars, s and K-rails were put in place and there were over two weeks of aerial seeding, dropping around of winter wheat or indigenous grass seeds over .

===Political consequences===

Political figures, including Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, blamed the fire on &quot;radical environmentalists&quot; and their opposition to logging to thin the forests. The Sierra Club responded by saying they have long supported the thinning of underbrush and small trees through controlled burns, not the logging of large trees. But this fire, among other devastating drought-year fires in the American West, helped propel new forest management laws, enacted by both the U.S. Congress and local authorities. Of these the most notable is the Healthy Forests Restoration Act, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2003. Although these policies presented high-profile, short-term solutions, the ecological effects of these policies are hotly debated among forestry experts.

===Legal actions===

The arsonist, who received a 10-year prison sentence in March 2004, was Leonard Gregg, a Cibecue resident who worked as a seasonal firefighter for the tribal fire department. He told investigators he had set two fires that morning (the first was quickly put out) in hopes of getting hired by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs for a quick-response fire crew. Gregg had previously worked as a BIA fire crew member, and was indeed among the first to be called in to fight the Rodeo Fire.

The stranded motorist, Valinda Jo Elliott, who started the Chediski portion of the fire was not charged with arson by the US Attorney&#x27;s office, much to the anger of local residents and the tribe. In 2009, a judge ruled that she is eligible to be tried in a civil suit in the White Mountain Apache tribal court. In 2014 the court ruled that she was liable for $1650 in civil penalties and $57,000,000 in restitution to the tribe.

<doc id="179011" wikidata="Q1028889" url="?curid=179011" title="GeForce 2 series">
<text>The GeForce 2 series (NV15) is the second generation of Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce line of graphics processing units (GPUs). Introduced in 2000, it is the successor to the GeForce 256.

The GeForce 2 family comprised a number of models. The &quot;GeForce 2 GTS&quot;, &quot;GeForce 2 Ultra&quot;, &quot;GeForce 2 Pro&quot;, and &quot;GeForce 2 Ti&quot; are based upon the original architecture (NV15), varying only by chip and memory clock speeds. For the low-end segment and OEMs, the &quot;GeForce 2 MX&quot; series (NV11) was created, from which the &quot;GeForce 2 Go&quot; was derived for laptops. In addition, the GeForce 2 architecture is used for the Quadro series on the Quadro 2 Pro, 2 MXR, and 2 EX cards with special drivers meant to accelerate computer-aided design applications.

==Architecture==
The GeForce 2 architecture (NV15) is similar to the previous GeForce 256 line but with various improvements. Compared to the 220 nm GeForce 256, the GeForce 2 is built on a 180 nm manufacturing process, making the silicon more dense and allowing for more transistors and a higher clock speed. The most significant change for 3D acceleration is the addition of a second texture mapping unit to each of the four pixel pipelines. Some say the second TMU was there in the original Geforce NSR (Nvidia Shading Rasterizer) but dual-texturing was disabled due to a hardware bug; NSR&#x27;s unique ability to do single-cycle trilinear texture filtering supports this suggestion. This doubles the texture fillrate per clock compared to the previous generation and is the reasoning behind the GeForce 2 GTS&#x27;s naming suffix: GigaTexel Shader (GTS). The GeForce 2 also formally introduces the NSR (Nvidia Shading Rasterizer), a primitive type of programmable pixel pipeline that is somewhat similar to later pixel shaders. This functionality is also present in GeForce 256 but was unpublicized. Another hardware enhancement is an upgraded video processing pipeline, called &quot;HDVP&quot; (high definition video processor). HDVP supports motion video playback at HDTV-resolutions (MP@HL).

In 3D benchmarks and gaming applications, the GeForce 2 GTS outperforms its predecessor by up to 40%. In OpenGL games (such as Quake III), the card outperforms the ATI Radeon DDR and 3dfx Voodoo 5 5500 cards in both 16 bpp and 32 bpp display modes. However, in Direct3D games running 32 bpp, the Radeon DDR is sometimes able to take the lead.

The GeForce 2 (NV15) architecture is quite memory bandwidth constrained. The GPU wastes memory bandwidth and pixel fillrate due to unoptimized z-buffer usage, drawing of hidden surfaces, and a relatively inefficient RAM controller. The main competition for GeForce 2 GTS, the Radeon DDR (R100), has hardware functions (called HyperZ) that address these issues. Because of the inefficient nature of the GeForce 2 GPUs, they could not approach their theoretical performance potential and the Radeon, even with its significantly less powerful 3D architecture, offered strong competition. The later NV17 revision of the NV11 design used in the GeForce4 MX was more efficient.

===Releases===
The first models to arrive after the original GeForce 2 GTS was the &quot;GeForce 2 Ultra&quot; and &quot;GeForce2 MX&quot;, launched on September 7, 2000. On September 29, 2000 Nvidia started shipping graphics cards which had 16 and 32 MB of video memory size.

Architecturally identical to the GTS, the Ultra simply has higher core and memory clock rates. Meant to be a niche product, it was rumored that GeForce 2 Ultra was intended to prevent 3dfx taking the lead with their Voodoo 5 6000 that was ending up never released as 3dfx went bankrupt. The Ultra model actually outperforms the first GeForce 3 products in some cases, due to initial GeForce 3 cards having significantly lower fillrate. However, the Ultra loses its lead when anti-aliasing is enabled, because of the GeForce 3&#x27;s new memory bandwidth/fillrate efficiency mechanisms; plus the GeForce 3 has a superior next-generation feature set with programmable vertex and pixel shaders for DirectX 8.0 games.

The &quot;GeForce 2 Pro&quot;, introduced shortly after the Ultra, was an alternative to the expensive top-line Ultra and is faster than the GTS.

In October 2001, the &quot;GeForce 2 Ti&quot; was positioned as a cheaper and less advanced alternative to the GeForce 3. Faster than the GTS and Pro but slower than the Ultra, the GeForce 2 Ti performed competitively against the Radeon 7500 (RV200), although the 7500 had the advantage of dual-display support. This mid-range GeForce 2 release was replaced by the GeForce4 MX series as the budget/performance choice in January 2002.

On their 2001 product web page, Nvidia initially placed the Ultra as a separate offering from the rest of the GeForce 2 lineup (GTS, Pro, Ti), however by late 2002 with the GeForce 2 considered a discontinued product line (being succeeded by the GeForce 4 MX), the Ultra was included along the GTS, Pro, and Ti in the GeForce 2 information page.

==GeForce 2 MX==
Since the previous GeForce 256 line shipped without a budget variant, the RIVA TNT2 series was left to fill the &quot;low-end&quot; role—albeit with a comparably obsolete feature set. In order to create a better low-end option, Nvidia created the GeForce 2 MX series (NV11), which offered a set of standard features similar to the regular GeForce 2 (NV15), limited only by categorical tier of lower performance. In order to reduce production costs, the GeForce 2 MX cards had two 3D pixel pipelines removed and a reduced available memory bandwidth. The cards utilized either SDR SDRAM or DDR SDRAM with memory bus widths ranging from 32 to 128 bits, allowing circuit board cost to be varied. The MX series also provided dual-display support, something not found in the GeForce 256 and GeForce 2. With performance approaching the GeForce 256 while also being much more economical to produce, the GeForce 2 MX was successful in the OEM and budget market.

The prime competitors in the OEM and budget segment were ATI&#x27;s Radeon SDR (which with all other R100 chip-equipped cards, regardless of clock/memory speed and memory configuration, was later renamed collectively as Radeon 7200), Radeon VE (RV100) (later renamed Radeon 7000), and the 3dfx Voodoo4 4500. Sharing the same R100 GPU as the higher-end Radeon 32MB DDR (US$230), the Radeon SDR (US$150) was equipped with SDR SDRAM instead of DDR SDRAM found in its more expensive brethren although this did not bring down costs sufficiently to match the GeForce 2 MX. Released 3 months after the GeForce 2 MX, the Radeon SDR lacked multi-monitor support but exhibited faster 32-bit 3D rendering over the GeForce 2 MX. 3dfx&#x27;s Voodoo4 4500 arrived too late, as well as being too expensive at US$150, but too slow to compete with Nvidia or ATI&#x27;s offerings, and also lacking multi-monitor support. Next up, the Radeon VE&#x27;s RV100 GPU was cut down considerably from the R100 to reduce production costs, so it did not offer hardware T&amp;L, an emerging 3D rendering feature of the day that was the major attraction of Direct3D 7. Further, the Radeon VE featured only a single rendering pipeline, causing it to produce a substantially lower fillrate than the GeForce 2 MX. However the Radeon VE (US$100) had the advantage of somewhat better dual-monitor display software while matching the GeForce 2 MX on price.

Members of the series include &quot;GeForce 2 MX&quot;, &quot;MX400&quot;, &quot;MX200&quot;, and &quot;MX100&quot;. The GPU was also used as an integrated graphics processor in the nForce chipset line and as a mobile graphics chip for notebooks called &quot;GeForce 2 Go&quot;.

The NVIDIA GeForce2 MX 400 is often considered underwhelming because of its limited capabilities. With just 32 MB of SDR memory and an outdated architecture based on the Celsius design, it struggles to perform efficiently. Its low GPU clock speed of 200 MHz and support for only DirectX 7.0 further hamper its ability to handle modern games and applications. In the context of today&#x27;s technology, the GeForce2 MX 400 is seen as outdated and insufficient for most graphic-intensive tasks.

==Successor==
The successor to the GeForce 2 (non-MX) line is the GeForce 3. The non-MX GeForce 2 line was reduced in price and saw the addition of the GeForce 2 Ti, in order to offer a mid-range alternative to the high-end GeForce 3 product.

Later, both the GeForce 2 and GeForce 2 MX lines were replaced with the GeForce4 MX.

== Models ==

* All models support TwinView Dual-Display Architecture, Second Generation Transform and Lighting (T&amp;L)
* GeForce2 MX models support Digital Vibrance Control (DVC)

===GeForce2 Go mobile GPU series===
* Mobile GPUs are either soldered to the mainboard or to some Mobile PCI Express Module (MXM).
* All models are manufactured with a 180 nm manufacturing process


== Discontinued support ==

Nvidia has ceased driver support for GeForce 2 series, ending with GTS, Pro, Ti and Ultra models in 2005 and then with MX models in 2007.

<text>Gotthilf Heinrich Ludwig Hagen (3 March 1797 – 3 February 1884) was a German civil engineer who made important contributions to fluid dynamics, hydraulic engineering and probability theory.

==Life and work==
Hagen was born in Königsberg, East Prussia (Kaliningrad, Russia) to Friedrich Ludwig Hagen and Helene Charlotte Albertine Hagen. His father was a government official and his mother was the daughter of Christian Reccard, professor of Theology at University of Königsberg, consistorial councillor and astronomer. He showed promise in mathematics in high school and he went on to study at the University of Königsberg where his uncle, Karl Gottfried Hagen was professor of physics and chemistry.

In 1816 Hagen began studying mathematics and astronomy with Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, but in 1818 he switched to study civil engineering as he was more attracted to applied than theoretical science. Nevertheless, he remained in close contact with Bessel throughout his life. In 1819 he undertook the examination for surveyors (Landvermesserprüfung) and after graduating took a job as a junior engineer (Baukondukteur) in the civil service. His main responsibility was for hydraulic engineering and water management. In 1822 he took the state examination in Berlin to qualify as a master builder (Baumeister). He became known through his publications about various hydraulic constructions which he had visited during travels in Europe.

In 1824 he was appointed director of building (Baukondukteur) by the mercantile community in Königsberg and in 1825 he became deputy governmental building officer (stellvertretender Regierungs- und Baurat) for Danzig (Gdańsk). A year later he transferred to become harbor building inspector (Hafenbauinspektor) in Pillau, where he was responsible for the harbor and dyke construction. Methods he developed are still relevant to current harbor management in the region.

On 27 April 1827 he married his niece Auguste Hagen (1806–1884), with whom he had two daughters and five sons. His son Ludwig Hagen also became a notable civil engineer.

In 1830 Hagen joined the supreme building authority (Oberbaudeputation) in Berlin and became chief government building surveyor (Oberbaurat) in 1831. From 1834 to 1849 he taught as a professor of hydraulic engineering at the Bauakademie and the United Artillery and Engineering School in Berlin. Hagen was unusual in stressing the mathematical and theoretical aspects of hydraulic engineering. In particular he was interested in using probability calculus for land surveying and this interest led to his contributions to probability theory. In a letter to Bessel dated 2 August 1836 Hagen presented his hypothesis of elementary errors and deduced a Gaussian distribution for observational errors. This idea was further developed in a book published in 1837 &quot;Grundzüge der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung mit besonderer Anwendung auf die Operationen der Feldmeßkunst&quot; (“Foundations of Probability Calculus with Special Application to the Operations of Land Surveying”) which applied probability theory and least squares techniques to construction and surveying and deduced an error law that was not based on inverse probability arguments.

===Hagen–Poiseuille equation===
In 1839 Hagen undertook careful experiments in brass tubes that enabled him to discover the relationship between the pressure drop and the tube diameter under conditions of laminar flow of homogeneous viscous liquids. Hagen observed an empirical power law relationship between the pressure drop (ΔP) and radius (R) of a tube corresponding to ΔP ∝ 1/R−4.12, but suggested in view of possible measurement errors that a value of 4.0 be assumed. This relationship was also discovered independently at around the same time by the French physicist and physiologist Jean Poiseuille
and is therefore now known as the Hagen–Poiseuille equation or Poiseuille&#x27;s law.

In 1849 he was appointed as an expert adviser (Sachverständiger) to the Frankfurt National Assembly and in 1850 was appointed expert councillor (Vortragenden Rat) in the Prussian Ministry of Commerce. 
In 1852 Hagen published a notable paper that described and explained two fundamental aspects of granular material: saturation of pressure with depth in a confined static granular system - generally known as the Janssen effect; and the dynamics of granular flow out of a container – sometimes called the Beverloo law - the foundation of the hourglass theory.

Hagen played a decisive role in planning the development of numerous German rivers and harbors. The Prussian Admiralty appointed him to supervise the planning of Wilhelmshaven in 1855. Hagen took leave from his post in the Ministry of Trade and became chair of the Commission for the port construction in the Jade Bight. After rejecting the designs of two internationally known experts, he proposed his own design to the Prussian Admiralty on 29 May 1856. This port design met the requirements of the Prussian Admiralty but also allowed for later expansions and additions. The design was approved by cabinet order on 25 June 1856. After completion of the planning, he returned to the Prussian Ministry of Trade on 12 August 1856. The implementation of the plan was carried out in the following decade, and despite many changes, still determines the current layout of the town center.

In 1863 Hagen published his encyclopaedic manual on hydraulic engineering. This represented the state of the art for coastal protection and served for decades as the guideline for coastal engineering in Germany.

In 1866 Hagen was promoted to chief director (Oberbaudirektor) in the Department of Hydraulic Engineering and chair (Vorsitzenden) of the section of public works in the Ministry of Trade (Baudeputation).

In 1869 he was made senior national building director (Oberlandesbaudirektor). This role involved responsibility for large water and harbor works in Prussia and other German States. He held this post until his retirement in 1875.

In 1872 suffered an accident on a business trip and was unable to walk in the subsequent period. Hagen died in 1884, his tomb is located on the Invalidenfriedhof Berlin, Scharnhorststraße near the main railway station.

==Honours and awards==
On 7 April 1842 Hagen was elected as a member of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, Berlin on the recommendation of Alexander von Humboldt. 
In 1843 Hagen received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bonn. 
In 1881 he was made a Freeman of Pillau
On 2 May 1883 he was awarded a gold medal for extraordinary services to the construction industry.

==Monuments and memorials==
After his death a monument to Hagen was built in Pillau. The monument is currently in Baltijsk and is now maintained by the Russian Navy. 

Gotthilf Hagen square was inaugurated in Wilhelmshaven in 2007. A sculpture in honor of Gotthilf Hagen was placed in the square. It was created by the artist Hartmut Wiesner.
In 1959 a pilot station ship, the &quot;Gotthilf Hagen&quot; was named after him

<text>Pamela Colman Smith (16 February 1878 – 16 September 1951), nicknamed &quot;Pixie&quot;, was a British artist, illustrator, writer, publisher, and occultist. She is best-known for illustrating the Rider–Waite Tarot (also known as the Rider–Waite–Smith or Waite–Smith Tarot) for Arthur Edward Waite. This tarot deck became the standard among tarot card readers, and remains the most widely used today. Smith also illustrated over 20 books, wrote two collections of Jamaican folklore, edited two magazines, and ran the Green Sheaf Press, a small press focused on women writers.

==Biography==
Smith was born at 28 Belgrave Road in Pimlico, part of central London. She was the only child of a merchant from Brooklyn, New York (before it was part of New York City), Charles Edward Smith (son of Brooklyn mayor Cyrus Porter Smith), and his wife Corinne Colman (sister of the painter Samuel Colman). The family was based in Manchester for the first decade of Smith&#x27;s life. In 1889, they moved to Jamaica when Charles Smith took a job with the West India Improvement Company, a financial syndicate involved in extending the Jamaican railroad system. The Smiths lived in the capital, Kingston, for several years, traveling to London and New York.

By 1893, Smith had moved to Brooklyn, where, at the age of 15, she enrolled at the Pratt Institute, which had been founded six years earlier. There she studied art under Arthur Wesley Dow, painter, print maker, photographer, and influential arts educator. Her mature drawing style shows clear traces of the visionary qualities of fin-de-siècle Symbolism and the Romanticism of the preceding Arts and Crafts movement. 

In 1896, while Smith was in art school, her mother died in Jamaica. Smith herself was ill on and off during these years and in the end left Pratt in 1897 without a degree. She became an illustrator; some of her first projects included &quot;The Illustrated Verses of William Butler Yeats&quot;, a book on actress Dame Ellen Terry by Bram Stoker, and two of her own books, &quot;Widdicombe Fair&quot; and &quot;Fair Vanity&quot; (a reference to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;).

In 1899 her father died, leaving Smith orphaned at the age of 21. She returned to England that year, continuing to work as an illustrator, and branching out into theatrical design for a miniature theatre. In London, she was taken under the wing of the Lyceum Theatre group led by Terry (who is said to have given her the nickname &#x27;Pixie&#x27;), Henry Irving, and Bram Stoker and traveled with them around the country, working on costumes and stage design.

In 1901, she established a studio in London and held a weekly open house for artists, authors, actors, and others involved with the arts. Arthur Ransome, then in his early 20s, describes one of these &quot;at home&quot; evenings, and the curious artistic circle around Smith, in his 1907 &quot;Bohemia in London&quot;.

Smith wrote and illustrated two books about Jamaican folklore: &quot;Annancy Stories&quot; (1899) and &quot;Chim-Chim, Folk Stories from Jamaica&quot; (1905). These books included Jamaican versions of tales involving the traditional African folk figure Anansi the Spider. She also continued her illustration work, taking on projects for William Butler Yeats and his brother, the painter Jack Yeats. She illustrated Bram Stoker&#x27;s last novel, &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot; in 1911, and Ellen Terry&#x27;s book on Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes, &quot;The Russian Ballet&quot; in 1913.

Smith supported the struggle for the right to vote, and through the Suffrage Atelier, a collective of professional illustrators, she contributed artwork to further the cause of women&#x27;s suffrage in Great Britain. Smith also donated her services for poster designs and toys to the Red Cross during World War I.

In 1903, Smith launched her own magazine under the title &quot;The Green Sheaf&quot;, with contributions by Yeats, Christopher St John (Christabel Marshall), Cecil French, A. E. (George William Russell), Gordon Craig (Ellen Terry&#x27;s son), John Todhunter, and others. &quot;The Green Sheaf&quot; survived for a little over a year, a total of 13 issues.

Discouraged by &quot;The Green Sheaf&#x27;s&quot; lack of financial success, Smith shifted her efforts towards setting up a small press in London. In 1904, she established The Green Sheaf Press which published a variety of novels, poems, fairy tales, and folktales until at least 1906, mostly by women writers.

In 1907, Alfred Stieglitz gave an exhibition of Smith&#x27;s paintings in New York at his Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession (also known as gallery 291), making Smith the first painter to have a show at what had been until then a gallery devoted exclusively to the photographic avant-garde. Stieglitz was intrigued by Smith&#x27;s synaesthetic sensibility; in this period, Smith would paint visions that came to her while listening to music. The show was successful enough that Stieglitz issued a platinum print portfolio of 22 of her paintings and showed her work twice more, in 1908 and 1909. Some Smith works that did not sell remained with Stieglitz and ended up in the Stieglitz/Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Archive at Yale University.
Yeats introduced Smith to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, which she joined in 1901 and in the process met Arthur Edward Waite. When the Golden Dawn splintered due to personality conflicts, Smith moved with Waite to the Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn (or Holy Order of the Golden Dawn). In 1909, Waite commissioned Smith to produce a tarot deck with appeal to the world of art, and the result was the unique Waite–Smith tarot deck. Published by William Rider &amp; Son of London, it has endured as the world&#x27;s most popular 78-card tarot deck. The innovative cards depict full scenes with figures and symbols on all of the cards including the pips, and Smith&#x27;s distinctive drawings have become the basis for the design of many subsequent packs.

Apart from book illustration projects and the tarot deck, her art found little in the way of commercial outlets after her early success with Stieglitz in New York. Several examples of her works done in gouache were collected by her cousin, the American Sherlock Holmes actor William Gillette, and may be found today prominently displayed in his castle in Connecticut.

In 1911, Smith converted to Roman Catholicism. After the end of the First World War, Smith received an inheritance from an uncle that enabled her to lease a house on the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall, an area popular with artists. For income, she established a holiday home for Catholic priests in a neighbouring house. Her longtime friend, Nora Lake, joined her in Cornwall and helped to run the vacation home.

After several years of financial difficulty, Smith left the Lizard and relocated first to Exeter in 1939, and then to Bude in the early 1940s. Although she continued writing and illustrating, she was unable to find publishers for her work, probably due to changes in public taste following the First World War.

Smith died in her apartment at the Bencoolen House in Bude on 18 September 1951. Her possessions were auctioned off to pay her debts. The location of her gravesite is unknown, but it is likely that she was buried in an unmarked grave in St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery in Bude.

==Waite–Smith Tarot==
The 78 illustrations that make up the Waite–Smith Tarot &quot;represent archetypal subjects that each become a portal to an invisible realm of signs and symbols, believed to be channeled through processes of divination.&quot; They are original works of art and unique in terms of the cards&#x27; stylization, draftsmanship, and composition, which is a significant aesthetic achievement. They are one of the best examples of Smith&#x27;s imagination for fantasy, folly, ecstasy, death, and the macabre.

The deck bearing Smith&#x27;s illustrations, first published in England by Rider in December 1909, were simply labeled &quot;Tarot Cards&quot; and accompanied by &quot;The Key to the Tarot&quot; guide by Arthur Edward Waite. His guide was updated the following year with Smith&#x27;s black-and-white drawings, and republished as &quot;The Pictorial Key to the Tarot&quot;. 

U.S. Games acquired the rights to publish the deck in 1971, released variously as &quot;The Rider Tarot Deck&quot;, simply &quot;Rider Tarot&quot;, and &quot;Rider Waite Tarot&quot;. Based on differences in U.S. and U.K. copyright law, the extent of their copyright in the Waite–Smith deck is disputed. Recent scholars, recognizing the central importance of Smith&#x27;s contribution, often refer to the deck as the &quot;Waite–Smith Tarot&quot;, while others prefer the abbreviation RWS, for Rider–Waite–Smith.

In the century since the deck&#x27;s first printing, there have been dozens of editions put out by various publishers; for some of these the Smith drawings were redrawn by other artists, and for others the cards were rephotographed to create new printing plates. Many versions have been recolored as the coloration is rather harsh in the original deck, due to the limitations of color printing at the time. One example is the 1968 Albano–Waite Tarot, which has brighter colors overlaid on the same pen-and-ink drawings. Some recent U.S. Games editions have removed Smith&#x27;s hand-drawn titles for each card, substituting text in a standard typeface. Altogether, these decks encompass the full range from editions very closely based on the original printings to decks that can at most be termed &#x27;inspired&#x27; by the Waite–Smith deck.

Waite is often cited as the designer of the Waite–Smith Tarot, but it would be more accurate to consider him as half of a design team, with responsibility for the major concepts, the structure of individual cards, and the overall symbolic system. Because Waite was not an artist himself, he commissioned Smith to create the actual deck.

It is likely that Smith worked from Waite&#x27;s written and verbal instructions rather than from sketches; that is, from detailed descriptions of the desired designs. This is how illustrators often work, and as a commercial illustrator, Smith would probably have been comfortable with such a working process. It appears that Waite provided detailed instructions mainly or exclusively for the Major Arcana, and simple lists of meanings for the Minor Arcana or &#x27;pip&#x27; cards. Thus the memorable scenes of the Minor Arcana owe largely to Smith&#x27;s own invention. The Minor Arcana are one of the notable achievements of this deck, as most earlier tarot decks, especially those of the Marseilles type, have extremely simple pip cards. Smith&#x27;s innovative illustrations for the Minor Arcana, with their rich symbolism, made the Waite–Smith deck a widely imitated model for other tarot decks.

Smith and Waite drew on a number of sources as inspirations for the deck&#x27;s designs. In particular, it appears that Waite took his inspiration for the trumps mainly from the French Tarot of Marseilles. The oldest date from the 16th century, with his model possibly being a Marseilles deck from the 18th century. It is not unlikely that other Marseilles-type Italian tarot decks from the 18th or 19th century were used as additional models. For the pips, it appears that Smith drew mainly on the 15th century Italian Sola Busca tarot; the 3 of Swords, for example, clearly shows the congruity between the two decks. In addition, there is evidence that some figures in the deck are portraits of Smith&#x27;s friends, notably actresses Ellen Terry (the Queen of Wands) and Florence Farr (the World).

Smith completed the art for the deck in the six months between April and October 1909. This is a short period of time for an artist to complete some 80 pictures, the number claimed by Smith in a letter to Stieglitz in 1909 and closely corresponding to the standard 78-card tarot deck. The illustrations were most likely done in pen and ink, possibly over a pencil underdrawing; the original drawings are lost so this cannot be determined with certainty at present. They were either colored with watercolor by Smith or colored by someone else after the fact.

== Posthumous exhibitions ==
The exhibition &quot;To All Believers—The Art of Pamela Colman Smith&quot; was held in the United States in 1975, sponsored by the University of Delaware and the Delaware Art Museum in association with the Delaware chapter of The Victorian Society in America. The exhibition was held at the Delaware Art Museum from 11 September to 19 October, and at the Art Museum, Princeton University, from 4 November to 7 December.

An exhibition, &quot;Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe and the Women of the Stieglitz Circle&quot;, was held in 2007–2008. It was at three museums: the Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico; the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia; and the San Diego Museum of Art in San Diego, California. The exhibition included works by Smith and other women artists who were active in the art and photography scene prior to O&#x27;Keeffe. Their works help to put O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s art in the context of the time. The exhibition was based on the scholarly book &quot;Modernism and the Feminine Voice: O&#x27;Keeffe and the Women of the Stieglitz Circle&quot; by Kathleen Pyne, which contains a chapter on Smith.

The Brooklyn Campus of the Pratt Institute Libraries mounted the exhibition &quot;Pamela Colman Smith: Life and Work&quot; in 2019, including books, prints, reproductions of paintings and illustrations, tarot decks, and photographs.

== Academic study ==
In 2022, Smith&#x27;s life and work became the subjects of &quot;The Queen of Wands: The Story of Pamela Colman Smith, the Artist Behind the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck&quot;, an illustrated biography by Cat Willett.

<doc id="179017" wikidata="Q6453184" url="?curid=179017" title="Dirichlet convolution">
<text>In mathematics, the Dirichlet convolution (or divisor convolution) is a binary operation defined for arithmetic functions; it is important in number theory. It was developed by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.

==Definition==
If formula_1 are two arithmetic functions from the positive integers to the complex numbers, the &quot;Dirichlet convolution&quot; is a new arithmetic function defined by:

:formula_2

where the sum extends over all positive divisors &quot;d&quot; of &quot;n&quot;, or equivalently over all distinct pairs of positive integers whose product is &quot;n&quot;.

This product occurs naturally in the study of Dirichlet series such as the Riemann zeta function. It describes the multiplication of two Dirichlet series in terms of their coefficients:
:formula_3

==Properties==

The set of arithmetic functions forms a commutative ring, the , under pointwise addition, where is defined by , and Dirichlet convolution. The multiplicative identity is the unit function &quot;ε&quot; defined by if and if . The units (invertible elements) of this ring are the arithmetic functions &quot;f&quot; with .

Specifically, Dirichlet convolution is associative,
:formula_4
distributive over addition
:formula_5,
commutative,
:formula_6,
and has an identity element,
: formula_7 = formula_8.
Furthermore, for each formula_9 having formula_10, there exists an arithmetic function formula_11 with formula_12, called the of formula_9.

The Dirichlet convolution of two multiplicative functions is again multiplicative, and every not constantly zero multiplicative function has a Dirichlet inverse which is also multiplicative. In other words, multiplicative functions form a subgroup of the group of invertible elements of the Dirichlet ring. Beware however that the sum of two multiplicative functions is not multiplicative (since formula_14), so the subset of multiplicative functions is not a subring of the Dirichlet ring. The article on multiplicative functions lists several convolution relations among important multiplicative functions.

Another operation on arithmetic functions is pointwise multiplication: is defined by . Given a completely multiplicative function formula_15, pointwise multiplication by formula_15 distributes over Dirichlet convolution: formula_17. The convolution of two completely multiplicative functions is multiplicative, but not necessarily completely multiplicative.

==Properties and examples==

In these formulas, we use the following arithmetical functions:
* formula_18 is the multiplicative identity: formula_19, otherwise 0 (formula_20).
* formula_21 is the constant function with value 1: formula_22 for all formula_23. Keep in mind that formula_21 is not the identity. (Some authors denote this as formula_25 because the associated Dirichlet series is the Riemann zeta function.)
* formula_26 for formula_27 is a set indicator function: formula_28 iff formula_29, otherwise 0.
*formula_30 is the identity function with value &quot;n&quot;: formula_31.
*formula_32 is the &quot;k&quot;th power function: formula_33.

The following relations hold:

* formula_34, the Dirichlet inverse of the constant function formula_21 is the Möbius function (see proof). Hence:
*formula_36 if and only if formula_37, the Möbius inversion formula
*formula_38, the kth-power-of-divisors sum function &quot;σ&quot;&quot;k&quot;
*formula_39, the sum-of-divisors function 
*formula_40 , the number-of-divisors function 
*formula_41,  by Möbius inversion of the formulas for &quot;σ&quot;&quot;k&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;, and &quot;τ&quot;
*formula_42
*formula_43

==Dirichlet inverse==

===Examples===

Given an arithmetic function formula_9 its Dirichlet inverse formula_65 may be calculated recursively: the value of formula_66 is in terms of formula_67 for formula_68.

For formula_69:
:formula_70, so
:formula_71. This implies that formula_9 does not have a Dirichlet inverse if formula_73.

For formula_74:
:formula_75,
:formula_76,

For formula_77:
: formula_78,
: formula_79,

For formula_80:
: formula_81,
: formula_82,

and in general for formula_83,

:formula_84

===Properties===

The following properties of the Dirichlet inverse hold:

* The function &quot;f&quot; has a Dirichlet inverse if and only if . 
* The Dirichlet inverse of a multiplicative function is again multiplicative. 
* The Dirichlet inverse of a Dirichlet convolution is the convolution of the inverses of each function: formula_85. 
* A multiplicative function &quot;f&quot; is completely multiplicative if and only if formula_86.
* If &quot;f&quot; is completely multiplicative then formula_87 whenever formula_88 and where formula_89 denotes pointwise multiplication of functions.

===Other formulas===

An exact, non-recursive formula for the Dirichlet inverse of any arithmetic function &quot;f&quot; is given in Divisor sum identities. A more partition theoretic expression for the Dirichlet inverse of &quot;f&quot; is given by 

:formula_90
The following formula provides a compact way of expressing the Dirichlet inverse of an invertible arithmetic function &quot;f&quot; :

formula_91

where the expression formula_92 stands for the arithmetic function formula_93 convoluted with itself &quot;k&quot; times. Notice that, for a fixed positive integer formula_23, if formula_95 then formula_96 , this is because formula_97 and every way of expressing &quot;n&quot; as a product of &quot;k&quot; positive integers must include a 1, so the series on the right hand side converges for every fixed positive integer &quot;n.&quot; 

==Dirichlet series==
If &quot;f&quot; is an arithmetic function, the Dirichlet series generating function is defined by

:formula_98

for those complex arguments &quot;s&quot; for which the series converges (if there are any). The multiplication of Dirichlet series is compatible with Dirichlet convolution in the following sense:

:formula_99

for all &quot;s&quot; for which both series of the left hand side converge, one of them at least converging 
absolutely (note that simple convergence of both series of the left hand side &quot;does not&quot; imply convergence of the right hand side!). This is akin to the convolution theorem if one thinks of Dirichlet series as a Fourier transform.

==Related concepts==

The restriction of the divisors in the convolution to unitary, bi-unitary or infinitary divisors defines similar commutative operations which share many features with the Dirichlet convolution (existence of a Möbius inversion, persistence of multiplicativity, definitions of totients, Euler-type product formulas over associated primes, etc.).

Dirichlet convolution is a special case of the convolution multiplication for the incidence algebra of a poset, in this case the poset of positive integers ordered by divisibility.

The Dirichlet hyperbola method computes the summation of a convolution in terms of its functions and their summation functions.

<text>Richard Ira &quot;Dick&quot; Bong (September 24, 1920 – August 6, 1945) was a United States Army Air Forces major and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. He was one of the most decorated American fighter pilots and the country&#x27;s top flying ace in the war, credited with shooting down 40 Japanese aircraft, all with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. He died in California while testing a Lockheed P-80 jet fighter shortly before the war ended. Bong was posthumously inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1986 and has several commemorative monuments named in his honor around the world, including an airport, two bridges, a theater, a veterans historical center, a recreation area, a neighborhood terrace, and several avenues and streets, including the street leading to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

==Early life==
Bong was born September 24, 1920, in Superior, Wisconsin, the first of nine children born to Carl Bong, an immigrant from Sweden, and Dora Bryce, who was an American of Scottish-English descent. Known by the common nickname &quot;Dick&quot;, he grew up on a farm in Poplar, Wisconsin, where he became interested in aircraft at an early age while watching planes fly over the farm carrying mail for President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s Summer White House in Superior, and was an avid model builder.

Bong entered Poplar High School in 1934, where he played the clarinet in the marching band and participated in baseball, basketball, and hockey. Because Poplar was a three-year school at the time, Bong transferred to Central High School in Superior for his senior year, graduating in 1938.

He began studying at Superior State Teachers College (the current-day University of Wisconsin–Superior) in 1938. While there, Bong enrolled in the Civilian Pilot Training Program and also took private flying lessons. On May 29, 1941, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps Aviation Cadet Program. One of his flight instructors was Captain Barry Goldwater (later a U.S. Senator from Arizona).

==United States Army Air Forces==
Bong&#x27;s ability as a fighter pilot was recognized while he was training in northern California. He was commissioned a second lieutenant and awarded his pilot wings on January 19, 1942. His first assignment was as an instructor (gunnery) pilot at Luke Field, Arizona, from January to May 1942. His first operational assignment was on May 6 to the 49th Fighter Squadron (FS), 14th Fighter Group at Hamilton Field, California, where he learned to fly the twin-engine Lockheed P-38 Lightning.

On June 12, 1942, Bong flew very low (&quot;buzzed&quot;) over a house in nearby San Anselmo, the home of a pilot who had just been married. He was cited and temporarily grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman&#x27;s clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, &quot;If you didn&#x27;t want to fly down Market Street, I wouldn&#x27;t have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say.&quot; Kenney later wrote, &quot;We needed kids like this lad.&quot; He also was made to do that woman&#x27;s laundry or any other chore. 

In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.

Bong was then flown overseas as a passenger aboard a B-24 Liberator from Hawaii via Hickam Field to Australia. Upon arrival Bong was assigned to a newly formed P-38 fighter unit, the 17th Fighter Squadron (Provisional). By November 1942, Bong was transferred to the 49th Fighter Group (49th FG), 9th Fighter Squadron (9th FS). &quot;The Flying Knights&quot; were flying the P-40 Warhawk, and were famous for their aerial defense of Darwin from March 1942 to August 1942. Afterward, the 9th Fighter Squadron was one of two units in the 5th Air Force selected for conversion to the P-38 Lightning. Bong was among a group of new pilots in the South-West Pacific Area (SWPA) with experience flying the new twin-engine fighter, and they helped these pilots convert from the P-40 Warhawk and P-39 Airacobra to the P-38 Lightning.

In November, while the squadron waited for delivery of the scarce P-38s, Bong and other 9th FS pilots were reassigned temporarily to fly missions and gain combat experience with the 39th Fighter Squadron, 35th Fighter Group, based in Port Moresby, New Guinea. On December 27, Bong claimed his initial aerial victory, shooting down a Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot;, and a Nakajima Ki-43 &quot;Oscar&quot; over Buna (during the Battle of Buna-Gona). For this action, Bong was awarded the Silver Star.
Bong rejoined the 9th FS, by then equipped with P-38s, in January 1943; the 49th FG was based at Schwimmer Field near Port Moresby. In April, he was promoted to first lieutenant. On July 26, Bong claimed four Japanese fighters over Lae, in an action that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross. In August, he was promoted to captain.

While on leave to the United States the following November and December, Bong met Marjorie Vattendahl at a Superior State Teachers College homecoming event and began dating her.

After returning to the southwest Pacific in January 1944, he named his P-38 &quot;Marge&quot; and adorned the nose with her photo. In March another pilot was flying Bong&#x27;s aircraft when it suffered engine failure and crashed in New Guinea, after the pilot, who survived, had bailed out. The approximate crash site is known, and the remains of the aircraft were to be searched for by the Richard I Bong Veterans Historical Center in Superior, Wisconsin and the WWII historical preservation group Pacific Wrecks in 2024. On May 24 of that year, the groups released a statement in which they announced that the crash site had been found with wreckage bearing the serial number of Bong&#x27;s aircraft. 

On April 12, Captain Bong shot down his 26th and 27th Japanese aircraft, surpassing Eddie Rickenbacker&#x27;s American record of 26 credited victories in World War I. Soon afterward, he was promoted to major by General Kenney and dispatched to the United States to see General &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, who gave him a leave.
After visiting training bases and going on a 15-state bond promotion tour, Bong returned to New Guinea in September. He was assigned to the V Fighter Command staff as an advanced gunnery instructor, with permission to go on missions but not to seek combat. Bong continued flying from Tacloban, Leyte, during the Philippines campaign; by December 17, he had increased his air-to-air victory claims to 40.

Bong considered his gunnery accuracy to be poor, so he compensated by getting as close to his targets as possible to make sure he hit them. In some cases he flew through the debris of exploding enemy aircraft, and on one occasion collided with his target, which he claimed as a &quot;probable&quot; victory.

On the recommendation of General Kenney, the Far East Air Force commander, Bong received the Medal of Honor from General Douglas MacArthur in a special ceremony in December 1944. Bong&#x27;s Medal of Honor citation says that he flew combat missions despite his status as an instructor, which was one of his duties as standardization officer for V Fighter Command. His rank of major qualified him for a squadron command, but he always flew as a flight (four-plane) or element (two-plane) leader.

In January 1945, Kenney sent Bong, America&#x27;s ace of aces home for good. Bong married Vattendahl on February 10, 1945. He participated in numerous public relations activities, such as promoting the sale of war bonds.

==Death==
Bong then became a test pilot assigned to Lockheed&#x27;s plant in Burbank, California, where he flew P-80 Shooting Star jet fighters at the Lockheed Air Terminal. On August 6, 1945, he took off to perform the acceptance flight of P-80A 44-85048. It was his 12th flight in the P-80; he had a total of four hours and fifteen minutes of flight time in the jet.

The plane&#x27;s primary fuel pump malfunctioned during takeoff. Bong did not switch to the auxiliary fuel pump, either forgetting or unable to do so. He ejected, but was too low for his parachute to open. The plane crashed into a narrow field at Oxnard Street and Satsuma Avenue, North Hollywood. His death was front-page news across the country, sharing space with the first news of the bombing of Hiroshima.
The I-16 auxiliary fuel pump had been added to P-80s after an earlier fatal crash. Captain Ray Crawford, a fellow P-80 test/acceptance flight pilot who flew on August 6, later said Bong had told him that he had forgotten to turn on the I-16 pump on an earlier flight.

In his autobiography, Chuck Yeager writes that part of the culture of test flying at the time, due to its fearsome mortality rates, was anger toward pilots who died in test flights, to avoid being overcome by sorrow for lost comrades. Bong&#x27;s brother Carl, who wrote his biography, questions whether Bong repeated the mistake so soon after mentioning it to another pilot. Carl&#x27;s book – &quot;Dear Mom, So We Have a War&quot; (1991) – contains numerous reports and findings from the crash investigations.

==Legacy==
In the mid-1950s, construction on a new USAF installation commenced south of Milwaukee that was to be named Richard I. Bong Air Force Base. The base, intended to be an Air Defense Command fighter base for the Chicago and Milwaukee areas, was conceived in the early 1950s with construction commencing in the mid-1950s. Construction had barely begun when the base was transferred to the Strategic Air Command as a prospective base for the supersonic B-58 Hustler bomber. Prior to completion, the base was considered obsolete as it had become apparent to USAF officials that the base would be redundant with installations nearby that would soon have space for more units. The base was abandoned in 1959 and disposed of the following year. Today, the former base site is known as the Richard Bong State Recreation Area.

It was planned that Spokane Air Force Base, Washington, was to be renamed Bong Air Force Base, until General Muir Fairchild died on active duty in 1950, and it was named Fairchild Air Force Base instead.

Bong is buried at Poplar Cemetery in Poplar, Wisconsin.

<text>Mary Katherine Fualaau (previously Letourneau, née Schmitz; January 30, 1962 – July 6, 2020) was an American teacher who pleaded guilty in 1997 to two counts of felony second-degree rape of a child and subsequently married her former student. The case received national attention.

Mary Schmitz met Steve Letourneau while attending Arizona State University; they had a child out of wedlock and married out of social pressure. They had three more children together over the years. Their marriage was unhappy. After achieving a teaching degree in 1989, Mary Letourneau started working at an elementary school in Burien, Washington. In September 1991, she first met Vili Fualaau, a second-grade pupil. Letourneau admired Fualaau&#x27;s artistic abilities and kept in touch while not being his teacher. Letourneau and Fualaau met again in the fall of 1995, in sixth grade class. In June 1996, Letourneau, aged 34, engaged in statutory rape with Fualaau, aged 12. In September, she found out she was pregnant with Fualaau&#x27;s child.

Mary Letourneau was arrested in March 1997, after a relative of her husband contacted the police. While awaiting sentencing, she gave birth to Fualaau&#x27;s daughter. With the state seeking a seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence, she reached a plea bargain calling for six months in jail with three months suspended and no contact with Fualaau for life, among other terms. Shortly after Letourneau had completed three months in jail, the police caught her in a car with Fualaau. A judge revoked her plea agreement and reinstated the prison sentence for the maximum allowed by law of seven-and-a-half years. Eight months after returning to prison, she gave birth to Fualaau&#x27;s second child, another daughter.

Letourneau was imprisoned from 1998 to 2004, spending half a year in solitary confinement for her communication attempts with Fualaau. After her release, she and Fualaau successfully petitioned to the court to have their no-contact order lifted. Mary Letourneau and Vili Fualaau were married in May 2005. The marriage lasted 14 years, until their separation in 2019. Letourneau died in 2020, aged 58, from colon cancer, leaving much of her estate to Fualaau.

== Early life ==
Mary Katherine Schmitz was born in 1962 in Tustin, California, to Mary E. ( Suehr), a former chemist, and John G. Schmitz (1930–2001), a community college instructor and politician. She was known as Mary Kay to her family. Letourneau was the third of seven children and the first daughter, raised in a &quot;strict Catholic household.&quot; 

When Mary Kay was two years old, her father began a political career, successfully running as a Republican for a seat in the state legislature. He held positions as a California state senator and U.S. Congressman, winning a special election for an unexpired term in 1970, and the general election later that year. After a primary defeat in 1972, he changed parties and ran for president as an American Independent Party candidate in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. In 1973, Philip Schmitz, one of Mary&#x27;s Kay&#x27;s brothers, drowned in the family pool at their home in the Spyglass Hill section of Corona del Mar, California, at the age of three while she was playing with another brother in the shallow end. While no one was held responsible for the toddler&#x27;s death, Mary Kay later claimed that the incident caused a rift between her and her mother as she said her parents tasked her with minding her brothers and her mother had become &quot;cold&quot; with her afterwards. 

Letourneau attended Cornelia Connelly High School, an all-girls&#x27; Catholic school in Anaheim, California, where she was a member of the cheerleading squad for Servite High School. She later attended Arizona State University.

In 1978, her father was re-elected as a Republican to the California State Senate. He intended to run for the U.S. Senate in 1982, but his political career was permanently damaged that year when it was revealed that he had fathered two children out of wedlock during an extramarital affair with a former student at Santa Ana College, where he had taught political science. Her father&#x27;s affair caused Letourneau&#x27;s parents to separate, but they later reconciled.

== First marriage ==
While attending Arizona State University (ASU), Mary Schmitz met fellow student Steve Letourneau. She later found out she was pregnant by him, which had led to complications one day in class when she had to be rushed to the emergency room. Doctors found that she had been carrying twins, but one embryo was lost to miscarriage. Mary Kay gave birth to the surviving twin, the first of the couple&#x27;s four children. She later said that she was not in love with Steve, but she married him after being urged to do so by her parents. Steve also lacked romantic feelings but was also pressured by his parents and willing to marry. Both Steve and Mary Kay dropped out of ASU. The couple moved to Anchorage, Alaska, where Steve found work as a baggage handler for Alaska Airlines. After a year in Alaska, Steve was transferred to Seattle, Washington, where Mary subsequently gave birth to their second child. Determined to get a career in education, Mary Kay enrolled in Seattle University and was awarded a teaching degree in 1989. She began teaching second grade at Shorewood Elementary School in the Seattle suburb of Burien.

The Letourneaus&#x27; marriage suffered. They had financial problems, and each party engaged in multiple extramarital affairs. Her attorney and former neighbor, David Gehrke, said that she was &quot;emotionally and physically abused by her husband&quot; during their marriage, and twice &quot;went to the hospital for treatment, and the police were called,&quot; although no charges were filed. In May 1999, they divorced while Mary was imprisoned, and Steve gained custody of their four children. In 2010, the Letourneaus became grandparents when their oldest son had a daughter.

== Crime, arrest, and sentencing ==
In September 1991, Letourneau first met Vili Fualaau (; born June 26, 1983), a child of Samoan descent, when he was her second-grade student at Shorewood Elementary School. She was reported to be a highly praised teacher by the students&#x27; parents. Letourneau described her view of Fualaau at that time as &quot;the kind of feeling you have with a brother or sister&quot;. In subsequent years, while not being his teacher, she reportedly continued to cultivate Fualaau&#x27;s artistic abilities. In the fall of 1995, Letourneau was once again Fualaau&#x27;s teacher, this time for sixth grade. In January 1996, Letourneau, aged 34, suffered a miscarriage in her marriage. During the summer, Fualaau spent time in Letourneau&#x27;s house to do schoolwork. &quot;People&quot; magazine reported Fualaau, aged 12, bet with a friend he would have sex with Letourneau and that she began fantasizing about him.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDBJ_4/4/2002&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;People_7/8/2020&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 1996, police found Letourneau with Fualaau in a car parked at a marina. She was seen jumping into the front seat while Fualaau pretended to sleep in the back. She and Fualaau provided false names when asked for identification, and Fualaau lied about his age, saying that he was 18. Fualaau said that no touching had taken place. Letourneau said she and her husband had gotten into an argument, and Fualaau, who she said was a family friend who had been staying with them that night, witnessed the argument and ran away, upset. She said she left to find him. Fualaau failed to furnish a driver&#x27;s license or any government-issued ID card, but the patrolman deduced he was not an adult as claimed. Letourneau and Fualaau were taken to the police station, where Fualaau&#x27;s mother was called. Mrs. Fualaau said that Mrs. Letourneau was a well-known teacher of Vili&#x27;s and had no issue with the two of them being in public. As such, the police dropped the matter. She later said that if the police had alerted her to the fact that Letourneau had lied about Fualaau&#x27;s age and what had occurred in the car, she would not have allowed her son to go back to Letourneau.

In September 1996, Letourneau was pregnant with Fualaau&#x27;s child. On February 1997, Steve Letourneau found love letters written from his wife to Fualaau. Mary Letourneau was arrested on March 4, 1997, after a relative of her husband contacted the police. Letourneau pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree child rape. Her first child with Fualaau, a daughter, was born on May 29, 1997, while she was awaiting sentencing. The state sought to sentence her to six-and-a-half years in prison. Through a plea agreement, her sentence was reduced to six months (three of which were suspended) in the county jail and three years of sex offender treatment. She was not required initially to register as a sex offender. As part of her plea agreement, Letourneau could not contact Fualaau or her five children or have contact with any other minors. She became the subject of an international tabloid scandal and experienced symptoms of degraded mental health.

On February 3, 1998, four weeks after completing her jail sentence, Letourneau was found by police in a car with Fualaau near her home. Letourneau initially said she was alone in the car. She and Fualaau provided false names when asked for identification. Although it was reported that sexual intercourse had occurred in the car, Fualaau told a detective that he and Letourneau had kissed, frequently, and he also reported that he had touched Letourneau on the thigh but that no sexual intercourse had occurred. There was evidence the two had met, several times, since Letourneau&#x27;s release from jail on January 2. When she was arrested, police found $6,200 in cash (), baby clothes, and her passport inside the car. Receipts for $850 in purchases () made since January 20 for men&#x27;s, young men&#x27;s, and infants&#x27; clothing were also found. Letourneau said that the money was for dermatology treatments and for her divorce lawyer and that some of the men&#x27;s clothing were gifts for relatives and for herself, since she enjoyed wearing oversized men&#x27;s clothing.

In February 1998, the judge revoked Letourneau&#x27;s prior plea agreement and reinstated the prison sentence of seven-and-a-half years for violating the no-contact order. In interviews and in a book on her involvement with Fualaau, Letourneau said she had sex with him in January. Police said they had no evidence that sex occurred in the February car incident. Letourneau served her sentence in the Washington Corrections Center for Women.

While serving her second stint in jail, Letourneau gave birth to her second daughter by Fualaau on October 16, 1998. That year, Letourneau and Fualaau co-authored a book, which was published in France, called &quot;Only One Crime, Love&quot; (). In 1999, a second book appeared, published in the United States, but it was written with only minimal cooperation from her and none from Fualaau: &quot;If Loving You Is Wrong&quot;. During her imprisonment, Letourneau was allowed visits from her children. When her father died in 2001 and Letourneau requested a furlough to attend his funeral at Fort Myer, Virginia, her request was rejected. While in prison, Letourneau tutored fellow inmates, created audio books for blind readers, participated in the prison choir, and &quot;rarely missed Mass.&quot; Because of her notoriety, Letourneau was unpopular with other inmates. She &quot;sassed guards and balked at work,&quot; and was reportedly punished with spending &quot;18 of her first 24 months&quot; in solitary confinement. In one instance, Letourneau served six months in solitary when letters she tried to send to Fualaau were intercepted. 

Fualaau dropped out of high school, and his mother was granted custody of his two children. He struggled with suicidal depression and alcoholism, attempting suicide in March 1999. In 2002, Fualaau&#x27;s family sued the Highline School District and the city of Des Moines, Washington, for emotional suffering, lost wages, and the costs of rearing his two children, claiming the school and the Des Moines Police Department had failed to protect him from Letourneau. Following a ten-week trial, no damages were awarded. Attorney Anne Bremner represented the Des Moines Police Department, while the Highline School District was represented by Michael Patterson.

== Release from prison and marriage to Fualaau ==
Letourneau was released from prison to a community placement program on August 4, 2004, and she registered the following day with the King County Sheriff&#x27;s Office as a lifetime level 2 (medium risk) sex offender.

Following Letourneau&#x27;s release, Fualaau, then aged 21, persuaded the court to reverse the no-contact order against her. Letourneau and Fualaau married on May 20, 2005, in the city of Woodinville, Washington, in a ceremony at the Columbia Winery. Exclusive access to the wedding was given to the television show &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, and photographs were released through other media outlets. Letourneau said she planned to have another child and return to the teaching profession. She indicated that by law, she was permitted to teach at private schools and community colleges.

Attorney Anne Bremner, who met and befriended Letourneau in 2002, during Fualaau&#x27;s civil suit, said that Letourneau considered her relationship with Fualaau to be &quot;eternal and endless.&quot; According to Bremner, &quot;nothing could have kept the two of them apart.&quot; In a 2006 interview with NBC News, Letourneau &quot;conceded she knew it would be wrong to let the relationship go any further, but she said as soon as the school year ended, she and Vili did cross that line.&quot; She said that &quot;it did not cross her mind,&quot; at the time, that having sex with Fualaau would be a crime. In a later interview, she stated, &quot;If someone had told me, if anyone had told me, there is a specific law that says this is a crime, I did not know. I&#x27;ve said this, over and over again. Had I&#x27;d known, if anyone knows my personality. Just the idea, this would count as a crime.&quot; The television series &quot;Barbara Walters Presents American Scandals&quot; covered the case in December 2015 with an interview to discuss the couple&#x27;s relationship and their two daughters.

On May 9, 2017, after almost 12 years of marriage, Fualaau filed for separation from Letourneau, but he later withdrew the filing.

As of April 2018, Fualaau was working at a home improvement store and as a professional DJ, while Letourneau was working as a legal assistant. An article in &quot;People&quot; quoted an inside source who said, &quot;They know what everyone thinks about their relationship, and they don&#x27;t care. They really never have. The wrong stuff that happened was so long ago. They are two grown adults who are living their lives now.&quot;

The couple finalized a legal separation in August 2019. Earlier in the marriage, Fualaau said he was not a victim, and he was unashamed of the relationship. According to &quot;People&quot; in May 2020, an unnamed source &quot;close to Fualaau&quot; said that &quot;he sees things clearly now, and he realizes that this wasn&#x27;t a healthy relationship, from the start.&quot;

== Death ==
Letourneau died July 6, 2020, at her home in Des Moines, Washington, from colon cancer. She was 58. Fualaau and her family were at her side, despite their separation. A joint statement was made by the Fualaau and Letourneau families to commemorate her passing. In her will, Letourneau left much of her estate to Fualaau.

<text>Chatham-Kent (2021 population: 103,988) is a single-tier municipality in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is mostly rural, and its population centres are Chatham, Wallaceburg, Tilbury, Blenheim, Ridgetown, Wheatley and Dresden. The current Municipality of Chatham-Kent was created in 1998 by the amalgamation of Blenheim, Bothwell, Camden, the City of Chatham, the Township of Chatham, Dover, Dresden, Erie Beach, Erieau, Harwich, Highgate, Howard, Orford, Raleigh, Ridgetown, Romney, Thamesville, Tilbury East, Tilbury, Wallaceburg, Wheatley and Zone.

The Chatham-Kent census division, which includes the independent Delaware Nation at Moraviantown First Nation, had a population of 104,316 in the 2021 census.

==History ==
The area of Chatham-Kent is part of the traditional territory of the Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe and Wyandot First Nations of Canada. After the Treaty of Paris in 1763 ceded control of the area from the French to the British, it became part of the Territory of Quebec. The title to the Chatham-Kent area was surrendered to the British as part of the 1790 McKee&#x27;s Purchase, (named for Alexander McKee) to provide land for settlers. McKee&#x27;s Purchase was designated an Event of National Historic Significance in Canada in 1931. A historical plaque for the purchase is located in Blenheim Park in Blenheim. Indigenous persons remain resident in the area today at the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown and Walpole Island First Nation.

European settlement of the former city of Chatham area began with a naval dockyard in 1792, at the fork of the Thames River with McGregor&#x27;s Creek. The town was named after William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. It was built as a naval dockyard, a characteristic shared by Chatham, Kent, England. In England, the name Chatham came from the British root &quot;ceto&quot; and the Old English &quot;ham&quot; thus meaning a forest settlement. Following the American Revolution and the Gnadenhutten massacre, a group of Christian Munsee settled in what is now the Moraviantown reserve. In the War of 1812, the Battle of the Thames took place between Moraviantown and Thamesville on October 5, 1813.

===Black population===
During the 19th century, the area was the northern terminus of the Underground Railroad. As a result, Chatham-Kent is now part of the African-Canadian Heritage Tour. Josiah Henson Museum for African-Canadian History, formally known as Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin Historic Site is a museum of the Dawn Settlement, established in 1841 by Josiah Henson near Dresden as refuge for the many slaves who escaped to Canada from the United States. John Brown, the abolitionist, planned his raid on the Harpers Ferry Arsenal in Chatham and recruited local men to participate in the raid. He held in Chatham a Convention of Colored Men on May 8–10, 1858. The small village of North Buxton, part of the African Canadian Heritage Tour, also played an important role in the Underground Railroad. By the 1850s, the city of Chatham was referred to as the &quot;black mecca of Canada&quot;. A museum in the city, the Black Mecca Museum, still bears this name. Chatham was home to a number of black churches and business, with Black Canadians making up one-third of the city&#x27;s population and controlling a significant portion of the city&#x27;s political power. Nearby Dresden and Buxton were also home to thousands of land-owning black residents. However, after the abolition of slavery in the United States, many black families left the area. Today the city of Chatham is just 3.3% black, with Chatham-Kent as a whole being 2.1% black. Few of the black-owned institutions are still in operation.

===After slavery ended in the United States===
In 1846, the town of Chatham had a population of about 1,500, with part of the town being called Chatham North. There were four churches, a theatre, a weekly newspaper and a cricket club. The road between London and Amherstburg was open, and transportation by stagecoach was available. A fast boat also provided transportation to Detroit and Buffalo. Chatham had many tradesman, a foundry, two banks, three schools, a tavern and a library where one could read books and newspapers. By 1869, the population was 3,000 in this industrial area with several mills, foundries, and breweries; a great deal of wood was being produced. A steamboat offered transportation to Windsor and Detroit. There was one bank office.

Between 1906 and 1909, the city was home to the Chatham Motor Car Company, and from 1919 to 1921, Denby Motor Truck Company of Canada. It was also where the Hyslop and Ronald steam fire engine manufacturer was located; the factory would be taken over by Chatham Motor Car. In addition, it hosted meat packer O&#x27;Keefe and Drew.

The Hawaiian pizza is claimed to have been invented in Chatham in 1962 at the Satellite Restaurant by Sam Panopoulos. In the U.S., former Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes proposed building a bridge across Lake Erie linking Cleveland to the southern coast of Kent County.

Before 1998, Kent County consisted of the townships of Camden, Chatham, Dover, Harwich, Howard, Orford, Raleigh, Romney, Tilbury East and Zone. In some of Canada&#x27;s earliest post-Confederation censuses, some residences in Kent County were incorrectly reported as being in Bothwell &quot;County&quot;, which was a separate electoral district comprising parts of Kent and Lambton counties but not a distinct county in its own right.

In 1998, the County of Kent and the city of Chatham were amalgamated by the Province of Ontario to form the Municipality of Chatham–Kent. Most services were also combined. Since then, bus service has begun to serve all of Chatham-Kent. Starting in 2007, routes were set up to include the former towns of Wallaceburg and Dresden. Before 1998, each town had their own fire department. It then became the Chatham-Kent Fire Department upon amalgamation. The county also had separate police departments until 1998. The city of Chatham, as well as the towns of Wallaceburg, Dresden, and Tilbury, each had their own departments. The Chatham-Kent Police Service was formed on September 1, 1998. Many residents opposed amalgamation, as 18 city councillors boycotted the official vote, and the final decision to amalgamate was imposed on the County by a provincial commissioner. In a study on amalgamations in Ontario from 2003, 48% of respondents in Chatham-Kent felt the value they received as taxpayers became worse after amalgamation, and 64% of respondents still did not think of the community as &quot;the Municipality of Chatham-Kent.&quot;

Chatham-Kent has many historic festivals throughout the year, such as the Battle of Longwoods reenactment, which takes place on Labour Day weekend at Fairfield Museum on Longwoods Road. Chatham Kent is also home to many historic buildings which are part of an annual ghost tour offered each year at Halloween. The participants go on a guided walk of downtown while the guide informs them of various ghost stories tied to the local buildings in which they pass. Chatham-Kent was a major part of the Underground Railroad and as such hosts the Buxton Homecoming each September. This celebrates the area&#x27;s black culture and the roots laid by early black settlers in the Buxton area.

<text>Dryden is the second-largest city in the Kenora District of northwestern Ontario, Canada, located on Wabigoon Lake. It is the least populous community in Ontario incorporated as a city. The City of Dryden had a population of 7,388 and its population centre (urban area) had a population of 5,355 in 2021.

Dryden was incorporated as a town in 1910 and as a city in 1998. The main industries in Dryden include manufacturing (particularly pulp and paper), renewable energy (including bioenergy and solar energy), and service. Dryden is located on Ontario&#x27;s Highway 17, which forms part of the Trans-Canada Highway. It is situated halfway between the larger cities of Winnipeg and Thunder Bay.

==History==

Before settlement by Europeans, the Dryden area was inhabited by the Anishinaabe. They used the shore by the Wabigoon River as a camping site, calling it Paawidigong (&quot;the place of rapids&quot; in Ojibwe). The settlement was founded as an agricultural community by John Dryden, Ontario&#x27;s Minister of Agriculture in 1895. While his train was stopped at what was then known as Barclay Tank to re-water, he noticed clover growing and decided to found an experimental farm the following year. The farm&#x27;s success brought settlers from southern Ontario and the community came to be known as New Prospect. In 1886, gold was discovered near the area, also attracting people. In 1897, the community was renamed to Dryden to honour the minister of agriculture. It incorporated as a town in 1910 and as a city in 1998 after merging with the neighbouring township of Barclay.

One of the earliest industries in the area was pulp and paper. A paper mill was built in the town in 1910 because of the abundance of wood suitable for kraft pulping as well as energy from the Wabigoon River. The town came into national consciousness because of mercury contamination. In the 1970s, it became known that the Dryden pulp and paper operations discharged ten tons of mercury directly into the Wabigoon River over a span of eight years. The mercury caused persistent environmental damage, poisoned river systems and lakes, and led to members of the Grassy Narrows community suffering severe mercury poisoning known as Minamata disease.

The town was also the site of the March 10, 1989 crash of Air Ontario Flight 1363 from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg, which killed 24 people.

<text>Standard High German (SHG), less precisely Standard German or High German (, , or, in Switzerland, ), is the umbrella term for the standardized varieties of the German language, which are used in formal contexts and for communication between different dialect areas. German is a pluricentric Dachsprache with currently three codified (or standardised) specific national varieties: German Standard German, Austrian Standard German and Swiss Standard German.

Regarding the spelling and punctuation, a recommended standard is published by the Council for German Orthography which represents the governments of all majority and minority German-speaking countries and dependencies. Adherence is obligatory for government institutions, including schools. Although there is no official standards body regulating pronunciation, there is a long-standing &quot;de facto&quot; standard pronunciation (Bühnendeutsch), most commonly used in formal speech and teaching materials; it is similar to the formal German spoken in and around Hanover. Adherence to those standards by private individuals and companies, including the print and audio-visual media, is voluntary. Austrian German has had standard pronunciation exceptions since 1904 (Luick&#x27;s österreichische Bühnenaussprache). In Switzerland, no such official pronunciation codex exists, yet most Standard Swiss German speakers are markedly different sounding from Hanover-type phonetic targets.

== Origins ==
Standard German originated not as a traditional dialect of a specific region but as a written language developed over a process of several hundred years in which writers tried to write in a way that was understood in the largest area.

Martin Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible in 1522 (New Testament, Old Testament 1534) was an important development towards an early standardization of written German. Luther based his translation largely on the already developed language of the Saxon chancery, which was more widely understood than other dialects and as a Central German dialect, was felt to be &quot;halfway&quot; between the dialects of the north and south. Luther drew principally on Eastern Upper and East Central German dialects and preserved much of the grammatical system of Middle High German.

Later in 1748, a grammar manual by Johann Christoph Gottsched, &quot;Grundlegung einer deutschen Sprachkunst&quot;, was key in the development of German writing and standardization of the language. Similarly to Luther, Gottsched based his manual on the Central German variant of the Upper Saxon area. Over the course of the mid-18th century and onward, a written standard then began to emerge and be widely accepted in German-speaking areas, thus ending the period of Early New High German.

Until about 1800, Standard German was almost entirely a written language. People in Northern Germany who spoke mainly Low Saxon dialects, which were very different from Standard German, learned it more or less as a foreign language. However, the Northern pronunciation (of Standard German) later became considered standard and spread southward. In some regions such as around Hanover, the local dialect has completely died out as spoken language but is preserved in dialect literature and scholarly descriptions.

It can thus be argued that it is the spread of Standard German as a language taught at school that defines the German &quot;Sprachraum&quot;, which was thus a political decision, rather than a direct consequence of dialect geography. That allowed areas with dialects with very little mutual intelligibility to participate in the same cultural sphere. Some linguists claim today that a One Standard German Axiom is a defining feature of Germanistik. Outside of Switzerland, Austria and South Tyrol, local dialects tend to be used mainly in informal situations or at home and in dialect literature, but more recently, a resurgence of German dialects has appeared in mass media.

== Terminology ==
In German, Standard German is generally called , reflecting the fact that its phonetics are largely those of the High German spoken in the southern uplands and the Alps (including Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and parts of northern Italy as well as southern Germany). The corresponding term Low German reflects the fact that these dialects belong to the lowlands stretching towards the North Sea. The widespread but mistaken impression that Hochdeutsch is so-called because it is perceived to be &quot;good German&quot; has led to use of the supposedly less judgmental (&quot;Standard German&quot;), (&quot;German standard language&quot;). On the other hand, the &quot;standard&quot; written languages of Switzerland and Austria have each been codified as standards distinct from that used in Germany. For this reason, &quot;Hochdeutsch&quot; or &quot;High German&quot;, originally a mere geographic designation, applies unproblematically to Swiss Standard German and Austrian German as well as to German Standard German and may be preferred for that reason.

== Pluricentricity ==

Since the 1980s, German has widely been considered a pluricentric language with the national standard varieties of German Standard German, Austrian Standard German and Swiss Standard German. These varieties of standard German differ above all in vocabulary, pragmatics and pronunciation, but in some instances also in grammar and, in only a handful of cases, in orthography. In formal writing, the differences are small; in regards to the spoken language, the different varieties of Standard German are easily recognized by most speakers.

These three national standards (German, Austrian and Swiss) have each been adopted by other German-speaking countries and communities as their standard form of German. The German standard is applied in Luxembourg, Belgium, and Namibia while the Swiss standard has been adopted in Liechtenstein.

The variation of the Standard German varieties must not be confused with the variation of the local German dialects. Even though the Standard German varieties are to a certain degree influenced by the local dialects, they are very distinct. All varieties of Standard German are based on the common tradition of the written German language, whereas the local dialects have their own historical roots that go further back than the unification of the written language, and in the case of Low German, belong to a different language entirely.

== Continuum between Standard German and German dialects ==
In most regions, the speakers use a continuum of mixtures from more dialectal varieties to more standard varieties according to situation. However, there are two (or three) exceptions:

* In Northern Germany, there is no continuum in the strict sense between the local varieties of Low German (&quot;Plattdeutsch&quot;) on one hand and Standard German on the other. Since the former have not undergone the High German consonant shift, they are too different from the standard for a continuum to emerge. High German and Low German are best seen as separate languages, but because High (Middle and Upper) and Low German form a dialect continuum and Standard German serves as &quot;Dachsprache&quot; for all forms of German, they are often described as dialects of German. Under a sociolinguistic approach to the problem, even if Low German dialects are &quot;Abstandsprachen&quot; (linguistically quite different), they are perceived as dialects of German because they lack &quot;Ausbau&quot;. However, Low German influenced the standard-based vernaculars that are spoken today in Northern Germany by language transfer in pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, and it continues to do so to a limited degree. High German that is heavily influenced by Low German has been known as Missingsch, but most contemporary Northern Germans exhibit only an intermediate Low German substratum in their speech.
* In German-speaking Switzerland, there is no such continuum between the Swiss German varieties and Swiss Standard German, and the use of Standard German is almost entirely restricted to the written language. Therefore, the situation has been called a &quot;medial diglossia&quot;. Standard German is seldom spoken among native Swiss, and even then the accent and vocabulary is very much Swiss except, for instance, when speaking with people who do not understand the Swiss German dialects at all, and it is expected to be used in school. Standard German has, however, left a clear imprint on the contemporary variants of Swiss German, regional expressions and vocabulary having been replaced with material assimilated from the standard language. Of all German-speaking countries, Switzerland has, however, the most fully retained the use of dialect in everyday situations. Dialect is used to a lesser extent for some everyday situations in southern Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein, Alsace, and South Tyrol. The regular use of dialect in the Swiss media (radio, internet, and television) contrasts with its much rarer appearance in the media of Austria, Germany, East Belgium, South Tyrol, and Liechtenstein.
* Luxembourgish was considered a German dialect like many others until about World War II but then underwent ausbau. It created its own standard form in vocabulary, grammar and spelling and therefore is seen today as an independent language. Since Luxembourgish has a maximum of some 600,000 native speakers, resources in the language (books, newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc.) are limited. Since most Luxembourgers also speak Standard German and French, there is strong competition with both, which have very large language resources. Luxembourgers are generally trilingual and use French and Standard German in some areas of life, Luxembourgish in others. Standard German is taught in the schools in Luxembourg, and close to 90% of the population can speak it.

== Phonology ==

While the three principal national varieties are recognized as three distinct standards, the differences are few, perhaps comparable to the difference between British and American English. The pronouncing dictionary of the Duden dictionary group codifies the standard pronunciation for German Standard German and allows for a small number of divergences; for example, the string &quot;äh&quot; has two authorized pronunciations, /ɛː/ and /eː/. Some regions see only the first as correct, and others use only the second; Duden now recognizes both as correct. Standardized High German pronunciation is generally used in radio and television as well as in German learning materials for non-natives and at least aspirationally by language teachers. The accent is documented in reference works such as &quot;Deutsches Aussprachewörterbuch&quot; (German Pronunciation Dictionary) by Eva-Maria Krech et al., &quot;Duden 6 Das Aussprachewörterbuch&quot; (Duden volume 6, The Pronunciation Dictionary) by Max Mangold and the training materials at the &quot;Westdeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (West German Broadcasting) and &quot;Deutschlandfunk&quot; (Radio Germany). It is an invented accent, rather than one radiating from any particular German-speaking city. It is often said that the people of Hannover speak German with an accent that comes closest to the standard of the Duden dictionaries, but the claim is debatable, particularly since it may apply equally well to the rest of Northern Germany. 

== Grammar ==
== Orthography ==
=== Features ===

Standard High German is written in the Latin alphabet. In addition to the 26 standard letters, German has three vowels with an umlaut mark, namely &quot;ä&quot;, &quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ü&quot;, as well as the or (sharp s): &quot;ß&quot;. In Switzerland and Liechtenstein, &quot;ss&quot; is used instead of &quot;ß&quot;.

=== History ===

A first step to standardisation, although non-prescriptive, of Early New High German was introduced by the Luther Bible of 1534. In consequence, the written language of the chancery of Saxony-Wittenberg rose in importance in the course of the 17th century so much so that it was used in texts such as the 1665 revision of the Zürich Bible.

The First Orthographical Conference convened in 1876 by order of the government of Prussia, but failed. Konrad Duden published the first edition of his dictionary, later simply known as the &quot;Duden&quot;, in 1880. The first spelling codification by the Second Orthographic Conference of 1901, based on Duden&#x27;s work, came into effect in 1902.

In 1944 there was a failed attempt at another reform; this was delayed on the order of Hitler and not taken up again after the end of World War II.

In the following decades German spelling was essentially decided &quot;de facto&quot; by the editors of the Duden dictionaries. After the war, this tradition was followed with two different centers: Mannheim in West Germany and Leipzig in East Germany. By the early 1950s, a few other publishing houses had begun to attack the Duden monopoly in the West by publishing their own dictionaries, which did not always conform to the &quot;official&quot; spellings prescribed by Duden. In response, the Ministers of Culture of the federal states in West Germany officially declared the Duden spellings to be binding as of November 1955 (&quot;Duden-Monopol&quot; or &quot;Dudenmonopol&quot;, &quot;Duden-Privileg&quot; or &quot;Dudenprivileg&quot;). 

==== Orthography Reform of 1996 ====
The orthography reform of 1996 was based on an international agreement signed by the governments of the German-speaking countries Germany, Austria, Liechtenstein and Switzerland; but acceptance of the reform was limited and led to public controversy and considerable dispute. The states () of North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria refused to accept it. At one point, the dispute reached the highest court, which quickly dismissed it, claiming that the states had to decide for themselves and that only in schools could the reform be made the official rule – everybody else could continue writing as they had learned it.

While, , most German print media followed the reform, some newspapers, such as , &#x27; and &#x27;, created their own in-house orthographies.

After 10 years, without any intervention by the federal parliament, a major revision of the spelling reform was installed in 2006 because there were disagreements regarding capitalization and splitting of German words. Also revised were the rules governing punctuation marks.

The most noticeable change was probably in the use of the letter &quot;ß&quot;, called &quot;scharfes s&quot; (&quot;Sharp S&quot;) or (pronounced &quot;ess-tsett&quot;, coming from ſz). Traditionally, this letter was used in three situations:

# After a long vowel or vowel combination;
# Before a &quot;t&quot;;
# At the end of a syllable.

Examples are , , and . Currently, only the first rule is in effect, making the reformed spellings , , and . The word &#x27;foot&#x27; has the letter &quot;ß&quot; because it contains a long vowel, even though that letter occurs at the end of a syllable. The logic of this change is that an &#x27;ß&#x27; is a single letter whereas &#x27;ss&#x27; are two letters, so the same distinction applies as (for example) between the words and .

==English to Standard German cognates==
This is a selection of cognates in both English and Standard German. Instead of the usual infinitive ending &quot;-en&quot;, Standard German verbs are indicated by a hyphen after their stems. Words that are written with capital letters in Standard German are nouns.

==Loanwords from Standard German to English==
English has taken many loanwords from German, often without any change of spelling (aside from frequently eliminating umlauts and not capitalizing nouns):
==Dictionaries==

The Duden is the &quot;de facto&quot; official dictionary of the Standard High German language, first published by Konrad Duden in 1880. The Duden is updated regularly, with new editions appearing every four or five years. , it was in its 27th edition and in 12 volumes, each covering different aspects such as loanwords, etymology, pronunciation, synonyms, and so forth.The first of these volumes, (German Orthography), has long been the prescriptive source for the spelling of Standard High German. The &quot;Duden&quot; had become the bible of the Standard High German language, being the definitive set of rules regarding grammar, spelling, and usage of Standard High German.
The (&quot;Austrian Dictionary&quot;), abbreviated , is the official dictionary of the Standard High German language in the Republic of Austria. It is edited by a group of linguists under the authority of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture (). It is the Austrian counterpart to the German &quot;Duden&quot; and contains a number of terms unique to Austrian German or more frequently used or differently pronounced there. A considerable amount of this &quot;Austrian&quot; vocabulary is also common in Southern Germany, especially Bavaria, and some of it is used in Switzerland as well. Since the 39th edition in 2001 the orthography of the has been adjusted to the German spelling reform of 1996. The dictionary is also officially used in the Italian province of South Tyrol. It is currently available in 44th edition, from 2022, and includes an online version with limited access.

==Organisations==
Several organisations promote the use and learning of the Standard German language.

===Goethe Institut===
The government-backed , (named after Johann Wolfgang von Goethe) aims to enhance the knowledge of German culture and language within Europe and the rest of the world. This is done by holding exhibitions and conferences with German-related themes, and providing training and guidance in the learning and use of the German language. For example, the teaches the German language qualification.

===Deutsche Welle===
The German state broadcaster provides radio and television broadcasts in Standard German and 30 other languages across the globe. Its Standard German language services are spoken slowly and thus tailored for learners. also provides an website for learning Standard German.

<doc id="179033" wikidata="Q2729034" url="?curid=179033" title="Elliot Lake">
<text>Elliot Lake is a city in Algoma District, Ontario, Canada. It is north of Lake Huron, midway between the cities of Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie in the Northern Ontario region. Once dubbed the &quot;uranium capital of the world,&quot; Elliot Lake has since diversified to a hub for advanced manufacturing, forest harvesting, mine reclamation expertise, retirement living, all-season tourism and remote work.

==History==
Prior to the settlement of the city, a seasonal Ojibwa village extended along the lake&#x27;s shoreline near the present hospital.

The town takes its name from the lake. There is no official record of origin of name; the earliest appearance is on the Dominion map of 1901. Folklore suggest it was named for a logging camp cook who drowned in the lake. The townsite name was approved on August 14, 1952. Elliot Lake was incorporated as a city in 1990.

===Uranium mining===

The city was established as a planned community for the mining industry in 1955 after the discovery of uranium in the area, and named after the small lake on its northern edge. By the late 1950s, its population had grown to about 25,000. It was originally incorporated as an improvement district. Geologist Franc Joubin and American financier Joseph Hirshhorn were instrumental in its founding. The principal mining companies were Denison Mines and Rio Algom. The population has varied with several boom-and-bust cycles from the 1950s to the 1990s, from a high of over 26,000 to a low of about 6,600.

By 1958 it was apparent that world production of uranium was far outstripping demand and Canadian producers received unofficial notice that US options on Canadian uranium production between 1962 and 1966 would not be exercised. This was confirmed in 1959.

During the 1970s, federal plans for CANDU Reactors and Ontario Hydro&#x27;s interest in atomic energy led the town, anticipating a population of 30,000, to expand again. However, by the early 1990s depleted reserves and low prices caused the last mines in the area to close.

====Area uranium mines====
* Stanleigh Mine (1956–1960 and 1982–1997), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 14 million tons of ore.
* Spanish American Mine (1957–1959), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 79,000 tons of ore.
* Can-Met Mine (1957–1960), operated by Denison Mines Ltd., produced 2.6 million tons of ore.
* Milliken Mine (1957–1964), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 6.3 million tons of ore.
* Panel Mine (1957–1961 and 1978–1990), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 15 million tons of ore.
* Denison Mine (1957–1992), operated by Denison Mines Ltd., produced 69 million tons of ore.
* Stanrock Mine (1958–1960 and 1964–1985), operated by Denison Mines Ltd., produced 6.4 million tons of ore.
* Quirke Mine(s) (1955–1961 and 1965–1990), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 44 million tons of ore.
* Pronto Mine (1955–1970), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 2.3 million tons of ore.
* Buckles Mine (1956–1960), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 276,000 tons of ore.
* Lacnor Mine &quot;Lake Nordic&quot; (1956–1960), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 3.4 million tons of ore.
* Nordic Mine (1956–1970), operated by Rio Algom Ltd., produced 13 million tons of ore

====Mining legacy health and environmental concerns====

In 1974, after growing concern from uranium miners about lung cancer and a lack of support from mine owners for sick workers, 1,000 uranium miners staged a wildcat strike. The 14-day strike triggered a chain of events that led to the creation of a Royal Commission on the Health and Safety of Workers in Mines (informally known as the Ham Commission) which subsequently led to the creation of the Canada&#x27;s &quot;Occupational Health and Safety Act&quot; of 1979.

According to University of Toronto history professor Laurel Sefton MacDowell in her 2012 article &#x27;The Elliot Lake Uranium Miners’ Battle to Gain Occupational Health and Safety Improvements, 1950–1980&#x27;, the health concerns over radiation in the local environment are perpetual, and must be monitored perpetually.

The 2017 performance of Rio Algom Limited (a subsidiary of BHP), who own nine of the decommissioned mines, was described as &quot;below expectations&quot; by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission reported radium releases above limits at the Stanleigh effluent treatment plant, prompting engineering work plus increased site monitoring by the owners.

===Post-mining===
In the years following the cessation of mining, the city looked elsewhere for its survival, finding some success promoting itself as a retirement community, advanced manufacturing hub and tourist destination.

On June 23, 2012, part of a roof collapsed at Algo Centre Mall, sending metal and concrete debris crashing down through two floors of the shopping centre. The accident killed two people. Pearson Plaza has since opened.

On February 21, 2019, part of the theatre roof of the Lester B. Pearson Civic Centre collapsed due to an abnormally heavy snow load. The building has since been completely demolished.

Today, the economy of Elliot Lake has seen steady growth. Major employers in Elliot Lake include major mining services firms such as Komatsu, Weir, and Denison Environmental; specialty manufacturing organizations such as St. Regis Group, HiRail Leasing and Prestige Pulpits; numerous forestry businesses; a collection of professional services offices such as Cambridge Law LLP, KPMG and BrokerLink and an increasing number of technology organizations. Government organizations found in the community are numerous and include the City of Elliot Lake, Elliot Lake Retirement Living, a range of Ontario Ministries, a set of federal government offices, a hospital, many health service providers and several schools.

The city has four major retail areas: Downtown, Highway 108 Corridor, Hillside, and Paris; and two industrial parks, located at north and south ends of the City. The new mall is Pearson Plaza, and opened downtown in 2016.

In January 2023, just weeks after being elected in the 2022 Algoma District municipal elections, mayor Chris Patrie was removed from office in a ruling that he had violated municipal conflict of interest rules by lobbying, in his prior term as a city councillor, to have the city&#x27;s new recreation centre built near the Oakland Plaza, in which he is a part owner, instead of on the former Algo Centre Mall site. Deputy mayor Andrew Wannan served as acting mayor, while Patrie appealed the ruling. Patrie lost his appeal, and Wannan was elevated to the full mayoralty by the city council in February 2024.

==Geography and environment==

Situated on the Canadian Shield, the city is surrounded by dense forest, muskeg swamps, numerous lakes, winding rivers, and hills of Precambrian bedrock. The local forests are mixed deciduous and coniferous, with colourful displays in the autumn.

Local wildlife include moose, white-tailed deer, American black bear, beaver, loon, muskrat, otter, Canada goose, and lynx, to name but a few. Fish species include lake trout, speckled trout, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, pickerel (walleye), and sturgeon.

Since December 1990 the town has been home to the Elliot Lake Research Field Station, established by Laurentian University to investigate environmental radioactivity.

Acclaimed Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky has taken landscape pictures of uranium and nickel tailings during the mid-1990s, providing evidence of the after-effects to the ecosystem.

===Climate===
Elliot Lake has a humid continental climate (Dfb). Summers are warm and rainy with cool nights. Winters are long and very cold with extremely heavy snowfall. Precipitation is very heavy year round for such a cold location.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Elliot Lake had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Politics==
===Federal and provincial representation===
The city is part of the federal electoral district of Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing, currently represented in the Canadian House of Commons by Carol Hughes, and the provincial electoral district of Algoma—Manitoulin, currently represented in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by Mike Mantha.

In the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, it was redistricted into the new riding of Manitoulin—Nickel Belt.

===Municipal government===
From its establishment in 1955 until 1966, Elliot Lake was governed as an improvement district, a type of local government committee (no longer used in Ontario) to oversee developing communities that need some form of administration but have not yet met the criteria necessary to be formally incorporated as a town. It was incorporated as a town in 1966, and reincorporated as a city in 1990.

As an improvement district, the city was chaired by the following:
* F. R. Joubin - 1955-1957
* R. C. Hart - 1957-1961
* Edward Futterer - 1961-1966

Its reeves and mayors since incorporation have been:
* Charles Stewart - 1966-1968
* Alcide Alemany - 1968-1970
* Roger Taylor - 1970-1988
* George Farkouh - 1988-2006
* Rick Hamilton - 2006-2014
* Dan Marchisella - 2014-2022
* Chris Patrie - 2022-2023
* Andrew Wannan - 2024-present

==Transportation==

Relatively isolated, Elliot Lake is connected to the south only by Highway 108, a 30 km distance to Highway 17, also known as the Trans-Canada Highway. North of the city, Highway 639 extends for 24 kilometres to its terminus at Highway 546, an almost entirely unpopulated route used primarily as an access road to Mississagi Provincial Park and a few private wilderness recreation lodges. The Deer Trail Route, a part of the Ontario Tourist Route network, follows a circle consisting of Highways 17, 108, 639 and 546.

A 1991 study by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation proposed the extension of Highway 555 (Granary Lake Road) from Blind River to meet Spine Road in Elliot Lake, creating a new route which would reduce the length of a commute between the two communities by approximately 20 kilometres. Although the ministry has announced no firm plans to construct the proposed road, Elliot Lake City Council passed a motion in August 2015 calling for the project&#x27;s revival.

As a general aviation facility Elliot Lake Municipal Airport has no regularly scheduled flights. The closest scheduled airport with flights are located in Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie.

Elliot Lake Transit provides hourly bus service except on Sundays and statutory holidays.

Intercity motor coach service is provided by Ontario Northland.

==Arts and culture==
Local festivals include the Jewel in the Wilderness Festival, Heritage Weekend and the Elliot Lake Arts on the Trail festival.

The city is home to Denison House, a hotel and convention facility located in the former corporate lodge of Denison Mines, and the Elliot Lake Mining and Nuclear Museum. Two community monuments, the Uranium Atom Monument downtown and the Miners Memorial Monument on Horne Lake, are also found in the city, as well as a scenic lookout at the former fire tower.

In 1975, Canadian musician Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors recorded &quot;Damn Good Song for a Miner,&quot; about the city of Elliot Lake and its mining culture in the 1960s. Elliot Lake is also a prominent setting in Alistair MacLeod&#x27;s award-winning novel &quot;No Great Mischief&quot;.

<text>Kenora (), previously named Rat Portage (), is a city situated on the Lake of the Woods in Ontario, Canada, close to the Manitoba boundary, and about east of Winnipeg by road. It is the seat of Kenora District.

The history of the name extends beyond the time of French settlers arriving in the region. The name Rat Portage had its origin in the Ojibwe name &quot;Wazhashk-Onigam&quot;, which, roughly translated, means portage to the country of the muskrats. A shortened and somewhat corrupted version, Rat Portage, was adopted by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in naming their post, then located on Old Fort Island on the Winnipeg River. When the post was moved to the mainland and a town grew up around it, the name Rat Portage was assumed by the community.

The town of Rat Portage was renamed in 1905 by using the first two letters of itself and the neighbouring towns of Keewatin and Norman to form the present-day City of Kenora. In 2001, the towns of Kenora (including Norman) and Keewatin as well as the Township of Jaffray Melick amalgamated under the &quot;Municipal Act&quot;.

Kenora is the administrative headquarters of the Anishinabe of Wauzhushk Onigum, Obashkaandagaang Bay, and Washagamis Bay First Nations band governments.

==Toponymy==

The name &quot;Kenora&quot; was coined by combining the first two letters of &quot;Ke&quot;ewatin, &quot;No&quot;rman and &quot;Ra&quot;t Portage.

The traditional Ojibwe name of Kenora is Wazhashk-Onigamiing, meaning &quot;place of the muskrat portage&quot;, corresponding to the older English name of the settlement, &quot;Rat Portage&quot;. The nearby First Nation band of the Anishinabe of Wauzhushk Onigum retains this name as well.

== History ==
Kenora is situated on the traditional territory of the Ojibway people. Among the earliest Europeans in the Lake of the Woods area was explorer and fur trader Pierre Gaultier de Varennes et de La Vérendrye. The first European, Jacques de Noyon, sighted Lake of the Woods in 1688.

Pierre de La Vérendrye established a secure French trading post, Fort Saint Charles, to the south of present-day Kenora near the current Canada/U.S. border in 1732, and France maintained the post until 1763 when it lost the territory to the British in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Until then, it was the most northwesterly settlement of New France. In 1836 the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a post on Old Fort Island, and in 1861, the Company opened a post on the mainland at Kenora&#x27;s current location.

In 1878, the company surveyed lots for the permanent settlement of &quot;Rat Portage&quot; (&quot;portage to the country of the muskrat&quot;) — the community kept that name until 1905, when it was renamed &quot;Kenora&quot;.
Kenora was once claimed as part of the Province of Manitoba, and there are early references to Rat Portage, Manitoba. There was a long-lasting argument between the two provinces known as the Ontario-Manitoba boundary dispute. Each province claimed the town as part of their territory and the dispute lasted from 1870 to 1884. Although Ottawa had ruled the town part of Manitoba in 1881, the issue was finally taken up with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which eventually decided in Ontario&#x27;s favour. Kenora officially became part of the province of Ontario in 1889. Boundaries were drawn up for the provinces and the Northwest Angle on Lake of the Woods which definitively drew the borders between Ontario, Manitoba, and the U.S. state of Minnesota.

Gold and the railway were both important in the community&#x27;s early history: gold was first discovered in the area in 1850, and by 1893, 20 mines were operating within of Rat Portage, and the first Canadian ocean-to-ocean train passed through in 1886 on the Canadian Pacific Railway. Among the entrepreneurs attracted to the town was the Hon. JEP Vereker, a retired British army officer and youngest son of the 4th Viscount Gort.

Later, a highway was built through Kenora in 1932, becoming part of Canada&#x27;s first coast-to-coast highway in 1943, and then part of the Trans-Canada Highway, placing the community on both of Canada&#x27;s major transcontinental transportation routes. The original barrier to the completion of the highway concerned the crossing of the Winnipeg River at two locations. The single-span arch bridges are among the longest of their type in North America.

During the Prohibition era in the United States, the Lake of the Woods served as a smuggler&#x27;s route for the transport of alcohol.

In December 1883, there was a large fire in Rat Portage, rendering 70 of the town&#x27;s then population of 700 homeless.

The Stanley Cup was won by the Kenora Thistles hockey team in 1907. The team featured such Hall of Famers as Billy McGimsie, Tommy Phillips, and Art Ross, for whom the Art Ross Trophy is named. Kenora is the smallest town to have won a major North American sports title.

Rat Portage is mentioned in Algernon Blackwood&#x27;s famous 1910 story, &quot;The Wendigo&quot;.

On November 22, 1965, around 400 Aboriginal protesters, inspired by the Selma to Montgomery marches against white supremacy and racial discrimination in the Southern United States, undertook a quarter-mile march against anti-indigenous racism along Main Street to Legion Hall, where they expressed their grievances to the city&#x27;s mayor and councillors. This march became widely referred to as Canada&#x27;s first civil rights march.
In 1967, the year of the Canadian Centennial, Kenora erected a sculpture known as Husky the Muskie. It has become the town&#x27;s mascot and one of its most recognizable features.

A dramatic bank robbery took place in Kenora on May 10, 1973. An unknown man entered the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce heavily armed and wearing a &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot;, a device utilising a clothespin, wires, battery and dynamite, where the user holds the clothespin in the mouth, exerting force on the clothespin. Should the user release the clothespin, two wires attached to both sides of the pin complete an electrical circuit, sending current from the battery, detonating the explosives. After robbing the bank, the robber exited the CIBC, and was preparing to enter a city vehicle driven by undercover police officer Don Milliard. A sniper, Robert Letain, positioned across the street, shot the robber, causing the explosives to detonate and kill the robber. Most of the windows on the shops on the main street were shattered as a result of the blast. Later, Kenora Police submitted DNA samples from the robber&#x27;s remains to a national database to identify him; however, the suspect was never positively identified.

The importance of the logging industry declined in the second part of the 20th century, and the last log boom was towed into Kenora in 1985. The tourist and recreation industries have become more important.

==Geography==

===Neighbourhoods===
In addition to the former towns of Keewatin and Jaffray Melick, the city includes the neighbourhoods of Norman, Rabbit Lake, Rideout, Pinecrest, Minto, and Lakeside.

Keewatin forms the westernmost section of the City of Kenora. Norman was a small community halfway between the village of Keewatin and Rat Portage. The Village of Keewatin was founded in 1877 while the Village of Norman was founded in 1892; both communities amalgamated with Rat Portage in 1905 to form the Township of Kenora. Keewatin eventually separated and was founded as a Township in 1908.

The Jaffray Melick neighbourhood is the north-easternmost section of the City of Kenora. The Township of Jaffray was founded in 1894 and the Township of Melick in 1902; the two townships were amalgamated in 1908 as Jaffray and Melick, and renamed Jaffray Melick in 1911. Compared to Keewatin, Norman, and Rat Portage, Jaffray Melick is the most rural community, with few retail stores and one golf course, Beauty Bay, on Black Sturgeon Lake.

===Climate===
Kenora has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;) with warm summers and cold, dry winters. Its climate is influenced by continental air masses. Winters are cold with a January high of and a low of . Temperatures below occur on 45 days. The average annual snowfall is , which is lower than places to the east as it is influenced by the dry air of continental high-pressure zones, resulting in relatively dry winters. Summers are warm with a July high of and a low of and temperatures above occur on 5.3 days. The average annual precipitation is , with most of it being concentrated in the summer months with June being the wettest month and February the driest.

During the winter Kenora will get precipitation mostly in the form of snow, other forms of winter precipitation include ice, sleet, and freezing rain. Snow cover usually lasts from November to March, about 154 days or 42% of the year. The city frequently gets late spring and summer thunderstorms, only on occasion severe, averaging 24 days a year with thunderstorm activity.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Kenora was on 11 July 1936. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 20 January 1943.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kenora had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median household income in 2005 for Kenora was $59,946, which is slightly below the Ontario provincial average of $60,455.

==Economy==

Forestry, tourism and mining are the three largest sectors of the Kenora economy. The population balloons in the spring and summer to almost double the normal population when summer residents move in. The Lake of the Woods and numerous smaller lakes situated all around Kenora are the major draw for cottagers who summer here. Many are from the neighbouring province of Manitoba and the state of Minnesota.

===Tourism===
Kenora, a site of natural attractions, has visitors from all over the world year round. In the summer months visitors come to the area to undertake activities including swimming, biking, fishing, hiking, and boating. Kenora&#x27;s tourist industry is also active during the winter months as visitors come not only to observe its natural environment but also to partake in ice fishing, snowboarding, skiing (both downhill and cross country) and snowmachining.

Kenora has two travel information centres. One is the newly renovated (2011) pavilion, located on the Harbourfront. The second information centre, called the Discovery Centre, opened July 22, 2011, and serves visitors year-round from its location at 931 Lake View Drive (just off of Highway 17 West, also known as the Trans Canada highway).

==Arts and culture==
The Lake of the Woods Museum and Douglas Family Art Centre are located at The MUSE.

Harbourfront, a park on the shore of Lake of the Woods, hosts the city&#x27;s annual winter and summer festivals, as well as concerts.

Huskie the Muskie, a statue of a fighting muskellunge, is located in McLeod Park.

The city&#x27;s downtown core has a public arts project, with 20 murals depicting the region&#x27;s history painted on buildings in the business district.

The city is home to a major international freshwater bass fishing tournament.

Kenora is sometimes stereotyped as an archetypal &quot;hoser&quot; community, evidenced by the phrase &quot;Kenora dinner jacket&quot; as a nickname for a hoser&#x27;s flannel shirt.

St. Alban&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral is in Kenora.

The now-defunct Kenora Thistles ice hockey won the Stanley Cup in 1907, making Kenora the smallest city to have ever won the trophy. Many local contemporary ice hockey clubs pay homage to the team by using its name, including the town&#x27;s amateur, junior, and senior-level men&#x27;s team.

==Government==

Kenora is represented in the House of Commons by Conservative MP Eric Melillo, and in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario by MPP Greg Rickford of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.

Dave Canfield served as mayor from 2000 until 2006, when he was defeated by Len Compton in the 2006 municipal election; Compton did not run in the 2010 municipal election, however, and Canfield was re-elected as his successor. The current mayor is Andrew Poirier.

Some residents of Kenora, citing dissatisfaction with the level of government service provided to the region by the provincial government, have proposed that the region secede from Ontario to join the province of Manitoba.

Via Rail offers passenger service to Redditt on the CN transcontinental rail line, approximately 30 minutes and north of Kenora. The CP transcontinental rail line passes directly through town.

Kenora Airport is located east northeast of the city centre.

M.S. Kenora is a cruise located at the waterfront.

Highway 17 passes through Kenora&#x27;s urban core, and the Highway 17A Kenora By-Pass goes around the city. Both routes are designated as part of the Trans-Canada Highway. Highway 658 extends northerly from Kenora to Redditt.

Kenora Transit operates three routes, from Monday to Saturday, 7:00am to 6:30pm.

===Health care===
Kenora&#x27;s hospital, Lake of the Woods District Hospital, has three facilities in the city: the hospital itself, Morningstar Rehabilitation Centre, and Mental Health and Addictions services, located in St. Joseph&#x27;s Health Centre.

=== Housing ===
Since Kenora is one of two judicial districts in Northwestern Ontario, it has disproportionate housing shortage as people from across the region with little to no social support in Kenora are unable to find places to stay after release from prison or while waiting in the city before their court dates. The situation worsened in 2013, when the judge in the Rainy River District moved and the position and its responsibilities was transferred to Kenora.

=== Military ===
The federal government maintains an armoury (Kenora Armoury at 800-11th Avenue North) in Kenora for the 116th Independent Field Battery, RCA.

==Education==
Two school boards and 2 community colleges function in the Kenora area.

The Keewatin-Patricia District School Board operates one high school (Beaver Brae Secondary School) and four elementary schools (Keewatin Public School, Evergreen School, King George IV School, and Valleyview School).

The Kenora Catholic District School Board operates one high school (Saint Thomas Aquinas High School) and three elementary schools (École Ste. Marguerite-Bourgeois, Pope John Paul II School and St. Louis School). The elementary school, officially named Pope John Paul II, amalgamated approximately 350 students from the former Mount Carmel and Our Lady of the Valley schools. École Ste. Marguerite-Bourgeois is a French immersion school.

Confederation College has a Kenora campus and serves post-secondary and adult education needs in the city and surrounding area. Seven Generations Post Secondary Institute also offer post secondary courses, focusing on Indigenous teachings. 

Housed within the college is Contact North, which offers Kenora residents local access to university and college programs not directly offered by the college campus. Contact North is Ontario&#x27;s most extensive distance education network providing access to education and training opportunities in remote locations of Northern Ontario through a network of access centres. Contact North works with 13 colleges and universities.

There is also an Indigenous college and education facility called Seven Generations, located in the building that once housed Lakewood Junior High School before becoming Seven Generations Education Institute. It prepares Indigenous and non-Indigenous students for work within the community and surrounding region.

==Geological significance==
One of Earth&#x27;s earliest supercontinents, a large landmass comprising several of today&#x27;s continents, predating Pangaea by 2.4 billion years, has been termed &quot;Kenorland&quot; by geologists, named after the Kenoran orogeny (also called the Algoman orogeny), which in turn was named after the town of Kenora, Ontario. In Kenora, rocks and geomagnetic evidence have been found which support Kenorland&#x27;s creation approximately 2.72 billion years ago (2.72 Ga) as a result of a series of accretion events and the formation of new continental crust, demarcating the earliest identifiably known land on Earth.

==Media==
The major news source in Kenora is the &quot;Kenora Miner and News&quot;.

===Television===
Kenora was Canada&#x27;s smallest (and North America&#x27;s second smallest) television market, served by only one television station, CJBN-TV channel 13, a Global affiliate that ceased broadcasting in January 2017. The Kenora region is not designated as a mandatory market for digital television conversion.

<doc id="179042" wikidata="Q2103" url="?curid=179042" title="Bochum">
<text>Bochum (, ; ; ; ) is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia. With a population of 372,348 (April 2023), it is the sixth-largest city (after Cologne, Düsseldorf, Dortmund, Essen and Duisburg) in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous German federal state, and the 16th-largest city in Germany. On the Ruhr Heights () hill chain, between the rivers Ruhr to the south and Emscher to the north (tributaries of the Rhine), it is the second largest city of Westphalia after Dortmund, and the fourth largest city of the Ruhr after Dortmund, Essen and Duisburg. It lies at the centre of the Ruhr, Germany&#x27;s largest urban area, in the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region, the second biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union, and belongs to the region of Arnsberg. Bochum is the sixth largest and one of the southernmost cities in the Low German dialect area. There are nine institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the Ruhr University Bochum (), one of the ten largest universities in Germany, and the Bochum University of Applied Sciences ().

==Geography==

===Geographical position===
The city lies on the low rolling hills of Bochum land ridge (Bochumer Landrücken), part of the Ruhrhöhen (highest elevations) between the Ruhr and Emscher rivers at the border of the southern and northern Ruhr coal region. The highest point of the city is at Kemnader Straße (Kemnader Street) in Stiepel at above sea level; the lowest point is at the Blumenkamp in Hordel.

The terrain of Bochum is characterised by rolling hills that rarely have more than three per cent graduation. Steeper graduation can be found at the Harpener Hellweg near the Berghofer Holz nature reserve (3.4%), at Westenfelder Straße in the borough of Wattenscheid (3.47%), or at Kemnader Straße, which begins at the banks of the Ruhr in Stiepel (), and rises to its highest point in the centre of Stiepel (, a 5.1% increase).

The city extends north to south and east to west. The perimeter of the city limits is .

It is surrounded by the cities of (in clockwise direction) Herne, Castrop-Rauxel, Dortmund, Witten, Hattingen, Essen and Gelsenkirchen.

===Geology===
There is sedimentary rock of carbon and chalk. The geological strata can be visited in the former quarry of Klosterbusch in Querenburg and at the Geological Gardens in Wiemelhausen.

===Waterways===
The urban area is divided into the river Ruhr catchment in the south and the Emscher catchment in the north. The Ruhr&#x27;s tributaries are the Oelbach (where as well a waste water treatment plant is established), Gerther Mühlenbach, Harpener Bach, Langendreer Bach, Lottenbach, Hörsterholzer Bach and the Knöselbach. The Ruhr in combination with upstream reservoirs is also used for drinking water abstraction. The Emscher&#x27;s tributaries are Hüller Bach with Dorneburger Mühlenbach, Hofsteder Bach, Marbach, Ahbach, Kabeisemannsbach and Goldhammer Bach. The industrial developments in the region since the 19th century were leading to a kind of division of labour between the two river catchments, pumping drinking water from the Ruhr into the municipal supply system and discharging waste water mainly into the Emscher system. Today approximately 10% of the waste water in the Emscher catchment is discharged via the Hüller Bach. and treated in the centralized waste water treatment plant of the Emschergenossenschaft in Bottrop. The ecological restoration of the Emscher tributaries initiated by the Emschergenossenschaft started with the Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park in 1989.

===Vegetation===
The south of the city has woods, the best known of which are the . These are generally mixed forests of oak and beech. The occurrence of holly gives evidence of Bochum&#x27;s temperate climate. 844 species of plants can be found within the city limts

===Climate===
Bochum features an Oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;) characterized by cool winters and short warm summers. Extreme temperatures are uncommon. However, temperatures rising above 30 °C (86 °F) are to be expected on multiple days in summer and the climate station closest to the City did record a peak temperature of 40 °C (104 °F) on July 25, 2019.

On the other extreme, freezing temperatures are common between mid-November and late March. In some years, however, frosts may occur as late as early May. Temperatures below −10 °C are, especially in recent years, only seen on rare occasions. The city lies within the warmer extent of the 8a USDA plant hardiness zone (−12.2 to −9.4 °C or 10 to 15 °F). Some winters may pass without a frost below −5 °C (data from the nearest active climate station). These comparably mild conditions in Winter permit the planting of plants that would either not be reliably hardy or not able to bloom throughout Germany like &quot;Trachycarpus&quot; palms, Summer lilac, &quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; and Rosemary.

However, winters can be unpredictable with strong fluctuations in temperatures: In mid-February 2021, the city was affected by a severe cold spell bringing temperatures down to –15 degrees Celsius (5 °F) accompanied by heavy snowfall which hindered traffic for multiple days. A week later, a temperature of 17 °C (63 °F) was recorded, an increase of 32K.

The total precipitation of 815mm is distributed relatively evenly through most of the year but has a peak in winter and two minima in late spring and July, respectively. June shows a second peak in precipitation due to the return of the westerlies which leads to more thunderstorms being generated along frontal boundaries of Atlantic low-pressure systems. In recent years, the city was affected by summer and spring droughts. Thunderstorms are not uncommon in the warm season and can generate intense downpours and sporadically hail.

The city experiences little sunshine in winter with a minimum of 1,3h per day in December and a lot more in early summer and late spring with May featuring 7,5h per day. The total amount of sunshine per year is 1689h.

Due to the cities northern latitude of 51°N, seasonal day-length variation is significant. The longest day of the year, June 21, features 16 h 38 min. of daylight while the shortest day of the year which is December 21 is only 7 h and 50 min. long.

===Districts===
Bochum is divided into six administrative sections (), alongside their respective sub-districts (), with a total of 362,213 inhabitants living in an urban area of .

==History==

Bochum dates from the 9th century, when Charlemagne set up a royal court at the junction of two important trade routes. It was first officially mentioned in 1041 as &quot;Cofbuokheim&quot; in a document of the archbishops of Cologne. In 1321, Count Engelbert II von der Marck granted Bochum a town charter, but the town remained insignificant until the 19th century, when the coal mining and steel industries emerged in the Ruhr area, leading to the growth of the entire region. In the early 19th century it was part of the Grand Duchy of Berg, a client state of France, then it passed to Prussia following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, and in 1871 it became part of the German Empire. The population of Bochum increased from about 4,500 in 1850 to 100,000 in 1904. Bochum acquired city status, incorporating neighbouring towns and villages. Additional population gains came from immigration, primarily from Poland. Bochum was the main center of the Polish community of the Ruhr, being the seat of various Polish organizations and enterprises. The Poles were subjected to anti-Polish policies aimed at Germanisation, and the Central Office for Monitoring the Polish Movement in the Rhine-Westphalian Industrial District () was established by the German authorities in Bochum in 1909.

===The Nazi era and World War II===
On 28 October 1938, 250 Polish or stateless Jews were expelled from Bochum to Poland. On 9 November 1938, Kristallnacht, the Bochum synagogue was set on fire and there was rioting against Jewish citizens. The first Jews from Bochum were deported to Nazi concentration camps and many Jewish institutions and homes were destroyed. Some 500 Jewish citizens are known by name to have been killed in the Holocaust, including 19 who were younger than 16 years old. Joseph Klirsfeld was Bochum&#x27;s rabbi at this time. He and his wife fled to Palestine. In December 1938, the Jewish elementary school teacher Else Hirsch began organising groups of children and adolescents to be sent to the Netherlands and England, sending ten groups in all. Many Jewish children and those from other persecuted groups were taken in by Dutch families and thereby saved from abduction or deportation and death.

On 15 July 1939, the Gestapo entered the headquarters of the Union of Poles in Germany in Bochum, searched it and interrogated its chief Michał Wesołowski, however, it did not obtain the desired lists of Polish activists, which had been previously hidden by Poles. Increased Nazi terror and persecutions of Poles followed, and in response, many Poles from the region came to Bochum for organizational and information meetings. During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, the Nazis carried out mass arrests of local Polish activists, who were then sent to concentration camps. Local Polish premises and seats of organizations were looted and expropriated by Nazi Germany.

During the war, Germany operated a prison in the city with three forced labour subcamps within present-day city limits, an additional detention center, a camp for Romani people in the present-day Wattenscheid district, and three subcamps of the Buchenwald concentration camp. A report from July 1943 listed 100 forced labour camps in Bochum.

Because the Ruhr region was an area of high residential density and a centre for the manufacture of weapons, it was a major target in the war. Women with young children, school children and the homeless fled or were evacuated to safer areas, leaving cities largely deserted to the arms industry, coal mines and steel plants and those unable to leave.

During the Holocaust, in 1942–1943, local Jews were deported to German-occupied Czechoslovakia, Latvia and Poland.

Bochum was first bombed heavily in May and June 1943. On 13 May 1943, the city hall was hit, destroying the top floor, and leaving the next two floors in flames. On 4 November 1944, in an attack involving 700 British bombers, the steel plant, Bochumer Verein, was hit. One of the largest steel plants in Germany, more than 10,000 high-explosive and 130,000 incendiary bombs were stored there, setting off a conflagration that destroyed the surrounding neighbourhoods. An aerial photo shows the devastation.

The town centre of Bochum was a strategic target during the Oil Campaign. In 150 air raids on Bochum, over 1,300 bombs were dropped on Bochum and Gelsenkirchen. By the end of the war, 38% of Bochum had been destroyed. 70,000 citizens were homeless and at least 4,095 dead. Of Bochum&#x27;s more than 90,000 homes, only 25,000 remained for the 170,000 citizens who survived the war, many by fleeing to other areas. Most of the remaining buildings were damaged, many with only one usable room. Only 1,000 houses in Bochum remained undamaged after the war. Only two of 122 schools remained unscathed; others were totally destroyed. Hunger was rampant. A resident of neighbouring Essen was quoted on 23 April 1945 as saying, &quot;Today, I used up my last potato... it will be a difficult time till the new [autumn] potatoes are ready to be picked – if they&#x27;re not stolen.&quot;

The US army ground advance into Germany reached Bochum in April 1945. Encountering desultory resistance, the US 79th Infantry Division captured the city on 10 April 1945.

After the war, Bochum was occupied by the British, who established two camps to house people displaced by the war. The majority of them were former Polish &quot;Zwangsarbeiter&quot;, forced labourers, many of them from the Bochumer Verein.

Allied bombing destroyed 83% of the built up area of Bochum during World War II. Today around a third of Bochum consists of buildings from before World War II. More than sixty years after the war, bombs continue to be found in the region, usually by construction workers. One found in October 2008 in Bochum town centre led to the evacuation of 400 and involved hundreds of emergency workers. A month earlier, a buried bomb exploded in neighbouring Hattingen, injuring 17 people.

===Post-war period===
After the war, Bochum was part of West Germany and the newly established state of North Rhine-Westphalia, consisting of the Rhineland and Westphalia.

In the postwar period, Bochum began developing as a cultural centre of the Ruhr area. In 1965, the Ruhr University was opened, the first modern university in the Ruhr area and the first to be founded in Germany since World War II. Since the seventies, Bochum&#x27;s industry has moved from heavy industry to the service sector. Between 1960 and 1980, the coal mines all closed. Other industries, such as automotive, compensated for the loss of jobs. The Opel Astra was assembled at the Opel Bochum plant; however, by 2009, the factory was in serious financial difficulties and in December 2012, Opel announced that it would stop vehicle production at the Bochum plant in 2016.

In the course of a comprehensive community reform in 1975, Wattenscheid, a formerly independent city, was integrated into the city of Bochum. A local referendum against the integration failed. In 2007, the new synagogue of the Jewish community of Bochum, Herne und Hattingen was opened. In 2008, Nokia closed down its production plant, causing the loss of thousands of jobs, both at the plant and at local suppliers. 20,000 people showed up to protest against the closing. Within months, the Canadian high-tech company, Research in Motion, announced plans to open a research facility, its first outside Canada, adding several hundred jobs.

==Places of interest==
===Architecture===
* Bochum City Hall was built from 1927 to 1931 and was designed by architect Karl Roth as a modern office building, but in the Renaissance style, reflecting the industrial era&#x27;s middle class, inventions and discoveries. There were statues of bronze and stone, and in the city council chambers, a bell tower. The ornate décor gave the Nazis an excuse to hound the then-mayor, who was of Jewish descent, driving him to suicide in 1933. Most of the bronze statues were melted down for the war effort and the stone carvings were damaged by the war, save for some small lion&#x27;s heads over the entrance. Also left undamaged are two themed courtyard fountains made by August Vogel, the &quot;Fountain of Beauty&quot; and the &quot;Fountain of Happiness&quot;, as well as Augusto Vasaris&#x27; florentine main entrance, which displays the motto, &quot;In Labore Honos&quot; (In labour lies honour). In 1951, a set of 28 chimes was installed, manufactured in Bochum. Known for their clarity of tone, they are the first cast steel chimes in the world. In front of the city hall is a large bell that was made by the Bochum &quot;Verein für Bergbau und Gusstahlfabrikation AG&quot; (Association for Mining and Cast Steel Manufacturing). Displayed at the 1867 Paris World&#x27;s Fair, it has a diameter of and weighs . It was damaged during World War II and can no longer be rung.
* Altes Brauhaus Rietkötter, the Old Rietkötter Brewing House is one of the oldest houses in Bochum, dating from 1630. Originally a private home, it became a brewery in 1777. After nearly being torn down after the war, it now has preservation status and today houses a restaurant, where they still brew their own beer.
* The Kaufhaus Kortum department store dates from 1913 and was built as one of the nearly 20 regional stores owned by Alsberg Bros. (Gebr. Alsberg, AG) of Cologne. During the Nazi era, these stores were taken away from their Jewish owners and put into non-Jewish hands. Today, the &quot;Kaufhaus Kortum&quot; building has preservation status and houses an electronics store.
* The Friedrich Lueg Haus was built in 1924–1925 as the first high-rise building in Bochum. Contracted by the Lueg Company, the seven-story building was designed by the architect Emil Pohle. It suffered a fire during a bombing raid in 1944 and was renovated after the war. Today, the upper floors are small offices and internet companies. The seven-theatre Bochum Union Cinema rents the ground floor, showing a variety of domestic and international films.
* Mutter Wittig is a baroque-style building in the town centre, originally opened as a bakery and inn in 1870. Damaged in World War II, its façade is protected by preservation status. It houses a restaurant and its windows are decorated with displays of old Bochum.
* Sparkasse Bochum (Bochum Savings Bank) is a town landmark designed by the architect Wilhelm Kreis. It opened in 1928 and was emblematic of the modern era. It was heavily damaged during the war, but was afterwards restored to its former appearance.
* The Schlegel Tower is the only remaining structure of the once-important Schlegel brewery, which closed in 1980.
* The Jahrhunderthalle (Hall of the Century) is the former gas and power station of a steel mill built at the turn of the 20th century. With the closing of the mill, the plant was renovated and turned into a three-hall concert and event site with an industrial ambiance.
* Dahlhauser Heide is an example of social welfare provided by wealthy German industrialists for their workers. Built in the early 1900s by the Krupp family for their coal mine workers, the modest and tastefully designed two-family houses were to enable self-sufficiency by providing gardens and a stall for a pig or a goat, &quot;the miner&#x27;s cow&quot;. The estate, which has the appearance of a small, rural town, gained preservation status in the 1970s.
* Blankenstein Castle was built in the 13th century by Count Adolf I of the Mark. Though located in Hattingen, it is owned by Bochum and has a significant history. On 8 June 1321, Count Engelbert II of the Mark granted Bochum its town charter there. Today, only the gate and one tower remain.
* Haus Kemnade is a moated castle. Though located in the town of Hattingen, the castle is property of the city of Bochum in 1921. Documents regarding its earliest dates of construction have been lost; it is first mentioned in 1393. Parts of the castle were built during the Renaissance and baroque periods. The castle&#x27;s location on the banks of the Ruhr river was changed when the flood of 1486 receded on the opposite side, cutting the castle off from the neighbouring village. The castle remained in private hands till 1921, when it was deeded to the city of Bochum. In 1961, a museum of local history was installed, including a large collection of 16th to 20th century musical instruments. A collection of East Asian objects is also now located there, as well as a satellite of the Bochum Museum and an art exhibition space. There is also a restaurant on site. Behind the castle is a timber-framed farmhouse from 1800, now a museum exhibiting farm life from the past.
* The Exzenterhaus is a commercial office building which is the tallest building in Bochum at 90.5 metres. It was constructed on top of World War II era bunker, with the more modern section of the building rising 15 storeys above the top of the bunker. The top 15 floors are split into three, five storey sections, each which cantilever up to 4.5 metres, giving the impression of twisting structure.

====Religious architecture====

* Propsteikirche St. Peter und Paul is the oldest church in Bochum, built between 785 and 800 by Charlemagne. It was rebuilt in the 11th century, but was severely damaged by fire in 1517. In 1547, it was again rebuilt, this time in the late Gothic style. The 68-metre (223 ft) high bell tower is one of the landmarks of Bochum. The interior includes a baptismal font from 1175, the reliquary shrine of St. Perpetua and her slave Felicitas, and a high altar with a crucifix from 1352.
* Pauluskirche is the main Protestant church of the city. After the Reformation, both Catholics and Lutherans shared the Propsteikirche, often contentiously. In 1655, the Lutherans began to build their own church with the help of donations from the Dutch Republic, Sweden, Courland and Denmark. The church was heavily damaged in a bombing raid on 12 June 1943 and was later rebuilt after the war. Next to the church is a monument to peace. A statue of an old woman searching for a loved one, it is also a memorial to the 4 November 1944 bombing raid on Bochum. Hans Ehrenberg served as minister here, until he was arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen by the Nazis.
* The Christuskirche, built in the neo-Gothic style, opened in 1879 and was among the most beautiful churches in Europe. In 1931, the room in the steeple was extended to a cenotaph for those killed in World War I. During an air raid in 1943, the church was destroyed, except for the steeple. After the war, the ruins were integrated into a new, modern structure and the steeple became a memorial dedicated to peace and understanding among nations.
* The neo-Gothic Marienkirche, built between 1868 and 1872, was heavily damaged in World War II (see photo above), but was rebuilt after the war. It is now closed and scheduled for demolition. The stained glass windows have been removed and it has fallen victim to vandalism.
* Stiepeler Dorfkirche is over 1000 years old and was commemorated by a stamp in 2008. A small church consisting of one room was built by Countess Imma von Stiepel. Between 1130 and 1170, the old church was replaced by a Romanesque basilica. Today, the steeple and transept remain. Between 1150 and 1200, the interior walls and ceiling were decorated with a number of Romanesque paintings.
* The new synagogue, which opened in 2007, consists of a white cube and stands in contrast to the round shape of the planetarium next door. The façade shows overall a variation on the Solomon&#x27;s Seal achieved by relocated brickstones. The interior is graced with a gold-coloured canopy.

===Parks and gardens===

Bochum has a municipal zoo, a large municipal park and a number of other gardens and parks. The Ruhr University Botanical Gardens has thousands of plants from all over the world. Among others there is a tropical garden, a cactus garden, and a Chinese garden designed in the southern Chinese style, the only one of its kind in Germany.

The Geological Garden was the first of its kind in Germany. The nearly park is the site of an old coal mine, the Zeche Friederika, which operated from 1750 to 1907. In 1962, the property came under environmental protection and a decade later was turned into a geological garden.

Other scenic areas include the West Park, Lake Kemnade, Lake Ümmingen and the municipal forest, Weitmarer Holz.

==Society and culture==

===Leisure and entertainment===

The herdsmans of the town guided until 1870 the cattle of the citizens to the &quot;Vöde&quot;, a grassland outside the town limits, a part of it is today the municipal park. Local legends say it is &quot;the last herdsman Fritz Kortebusch&quot;. But he died 1866, nevertheless he done this job for a long time. 
* Engelbert statue in the front of the Propsteikirche. In former times it was a fountain with statue at the Kortumstrasse.

* Cenotaph for the victims of the mine disaster at &quot;Vereinigte Präsident&quot; in 1936 at the graveyard in Bochum-Hamme. The sculpture was created by Wilhelm Wulff. Strict guidelines for artwork were in effect during the Nazi dictatorship, yet the sculpture follows only a few of them. The inscription also avoids typical Nazi phraseology.

=== Music ===
Founded in 1919, Bochum&#x27;s orchestra, the Bochumer Symphoniker, has developed over the course of its history into one of the most important concert orchestras in western Germany. Since October 28, 2016, the Anneliese Brost Musikforum Ruhr has been a permanent venue. Tung-Chieh Chuang has been General Music Director of the Bochum Symphony Orchestra and Artistic Director of the Anneliese Brost Musikforum Ruhr since the 2021/2022 season. The Bochum Philharmonic Choir gives about four to five concerts a year and usually performs together with the Bochum Symphony Orchestra. In one of the venues, the Audimax of the Ruhr University Bochum, there is also one of the most modern organs from the Klais Orgelbau with 82 registers.

The free rock festival Bochum Total has been taking place in Bochum city center since 1986. With 900,000 spectators, it is now one of the largest music events in Europe.

Since the summer of 1995, the Kunstwerkstatt &lt;Art Workshop&gt; am Hellweg, a former carpenter&#x27;s workshop, has hosted a wide variety of concerts all year round, from medieval music to baroque music, from Bach to jazz and boogie-woogie. In this informal setting, music fans have the opportunity not only to “sit in the front row”, but also to come into direct contact with the artists. Often artists also play here who can be heard in the Carnegie Hall, in the Concertgebouw, in the Berlin Philharmonic or in the Great Hall of the Tchaikovsky Conservatory. Again and again. The initiators, Dr. Reinhard Cebulla and his wife Anna, received the Badge of Honor from the city of Bochum in 2013 and the Wattenscheid St. Gertrudis Prize in 2014.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Bochum is connected to the Autobahn network by the A 40, A 43 and A 44 autobahns. In addition, Bochum has a ring road, built to expressway standards, consisting of four segments; the Donezk, Oviedo, Nordhausen and Sheffield-Ring roads. It serves as a three-quarter loop around central Bochum and begins and ends at Autobahn A40. Ruhr University Bochum is also served by an expressway running from the Nordhausen-Ring to Autobahn A43. Until 2012, a new interchange (Dreieck Bochum-West) between the Donezk-Ring and Autobahn A40 is being constructed within tight parameters due to the existence of a nearby factory.

Apart from the autobahns and expressways, there is also a small ring road around the centre of Bochum, where most roads radiating out of Bochum begin. Most main roads in Bochum are multi-lane roads with traffic lights. Bochum is also served by the Bundesstraße 51 and Bundesstraße 226. B51 runs to Herne and Hattingen, and B226 runs to Gelsenkirchen and Witten.

===Railways===

Bochum has a central station situated on the line from Duisburg to Dortmund, connecting the city to the long-distance network of Deutsche Bahn as well as to the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn network.

===Bus, tram, underground===
Local service is supplied mainly by BOGESTRA, a joint venture handling transportation between the cities of Bochum and Gelsenkirchen. The Bochum Stadtbahn is a single underground line connecting the University of Bochum to Herne, and the Bochum/Gelsenkirchen tramway network is made up of several lines, partially underground, connecting to Gelsenkirchen, Hattingen and Witten. Public transport in the city is priced according to the fare system of the VRR transport association.

===Waterways===
As one of the few Ruhr area cities, Bochum is not directly connected with the German waterway net; the closest link is in the more northern located Herne at the Rhine-Herne Canal. In the south the border of Bochum is marked by the Ruhr. Up to the first half of the 19th century it was one of the most-travelled rivers in Europe and was mainly used for coal departure. Aside from cruise ships, it is no longer used for commercial navigation.

===Air===
The closest airports are Essen/Mülheim Airport (27 km), Dortmund Airport (31 km) and Düsseldorf Airport (47 km). To reach the airport in Düsseldorf, there are ICE, InterCity, RE and S railway lines.

<text>The Jerk is a 1979 American comedy film directed by Carl Reiner and written by Steve Martin, Carl Gottlieb, and Michael Elias (from a story by Martin and Gottlieb). This was Martin&#x27;s first starring role in a feature film. The film also features Bernadette Peters, M. Emmet Walsh, Catlin Adams, Maurice Evans, and Jackie Mason. Critical reviews were mostly positive, and &quot;The Jerk&quot; was a major financial success.

==Plot==
Navin Johnson, a homeless person sleeping in a stairwell in Los Angeles, addresses the camera directly to tell his life story.

The white adopted son of black sharecroppers in Mississippi, Navin grows to adulthood naïvely unaware of these circumstances. He is unable to dance in rhythm to the spirited folk songs played by the family, but finds that he can do so perfectly to a champagne-style song on the radio. Seeing this moment as a calling, he excitedly decides to leave home and travel to St. Louis, where the broadcast originated. Along the way, he adopts a dog and names it &quot;Shithead&quot; after angering the guests at a motel by waking them up in the middle of the night, having misinterpreted the dog&#x27;s barking at his door as a warning of a fire.

Navin finds a job as a gas station attendant, where he attempts to detain some thieves but accidentally destroys a nearby church. Later, a madman chooses his name at random from the telephone book and decides to kill him. As the gunman waits for an opportunity, Navin solders a brace to a customer&#x27;s eyeglasses to stop them from slipping down his nose. The customer, Stan Fox, is an inventor who promises to try to market the device and split any profits with Navin. The gunman opens fire at Navin but misses, and Navin flees to the grounds of a traveling carnival.

Navin is hired as a weight guesser and is brusquely seduced by Patty Bernstein, an intimidating daredevil motorcyclist. Later, while operating a miniature railway, he meets a cosmetologist named Marie Kimble and arranges a date with her. When a jealous Patty interrupts and starts to beat Navin, Marie easily knocks her unconscious. The two begin a relationship, and Navin decides to ask Marie to marry him. Before he can do so, though, she leaves him because he cannot provide financial security. Devastated, Navin takes Shithead and travels to Los Angeles. There, the gunman who tried to kill him—now sane and working as a private investigator—tracks him down and gives him a letter from Stan requesting a meeting.

Stan has been able to market Navin&#x27;s device, now branded as the Opti-Grab, and gives him a check for $250,000 as the first installment on his share of the profits. Navin finds and marries Marie, and the two adopt a life of extravagant spending as his wealth continues to grow. However, Navin is soon named as defendant in a class action lawsuit brought by millions of Opti-Grab customers who have become permanently cross-eyed after using the device. Navin loses the suit and is ordered to pay $10 million in damages, leaving him broke, and he storms out into the street after an argument with Marie.

Having finished his story, Navin resigns himself to living in poverty, only to be found by his adoptive family, who have brought Marie and Shithead with them. The family has become wealthy by investing the money Navin sent them from time to time, and they take him and Marie home to live in their new house, which is nearly identical to their old shack but larger and sturdier. Once again Navin dances on the porch to folk songs, this time with perfect rhythm.

==Cast==
Director Carl Reiner, credited as &quot;Carl Reiner, the Celebrity&quot;, plays himself. Former Playboy Playmate Sharon Johansen plays Mrs. Hartounian, while Alfred Dennis has a small role as Irving. In addition there are uncredited appearances by Reiner&#x27;s son Rob Reiner as the truck driver who picks up Navin, Harrison Ford who interacts with Martin briefly as a circus construction worker, and character actor Larry Hankin briefly appears as a circus hand.

==Production==
By 1977, comedian Steve Martin was experiencing wild success. He wanted to cross over to a film career, believing it promised more longevity. Basing his film proposal on a line from his act — &quot;It wasn&#x27;t always easy for me; I was born a poor black child&quot; — he fleshed out his ideas into a series of notes he intended to deliver to studios. With confidence in his budding standup career, he imagined it would not be difficult to break into Hollywood. Instead, he found it more difficult than expected. Bill McEuen was acquainted with Paramount Pictures president David Picker, and convinced Picker to sign Martin for a three-year contract at the studio after showing him one of his routines at the Boarding House comedy club in San Francisco.

Martin passed along his notes, which the studio read carefully. It described a series of odd jobs lead character &quot;Steve&quot; would hold in his saga. Martin developed this concept into the first draft of &quot;The Jerk&quot;, but Paramount passed on the project after Picker left the studio. However, Picker convinced his new employer Universal Studios to sign a distribution deal for the film, which would leave Martin in creative control of the project. Martin was able to pick which director he wanted to work with. Martin initially chose Mike Nichols, but Nichols then &quot;bowed out&quot; of the project in 1978. Martin&#x27;s next choice was Carl Reiner, famous for his work on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

The duo met constantly, and the film&#x27;s title grew out of their conversations. Martin recounts in his memoir:It needs to be something short, yet have the feeling of an epic tale. Like Dostoyevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;, but not that. Like &quot;The Jerk&quot;.

Martin wrote the part of &quot;Marie&quot; with Bernadette Peters in mind. He adapted several bits of his standup act to fit within the film, such as a monologue in which he emotionally exits a scene, remarking &quot;I don&#x27;t need anything&quot;, but nevertheless picking up each object he passes on his way out. In co-writing the script with Carl Gottlieb and Michael Elias, their goal was to provide a laugh on each page of the screenplay.

Principal photography took 45 days using 85 locations in Greater Los Angeles, on a $4.6 million budget. This included Mohammed al Fassi&#x27;s mansion in Beverly Hills, Pasadena, Westlake Village and Devonshire Downs in Northridge. In shooting the film, Reiner &quot;ran a joyful set&quot;, according to Martin, with the cast and crew eating lunch together each day. Martin&#x27;s favorite moment of the film, as he detailed in his 2007 memoir &quot;Born Standing Up&quot;, was the scene in which he and Peters sing &quot;Tonight You Belong to Me&quot;. Martin felt the moment was touching, and waited in anticipation at the film&#x27;s premiere screening in St. Louis. Unfortunately, much of the audience left during the scene to buy more popcorn.

===Deleted scenes===
A scene in which Bill Murray was to have made a cameo was cut from the final film.

An alternate, comic introduction of Marie (Peters), near the train ride Navin was running at the carnival, was shot. When her nephew takes off on the train, Navin rescues him, and in returning the boy to Marie, has the bill of his engineer&#x27;s cap pulled down over his eyes so he cannot see the toy village he (Navin) destroys like a lunatic. This scene might have been edited due to a reference to Godzilla.

Another scene that was cut featured Gailard Sartain as a Texas oil millionaire who tearfully begs Navin for money to replace the cracked, dried-out leather seats on his private jet. Navin grants his request and he gratefully states: &quot;Now I can fly my friends to the Super Bowl like a MAN, and not some damned BUM!&quot;

The television version features a scene in which a forlorn Navin, trying to forget Marie, spends six hours on the Round Up carnival ride. The boss orders the ride stopped, and Navin is removed by two carnival workers, who sit him down on the ride&#x27;s stairs. &quot;What are you looking at?&quot;, he asks them. &quot;Haven&#x27;t you seen a man so broken he needed to spin?&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a hit, earning over $73 million domestically, (making the movie the eighth highest-grossing of 1979) and $100 million worldwide, having been produced on a relatively low budget of $4 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 82% based on 44 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Crude, crass, and oh so quotable, &quot;The Jerk&quot; is nothing short of an all-out comedic showcase for Steve Martin.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 61 based on 14 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The Jerk&quot; &quot;is by turns funny, vulgar and backhandedly clever, never more so than when it aspires to absolute stupidity. And Mr. Martin, who began his career with an arrow stuck through his head, has since developed a real genius for playing dumb ... Even when it&#x27;s crude—which is quite a lot of the time—it&#x27;s not mean-spirited ... Mr. Martin and his co-star, Bernadette Peters, work very sweetly together, even when they sing a duet of &#x27;Tonight You Belong to Me,&#x27; carrying sweetness to what could easily have become an intolerable extreme.&quot;

BBC film review rated the movie two out of five stars and described the film as an &quot;early watered-down version of the crude comedy the Farrelly Brothers would later take to new extremes&quot; and made references to it having similar themes to the early 1980s parody film &quot;Airplane!&quot; Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; also gave the film a mixed review, stating &quot;The Jerk&quot; was &quot;all gags and very little comedy&quot; and built of &quot;gag situations [which] are milked for one-time laughs. They don&#x27;t grow out of his character, or contribute to it.&quot;

VideoHound&#x27;s Golden Movie Retriever reviewed the film for its book and rated the movie as being two and a half stars. The author of the review referred to Steve Martin&#x27;s silly, exaggerated acting as complementary to the early comedian Jerry Lewis.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Jerk&quot; has been praised as not only one of Martin&#x27;s best comedic efforts, but also one of the funniest films ever made. In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; voted &quot;The Jerk&quot; the 48th greatest comedy film of all time. This film is No. 20 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot; and No. 89 on the American Film Institute list AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the film as the tenth top comedy film of all time. 
&quot;Premiere&quot; voted Steve Martin&#x27;s performance of Navin Johnson No. 99 on their list, &quot;The 100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;. A BBC poll of more than 250 critics rated the film as the 99th greatest comedy of all time.

Christiane Kubrick hailed it as one of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s favorite films of all time. It led to Kubrick meeting with Martin to discuss working together on his film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Steve Martin was asked if the film would be accepted in this day and age with all of the &quot;heightened racial sensitivity.&quot; His response was that he had not watched the movie himself in a very long time, but when he reflects on his experience with making the movie he recalls everyone being treated &quot;with such respect&quot; throughout the filming process.

==Sequel==
&quot;The Jerk&quot; had a television film sequel, &quot;The Jerk, Too&quot; (1984), starring Mark Blankfield as Navin and co-starring Stacey Nelkin. Steve Martin was executive producer, but did not write the screenplay.

<text>The Land Camera is a model of self-developing film camera manufactured by Polaroid between 1948 and 1983. It is named after the inventor, American scientist Edwin Land, who developed a process for self-developing photography between 1943 and 1947. After Edwin Land&#x27;s retirement from Polaroid in 1982, the name &#x27;Land&#x27; was dropped from the camera name. The first commercially available model was the Model 95, which produced sepia-colored prints in about 1 minute. It was first sold to the public on November 26, 1948.

==Film==

The photography developing process, invented by Polaroid founder Edwin Land, employs diffusion transfer to move the dyes from the negative to the positive via a reagent. A negative sheet was exposed inside the camera, then lined up with a positive sheet and squeezed through a set of rollers which spread a reagent between the two layers, creating a developing film &quot;sandwich&quot;. The negative developed quickly, after which some of the unexposed silver halide grains (and the latent image it contained) were solubilized by the reagent and transferred by diffusion from the negative to the positive. After a minute, the back of the camera was opened and the negative peeled away to reveal the print.

In 1963, Land introduced &quot;Polacolor&quot; pack film, which made instant color photographs possible. This process involved pulling two tabs from the camera, the second which pulled the film sandwich through the rollers to develop out of the camera. The instant color process is much more complex, involving a negative which contains three layers of emulsion sensitive to blue, green, and red. Underneath each layer are dye developing molecules in their complementary colors of yellow, magenta, and cyan. When light strikes an emulsion layer, it blocks the complementary dye below it. For instance, when blue strikes the blue sensitive emulsion layer, it blocks the yellow dye, but allows the magenta and cyan dyes to transfer to the positive, which combine to create blue. When green and red (yellow) strikes their respective layers, it blocks the complementary dyes of magenta and cyan below them, allowing only yellow dye to transfer to the positive.

In 1972, integral film was introduced which did not require the user to time the development or peel apart the negative from the positive. This process was similar to Polacolor film with added timing and receiving layers. The film itself integrates all the layers to expose, develop, and fix the photo into a plastic envelope commonly associated with a Polaroid photo. The Polaroid SX-70 was the first camera to use this film.

Improvements in SX-70 film led to the higher speed 600 series film, then to different formats such as 500 series (captiva), and spectra.

==Cameras==
===Roll film===
The original cameras folded into the body and used bellows to protect the light path. The film was put on two spools, one with the negative roll, and one with the positive paper and reagent pods. The film developed inside the camera. The exception to this is the Polaroid Swinger, a hard-bodied roll-film camera whose film was pulled out of the camera body to develop outside the camera. The film for roll-film cameras was discontinued in 1992.

===100 Series Pack cameras===
These cameras were developed after the rollfilm models and were designed to use the newly developed 100 series pack film. As with the Swinger the film sandwich was pulled out of the camera to develop outside of the camera, but instead of two separate rolls the film was built into a compact easy loading film pack which contained 8 exposures. Hard body plastic models were marketed later a low cost alternative to the more expensive models with bellows.

There are four generations of folding colorpack cameras: the 100, the 200, the 300, and 400 series. Polaroid announced in 2008 the discontinuation of all of its film by 2009, and Fujifilm stopped producing pack film in 2016. Polaroid B.V. manufactures and sells Polaroid integrative type film for 600 and SX-70 cameras. In September 2019, Spectra/Image film was discontinued.

Meanwhile, Bob Crowley, New55, the investor David Bohnett and Florian Kaps, known as the founder of Impossible Project (now Polaroid B.V.), managed to produce packfilm for the folding colourpack cameras under the label New55. New55 FILM ended operations on December 31, 2017.

Supersence (also founded by Florian Kaps) currently produces single-shot packs handmade from original 8x10 film manufactured by Polaroid named ONE INSTANT.

<doc id="179058" wikidata="Q312110" url="?curid=179058" title="Sancho IV of Castile">
<text>Sancho IV of Castile (12 May 1258 – 25 April 1295) called the Brave (&quot;el Bravo&quot;), was the king of Castile, León and Galicia (now parts of Spain) from 1284 to his death. Following his brother Ferdinand&#x27;s death, he gained the support of nobles who declared him king instead of Ferdinand&#x27;s son Alfonso. Faced with revolts throughout his reign, before he died he made his wife regent for his son, who became Ferdinand IV.

==Biography==
Sancho was the second son of Alfonso X and Yolanda, daughter of James I of Aragon. His elder brother, Ferdinand de la Cerda, died in November 1275. In 1282 Sancho assembled a coalition of nobles to declare for him against Ferdinand&#x27;s son Alfonso, then took control of the kingdom when Alfonso X died in 1284. This was all against the wishes of their father, but Sancho was crowned in Toledo nevertheless.

Sancho&#x27;s ascension was in part due to his rejection of his father&#x27;s elitist politics. Sancho was recognised and supported by the majority of the nobility and the cities, but a sizable minority opposed him throughout his reign and worked for the heirs of Ferdinand de la Cerda. One of the leaders of the opposition was his brother John of Castile, who united to his cause the lord of Biscay, Lope Díaz III de Haro. Sancho responded by executing the Lord of Biscay and incarcerating his brother. According to the chroniclers, he cemented his hold on power by executing 4,000 other followers of Infante Alfonso, son of Ferdinand de la Cerda, in Badajoz. He executed 400 more in Talavera and more in Ávila and Toledo.

Upon dispensing with this opposition, Sancho pardoned his brother, who was released. John bided his time before fomenting revolt again: the conflict over Tarifa. He called in the aid of the Marinids in Morocco and besieged Guzmán the Good in his castle (1291). At this siege the innocent son of Guzmán died in what has been considered a famous act of heroism. Tarifa was faithfully defended until Sancho could rescue it and the Marinids retreated to the Maghreb. The intention of both John and the Sultan of Marinids, to invade, was foiled.

When James II succeeded to the Crown of Aragon, he endeavoured to bind the two crowns more closely and for Christian forces to unite to reconquer the Iberian peninsula from Islam. Indeed, both of James&#x27; predecessors had tried to do likewise. Sancho was also the friend and tutor of Juan Manuel of Castile.

Just before succumbing to a fatal illness (possibly tuberculosis) he appointed his wife, María de Molina, to act as regent for his nine-year-old son, Ferdinand IV. He died on 25 April 1295 in Toledo.

==Family==
Sancho married María de Molina in 1282, but at first their marriage did not have the necessary papal dispensation for two reasons: First, they were distant blood relatives, and second, Sancho had been betrothed as an infant to a rich Catalan heiress named Guillerma Moncada.

Sancho and Maria had the following children:
* Isabella (1283–1328), Married first James II of Aragon and secondly John III, Duke of Brittany
* Ferdinand IV (1285–1312). Married Constance of Portugal.
* Alfonso de Castilla (1286–1291)
* Henry (1288–1299)
* Peter (1290–1319) married Maria daughter of James II of Aragon
* Philip (1292–1327). Married his cousin Margarita de la Cerda, daughter of Alfonso de la Cerda.
* Beatrice (1293–1359). Married Afonso IV of Portugal.

Sancho had three illegitimate children:

By María Alfonso Téllez de Menezes (d. Toro), wife of Juan García, Lord of Ucero:
*Violante Sánchez (died bef. 1327), who held the dowry of Ucero as its lady, married in 1293 Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, Lord of Lemos.
*Teresa Sánchez, who married Juan Alfonso Téllez de Meneses (died 5 May 1304), a Castilian nobleman, 4th Lord of Alburquerque, who became the 1st Count of Barcelos and was the &quot;Mordomo Mor&quot; (high steward) of King Denis I of Portugal, and had female issue. After the death of her first husband, she married Ruy Gil de Villalobos, with whom she had one daughter.

By another woman whose name is unknown, he had:
*Alfonso Sánchez, who married, as his second wife, María Díaz de Salcedo, but died without issue.

<text>Gelsenkirchen (, , ; ) is the 25th-most populous city of Germany and the 11th-most populous in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia with 262,528 (2016) inhabitants. On the Emscher River (a tributary of the Rhine), it lies at the centre of the Ruhr area, the largest urban area of Germany, of which it is the fifth-largest city after Dortmund, Essen, Duisburg and Bochum. The Ruhr is located in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, the second-biggest metropolitan region by GDP in the European Union. Gelsenkirchen is the fifth-largest city of Westphalia after Dortmund, Bochum, Bielefeld and Münster, and it is one of the southernmost cities in the Low German dialect area. The city is home to the football club Schalke 04, which is named after Gelsenkirchen-Schalke. The club&#x27;s current stadium Veltins-Arena, however, is located in .

Gelsenkirchen was first documented in 1150, but it remained a tiny village until the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution led to the economic and population growth of the region. In 1840, when the mining of coal began, 6,000 inhabitants lived in Gelsenkirchen; by 1900 the population had increased to 138,000. In the early 20th century, Gelsenkirchen was the most important coalmining town in Europe. It was called the &quot;city of a thousand fires&quot; for the flames of mine gases flaring at night. In 1928, Gelsenkirchen was merged with the adjoining cities of Buer and . The city bore the name Gelsenkirchen-Buer, until it was renamed Gelsenkirchen in 1930. The city remained a center of coal mining and oil refining during the Nazi era, so was often a target of Allied bombing raids during World War II: nevertheless, over a third of the city&#x27;s buildings date from before World War II. There are no longer coalmines in and around Gelsenkirchen; the city is searching for a new economic basis, having been afflicted for decades with one of the country&#x27;s highest unemployment rates.
== History ==
===Ancient and medieval times===
Although the part of town now called Buer was first mentioned by Heribert I in a document as &quot;Puira&quot; in 1003, there were hunting people on a hill north of the Emscher as early as the Bronze Age – earlier than 1000 BC. They did not live in houses as such, but in small yards gathered together near each other. Later, the Romans pushed into the area. In about 700, the region was settled by the Saxons. A few other parts of town which today lie in Gelsenkirchen&#x27;s north end were mentioned in documents from the early Middle Ages, some examples being: &quot;Raedese&quot; (nowadays &quot;Resse&quot;), Middelvic (&quot;Middelich&quot;, today part of Resse), &quot;Sutheim&quot; (&quot;Sutum&quot;; today part of Beckhausen) and &quot;Sculven&quot; (nowadays &quot;Scholven&quot;). Many nearby farming communities were later identified as (&quot;near Buer&quot;).

It was about 1150 when the name &quot;Gelstenkerken&quot; or &quot;Geilistirinkirkin&quot; appeared up for the first time. At about the same time, the first church in town was built in what is now Buer. This (&quot;church at Buer&quot;) was listed in a directory of parish churches by the sexton from Deutz, Theodericus. This settlement belonged to the Mark. However, in ancient times and even in the Middle Ages, only a few dozen people actually lived in the settlements around the Emscher basin.

===Industrialisation===
Up until the middle of the 19th century, the area in and around Gelsenkirchen was only thinly settled and almost exclusively agrarian. In 1815, after temporarily belonging to the Grand Duchy of Berg, the land now comprising the city of Gelsenkirchen passed to the Kingdom of Prussia, which assigned it to the province of Westphalia. Whereas the Gelsenkirchen of that time – not including today&#x27;s north-end communities, such as Buer – was put in the of Wattenscheid in the Bochum district, in the governmental region of Arnsberg, Buer, which was an in its own right, was along with nearby Horst joined to Recklinghausen district in the governmental region of Münster. This arrangement came to an end in 1928.

After the discovery of coal – lovingly known as &quot;Black Gold&quot; – in the Ruhr area in 1840, and the subsequent industrialisation, the Cologne–Minden Railway and the Gelsenkirchen Main Railway Station were opened. In 1868, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of an within the Bochum district which encompassed the communities of Gelsenkirchen, Braubauerschaft (since 1900, ), Schalke, Heßler, Bulmke and Hüllen.

Friedrich Grillo founded the Corporation for Chemical Industry () in Schalke in 1872, as well as founding Vogelsang &amp; Co. with the Grevel family (later ), and also the Schalke Mining and Ironworks Association (). A year later, and once again in Schalke, he founded the Glass and Mirror Factory Incorporated ().

After Gelsenkirchen had become an important heavy-industry hub, it was raised to city in 1875.

===Independent city===
In 1885, after the Bochum district was split up, Gelsenkirchen became the seat of its own district (&quot;Kreis&quot;), which would last until 1926. The cities of Gelsenkirchen and Wattenscheid, as well as the of Braubauerschaft (in 1900, Bismarck), Schalke, , Wanne and Wattenscheid all belonged to the Gelsenkirchen district. A few years later, in 1896, Gelsenkirchen split off from Gelsenkirchen district to become an independent city (). In 1891, Horst was split off from the of Buer, which itself was raised to city status in 1911, and to an independent city status the next year. Meanwhile, Horst became the seat of its own . In 1924, the rural community of Rotthausen, which until then had belonged to the Essen district, was made part of the Gelsenkirchen district.

In 1928, under the Prussian local government reforms, the cities of Gelsenkirchen and Buer along with the of Horst together became a new called Gelsenkirchen-Buer, effective on 1 April that year. From that time, the whole city area belonged to the governmental district of Münster. In 1930, on the city&#x27;s advice, the city&#x27;s name was changed to &#x27;Gelsenkirchen&#x27;, effective 21 May. By this time, the city was home to about 340,000 people.

In 1931, the Gelsenkirchen Mining Corporation () founded the Gelsenberg Petrol Corporation (). In 1935, the Hibernia Mining Company founded the coal liquefaction plant. Scholven/Buer began operation in 1936 and achieved a capacity of 200,000 tons/year of finished product, mainly aviation base gasoline. After 1937, Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG opened the Nordstern plant for converting bituminous coal to synthetic oil.

===Nazi Germany===
The 9 November 1938 Kristallnacht antisemitic riots destroyed Jewish businesses, dwellings and cemeteries, and a synagogue in Buer and one in downtown Gelsenkirchen. A new downtown Gelsenkirchen synagogue was opened on 1 February 2007.

Gelsenkirchen was a target of strategic bombing during World War II, particularly during the 1943 Battle of the Ruhr and the oil campaign. Three quarters of Gelsenkirchen was destroyed and many above-ground air raid shelters such as near the town hall in Buer are in nearly original form.

Oberst Werner Mölders, the legendary Luftwaffe fighter pilot, was born here.

The Gelsenberg Lager subcamp of the Buchenwald concentration camp was established in 1944 to provide forced labour of about 2000 Hungarian women and girls for Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG. About 150 died during September 1944 bombing raids (shelters and protection ditches were forbidden to them). There was also a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;) in the city.

From 1933 to 1945, the city&#x27;s mayor was the appointed Nazi Carl Engelbert Böhmer. In 1994, the Institute for City History opened the documentation centre &quot;Gelsenkirchen under National Socialism&quot; ().

===After the war===
On 17 December 1953, the went into operation, billed as Germany&#x27;s &quot;first new coking plant&quot; since the war. The Scholven Power Station was built in the late 1960s with further development until 1985, one of the largest in Europe at the time. Its chimneys are among the tallest in Germany. When postal codes were introduced in 1961, Gelsenkirchen was one of the few cities in West Germany to be given two codes: Buer was given 466, while Gelsenkirchen got 465. These were in use until 1 July 1993. The first comprehensive school in North Rhine-Westphalia was opened in 1969. Scholven-Chemie AG (the old hydrogenation plant) merged with Gelsenberg-Benzin-AG to form the new corporation VEBA-Oel AG. In 1987, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass before 85,000 people at Gelsenkirchen&#x27;s Parkstadion. The Pope also became an honorary member of FC Schalke 04.

In 1997, the Federal Garden Show ( or ) was held on the grounds of the disused coalmine in Horst. In 1999, the last phase of the Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park, an undertaking that brought together many cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, was held. Coke was produced at the old Hassel coking works for the last time on 29 September 1999. This marked the shutdown of the last coking plant in Gelsenkirchen, after being a coking town for more than 117 years. In the same year, Shell Solar Deutschland AG took over production of photovoltaic equipment. On 28 April 2000, the Ewald-Hugo colliery closed – Gelsenkirchen&#x27;s last colliery. Three thousand coalminers lost their jobs. In 2003, Buer celebrated its thousandth anniversary of first documentary mention, and FC Schalke 04 celebrated on 4 May 2004 its hundredth anniversary.


===Jewish history===

====19th century====
The Jewish community of Gelsenkirchen was officially established in 1874, relatively late compared to the Jewish Ashkenazi communities in Germany. In a list of 1829 to determine the salary for the Chief Rabbi of Westphalia, , three families were named: the families of Ruben Levi, Reuben Simon, and Herz Heimann families. With the growth of the town during the second half of the 19th century, its Jewish population also grew bigger, with about 120 Jews living in town in 1880, and a synagogue established in 1885. With the growth of the community, a bigger building was built to serve as the community school.

====20th century====
The community continued to grow and around 1,100 Jews were living in Gelsenkirchen in 1901, a number that reached its peak of 1,300 individuals in 1933. At the turn of the 20th century the Reform Jewish community was the most dominant among all Jewish communities in town, and after an organ was installed inside the synagogue, and most prayers performed mostly in German instead of traditional Hebrew, the town&#x27;s orthodox community decided to stop attending the synagogue and tried to establish a new orthodox community, led by Dr. Max Meyer, Dr. Rubens and Abraham Fröhlich, most of them living on Florastraße. In addition, another Jewish orthodox congregation of Polish Jews was found in town. In 1908, a lot on Wanner Straße was purchased and served the community as its cemetery until 1936, today containing about 400 graves. In addition, another cemetery was built in 1927 in the suburb of Ückendorf.

====Nazi Germany====
With the rise of Hitler and National Socialism in 1933, Jewish life in Gelsenkirchen was still relatively unaffected at first. In August 1938, 160 Jewish businesses were still open in town. In October 1938, though, an official ban restricted these businesses and all Jewish doctors became unemployed. In the same month, the Jewish community of the town was expelled. Between 1937 and 1939, the Jewish population of Gelsenkirchen dropped from 1,600 to 1,000. During Kristallnacht, the town&#x27;s synagogue was destroyed, after two thirds of the town&#x27;s Jewish population had already left. On 27 January 1942, 350 among the 500 remaining Jews in town were deported to the Riga Ghetto; later, the last remaining Jews were deported to Warsaw and the Theresienstadt concentration camp.

====The Gelsenkirchen transport====
On 31 March 1942, a Nazi deportation train set out from Gelsenkirchen and, carrying 48 Jews from the town area, made its way to the Warsaw Ghetto. The train was the first to deport Jews to Warsaw and not to Trawniki concentration camp in southern Poland, as used before. After it left Gelsenkirchen, the train was boarded by other Jews from Münster, Dortmund and a few other stops along the way, and mostly by the Jews of Hanover, 500 in number. The arrival of this transport from Westphalia and Upper Saxony was recorded in his diaries by Adam Czerniakov, the last chairman of the Warsaw Ghetto Judenrat. He stated that those older than 68 were allowed to stay in Germany. The majority of these deportees were killed later on the different death sites around modern-day Poland.

====After World War II====
In 1946, 69 Jews returned to Gelsenkirchen and in 1958, a synagogue and cultural centre were built for the remaining community. In 2005, about 450 Jews were living in town. During the last decade of the 20th century, a noted number of Jews came to the town, after emigrating out of the former USSR. This situation made it necessary to extend the synagogue. Eventually, a new and bigger synagogue was built to serve the increasing Jewish community of Gelsenkirchen. The current community practices Orthodox Judaism, even though no family practices it at home. On 16 May 2014, antisemitic graffiti were painted on the town synagogue.

====Sites====
The building at Husemannstraße 75 belonged to Dr. Max Meyer, who built it between 1920 and 1921. A mezuzah sign can still be seen on the top right side of the door. On Florastraße, near Kennedyplatz, (formerly Schalker Straße 45), stands the house of the Tepper family, a Jewish family that vanished during the Holocaust. As part of the national Stolperstein project, five bricks, commemorating the Jewish inhabitants, were installed outside the house.

<text>Human Nature is a 2001 comedy drama film written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry in his directorial debut. The film stars Tim Robbins, Patricia Arquette, Rhys Ifans, Miranda Otto, and Rosie Perez. It tells the story of three people—a writer with hypertrichosis, a man who was raised as a chimpanzee away from civilization, and a psychologist who attempts to socialize the chimpanzee-man into a civilized member of society and tame his more bestial instincts. It was a box-office bomb and received negative to mixed reviews.

It was screened out of competition at the 54th Cannes International Film Festival.

== Plot ==
Three characters are recounting events from their intertwined lives. Puff, a man who was raised as a chimpanzee in the wilderness, makes a testimony in front of Congress. Writer Lila Jute is giving a statement to the police after her arrest. Deceased psychologist Nathan Bronfman addresses an unseen audience in the afterlife. Their stories are told in flash-back.

Lila is a woman with a rare hormonal imbalance which causes thick hair to grow all over her body. During her 20s after a brief freak show gig, Lila decides to leave society and live within nature where she feels free to exist comfortably in her natural state. She writes a successful book about her naked, savage, happy, and free life in the woods embracing nature. Then at age thirty, strong sexual desire causes her to return to civilization and have her hair removed in order to find a partner.

The partner she finds is Dr. Nathan Bronfman, a psychologist researching the possibility of teaching table manners to mice. Lila and Nathan go hiking in the woods one day. Lila sights a naked man acting like an ape in the woods who has lived as a wild animal his entire life. Lila discards her clothes and chases him until he&#x27;s cornered on a tree branch. The man falls off the branch, knocked unconscious. Brought to Nathan&#x27;s lab, the man is named Puff, after Nathan&#x27;s French research assistant Gabrielle&#x27;s childhood dog; a phone call to an unknown person reveals that Gabrielle is actually an American with a fake French accent. First with the help of Gabrielle and later with Lila&#x27;s help, Nathan performs conditioned reinforcement training on Puff, inculcating him with a veneer of fine manners and high culture, in spite of which Puff still has difficulty controlling sexual urges.

To demonstrate his success, Nathan takes Puff on tour. Puff secretly drinks heavily and patronizes prostitutes. Meanwhile, Nathan and Lila&#x27;s relationship deteriorates and he is seduced into an affair by a scheming Gabrielle. Eventually Lila decides to take Puff back into the forest to undo his manners training and return him to his natural state.

Lila and Puff live naked in the woods together until found by a threatening Nathan, who is killed by Puff. Lila turns herself in as the murderer and asks Puff to testify on the waywardness of humanity before he returns to his home in the forest after a brief encounter with his biological mother.

After the reporters and spectators leave, Puff comes back out of the forest and gets into a car with Gabrielle (still with a French accent). They drive off to the city to eat, while Puff looks back thoughtfully at the forest. The ending strongly suggests some unexplained collusion between the two, throwing much of the interpretation of what went on before into question.

At the end of the film, there are two philosophical passages read while the credits appear. The first is an excerpt of William of Ockham from &quot;Opera Theologica&quot; in which Ockham explains his theory of intuitive cognition:

The second is an excerpt of Novum Organum by Francis Bacon in which Bacon discusses inductivism:

== Production ==
Steven Soderbergh was first interested in directing Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s script in late 1996, when Kaufman was still trying to get &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; produced. Soderbergh&#x27;s considerations for casting were for David Hyde Pierce in the role of Nathan Bronfman, Chris Kattan in the role of Puff (likely due to his character Mr. Peepers on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the time), and Marisa Tomei in the role of Lila Jute. He was about to go into pre-production when he was offered &quot;Out of Sight&quot; and after much deliberation he left the project.

== Reception ==
===Box office===
&quot;Human Nature&quot; grossed $705,308 in the United States and Canada, and $869,352 in other territories for a worldwide total of 1.6 million, against a production budget of $8.6 million.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 48% based on 95 reviews, and an average rating of 5.8/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;As quirky as &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; but not as funny, &quot;Human Nature&quot; feels too forced and unengaging.&quot; On Metacritic, it has an average score of 56 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded the film three-stars out of four, lauding the film&#x27;s &quot;screwball charm&quot; and commenting that director Gondry stages the film with a &quot;level of mad whimsy&quot; that feels &quot;just about right&quot;.

In a 2009 review as part of his &quot;Year of Flops&quot; series, critic Nathan Rabin argued that the screenplay, as well as the collaboration between Kaufman and Gondry (the first before &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot;), had all the ingredients for a sharp social satire. Rabin wrote that like Kaufman’s scripts for films like &quot;Eternal Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;, and &quot;Adaptation,&quot; &quot;Human Nature&quot; &quot;uses a fantastical conceit to explore the fresh hell of existence and our desperate attempts to deny who we are and what we want.&quot; However, Rabin stated that Kaufman’s other works&quot;…are grounded in visceral human emotions and feel gloriously, painfully alive, [whereas] &quot;Human Nature&quot; feels strangely hermetic. Ifans, Robbins, and Arquette breathe incredible melancholy, pain, and confusion into their characters, but they cannot make them human. That is perhaps the tragedy of &quot;Human Nature&quot;: Despite its title and abundance of brilliant ideas and clever lines, it feels strangely abstract and theoretical. Rewatching &quot;Human Nature&quot; eight years on, the film’s bone-deep sadness resonates more strongly than its cerebral comedy of manners. It’s a profoundly flawed and strangely affecting film about what Arquette refers to as the &#x27;waywardness of humankind&#x27; and the sublime agony of being human.&quot;

<text>Edsel is a discontinued division and brand of automobiles that was produced by the Ford Motor Company in the 1958 to 1960 model years. Deriving its name from Edsel Ford, son of company founder Henry Ford, Edsels were developed in an effort to give Ford a fourth brand to gain additional market share from Chrysler and General Motors. Established as an expansion of the Lincoln–Mercury Division to three brands, re-christened the Mercury–Edsel–Lincoln Division, Edsel shared a price range with Mercury. The division shared its bodies with both Mercury and Ford.

Competing against Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Dodge, and DeSoto, Edsel was the first new brand introduced by an American automaker since the 1939 launch of Mercury and 1956 launch of Continental, which ended and merged into Lincoln after 1957. In the year leading to its release, Ford invested in an advertising campaign, marketing Edsels as the cars of the future. While 1958 Edsels introduced multiple advanced features for the price segment, the launch of the model line became symbolic of commercial failure. Introduced in a recession that catastrophically affected sales of medium-priced cars, Edsels were considered overhyped, unattractive, distinguished by a vertical grille said to resemble a horse collar, and low quality.

Following a loss of over $250 million, $ in dollars, on development, manufacturing, and marketing on the model line, Ford quietly discontinued the Edsel brand before 1960.

==History==

===Background (1956–1957)===
Ford Motor Company became a publicly traded corporation on January 17, 1956, and thus was no longer entirely owned by members of the Ford family. The company was now able to sell cars according to current market trends following the seller&#x27;s market of the postwar years. Ford&#x27;s new management compared the company&#x27;s roster of makes with that of General Motors and Chrysler, and concluded that Lincoln was competing not with Cadillac, but with Oldsmobile, Buick, and DeSoto. Ford developed a plan to move Lincoln upmarket, with the Continental broken out as a separate make at the top of Ford&#x27;s product line, and to add premium/intermediate vehicles to the intermediate slot vacated by Lincoln.

Ford explained in 1958 that “The Edsel is new but it’s actually the germination of an idea conceived by Edsel Ford who thought years ago that the company should have greater representation in the medium-price range. This idea was furthered by his son, Henry Ford II, in 1948 when another car was proposed to keep abreast of things in the automotive market.”

Marketing research and development for the new intermediate line had begun in 1955 under the code name &quot;E car&quot;, which stood for &quot;experimental car.&quot; Ford Motor Company eventually decided on the name &quot;Edsel&quot;, in honor of Edsel Ford, son of the company&#x27;s founder, Henry Ford despite objections from Edsel&#x27;s son Henry Ford II. The proposed vehicle marque represented the start-up of a new division of the firm, alongside that of Ford itself and the Lincoln–Mercury division, whose cars at the time shared the same bodies.

Ford later claimed to have performed more than adequate, if not superior, product development and market research work in the planning and design of the new vehicle. Ford assured its investors, and the Detroit automotive press, that Edsels were not only superior products, as compared to their Oldsmobile/Buick/DeSoto competition, but the details of their styling and specifications were the result of a sophisticated market analysis and research and development effort, that would essentially guarantee their broad acceptance by the buying public when the cars were introduced.

In November 1956, the Edsel Division of Ford Motor Company was formed to establish a retail organization and dealer network, alongside Ford and Lincoln–Mercury. The Continental Division had ceased to exist several months earlier. With a network of 1,187 Edsel dealers, Ford Motor Company now had approximately 10,000 dealerships between its three divisions, bringing it closer in line with Chrysler, with 10,000 dealers across five brands, and General Motors, with 16,000 across six brands.

===E Day introduction===
Edsels were introduced amid considerable publicity on &quot;E Day&quot;—September 4, 1957. They were promoted by a top-rated television special, &quot;The Edsel Show&quot;, on October 13, but the promotional effort was not enough to counter the adverse initial public reaction to the Edsel&#x27;s styling and unconventional build.

After the launch date, Edsel was described as a &quot;reborn LaSalle,&quot; a General Motors brand that had disappeared in 1940. For months, Ford had been telling the industry press that it &quot;knew&quot;, through its market research, that there would be great demand for the vehicles. Ford insisted that, in the Edsels, it had built exactly the &quot;entirely new kind of car&quot; that Ford had been leading the buying public to expect through its pre-introduction publicity campaign for the cars. In reality, Edsels shared their engineering and bodywork with other Ford models, and the similarities were apparent once the vehicles were viewed firsthand.

==Models==

===1958===

For its inaugural model year, Edsel introduced a seven-model product line, including four sedans and three station wagons. The lower-trim Edsel Ranger and Edsel Pacer shared bodies with Ford Fairlane sedans ( wheelbase) while the higher-trim Edsel Corsair and Edsel Citation shared bodies with the Mercury Monterey and Mercury Montclair sedans ( wheelbase). Sharing its body and wheelbase with Ford station wagons, Edsel had the two-door Edsel Roundup and the four-door Edsel Villager and Edsel Bermuda.

The Edsel model line had multiple design features that were considered innovative. In place of a horizontal strip or a round dial, the speedometer was a rotating dome. In line with aircraft design, the dashboard adopted warning lights for conditions such as low oil level, parking brake engaged, and engine overheating. While not equipped with cruise control, Edsel introduced a speed warning on the speedometer if the driver exceeded a preset speed limit. While a standard column-mounted transmission shifter was offered, as a delete option, Edsel marked the introduction of the Teletouch push-button shifting system, mounted in the steering wheel hub.

Edsels integrated many elements of the Ford Lifeguard safety package into its design. Along with optional seatbelts, Edsels featured a deep-dish steering wheel, double-latched doors, and childproof rear door locks. The model line was among the first to introduce remote-operated trunk opening and self-adjusting brakes.

In the first year, 63,110 Edsels were sold in the United States, and 4,935 were sold in Canada. Though below expectations, this nevertheless represented the second-largest launch for any new car brand to date, exceeded only by the DeSoto introduction in 1929. One four-door Citation model was purchased and delivered in October 1957 to the United Kingdom for Ian Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford. Its current whereabouts is unknown. In January 1958, the free-standing Edsel division was added to Lincoln–Mercury, with the re-christened Mercury–Edsel–Lincoln Division (M–E–L) adopting Edsel sales and marketing operations. As the model year progressed and sales fell under expectations, multiple Edsel-only dealers closed or expanded their brand offerings with the encouragement of Ford Motor Company, including Lincoln–Mercury or imported Ford of Britain and Ford of Germany franchises.

===1959===

For the 1959 model year, Ford revised the market position of Edsel, slotting it between Ford and Mercury. To reflect the marketing change, the Mercury-based Citation was withdrawn and the Corsair became a higher-trim version of the Ranger. The Pacer was also discontinued. The station wagon line was pared down to the Villager wagon, dropping the two-door Roundup and wood-trim Bermuda. While all Edsel sedans used a Ford body, their wheelbase was , 2 inches longer.

In response to the widely negative response to 1958 Edsel exteriors, the exterior of 1959 Edsels underwent a restyling to tone down its appearance. While the vertical center grille made its return, following heavy revision, a redesign of the hoodline integrated the headlamps into a full-width outer grille, visually lowering the hoodline. A similar revision of the rear fascia repositioned the taillamps. Being based on the 1959 Ford, Edsels received the same roof design as the Fairlanes. Although Ford got a new luxury series of cars mid year, the Galaxie, Edsel never got an equivalent series, further eroding its appeal as a medium price automobile.

The 1959 Edsel interior dropped several features to increase its commonality with Ford. The push-button Teletouch transmission controls were withdrawn, alongside the rotating-dome speedometer, as Edsel introduced a slightly restyled version of the Ford Fairlane 500 dashboard. The optional climate control and fully padded dashboard returned. Alongside the use of distinct interior trim from Ford, Edsel had a 70/30 split-bench seatback for Corsairs. In 1967, Ford returned the split-bench seatback on the Ford LTD, continuing it into the 2010s on its full-size cars.

In 1959, Edsel sold 44,891 vehicles in the United States. 2,505 vehicles were sold in Canada.

===1960===
For the 1960 model year, Edsel saw its model line reduced further, offering only the Ranger sedans, hardtop, and convertible alongside the Villager station wagon. Redesigned alongside 1960 Fords, 1960 Edsels were released with a far more muted styling than their 1958 namesake.

Sharing nearly its entire body with Ford, Edsel abandoned its trademark vertical grille in favor of a split grille, similar to the 1959 Pontiac. For the first time, a full-width front bumper was used. While sharing their tailfins with Ford, the rear fascia of Edsels were distinguished by four oblong vertical taillamps. Distinguished primarily by their grille and taillamps, the 1960 Edsels were fitted with model-specific hoods, bumpers, and body-side trim. The four-door Ranger hardtop had no direct Ford equivalent, as it combined the roofline of the Fairlane with the doors of the Galaxie. The two-door hardtop shared its body with the Ford Galaxie Starliner, minus the star emblems on the &quot;C&quot; pillar.

In a design advance, the muffler was relocated from below the passenger compartment to the rear of the car, intended for better muffler protection and less heat and noise intrusion to the passenger compartment.

The 1960 Edsels were produced between October 15 and November 19, 1959. In total, 2,846 vehicles were produced at the Louisville Assembly, except for the pilot prototypes.

===Discontinuation===

Ford announced the end of the Edsel program on November 19, 1959. Production continued until late in November, with 2,846 model year 1960 cars produced. Total Edsel sales were approximately 116,000, less than half the company&#x27;s projected break-even point. The company lost $350 million, the equivalent of $ in dollars, on the venture. Only 118,287 Edsels were built, including 7,440 produced in Oakville, Ontario, Canada. By U.S. auto industry standards, these production figures were dismal, particularly when spread across a run of three model years.

On November 20, 1959, United Press International&#x27;s (UPI) wire service reported that book values for used Edsels had declined by as much as $400, based on condition and age, immediately following the Ford press release. In some newspaper markets, dealers scrambled to renegotiate newspaper advertising contracts involving the 1960 Edsel models, while others dropped the name from their dealerships&#x27; advertising entirely. Ford issued a statement that it would distribute coupons to customers who purchased 1960 models, and carryover 1959 models, prior to the announcement, valued at $300 to $400 toward the purchase of new Ford products to offset the decreased values. The company issued credits to dealers for stock unsold or received, following the announcement.

==Edsel&#x27;s failure==

Historians have advanced several theories in an effort to explain Edsel&#x27;s failure. Popular culture often faults vehicle styling. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; has alleged that poor workmanship was Edsel&#x27;s chief problem. Marketing experts hold Edsels up as a supreme example of the corporate culture&#x27;s failure to understand American consumers. Business analysts cite the weak internal support for the product inside Ford&#x27;s executive offices. According to author and Edsel scholar Jan Deutsch, an Edsel was &quot;the wrong car at the wrong time.&quot;

===&quot;The aim was right, but the target moved&quot;===
Edsels are most notorious for being a marketing disaster. The name &quot;Edsel&quot; became synonymous with the real-life commercial failure of the predicted &quot;perfect&quot; product or product idea. Similar ill-fated products have often been colloquially referred to as &quot;Edsels&quot;. Ford&#x27;s own Sierra model, which launched almost 25 years later, is often compared to Edsels owing to initial buyer antipathy to their perceived radical styling, even though, unlike Edsels, it ultimately became a sales success. Since the Edsel program was such a debacle, it gave marketers a vivid illustration of how &quot;not&quot; to market a product. 

The principal reason Edsel&#x27;s failure is so infamous is that Ford did not consider that failure was a possibility until after the cars had been designed and built, the dealerships established, and $400 million invested in the product&#x27;s development, advertising and launch. Incredibly, Ford had presumed to invest $400 million, well over $4 billion in 21st century dollars, in developing the new product line without any prior study to determine whether such an investment would be prudent or profitable.

The pre-release advertising campaign promoted the cars as having &quot;more YOU ideas&quot;. The teaser advertisements in magazines revealed only glimpses of the cars through a highly blurred lens or wrapped in paper or under tarps. Ford never test marketed the vehicles or their radical styling concepts with potential buyers prior to either the vehicles&#x27; initial development decision, or vehicle shipments to their new dealerships. Edsels were shipped to the dealerships under wraps, and remained so on the dealer lots.

The public also had difficulty understanding exactly what Edsels were, primarily because Ford made the mistake of pricing Edsels within Mercury&#x27;s market price segment. Theoretically, Edsels were conceived to fit into Ford&#x27;s marketing structure as a mid-price model, with the brand slotted in between Ford and Mercury. However, when the cars debuted in September 1957, the least expensive Ranger model was priced within $74 of the most expensive and best-trimmed Ford sedan, and $63 less than Mercury&#x27;s base Medalist model. In their mid-range pricing, Edsel&#x27;s Pacer and Corsair models were &quot;more&quot; expensive than their ostensibly more costly Mercury counterparts. Edsel&#x27;s top-of-the-line Citation hardtop sedan was the only model priced to correctly compete with Mercury&#x27;s mid-range Montclair Turnpike Cruiser model, as illustrated in the chart below. Edsel products were priced from $2,484 () to $3,766 ().

Not only was Edsel competing against its own sister divisions, but model for model, buyers did not understand what the cars were supposed to be—a step above the Mercury, or a step below it.

After introduction to the public, Edsels did not live up to their preproduction publicity, even though many new features were offered, such as self-adjusting rear brakes and automatic lubrication. While Ford&#x27;s market research had indicated that these and other features would make Edsels attractive to them as car buyers, their selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay. Upon seeing the price for a base model, many potential buyers simply left the dealerships. Other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped top-of-the-line model.

===&quot;The wrong car at the wrong time&quot;===
One of the external forces working against the Edsel brand was the onset of an economic recession in late 1957.

Compounding Edsel&#x27;s problems was that the car had to compete with well-established nameplates from the Big Three such as Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick, Dodge, and DeSoto, as well as with its sister division Mercury, which had never been a stellar sales success. To make matters worse, as a new make, Edsel had no established brand loyalty with buyers as its competing makes had.

Even if the 1957–1958 recession had not occurred, Edsel would have been entering a shrinking marketplace. In the early 1950s, when the &quot;E&quot; car was in its earliest stages of development, Ford Executive Vice President Ernest R. Breech had convinced Ford management that the medium-priced market segment offered great untapped opportunity. At the time, Breech&#x27;s assessment was basically correct. In 1955, Pontiac, Buick, and Dodge sold a combined two million units. However, by the fall of 1957, when Edsels were introduced, the market had changed drastically. Independent manufacturers in the medium-priced field were drifting to insolvency. 

Hoping to reverse its losses, Packard acquired Studebaker, which was also in financial difficulty. The board decided to stop production under the venerable Packard badge after 1958. The 1957–58 Packards were Studebaker bodied cars using much Packard styling, also known as &quot;Packardbakers&quot;. Attempting to capitalize on the emerging consumer interest in economy cars, American Motors shifted its focus to its compact Rambler models and discontinued its pre-merger brands, Nash and Hudson, after the 1957 model year. Sales of Chrysler&#x27;s DeSoto marque dropped dramatically from its 1957 high by over 50% in 1958. When DeSoto sales failed to rebound during the 1959 model year, plans were made in Highland Park to discontinue the nameplate by 1961.

Despite the presence and influence of the &quot;whiz kids&quot; in the Ford hierarchy and upon this car, the project epitomized the hazards of &#x27;design by committee.&#x27;

Sales for most car manufacturers, even those not introducing new models, were down. Among domestic makes, only Rambler and Lincoln produced more cars in 1958 than in 1957. Customers started buying more fuel-efficient automobiles, particularly Volkswagen Beetles, which were selling at rates exceeding 50,000 a year in the U.S. from 1957 onward. Edsels were equipped with powerful engines and offered brisk acceleration, but they also required premium fuel, and their fuel economy, especially in city driving, was poor even by late-1950s standards.

Ford Motor Company had conducted the right marketing study, but it came up with the wrong product to fill the gap between Ford and Mercury. By 1958, buyers had become fascinated with economy cars, and a large car like an Edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own. When Ford introduced the Falcon in 1959, it sold over 400,000 units in its first year. Ford&#x27;s investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for Edsels helped make the company&#x27;s subsequent success with the Falcon possible.

By 1965, the market for medium-priced cars had recovered, and this time, Ford had the right car, the Galaxie 500 LTD. The LTD&#x27;s success led Chevrolet to introduce the Caprice as a mid-1965 upscale trim option on its top-of-the-line Impala four-door hardtop.

===&quot;Edsel, a difficult name to place&quot;===
The name of the car, Edsel, is also often cited as a further reason for its lack of popularity. Naming the vehicle after Edsel Ford, former company president and son of Henry Ford, was proposed early in its development. However, the Ford family strongly opposed its use. Henry Ford II declared that he did not want his father&#x27;s good name spinning around on thousands of hubcaps. Ford ran internal studies to decide on a name, and dispatched employees to stand outside movie theaters to poll audiences as to what their feelings were on several ideas. They reached no conclusions.

Ford retained the advertising firm Foote, Cone &amp; Belding to come up with a name. When the agency issued its report, citing over 6,000 possibilities, Ford&#x27;s Ernest Breech commented that they had been hired to develop &quot;one&quot; name, not 6,000. Early favorites for the name brand included Citation, Corsair, Pacer, and Ranger, which were ultimately chosen for the vehicle&#x27;s series names.

David Wallace, manager of marketing research, and coworker Bob Young unofficially invited freethinker poet Marianne Moore for input and suggestions. Moore&#x27;s unorthodox contributions, among them &quot;Utopian Turtletop,&quot; &quot;Pastelogram,&quot; &quot;Turcotinga,&quot; &quot;Resilient Bullet,&quot; &quot;Andante con Moto&quot; and &quot;Mongoose Civique&quot;, were meant to stir creative thought and were not officially authorized or contractual in nature.

By the instruction of Ernest Breech, who was chairing a board meeting in the absence of Henry Ford II, the car was finally called &quot;Edsel&quot;, in honor of Edsel Ford.

===Reliability===
Even though Edsels shared basic technology with other Ford cars of the era, a number of issues caused reliability problems, mostly with the 1958 models. Reports of mechanical flaws with the cars surfaced, due primarily to lack of quality control and confusion of parts with other Ford models. Ford never dedicated a stand-alone factory solely to Edsel model production. The 1958 Edsels were assembled in both Mercury and Ford factories. The longer-wheelbase models, Citation and Corsair, were produced alongside the Mercury products. The shorter-wheelbase models, Pacer and Ranger, were produced alongside Ford products.

Workers assembling Fords and Mercurys often found the task of assembling the occasional Edsel that moved down the production line burdensome, because it required them to change tools and parts bins, then switch back to resume assembling Fords or Mercurys after completing assembly on Edsels. The workers were also expected to accommodate Edsel assembly with no adjustment in their hourly quota of Ford and Mercury production. Consequently, the desired quality control of the different Edsel models proved difficult to achieve, even when the Fords and Mercurys were satisfactorily assembled on the same lines. Many Edsels actually left the assembly lines unfinished. Uninstalled parts were placed in the trunks along with installation instructions for dealership mechanics, some of whom never installed the additional parts at all. Some dealers did not even receive all the parts.

In the March 1958 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, 16% of Edsel owners reported poor workmanship, with complaints ranging from faulty welding to power steering failure. In its test car, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; tested for these problems and discovered others, notably a badly leaking trunk during rain, and the odometer showing fewer than actual miles traveled.

===Design controversies===
====Body design====

Edsel&#x27;s most memorable design feature was its trademark &quot;horsecollar&quot; grille, which was distinct from that of other cars of the period. According to a popular joke at the time, Edsels &quot;resembled an Oldsmobile sucking a lemon&quot;.

According to Thomas E. Bonsall&#x27;s 2002 book, &quot;Disaster in Dearborn&quot;, it was assistant stylist Bob &quot;Robin&quot; Jones who suggested a vertical motif for the front end of the &quot;E-car&quot;.

Edsel&#x27;s front end bore little resemblance, if any, to the original concept. Roy Brown, the original chief designer on the Edsel project, had envisioned a slender, almost delicate opening in the center. Engineers, fearing engine cooling problems, vetoed the intended design, so a ring design was suggested. Ernest Breech then demanded that the grille be taller and wider, which led to the &quot;horsecollar&quot;.
The vertical grille, after being improved for the 1959 models, was discontinued for the 1960 models, which were similar to Ford models of the same year, although coincidentally, the new front end was very similar to that of the 1959 Pontiac.
Complaints also surfaced about the taillights on 1958 Edsel station wagons. The lenses were boomerang-shaped and placed in a reverse fashion. At a distance, they appeared as arrows pointed in the opposite direction of the turn being made. When the left turn signal flashed, its arrow shape pointed right, and vice versa. However, there was little that could be done to give the Ford-based station wagons a unique appearance from the rear, because corporate management had insisted that no sheetmetal could be changed. Only the taillights and trim could be touched. There was room for separate turn signals in addition to the boomerangs, but the U.S. industry had never supplied them up to that point, and they were probably never seriously considered.

====Powertrain features====
The Teletouch pushbutton automatic transmission selector was an extremely complex feature. It proved problematic in part because the steering wheel hub, where the pushbuttons were located, was the traditional location of the horn button. Some drivers inadvertently shifted gears when they intended to sound the horn. While Edsels were fast, the location of the transmission pushbuttons was not conducive to street racing. There were also jokes among stoplight drag racers about the buttons: D for Drag, L for Leap, and R for Race, instead of Drive, Low and Reverse. 

The control wires for Teletouch were also routed too close to the exhaust manifold, which often caused unpredictable movement of the selector mechanism and, in some cases, complete failure. The electrical design required drivers to shift from Park to Reverse to Neutral to Drive, in that order, to avoid overloading the Teletouch motor. The motor was also not powerful enough to bring the car out of Park while on a hill, so dealerships would instruct drivers to set the parking brake before pushing the Park button.

Mechanics of the time were wary of the 410-cubic-inch Edsel &quot;E-475&quot; engine because its perfectly flat cylinder heads lacked distinct combustion chambers. The heads were set at an angle, with &quot;roof&quot; pistons forming both a squish zone on one side and a combustion chamber on the other. Combustion thus took place entirely within the cylinder bore. This design was similar to Chevrolet&#x27;s 348-cubic-inch &quot;W&quot; engine, which was also introduced in 1958. While the design reduced the cost of manufacture and may also have helped minimize carbon buildup, it was also unfamiliar to many mechanics.

===Company politics and the role of Robert McNamara===
Following World War II, Henry Ford II retained Robert McNamara as one of the 10 Ford &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; to help turn Ford around. McNamara&#x27;s cost-cutting and cost-containment skills helped Ford emerge from its near-collapse after the war. As a result, McNamara eventually amassed a considerable amount of power at Ford. McNamara was very much a throwback to Henry Ford in that, like the elder Ford, McNamara was committed to the Ford marque to the almost total exclusion of the company&#x27;s other products. Thus, McNamara had little use for the Continental, Lincoln, Mercury and Edsel brand cars made by the company.

McNamara opposed the formation of the separate divisions for Continental, Lincoln, Mercury, and Edsel cars, and moved to consolidate Lincoln, Mercury, and Edsel into the M-E-L division. McNamara saw to it that the Continental program was canceled and that the model was merged into the Lincoln range for 1958. He next set his sights on Edsel by maneuvering for elimination of the dual wheelbases and separate bodies used for 1958. Instead, Edsels would share the Ford platform and use Ford&#x27;s inner body structure for 1959. 

By 1960, Edsels emerged as little more than a Ford with different trim. McNamara moved to reduce Edsel&#x27;s advertising budget for 1959, and for 1960, he virtually eliminated it. The final blow came in the fall of 1959, when McNamara convinced Henry Ford II and the rest of Ford&#x27;s management that Edsel was doomed and that it was time to end production before Edsel bled the company dry. McNamara also attempted to discontinue the Lincoln nameplate, but that effort ended with Elwood Engel&#x27;s now classic redesign of 1961. McNamara left Ford when he was named Secretary of Defense by President John F. Kennedy.

During the 1964 presidential election, Republican nominee Barry Goldwater blamed McNamara, then Secretary of Defense, for Edsel&#x27;s failure. Eventually, Ford&#x27;s former executive vice president Ernest R. Breech, who was a financial contributor to Goldwater, wrote to the Senator&#x27;s campaign, explaining that &quot;Mr. McNamara ... had nothing to do with the plans for the Edsel car or any part of the program.&quot; However, the charge continued to be leveled against McNamara for years. During his time as head of the World Bank, McNamara instructed his public affairs officer to distribute copies of Breech&#x27;s letter to the press whenever the accusation was made.

The Ho Chi Minh Museum in Hanoi features an Edsel crashing through a wall, intended to symbolically represent US military failure in the Vietnam War. McNamara became the US Secretary of Defense after his career at Ford, and oversaw the escalation of the US military presence in Vietnam.

===Edsels as Mercurys===
====Comet====

While Edsel cost Ford over $250 million in 1958 dollars, the project saw longer-term benefits for the company, as Ford invested over $100 million to build compact cars over the 1960s.

Prior to the closure of the Edsel division, the brand was intending to release the Edsel Comet compact for the 1960 model year, sharing a body with the Ford Falcon. Running prototypes of sedans and station wagons were developed into November 1959, only days before the closure of Edsel. The design was approved for production, with the Comet sold by Lincoln–Mercury under no divisional branding. Though sharing chassis underpinnings and many body stampings with the Falcon, the Comet was stretched to a wheelbase, longer than the GM Y-body &quot;senior compacts&quot;. The Comet adopted multiple design features from the full-size Edsel line, including its oblong taillamp lenses, though canted diagonally, creating its rear tailfins, along with the instrument cluster. Comet keys were styled like Edsel keys, restyling the &quot;E&quot; emblem as a &quot;C&quot;.

While sold without divisional branding, the Comet proved successful; Lincoln–Mercury sold more 1960 Comets than the entire Edsel model line sold through its 1958–1960 existence. For 1962, the Comet was branded as a Mercury; the model line was produced through 1977.

====Meteor====
For 1961, Lincoln–Mercury introduced the Mercury Meteor as its entry-level full-size sedan, slotted below the Mercury Monterey. Beginning life as a design for the 1961 Edsel Ranger, the base trim of the Meteor was designed with oblong taillamps, switching to a horizontal layout, derived from the 1960 Ranger and Comet, designed as an Edsel. For 1962, the full-size Meteor was discontinued, with Mercury shifting the nameplate to its newly introduced intermediate car line, becoming a counterpart of the Ford Fairlane to 1963.

===Design influence===
While the Edsel trademark vertical grille saw a nearly universal negative response by contemporary buyers and critics, multiple subsequent automobile manufacturers have employed narrow vertically oriented grilles with greater success in the marketplace, including Pontiac, Jaguar, Subaru, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, and Saab. The BMW 4 Series (G22) is a contemporary model line with a vertical grille, generating a negative critical response similar to the Edsel.

Through technological advances, multiple features introduced by Edsel cars, including self-adjusting brakes, automatic climate control, steering wheel-mounted transmission controls, and childproof rear door locks are no longer impractical ideas, but included in many current production features as options or standard equipment.

<text>Scapegoating is the practice of singling out a person or group for unmerited blame and consequent negative treatment. Scapegoating may be conducted by individuals against individuals (e.g. &quot;he did it, not me!&quot;), individuals against groups (e.g., &quot;I couldn&#x27;t see anything because of all the tall people&quot;), groups against individuals (e.g., &quot;He was the reason our team didn&#x27;t win&quot;), and groups against groups.

A scapegoat may be an adult, child, sibling, employee, peer, ethnic, political or religious group, or country. A whipping boy, identified patient, or &quot;fall guy&quot; are forms of scapegoat.

Scapegoating has its origins in the scapegoat ritual of atonement described in chapter 16 of the Biblical &quot;Book of Leviticus&quot;, in which a goat (or ass) is released into the wilderness bearing all the sins of the community, which have been placed on the goat&#x27;s head by a priest.

==At the individual level==

A medical definition of scapegoating is:

Scapegoated groups throughout history have included almost every imaginable group of people: genders, religions, people of different races, nations, or sexual orientations, people with different political beliefs, or people differing in behaviour from the majority. However, scapegoating may also be applied to organizations, such as governments, corporations, or various political groups.

===Its archetype===
Jungian analyst Sylvia Brinton Perera situates its mythology of shadow and guilt. Individuals experience it at the archetypal level. As an ancient social process to rid a community of its past evil deeds and reconnect it to the sacred realm, the scapegoat appeared in a biblical rite, which involved two goats and the pre-Judaic, chthonic god Azazel. In the modern scapegoat complex, however, &quot;the energy field has been radically broken apart&quot; and the libido &quot;split off from consciousness&quot;. Azazel&#x27;s role is deformed into an accuser of the scapegoated victim.

Blame for breaking a perfectionist moral code, for instance, might be measured out by aggressive scapegoaters. Themselves often wounded, the scapegoaters can be sadistic, superego accusers with brittle personas, who have driven their own shadows underground from where such are projected onto the victim. The scapegoated victim may then live in a hell of felt unworthiness, retreating from consciousness, burdened by shadow and transpersonal guilt, and hiding from the pain of self-understanding. Therapy includes modeling self-protective skills for the victim&#x27;s battered ego, and guidance in the search for inner integrity, to find the victim&#x27;s own voice.

===Projection===

Unwanted thoughts and feelings can be unconsciously projected onto another who becomes a scapegoat for one&#x27;s own problems. This concept can be extended to projection by groups. In this case the chosen individual, or group, becomes the scapegoat for the group&#x27;s problems. &quot;Political agitation in all countries is full of such projections, just as much as the backyard gossip of little groups and individuals.&quot; Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung considered indeed that &quot;there must be some people who behave in the wrong way; they act as scapegoats and objects of interest for the normal ones&quot;.

==Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict==

The scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict provides an explanation for the correlation between times of relative economic despair and increases in prejudice and violence toward outgroups. Studies of anti-black violence (racist violence) in the southern United States between 1882 and 1930 show a correlation between poor economic conditions and outbreaks of violence (e.g. lynchings) against black people. The correlation between the price of cotton (the principal product of the area at that time) and the number of lynchings of black men by whites ranged from −0.63 to −0.72, suggesting that a poor economy induced white people to take out their frustrations by attacking an outgroup.

Scapegoating as a group necessitates that ingroup members settle on one specific target to blame for their problems.

In management, scapegoating is a known practice in which a lower staff employee is blamed for the mistakes of senior executives. This is often due to lack of accountability in upper management.

==Scapegoat mechanism==

Literary critic and philosopher Kenneth Burke first coined and described the expression scapegoat mechanism in his books &quot;Permanence and Change&quot; (1935), and &quot;A Grammar of Motives&quot; (1945). These works influenced some philosophical anthropologists, such as Ernest Becker and René Girard.

Girard developed the concept much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture. In Girard&#x27;s view, it is humankind, not God, who has need for various forms of atoning violence. Humans are driven by desire for that which another has or wants (mimetic desire). This causes a triangulation of desire and results in conflict between the desiring parties. This mimetic &quot;contagion&quot; increases to a point where society is at risk; it is at this point that the &quot;scapegoat mechanism&quot; is triggered. This is the point where one person is singled out as the cause of the trouble and is expelled or killed by the group. This person is the scapegoat. Social order is restored as people are contented that they have solved the cause of their problems by removing the scapegoated individual, and the cycle begins again.

Scapegoating serves as a psychological relief for a group of people. Girard contends that this is what happened in the narrative of Jesus of Nazareth, the central figure in Christianity. The difference between the scapegoating of Jesus and others, Girard believes, is that in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, he is shown to be an innocent victim; humanity is thus made aware of its violent tendencies and the cycle is broken. Thus Girard&#x27;s work is significant as a reconstruction of the &quot;Christus Victor&quot; atonement theory.

<text>Julius Müller (10 April 1801 – 27 September 1878) was a German Protestant theologian.

==Biography==
He was born at Brieg (now Brzeg, Poland) and studied at Breslau, Göttingen and Berlin – first law, which he later abandoned for theology. From 1825 to 1831, he was in charge of several small parishes. In 1831, he was second university preacher at Göttingen University, and lectured on practical theology and pedagogics. In 1834, he became professor extraordinarius of theology there. From 1835 to 1839 he was professor in Marburg. In 1839 he became professor ordinarius of theology at the University of Halle, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died at Halle.

A disciple of Neander and friend of Richard Rothe, Müller bitterly opposed the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel and the criticism of F. C. Baur. His book, &quot;Über den Gegensatz des Protestantismus und das Catholicismus&quot; (&quot;On the Opposition of Protestantism and Catholicism&quot;, 1833), called forth a reply from Baur, and he was one of those who attacked David Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;.

In 1846, he had been deputed to attend the General Evangelical Synod at Berlin. Here he supported the Consensus-Union and afterwards defended himself in the pamphlets &quot;Die erste Generalsynode der evangelische Landeskirche Preussens&quot; (1847) and &quot;Die evangelische Union, ihr Wesen und göttliches Recht&quot; (1854). In 1848 he helped to found the &quot;Deutsch-Evangelische Kirchentag&quot;, and two years later founded and edited (1850–1861), with August Neander and Karl Nitzsch, the &quot;Deutsche Zeitschrift für christliche Wissenschaft und christliches Leben&quot;.

His chief work, however, was &quot;Die christliche Lehre der Sünde&quot; (&quot;The Christian Teaching of Sin&quot;, 2 volumes, 1839; 5th edition, 1867; English translation from 5th edition), in which he went so far as &quot;to revive the ancient Gnostic theory of the fall of man before all time, a theory which found no favour amongst his theological friends.&quot; Müller&#x27;s other works include &quot;Dogmatische Abhandlungen&quot; (1870), and &quot;Das christliche Leben&quot; (3rd edition, 1847).

==Family==
His brothers were Karl Otfried Müller (1797–1840), an archeologist and philologist, and Eduard Müller (1804–1875), a philologist.

<text>Karl Immanuel Nitzsch (21 September 1787, Borna – 21 August 1868, Berlin) was a German Lutheran church leader. He was the father of theologian Friedrich August Nitzsch.

== Biography ==
He was born in the small Saxon town of Borna near Leipzig. His father, Karl Ludwig Nitzsch, at that time pastor and superintendent in Borna, later (1790) became professor at Wittenberg and director (1817) of the seminary for preachers. He was sent to study at Schulpforta in 1803, going on to the University of Wittenberg in 1806. In 1809 he graduated, and in 1810 he became a &quot;privatdozent&quot; at the university. Having become a deacon at the Schlosskirche in 1811, he showed remarkable energy and zeal during the bombardment and siege of the city in 1813. In 1815 he was appointed a preceptor in the preachers&#x27; seminary which had been established at Wittenberg after the suppression of the university.

From 1820 to 1822 he was superintendent in Kemberg, and in the latter year he was appointed professor ordinarius of systematic and practical theology at Bonn. Here he remained until called to succeed Philip Marheineke at Berlin in 1847; subsequently he became university preacher, rector of the university, provost of St Nicolai (in 1854) and member of the supreme council of the church, in which last capacity he was one of the ablest and most active promoters of the Evangelical Union. He represented the &quot;Vermittelungstheologie&quot; of the school of Friedrich Schleiermacher.

== Published works ==
Nitzsch&#x27;s principal works are: &quot;System der christlichen Lehre&quot; (1829; 6th edition, 1851; English translation: &quot;System of Christian doctrine&quot; 1849), &quot;Praktische Theologie&quot; (1847-1860; 2nd edition, 1863-1868), &quot;Akademische Vorträge über christliche Glaubenslehre&quot; (1858), and several series of sermons. According to Otto Pfleiderer, (&quot;Development of Theology&quot;, p. 123): &quot;He took as his starting-point the fundamental thought of Schleiermacher, that religion is not doctrine but life, direct consciousness, feeling. At the same time he sought to bring religious feeling into closer connection with knowledge and volition than Schleiermacher had done; he laid special stress – and justly – on the recognition of a necessary and radical union of religion with morality, treating both dogmatics and ethics together accordingly in his &quot;System der christlichen Lehre&quot;&quot;. His &quot;Protestantische Beantwortung&quot;, a reply to the &quot;Symbolik&quot; of Johann Adam Möhler (1796-1838), which originally appeared in the &quot;Studien und Kritiken&quot;, of which he was one of the founders, may also be mentioned.

<doc id="179081" wikidata="Q210559" url="?curid=179081" title="Oslo Airport, Gardermoen">
<text>Oslo Airport () , alternatively referred to as Oslo Gardermoen Airport or simply Gardermoen, is an international airport serving Oslo, the capital and most populous city of Norway. A hub for Scandinavian Airlines and an operating base for Norwegian Air Shuttle and Widerøe, in 2011, it connected to 26 domestic and 158 international destinations.

The airport is located northeast of Oslo, at Gardermoen at the border of municipalities Nannestad and Ullensaker, in Akershus county. It has two parallel roughly north–south runways measuring and and 71 aircraft stands, of which 50 have jet bridges. The airport is connected to the city center by the high-speed railway Gardermoen Line served by mainline trains and Flytoget. The percentage of passengers using public transport to get to and from the airport is one of the highest in the world at nearly 70%. The ground facilities are owned by Oslo Lufthavn AS, a subsidiary of the state-owned Avinor. Also at the premises is Gardermoen Air Station, operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. An expansion with a new terminal building and a third pier opened in late April 2017.

The airport location was first used by the Norwegian Army from 1940, with the first military airport facilities being built during the 1940s. The airport remained a secondary reserve and airport for chartered flights to Oslo Airport, Fornebu, until 8 October 1998, when the latter was closed, and an all-new Oslo Airport opened at Gardermoen, costing 11.4 billion Norwegian kroner (NOK).

Oslo is additionally served by the much smaller Sandefjord Torp Airport, which is situated 119 km (74 mi) to the south of downtown Oslo and primarily used by leisure and low-cost carriers.

==History==
===Military and secondary===

The Norwegian army started using Gardermoen as a camp in 1740, although it was called Fredericksfeldt until 1788. It was first used by the cavalry, then by the dragoons and in 1789 by the riding marines. The base was also taken into use by the infantry from 1834 and by the artillery from 1860. Tents were solely used until 1860, when the first barracks and stalls were taken into use. Insulated buildings were built around 1900, allowing the camp to be used year-round. By 1925, the base had eleven camps and groups of buildings. The first flight at Gardermoen happened in 1912, and Gardermoen became a station for military flights.

During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; took over Gardermoen, and built the first proper airport facilities with hangars and two crossing runways, both long. After World War II, the airport was taken over by the Norwegian Air Force and made the main air station. Three fighter and one transport squadron were stationed at Gardermoen.

Braathens SAFE established their technical base at the airport in 1946, but left two years later. Gardermoen also became the reserve airport for Oslo Airport, Fornebu, when the latter was closed due to fog. From 1946 to 1952, when a longer runway was built at Fornebu, all intercontinental traffic was moved to Gardermoen. Gardermoen grew up as a training field for the commercial airlines and as local airport for general aviation. Some commercial traffic returned again in 1960, when SAS received its first Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft, that could not use the runway at Fornebu until it was extended again in 1962. SAS introduced a direct flight to New York in 1962, but it was quickly terminated.

In 1972, capacity restraints forced the authorities to move all charter traffic from Fornebu to Gardermoen. However, SAS and Braathens SAFE were allowed to keep their charter services from Fornebu, so they would not have to operate from two bases. A former hangar was converted to a terminal building and in 1974 passenger numbers were at 269,000 per year. In 1978, SAS started a weekly flight to New York. In 1983, further restrictions were enforced, and also SAS and Braathens SAFE had to move their charter operations to Gardermoen, increasing passenger numbers that year to 750,000. Several expansions of runway were made after the war, and by the 1985-extension the north–south runway was .

===Localization debate===

The first airports to serve Oslo were Kjeller Airport which opened in 1912 and Gressholmen Airport which served seaplanes after its opening in 1926. Norway&#x27;s first airline, Det Norske Luftfartrederi, was founded in 1918 and the first scheduled flights were operated by Deutsche Luft Hansa to Germany with the opening of Gressholmen. In 1939, a new combined sea and land airport opened at Fornebu. It was gradually expanded, with a runway capable of jet aircraft opening in 1962 and a new terminal building in 1964. But due to its location on a peninsula about from the city center and close to large residential areas, it would not be possible to expand the airport sufficiently to meet all foreseeable demands in the future. Following the 1972 decision to move charter traffic to Gardermoen, politicians were forced to choose between a &quot;divided solution&quot; that planners stated would eventually force all international traffic to move to Gardermoen, or to build a new airport.
Gardermoen had been proposed as the main airport for Oslo and Eastern Norway as early as 1946, both by the local newspaper &quot;Romerikes Blad&quot; and by Ludvig G. Braathen, who had just founded Braathens SAFE. In 1970, a government report recommended that a new main airport be built at Hobøl, but stated that the time was still not right. The areas were therefore reserved. During the 1970s, it became a political priority by the socialist and center parties to reduce state investments in Eastern Norway to stimulate growth in rural areas. In 1983, parliament voted to keep the divided solution permanently and expand Fornebu with a larger terminal.

By 1985, traffic had increased so much that it became clear that by 1988 all international traffic would have to move to Gardermoen. The areas at Hobøl had been freed up, and a government report was launched recommending that a new airport be built at Gardermoen, although an airport at Hurum had also been surveyed. However, the report did not look into the need of the Air Force that was stationed at Gardermoen and was therefore rejected by the parliament the following year. In 1988, a majority of the government chose Hurum as their preferred location, and the Minister of Transport Kjell Borgen withdrew from his position. In 1989, new weather surveys from Hurum showed unfavorable conditions. There were large protests from meteorologists and pilots who stated that the surveys were manipulated. Two government committees were appointed, and both concluded that there were no irregularities in the surveys.

Since Hurum could no longer be used, the government again recommended Gardermoen as the location. The Conservative Party instead wanted to build at Hobøl, but chose to support the Labour Party government&#x27;s proposal to get a new airport as quickly as possible. Parliament passed legislation to build the new main airport at Gardermoen on 8 August 1992. At the same time, it was decided that a high-speed railway was to be built to Gardermoen, so the airport would have a 50% public transport market share.
The choice of Gardermoen has spurred controversy, also after the matter was settled in parliament. In 1994, Engineer Jan Fredrik Wiborg, who claimed that falsified weather reports had been made, died after falling from a hotel window in Copenhagen. Circumstances about his death were never fully cleared up and documents about the weather case disappeared. The Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs held a hearing about the planning process trying to identify any irregularities. An official report was released in 2001.

===Construction===
To minimize the effect of using state grants to invest in Eastern Norway, parliament decided that the construction and operation of the airport was to be done by an independent limited company that would be wholly owned by the Civil Airport Administration (Avinor). This model was chosen to avoid having to deal with public trade unions and to ensure that the construction was not subject to annual grants. This company was founded in 1992 as Oslo Hovedflyplass AS, but changed its name in 1996 to Oslo Lufthavn. From 1 January 1997, it also took over the operation of Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company was established with NOK 200 million in share capital. The remaining assets were NOK 2 billion from the sale of Fornebu and NOK 900 million in responsible debt. The remaining funding would come from debt from the state. Total investments for the airport, railways and roads were NOK 22 billion, of which Oslo Lufthavn would have a debt of NOK 11 billion after completion.

At Gardermoen there was both an air station and about 270 house owners that had their real estate expropriated following parliament&#x27;s decision. NOK 1.7 billion were used to purchase land, including the Air Force. It was the state that expropriated and bought all the land and remained land owner, while Oslo Lufthavn leases the ground from the state. The first two years were used to demolish and rebuild the air station. This reduced the building area from , but gave a more functional design.

Construction of the new main airport started on 13 August 1994. The western runway was already in place, and had been renovated by the Air Force in 1989. A new, eastern runway needed to be built. A hill at the airport was blown away, and the masses used to fill in where needed. The construction of the airport and railway required 13,000 man-years. 220 subcontractors were used, and working accidents were at a third of the national average, without any fatalities. The last flights to Fornebu took place on 7 October 1998. That night, 300 people and 500 truckloads transported equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. Oslo Airport was officially opened on 8 October 1998, with the name &quot;Gardermoen.&quot; &quot;Gardermoen&quot; is a compound of the farm name &quot;Garder&quot; and the finite form of &quot;mo&quot; &#x27;moor; drill ground&#x27; (thus &#x27;the moor belonging to the farm Garder&#x27;). The farm is first mentioned in 1328 (&quot;Garðar&quot;), and the name is the plural of Norse &quot;garðr&quot; &#x27;fence&#x27;.

The airlines needed to build their own facilities at Gardermoen. SAS built a complex with , including a technical base, cabin storage, garages and cargo terminals, for NOK 1.398 billion. This included a technical base for their fleet of Douglas DC-9 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80-aircraft for NOK 750 million. The cargo handling facility is and was built in cooperation with Posten Norge. SAS also built two lounges in the passenger terminal. Since Braathens had its technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola, it used NOK 200 million to build facilities. This included a hangar for six aircraft for NOK 100 million.

Parliament decided to build a high-speed airport rail link from Oslo to Gardermoen. The Gardermoen Line connects Oslo Central Station (Oslo) to Gardermoen and onwards to Eidsvoll. This line was constructed for and allows the Flytoget train to operate from Oslo Central station to Gardermoen in nineteen minutes. Just like the airport, the railway was to be financed by the users. The Norwegian State Railways (NSB) established a subsidiary, , which would build and own the railway line, as well as operate the airport trains. The company would borrow money from the state, and repay with the profits from operation. During construction of the Romerike Tunnel, a leak was made that started draining the water from the lakes above. The time and cost to repair the leaks meant that the whole railway line budget was exceeded, and the tunnel would not be taken into use until 1 August 1999. Since the rest of the railway was finished, two trains (instead of the intended six), operated using more time from the opening of the new airport.

The main road corridor northwards from Oslo to Gardermoen is European Route E6. The E6 was widened to six lanes north to Hvam, and to four lanes north to Gardermoen. The E6 runs about east of the airport, so of Norwegian National Road 35 was widened to a four-lane motorway to connect the E6 to the airport. This connection cost NOK 1 billion. After the opening of the airport, National Road 35 was reconstructed west of the airport as a two-lane toll road. Also Norwegian National Road 120 and Norwegian National Road 174 were reconstructed.

===Opening and growth===
The first new airline to start scheduled flights was Color Air operating Boeing 737-300 jets. The low-cost airline took advantage of the increased capacity that Gardermoen created to start competing with SAS and Braathens on the routes to Bergen, Trondheim and Ålesund. This lasted until October 1999, when Color Air filed for bankruptcy. During this time, all three airlines lost large amounts of money, mainly due to low passenger counts. To win the business market, all three wanted to have the most possible departures per day to other cities, which proved to be a financially poor decision, instead of waiting more days in between flights to increase passenger counts per flight.

Gardermoen has had considerable problems with fog and freezing rain, and has several times had a complete close-down. This was also a problem at Fornebu, and reported to be at Hurum as well. On average, there is super cooled rain three times per month during the winter. The use of deicing fluids is restricted since the area underneath the airport contains the Tandrum Delta, one of the country&#x27;s largest uncontained quaternary aquifers (underground water systems). On 14 December 1998, a combination of freezing fog and supercooled rain caused glaze at Gardermoen. At least twenty aircraft engines were damaged by ice during take-off, and five aircraft needed to make precautionary landings with only one working engine. On 18 January 2006, an Infratek deicing system was set up, that uses infrared heat in large hangar tents. It was hoped that it could reduce chemical deicers by 90%, but the technique has proved unsuccessful.

In 1999, Northwest Airlines briefly operated a flight between Oslo and Minneapolis/St. Paul, MN, United States, for several months, before the flight was cancelled due to poor load factors. Northwest had previously served the airport in 1987 with nonstop flights operated with McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40 wide body jetliners several days a week to New York - JFK with continuing direct service to Memphis International Airport (MEM) and Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). In October 2001, the only remaining intercontinental flight, to Newark Airport (EWR), with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) operated Boeing 767–300 aircraft, was discontinued, due to a slump in air travel following the 9/11 attacks. In 2004, Scandinavian Airlines and Continental Airlines (now United Airlines) resumed service on this route using Airbus A330 and Boeing 757-200 respectively. United Airlines suspended winter service on the route in 2015, then discontinued the service completely in 2017. Scandinavian Airlines also started a direct service from Oslo to Miami in 2016.

Also in 1999, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) became the first Asian airline to touchdown in Oslo, commencing its first flights to the city to and from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad. The return flights had a stopover at Copenhagen Airport before continuing onward to Pakistan.

Norwegian Air Shuttle launched flights to Bangkok, New York – JFK, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Oakland (San Francisco), and Orlando with Boeing 787 Dreamliner jetliners and Dubai, Agadir and Marrakech with Boeing 737-800 jets. Three more airlines began service. Thai Airways launched service to Bangkok, Qatar Airways to Doha, and Fly Emirates to Dubai.

In 2012, the airport opened a new VIP terminal exclusively used for the royal family, the prime minister and foreign heads of state and government. According to EUROCONTROL, Gardermoen had the most delays per flight of all airports in Europe in July 2012. As a consequence of the delays, which apparently were caused by a lack of air traffic controllers, several airlines received NOK 100 million in compensation from Avinor.

==Facilities==

The airport covers an area of and is modeled partially on Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, with two parallel runways and a single terminal with two piers on a single line. Oslo Airport is located north-northeast of Oslo city centre.

===Terminal===
The passenger terminal covers . The airport has 72 gates, of which 44 are bridge-connected and 28 are remote stands.

The original west wing of the terminal contains the domestic A-gates. The west wing also connects to the south pier that contains the eight B-gates, all of which lack jet bridges. This south pier was constructed in 2012 to compensate for the gates lost while the north pier was being built, and was intended for demolition after five years, but in 2018 a moving walkway to the pier was installed and Avinor expressed its intention to make the pier permanent. In 2024, the airport started using the south pier for early morning international Schengen area flights. When configured for international flights, the gates are numbered G1 to G8 and accessed by shuttle bus from the international area of the terminal.

The north pier, containing 11 gates, was opened in 2017. It was also the first terminal in the world to receive an &quot;excellent&quot; BREEAM rating. This terminal uses recycled snow from the runways to recover energy for heating and cooling. Nine of the gates are configurable as either domestic C-gates or international Schengen area D-gates. The two northernmost gates are international D-gates only. Passengers using the north pier are directed to the top floor for domestic flights or the lower floor for international flights.

The east pier of the original terminal is for international flights. The gates for Schengen area flights are E-gates while the F-gates for the non-Schengen area are at the easternmost end of the terminal. An expansion to the non-Schengen end of the east pier was opened during the summer of 2022. Four gates near the end of the east pier are flexigates where doors can be opened or closed to switch between Schengen and non-Schengen flights. EU controllers have been somewhat skeptical of the Schengen/non-Schengen flexigates, and there were a few incidents where the wrong doors were opened so that passengers who should have gone through the border control did not.

A notable feature of the airport is that it is &quot;silent&quot;, so announcements for flights are only made in the immediate vicinity of the gate.

Many international passengers connecting to domestic flights have to pick up their luggage, show it to customs and check in the luggage again. Some transit passengers avoid Oslo Airport and look for other routing options because of this. The process of clearing customs before connecting from an international to a domestic flight is not unique for Oslo Airport, as it is the same process used at international airports in the United States and some other countries. Most passengers whose inbound flight is with SAS, Norwegian or Widerøe and who are connecting on a through ticket can instead use the domestic transfer customs process that avoids this, although certain flight origins are excluded.

About half the airport operator&#x27;s income is from retail revenue. There are 20 restaurants providing food or drink service, stores and other services including banks and a post office. In all, are used for restaurants, stores and non-aviation services. The departure duty-free shop is and the largest in Europe. The shop is located in front of the international concourse, taking up a large part of the terminal&#x27;s width. The airport has attempted to funnel all passengers through the duty-free shop. Signs put up to hinder passengers from walking outside the duty-free were removed after criticism in 2008. Arriving passengers have access to a smaller duty-free shop in the baggage claim area.

In addition to the main terminal, the airport operates a VIP lounge for the Norwegian royal family, members of the Norwegian government and members of foreign royal families and governments. The General aviation terminal, located on the west side of the airport, services GA-aircraft, executive jets and ambulance aircraft. The cargo terminal is located just southwest of the main terminal and has seven gates for cargo aircraft.

===Art and architecture===
The airport&#x27;s architects were Aviaplan, a joint venture between the agencies Nordic — Office of Architecture, Niels Torp, Skaarup &amp; Jespersen and Hjellnes Cowi. The main architect was Gudmund Stokke. The terminal building has a light, modern roof that is held up by wooden reefers. The main construction materials are wood, metal and glass. The airlines were required to follow the same design rules for their buildings as the terminal. The new pier is cladded with oak from Scandinavian rainforests, and features low-carbon technologies such as district heating and natural thermal energy to improve sustainability.

The main art on the landside of the airport is &quot;Alexis&quot;, consisting of six steel sculptures in stainless steel created by Per Inge Bjørlo. On the airside, Carin Wessel used of thread to make the impression of clouds and webs, named &quot;Ad Astra&quot;. Anna Karin Rynander and Per-Olof Sandberg cooperated in making two installations: &quot;The Marathon Dancers&quot;, located in the baggage claim area, is a set of two electronic boards that show a dancing person. &quot;Sound Refreshment Station&quot;, of which six are located in the departure areas, are sound &quot;showers&quot; that make refreshing sounds when a person is immediately under them. Sidsel Westbø etched the glass walls. In the check-in area, there are small boxes under the floor with glass ceilings that contain curiosities. As well as the custom-made art, several existing sculptures and paintings were bought. At the National Road 35 and European Route E6 junction, Vebjørn Sand built a statue named the &quot;Kepler Star&quot;. It consists of two internally illuminated Kepler–Poinsot polyhedrons, appearing like a giant star in the sky after dark.

===Runways and air traffic control===
The airport has two parallel runways, aligned 01/19. The west runway 01L/19R is , while the east runway 01R/19L is . Both have taxiways, allowing 80 air movements per hour. The runways are equipped with CAT IIIA instrument landing system and the airport is supervised by a tall control tower. Once departing aircraft are away from the airport, responsibility is taken over by Oslo Air Traffic Control Center, which supervises the airspace with Haukåsen Radar. The airport has two ground radars, on the far sides of each of the runways. Both at the gates and along the taxiways, there is an automatic system of lights that guide the aircraft. On the tarmac, these are steered by the radar, while they are controlled by motion sensors at the gate.

There are three deicing platforms. Both fire stations each have three fire cars, and is part of the municipal fire department. Meteorological services are operated by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, which has 12 weather stations and 16 employees at the airport. This includes Norway&#x27;s first aeronautic information service and a self-briefing room, in addition to briefings from professionals. Restrictions on air movements apply overnight from 23:00 to 06:00, although landing and taking off on the north side is permitted.

===Air station===
The Royal Norwegian Air Force has an air base at Gardermoen, located at the north side of the passenger terminal at Oslo Airport. The base dates from 1994 and houses the 335-Squadron that operates three Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport planes. The airbase also handles nearly all military freight going abroad. The Air Force has a compact building space. The station is built so that it can quickly be expanded if necessary, without having to claim areas used by the civilian section. The military also use the civilian terminals for their passenger transport needs, and send 200,000 people with chartered and scheduled flights from the main terminal each year. The air force station serves as the main entering point for VIPs and officials going to Norway.

==Organisation==

The airport is owned by Oslo Lufthavn AS, a limited company wholly owned by Avinor, a state-owned company responsible for operating 46 Norwegian airports. In 2010, Oslo Lufthavn had a revenue of NOK 3,693 million, giving an income of NOK 1,124 million before tax. The profit from the airport is largely paid to Avinor, which uses it to cross-subsidise operating deficits from smaller primary and regional airport throughout the country. At the end of 2010, Oslo Lufthavn had 439 employees.

The company has a subsidiary, Oslo Lufthavn Eiendom AS, which is responsible for developing commercial real estate around the airport. It owns one airport hotel run by the Radisson Blu chain, the office building and conference center Flyporten, which along with the hotel features 60 conference rooms, and the employee parking lot. A second hotel, Park Inn, was opened in September 2010.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
Gardermoen has direct connections to just over 160 destinations. In addition, there are up to several charter destinations, depending on the season. The domestic network is dominated by Norwegian and SAS, which mainly fly commercially on the main airport network. In addition, Widerøe operates tender routes on a contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications.

The international route network is focused on European destinations. SAS, Norwegian and a number of major European network companies fly with high frequency between Gardermoen and the Nordic capitals, as well as the major cities in Western and Eastern Europe. In addition, it flies directly to a larger number of destinations in the Mediterranean countries, although with somewhat lower frequency and variations in the summer months.

Until 2020, Gardermoen had a relatively large increase in the number of long-distance routes. This growth was largely driven by Norwegian&#x27;s investment in longer routes. When the coronavirus pandemic came to Norway in March 2020, Norwegian had to close down its long-haul fleets after a short time, because there was not a sufficient customer base. However, companies such as Qatar Airways and Emirates also contributed to the long-distance increase. In the spring of 2019, Hainan Airlines opened a direct route between Oslo and Beijing. As of 2019, a number of charter flights were also offered from Gardermoen under the auspices of various travel operators, distributed throughout the year. Among these operators were Ving, Apollo and TUI. During the summer months, destinations around the Mediterranean were best represented until 2020 (especially holiday destinations in Spain, Greece and Turkey), while in the winter, direct flights is offered to intercontinental destinations, for example Cuba, Gambia, Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Mexico and Thailand.


===Cargo===
==Statistics==
Oslo Airport has a catchment area of 2.5 million people, including most of Eastern Norway and 0.3 million people in Sweden. In 2017, Oslo Airport served 27,482,315 passengers, of cargo and 242,555 aircraft movements. In 2017, Oslo Airport was ranked the 19th busiest airport in Europe. It is the second-busiest Nordic airport after Copenhagen Airport. The busiest route is to Trondheim, with over 2 million passengers. Along with the domestic routes to Bergen and Stavanger, and the international routes to Copenhagen and Stockholm, Oslo Airport serves five of the 25 busiest routes in the EEA, all with more than one million passengers.

===Annual traffic===


The following is a list of the 20 busiest routes to and from Gardermoen during 2017.

==Ground transportation==
Situated about from the city center, Oslo Airport offers extensive public transport services. The airport has one of the world&#x27;s highest levels of public transport usage, with a share of nearly 70%.

The Gardermoen Line opened the same day as the airport, and runs in a tunnel below the airport facilities, where Gardermoen Station is located. The Flytoget airport express train operates to Oslo Central Station six times per hour in 19 to 22 minutes, with three services continuing onwards via five intermediate stations to Drammen Station. On Saturdays and Sundays, the trains run three times an hour. The Airport Express Train has a 34% ground transport share.

Vy also operates from the airport, both a commuter train service to Eidsvoll and Kongsberg, and a regional service north to Innlandet and south to Vestfold og Telemark. Both offer services to Oslo, and the latter allows direct service to Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Five daily express trains operated by SJ Norge to Trondheim stop at the airport, including one night train.

The Oslo Airport Express Coach serves the airport, from Oslo, Fredrikstad, Sarpsborg, Ski and Gjøvik. In addition, most express buses from other parts of Norway stop at the airport. The local transport authority, Ruter, operates a number of services to Oslo Airport from nearby places.

The airport is located from European Route E16, and from the European Route E6 and connect to them as a four-lane motorway. The E6 runs south with four lanes to Oslo, and northwards with four lanes towards Oppland, Hedmark and Central Norway. E16 connects with two lanes westward towards Buskerud and eastward towards Sweden. All these directions are toll roads, at least in part. There are 11,400 parking spaces at the airport, as well as taxi stands and rental car facilities.

Taxi

There are several companies providing services at Oslo Airport. In order to check companies, rates and book a taxi, the passenger must go to the information desk at the Arrivals Hall of the airport.

== Plans ==
Oslo Airport has experienced rapid increases in passenger numbers during the last decade, already exceeding its original capacity limit of 17 million passengers. As a result, the Norwegian Air Transport Authority, Avinor, approved plans on 19 January 2011, for an expansion of OSL with Terminal 2 (North Pier). Finished in Spring 2017, the expansion involved construction of a new pier located directly after security checkpoint with eleven new air bridges, six remote stands, a new arrivals- and departure-hall and a new baggage handling system. The expansion doubled the size of the terminal from 148,000 square meters to 265,000 square meters. OSL can now handle 32 million passengers annually, which was 19 million before the expansion. Yet, before the North Pier was finished, OSL have invested further plans to expand the international terminal with six new wide-body airliner gates for more direct flights to destinations outside of Europe. The expansion began in 2017 and was finished in 2022.
Once the intercontinental expansion is finished, the airport will be able to accommodate the double-decker Airbus A380. This fixed the major issue where Norwegians were traveling to larger hub airport Europe in order to reach their final destination, because OSL (both the market and airport&#x27;s size) was to handle a global flight network, so many passengers had to use connecting flights. Another phase will be added later on to bring the total capacity to 35 million passengers annually through the T2-project.
If passenger traffic continues to grow and if the capacity will be surpassed beyond the capabilities, OSL and Avinor will call out for a master phase (as situated in the Master Plan 2012–2050), including extension of the North Pier by another 100 meters, adding a third runway with a free-standing pier between it and the existing Eastern runway, as well as a new terminal to the southeast area of the current international terminal (by where Park Inn is located).
The Government of Oslo has debated if a third runway in the future will be reliable. If they approve, the runway will not be finished until 2030 at the earliest. Avinor has discovered the existing runway capacity will be saturated by 2030, but critics have pointed out that larger hubs such as Heathrow in London only operate with two runways. However, such airports tend to suffer from major delays and have chaotic schedules. Oslo had 253,542 movements against 474,087 at Heathrow in 2017. Former Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete (Center), has stated that spreading the traffic between the two airports (RYG is closed on permanent basis) will result in inconvenience for passengers and a massive need for inter-airport ground transportation, but has announced she is opposed to a third runway. Avinor is facing large costs of extending short runways in rural locations or replacing such airports during the 2020s decade, so a third runway at Oslo is less prioritized. However, as of December 2017, construction of a nearby city directly to the east of OSL has been officially approved, nicknamed &quot;the Gate to Europe&quot;, in which a third runway and a third terminal are part of the project.

Norwegian CEO Bjørn Kjos has announced that the airline has ambitions to evolve Gardermoen into a major global hub between North America and South Asia. Kjos stated; &quot;We could have received tons of traffic from all around the world. Oslo could have been one of the largest hubs in Europe, and could have competed against the large ones in the Middle East&quot; (DXB and DOH). He guarantees the transatlantic routes will be significantly shorter via Northern Europe, which will lead to increased efficiency and satisfaction for the travelers and for the economy. Norwegian is currently disallowed to fly direct over Russian territory by their Air Traffic Authorities, meaning that negotiation is the only solution.

<text>SPSS Statistics is a statistical software suite developed by IBM for data management, advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, and criminal investigation. Long produced by SPSS Inc., it was acquired by IBM in 2009. Versions of the software released since 2015 have the brand name IBM SPSS Statistics.

The software name originally stood for Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), reflecting the original market, then later changed to Statistical Product and Service Solutions.

==Overview==
SPSS is a widely used program for statistical analysis in social science. It is also used by market researchers, health researchers, survey companies, government, education researchers, industries, marketing organizations, data miners, and others. The original SPSS manual (Nie, Bent &amp; Hull, 1970) has been described as one of &quot;sociology&#x27;s most influential books&quot; for allowing ordinary researchers to do their own statistical analysis. In addition to statistical analysis, data management (case selection, file reshaping and creating derived data) and data documentation (a metadata dictionary is stored in the datafile) are features of the base software.

The many features of SPSS Statistics are accessible via pull-down menus or can be programmed with a proprietary 4GL &quot;command syntax language&quot;. Command syntax programming has the benefits of reproducible output, simplifying repetitive tasks, and handling complex data manipulations and analyses. Additionally, some complex applications can only be programmed in syntax and are not accessible through the menu structure. The pull-down menu interface also generates command syntax: this can be displayed in the output, although the default settings have to be changed to make the syntax visible to the user. They can also be pasted into a syntax file using the &quot;paste&quot; button present in each menu. Programs can be run interactively or unattended, using the supplied Production Job Facility.

A &quot;macro&quot; language can be used to write command language subroutines. A Python programmability extension can access the information in the data dictionary and data and dynamically build command syntax programs. This extension, introduced in SPSS 14, replaced the less functional SAX Basic &quot;scripts&quot; for most purposes, although SaxBasic remains available. In addition, the Python extension allows SPSS to run any of the statistics in the free software package R. From version 14 onwards, SPSS can be driven externally by a Python or a VB.NET program using supplied &quot;plug-ins&quot;. (From version 20 onwards, these two scripting facilities, as well as many scripts, are included on the installation media and are normally installed by default.)

SPSS Statistics places constraints on internal file structure, data types, data processing, and matching files, which together considerably simplify programming. SPSS datasets have a two-dimensional table structure, where the rows typically represent cases (such as individuals or households) and the columns represent measurements (such as age, sex, or household income). Only two data types are defined: numeric and text (or &quot;string&quot;). All data processing occurs sequentially case-by-case through the file (dataset). Files can be matched one-to-one and one-to-many, but not many-to-many. In addition to that cases-by-variables structure and processing, there is a separate Matrix session where one can process data as matrices using matrix and linear algebra operations.

The graphical user interface has two views which can be toggled. The &#x27;Data View&#x27; shows a spreadsheet view of the cases (rows) and variables (columns). Unlike spreadsheets, the data cells can only contain numbers or text, and formulas cannot be stored in these cells. The &#x27;Variable View&#x27; displays the metadata dictionary, where each row represents a variable and shows the variable name, variable label, value label(s), print width, measurement type, and a variety of other characteristics. Cells in both views can be manually edited, defining the file structure and allowing data entry without using command syntax. This may be sufficient for small datasets. Larger datasets such as statistical surveys are more often created in data entry software, or entered during computer-assisted personal interviewing, by scanning and using optical character recognition and optical mark recognition software, or by direct capture from online questionnaires. These datasets are then read into SPSS.

SPSS Statistics can read and write data from ASCII text files (including hierarchical files), other statistics packages, spreadsheets and databases. It can also read and write to external relational database tables via ODBC and SQL.

Statistical output is to a proprietary file format (*.spv file, supporting pivot tables) for which, in addition to the in-package viewer, a stand-alone reader can be downloaded. The proprietary output can be exported to text or Microsoft Word, PDF, Excel, and other formats. Alternatively, output can be captured as data (using the OMS command), as text, tab-delimited text, PDF, XLS, HTML, XML, SPSS dataset or a variety of graphic image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP and EMF).
Several variants of SPSS Statistics exist. SPSS Statistics Gradpacks are highly discounted versions sold only to students. SPSS Statistics Server is a version of the software with a client/server architecture. Add-on packages can enhance the base software with additional features (examples include complex samples, which can adjust for clustered and stratified samples, and custom tables, which can create publication-ready tables). SPSS Statistics is available under either an annual or a monthly subscription license.

Version 25 of SPSS Statistics launched on August 8, 2017. This added new and advanced statistics, such as random effects solution results (GENLINMIXED), robust standard errors (GLM/UNIANOVA), and profile plots with error bars within the Advanced Statistics and Custom Tables add-on. V25 also includes new Bayesian statistics capabilities, a method of statistical inference, and publication ready charts, such as powerful new charting capabilities, including new default templates and the ability to share with Microsoft Office applications.

SPSS was released in its first version in 1968 as the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) after being developed by Norman H. Nie, Dale H. Bent, and C. Hadlai Hull. Those principals incorporated as SPSS Inc. in 1975. Early versions of SPSS Statistics were written in Fortran and designed for batch processing on mainframes, including for example IBM and ICL versions, originally using punched cards for data and program input. A processing run read a command file of SPSS commands and either a raw input file of fixed-format data with a single record type, or a &#x27;getfile&#x27; of data saved by a previous run. To save precious computer time an &#x27;edit&#x27; run could be done to check command syntax without analysing the data. From version 10 (SPSS-X) in 1983, data files could contain multiple record types.

Prior to SPSS 16.0, different versions of SPSS were available for Windows, Mac OS X and Unix.

SPSS Statistics version 13.0 for Mac OS X was not compatible with Intel-based Macintosh computers, due to the Rosetta emulation software causing errors in calculations. SPSS Statistics 15.0 for Windows needed a downloadable hotfix to be installed in order to be compatible with Windows Vista.

From version 16.0, the same version runs under Windows, Mac, and Linux. The graphical user interface is written in Java. The Mac OS version is provided as a Universal binary, making it fully compatible with both PowerPC and Intel-based Mac hardware.

SPSS Inc announced on July 28, 2009, that it was being acquired by IBM for US$1.2 billion. Because of a dispute about ownership of the name &quot;SPSS&quot;, between 2009 and 2010, the product was referred to as PASW (Predictive Analytics SoftWare). As of January 2010, it became &quot;SPSS: An IBM Company&quot;. Complete transfer of business to IBM was done by October 1, 2010. By that date, SPSS: An IBM Company ceased to exist. IBM SPSS is now fully integrated into the IBM Corporation, and is one of the brands under IBM Software Group&#x27;s Business Analytics Portfolio, together with IBM Algorithmics, IBM Cognos and IBM OpenPages.

Companion software in the &quot;IBM SPSS&quot; family are used for data mining and text analytics (IBM SPSS Modeler), realtime credit scoring services (IBM SPSS Collaboration and Deployment Services), and structural equation modeling (IBM SPSS Amos).

SPSS Data Collection and SPSS Dimensions were sold in 2015 to UNICOM Systems, Inc., a division of UNICOM Global, and merged into the integrated software suite UNICOM Intelligence (survey design, survey deployment, data collection, data management and reporting).

=== (Interactive Data Analysis)===
IDA (Interactive Data Analysis) was a software package that originated at what was formerly the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), at the University of Chicago. Initially offered on the HP-2000, somewhat later, under the ownership of SPSS, it was also available on MUSIC/SP. Regression analysis was one of &quot;IDA&quot;&#x27;s strong points.

=== - Conversational / Columnar SPSS===
SCSS was a software product intended for online use of IBM mainframes.
Although the &quot;C&quot; was for &quot;conversational&quot;, it also represented a distinction regarding how the data was stored: it used a column-oriented rather than a row-oriented (internal) database.

This gave good interactive response time for the SPSS Conversational Statistical System (SCSS), whose strong point, as with SPSS, was Cross-tabulation.

=== Project NX ===
In October, 2020 IBM announced the start of an Early Access Program for the &quot;New SPSS Statistics&quot;, codenamed Project NX. It contains &quot;many of your favorite SPSS capabilities presented in a new easy to use interface, with integrated guidance, multiple tabs, improved graphs and much more&quot;.

In December, 2021, IBM opened up the Early Access Program for the next generation of SPSS Statistics for more users and shared more visuals about it.

<text>Edouard Guillaume Eugène Reuss (; 18 July 1804 – 15 April 1891) was a Protestant theologian from Alsace.

==Life==

He was born at Strasbourg, where he studied philology (1819–22). He went on to study theology at Göttingen under Johann Gottfried Eichhorn; and Oriental Languages at Halle under Wilhelm Gesenius, and afterwards at Paris under Silvestre de Sacy (1827–28). In 1828 he became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Strasbourg. From 1829 to 1834 he taught Biblical criticism and Oriental languages at the Strasbourg Theological School; he then became assistant, and afterwards, in 1836, regular professor of theology at that university. He became Professor of Old Testament at the same institution in 1864. Reuss was appointed as a regular member of the in May 1846. The sympathies of Reuss were German rather than French, and after the annexation of Alsace to Germany he remained at Strasbourg, and retained his professorship till he retired on a pension in 1888. He died in the same city.

Reuss belonged to the liberals in the Lutheran Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine. His critical position was to some extent that of K. H. Graf and Julius Wellhausen: he was in a sense their forerunner, and was actually for a time Graf&#x27;s teacher. The originator of the new movement, he hesitated to publish the results of his studies.

His son, Ernst Rudolf (1841–1924), was in 1873 appointed city librarian at Strasbourg.

==Works==

Amongst his earliest works were: &quot;De libris veteris Testamenti apocryphis plebi non negandis&quot; (1829), &quot;Ideen zur Einleitung in das Evangelium Johannis&quot; (1840) and &quot;Die Johanneische Theologie&quot; (1847). In 1852 he published his &quot;Histoire de la théologie chrétienne au siècle apostolique&quot;, which was followed in 1863 by &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du canon des saintes écritures dans l&#x27;église chrétienne&quot;. In 1874 he began to publish his translation of the Bible, &quot;La Bible, nouvelle traduction avec commentaire&quot;. New Testament criticism and exegesis formed the subject of Reuss&#x27;s earlier labours—in 1842, he had published in German a history of the books of the New Testament, &quot;Geschichte der heiligen Schriften N. Test.&quot;; and though his own views were liberal, he opposed those of the Tübingen school. After a time he turned his attention to Old Testament criticism, based on knowledge of Hebrew. In 1881 he published in German his &quot;Geschichte der heiligen Schriften A. Test.&quot;, a history of Israel from its earliest beginning till the taking of Jerusalem by Titus.

For many years Reuss edited with A. H. Cunitz the &quot;Beiträge zu den theologischen Wissenschaften&quot;. With A. H. Cunitz and J. W. Baum (1809–1878), and after their death alone, he edited the monumental edition of Calvin&#x27;s works (38 vols., 1863 ff.). His critical edition of the Old Testament appeared a year after his death.

<text>The Rat Pack was an informal group of singers that, in its second iteration, ultimately made films and appeared together in Las Vegas casino venues. They originated in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a group of A-list show business friends, such as Errol Flynn, Nat King Cole, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra and others who met casually at the Holmby Hills home of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. In the 1960s, the group featured Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop, and (before falling out with Sinatra in 1962) Peter Lawford, among others. They appeared together on stage and in films in the 1950s and 1960s, including the films &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; and &quot;Sergeants 3&quot;; after Lawford&#x27;s expulsion, they filmed &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; with Bing Crosby in what was to have been Lawford&#x27;s role. Sinatra, Martin, and Davis were regarded as the group&#x27;s lead members after Bogart&#x27;s death.

==1950s==
The name &quot;Rat Pack&quot; was first used to call a group of friends in New York City, and several explanations have been offered for the name. According to one version, Lauren Bacall saw her husband Humphrey Bogart and his friends returning from a night in Las Vegas and said, &quot;You look like a goddamn rat pack.&quot; &quot;Rat Pack&quot; may also be a shortened version of &quot;Holmby Hills Rat Pack&quot;, a reference to the home of Bogart and Bacall which served as a regular hangout of the same group of friends during the late 1940s and early 1950s.
Visiting members included Errol Flynn, Ava Gardner, Nat King Cole, Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis, Mickey Rooney, Lena Horne, Jerry Lewis, and Cesar Romero. According to Stephen Bogart, the original members of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack were Frank Sinatra (pack master), Judy Garland (first vice-president), Sid Luft (cage master), Bogart (rat in charge of public relations), Swifty Lazar (recording secretary and treasurer), Nathaniel Benchley (historian), David Niven, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, George Cukor, Cary Grant, Rex Harrison, and Jimmy Van Heusen. The Rat Pack group underwent several transformations. The publicly best-known transformation happened under the leadership of Frank Sinatra.

After Bogart&#x27;s death in 1957, Frank Sinatra and Lauren Bacall became engaged and planned a marriage while living together in Sinatra&#x27;s homes. Frank Sinatra became the Rat Pack leader from 1957 on. By the end of the 1950s, the Rat Pack evolved into an informal production group whose members united their star power to support each other&#x27;s careers. At that time, the Rat Pack activities expanded to Las Vegas where members performed regular gigs and helped each other by making unannounced appearances to impress the audiences. In 1958, three Rat Pack members, Sinatra, Martin, and Shirley MacLaine starred in &quot;Some Came Running&quot; that was popular with the public. At the same time in 1958, a story about a series of Las Vegas casino robberies circulated among entertainers, so Peter Lawford bought the rights and Frank Sinatra became interested in the idea. Several members of the Rat Pack who were regulars in Vegas, were naturally fit to lead the cast of characters in the upcoming production, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop, and also Angie Dickinson, Cesar Romero, and Shirley MacLaine. A variety of writers worked on the project, titled &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, and the production was set to begin in January 1960.

==1960s==
The film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot;, made between January and March of 1960, shows several members of the Rat Pack group as they were in the late 1950s and early 1960s. This was the second incarnation of the Rat Pack under the leadership of Frank Sinatra.

The early 1960s version of the group included Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, and Joey Bishop. This group was originally known as the &quot;Clan&quot;, but that name fell out of favor because it was reminiscent of the Ku Klux Klan.

Marilyn Monroe, Angie Dickinson, Juliet Prowse, Buddy Greco, and Shirley MacLaine were often referred to as the &quot;Rat Pack Mascots&quot;. 

Comedian Don Rickles wrote that &quot;I never received an official membership card but Frank made me feel part of the fun.&quot;

Peter Lawford was a brother-in-law of President John F. Kennedy (dubbed &quot;Brother-in-Lawford&quot; by Sinatra), and Kennedy spent time with Sinatra and the others when he visited Las Vegas, during which members sometimes referred to the group as &quot;the Jack Pack&quot;. Rat Pack members played a role in campaigning for Kennedy and the Democrats, appearing at the July 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Lawford asked Sinatra if he would have Kennedy as a guest at his Palm Springs house in March 1962 and Sinatra went to great lengths to accommodate the President, including the construction of a helipad. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy advised his brother to sever ties to Sinatra because of his association with Mafia figures such as Sam Giancana and he canceled the visit. Kennedy instead stayed at Bing Crosby&#x27;s estate, which further infuriated Sinatra. Lawford was blamed for this and Sinatra &quot;never again had a good word&quot; for him. Lawford&#x27;s role was written out of the upcoming &quot;4 for Texas&quot;, and his part in &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; was given to Bing Crosby.

==Revival==
Sinatra, Davis, and Martin announced a 29-date tour called &quot;Together Again&quot; in December 1987. At the press conference to announce the tour, Martin joked about calling it off, and Sinatra rebuked a reporter for using the term &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, referring to it as &quot;that stupid phrase&quot;.

Dean Martin&#x27;s son Dean Paul Martin died in a plane crash in March 1987 on the San Gorgonio Mountain in California, the same mountain where Sinatra&#x27;s mother was killed in a plane crash ten years earlier. Martin had since become increasingly dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs. Davis had hip replacement surgery two years previously, and was estranged from Sinatra because of Davis&#x27;s use of cocaine. Davis was also experiencing severe financial difficulties, and was promised by Sinatra&#x27;s people that he could earn between six and eight million dollars from the tour.

Martin had not made a film or recorded since 1984 and Sinatra felt that the tour would be good for Martin, telling Davis, &quot;I think it would be great for Dean. Get him out. For that alone it would be worth doing&quot;. Sinatra and Davis still performed regularly, yet they had not recorded for several years. Both Sinatra and Martin had made their last film appearances together in 1984&#x27;s &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, which also starred Davis. This marked the trio&#x27;s first feature film appearance since 1964&#x27;s &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot;. Martin expressed reservations about the tour, wondering whether they could draw as many people as they had in the past. Sinatra and Davis complained during private rehearsals about the lack of black musicians in the orchestra. The tour began at the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena on March 13, 1988, to a sold-out crowd of 14,500.

Davis opened the show, followed by Martin and then Sinatra; after an interval, the three performed a medley of songs. During the show, Martin threw a lit cigarette at the audience. He withdrew from the tour after just five shows, citing a flare-up of a kidney problem. Sinatra and Davis continued the tour under the title &quot;The Ultimate Event&quot; with Liza Minnelli replacing Martin as the third member of the trio.

Davis&#x27;s associate stated that Sinatra&#x27;s people were skimming the top of the revenues from the concerts, as well as stuffing envelopes full of cash into suitcases after the performances. In August 1989, Davis was diagnosed with throat cancer which caused his death in May 1990. He was buried with a gold watch that Sinatra had given him at the conclusion of &quot;The Ultimate Event Tour&quot;.

A 1988 performance of &quot;The Ultimate Event&quot; in Detroit was recorded and shown on Showtime the following year as a tribute to the recently deceased Davis. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Davis&#x27;s performance, describing it as &quot;pure, ebullient, unapologetic show business.&quot;

Concerning the group&#x27;s reputation for womanizing and heavy drinking, Joey Bishop stated in a 1998 interview: &quot;I never saw Frank, Dean Martin, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances. That was only a gag! And do you believe these guys had to chase broads? They had to chase &#x27;em away!&quot;

Archival footage of Lawford and Sinatra was used in the 1974 compilation film &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot;.

Shirley MacLaine appeared in the 1958 film &quot;Some Came Running&quot;, along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 Oscar-winning film &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate David Niven, and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his face toward the camera during a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich and George Raft. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in &quot;Can-Can&quot;. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; as a drunken woman. The 1984 film &quot;Cannonball Run II&quot;, with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.

A biopic titled &quot;The Rat Pack&quot;, made by HBO in 1998, starred Ray Liotta as Sinatra, Joe Mantegna as Martin, and Don Cheadle as Davis, dramatizing their private lives and, in particular, their roles in the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy.

==Music==
&quot;Christmas with the Rat Pack&quot;, a collection of holiday tunes sung by Sinatra, Martin and Davis, was released in 2001. &quot;The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection: Live &amp; Swingin&#x27;&quot; went on sale in 2003. A concert featuring the three men, &quot;Live from the Sands&quot; in Las Vegas, is also 
available on CD.

==Stage==
&quot;The Rat Pack: Live from Las Vegas&quot; tribute show originated on stage in London in 2000 and has been running continuously since then throughout Europe and North America.

<doc id="179092" wikidata="Q215948" url="?curid=179092" title="Neurolinguistics">
<text>Neurolinguistics is the study of neural mechanisms in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language. As an interdisciplinary field, neurolinguistics draws methods and theories from fields such as neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive science, communication disorders and neuropsychology. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in psycholinguistics and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modeling.

==History==
Neurolinguistics is historically rooted in the development in the 19th century of aphasiology, the study of linguistic deficits (aphasias) occurring as the result of brain damage. Aphasiology attempts to correlate structure to function by analyzing the effect of brain injuries on language processing. One of the first people to draw a connection between a particular brain area and language processing was Paul Broca, a French surgeon who conducted autopsies on numerous individuals who had speaking deficiencies, and found that most of them had brain damage (or &quot;lesions&quot;) on the left frontal lobe, in an area now known as Broca&#x27;s area. Phrenologists had made the claim in the early 19th century that different brain regions carried out different functions and that language was mostly controlled by the frontal regions of the brain, but Broca&#x27;s research was possibly the first to offer empirical evidence for such a relationship, and has been described as &quot;epoch-making&quot; and &quot;pivotal&quot; to the fields of neurolinguistics and cognitive science. Later, Carl Wernicke, after whom Wernicke&#x27;s area is named, proposed that different areas of the brain were specialized for different linguistic tasks, with Broca&#x27;s area handling the motor production of speech, and Wernicke&#x27;s area handling auditory speech comprehension. The work of Broca and Wernicke established the field of aphasiology and the idea that language can be studied through examining physical characteristics of the brain. Early work in aphasiology also benefited from the early twentieth-century work of Korbinian Brodmann, who &quot;mapped&quot; the surface of the brain, dividing it up into numbered areas based on each area&#x27;s cytoarchitecture (cell structure) and function; these areas, known as Brodmann areas, are still widely used in neuroscience today.

The coining of the term neurolinguistics in the late 1940s and 1950s is attributed to Edith Crowell Trager, Henri Hecaen and Alexandr Luria. Luria&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;Basic Problems of Neurolinguistics&quot; is likely the first book with &quot;neurolinguistics&quot; in the title. Harry Whitaker popularized neurolinguistics in the United States in the 1970s, founding the journal &quot;Brain and Language&quot; in 1974.

Although aphasiology is the historical core of neurolinguistics, in recent years the field has broadened considerably, thanks in part to the emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as PET and fMRI) and time-sensitive electrophysiological techniques (EEG and MEG), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks. Electrophysiological techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the N400, a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension. The N400 was the first language-relevant event-related potential to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.

==Discipline==
===Interaction with other fields===
Neurolinguistics is closely related to the field of psycholinguistics, which seeks to elucidate the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology. Today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.

Much work in neurolinguistics involves testing and evaluating theories put forth by psycholinguists and theoretical linguists. In general, theoretical linguists propose models to explain the structure of language and how language information is organized, psycholinguists propose models and algorithms to explain how language information is processed in the mind, and neurolinguists analyze brain activity to infer how biological structures (populations and networks of neurons) carry out those psycholinguistic processing algorithms. For example, experiments in sentence processing have used the ELAN, N400, and P600 brain responses to examine how physiological brain responses reflect the different predictions of sentence processing models put forth by psycholinguists, such as Janet Fodor and Lyn Frazier&#x27;s &quot;serial&quot; model, and Theo Vosse and Gerard Kempen&#x27;s &quot;unification model&quot;. Neurolinguists can also make new predictions about the structure and organization of language based on insights about the physiology of the brain, by &quot;generalizing from the knowledge of neurological structures to language structure&quot;.

Neurolinguistics research is carried out in all the major areas of linguistics; the main linguistic subfields, and how neurolinguistics addresses them, are given in the table below.

===Topics considered===
Neurolinguistics research investigates several topics, including where language information is processed, how language processing unfolds over time, how brain structures are related to language acquisition and learning, and how neurophysiology can contribute to speech and language pathology.

====Localizations of language processes====
Much work in neurolinguistics has, like Broca&#x27;s and Wernicke&#x27;s early studies, investigated the locations of specific language &quot;modules&quot; within the brain. Research questions include what course language information follows through the brain as it is processed, whether or not particular areas specialize in processing particular sorts of information, how different brain regions interact with one another in language processing, and how the locations of brain activation differ when a subject is producing or perceiving a language other than his or her first language.

====Time course of language processes====
Another area of neurolinguistics literature involves the use of electrophysiological techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time. The temporal ordering of specific patterns of brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing; for example, one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses (the ELAN, N400, and P600) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing.

====Language acquisition====
Another topic is the relationship between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.
Neuroplasticity is observed when both Second Language acquisition and Language Learning experience are induced, the result of this language exposure concludes that an increase of gray and white matter could be found in children, young adults and the elderly.

====Language pathology====
Neurolinguistic techniques are also used to study disorders and breakdowns in language, such as aphasia and dyslexia, and how they relate to physical characteristics of the brain.

==Technology used==

Since one of the focuses of this field is the testing of linguistic and psycholinguistic models, the technology used for experiments is highly relevant to the study of neurolinguistics. Modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions. Brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into hemodynamic methods, electrophysiological methods, and methods that stimulate the cortex directly.

===Hemodynamic===

Hemodynamic techniques take advantage of the fact that when an area of the brain works at a task, blood is sent to supply that area with oxygen (in what is known as the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent, or BOLD, response). Such techniques include PET and fMRI. These techniques provide high &quot;spatial resolution&quot;, allowing researchers to pinpoint the location of activity within the brain; &quot;temporal resolution&quot; (or information about the timing of brain activity), on the other hand, is poor, since the BOLD response happens much more slowly than language processing. In addition to demonstrating which parts of the brain may subserve specific language tasks or computations, hemodynamic methods have also been used to demonstrate how the structure of the brain&#x27;s language architecture and the distribution of language-related activation may change over time, as a function of linguistic exposure.

In addition to PET and fMRI, which show which areas of the brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.

===Electrophysiological===

Electrophysiological techniques take advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons in the brain fire together, they create an electric dipole or current. The technique of EEG measures this electric current using sensors on the scalp, while MEG measures the magnetic fields that are generated by these currents. In addition to these non-invasive methods, electrocorticography has also been used to study language processing. These techniques are able to measure brain activity from one millisecond to the next, providing excellent &quot;temporal resolution&quot;, which is important in studying processes that take place as quickly as language comprehension and production. On the other hand, the location of brain activity can be difficult to identify in EEG; consequently, this technique is used primarily to &quot;how&quot; language processes are carried out, rather than &quot;where&quot;. Research using EEG and MEG generally focuses on event-related potentials (ERPs), which are distinct brain responses (generally realized as negative or positive peaks on a graph of neural activity) elicited in response to a particular stimulus. Studies using ERP may focus on each ERP&#x27;s &quot;latency&quot; (how long after the stimulus the ERP begins or peaks), &quot;amplitude&quot; (how high or low the peak is), or &quot;topography&quot; (where on the scalp the ERP response is picked up by sensors). Some important and common ERP components include the N400 (a negativity occurring at a latency of about 400 milliseconds), the mismatch negativity, the early left anterior negativity (a negativity occurring at an early latency and a front-left topography), the P600, and the lateralized readiness potential.

==Experimental design==

===Experimental techniques===
Neurolinguists employ a variety of experimental techniques in order to use brain imaging to draw conclusions about how language is represented and processed in the brain. These techniques include the &quot;subtraction&quot; paradigm, &quot;mismatch design&quot;, &quot;violation-based&quot; studies, various forms of &quot;priming&quot;, and &quot;direct stimulation&quot; of the brain.

====Subtraction====
Many language studies, particularly in fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve some aspect of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processing—the processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.

====Mismatch paradigm====

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a rigorously documented ERP component frequently used in neurolinguistic experiments. It is an electrophysiological response that occurs in the brain when a subject hears a &quot;deviant&quot; stimulus in a set of perceptually identical &quot;standards&quot; (as in the sequence &quot;s s s s s s s d d s s s s s s d s s s s s d&quot;). Since the MMN is elicited only in response to a rare &quot;oddball&quot; stimulus in a set of other stimuli that are perceived to be the same, it has been used to test how speakers perceive sounds and organize stimuli categorically. For example, a landmark study by Colin Phillips and colleagues used the mismatch negativity as evidence that subjects, when presented with a series of speech sounds with acoustic parameters, perceived all the sounds as either /t/ or /d/ in spite of the acoustic variability, suggesting that the human brain has representations of abstract phonemes—in other words, the subjects were &quot;hearing&quot; not the specific acoustic features, but only the abstract phonemes. In addition, the mismatch negativity has been used to study syntactic processing and the recognition of word category.

====Violation-based====

Many studies in neurolinguistics take advantage of anomalies or &quot;violations&quot; of syntactic or semantic rules in experimental stimuli, and analyzing the brain responses elicited when a subject encounters these violations. For example, sentences beginning with phrases such as *&quot;the garden was on the worked&quot;, which violates an English phrase structure rule, often elicit a brain response called the early left anterior negativity (ELAN). Violation techniques have been in use since at least 1980, when Kutas and Hillyard first reported ERP evidence that semantic violations elicited an N400 effect. Using similar methods, in 1992, Lee Osterhout first reported the P600 response to syntactic anomalies. Violation designs have also been used for hemodynamic studies (fMRI and PET): Embick and colleagues, for example, used grammatical and spelling violations to investigate the location of syntactic processing in the brain using fMRI. Another common use of violation designs is to combine two kinds of violations in the same sentence and thus make predictions about how different language processes interact with one another; this type of crossing-violation study has been used extensively to investigate how syntactic and semantic processes interact while people read or hear sentences.

====Priming====

In psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics, &quot;priming&quot; refers to the phenomenon whereby a subject can recognize a word more quickly if he or she has recently been presented with a word that is similar in meaning or morphological makeup (i.e., composed of similar parts). If a subject is presented with a &quot;prime&quot; word such as &quot;doctor&quot; and then a &quot;target&quot; word such as &quot;nurse&quot;, if the subject has a faster-than-usual response time to &quot;nurse&quot; then the experimenter may assume that word &quot;nurse&quot; in the brain had already been accessed when the word &quot;doctor&quot; was accessed. Priming is used to investigate a wide variety of questions about how words are stored and retrieved in the brain and how structurally complex sentences are processed.

====Stimulation====
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a new noninvasive technique for studying brain activity, uses powerful magnetic fields that are applied to the brain from outside the head. It is a method of exciting or interrupting brain activity in a specific and controlled location, and thus is able to imitate aphasic symptoms while giving the researcher more control over exactly which parts of the brain will be examined. As such, it is a less invasive alternative to direct cortical stimulation, which can be used for similar types of research but requires that the subject&#x27;s scalp be removed, and is thus only used on individuals who are already undergoing a major brain operation (such as individuals undergoing surgery for epilepsy). The logic behind TMS and direct cortical stimulation is similar to the logic behind aphasiology: if a particular language function is impaired when a specific region of the brain is knocked out, then that region must be somehow implicated in that language function. Few neurolinguistic studies to date have used TMS; direct cortical stimulation and cortical recording (recording brain activity using electrodes placed directly on the brain) have been used with macaque monkeys to make predictions about the behavior of human brains.

===Subject tasks===
In many neurolinguistics experiments, subjects do not simply sit and listen to or watch stimuli, but also are instructed to perform some sort of task in response to the stimuli. Subjects perform these tasks while recordings (electrophysiological or hemodynamic) are being taken, usually in order to ensure that they are paying attention to the stimuli. At least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment.

====Lexical decision====

The lexical decision task involves subjects seeing or hearing an isolated word and answering whether or not it is a real word. It is frequently used in priming studies, since subjects are known to make a lexical decision more quickly if a word has been primed by a related word (as in &quot;doctor&quot; priming &quot;nurse&quot;).

====Grammaticality judgment, acceptability judgment====
Many studies, especially violation-based studies, have subjects make a decision about the &quot;acceptability&quot; (usually grammatical acceptability or semantic acceptability) of stimuli. Such a task is often used to &quot;ensure that subjects [are] reading the sentences attentively and that they [distinguish] acceptable from unacceptable sentences in the way the [experimenter] expect[s] them to do.&quot;

Experimental evidence has shown that the instructions given to subjects in an acceptability judgment task can influence the subjects&#x27; brain responses to stimuli. One experiment showed that when subjects were instructed to judge the &quot;acceptability&quot; of sentences they did not show an N400 brain response (a response commonly associated with semantic processing), but that they did show that response when instructed to ignore grammatical acceptability and only judge whether or not the sentences &quot;made sense&quot;.

====Probe verification====
Some studies use a &quot;probe verification&quot; task rather than an overt acceptability judgment; in this paradigm, each experimental sentence is followed by a &quot;probe word&quot;, and subjects must answer whether or not the probe word had appeared in the sentence. This task, like the acceptability judgment task, ensures that subjects are reading or listening attentively, but may avoid some of the additional processing demands of acceptability judgments, and may be used no matter what type of violation is being presented in the study.

====Truth-value judgment====
Subjects may be instructed not to judge whether or not the sentence is grammatically acceptable or logical, but whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false. This task is commonly used in psycholinguistic studies of child language.

====Active distraction and double-task====
Some experiments give subjects a &quot;distractor&quot; task to ensure that subjects are not consciously paying attention to the experimental stimuli; this may be done to test whether a certain computation in the brain is carried out automatically, regardless of whether the subject devotes attentional resources to it. For example, one study had subjects listen to non-linguistic tones (long beeps and buzzes) in one ear and speech in the other ear, and instructed subjects to press a button when they perceived a change in the tone; this supposedly caused subjects not to pay explicit attention to grammatical violations in the speech stimuli. The subjects showed a mismatch response (MMN) anyway, suggesting that the processing of the grammatical errors was happening automatically, regardless of attention—or at least that subjects were unable to consciously separate their attention from the speech stimuli.

Another related form of experiment is the double-task experiment, in which a subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind of experiment has been used to investigate the use of working memory in language processing.

<text>Aphasiology is the study of language impairment usually resulting from brain damage, due to neurovascular accident—hemorrhage, stroke—or associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including different types of dementia. These specific language deficits, termed aphasias, may be defined as impairments of language production or comprehension that cannot be attributed to trivial causes such as deafness or oral paralysis. A number of aphasias have been described, but two are best known: expressive aphasia (Broca&#x27;s aphasia) and receptive aphasia (Wernicke&#x27;s or sensory aphasia).

==Acute aphasias==
Acute aphasias are often the result of tissue damage following a stroke.

===Expressive aphasia===

First described by the French neurologist Paul Broca in the nineteenth century, expressive aphasia causes the speech of those affected to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits. It is characterized by a halting speech consisting mainly of content words, i.e. nouns and verbs, and, at least in English, distinctly lacking small grammatical function words such as articles and prepositions. This observation gave rise to the terms telegraphic speech and, more recently, agrammatism. The extent to which expressive aphasics retain knowledge of grammar is a matter of considerable controversy. Nonetheless, because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved, and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across, the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences.

The view of expressive aphasia as an expressive disorder is supported by its frequent co-occurrence with facial motor difficulties, and its anatomical localization. Although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions, it is most commonly associated with the inferior frontal gyrus, a region that overlaps with motor cortex controlling the mouth and tongue, extending into the periventricular white matter. Not surprisingly, this region has come to be known as &quot;Broca&#x27;s area&quot;. However, an intriguing line of research has demonstrated specific comprehension deficits in expressive aphasics as well. These deficits generally involve sentences that are grammatical, but atypical in their word order. The simplest example is sentences in the passive voice, such as &quot;The boy was chased by the girl.&quot; Expressive aphasics may have quite a hard time realizing that the girl is doing the chasing, but they do much better with &quot;The mouse was chased by the cat,&quot; where world knowledge constraints contribute to the correct interpretation. However, &quot;The cat was chased by the mouse&quot; would likewise be incomprehensible. This evidence suggests that grammatical competence may be a specific function of Broca&#x27;s area.

Lesions exclusive to Broca&#x27;s area (the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus) do not produce Broca&#x27;s aphasia but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia, sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria. Not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce Broca&#x27;s aphasia, but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-Rolandic motor strip (the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control) is also necessary.

===Receptive aphasia===

Receptive aphasia was originally described by the German neurologist Karl Wernicke, a contemporary of Broca. Receptive aphasics produce speech that seems fluent and grammatical, but is largely devoid of sensible content. Comprehension is severely impaired, but while patients display a great deal of difficulty comprehending individual words, they can more easily understand words in context. Receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus in the distribution of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery, known as &quot;Wernicke&#x27;s area&quot;, an area adjacent to the cortex responsible for auditory processing. If the damage extends posteriorly, visual connections are disrupted, and the patient will have difficulty understanding written language. Therefore, the localization of the two best-known aphasias mirrors the grossest dichotomy in brain organization: anterior areas are specialized for motor output, and posterior areas for sensory processing.

A fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to Expressive and Receptive aphasias in hearing populations. These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca&#x27;s area and the semantic functions of Wernicke&#x27;s area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.

===Global aphasia===

Another less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia, which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs, including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both Broca&#x27;s area and Wernicke&#x27;s area. Survivors with global aphasia may have great difficulty understanding and forming words and sentences, and generally experience a great deal of difficulty when trying to communicate. With considerable speech therapy rehabilitation, global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia.

===Anomic aphasia===

A person with anomic aphasia have word-finding difficulties. Anomic aphasia, also known as anomia, is a non-fluent aphasia, which means the person speaks hesitantly because of a difficulty naming words or producing correct syntax. The person struggles to find the right words for speaking and writing. Subjects tend to use circumlocutions, in which they speak around the word they can not find, to make up for their loss. People also with anomic aphasia tend to know how to use an object, but rather can not name the aforementioned object. Any damage in or near the zone of language can result in anomic aphasia. Other forms of aphasia often transition into a syndrome of primarily anomic aphasia in the process of recovery.

===Conduction aphasia===

Conduction Aphasia is a rare form of aphasia in which fibres in the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus are damaged. These fibres are the link between the Wernicke&#x27;s and Broca&#x27;s area. Damage to the area connecting comprehension and expression together has the following symptoms: fluent speech, good comprehension, poor oral reading, repetition is poor and transpositions of sounds within words is very common.

==Primary progressive aphasias==

Primary progressive aphasia is a rare disorder where people slowly lose their ability to talk, read, write, and comprehend what they hear in conversation over a period of time. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by Mesulam in 1982. There are three variants: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA).

==History==

The nineteenth century marked the most important time in the evolution of aphasiology, beginning with the works of Franz Josef Gall. Gall is the founder of the more modern localization theory and is the origin of the idea of a language center in the brain. However, supporting evidence for the theory that language had its own anatomical representation was not found until the case study of Mr. Leborgne, also known as Tan, by Paul Broca in 1861. The discovery of what is now known as Broca&#x27;s area was followed years later by Carl Wernicke&#x27;s famous work, &#x27;The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis&#x27; in 1874. This paper is regarded as one of the most influential works in the history of the field of aphasiology. In it, Wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia.

<text>Spent mushroom compost is the residual compost waste generated by the mushroom production industry.

==Background==
It is readily available (bagged, at nursery suppliers), and its formulation generally consists of a combination of wheat straw, dried blood, horse manure and ground chalk, composted together. It is an excellent source of humus, although much of its nitrogen content will have been used up by the composting and growing mushrooms. It remains, however, a good source of general nutrients (1-2% N, 0.2% P, 1.3% K plus a full range of trace elements), as well as a useful soil conditioner. However, due to its chalk content, it may be alkaline, and should not be used on acid-loving plants, nor should it be applied too frequently, as it will overly raise the soil&#x27;s pH levels.

Mushroom compost may also contain pesticide residues, particularly organochlorides used against the fungus gnat. If the compost pile was stored outside, it may contain grubs or other insects attracted to decaying matter. Chemicals may also have been used to treat the straw, and also to sterilize the compost. Therefore, the organic gardener must be careful regarding the sourcing of mushroom compost; if in doubt, samples can be analyzed for contamination – in the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is able to advise regarding this issue.

Commercially available &#x27;spent&#x27; mushroom compost is not always truly spent. It is sold by mushroom farms when it is no longer producing commercially viable yields of mushrooms. It can be used to grow further smaller crops of mushrooms before final use on the garden.

<doc id="179095" wikidata="Q179266" url="?curid=179095" title="Jiddu Krishnamurti">
<text>Jiddu Krishnamurti ( ; 11 May 1895 – 17 February 1986) was an Indian philosopher, speaker, writer, and spiritual figure. Adopted by members of the Theosophical tradition as a child, he was raised to fill the advanced role of World Teacher, but in adulthood he rejected this mantle and distanced himself from the related religious movement. He spent the rest of his life speaking to groups and individuals around the world; many of these talks have been published. He also wrote many books, among them &quot;The First and Last Freedom&quot; (1954) and &quot;Commentaries on Living&quot; (1956–60). His last public talk was in January 1986, a month before his death at his home in Ojai, California.

Krishnamurti asserted that &quot;truth is a pathless land&quot; and advised against following any doctrine, discipline, teacher, guru, or authority, including himself. He emphasized topics such as choiceless awareness, psychological inquiry, and freedom from religious, spiritual, and cultural conditioning. His supporters — working through non-profit foundations in India, Britain, and the United States — oversee several independent schools based on his views on education, and continue to distribute his thousands of talks, group and individual discussions, and writings in a variety of media formats and languages.

==Biography==
===Family background and childhood===
The date of birth of Krishnamurti is a matter of dispute. Mary Lutyens determines it to be 11 May 1895, but Christine Williams notes the unreliability of birth registrations in that period and that statements claiming dates ranging from 4 May 1895 to 25 May 1896 exist. She used calculations based on a published horoscope to derive a date of 11 May 1895 but &quot;retains a measure of scepticism&quot; about it.

His birthplace was the small town of Madanapalle in Madras Presidency ( Chittoor District in Andhra Pradesh). He was born in a Telugu-speaking Brahmin family. His father, Jiddu Narayanaiah, was employed as an official of the British colonial administration. Krishnamurti was fond of his mother Sanjeevamma, who died when he was ten. His parents had a total of eleven children, of whom six survived childhood.

In 1903 the family settled in Kadapa, where Krishnamurti had contracted malaria during a previous stay. He suffered recurrent bouts of the disease over many years. A sensitive and sickly child, &quot;vague and dreamy&quot;, he was often taken to be intellectually disabled, and was beaten regularly at school by his teachers and at home by his father. In memoirs written when he was eighteen years old Krishnamurti described psychic experiences, such as seeing his sister, who had died in 1904, and his late mother. Even from his childhood he felt a bond with nature which was to stay with him for the rest of his life. Writing in his journal Krishnamurti states &quot;He always had this strange lack of distance between himself and the trees, rivers, mountains. It wasn&#x27;t cultivated.&quot;

Krishnamurti&#x27;s father retired at the end of 1907. He sought employment at the headquarters of the Theosophical Society at Adyar. Narayanaiah had been a Theosophist since 1882. He was eventually hired by the Society as a clerk, moving there with his family in January 1909. Narayanaiah and his sons were at first assigned to live in a small cottage that was located just outside the society&#x27;s compound.

Krishnamurti was a vegetarian from birth and his family were strict vegetarians. He was an opponent of meat eating, based on ethical and spiritual reasons. Krishnamurti was also a &quot;teetotaler, nonsmoker and practitioner of yoga.&quot;

===Discovered===
In April 1909, Krishnamurti first met Charles Webster Leadbeater, who claimed clairvoyance. Leadbeater had noticed Krishnamurti on the Society&#x27;s beach on the Adyar river, and was amazed by the &quot;most wonderful aura he had ever seen, without a particle of selfishness in it.&quot; Ernest Wood, an adjutant of Leadbeater&#x27;s at the time, who helped Krishnamurti with his homework, considered him to be &quot;particularly dim-witted.&quot; Leadbeater was convinced that the boy would become a spiritual teacher and a great orator; the likely &quot;vehicle for the Lord Maitreya&quot; in Theosophical doctrine, an advanced spiritual entity periodically appearing on Earth as a World Teacher to guide the evolution of humankind.

In her biography of Krishnamurti, Pupul Jayakar quotes him speaking of that period in his life some 75 years later: &quot;The boy had always said &#x27;I will do whatever you want.&#x27; There was an element of subservience, obedience. The boy was vague, uncertain, ; he didn&#x27;t seem to care what was happening. He was like a vessel with a large hole in it, whatever was put in, went through, nothing remained.&quot; Krishnamurti himself described his state of mind as a young boy: &quot;No thought entered his mind. He was watching and listening and nothing else. Thought with its associations never arose. There was no image-making. He often attempted to think but no thought would come.&quot;

Following his discovery by Leadbeater, Krishnamurti was nurtured by the Theosophical Society in Adyar. Leadbeater and a small number of trusted associates undertook the task of educating, protecting, and generally preparing Krishnamurti as the &quot;vehicle&quot; of the expected World Teacher. Krishnamurti (often later called &quot;Krishnaji&quot;) and his younger brother Nityananda (&quot;Nitya&quot;) were privately tutored at the Theosophical compound in Madras, and later exposed to an opulent life among a segment of European high society as they continued their education abroad. Despite his history of problems with schoolwork and concerns about his capacities and physical condition, the 14-year-old Krishnamurti was able to speak and write competently in English within six months. Lutyens says that later in life Krishnamurti came to view his &quot;discovery&quot; as a life-saving event. When he was asked in later life what he thought would have happened to him if he had not been &#x27;discovered&#x27; by Leadbeater he unhesitatingly replied &quot;I would have died&quot;.

During this time Krishnamurti had developed a strong bond with Annie Besant and came to view her as a surrogate mother. His father, who had initially assented to Besant&#x27;s legal guardianship of Krishnamurti, was pushed into the background by the swirl of attention around his son. In 1912 he sued Besant to annul the guardianship agreement. After a protracted legal battle, Besant took custody of Krishnamurti and Nitya. As a result of this separation from family and home Krishnamurti and his brother (whose relationship had always been very close) became more dependent on each other, and in the following years often travelled together.

In 1911 the Theosophical Society established the Order of the Star in the East (OSE) to prepare the world for the expected appearance of the World Teacher. Krishnamurti was named as its head, with senior Theosophists assigned various other positions. Membership was open to anybody who accepted the doctrine of the &quot;Coming of the World Teacher&quot;. Controversy soon erupted, both within the Theosophical Society and outside it, in Hindu circles and the Indian press.

===Growing up===
Mary Lutyens, a biographer, says that there was a time when Krishnamurti believed that he was to become the World Teacher after correct spiritual and secular guidance and education. Another biographer describes the daily program imposed on him by Leadbeater and his associates, which included rigorous exercise and sports, tutoring in a variety of school subjects, Theosophical and religious lessons, yoga and meditation, as well as instruction in proper hygiene and in the ways of British society and culture. At the same time Leadbeater assumed the role of guide in a parallel mystical instruction of Krishnamurti; the existence and progress of this instruction was at the time known only to a select few.

While he showed a natural aptitude in sports, Krishnamurti always had problems with formal schooling and was not academically inclined. He eventually gave up university education after several attempts at admission. He did take to foreign languages, in time speaking several with some fluency.

His public image, cultivated by the Theosophists, &quot;was to be characterized by a well-polished exterior, a sobriety of purpose, a cosmopolitan outlook and an otherworldly, almost detachment in his demeanor.&quot; Demonstrably, &quot;all of these can be said to have characterized Krishnamurti&#x27;s public image to the end of his life.&quot; It was apparently clear early on that he &quot;possessed an innate personal magnetism, not of a warm physical variety, but nonetheless emotive in its austerity, and inclined to inspire veneration.&quot; However, as he was growing up, Krishnamurti showed signs of adolescent rebellion and emotional instability, chafing at the regimen imposed on him, visibly uncomfortable with the publicity surrounding him, and occasionally expressing doubts about the future prescribed for him.
Krishnamurti and Nitya were taken to England in April 1911. During this trip Krishnamurti gave his first public speech to members of the OSE in London. His first writings had also started to appear, published in booklets by the Theosophical Society and in Theosophical and OSE-affiliated magazines. Between 1911 and the start of World War I in 1914, the brothers visited several other European countries, always accompanied by Theosophist chaperones. Meanwhile, Krishnamurti had for the first time acquired a measure of personal financial independence, thanks to a wealthy benefactress, American Mary Melissa Hoadley Dodge, who was domiciled in England.

After the war, Krishnamurti embarked on a series of lectures, meetings and discussions around the world, related to his duties as the Head of the OSE, accompanied by Nitya, by then the Organizing Secretary of the Order. Krishnamurti also continued writing. The content of his talks and writings revolved around the work of the Order and of its members in preparation for the &quot;Coming&quot;. He was initially described as a halting, hesitant, and repetitive speaker, but his delivery and confidence improved, and he gradually took command of the meetings.

In 1921 Krishnamurti fell in love with Helen Knothe, a 17-year-old American whose family associated with the Theosophists. The experience was tempered by the realisation that his work and expected life-mission precluded what would otherwise be considered normal relationships and by the mid-1920s the two of them had drifted apart.

===Life-altering experiences===
In 1922 Krishnamurti and Nitya travelled from Sydney to California. In California, they stayed at a cottage in the Ojai Valley. It was thought that the area&#x27;s climate would be beneficial to Nitya, who had been diagnosed with tuberculosis. Nitya&#x27;s failing health became a concern for Krishnamurti. At Ojai they met Rosalind Williams, a young American who became close to them both, and who was later to play a significant role in Krishnamurti&#x27;s life. For the first time the brothers were without immediate supervision by their Theosophical Society minders. They found the Valley to be very agreeable. Eventually, a trust, formed by supporters, bought a cottage and surrounding property there for them. This became Krishnamurti&#x27;s official residence.

At Ojai in August and September 1922, Krishnamurti went through an intense &#x27;life-changing&#x27; experience. This has been variously characterised as a spiritual awakening, a psychological transformation, and a physical reconditioning. The initial events happened in two distinct phases: first a three-day spiritual experience, and two weeks later, a longer-lasting condition that Krishnamurti and those around him referred to as &quot;the process&quot;. This condition recurred, at frequent intervals and with varying intensity, until his death.

According to witnesses, it started on 17 August 1922 when Krishnamurti complained of a sharp pain at the nape of his neck. Over the next two days the symptoms worsened, with increasing pain and sensitivity, loss of appetite, and occasional delirious ramblings. He seemed to lapse into unconsciousness but later recounted that he was very much aware of his surroundings, and that while in that state he had an experience of &quot;mystical union&quot;. The following day the symptoms and the experience intensified, climaxing with a sense of &quot;immense peace&quot;. Following — and apparently related to — these events the condition that came to be known as &quot;the process&quot; started to affect him, in September and October that year, as a regular, almost nightly occurrence. Later the &quot;process&quot; resumed intermittently, with varying degrees of pain, physical discomfort, and sensitivity, occasionally a lapse into a childlike state, and sometimes an apparent fading out of consciousness, explained as either his body giving in to pain or his mind &quot;going off&quot;.

These experiences were accompanied or followed by what was interchangeably described as, &quot;the benediction&quot;, &quot;the immensity&quot;, &quot;the sacredness&quot;, &quot;the vastness&quot; and, most often, &quot;the otherness&quot; or &quot;the other&quot;. It was a state distinct from the process. According to Lutyens it is evident from his notebook that this experience of &quot;otherness&quot; was &quot;with him almost continuously&quot; during his life, and gave him &quot;a sense of being protected&quot;. Krishnamurti describes it in his notebook as typically following an acute experience of the &quot;process&quot;, for example, on awakening the next day:
This experience of the &quot;otherness&quot; was present with him in daily events:
Since the initial occurrences of 1922, several explanations have been proposed for this experience of Krishnamurti&#x27;s. Leadbeater and other Theosophists expected the &quot;vehicle&quot; to have certain paranormal experiences but were nevertheless mystified by these developments. During Krishnamurti&#x27;s later years, the nature and provenance of the continuing &quot;process&quot; often came up as a subject in private discussions between himself and associates; these discussions shed some light on the subject but were ultimately inconclusive. Whatever the case, the &quot;process&quot;, and the inability of Leadbeater to explain it satisfactorily, if at all, had other consequences according to biographer Roland Vernon:

As news of these mystical experiences spread, rumours concerning the messianic status of Krishnamurti reached fever pitch as the 1925 Theosophical Society Convention was planned, on the 50th anniversary of its founding. There were expectations of significant happenings. Paralleling the increasing adulation was Krishnamurti&#x27;s growing discomfort with it. In related developments, prominent Theosophists and their factions within the Society were trying to position themselves favourably relative to the &quot;Coming&quot;, which was widely rumoured to be approaching. He stated that &quot;Too much of everything is bad&quot;. &quot;Extraordinary&quot; pronouncements of spiritual advancement were made by various parties, disputed by others, and the internal Theosophical politics further alienated Krishnamurti.

Nitya&#x27;s persistent health problems had periodically resurfaced throughout this time. On 13 November 1925, at age 27, he died in Ojai from complications of influenza and tuberculosis. Despite Nitya&#x27;s poor health, his death was unexpected, and it fundamentally shook Krishnamurti&#x27;s belief in Theosophy and in the leaders of the Theosophical Society. He had received their assurances regarding Nitya&#x27;s health, and had come to believe that &quot;Nitya was essential for [his] life-mission and therefore he would not be allowed to die,&quot; a belief shared by Annie Besant and Krishnamurti&#x27;s circle. Jayakar wrote that &quot;his belief in the Masters and the hierarchy had undergone a total revolution.&quot; Moreover, Nitya had been the &quot;last surviving link to his family and childhood. ... The only person to whom he could talk openly, his best friend and companion.&quot; According to eyewitness accounts, the news &quot;broke him completely.&quot; but 12 days after Nitya&#x27;s death he was &quot;immensely quiet, radiant, and free of all sentiment and emotion&quot;; &quot;there was not a shadow ... to show what he had been through.&quot;

===Break with the past===
Over the next few years, Krishnamurti&#x27;s new vision and consciousness continued to develop. New concepts appeared in his talks, discussions, and correspondence, together with an evolving vocabulary that was progressively free of Theosophical terminology. His new direction reached a climax in 1929, when he rebuffed attempts by Leadbeater and Besant to continue with the Order of the Star.

Krishnamurti dissolved the Order during the annual Star Camp at Ommen, the Netherlands, on 3 August 1929. He stated that he had made his decision after &quot;careful consideration&quot; during the previous two years, and that:


Following the dissolution, prominent Theosophists turned against Krishnamurti, including Leadbeater who is said to have stated, &quot;the Coming had gone wrong.&quot; Krishnamurti had denounced all organised belief, the notion of gurus, and the whole teacher-follower relationship, vowing instead to work on setting people &quot;absolutely, unconditionally free.&quot; There is no record of his explicitly denying he was the World Teacher; whenever he was asked to clarify his position he either asserted that the matter was irrelevant or gave answers that, as he stated, were &quot;purposely vague&quot;.

In hind-sight it can be seen that the ongoing changes in his outlook had begun before the dissolution of the Order of the Star. The subtlety of the new distinctions on the World Teacher issue was lost on many of his admirers, who were already bewildered or distraught because of the changes in Krishnamurti&#x27;s outlook, vocabulary and pronouncements–among them Besant and Mary Lutyens&#x27; mother Emily, who had a very close relationship with him. He soon disassociated himself from the Theosophical Society and its teachings and practices, yet he remained on cordial terms with some of its members and ex-members throughout his life.

Krishnamurti often referred to the totality of his work as &quot;the&quot; teachings and not as &quot;my&quot; teachings.

Krishnamurti resigned from the various trusts and other organisations that were affiliated with the defunct Order of the Star, including the Theosophical Society. He returned the money and properties donated to the Order, among them a castle in the Netherlands and of land, to their donors.

===Middle years===
From 1930 through 1944 Krishnamurti engaged in speaking tours and in the issue of publications under the auspice of the &quot;Star Publishing Trust&quot; (SPT), which he had founded with Desikacharya Rajagopal, a close associate and friend from the &quot;Order of the Star&quot;. Ojai was the base of operations for the new enterprise, where Krishnamurti, Rajagopal, and Rosalind Williams (who had married Rajagopal in 1927) resided in the house known as &quot;Arya Vihara&quot; (meaning &quot;Realm of the Aryas&quot;, i.e. those noble by righteousness in Sanskrit). The business and organizational aspects of the SPT were administered chiefly by D. Rajagopal, as Krishnamurti devoted his time to speaking and meditation. The Rajagopals&#x27; marriage was not a happy one, and the two became physically estranged after the 1931 birth of their daughter, Radha. Krishnamurti&#x27;s friendship with Rosalind became a love affair. According to Radha Rajagopal Sloss, the affair between Krishnamurti and Rosalind began in 1932 and it endured for about twenty-five years. Radha Sloss, daughter of Rajagopal, wrote about the affair in her book &quot;Lives in the Shadow with J. Krishnamurti&quot;.

During the 1930s Krishnamurti spoke in Europe, Latin America, India, Australia and the United States. George Bernard Shaw in his later years was acquainted with Krishnamurti and declared Krishnamurti to be the &quot;most beautiful human being&quot; he had ever met. In 1938 he met Aldous Huxley. The two began a close friendship which endured for many years. They held common concerns about the imminent conflict in Europe which they viewed as the outcome of the pernicious influence of nationalism. Krishnamurti&#x27;s stance on World War II was often construed as pacifism and even subversion during a time of patriotic fervor in the United States and for a time he came under the surveillance of the FBI. He did not speak publicly for a period of about four years (between 1940 and 1944). During this time he lived and worked at &quot;Arya Vihara&quot;, which during the war operated as a largely self-sustaining farm, with its surplus goods donated for relief efforts in Europe. Of the years spent in Ojai during the war he later said: &quot;I think it was a period of no challenge, no demand, no outgoing. I think it was a kind of everything held in; and when I left Ojai it all burst.&quot;

Krishnamurti broke the hiatus from public speaking in May 1944 with a series of talks in Ojai. These talks, and subsequent material, were published by &quot;&quot;Krishnamurti Writings Inc.&quot; (KWINC), the successor organisation to the &quot;Star Publishing Trust&quot;.&quot; This was to be the new central Krishnamurti-related entity worldwide, whose sole purpose was the dissemination of the teaching. He had remained in contact with associates from India, and in the autumn of 1947 embarked on a speaking tour there, attracting a new following of young intellectuals. On this trip he encountered the Mehta sisters, Pupul and Nandini, who became lifelong associates and confidants. The sisters also attended to Krishnamurti throughout a 1948 recurrence of the &quot;process&quot; in Ootacamund. In Poona in 1948, Krishnamurti met Iyengar, who taught him Yoga practices every morning for the next three months, then on and off for twenty years.

When Krishnamurti was in India after World War II many prominent personalities came to meet him, including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. In his meetings with Nehru, Krishnamurti elaborated at length on the teachings, saying in one instance, &quot;Understanding of the self only arises in relationship, in watching yourself in relationship to people, ideas, and things; to trees, the earth, and the world around you and within you. Relationship is the mirror in which the self is revealed. Without self-knowledge there is no basis for right thought and action.&quot; Nehru asked, &quot;How does one start?&quot; to which Krishnamurti replied, &quot;Begin where you are. Read every word, every phrase, every paragraph of the mind, as it operates through thought.&quot;

===Later years===
Krishnamurti continued speaking in public lectures, group discussions and with concerned individuals around the world. He met with many prominent religious leaders and scholars including Swami Venkatesananda, Anandamayi Ma, Lakshman Joo, Walpola Rahula, and Eugene Schalert. In India he also met with many sanyasis and monks throughout his life. In the early 1960s, he made the acquaintance of physicist David Bohm, whose philosophical and scientific concerns regarding the essence of the physical world, and the psychological and sociological state of mankind, found parallels in Krishnamurti&#x27;s philosophy. The two men soon became close friends and started a common inquiry, in the form of personal dialogues–and occasionally in group discussions with other participants–that continued, periodically, over nearly two decades. Several of these discussions were published in the form of books or as parts of books, and introduced a wider audience (among scientists) to Krishnamurti&#x27;s ideas. Although Krishnamurti&#x27;s philosophy delved into fields as diverse as religious studies, education, psychology, physics, and consciousness studies, he was not then, nor since, well known in academic circles. Nevertheless, Krishnamurti met and held discussions with physicists Fritjof Capra and E. C. George Sudarshan, biologist Rupert Sheldrake, psychiatrist David Shainberg, as well as psychotherapists representing various theoretical orientations. The long friendship with Bohm went through a rocky interval in later years, and although they overcame their differences and remained friends until Krishnamurti&#x27;s death, the relationship did not regain its previous intensity.

In the 1970s, Krishnamurti met several times with then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi, with whom he had far-ranging, and in some cases, very serious conversations. Jayakar considers his message in meetings with Indira Gandhi as a possible influence in the lifting of certain emergency measures Gandhi had imposed during periods of political turmoil.

Meanwhile, Krishnamurti&#x27;s once close relationship with the Rajagopals had deteriorated to the point where he took D. Rajagopal to court to recover donated property and funds as well as publication rights for his works, manuscripts, and personal correspondence, that were in Rajagopal&#x27;s possession. The litigation and ensuing cross complaints, which formally began in 1971, continued for many years. Much property and materials were returned to Krishnamurti during his lifetime; the parties to this case finally settled all other matters in 1986, shortly after his death.

In 1984 and 1985, Krishnamurti spoke to an invited audience at the United Nations in New York, under the auspices of the Pacem in Terris Society chapter at the United Nations. In October 1985, he visited India for the last time, holding a number of what came to be known as &quot;farewell&quot; talks and discussions between then and January 1986. These last talks included the fundamental questions he had been asking through the years, as well as newer concerns about advances in science and technology, and their effect on humankind. Krishnamurti had commented to friends that he did not wish to invite death, but was not sure how long his body would last (he had already lost considerable weight), and once he could no longer talk, he would have &quot;no further purpose&quot;. In his final talk, on 4 January 1986, in Madras, he again invited the audience to examine with him the nature of inquiry, the effect of technology, the nature of life and meditation, and the nature of creation.

Krishnamurti was also concerned about his legacy, about being unwittingly turned into some personage whose teachings had been handed down to special individuals, rather than the world at large. He did not want anybody to pose as an interpreter of the teaching. He warned his associates on several occasions that they were not to present themselves as spokesmen on his behalf, or as his successors after his death.

A few days before his death, in a final statement, he declared that nobody among either his associates or the general public had understood what had happened to him (as the conduit of the teaching). He added that the &quot;supreme intelligence&quot; operating in his body would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, he stated that people could perhaps get into touch with that somewhat &quot;if they live the teachings&quot;. In prior discussions, he had compared himself with Thomas Edison, implying that he did the hard work, and now all that was needed by others was a flick of the switch.

==Death==
Krishnamurti died of pancreatic cancer on 17 February 1986, at the age of 90. The announcement of KFT (Krishnamurti Foundation Trust) refers to the course of his health condition until the moment of death. The first signs came almost nine months before his death, when he felt very tired. In October 1985, he went from Bramdean, England (Brockwood Park School) to India and after that, he suffered from exhaustion, fevers, and lost weight. Krishnamurti decided to go back to Ojai (10 January 1986) after his last talks in Madras, which necessitated a 24-hour flight. Once he arrived at Ojai he underwent medical tests that revealed he was suffering from pancreatic cancer. The cancer was untreatable, either surgically or otherwise, so Krishnamurti decided to go back to his home at Ojai, where he spent his last days. Friends and professionals nursed him. His mind was clear until the last moment. Krishnamurti died on 17 February 1986, at 10 minutes past midnight, California time. In accordance with his wishes, no memorial service was conducted. His ashes were divided into three parts: for Ojai, India and England. In India they were immersed in River Ganga in Varanasi, Gangotri, and in the ocean Adayar beach.

==Schools==

Krishnamurti founded five schools in India, the oldest being Rishi Valley School that he founded in 1928 in Andhra Pradesh, ten miles from Madanapalle, his birth place. He also founded one in England, Brockwood Park School in 1969, and one in California, Oak Grove School. When asked, he enumerated the following as his educational aims:
#&quot;Global outlook&quot;: A vision of the whole as distinct from the part; there should never be a sectarian outlook, but always a holistic outlook free from all prejudice.
#&quot;Concern for man and the environment&quot;: Humanity is part of nature, and if nature is not cared for, it will boomerang on man. Only the right education, and deep affection between people everywhere, will resolve many problems including the environmental challenges.
#&quot;Religious spirit, which includes the scientific temper&quot;: The religious mind is alone, not lonely. It is in communion with people and nature.

The Krishnamurti Foundations, established in India, USA, and England in the 1960&#x27;s manage seven schools in India and abroad.

==Influence==
Krishnamurti attracted the interest of the mainstream religious establishment in India. He engaged in discussions with several well known Hindu and Buddhist scholars and leaders, including the Dalai Lama. Several of these discussions were later published as chapters in various Krishnamurti books.

Krishnamurti was very highly regarded by several leading religious figures in India. Nisargadatta Maharaj described Krishnamurti as &#x27;complete Brahman&#x27;. Anandamayi Ma addressed him as the &#x27;Guru of gurus&#x27;. When Ramana Maharshi was asked why Krishnamurti dissolved the Order of the Star in the East, he replied &quot;The Order&#x27;s purpose stood consummated in that the World Teacher had arrived; that is why it was dissolved.&quot;

Notable individuals influenced by Krishnamurti include George Bernard Shaw, David Bohm, Jawaharlal Nehru, the Dalai Lama, Aldous Huxley, Alan Watts, Henry Miller, Bruce Lee, Terence Stamp, Jackson Pollock, Toni Packer, Achyut Patwardhan, Dada Dharmadhikari, Derek Trucks, U.G. Krishnamurti and Eckhart Tolle.

Interest in Krishnamurti and his work has persisted in the years since his death. Many books, audio, video, and computer materials, remain in print and are carried by major online and traditional retailers. The four official Foundations continue to maintain archives, disseminate the teachings in an increasing number of languages, convert print to digital and other media, develop websites, sponsor television programs, and organise meetings and dialogues of interested persons around the world.

== In popular culture ==
A sample of Krishnamurti&#x27;s 1980 talk &quot;Why Does The Mind Constantly Seek Pleasure&quot; appears in the Tube &amp; Berger song Imprint of Pleasure.

Krishnamurti is one of the people who Indiana Jones meets in &quot;The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;. Krishnamurti is shown as a young boy around 10-12 years old, this is around the time that he was first associated with the Theosophical Society. He meets and becomes friends with Indy in Season 2 episode 15 titled &quot;Benares, January 1910&quot; (later re-edited into the episode &quot;Journey of Radiance&quot;). Indy, his parents and his tutor Miss Seymour attend a meeting of the society.

Krishnamurti appears as an important character in James Harpur&#x27;s 2021 novel, &quot;The Pathless Country&quot;.

<text>Isaak August Dorner (20 June 1809 – 8 July 1884) was a German Lutheran church leader. He served as a professor of theology at various institutions, including Tübingen, Kiel, Königsberg, Bonn, Göttingen, and Berlin. He was a meditating theologian and had an international influence. His primary work has been translated into English.

==Life==
He was born at Neuhausen ob Eck in Württemberg, where his father was pastor in the Lutheran Church. He was educated at Maulbronn and the University of Tübingen. After assisting his father for two years, he travelled in England and the Netherlands to complete his studies and acquaint himself with different types of Protestantism. He returned to Tübingen in 1834, and in 1837 was appointed professor extraordinarius of theology. As a student at the university, one of his teachers had been Christian Friedrich Schmid, author of the well-known &quot;Biblische Theologie des Neuen Testamentes&quot; and one of the most vigorous opponents of F. C. Baur. Dorner, in collaboration with Schmid, initiated a significant opposition to the Tübingen School, which was at the height of its activity and influence during that period.

Dorner first gained recognition for his extensive study of the history of Christology, which explores the evolution of Christology from the end of the apostolic age to contemporary times. Initially published in the &quot;Theological Quarterly Review&quot; of Tübingen, it was later released as an expanded standalone volume.
At Schmid&#x27;s suggestion, and with his encouragement, Dorner set to work on the history of the development of the doctrine of the person of Christ, &quot;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Lehre von der Person Christi&quot;. He published the first part of it in 1835, the year in which David Strauss, his colleague, published his &quot;Life of Jesus&quot;; completed it in 1839, and afterwards considerably enlarged it for a second edition (1845–1856). It was an indirect reply to Strauss, which showed, &quot;profound learning, objectivity of judgment, and fine appreciation of the moving ideas of history&quot; (Otto Pfleiderer). Dorner undertook a comprehensive revision of this work, resulting in a substantial increase in length, more than doubling the original content. 

Dorner at once became highly regarded as a theologian and historian and in 1839 was invited to Kiel as professor ordinarius. It was there that he produced &quot;Das Princip unserer Kirche nach dem innern Verhältniss seiner zwei Seiten betrachtet&quot; (1841). In 1843 he moved as professor of theology to Königsberg. From there he was called to Bonn in 1847, and to Göttingen in 1853. Finally in 1862 he settled as a professor at Berlin, where he was a member of the supreme consistorial council of the Evangelical State Church in Prussia. A few years later (1867) he published his valuable &quot;Geschichte der protestantischen Theologie&quot; (English translation, &quot;History of Protestant Theology&quot;, 2 volumes; 1871), in which he &quot;developed and elaborated,&quot; as Pfleiderer says, &quot;his own convictions by his diligent and loving study of the history of the Church’s thought and belief.&quot;

The theological positions to which he ultimately attained are best seen in his &quot;Christliche Glaubenslehre&quot;, published shortly before his death (1879–1881). It is &quot;a work extremely rich in thought and matter. It takes the reader through a mass of historical material by the examination and discussion of ancient and modern teachers, and so leads up to the author&#x27;s own view, which is mostly one intermediate between the opposite extremes, and appears as a more or less successful synthesis of antagonistic theses&quot; (Pfleiderer). The companion work, &quot;System der christlichen Sittenlehre&quot;, was published by his son August Dorner in 1886. He also contributed articles to Herzog-Hauck&#x27;s &quot;Realencyklopädie&quot;, and was the founder and for many years one of the editors of the &quot;Jahrbücher fur deutsche Theologie&quot;.

In the context of the 1848 Revolution, Dorner authored a significant essay addressing the critical issue of the separation of church and state. This publication positioned him as an important figure in the early development of &quot;the German Evangelical Church Day&quot; (&quot;Deutschen Evangelischen Kirchentags)&quot;, highlighting his influence on the ecclesiastical and socio-political discourse of the era.

Dorner died at Wiesbaden on 8 July 1884. One of the most noteworthy of the &quot;mediating&quot; theologians, he has been ranked with Friedrich Schleiermacher, August Neander, Karl Nitzsch, Julius Müller and Richard Rothe.

His son, August Dorner, also became a prominent theologian.

<text>Racetrack is a paper and pencil game that simulates a car race, played by two or more players. The game is played on a squared sheet of paper, with a pencil line tracking each car&#x27;s movement. The rules for moving represent a car with a certain inertia and physical limits on traction, and the resulting line is reminiscent of how real racing cars move. The game requires players to slow down before bends in the track, and requires some foresight and planning for successful play. The game is popular as an educational tool teaching vectors.

The game is also known under names such as Vector Formula, Vector Rally, Vector Race, Graph Racers, PolyRace, Paper and pencil racing, or the Graph paper race game.

==The basic game==
The rules are here explained in simple terms. As will follow from a later section, if the mathematical concept of vectors is known, some of the rules may be stated more briefly. The rules may also be stated in terms of the physical concepts velocity and acceleration.

===The track===
On a sheet of quadrille paper (&quot;quad pad&quot;, e.g. Letter preprinted with a 1/4&quot; square grid, or A4 with a 5 mm square grid), a freehand loop is drawn as the outer boundary of the racetrack. A large ellipse will do for a first game, but some irregularities are needed to make the game interesting. Another freehand loop is drawn inside the first. It can be more or less parallel with the outer loop, or the track can have wider and narrower spots (pinch spots), with usually at least two squares between the loops. A straight starting and finishing line is drawn across the two loops, and a direction for the race is chosen (e.g., counter clockwise).

===Preparing to play===
The order of players is agreed upon. Each player chooses a color or mark (such as x and o) to represent the player&#x27;s car. Each player marks a starting point for their car - a grid intersection at or behind the starting line.

===The moves===

All moves will be from one grid point to another grid point. Each grid point has eight neighbouring grid points: Up, down, left, right, and the four diagonal directions. Players take turns to move their cars according to some simple rules. Each move is marked by drawing a line from the starting point of this move to a new point.
* Each player&#x27;s first move must be to one of the eight neighbours of their starting position. (The player can also choose to stand still.)
* On each turn after that, the player can choose to move the same number of squares in the same direction as on the previous turn; the grid point reached by this move is called the &quot;principal point&quot; for this turn. (E.g., if the previous move was four squares to the right and two squares upwards, then the principal point is found by moving another four squares to the right and two more squares upwards.) However, the player also has the choice of any of the eight neighbours of this principal point.
* Cars must stay within the boundaries of the racetrack; otherwise they crash.

===Finding a winner===
The winner is the first player to complete a lap (cross the finish line).

==Additional and alternative rules==
Combining the following rules in various ways, there are many variants of the game.

===The track===

The track need not be a closed curve; the starting and finishing lines could be different.

Before starting to play, the players may go over the track, agreeing in advance about each grid point near the boundaries as to whether that point is inside or outside the track.

Alternatively, the track may be drawn with straight lines only, with corners at grid points only. This removes the need to decide dubious points. Players may or may not be allowed to touch the walls, but not to cross them.

===The moves===

Instead of allowing moves to any of eight neighbours of the principal point, one may use the four neighbours rule, limiting moves to the principal point or any of its &quot;four&quot; nearest neighbours.

When drawing the track, slippery regions with oil spill may be marked, wherein the cars cannot change velocity at all, or only according to the four neighbours rule. Also, turbo regions may be marked with an arrow with a specific length and direction, wherein possible moves are given by a principal point displaced as indicated by the arrow. These rules may apply to all moves either &quot;beginning in&quot;, or &quot;ending in&quot;, or &quot;beginning and ending in&quot;, or &quot;passing through&quot;, the marked region.

===Collisions and crashes===
Usually, cars are required to stay on the track for the entire length of the move, not just the start and end. On heavily convoluted racetracks, allowing the line segment representing a move to cross the boundary twice (with start and end points inside the track), some unreasonable shortcuts may be allowed.

Several cars may be allowed to occupy the same point simultaneously. However, the most common and entertaining rule is that while the line segments are allowed to intersect, a car cannot move to or through a grid point that is occupied by another car, as they would collide.

If a player is unable to move according to these rules, the player has crashed. A crashed car may leave the game, or various systems for penalizing crashes can be devised.

A player running off the track may be allowed to continue, but is required to brake and turn around, and re-enter the track again crossing the boundary at a point &quot;behind&quot; the point where it left. At high speeds, this will take a considerable number of moves.

Another possibility is to penalize a car with &quot;damage points&quot; for each crash. E.g., if it runs off the track or collides, it receives 1 damage point for each square of the last movement, and comes to an immediate stand-still. A car with 5 damage points, say, cannot run anymore.

===Finding a winner===

At the end of the game, one may complete a round. E.g., with three players A, B and C (starting on that order), if B is the first to cross the finish line, C is allowed one more move to complete the A-B-C cycle. The winner is the player whose car is the greatest distance beyond the finish line.

If the collision rule mentioned above is used, there is still a considerable advantage in moving first. This may be partially counterbalanced by having the players choose their individual starting points in reverse order. E.g., first C chooses a start point, then B, then A. Then, A makes the first move, followed by B, then C.

Another possible rule is to let the loser move first in the next game.

==Mathematics and physics==
Each move may be represented by a vector. E.g., a move four squares to the right and two up may be represented by the vector (4,2).

The eight neighbour rule allows changing each coordinate of the vector by ±1. E.g., if the previous move was (4,2), the next one may be any of the following nine:
::(3,3) (4,3) (5,3)
::(3,2) (4,2) (5,2)
::(3,1) (4,1) (5,1)

If each round represents 1 second and each square represents 1 metre, the vector representing each move is a velocity vector in metres per second. The four neighbour rule allows accelerations up to 1 metre per second squared, and the eight neighbours rule allows accelerations up to metres per second squared. A more realistic maximum acceleration for car racing would be 10 metres per second squared, e.g. corresponding to assuming each round to represent a reaction time of 0.5 seconds, and each square to represent 2.5 metres (using 4 neighbour rule).

The speed built up by acceleration can only be reduced at the same rate. This restriction reflects the inertia or momentum of the car. Note that in physics, speeding, braking, and turning right or left all are forms of acceleration, represented by one vector. For a sports car, having the same maximum acceleration without loss of traction in all directions is not unrealistic; see Circle of forces. Note, however, that the circle of forces strictly applies to an individual tyre rather than an entire vehicle, that a slightly elongated ellipse would be more realistic than a circle, and that the theory of traction involving this circle or ellipse is quite simplified.

==History and contemporary use==
The origins of the game are unknown, but it certainly existed as early as the 1960s. The rules for the game, and a sample track game was published by Martin Gardner in January 1973 in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;; and it was again described in &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine, in August 1973, page 65. Today, the game is used by math and physics teachers around the world when teaching vectors and kinematics. However, the game has a certain charm of its own, and may be played as a pure recreation.

Martin Gardner noted that the game was &quot;virtually unknown&quot; in the United States, and called it &quot;a truly remarkable simulation of automobile racing&quot;. He mentions having learned the game from Jürg Nievergelt, &quot;a computer scientist at the University of Illinois who picked it up on a recent trip to Switzerland&quot;. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; described it as having an &quot;almost supernatural&quot; resemblance to actual racing, commenting that &quot;If you enter a turn too rapidly, you &quot;will&quot; spin. If you &quot;brake&quot; too early, it will take you longer to accelerate out of the turn.&quot;

Triplanetary was a science fiction rocket ship racing game that was sold commercially between 1973 and 1981. It used similar rules to Racetrack but on a hexagonal grid and with the spaceships being placed in the center of the grid cells rather than at the vertices. The game used a laminated board which could be written on with a grease pencil.

<text>Uttoxeter ( , ) is a market town and civil parish in the East Staffordshire borough of Staffordshire, England. It is near to the Derbyshire county border. 

The town is from Burton upon Trent via the A50 and the A38, from Stafford via the A518, from Stoke-on-Trent via the A50, and from Derby via the A50 and the A38, and north-east of Rugeley via the A518 and the B5013.

The population was 14,014 at the 2021 Census.

The town&#x27;s literary connections include Samuel Johnson and Mary Howitt.

==History==

Uttoxeter&#x27;s name has been spelt at least 79 ways since it appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wotocheshede&quot;: it probably came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Wuttuceshǣddre&quot;, meaning &quot;Wuttuc&#x27;s homestead on the heath&quot;. Some historians have pointed to pre-Roman settlement here; axes from the Bronze Age discovered in the town are now on display in the Potteries Museum in Stoke-on-Trent. It is possible that Uttoxeter was the location of some form of Roman activity, due to its strategic position on the River Dove and its closeness to the large garrison forts at Rocester between 69 and 400 AD, and the recently discovered fort at Stramshall. However, little corroborating archaeological evidence has been found.

Uttoxeter saw the last major royalist surrender of the English Civil War, on 25 August 1648, when James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton surrendered to Parliamentarian General John Lambert.

Perhaps the most famous historical event to have occurred in Uttoxeter is an act of penance by Samuel Johnson. Johnson&#x27;s father ran a bookstall on Uttoxeter market, and young Samuel once refused to help out on the stall. When Johnson was older, he stood in the rain without a hat, as penance for his failure to assist his father. The event is commemorated by the Johnson Memorial, which stands in Market Place in the town centre. He is also remembered in the name of Johnson Road.

Mary Howitt, the Quaker writer of the poem &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot;, grew up in Uttoxeter. The town influenced some of her poems and novels and fuelled her love of natural history, which also featured in her books. Howitt Crescent, a residential road in the town, was named after her. The house where she lived, Howitt Place, is still standing in Balance Street.

Thomas Fradgley, Uttoxeter&#x27;s own architect designed Uttoxeter Town Hall (1854), the Johnson Memorial (1854), St Michael&#x27;s Church, Stramshall, St Lawrence Church, Bramshall (1835), St Mary&#x27;s Church, Uttoxeter, and Marchington Church. He was involved with Pugin and other architects in designs for the 16th Earl of Shrewsbury at Alton Towers including the figures of the Talbot Hounds at the entrance tower (1830), the Angel Corbels in the Lady chapel, 1833, Alton Towers Chapel with Joseph Potter (completed in 1833), Swiss Cottage, and Harper&#x27;s Cottage, Farley. He was the architect who improved several local schools, including Uttoxeter National School, Hanbury Free School (enlarged in 1848), national schools at Oakamoor, Cauldon, Alton, and Draycott School, Hanbury. He married Clara Warner from Bramshall. Their only child Thomas died aged six. Thomas Fradgley died in 1883 aged 83.

Bunting&#x27;s brewery had occupied a large area of the centre of the town since the Victorian era. It ceased production in the 1929 after being bought by Parkers Brewery of Burslem, later part of Ind Coope. The remains of the brewery were demolished in the 1960s to make way for the Maltings shopping precinct and car park. The turret clock from the brewery, which had been languishing in the basement of the town hall, was refurbished and installed above the entrance to the Costa Coffee shop in the Carters Square Shopping Centre shortly before the centre opened in 2014.

In 2008, Uttoxeter marked the 700th anniversary of its market charter of 1308, which underpins the markets held on Saturdays and Wednesdays and on other festival days. The 1308 charter followed a more general Royal Charter granted to the town&#x27;s burgesses in 1252.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Uttoxeter, at civil parish (town), district and county level: Uttoxeter Town Council, East Staffordshire Borough Council, and Staffordshire County Council. The town council is based at Uttoxeter Town Hall on the High Street.
Uttoxeter was an ancient parish. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894 it was given a parish council and included in the Uttoxeter Rural District. Shortly afterwards it was decided to create an urban district covering the town, making it independent from the rural district council. It was concluded that the whole parish was not suitable to be an urban district, so the rural parts of the parish were made a separate parish called Uttoxeter Rural which stayed in the rural district, whilst the rest became the Uttoxeter Urban District in 1896. In 1899 the urban district council purchased the Town Hall, which had been built in 1854.

Uttoxeter Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the new district of East Staffordshire. A successor parish was created covering the former urban district, with its parish council taking the name Uttoxeter Town Council.

==Economy==
In 1945, Joseph Cyril Bamford founded J C Bamford Excavators Limited in Uttoxeter, now known as JCB. The firm, based in the nearby village of Rocester, is the world&#x27;s third-largest construction equipment manufacturer. The firm&#x27;s first vehicle was a tipping trailer made from war-surplus materials, which J. C. Bamford built in a rented lock-up garage in Uttoxeter. The Bamford family had previously started Bamfords, later Bamford International Farm Machinery which was a large employer in the town from the end of the 19th century through to the early 1980s, when it gradually declined before closing in 1989. The land and former building were acquired by JCB for its &quot;Special Products&quot; division. This has now closed and the buildings have been demolished, but the site has yet to be redeveloped. JCB has other factories in Uttoxeter, Cheadle, Foston and Wrexham, and abroad in the United States and India.

Elkes Biscuits, previously Fox&#x27;s Biscuits, has a factory in Uttoxeter. Elkes was the creator of the malted milk biscuit. Glennans Crisps, specialising in vegetable crisps, is based in the town. It was bought by Tyrrells Crisps in 2012.

Uttoxeter Racecourse, home to the Midlands Grand National, brings visitors to the town centre shops and markets. Proximity to the Alton Towers Resort, St. George&#x27;s Park National Football Centre and the Peak District National Park means tourism is important to the local economy. 

Agriculture remains important, as the town is set in rich dairy farming country. Uttoxeter previously housed a large dairy and was historically a major trader in butter and cheese. The farming cooperative Dairy Farmers of Britain had another large dairy in the nearby village of Fole, but this closed in 2008 and the firm went into administration the next year. A new cattle market was due to be built in the town after the old one was demolished in 2004, having stood dormant since the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak. No progress was made and it is now unlikely after ten years that the town will regain one, the land now having been redeveloped into a pedestrianised shopping area, composed of an Asda store, GP surgery and retail outlets.

===Recent development===

Uttoxeter town centre underwent a development scheme in 2006–2007, with the Market Place, Market Street, Queens Street, Carter Street, and High Street receiving new stone paving and street furniture.
Phased development of Dovefields Retail Park began in 1998 with a Tesco supermarket on the edge of the town and expansion in 2002 with seven large retail outlets. In 2005 an entertainment development with a bowling alley, an ice rink, a cinema, a children&#x27;s crèche, a fitness centre and business units was built.

The old Cattle Market closed in November 2005 in favour of a retail and housing development, Carter Square, opening in 2014. This features a supermarket, a range of smaller retail units and a medical surgery.

The replacement cattle market, granted planning permission on the outskirts of the town, failed to appear after several years. A municipal recycling depot has opened on part of the site.

The JCB site in the centre of Uttoxeter was demolished in 2009 after the firm moved to one of its sites on the edge of town. This site is currently undergoing redevelopment: a Waitrose store opened there in 2016 and an Aldi store opened there in 2022. The Lidl store, previously located between Dovefields Retail Park and the town centre relocated several hundred meters along the road to a new unit built on land previously used for light industry. Plans have been approved for hundreds of homes, a park and business units.

In 2019, the Uttoxeter Brewing Company began licensed operations in a purpose built property sharing the car park of the White Hart Hotel in the town centre, the first commercial brewing operations in the town since the closure of Bunting&#x27;s Brewery in 1929.

==Demography==
According to the 2021 census the population for Uttoxeter Civil Parish was 14,014. 96% of the population are White British and 95% are UK born. The population is relatively stable with an annual population growth of 0.38% between 2011 and 2021.

==Transport==

Uttoxeter has a railway station, opened originally by the North Staffordshire Railway on 2 October 1881 to replace earlier stations. It is served by trains on the Crewe-Derby Line, which generally operate hourly each way between Crewe and Newark Castle.

The bus station offers services operated by Diamond (formerly Midland Classic), Chaserider, Trent Barton and Select Bus. Connections can be made to Cheadle, Burton upon Trent, Stoke on Trent, Derby, Stafford, Cannock and Rugeley. Service 406 provides a circular service to surrounding estates. An Alton Towers service also operates during the summer season. The Tesco store acts as an interchange with most services using the bus stop outside the store.

The town is located on the main A50 trunk road between Stoke-on-Trent and Derby.

Uttoxeter was once the terminus of a branch of the Caldon Canal (the Uttoxeter Canal), but most signs of this, apart from an area of Uttoxeter called &quot;The Wharf&quot;, have disappeared; this is because much of the canal bed was used in the 19th century for the North Staffordshire Railway main line from Uttoxeter to Macclesfield, which has now also disappeared.

The nearest airport is East Midlands, some 29 miles (47 km) away.

==Public services==

Policing in Uttoxeter is provided from the Staffordshire Police station in Balance Street. HM Prison Dovegate, in the nearby village of Marchington, is a Category B men&#x27;s private prison operated by the Serco. HM Prison Sudbury, just over six miles away beyond the Derbyshire boundary, is operated by HM Prison Service as a Category D men&#x27;s open prison.

The statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Uttoxeter Fire Station is in Cheadle Road in the north of the town.

Uttoxeter has no hospital. It is served by the nearby Queen&#x27;s Hospital in Burton upon Trent, County Hospital in Stafford, University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent and Royal Derby Hospital. There is no ambulance station, but a team of Rapid Response Paramedics is based here and supported by volunteer Community first responders.

The utility firm South Staffordshire Water manages Uttoxeter&#x27;s drinking water and Severn Trent its waste water.

Alton Towers Resort is some from Uttoxeter. The Peak District National Park is about 20 miles away.

The Uttoxeter Casket, also known as Dr Nelson&#x27;s Casket, is an Anglo-Saxon reliquary rediscovered in a cottage in Croxden in the mid-19th century. The origin of the casket is unknown but likely the ruined Croxden Abbey. It is currently held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, Ohio.

In one episode, two obnoxious business entrepreneurs who run various companies in Uttoxeter throughout the series develop grand plans for a popular sports centre. The sketch derives its humour from the fact that Uttoxeter is in fact a quiet and sedate town.

The town featured in &quot;Countryfile&quot;, as a &quot;mystery town&quot;. Its cattle market featured in the programme as the last in the town centre site in 2005. Local people participated in the programme from the local &quot;Uttoxeter Advertiser&quot; and Uttoxeter Racecourse staff.

<text>Rosetta was a space probe built by the European Space Agency launched on 2 March 2004. Along with &quot;Philae&quot;, its lander module, &quot;Rosetta&quot; performed a detailed study of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P). During its journey to the comet, the spacecraft performed flybys of Earth, Mars, and the asteroids 21 Lutetia and 2867 Šteins. It was launched as the third cornerstone mission of the ESA&#x27;s Horizon 2000 programme, after &quot;SOHO&quot;&quot;Cluster&quot; and &quot;XMM-Newton&quot;.

On 6 August 2014, the spacecraft reached the comet and performed a series of manoeuvers to eventually orbit the comet at distances of . On 12 November, its lander module &quot;Philae&quot; performed the first successful landing on a comet, though its battery power ran out two days later. Communications with &quot;Philae&quot; were briefly restored in June and July 2015, but due to diminishing solar power, &quot;Rosetta&quot; communications module with the lander was turned off on 27 July 2016. On 30 September 2016, the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft ended its mission by hard-landing on the comet in its Ma&#x27;at region.

The probe was named after the Rosetta Stone, a stele of Egyptian origin featuring a decree in three scripts. The lander was named after the Philae obelisk, which bears a bilingual Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription.

== Mission overview ==

&quot;Rosetta&quot; was launched on 2 March 2004 from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana, on an Ariane 5 rocket and reached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 7 May 2014. It performed a series of manoeuvres to enter orbit between then and 6 August 2014, when it became the first spacecraft to orbit a comet. (Previous missions had conducted successful flybys of seven other comets.) It was one of ESA&#x27;s Horizon 2000 cornerstone missions. The spacecraft consisted of the &quot;Rosetta&quot; orbiter, which featured 12 instruments, and the &quot;Philae&quot; lander, with nine additional instruments. The &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission orbited Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko for 17 months and was designed to complete the most detailed study of a comet ever attempted. The spacecraft was controlled from the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC), in Darmstadt, Germany. The planning for the operation of the scientific payload, together with the data retrieval, calibration, archiving and distribution, was performed from the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), in Villanueva de la Cañada, near Madrid, Spain. It has been estimated that in the decade preceding 2014, some 2,000 people assisted in the mission in some capacity.

In 2007, &quot;Rosetta&quot; made a Mars gravity assist (flyby) on its way to Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko. The spacecraft also performed two asteroid flybys. The craft completed its flyby of asteroid 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and of 21 Lutetia in July 2010. Later, on 20 January 2014, &quot;Rosetta&quot; was taken out of a 31-month hibernation mode as it approached Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

&quot;Rosetta&quot; &quot;Philae&quot; lander successfully made the first soft landing on a comet nucleus when it touched down on Comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014. On 5 September 2016, ESA announced that the lander was discovered by the narrow-angle camera aboard &quot;Rosetta&quot; as the orbiter made a low, pass over the comet. The lander sits on its side wedged into a dark crevice of the comet, explaining the lack of electrical power to establish proper communication with the orbiter.

== History ==

=== Background ===
During the 1986 approach of Halley&#x27;s Comet, international space probes were sent to explore the comet, most prominent among them being ESA&#x27;s &quot;Giotto&quot;. After the probes returned valuable scientific information, it became obvious that follow-ons were needed that would shed more light on cometary composition and answer new questions.

Both ESA and NASA started cooperatively developing new probes. The NASA project was the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission. The ESA project was the follow-on Comet Nucleus Sample Return (CNSR) mission. Both missions were to share the Mariner Mark II spacecraft design, thus minimising costs. In 1992, after NASA cancelled CRAF due to budgetary limitations, ESA decided to develop a CRAF-style project on its own. By 1993 it was evident that the ambitious sample return mission was infeasible with the existing ESA budget, so the mission was redesigned and subsequently approved by the ESA, with the final flight plan resembling the cancelled CRAF mission: an asteroid flyby followed by a comet rendezvous with in-situ examination, including a lander. After the spacecraft launch, Gerhard Schwehm was named mission manager; he retired in March 2014.

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission included generational team management; this allowed mission continuity over the long period of the mission and for special knowledge to be maintained and passed on to future team members. In particular, several younger scientists were brought on as principal science investigators, and regular training sessions were conducted.

=== Naming ===
The probe was named after the Rosetta Stone, a stele of Egyptian origin featuring a decree in three scripts. The lander was named after the Philae obelisk, which bears a bilingual Greek and Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription. A comparison of its hieroglyphs with those on the Rosetta Stone catalysed the deciphering of the Egyptian writing system. Similarly, it was hoped that these spacecraft would result in better understanding of comets and the early Solar System. In a more direct analogy to its namesake, the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft also carried a micro-etched pure nickel prototype of the Rosetta disc donated by the Long Now Foundation. The disc was inscribed with 6,500 pages of language translations.

=== Mission firsts ===

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission achieved many historic firsts.

On its way to comet 67P, &quot;Rosetta&quot; passed through the main asteroid belt, and made the first European close encounter with several of these primitive objects. &quot;Rosetta&quot; was the first spacecraft to fly close to Jupiter&#x27;s orbit using solar cells as its main power source.

&quot;Rosetta&quot; was the first spacecraft to orbit a comet nucleus, and was the first spacecraft to fly alongside a comet as it headed towards the inner Solar System. It became the first spacecraft to examine at close proximity the activity of a frozen comet as it is warmed by the Sun. Shortly after its arrival at 67P, the &quot;Rosetta&quot; orbiter dispatched the &quot;Philae&quot; lander for the first controlled touchdown on a comet nucleus. The robotic lander&#x27;s instruments obtained the first images from a comet&#x27;s surface and made the first &quot;in situ&quot; analysis of its composition.

=== Design and construction ===
The &quot;Rosetta&quot; bus was a central frame and aluminium honeycomb platform. Its total mass was approximately , which included the &quot;Philae&quot; lander and of science instruments. The Payload Support Module was mounted on top of the spacecraft and housed the scientific instruments, while the Bus Support Module was on the bottom and contained spacecraft support subsystems. Heaters placed around the spacecraft kept its systems warm while it was distant from the Sun. &quot;Rosetta&quot; communications suite included a steerable high-gain parabolic dish antenna, a fixed-position medium-gain antenna, and two omnidirectional low-gain antennas.

Electrical power for the spacecraft came from two solar arrays totalling . Each solar array was subdivided into five solar panels, with each panel being . The individual solar cells were made of silicon, 200 μm thick, and . The solar arrays generated a maximum of approximately 1,500 watts at perihelion, a minimum of 400 watts in hibernation mode at 5.2 AU, and 850 watts when comet operations begin at 3.4 AU. Spacecraft power was controlled by a redundant Terma power module also used in the &quot;Mars Express&quot; spacecraft, and was stored in four 10-A·h [Li-ion] batteries supplying 28 volts to the bus.

Main propulsion comprised 24 paired bipropellant 10 N thrusters, with four pairs of thrusters being used for delta-&quot;v&quot; burns. The spacecraft carried of propellant at launch: of monomethylhydrazine fuel and of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser, contained in two grade 5 titanium alloy tanks and providing delta-&quot;v&quot; of at least over the course of the mission. Propellant pressurisation was provided by two high-pressure helium tanks.

&quot;Rosetta&quot; was built in a clean room according to COSPAR rules, but &quot;sterilisation generally not crucial since comets are usually regarded as objects where you can find prebiotic molecules, that is, molecules that are precursors of life, but not living microorganisms&quot;, according to Gerhard Schwehm, &quot;Rosetta&quot; project scientist. The total cost of the mission was about €1.3 billion (US$1.8 billion).

=== Launch ===
&quot;Rosetta&quot; was set to be launched on 12 January 2003 to rendezvous with the comet 46P/Wirtanen in 2011. This plan was abandoned after the failure of an Ariane 5 ECA carrier rocket during Hot Bird 7&#x27;s launch on 11 December 2002, grounding it until the cause of the failure could be determined. In May 2003, a new plan was formed to target the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, with a revised launch date of 26 February 2004 and comet rendezvous in 2014. The larger mass and the resulting increased impact velocity made modification of the landing gear necessary.

After two scrubbed launch attempts, &quot;Rosetta&quot; was launched on 2 March 2004 at 07:17 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, using Ariane 5 G+ carrier rocket. Aside from the changes made to launch time and target, the mission profile remained almost identical. Both co-discoverers of the comet, Klim Churyumov and Svetlana Gerasimenko, were present at the spaceport during the launch.

=== Deep space manoeuvres ===
To achieve the required velocity to rendezvous with 67P, &quot;Rosetta&quot; used gravity assist manoeuvres to accelerate throughout the inner Solar System. The comet&#x27;s orbit was known before &quot;Rosetta&quot; launch, from ground-based measurements, to an accuracy of approximately . Information gathered by the onboard cameras beginning at a distance of were processed at ESA&#x27;s Operation Centre to refine the position of the comet in its orbit to a few kilometres.

The first Earth flyby was on 4 March 2005.

On 25 February 2007, the craft was scheduled for a low-altitude flyby of Mars, to correct the trajectory. This was not without risk, as the estimated altitude of the flyby was a mere . During that encounter, the solar panels could not be used since the craft was in the planet&#x27;s shadow, where it would not receive any solar light for 15 minutes, causing a dangerous shortage of power. The craft was therefore put into standby mode, with no possibility to communicate, flying on batteries that were originally not designed for this task. This Mars manoeuvre was therefore nicknamed &quot;The Billion Euro Gamble&quot;. The flyby was successful, with &quot;Rosetta&quot; even returning detailed images of the surface and atmosphere of the planet, and the mission continued as planned.

The second Earth flyby was on 13 November 2007 at a distance of . In observations made on 7 and 8 November, &quot;Rosetta&quot; was briefly mistaken for a near-Earth asteroid about in diameter by an astronomer of the Catalina Sky Survey and was given the provisional designation . Calculations showed that it would pass very close to Earth, which led to speculation that it could impact Earth. However, astronomer Denis Denisenko recognised that the trajectory matched that of &quot;Rosetta&quot;, which the Minor Planet Center confirmed in an editorial release on 9 November.

The spacecraft performed a close flyby of asteroid 2867 Šteins on 5 September 2008. Its onboard cameras were used to fine-tune the trajectory, achieving a minimum separation of less than . Onboard instruments measured the asteroid from 4 August to 10 September. Maximum relative speed between the two objects during the flyby was .

&quot;Rosetta&quot; third and final flyby of Earth happened on 12 November 2009 at a distance of .

On 10 July 2010, &quot;Rosetta&quot; flew by 21 Lutetia, a large main-belt asteroid, at a minimum distance of  km ( mi) at a velocity of . The flyby provided images of up to per pixel resolution and covered about 50% of the surface, mostly in the northern hemisphere. The 462 images were obtained in 21 narrow- and broad-band filters extending from 0.24 to 1 μm. Lutetia was also observed by the visible–near-infrared imaging spectrometer VIRTIS, and measurements of the magnetic field and plasma environment were taken as well.


After leaving its hibernation mode in January 2014 and getting closer to the comet, &quot;Rosetta&quot; began a series of eight burns in May 2014. These reduced the relative velocity between the spacecraft and 67P from .

=== Reaction control system problems ===
In 2006, &quot;Rosetta&quot; suffered a leak in its reaction control system (RCS). The system, which consists of 24 bipropellant 10-newton thrusters, was responsible for fine tuning the trajectory of &quot;Rosetta&quot; throughout its journey. The RCS operated at a lower pressure than designed due to the leak. While this may have caused the propellants to mix incompletely and burn &#x27;dirtier&#x27; and less efficiently, ESA engineers were confident that the spacecraft would have sufficient fuel reserves to allow for the successful completion of the mission.

Prior to &quot;Rosetta&quot; deep space hibernation period, two of the spacecraft&#x27;s four reaction wheels began exhibiting increased levels of &quot;bearing friction noise&quot;. Increased friction levels in Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) B were noted after its September 2008 encounter with asteroid Šteins. Two attempts were made to relubricate the RWA using an on-board oil reservoir, but in each case noise levels were only temporarily lowered, and the RWA was turned off in mid-2010 after the flyby of asteroid Lutetia to avoid possible failure. Shortly after this, RWA C also began showing evidence of elevated friction. Relubrication was also performed on this RWA, and methods were found to temporarily increase its operating temperature to better improve the transfer of oil from its reservoir. In addition, the reaction wheel&#x27;s speed range was decreased to limit lifetime accumulated rotations. These changes resulted in RWA C performance stabilising.

During the spacecraft&#x27;s Deep Space Hibernation flight phase, engineers performed ground testing on a flight spare RWA at the European Space Operations Centre. After &quot;Rosetta&quot; exited hibernation in January 2014, lessons learned from the ground testing were applied to all four RWAs, such as increasing their operating temperatures and limiting their wheel speeds to below 1000 rpm. After these fixes, the RWAs showed nearly identical performance data. Three RWAs were kept operational, while one of the malfunctioning RWAs was held in reserve. Additionally, new on-board software was developed to allow &quot;Rosetta&quot; to operate with only two active RWAs if necessary. These changes allowed the four RWAs to operate throughout &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission at 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko despite occasional anomalies in their friction plots and a heavy workload imposed by numerous orbital changes.

=== Orbit around 67P ===

In August 2014, &quot;Rosetta&quot; rendezvoused with the comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko (67P) and commenced a series of manoeuvres that took it on two successive triangular paths, averaging from the nucleus, whose segments are hyperbolic escape trajectories alternating with thruster burns. After closing to within about from the comet on 10 September, the spacecraft entered actual orbit about it.

The surface layout of 67P was unknown before &quot;Rosetta&quot; arrival. The orbiter mapped the comet in anticipation of detaching its lander. By 25 August 2014, five potential landing sites had been determined. On 15 September 2014, ESA announced Site J, named &quot;Agilkia&quot; in honour of Agilkia Island by an ESA public contest and located on the &quot;head&quot; of the comet, as the lander&#x27;s destination.

=== &quot;Philae&quot; lander ===
&quot;Philae&quot; detached from &quot;Rosetta&quot; on 12 November 2014 at 08:35 UTC, and approached 67P at a relative speed of about . It initially landed on 67P at 15:33 UTC, but bounced twice, coming to rest at 17:33 UTC. Confirmation of contact with 67P reached Earth at 16:03 UTC.

On contact with the surface, two harpoons were to be fired into the comet to prevent the lander from bouncing off, as the comet&#x27;s escape velocity is only around . Analysis of telemetry indicated that the surface at the initial touchdown site is relatively soft, covered with a layer of granular material about deep, and that the harpoons had not fired upon landing. After landing on the comet, &quot;Philae&quot; had been scheduled to commence its science mission, which included:
* Characterisation of the nucleus
* Determination of the chemical compounds present, including amino acid enantiomers
* Study of comet activities and developments over time

After bouncing, &quot;Philae&quot; settled in the shadow of a cliff, canted at an angle of around 30 degrees. This made it unable to adequately collect solar power, and it lost contact with &quot;Rosetta&quot; when its batteries ran out after three days, well before much of the planned science objectives could be attempted. Contact was briefly and intermittently reestablished several months later at various times between 13 June and 9 July, before contact was lost once again. There was no communication afterwards, and the transmitter to communicate with &quot;Philae&quot; was switched off in July 2016 to reduce power consumption of the probe. The precise location of the lander was discovered in September 2016 when &quot;Rosetta&quot; came closer to the comet and took high-resolution pictures of its surface. Knowing its exact location provides information needed to put Philae&#x27;s two days of science into proper context.

=== Notable results ===

Researchers expect the study of data gathered will continue for decades to come. One of the first discoveries was that the magnetic field of 67P oscillated at 40–50 millihertz. A German composer and sound designer created an artistic rendition from the measured data to make it audible. Although it is a natural phenomenon, it has been described as a &quot;song&quot; and has been compared to &quot;Continuum&quot; for harpsichord by György Ligeti. However, results from &quot;Philae&quot; landing show that the comet&#x27;s nucleus has no magnetic field, and that the field originally detected by &quot;Rosetta&quot; is likely caused by the solar wind.

The isotopic signature of water vapour from comet 67P, as determined by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft, is substantially different from that found on Earth. That is, the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in the water from the comet was determined to be three times that found for terrestrial water. This makes it very unlikely that water found on Earth came from comets such as comet 67P, according to the scientists. On 22 January 2015, NASA reported that, between June and August 2014, the rate at which water vapour was released by the comet increased up to tenfold. 

On 2 June 2015, NASA reported that the Alice spectrograph on &quot;Rosetta&quot; determined that electrons within above the comet nucleus — produced from photoionization of water molecules, and not direct photons from the Sun as thought earlier — are responsible for the degradation of water and carbon dioxide molecules released from the comet nucleus into its coma.

=== End of mission ===

As the orbit of comet 67P took it farther from the Sun, the amount of sunlight reaching &quot;Rosetta&quot; solar panels decreased. While it would have been possible to put &quot;Rosetta&quot; into a second hibernation phase during the comet&#x27;s aphelion, there was no assurance that enough power would be available to run the spacecraft&#x27;s heaters to keep it from freezing. To guarantee a maximum science return, mission managers made the decision to instead guide &quot;Rosetta&quot; down to the comet&#x27;s surface and end the mission on impact, gathering photographs and instrument readings along the way. On 23 June 2015, at the same time as a mission extension was confirmed, ESA announced that end of mission would occur at the end of September 2016 after two years of operations at the comet.

&quot;Rosetta&quot; began a descent with a 208-second thruster burn executed on 29 September 2016 at approximately 20:50 UTC. Its trajectory targeted a site in the Ma&#x27;at region near an area of dust- and gas-producing active pits.

Impact on the comet&#x27;s surface occurred 14.5 hours after its descent manoeuvre; the final data packet from &quot;Rosetta&quot; was transmitted at 10:39:28.895 UTC (SCET) by the OSIRIS instrument and was received at the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, at 11:19:36.541 UTC. The spacecraft&#x27;s estimated speed at the time of impact was , and its touchdown location, named &quot;Sais&quot; by the operations team after the Rosetta Stone&#x27;s original temple home, is believed to be only off-target. The final complete image transmitted by the spacecraft of the comet was taken by its OSIRIS instrument at an altitude of about 10 seconds before impact, showing an area across. &quot;Rosetta&quot; computer included commands to send it into safe mode upon detecting that it had hit the comet&#x27;s surface, turning off its radio transmitter and rendering it inert in accordance with International Telecommunication Union rules.

On 28 September 2017, a previously unrecovered image taken by the spacecraft was reported. This image was recovered from three data packets discovered on a server after completion of the mission. While blurry due to data loss, it shows an area of the comet&#x27;s surface approximately one square meter in size taken from an altitude of , and represents &quot;Rosetta&quot; closest image of the surface.

== Instruments ==

=== Nucleus ===
The investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers, one microwave radio antenna and one radar:
* Alice (an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph). The ultraviolet spectrograph searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus, from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated. The detection was done by an array of potassium bromide and caesium iodide photocathodes. The instrument used 2.9 watts, with an improved version onboard New Horizons. It operated in the extreme and far ultraviolet spectrum, from . ALICE was built and operated by the Southwest Research Institute for NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
* OSIRIS (Optical, Spectroscopic, and Infrared Remote Imaging System). The camera system had a narrow-angle lens (700 mm) and a wide-angle lens (140 mm), with a 2048×2048 pixel CCD chip. The instrument was constructed in Germany. Development and construction of the instrument was led by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS).
* VIRTIS (Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer). The Visible and IR spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the IR and also search for IR spectra of molecules in the coma. The detection was done by a mercury cadmium telluride array for IR and with a CCD chip for the visible wavelength range. The instrument was produced in Italy, and improved versions were used for Dawn and Venus Express.
* MIRO (Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter). The abundance and temperature of volatile substances like water, ammonia and carbon dioxide could be detected by MIRO via their microwave emissions. The radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory with international contributions by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS), among others.
* CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission). The CONSERT experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar. The radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the &quot;Philae&quot; lander and the &quot;Rosetta&quot; orbiter through the comet nucleus. This allowed it to determine the comet&#x27;s internal structure and deduce information on its composition. The electronics were developed by France and both antennas were constructed in Germany. Development was led by the Laboratoire de Planétologie de Grenoble with contributions by the Ruhr-Universität Boch and the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS).
*RSI (Radio Science Investigation). RSI made use of the probe&#x27;s communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet.

=== Gas and particles ===
* ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis). The instrument consisted of a double-focus magnetic mass spectrometer (DFMS) and a reflectron type time of flight mass spectrometer (RTOF). The DFMS had a high resolution (could resolve N2 from CO) for molecules up to 300 amu. The RTOF was highly sensitive for neutral molecules and for ions. The Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) has contributed to the development and construction of the instrument. ROSINA was developed at the University of Bern in Switzerland.
* MIDAS (Micro-Imaging Dust Analysis System). The high-resolution atomic force microscope investigated several physical aspects of the dust particles which are deposited on a silicon plate.
* COSIMA (Cometary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser). COSIMA analysed the composition of dust particles by secondary ion mass spectrometry, using indium ions. It could detect ions up to a mass of 6500 amu. COSIMA was built by the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE, Germany) with international contributions. The COSIMA team is led by the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS, Germany).
* GIADA (Grain Impact Analyser and Dust Accumulator). GIADA analysed the dust environment of the comet coma by measuring the optical cross section, momentum, speed and mass of each grain entering inside the instrument.

=== Solar wind interaction ===
* RPC (Rosetta Plasma Consortium).

== Search for organic compounds ==
Previous observations have shown that comets contain complex organic compounds. These are the elements that make up nucleic acids and amino acids, essential ingredients for life as we know it. Comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to Earth, and they may have also seeded Earth with organic molecules. &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot; also searched for organic molecules, nucleic acids (the building blocks of DNA and RNA) and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) by sampling and analysing the comet&#x27;s nucleus and coma cloud of gas and dust, helping assess the contribution comets made to the beginnings of life on Earth. Before succumbing to falling power levels, &quot;Philae&quot; COSAC instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet&#x27;s atmosphere.

;Amino acids
Upon landing on the comet, &quot;Philae&quot; should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all &quot;left-handed&quot;, which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule. Most asymmetrical molecules are oriented in approximately equal numbers of left- and right-handed configurations (chirality), and the primarily left-handed structure of essential amino acids used by living organisms is unique. One hypothesis that will be tested was proposed in 1983 by William A. Bonner and Edward Rubenstein, Stanford University professors emeritus of chemistry and medicine respectively. They conjectured that when spiralling radiation is generated from a supernova, the circular polarisation of that radiation could then destroy one type of &quot;handed&quot; molecules. The supernova could wipe out one type of molecules while also flinging the other surviving molecules into space, where they could eventually end up on a planet.

=== Preliminary results ===

The mission has yielded a significant science return, collecting a wealth of data from the nucleus and its environment at various levels of cometary activity. The VIRTIS spectrometer on board the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67P with little to no water ice visible. Preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys.

Solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet; the carbon in this organic material is bound in &quot;very large macromolecular compounds&quot;, analogous to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. However, no hydrated minerals were detected, suggesting no link with carbonaceous chondrites.

In turn, the &quot;Philae&quot; lander&#x27;s COSAC instrument detected organic molecules in the comet&#x27;s atmosphere as it descended to its surface. Measurements by the COSAC and Ptolemy instruments on the &quot;Philae&quot; lander revealed sixteen organic compounds, four of which were seen for the first time on a comet, including acetamide, acetone, methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde. The only amino acid detected thus far on the comet is glycine, along with the precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine.

One of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen () gas surrounding the comet. A local abundance of oxygen was reported to be in range from 1% to 10% relative to H2O.

* 4 March – &quot;Rosetta&quot; executed its first planned close swing-by (gravity assist passage) of Earth. The Moon and the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field were used to test and calibrate the instruments on board of the spacecraft. The minimum altitude above the Earth&#x27;s surface was .
* 4 July – Imaging instruments on board observed the collision between the comet Tempel 1 and the impactor of the Deep Impact mission.

;2007
* 25 February – Mars flyby.
* 8 November – Catalina Sky Survey briefly misidentified the &quot;Rosetta&quot; spacecraft, approaching for its second Earth flyby, as a newly discovered asteroid.
* 13 November – Second Earth swing-by at a minimum altitude of , travelling at .
;2008
* 5 September – Flyby of asteroid 2867 Šteins. The spacecraft passed the main-belt asteroid at a distance of and the relatively slow speed of .

;2009
* 13 November – Third and final swing-by of Earth at .

;2010
* 16 March – Observation of the dust tail of asteroid P/2010 A2. Together with observations by Hubble Space Telescope it could be confirmed that P/2010 A2 is not a comet, but an asteroid, and that the tail most likely consists of particles from an impact by a smaller asteroid.
* 10 July – Flew by and photographed the asteroid 21 Lutetia.

;2014
* May to July – Starting on 7 May, &quot;Rosetta&quot; began orbital correction manoeuvres to bring itself into orbit around 67P. At the time of the first deceleration burn &quot;Rosetta&quot; was approximately away from 67P and had a relative velocity of +; by the end of the last burn, which occurred on 23 July, the distance had been reduced to just over with a relative velocity of +. In total eight burns were used to align the trajectories of &quot;Rosetta&quot; 67P with the majority of the deceleration occurring during three burns: Delta-&quot;v&quot; of on 21 May, on 4 June, and on 18 June.
* 14 July – The OSIRIS on-board imaging system returned images of comet 67P which confirmed the irregular shape of the comet.
* 6 August – &quot;Rosetta&quot; arrives at 67P, approaching to and carrying out a thruster burn that reduces its relative velocity to . Commences comet mapping and characterisation to determine a stable orbit and viable landing location for &quot;Philae&quot;.
* 4 September – The first science data from &quot;Rosetta&quot; Alice instrument was reported, showing that the comet is unusually dark in ultraviolet wavelengths, hydrogen and oxygen are present in the coma, and no significant areas of water-ice have been found on the comet&#x27;s surface. Water-ice was expected to be found as the comet is too far from the Sun to turn water into vapour.
* 10 September 2014 – &quot;Rosetta&quot; enters the Global Mapping Phase, orbiting 67P at an altitude of .
* 12 November 2014 – &quot;Philae&quot; lands on the surface of 67P.
* 10 December 2014 – Data from the ROSINA mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67P is more than three times that on Earth. The ratio is regarded as a distinctive signature, and the discovery means that Earth&#x27;s water is unlikely to have originated from comets like 67P.

;2015
* 14 April 2015 – Scientists report that the comet&#x27;s nucleus has no magnetic field of its own.
* 2 July 2015 – Scientists report that active pits, related to sinkhole collapses and possibly associated with outbursts, have been found on the comet.

* 11 August 2015 – Scientists release images of a comet outburst that occurred on 29 July 2015.
* 28 October 2015 – Scientists publish an article in &quot;Nature&quot; reporting high levels of molecular oxygen around 67P.
* November 2014 to December 2015 – &quot;Rosetta&quot; escorted the comet around the Sun and performed riskier investigations.

;2016
* 27 July 2016 – ESA switched off the Electrical Support System Processor Unit (ESS) aboard &quot;Rosetta&quot;, disabling any possibility of further communications with the &quot;Philae&quot; lander.
* 2 September 2016 – &quot;Rosetta&quot; photographs the &quot;Philae&quot; lander for the first time after its landing, finding it wedged against a large overhang.
* 30 September 2016 – Mission ended in an attempt to slow land on the comet&#x27;s surface near a wide pit called Deir el-Medina. The walls of the pit contain wide so-called &quot;goose bumps&quot;, believed to represent the building blocks of the comet. Although &quot;Philae&quot; sent back some data during its descent, &quot;Rosetta&quot; has more powerful and more varied sensors and instruments, offering the opportunity to get some very close-in science to complement the more distant remote sensing it has been doing. The orbiter descended more slowly than &quot;Philae&quot; did.

=== &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; cartoon ===

As part of the European Space Agency&#x27;s media campaign in support of the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, both the &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot; spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;. The series depicts various stages in the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, involving the personified &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot; on &quot;a classic road trip story into the depths of our universe&quot;, complemented with various visual gags presented in an educational context. Produced by animation studio Design &amp; Data GmbH, the series was initially conceived by the ESA as a four-part fantasy-like series with a &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; theme that promoted community involvement in &quot;Rosetta&quot;″s wake up from hibernation in January 2014. After the success of the series, however, the ESA commissioned the studio to continue producing new episodes in the series throughout the course of the mission. A total of twelve videos in the series were produced from 2013 to 2016, with a 25-minute compilation of the series released in December 2016, after the end of the mission. In 2019, Design &amp; Data adapted the series into a 26-minute planetarium show that was commissioned by the Swiss Museum of Transport, and solicited to eighteen planetariums across Europe, with an aim &quot;to inspire the young generation to explore the universe.&quot;

The &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot; characters featured in &quot;Once upon a time...&quot;, designed by ESA employee and cartoonist Carlo Palazzari, became a central part of public image of the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission, appearing in promotional material for the mission such as posters and merchandise, and often credited as a major factor in the popularity of the mission among the public. ESA employees also role-played as the characters on Twitter throughout the course of the mission. The characters were inspired by the JAXA&#x27;s &quot;kawaii&quot; characters, who portrayed a number of their spacecraft, such as &quot;Hayabusa2&quot; and &quot;Akatsuki&quot;, with distinct anime-like personalities. The script for each episode of the series is written by science communicators at the European Space Research and Technology Centre, who kept close with mission operators and the producers at Design &amp; Data. Canonically, &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Philae&quot; are depicted as siblings, with &quot;Rosetta&quot; being the older sister, inspired by the spacecraft&#x27;s feminine name, of &quot;Philae&quot;, her younger brother. The &quot;Giotto&quot; spacecraft is also depicted as the duo&#x27;s grandfather, whereas others in the Halley Armada as well as NASA&#x27;s &quot;Deep Impact&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft are depicted as their cousins.

=== &quot;Ambition&quot; ===
To promote the spacecraft&#x27;s arrival at comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko and the landing of &quot;Philae&quot; in 2014, a short film was produced by the European Space Agency with Polish visual effects production company Platige Image. Titled &quot;Ambition&quot;, the film, shot in Iceland, stars Irish actor Aidan Gillen, known for his roles in &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot;, and Irish actress Aisling Franciosi, also of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; fame, and was directed by Oscar-nominated Polish director Tomasz Bagiński. Set in the far future, &quot;Ambition&quot; centers around a discussion between a master, played by Gillen, discussing the importance of with his apprentice, played by Franciosi, using the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission as an example of such. &quot;Ambition&quot; was premiered at the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sci-Fi: Days of Fear and Wonder&quot; film festival in London on 24 October 2014, three weeks before the landing of &quot;Philae&quot; on 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. British science fiction author and former ESA employee Alastair Reynolds spoke about the film&#x27;s message at the premiere, stating to the audience that &quot;our distant descendants may look back to Rosetta with the same sense of admiration that we reserve for, say, Columbus or Magellan.&quot; The film&#x27;s conception was the result of the BFI&#x27;s inquiry to the ESA for a contribution to their celebration of science fiction, with the ESA taking the opportunity to promote the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission through the festival.

Critical reception of the film upon its premiere was mostly positive. Tim Reyes of &quot;Universe Today&quot; complimented the titular theme of ambition in the film, stating that it &quot;shows us the forces at work in and around ESA&quot;, and that it &quot;might accomplish more in 7 minutes than &quot;Gravity&quot; did in 90.&quot; Ryan Wallace of &quot;The Science Times&quot; also gave praise to the film, writing, &quot;whether you&#x27;re a sci-fi fanatic, or simply an interested humble astronomer, the short clip will undoubtedly give you a new view of our solar system, and the research out there in space today.&quot;

=== Media coverage ===
The entire mission was featured heavily in social media, with a Facebook account for the mission and both the satellite and the lander having an official Twitter account portraying a personification of both spacecraft. The hashtag &quot;#CometLanding&quot; gained widespread traction. A live stream of the control centres was set up, as were multiple official and unofficial events around the world to follow &quot;Philae&quot; landing on 67P. On 23 September 2016, Vangelis released the studio album &quot;Rosetta&quot; in honour of the mission, which was used on 30 September in the &quot;Rosetta&#x27;s final hour&quot; streaming video of the ESA Livestream event &quot;Rosetta Grand Finale&quot;.

<text>Liubo (; Old Chinese *&quot;kruk pˤak&quot; “six sticks”) was an ancient Chinese board game for two players. The rules have largely been lost, but it is believed that each player had six game pieces that were moved around the points of a square game board that had a distinctive, symmetrical pattern. Moves were determined by the throw of six sticks, which performed the same function as dice in other race games.

The game was invented no later than the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, and was popular during the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE). However, after the Han dynasty it rapidly declined in popularity, possibly due to the rise in popularity of the game of &quot;weiqi&quot; (go), and it became totally forgotten.

Knowledge of the game has increased in recent years with archeological discoveries of Liubo game boards and game equipment in ancient tombs, as well as discoveries of Han dynasty picture stones and picture bricks depicting Liubo players.

==History==
It is not known when the game of &quot;liubo&quot; originated, although according to legend it was invented by Wu Cao (烏曹, called Wu Zhou 烏胄 in the early 2nd century CE &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; dictionary), a minister to King Jie, the last king of the Xia dynasty, who according to traditional chronology reigned 1728–1675 BCE. While there is no archeological or reliable documentary evidence to support the view that &quot;liubo&quot; dates back to the Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BCE), early Chinese records do indicate that &quot;liubo&quot; was already a popular game by the Warring States period (476–221 BCE). For example, the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; records a speech made during the reign of King Xuan of Qi (reigned 319–301 BCE) that claims that the capital city of Linzi was so wealthy that its citizens were all able to indulge in activities such as playing musical instruments, cockfighting, dog racing, playing &quot;liubo&quot; and playing kick ball.

The game of &quot;liubo&quot; is also described in the mid 3rd century BCE poem &quot;Summons of the Soul&quot; (&quot;Zhao Hun&quot; 招魂) in the &quot;Songs of Chu&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

Then with bamboo dice and ivory pieces the game of Liu Bo is begun;
Sides are taken; they advance together; keenly they threaten each other.
Pieces are kinged and the scoring doubled. Shouts of ‘five white!’ arise.
Note that the line “Pieces are kinged” translates 成梟 &quot;chéng xiāo&quot; ”become an owl”. The earliest &quot;liubo&quot; boards to have been discovered are a pair of ornately decorated stonen boards from a 4th-century BCE tomb in the royal tomb complex of the State of Zhongshan at Pingshan in Hebei.
The game reached its greatest popularity during the Han dynasty, as is evidenced by the discovery of many examples of Liubo boards or sets of Liubo game pieces as grave goods in high status tombs dating to the Han dynasty. Pottery or wooden figurines of players with model Liubo boards have also been discovered in some Han tombs. Engraved picture stones (畫像石) and moulded picture bricks (畫像磚) that were widely used to decorate tombs and temples during the Eastern Han period (25–220 CE) also frequently depict people playing Liubo, sometimes as a small part of a complex scene depicting many different activities, but sometimes as the focal point of the scene, with the players attended by servants and playing in the cool of a pavilion. Some picture stones and engravings on stone coffins, especially those from the area of modern Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, show two winged immortals playing Liubo on a mountain, usually as part of a larger scene depicting the Queen Mother of the West and various mythical animals.

After the end of the Han dynasty the game seems to have lost its popularity, and there are no known examples of &quot;liubo&quot; funerary ware or depictions of &quot;liubo&quot; playing later than the Jin dynasty (266–420). Although the game is still occasionally referred to in some historical sources and in poetry as late as the Tang dynasty (618–907), it seems that &quot;liubo&quot; had been largely displaced by the game of Go. By the time of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) all knowledge of the game of &quot;liubo&quot; had been lost, and it is only with the archeological discoveries of recent years that the game has become better known.

There is some evidence that the game of &quot;liubo&quot; spread to beyond the confines of China. The &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; mentions that Tibetans enjoyed playing both the game of Go and &quot;liubo&quot;, but although ancient Tibetan Go boards have been discovered, no examples of Tibetan &quot;liubo&quot; boards are known. The Chinese version of the &quot;Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra&quot; also mentions the playing of several games, including &quot;Liubo&quot;, which some have taken as evidence that &quot;Liubo&quot; was transmitted to India. However, to date no examples of &quot;Liubo&quot; boards have been found outside of China.

==Equipment==

Liubo boards and game equipment are often found as grave goods in tombs from the Han dynasty. Various types and sizes of Liubo board have been unearthed, made from a variety of materials, including wood, lacquered wood, pottery, stone and bronze. Some of the boards are simple square slabs of stone or wood, but others are supported by knobs at the four corners, and some are built as tables with long legs. Regardless of their size or shape, the common feature of all Liubo boards is the distinctive pattern that is carved or painted on their surface:

All excavated boards have the angular V-shaped marks at the corners and L-shaped marks at the center of the edges, as well as the central square and T-shaped protrusions, and most boards also have four marks (usually circular but sometimes a decorative pattern) between the corner mark and the central square. However, on some boards each circular mark is replaced by a straight line joining the corner mark to the corner of the inner square, and in a few cases there is no mark between the corner and the square at all.

In many tombs only the Liubo board has survived (especially if made of stone or bronze), and it can be assumed that any associated game pieces have decayed, whereas in other cases the game pieces (which are often made of ivory) have survived but the Liubo board (which is often made of wood or lacquer) has rotted away. However, in 1973 a unique, complete set of Liubo equipment in a lacquer box was discovered in a 2nd-century BCE tomb at Mawangdui (believed to be that of the son of the Marquis of Dai). This Liubo set comprises the following items (the Chinese description of the items in the inventory of grave goods that was found in the tomb are given in brackets):
*1 lacquered wooden game box (45.0 × 45.0 × 17.0 cm.) [博一具]
*1 lacquered wooden game board (45.0 × 45.0 × 1.2 cm.) [博局一]
*12 cuboid ivory game pieces (4,2 × 2.2 × 2.3 cm.), six black and six white [象其十二]
*20 ivory game pieces (2.9 × 1.7 × 1.0 cm.) [象直食其廿]
*30 rod-shaped ivory counting chips (16.4 cm. long) [象筭三十枚]
*12 ivory throwing rods (22.7 cm. long) [象□□□□ (last four characters obliterated)]
*1 ivory knife (22.0 cm. long) [象割刀一]
*1 ivory scraper (17.2 cm. long) [象削一]
*1 eighteen-sided die with the numbers &quot;1&quot; through &quot;16&quot; and characters meaning &quot;win&quot; and &quot;lose&quot; [not listed in the inventory]
The six black and six white game pieces are the main game pieces to be moved around the board, and similar sets of cubic or cuboid game pieces made from ivory, jadeite or rock crystal have been found in several other tombs. In at least one case the game pieces are not distinguished by colour, but by having an engraving of a tiger on the pieces of one set and an engraving of a dragon on the pieces of the other set. One game piece on each side is designated as a commander.

The twelve long rods are two sets of the six throwing sticks that the players use to determine their moves, and which the game is named after (Liubo=&quot;six sticks&quot;). Most Han stone pictures of Liubo show the players throwing sticks onto a mat between themselves (with the Liubo board to the side of the mat), and ceramic model Liubo sets such as the one excavated in 1972 from Lingbao in Henan province show six sticks lined up neatly between the two players.

Sets of thirty rod-shaped counting chips have also been found in association with Liubo sets from other tombs.

However, the twenty ivory game pieces and the eighteen-sided die in the Mawangdui set are not typically associated with Liubo boards in other tombs, and it is possible that they were not used for playing Liubo, but were equipment for a different game. A similar eighteen-sided die with numbers &quot;1&quot; through &quot;16&quot;, &quot;win&quot; and &quot;take a drink&quot; was found in association with two sets of twenty copper, coin-shaped tokens (one set inscribed &quot;Number 1&quot; through &quot;Number 20&quot;, and the other set inscribed with three-character lines of poetry) in a Han tomb at Mancheng County in Hebei. No Liubo board or Liubo game pieces were found in the tomb, and because of the inscription &quot;take a drink&quot; (酒來) on one face of the die, the die and sets of tokens are supposed to have been used for a drinking game.

==Rules==

The exact rules of the game of Liubo are not known, and some of the surviving descriptions of the game are conflicting, which suggests that the game may have been played according to different rules at different times or in different places. The most complete description of the rules of Liubo occurs in a quotation from the lost &quot;Book of Ancient Bo&quot; (古博經) in a commentary by Zhang Zhan (張湛) to the &quot;Book of Liezi&quot; that was written during the Jin dynasty (266–420):
Method of play: Two people sit facing each other over a board, and the board is divided into twelve paths, with two ends, and an area called the &quot;water&quot; in the middle. Twelve game pieces are used, which according to the ancient rules are six white and six black. There are also two &quot;fish&quot; pieces, which are placed in the water. The throwing of the dice is done with a jade. The two players take turns to throw the dice and move their pieces. When a piece has been moved to a certain place it is stood up on end, and called an &quot;owl (梟or驍) &quot;. Thereupon it can enter the water and eat a fish, which is also called &quot;pulling a fish&quot;. Every time a player pulls a fish he gets two tokens, and if he pulls two fish in a row he gets three tokens [for the second fish]. If a player has already pulled two fish but does not win it is called double-pulling a pair of fish. When one player wins six tokens the game is won.
Another, somewhat later source, &quot;The Family Instructions of Master Yan&quot; by Yan Zhitui (531–591) states that there were two variants of Liubo, &quot;Greater Bo&quot; (大博) which was played with six throwing sticks, and &quot;Lesser Bo&quot; (小博) which was played with two dice:
The ancient Greater Bo used six sticks, whereas Lesser Bo used two dice. Nowadays there is no-one who knows how to play, but in those days when it was played it used one die and twelve game pieces. It had very little skill, and was not worth playing.
Most game historians think that Liubo was a race game, and that players moved their six games pieces around the marks on the board. However, others consider Liubo to have been a battle game played with dice or throwing sticks.

There have been several attempts to reconstruct the rules of the game, most notably by Lien-sheng Yang, who discusses the game as it was possibly played on TLV mirrors. Yang theorizes that a player&#x27;s piece would start on an L-shaped mark and try to move to a V-shaped corner mark depending on the throw of the sticks. Certain throws would allow a player&#x27;s piece to move into the center and ‘kill’ the opponent&#x27;s piece if it was already there. Once in the center, a piece could begin to block the enemy&#x27;s pieces from taking a square. For each block one would gain two points. One could also attempt to recover one&#x27;s pieces after they are blocked, and would gain three points for doing this. If one failed to win after having blocked two men, then the opponent would gain six points and win the game. The first player to six points would win the game. Jean-Louis Cazaux has reconstructed similar rules for playing Liubo. An implementation of these reconstructed rules as a playable computer game has also been attempted.

In 2019, more than 1000 bamboo slips containing the rules for Liubo have been discovered in the tomb of the Marquis of Haihun.

==Chupu==
A variant of Liubo in which dice were used to make the moves was called Chupu (樗蒲) or Wumu (五木). In Korea the traditional game of &quot;jeopo&quot; () is still played, on a board that is not similar to a Liubo board.

==Relationship to other games==
Some scholars associate Liubo to other board games, and in particular some Chinese scholars believe that Xiangqi (Chinese chess) was based on Liubo. Some historians believe that Xiangqi is not related to Persian chess, but was based on Liubo, whereas others have suggested that Liubo was transmitted from China to India during the Eastern Jin (317–420), where it developed into Chaturanga, which was the ancestor to both Persian chess and Chinese chess. Jean-Louis Cazaux has argued that Chinese chess could have been the result of hybridization between Indian or Persian chess and Liubo, which could have been transformed from a race game to a battle game. However, most game historians believe that Xiangqi originates from Indian or Persian chess and reject the claim that Xiangqi or other chess variants derive from Liubo. In a more recent publication, Cazaux opines that both the hypotheses of an Indian, Persian or Chinese origin of chess have some plausibility.

==Liubo patterns on other objects==

===Mirrors===

The pattern found on the surface of Liubo boards is also found on the most common type of Han dynasty bronze mirror, known from their distinctive markings as TLV mirrors. There is some debate over whether the Liubo pattern on these mirrors was simply decorative, or whether it had a ritual significance, or whether perhaps the mirrors doubled as portable Liubo game boards. Zhou Zheng has pointed out that one TLV mirror dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23) has an inscription that includes the words &quot;Carved with a Liubo board pattern to dispel misfortune&quot; (刻具博局去[祛]不羊[祥]), which suggests that the main purpose of the Liubo pattern on mirrors was ritual, and that the pattern had a special significance beyond game-playing.

===Coins===

The Liubo pattern is also sometimes found on the reverse of Wu Zhu coins. Such coins were not used as currency but were probably lucky charms.

===Sundials===

In 1897 a Han dynasty stone sundial was discovered in Inner Mongolia which had been overcarved with a Liubo board pattern. The only other complete Han dynasty sundial, in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum, also has a Liubo pattern carved on it. It may be that the sundials were repurposed as Liubo boards by carving the Liubo pattern over the original sundial markings, or it may be that the Liubo markings were added for some unknown ritual purpose.

===Divination boards===

In 1993, a wooden board with turtle divination diagrams and prognostications on one side and a Liubo diagram and forty-five prognostications on five topics on the other side was excavated from a late Western Han tomb at Yinwan in Donghai County, Jiangsu. The Liubo diagram is too small to have been used for playing Liubo, and is covered with the sixty terms of the sexagenary cycle which are written all along the lines of the Liubo diagram, in a similar way that the turtle diagram on the other side of the board is filled with the sixty terms. The prognostications under the Liubo diagram are headed with one of nine terms that correspond to the words of an enigmatic, mnemonic rhyme about Liubo written by Xu Bochang (許博昌) during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han (141–87 BCE); Lillian Tseng (Zeng Lanying) argues that these are the names for particular points on the board (the two lines of the &quot;V&quot; mark, the two lines of the &quot;L&quot; mark, the two lines of the &quot;T&quot; mark, the circle or line between the corner and the central square, the outside edge of the central square, and the inside of the central square).

Li Xueqin has suggested that the board was used for divination by matching the day to be divined to the corresponding sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram, and then reading off the corresponding prognostication according to the position of the sexagenary term on the Liubo diagram. However, Lillian Tseng points out that the divination could also be done the other way round, by looking for the desired prognostication (for example an auspicious marriage day), and then all the days on the Liubo board that were written on the position corresponding to the term heading the prognostication would match the desired prognostication.

It has been theorized that the placement of the sixty sexagenary terms on the points of the Liubo divination diagram indicate the possible positions for placing pieces when playing Liubo, and that the sequence of the terms across the divination diagram reflects the path to be followed around the board when playing the game (starting at the north-east corner and ending at the north side of the central square).

==Players==

People who have played Liubo include:
*King Mu of Zhou (reigned 977–922 BCE), who according to the apocryphal &quot;Travels of King Mu&quot; once played a game of Liubo with a hermit that lasted three days.
*Duke Min of Song (宋湣公), who in 682 BCE got into an argument with Nangong Wan 南宮萬 whilst playing Liubo with him, and was killed by Nangong Wan when he hit the duke with the Liubo board.
*King Anxi of Wei 魏安釐王 (reigned 277–243 BCE) and his half-brother Lord Xinling of Wei 信陵君 (died 243 BCE). Once when the two of them were playing Liubo a message came that the beacons on the northern border had been lit; King Anxi wanted to stop the game and discuss the situation with his ministers, but his brother told him not to worry as it was only the king of Zhao on a hunting trip, and so they continued playing. The king was worried and could not concentrate on the game, but after the game was over news came that it was indeed the king of Zhao out hunting.
*Jing Ke (died 227 BCE), the failed assassin of Qin Shi Huang, once had an argument with Lu Goujian (魯句踐) over a game of Liubo, and had to flee for his life.
*Emperor Jing of Han (reigned 156–141 BCE), who when he was crown prince became angry during a game of Liubo with the Prince of Wu, and threw the Liubo board at the prince, killing him (cf. Rebellion of the Seven States).
*Liang Ji (died 159), who according to his biography was fond of playing Liubo.
*Li Guangyan (761–826), a Uyghur general who was presented with a girl who was trained in the arts of &quot;song, dance, music and Liubo&quot;.
*Liu Min (895–954), a Shatuo Turk and founder of the Northern Han kingdom, liked to play Liubo and gambling games when he was young.

Confucius did not approve of Liubo. In the &quot;Analects&quot; he grudgingly allows that playing Liubo and Go is better than being idle, and according to the &quot;Kongzi Jiayu&quot; (&quot;Family Sayings of Confucius&quot;) he stated that he would not play the game as it promoted bad habits.
