<text>The Southern United States (sometimes Dixie, also referred to as the Southern States, the American South, the Southland, Dixieland, or simply the South) is one of the four census regions defined by the United States Census Bureau. It is between the Atlantic Ocean and the Western United States, with the Midwestern and Northeastern United States to its north and the Gulf of Mexico and Mexico to its south.

Historically, the South was defined as all states south of the 18th-century Mason–Dixon line, the Ohio River, and the 36°30′ parallel. Within the South are different subregions such as the Southeast, South Central, Upper South, and Deep South. Maryland, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and Northern Virginia have become more culturally, economically, and politically aligned in certain aspects with the Northeastern United States and are sometimes identified as part of the Northeast or Mid-Atlantic. The U.S. Census Bureau continues to define all four places as formally being in the South. To account for cultural variations across the region, some scholars have proposed definitions of the South that do not coincide neatly with state boundaries. The South does not precisely correspond to the entire geographic south of the United States, but primarily includes the south-central and southeastern states. For example, California, which is geographically in the southwestern part of the country, is not considered part of the South; however, the geographically southeastern state of Georgia is.

The South, being home to some of the most racially diverse areas in the United States, is known for having developed its own distinct culture, with different customs, fashion, architecture, musical styles, and cuisines, which have distinguished it in many ways from other areas of the United States. From 1860 to 1861, eleven Southern states (plus an additional two Southern states that were claimed and partially controlled) seceded from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America. Following the American Civil War, these states were subsequently added back to the Union. Sociological research indicates that Southern collective identity stems from political, historical, demographic, and cultural distinctiveness from the rest of the United States; however, this has declined since around the late 20th century, with many Southern areas becoming a melting pot of cultures and people. Ethnic groups in the South were the most diverse among American regions, and include strong European (especially English, Scots-Irish, Scottish, Irish, French, and Spanish), African, and Native American ancestries.

The politics and economy of the region were historically dominated by a small rural elite. The historical and cultural development of the South has been profoundly influenced by the institution of slave labor, especially in the Deep South and coastal plain areas, from the early 1600s to mid-1800s. This includes the presence of a large proportion of African Americans within the population, support for the doctrine of states&#x27; rights, and legacy of racism magnified by the Civil War and Reconstruction era (1865–1877). Following effects included thousands of lynchings (mostly from 1880 to 1930), a segregated system of separate schools and public facilities established from Jim Crow laws that remained until the 1960s, and the widespread use of poll taxes and other methods to deny black and poor people the ability to vote or hold office until the 1960s. Scholars have characterized pockets of the Southern United States as being authoritarian enclaves from Reconstruction until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

When looked at broadly, studies have shown that Southerners tend to be more conservative than most non-Southerners, with liberalism being mostly predominant in places with a Black majority or urban areas in the South. Although historically a Democratic stronghold, most states in the region have in recent decades come to favor Republicans, although both the Republican and Democratic Party are competitive in certain Southern swing states. The region contains almost all of the Bible Belt, an area of high Protestant church attendance, especially evangelical churches such as the Southern Baptist Convention. Historically, the South relied heavily on agriculture as its main economic base and was predominantly rural until after World War II. Since the 1940s, the region has become more economically diversified and metropolitan, helping attract both national and international migrants. In the 21st century, it is the fastest-growing region in the United States, with Houston being the region&#x27;s largest city.

==Geography==



The South is a diverse meteorological region with numerous climatic zones, including temperate, sub-tropical, tropical, and arid—though the South generally has a reputation as hot and humid, with long summers and short, mild winters. Most of the South—except for the areas of higher elevations and areas near the western, southern, and some northern fringes—falls in the humid subtropical climate zone. Crops grow readily in the South due to its climate consistently providing growing seasons of at least six months before the first frost. Some common environments include bayous and swamplands, the southern pine forests, the warm temperate montane forest of the Appalachians, the savannas of the southern Great Plains, and the subtropical jungle and maritime forests along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Unique flora include various species of magnolia, rhododendron, cane, palm, and oak, among others. Fauna of the region is also diverse, encompassing a plethora of amphibian species, reptiles such as the green anole, the venomous cottonmouth snake, and the American alligator, mammals like the American black bear, the swamp rabbit, and the nine-banded armadillo, and birds such as the roseate spoonbill and the extinct but symbolic carolina parakeet.

The question of how to define the boundaries and subregions of the South has long been the focus of research and debate. As defined by the United States Census Bureau, the Southern region of the United States includes sixteen states and the District of Columbia. As of 2010, an estimated 114,555,744 people, or thirty-seven percent of all U.S. residents, lived in the South, the nation&#x27;s most populous region. The Census Bureau defines three smaller divisions:
* The South Atlantic states: Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
* The East South Central states: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee.
* The West South Central states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas.

A survey conducted by social geographers in 2010 selected thirteen states as the cultural South: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. The Council of State Governments, an organization for communication and coordination between states, includes the same thirteen states as well as Texas and Missouri in its South regional office.

Other terms related to the South include:
* The Old South: Can mean either southern states that were among the Thirteen Colonies (Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina) or all southern slave states before 1860 (which also includes Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas).
* The New South: All southern states following the American Civil War, post–Reconstruction era.
* Southeastern United States: Usually includes the Carolinas, the Virginias, Tennessee, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida.
* Southern Appalachia: Mainly refers to areas situated in the southern Appalachian Mountains, namely Eastern Kentucky, East Tennessee, Western North Carolina, Western Maryland, West Virginia, Southwest Virginia, North Georgia and Northwestern South Carolina.
* Upper South: Usually includes Kentucky, Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and on rare occasions Missouri, Maryland and Delaware. When combined with the southern Appalachian Mountains, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;Greater Appalachia&quot; following Ulster Protestant migrations to the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries.
* Deep South: Various definitions, usually includes Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina.
* Border States: Includes Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia. These were southern slave states on or near the border of the Confederacy that did not secede or only partially seceded from the U.S. in the 1860s. Large numbers of residents who joined both the Union and Confederate armed forces. Kentucky and Missouri had Confederate state governments with the Confederate government of Missouri and the Confederate government of Kentucky. The Confederacy controlled more than half of Kentucky and the southern portion of Missouri early in the war but were in-exile after 1862 and were represented in the Confederate Congress and by stars on the Confederate battle flag. West Virginia formed in 1863, after the western region of Virginia broke away to protest the Old Dominion&#x27;s joining of the Confederacy, but residents of the new state were about evenly divided on supporting the Union or Confederacy.
* Dixie: Nickname applied to Southern U.S. region, various definitions include certain areas more than others, but most commonly associated with the eleven former Confederate States.
* Solid South: Electoral voting bloc largely controlled by the Democratic Party from 1877 to 1964, largely resulting from disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction era in the late 19th century. Disfranchisement effectively denied most of the black and sometimes poor white population from voting or holding public office during this time period.
* Gulf Coast: Includes Gulf coasts of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama.
* Tidewater: Low-lying Atlantic coastal plain regions of Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and North Carolina.
* Mid-South: Various definitions, includes states within the Census Bureau of the East and West South Central United States. In another informal definition, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi are included, with adjoining areas of other states.

Historically, the South was defined as all states south of the 18th-century Mason–Dixon line, the Ohio River, and the 36°30′ parallel. Newer definitions of the South today are harder to define, due to cultural and sub-regional differences throughout the region; however, definitions usually refer to states that are in the southeastern and south-central geographic regions of the United States.

Although not included in the Census definition, two U.S. territories located southeast of Florida (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) are sometimes included as part of the Southern United States. The Federal Aviation Administration includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as part of the South, as does the Agricultural Research Service and the U.S. National Park Service.

==History==
===Native American culture===
The first well-dated evidence of human occupation in the south United States occurs around 9500 BC with the appearance of the earliest documented Americans, who are now referred to as Paleo-Indians. Paleoindians were hunter-gatherers that roamed in bands and frequently hunted megafauna. Several cultural stages, such as Archaic (–1000 BC) and the Woodland ( – AD 1000), preceded what the Europeans found at the end of the 15th centurythe Mississippian culture.

The Mississippian culture was a complex, mound-building Native American culture that flourished in what is now the Southeastern United States from approximately 800 AD to 1500 AD. Natives had elaborate and lengthy trading routes connecting their main residential and ceremonial centers extending through the river valleys and from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. Some noted explorers who encountered and described the Mississippian culture, by then in decline, included Pánfilo de Narváez (1528), Hernando de Soto (1540), and Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville (1699).

Native American descendants of the mound-builders include Alabama, Apalachee, Caddo, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Houma, and Seminole peoples, all of whom still reside in the South.

Other peoples whose ancestral links to the Mississippian culture are less clear, but those who were in the region before the European incursion include the Catawba and the Powhatan.

===European colonization===
The arrival of European settlers caused a massive population decline in Native Americans, due to Europeans unknowingly spreading diseases that the natives had no immunities towards, numerous violent conflicts, and forcibly relocating them.

The predominant culture of the original Southern states was English. In the 17th century, most voluntary immigrants were of English origin and settled chiefly along the eastern coast but had pushed as far inland as the Appalachian Mountains by the 18th century. The majority of early English settlers were indentured servants, who gained freedom after working off their passage. The wealthier men, typically members of the English landed gentry, who paid their way received land grants known as headrights to encourage settlement.

The Spanish and French established settlements in Florida, Texas, and Louisiana. The Spanish settled Florida in the 16th century, reaching a peak in the late 17th century, but the population was small because the Spaniards were relatively uninterested in agriculture, and Florida had no mineral resources.

There were regional differences in the Southern colonies, with the three main regions of Tidewater, the Deep South, and Appalachia. The first region to be settled was Tidewater, containing the low-lying plains of southeast Virginia, northeastern North Carolina, southern Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay. The next region to be settled was the Deep South, beginning in Province of Carolina and later the Province of Georgia. The last region to be settled was Appalachia, also settled by the Scotch-Irish.

King Charles II of England granted the Charter of Carolina in 1663 for land south of the British Colony of Virginia and north of Spanish Florida. He granted the land to eight lords proprietor. Charles granted the land in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. The granted lands included all or part of the present-day U.S. states of North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.

In the British colonies, immigration began in 1607 and continued until the outbreak of the Revolution in 1775. Settlers cleared land, built houses and outbuildings, and on their own farms. The Southern rich owned large plantations that dominated export agriculture and used slaves. Many were involved in the labor-intensive cultivation of tobacco, the first cash crop of Virginia. Tobacco exhausted the soil quickly, requiring that farmers regularly clear new fields. They used old fields as pasture, and for crops such as corn wheat, or allowed them to grow into woodlots.

The Barbados Slave Code served as the basis for the slave codes adopted in the British American colonies, including Carolina, Georgia, and Antigua. In other colonies where the codes are not an exact copy, such as Virginia and Maryland, the influence of the Barbados Slave Code can be traced throughout various provisions.

In the mid-to-late-18th century, large groups of Ulster Scots (later called the Scotch-Irish) and people from the Anglo-Scottish border region immigrated and settled in the back country of Appalachia and the Piedmont. They were the largest group of non-English immigrants from the British Isles before the American Revolution. In the 1980 census, 34% of Southerners reported that they were of English ancestry; English was the largest reported European ancestry in every Southern state by a large margin.

The early colonists engaged in warfare, trade, and cultural exchanges. Those living in the backcountry were more likely to encounter Creek Indians, Cherokee, and Choctaws and other regional native groups.

The oldest university in the South, the College of William &amp; Mary, was founded in 1693 in Virginia; it pioneered in the teaching of political economy and educated future U.S. Presidents Jefferson, Monroe and Tyler, all from Virginia. Indeed, the entire region dominated politics in the First Party System era: for example, four of the first five presidentsWashington, Jefferson, Madison and Monroewere from Virginia. The two oldest public universities are also in the South: the University of North Carolina (1789) and the University of Georgia (1785).

===Instituting slavery===

Slavery was legal in all of the Thirteen Colonies prior to the American Revolution in 1776. Britain had slave island colonies in the Caribbean, including Jamaica, Barbados, Nevis, and Antigua, which provided a steady flow of profits from the slave labor that produced sugar. The Southern Colonies differed in that the proportion of their populations that were African American slaves was much higher than in the Middle Colonies and New England Colonies, as shown on the map.

According to Bertram Wyatt-Brown, &quot;Bondage was an answer to an economic need. The South was not founded to create slavery; slavery was recruited to perpetuate the South.&quot; The Barbados Slave Code of 1661 served as the basis for the slave codes adopted in the British American colonies of the Province of Carolina and the Province of Georgia. In other colonies where the slaves codes were not an exact copy, such as the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Maryland, the influence of the Barbados Slave Code can be traced throughout various provisions.

===American Revolution===

During the American Revolutionary War, the Southern colonies helped embrace the Patriot cause. Virginia would provide leaders such as commander-in-chief George Washington, and the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson.

In 1780 and 1781, the British largely halted reconquest of the northern states and concentrated on the south, where they were told there was a large Loyalist population ready to leap to arms once the royal forces arrived. The British took control of Savannah and Charleston, capturing a large American army in the process, and set up a network of bases inland. Although there were Loyalists within the Southern colonies, they were concentrated in larger coastal cities and were not great enough in number to overcome the revolutionaries. The British forces at the Battle of Monck&#x27;s Corner and the Battle of Lenud&#x27;s Ferry consisted entirely of Loyalists with the exception of the commanding officer (Banastre Tarleton). Both white and black Loyalists fought for the British at the Battle of Kemp&#x27;s Landing in Virginia. Led by Nathanael Greene and other generals, the Americans engaged in Fabian tactics designed to wear down the British invasion force and to neutralize its strong points one by one. There were numerous battles large and small, with each side claiming some victories.

By 1781, however, British General Cornwallis moved north to Virginia, where an approaching army forced him to fortify and await rescue by the British Navy. The British Navy did arrive, but so did a stronger French fleet, and Cornwallis was trapped. American and French armies, led by George Washington, forced Cornwallis to surrender his entire army in Yorktown, Virginia, in October 1781, effectively winning the North American part of the war.

The Revolution provided a shock to slavery in the South and other regions of the new country. Thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom, catalyzed by the British Governor Dunmore of Virginia&#x27;s promise of freedom for service. Many others were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the British Empire. Between 1770 and 1790, there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks – from 61% to 44% in South Carolina and from 45% to 36% in Georgia. In addition, some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the Revolution. They were moved by the principles of the Revolution, along with Quaker and Methodist preachers who worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves. Planters such as George Washington often freed slaves by their wills. In the Upper South, more than 10% of all blacks were free by 1810, a significant expansion from pre-war proportions of less than 1% free.

===Antebellum years===

Cotton became dominant in the lower South after 1800. After the invention of the cotton gin, short staple cotton could be grown more widely. This led to an explosion of cotton cultivation, especially in the frontier uplands of Georgia, Alabama and other parts of the Deep South, as well as riverfront areas of the Mississippi Delta. Migrants poured into those areas in the early decades of the 19th century, when county population figures rose and fell as swells of people kept moving west. The expansion of cotton cultivation required more slave labor, and the institution became even more deeply an integral part of the South&#x27;s economy.
With the opening up of frontier lands after the government forced most Native Americans to move west of the Mississippi, there was a major migration of both whites and blacks to those territories. From the 1820s through the 1850s, more than one million enslaved Africans were transported to the Deep South in forced migration, two-thirds of them by slave traders and the others by masters who moved there. Planters in the Upper South sold slaves in excess of their needs as they shifted from tobacco to mixed agriculture. Many enslaved families were broken up, as planters preferred mostly strong males for field work.

Two major political issues that festered in the first half of the 19th century caused political alignment along sectional lines, strengthened the identities of North and South as distinct regions with certain strongly opposed interests, and fed the arguments over states&#x27; rights that culminated in secession and the Civil War. One of these issues concerned the protective tariffs enacted to assist the growth of the manufacturing sector, primarily in the North. In 1832, in resistance to federal legislation increasing tariffs, South Carolina passed an ordinance of nullification, a procedure in which a state would, in effect, repeal a Federal law. Soon a naval flotilla was sent to Charleston harbor, and the threat of landing ground troops was used to compel the collection of tariffs. A compromise was reached by which the tariffs would be gradually reduced, but the underlying argument over states&#x27; rights continued to escalate in the following decades.
The second issue concerned slavery, primarily the question of whether slavery would be permitted in newly admitted states. The issue was initially finessed by political compromises designed to balance the number of &quot;free&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; states. The issue resurfaced in a more virulent form, however, around the time of the Mexican–American War, which raised the stakes by adding new territories primarily on the Southern side of the imaginary geographic divide. Congress opposed allowing slavery in these territories.

Before the Civil War, the number of immigrants arriving at Southern ports began to increase, although the North continued to receive the most immigrants. Huguenots were among the first settlers in Charleston, along with the largest number of Orthodox Jews outside of New York City. Numerous Irish immigrants settled in New Orleans, establishing a distinct ethnic enclave now known as the Irish Channel. Germans also went to New Orleans and its environs, resulting in a large area north of the city (along the Mississippi) becoming known as the German Coast. Still greater numbers immigrated to Texas (especially after 1848), where many bought land and were farmers. Many more German immigrants arrived in Texas after the Civil War, where they created the brewing industry in Houston and elsewhere, became grocers in numerous cities, and also established wide areas of farming.

By 1840, New Orleans was the wealthiest city in the country and the third largest in population. The success of the city was based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas of the South. Because of lack of investment, however, construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North. People relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation.

===Native American removal===

Between 1830 and 1850, Native Americans were removed from their home states in the South and Eastern United States and were sent to Oklahoma.

===Civil War===
By 1856, the South had lost control of Congress, and was no longer able to silence calls for an end to slaverywhich came mostly from the more populated, free states of the North. The Republican Party, founded in 1854, pledged to stop the spread of slavery beyond those states where it already existed. After Abraham Lincoln was elected the first Republican president in 1860, seven cotton states declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America before Lincoln was inaugurated. The United States government, both outgoing and incoming, refused to recognize the Confederacy, and when the new Confederate President Jefferson Davis ordered his troops to open fire on Fort Sumter in April 1861, war broke out. Only the state of Kentucky attempted to remain neutral, and it could only do so briefly. When Lincoln called for troops to suppress what he referred to as &quot;combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary&quot; judicial or martial means, four more states decided to secede and join the Confederacy (which then moved its capital to Richmond, Virginia). Although the Confederacy had large supplies of captured munitions and many volunteers, it was slower than the Union in dealing with the border states. While the Upland South border states of Kentucky, Missouri, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, as well as the District of Columbia, continued to permit slavery during the Civil War, they remained with the Union though Kentucky and Missouri both had rival Confederate governments that formed that were admitted and recognized by the Confederacy. Though early in the war, the Confederacy controlled more than half of Kentucky and the southern portion of Missouri. By March 1862, the Union largely controlled all the border state areas, had shut down all commercial traffic from all Confederate ports, had prevented European recognition of the Confederate government, and was poised to seize New Orleans. The rugged mountainous East Tennessee region attempted to rejoin the Union as a new state, having opposed secession and slavery compared to most of Tennessee.

In the four years of war 1861–65 the South was the primary battleground, with all but two of the major battles taking place on Southern soil. Union forces led numerous campaigns into the western Confederacy, controlling the border states in 1861, the Tennessee River, the Cumberland River and New Orleans in 1862, and the Mississippi River in 1863. In the East, however, the Confederate Army under Robert E. Lee beat off attack after attack in its defense of their capital at Richmond. But when Lee tried to move north, he was repulsed (and nearly captured) at Sharpsburg (1862) and Gettysburg (1863).
The Confederacy had the resources for a short war, but was unable to finance or supply a longer war. It reversed the traditional low-tariff policy of the South by imposing a new 15% tax on all imports from the Union. The Union blockade stopped most commerce from entering the South, and smugglers avoided the tax, so the Confederate tariff produced too little revenue to finance the war. Inflated currency was the solution, but that created distrust of the Richmond government. Because of low investment in railroads, the Southern transportation system depended primarily on river and coastal traffic by boat; both were shut down by the Union Navy. The small railroad system virtually collapsed, so that by 1864 internal travel was so difficult that the Confederate economy was crippled.

The Confederate cause was hopeless by the time Atlanta fell and William T. Sherman marched through Georgia in late 1864, but the rebels fought on until Lee&#x27;s army surrendered in April 1865. Once the Confederate forces surrendered, the region moved into the Reconstruction Era (1865–1877), in a partially successful attempt to rebuild the destroyed region and grant civil rights to freed slaves.

Southerners who were against the Confederate cause during the Civil War were known as Southern Unionists. They were also known as Union Loyalists or Lincoln&#x27;s Loyalists. Within the eleven Confederate states, states such as Tennessee (especially East Tennessee), Virginia (which included West Virginia at the time), and North Carolina were home to the largest populations of Unionists. Many areas of Southern Appalachia harbored pro-Union sentiment as well. As many as 100,000 men living in states under Confederate control would serve in the Union Army or pro-Union guerrilla groups. Although Southern Unionists came from all classes, most differed socially, culturally, and economically from the regions dominant pre-war planter class.

The South suffered more than the North overall, as the Union strategy of attrition warfare meant that Lee could not replace his casualties, and the total war waged by Sherman, Sheridan and other Union armies devastated the infrastructure and caused widespread poverty and distress. The Confederacy suffered military losses of 95,000 soldiers killed in action and 165,000 who died of disease, for a total of 260,000, out of a total white Southern population at the time of around 5.5 million. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6% in the North and about 18% in the South. Northern military deaths were greater than Southern military deaths in absolute numbers, but were two-thirds smaller in terms of proportion of the population affected.

===Reconstruction and Jim Crow era===
After the Civil War, the South was devastated in terms of infrastructure and economy. Because of states&#x27; reluctance to grant voting rights to freedmen, Congress instituted Reconstruction governments. It established military districts and governors to rule over the South until new governments could be established. Many white Southerners who had actively supported the Confederacy were temporarily disenfranchised. Rebuilding was difficult as people grappled with the effects of a new labor economy of a free market in the midst of a widespread agricultural depression. In addition, the limited infrastructure the South had was mostly destroyed by the war. At the same time, the North was rapidly industrializing. To avoid the social effects of the war, most of the Southern states initially passed black codes. During Reconstruction, these were mostly legally nullified by federal law and anti-Confederate legislatures, which existed for a short time during Reconstruction.

There were thousands of people on the move, as African Americans tried to reunite families separated by slave sales, and sometimes migrated for better opportunities in towns or other states. Other freed people moved from plantation areas to cities or towns for a chance to get different jobs. At the same time, whites returned from refuges to reclaim plantations or town dwellings. In some areas, many whites returned to the land to farm for a while. Some freedpeople left the South altogether for states such as Ohio and Indiana, and later, Kansas. Thousands of others joined the migration to new opportunities in the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta bottomlands, and Texas.
With passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (which outlawed slavery), the 14th Amendment (which granted full U.S. citizenship to African Americans) and the 15th Amendment (which extended the right to vote to African American males), African Americans in the South were made free citizens and were given the right to vote. Under Federal protection, white and black Republicans formed constitutional conventions and state governments. Among their accomplishments were creating the first public education systems in Southern states, and providing for welfare through orphanages, hospitals and similar institutions.

Northerners came south to participate in politics and business. Some were representatives of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau and other agencies of Reconstruction; some were humanitarians with the intent to help black people. Some were adventurers who hoped to benefit themselves by questionable methods. They were all condemned with the pejorative term of carpetbagger. Some Southerners would also take advantage of the disrupted environment and made money off various schemes, including bonds and financing for railroads. White Southerners who supported Reconstruction policies and efforts became known as scalawags.

Secret vigilante organizations such as the Ku Klux Klanan organization sworn to perpetuate white supremacyhad arisen quickly after the war&#x27;s end in the 1860s, and used lynching, physical attacks, house burnings and other forms of intimidation to keep African Americans from exercising their political rights. Although the first Klan was disrupted by prosecution by the Federal government in the early 1870s, other groups persisted. By the mid-to-late-1870s, some upper class Southerners created increasing resistance to the altered social structure. Paramilitary organizations such as the White League in Louisiana (1874), the Red Shirts in Mississippi (1875) and rifle clubs, all &quot;White Line&quot; organizations, used organized violence against Republicans, both black and white, to remove Republicans from political office, repress and bar black voting, and restore the Democratic Party to power. In 1876 white Democrats regained power in most of the state legislatures. They began to pass laws designed to strip African Americans and Poor Whites from the voter registration rolls. The success of late-19th century interracial coalitions in several states inspired a reaction among some white Democrats, who worked harder to prevent both groups from voting.

Despite discrimination, many blacks became property owners in areas that were still developing. For instance, 90% of the Mississippi&#x27;s bottomlands were still frontier and undeveloped after the war. By the end of the century, two-thirds of the farmers in Mississippi&#x27;s Delta bottomlands were black. They had cleared the land themselves and often made money in early years by selling off timber. Tens of thousands of migrants went to the Delta, both to work as laborers to clear timber for lumber companies, and many to develop their own farms. Nonetheless, the long agricultural depression, along with disenfranchisement and lack of access to credit, led to many blacks in the Delta losing their property by 1910 and becoming sharecroppers or landless workers over the following decade. More than two generations of free African Americans lost their stake in property.
Nearly all Southerners, black and white, suffered economically as a result of the Civil War. Within a few years cotton production and harvest was back to pre-war levels, but low prices through much of the 19th century hampered recovery. They encouraged immigration by Chinese and Italian laborers into the Mississippi Delta. While the first Chinese entered as indentured laborers from Cuba, the majority came in the early 20th century. Neither group stayed long at rural farm labor. The Chinese became merchants and established stores in small towns throughout the Delta, establishing a place between white and black.

Migrations continued in the late 19th and early 20th centuries among both blacks and whites. In the last two decades of the 19th century about 141,000 blacks left the South, and more after 1900, totaling a loss of 537,000. After that the movement increased in what became known as the Great Migration from 1910 to 1940, and the Second Great Migration through 1970. Even more whites left the South, some going to California for opportunities and others heading to Northern industrial cities after 1900. Between 1880 and 1910, the loss of whites totaled 1,243,000. Five million more left between 1940 and 1970.

From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states, along with Oklahoma upon statehood, passed disenfranchising constitutions or amendments that introduced voter registration barrierssuch as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy teststhat were hard for minorities to meet. Most African Americans, most Mexican Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites were disenfranchised, losing the vote for decades. In some states, grandfather clauses temporarily exempted white illiterates from literacy tests. The numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout the former Confederacy as a result. This can be seen via the feature &quot;Turnout in Presidential and Midterm Elections&quot; at the University of Texas&#x27; &quot;Politics: Barriers to Voting&quot;. Alabama, which had established universal white suffrage in 1819 when it became a state, also substantially reduced voting by poor whites. Democrat-controlled legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to segregate public facilities and services, including transportation.

While African Americans, poor whites and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the early 20th century, for decades Supreme Court decisions overturning such provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to restrict voting. Most blacks in the former Confederacy and Oklahoma could not vote until 1965, after passage of the Voting Rights Act and Federal enforcement to ensure people could register. Despite increases in the eligible voting population with the inclusion of women, blacks, and those eighteen and over throughout this period, turnout in ex-Confederate states remained below the national average throughout the 20th century. Not until the late 1960s did all American citizens regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership of the American Civil Rights Movement.

Historian William Chafe has explored the defensive techniques developed inside the African American community to avoid the worst features of Jim Crow as expressed in the legal system, unbalanced economic power, and intimidation and psychological pressure. Chafe says &quot;protective socialization by blacks themselves&quot; was created inside the community to accommodate white-imposed sanctions while subtly encouraging challenges to those sanctions. Known as &quot;walking the tightrope&quot;, such efforts at bringing about change were only slightly effective before the 1920s, but did build the foundation that younger African Americans deployed in their aggressive, large-scale activism during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.

===1880s through 1930s===

At the end of the 19th century, white Democrats in the South had created state constitutions that were hostile to industry and business development, with anti-industrial laws extensive from the time new constitutions were adopted in the 1890s. Banks were few and small; there was little access to credit. Traditional agriculture persisted across the region. Especially in Alabama and Florida, rural minorities held control in many state legislatures long after population had shifted to industrializing cities, and legislators resisted business and modernizing interests: Alabama refused to redistrict between 1901 and 1972, long after major population and economic shifts to cities. For decades Birmingham generated the majority of revenue for the state, for instance, but received little back in services or infrastructure.

In the late 19th century, Texas rapidly expanded its railroad network, creating a network of cities connected on a radial plan and linked to the port of Galveston. Strikes and labor unrest served as a reflection of increasing industry: &quot;in 1885 Texas ranked ninth among forty states in number of workers involved in strikes (4,000); for the six-year period it ranked fifteenth. Seventy-five of the one hundred strikes, chiefly interstate strikes of telegraphers and railway workers, occurred in the year 1886.&quot;

By 1890, Dallas became the largest city in Texas, and by 1900 it had a population of more than 42,000, which more than doubled to over 92,000 a decade later. Dallas was the harnessmaking capital of the world and a center of other manufacturing. As an example of its ambitions, in 1907 Dallas built the Praetorian Building, fifteen storeys tall and the first skyscraper west of the Mississippi, soon to be followed by other skyscrapers. Texas was transformed by a railroad network linking five important cities, among them Houston with its nearby port at Galveston, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and El Paso. Each exceeded fifty thousand in population by 1920, with the major cities having three times that population.

Business interests were ignored by the Southern Democrat ruling class. Nonetheless, major new industries started developing in cities such as Atlanta, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; and Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston, Texas. Growth began occurring at a geometric rate. Birmingham became a major steel producer and mining town, with major population growth in the early decades of the 20th century.

The first major oil well in the South was drilled at Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas, on the morning of January 10, 1901. Other oil fields were later discovered nearby in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting &quot;Oil Boom&quot; permanently transformed the economy of the West South Central states and produced the richest economic expansion after the Civil War.

In the early 20th century, invasion of the boll weevil devastated cotton crops in the South, producing an additional catalyst to African Americans&#x27; decisions to leave the South. From 1910 to 1970, more than 6.5 million African Americans left the South in the Great Migration to Northern and Western cities, defecting from persistent lynching, violence, segregation, poor education, and inability to vote. Black migration transformed many Northern and Western cities, creating new cultures and music. Many African Americans, like other groups, became industrial workers; others started their own businesses within the communities. Southern whites also migrated to industrial cities like Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, and Los Angeles, where they took jobs in the booming new auto and defense industry.
Later, the Southern economy was dealt additional blows by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the economy suffered significant reversals and millions were left unemployed. Beginning in 1934 and lasting until 1939, an ecological disaster of severe wind and drought caused an exodus from Texas and Arkansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle region, and the surrounding plains, in which over 500,000 Americans were homeless, hungry and jobless. Thousands would leave the region to seek economic opportunities along the West Coast.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted the South as the &quot;number one priority&quot; in terms of need of assistance during the Great Depression. His administration created programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to provide rural electrification and stimulate development. Locked into low-productivity agriculture, the region&#x27;s growth was slowed by limited industrial development, low levels of entrepreneurship, and the lack of capital investment.

===1940s through late 20th century===
World War II marked a time of dramatic change within the South from an economic standpoint, as new industries and military bases were developed by the federal government, providing much-needed capital and infrastructure in many regions. People from all parts of the US came to the South for military training and work in the region&#x27;s many bases and new industries. During and after the war millions of hard-scrabble farmers, both white and black, left agriculture for other occupations and urban jobs.

The United States began mobilizing for war in a major way in the spring of 1940. The warm weather of the South proved ideal for building 60% of the Army&#x27;s new training camps and nearly half the new airfields. In all, 40% of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example, in 1940 the small town of 1500 people in Starke, Florida, became the base of Camp Blanding. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers. Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4 billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5 billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built in Virginia, in Charleston, South Carolina, and along the Gulf Coast.

Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia. The most secret and expensive operation was at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where unlimited amounts of locally generated electricity were used to prepare uranium for the atom bomb. The number of production workers doubled during the war. Most training centers, factories and shipyards were closed in 1945, but not all, and the families that left hardscrabble farms remained to find jobs in the growing urban South. The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as George B. Tindall notes, the transformation was, &quot;The demonstration of industrial potential, new habits of mind, and a recognition that industrialization demanded community services.&quot;

Per capita income jumped 140% from 1940 to 1945, compared to 100% elsewhere in the United States. Southern income rose from 59% to 65%. Dewey Grantham says the war, &quot;brought an abrupt departure from the South&#x27;s economic backwardness, poverty, and distinctive rural life, as the region moved perceptively closer to the mainstream of national economic and social life.&quot; Since 1970, the proportion of the African American population living in the South stabilized and began slightly increasing.

Farming shifted from cotton and tobacco, to include cattle, rice, soybeans, corn, and other foods. Industrial growth increased in the 1960s and greatly accelerated into the 1980s and 1990s. Several large urban areas in Texas, Georgia, and Florida grew to over four million people. Rapid expansion in industries such as autos, telecommunications, textiles, technology, banking, and aviation gave some states in the South an industrial strength to rival large states elsewhere in the country. By the 2000 census, the South (along with the West) was leading the nation in population growth. With this growth, however, has come long commute times and air pollution problems in cities such as Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, and others that rely on sprawling development and highway networks.

===21st century===

In the 21st century, and especially after the 2010 midterm elections, the Republican Party has largely dominated the South, both at the state and federal levels. As of 2024, Republicans control both houses of the state legislatures of 10 out of the eleven former Confederate States, the sole exception being the Virginia General Assembly. However, there are still some Democratic statewide officeholders in the South, such as Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, North Carolina governor Josh Stein, Virginia&#x27;s U.S. Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Georgia&#x27;s U.S. Senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.

In 2019, Fortune 500 companies headquartered in Southern states included: Texas with 50, Virginia with 21, Florida with 18, Georgia with 17, North Carolina with 11, and Tennessee with 10. In 2022, Texas led the nation with the most Fortune 500 company headquarters with 53. This economic expansion has enabled parts of the South to report some of the lowest unemployment rates in the United States.

Even with certain southern states and areas doing well economically, many southern states and areas still have high poverty rates when compared to the U.S. nationally. In 2021, nine out of the ten states with the highest poverty rates were in the South. Also, in 2023 all five states with the lowest GDP per capita were in the South: Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas, Alabama, and South Carolina.

==Modern economy==
In the late 20th century, the South changed dramatically. It saw a boom in its service economy, manufacturing base, high technology industries, and the financial sector. Texas in particular witnessed dramatic growth and population change with the dominance of the energy industry and tourism industries, such as the Alamo Mission in San Antonio. Tourism in Florida and along the Gulf Coast also grew steadily throughout the last decades of the 20th century.

Numerous new automobile production plants have opened in the region, or are soon to open, such as Mercedes-Benz in Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Hyundai in Montgomery, Alabama; the BMW production plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina; Toyota plants in Georgetown, Kentucky, Blue Springs, Mississippi and San Antonio; the GM manufacturing plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee; a Honda factory in Lincoln, Alabama; the Nissan North American headquarters in Franklin, Tennessee, and factories in Smyrna, Tennessee and Canton, Mississippi; a Kia factory in West Point, Georgia; and the Volkswagen Chattanooga Assembly Plant in Tennessee.

The two largest research parks in the country are located in the South: Research Triangle Park in North Carolina (the world&#x27;s largest) and the Cummings Research Park in Huntsville, Alabama (the world&#x27;s fourth largest).

In medicine, the Texas Medical Center in Houston has achieved international recognition in education, research, and patient care, especially in the fields of heart disease, cancer, and rehabilitation. In 1994 the Texas Medical Center was the largest medical center in the world including fourteen hospitals, two medical schools, four colleges of nursing, and six university systems. The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center is consistently ranked the No. 1 cancer research and treatment center in the United States.

Many major banking corporations have headquarters in the region. Bank of America and Truist Financial are in Charlotte. Wachovia was headquartered there before its purchase by Wells Fargo. Regions Financial Corporation is in Birmingham, as is AmSouth Bancorporation, and previously BBVA Compass before its acquisition by PNC Financial Services. Atlanta is the district headquarters of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Many corporations are headquartered in Atlanta and its surrounding area, such as The Coca-Cola Company, Delta Air Lines, and The Home Depot, and also many cable television networks, such as the Turner Broadcasting System (CNN, TBS, TNT, Turner South, Cartoon Network) and The Weather Channel.

==Education==
Southern public schools in the past have ranked in the lower half of some national surveys. When allowance for race is considered, a 2007 US Government list of test scores often shows white fourth and eighth graders performing better than average for reading and math; while black fourth and eighth graders also performed better than average. This comparison does not hold across the board. Mississippi often scores lower than national averages, no matter how statistics are compared. Newer data from 2009 suggests that secondary school education in the South is on par nationally, with 72% of high schoolers graduating compared to 73% nationwide.

The Southern United States is home to some of the nation&#x27;s largest and most prominent public and private institutions of higher education. Notable public colleges and universities in the South include:


* University of Virginia

==Culture==


The predominant culture of the South is English, and has its origins with the settlement of the region by large groups of people particularly from parts of West Midlands, southwest England, and southeast England, such as Sussex, Shropshire, and the West Country who moved to the Tidewater and the eastern parts of the Deep South in the 17th and early 18th centuries. For example, the city of Birmingham, Alabama, is named after Birmingham, England in the West Midlands. Northern English, Scots lowlanders and Ulster-Scots (later called the Scotch-Irish) who settled in Appalachia and the Upland South in the mid to late 18th century, and the many African people who were brought to the American South as slaves. Their descendants, identified as Black or African American people, compose the United States&#x27; second-largest racial minority, accounting for 12.1% of the total population according to the 2000 census. Despite Jim Crow era outflow to the North, the majority of the black population remains concentrated in Southern states and has heavily contributed to the cultural blend of religion, food, art, and music &quot;(see spiritual, blues, jazz, R&amp;B, soul music, country music, zydeco, bluegrass and rock and roll)&quot; that characterizes Southern culture today.

Overall, the South has had lower housing values, lower household incomes, and lower cost of living than the rest of the United States. These factors, combined with the fact that Southerners have continued to maintain strong loyalty to family ties, has led some sociologists to label white Southerners an ethnic or quasi-ethnic group, though this interpretation has been subject to criticism on the grounds that proponents of the view do not satisfactorily indicate how Southerners meet the criteria of ethnicity. In previous censuses, the largest ancestry group identified by Southerners was English or mostly English, with 19,618,370 self-reporting &quot;English&quot; as an ancestry on the 1980 census, followed by 12,709,872 listing &quot;Irish&quot; and 11,054,127 &quot;Afro-American&quot;. Almost a third of all Americans who claim English ancestry can be found in the American South, and over a quarter of all Southerners claim English descent as well.

===Origins===
The Southern planter class originated from the early modern English landed gentry, who were aristocratic landowners but not peers or &quot;titled nobility&quot;. According to historian G. E. Mingay, the gentry were landowners whose wealth &quot;made possible a certain kind of education, a standard of comfort, and a degree of leisure and a common interest in ways of spending it&quot;. Leisure distinguished gentry from businessmen who gained their wealth through work. The gentry did not work; their income came largely from rents paid by tenant farmers living on their estates. The concept of Southern chivalry in the Antebellum South originated from the gentry rank of Gentleman, acting as a chivalric ideal of the white planter class supposedly descended from the knights and Cavaliers of the Medieval and colonial eras.

Several Southern states (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia) were among the British colonies that sent delegates to sign the Declaration of Independence and then fought against the government (Great Britain), along with the Middle and New England colonies, during the Revolutionary War. The basis for much of Southern culture derives from these states being among the original Thirteen Colonies, and from much of the population of the colonial South having ancestral links to colonists who emigrated west. Southern manners and customs reflect the relationship with England that was held by the early population.

In 1765, London philanthropist Dr. John Fothergill remarked on the cultural differences of the British American colonies southward from Maryland and those to the north, suggesting that the Southerners were marked by &quot;idleness and extravagance&quot;. Fothergill suggested that Southerners were more similar to the people of the Caribbean than to the colonies to the north. J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur&#x27;s 1782 &quot;Letters from an American Farmer&quot; described Charleston, South Carolina, slaveholders as having &quot;all that life affords most bewitching and pleasurable, without labour, without fatigue, hardly subjected to the trouble of wishing.&quot; He declared that although slavery had not yet been completely abolished in the Northern states, the lot of northern slaves was far &quot;different... in every respect.&quot; Crèvecœur sought to portray Southerners as stuck in the social, cultural and economic remnants of colonialism, in contrast to the Northerners whom he considered to be representative of the distinctive culture of the new nation. 

Early in United States history, the contrasting characteristics of Southern states were acknowledged in a discussion between Thomas Jefferson and François-Jean de Chastellux. Jefferson ascribed the Southerners&#x27; &quot;unsteady&quot;, &quot;generous&quot;, &quot;candid&quot; traits to their climate, while De Chastellux claimed that Southerners&#x27; &quot;indelible character which every nation acquires at the moment of its origin&quot; would &quot;always be aristocratic&quot; not only because of slavery but also &quot;vanity and sloth&quot;. A visiting French dignitary concurred in 1810 that American customs seemed &quot;entirely changed&quot; over the Potomac River, and that Southern society resembled those of the Caribbean.

===Religion===
The South has had a majority of its population adhering to evangelical Protestantism ever since the early 1800s as a result of the Second Great Awakening, The upper classes often stayed Episcopalian or Presbyterian. The First Great Awakening starting in the 1740s and the Second Great Awakening ending in the 1850s generated large numbers of Methodist and Baptist converts. These denominations remain the two main Christian confessions in the South. By 1900, the Southern Baptist Convention had become the largest Protestant denomination in the whole United States with its membership concentrated in rural areas of the South. Baptists are the most common religious group, followed by Methodists, Pentecostals and other denominations. Roman Catholics historically were concentrated in Maryland, Louisiana, and Hispanic areas such as South Texas and South Florida and along the Gulf Coast. The great majority of black Southerners are either Baptist or Methodist. Statistics show that Southern states have the highest religious attendance figures of any region in the United States, constituting the so-called Bible Belt. Pentecostalism has been strong across the South since the late 19th century.

===National and international influences===
Apart from its climate, the living experience in the South increasingly resembles the rest of the nation. The arrival of millions of Northerners and Westerners, mainly since the late 20th century, has reshaped the culture of major metropolitan areas and coastal areas.

While Hispanics have long been a major factor in Texas, millions more have arrived in other Southern states during the 1990s and early 2000s bringing values not rooted in local traditions. Historian Raymond Mohl emphasizes the role of NAFTA in lowering trade barriers and facilitating large-scale population movements. He adds other factors such as ongoing economic crisis in Mexico, new more liberal immigration policies in the United States, labor recruitment and smuggling, that have produced a major flow of Mexican and Hispanic migration to the southeast. That region&#x27;s low-wage, low-skill economy readily hired cheap, reliable, nonunion labor, without asking applicants too many questions about legal status. Richard J. Gonzales argues that the rise of La Raza (Mexican American community) in terms of numbers and influence in politics, education, and language and cultural rights will grow rapidly in Texas by 2030 when demographers predict Hispanics will outnumber Anglos in Texas. However thus far their political participation and the Latino vote have been low, so the potential political impact is much higher than the actual one thus far.

Scholars have suggested that collective identity and Southern distinctiveness are thus declining in the Deep South, particularly when defined against &quot;an earlier South that was somehow more authentic, real, more unified and distinct&quot;. On the other hand, Southerners have moved west in large numbers, especially to California and to the Midwest. Thus, journalist Michael Hirsh proposed that aspects of Southern culture have spread throughout a greater portion of the rest of the United States in a process termed &quot;Southernization&quot;.

==Ethnicity==

The South has the largest African American population by region. The South has largely remained a black and white region while the other regions of the US have received larger amounts of Hispanic and Asian immigrants. However, the Hispanic population has seen rapid growth in certain areas of the South, particularly in South Florida and South Texas. The Upland South is heavily white, with few African Americans in this subregion of the South. 

==Sports==
===American football===
American football is heavily considered the most popular team sport in most areas of the Southern United States.

The region is home to numerous decorated and historic college football programs, particularly in the Southeastern Conference (known as the &quot;SEC&quot;), Atlantic Coast Conference (known as the &quot;ACC&quot;), and the Big 12 Conference. The SEC, consisting almost entirely of teams based in Southern states, is widely considered to be the strongest league in contemporary college football and includes the Alabama Crimson Tide, the program with the most national championships in the sport&#x27;s modern history. The sport is also highly competitive and has a spectator following at the high school level, particularly in rural areas, where high school football games often serve as prominent community gatherings.

The first established professional American football team based in the South were the Washington Redskins, now called the Washington Commanders. They still retain a large following in most of Virginia and parts of Maryland. Later on, the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL) began to expand many teams in the Southern US during the 1960s, with franchises like the Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, Houston Oilers, Miami Dolphins, and the Dallas Cowboys. In later decades, NFL expansion into Southern states continued, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during the 1970s, along with the Carolina Panthers, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Baltimore Ravens during the 1990s. The Houston Oilers were eventually replaced by the Houston Texans, after the Oilers relocated to Nashville to become the Tennessee Titans.

===Baseball===

Baseball has been played in the Southern United States dating back to the mid-19th century. It was traditionally more popular than American football until the 1980s and still accounts for the largest annual attendance amongst sports played in the South. The first mention of a baseball team in Houston was on April 11, 1861. During the late 19th century and early 20th century games were common, especially once the professional leagues such as the Texas League, the Dixie League, and the Southern League were organized.

The short-lived Louisville Colonels were a part of the early National League and American Association, but ceased to exist in 1899. The first Southern Major League Baseball team after the Colonels appeared in 1962, when the Houston Colt .45s (known today as the Houston Astros) were enfranchised. Later, the Atlanta Braves came in 1966, followed by the Texas Rangers in 1972, and finally the Miami Marlins and Tampa Bay Rays in the 1990s.

College baseball appears to be more well attended in the South than elsewhere, as teams like Florida State, Arkansas, LSU, Virginia, Mississippi State, Ole Miss, South Carolina, Florida and Texas are commonly at the top of the NCAA&#x27;s attendance. The South generally produces very successful collegiate baseball teams with Virginia, Vanderbilt, LSU, South Carolina, Florida and Coastal Carolina winning recent College World Series Titles.

The following is a list of each MLB team in the Southern U.S. and the total fan attendance for 2019:
===Auto racing===

The Southern states are commonly associated with stock car racing and its most prominent competition level NASCAR, which is headquartered in Charlotte and Daytona Beach. The sport was developed in the South during the early 20th century, with stock car racing&#x27;s historic mecca being Daytona Beach, where cars initially raced on the wide, flat beachfront, before the construction of Daytona International Speedway. Though the sport has attained a following throughout the United States, a majority of NASCAR races continue to take place at Southern tracks.

===Basketball===
Basketball is very popular throughout the Southern United States as both a recreational and spectator sport, particularly in the states of Kentucky and North Carolina. Both states are home to several prominent college basketball programs, including the Kentucky Wildcats, Louisville Cardinals, Duke Blue Devils and North Carolina Tar Heels. Other southern teams, like the Florida Gators and Virginia Cavaliers have won national championships.

NBA teams based in the South include the San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Dallas Mavericks, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Hornets, Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic, Memphis Grizzlies, New Orleans Pelicans, and Miami Heat. The Spurs and Heat in particular have become prominent within the NBA, with eight championships won by the two between 1999 and 2014.

===Golf===
Golf is a popular recreational sport in most areas of the South, with the region&#x27;s warm climate allowing it to host many professional tournaments and numerous destination golf resorts, particularly in the state of Florida. The region is home to The Masters which is played at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, and has become one of the professional game&#x27;s most important tournaments. One of the four major championships in Hilton Head Island, in South Carolina, is also home to a prominent American golf tournament and has several high-quality courses.

===Soccer===
In recent decades association football, known in the South as in the rest of the United States as &quot;soccer&quot;, has become a popular sport at youth and collegiate levels throughout the region. The game has been historically widespread at the college level in the Atlantic coast states of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas; which contain many of the nation&#x27;s most successful college soccer programs. In particular, Virginia has won 7 NCAA National Championships, the third most of any school.

The establishment of Major League Soccer has led to professional soccer clubs in the Southern cities including FC Dallas, Houston Dynamo, D.C. United, Orlando City, Inter Miami, Nashville SC, Atlanta United, Austin FC and Charlotte FC. The current United States second division soccer league, the USL Championship, was initially geographically based in the coastal Southeast around clubs in Charleston, Richmond, Charlotte, Wilmington, Raleigh, Virginia Beach, and Atlanta.

===Major sports teams in the South===
The Southern region is home to numerous professional sports franchises in the &quot;Big Four&quot; leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB), with many championships collectively among them. Professional sports leagues such as the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Soccer (MLS), and National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), have team franchises in following cities/metropolitan areas of the region:

* Dallas-Fort Worth: Cowboys (NFL), Rangers (MLB), Mavericks (NBA), Stars (NHL), FC Dallas (MLS), Wings (WNBA)
* Washington, D.C.: Commanders (NFL), Nationals (MLB), Wizards (NBA), Capitals (NHL), United or the Eagles (MLS), Mystics (WNBA), Spirit (NWSL)
* Miami-Fort Lauderdale: Dolphins (NFL), Marlins (MLB), Heat (NBA), Panthers (NHL), Inter or the Herons (MLS)
* Houston: Texans (NFL), Astros (MLB), Rockets (NBA), Dynamo (MLS), Dash (NWSL)

* San Antonio: Spurs (NBA)
* Jacksonville: Jaguars (NFL)
* Oklahoma City: Thunder (NBA)
* Memphis: Grizzlies (NBA)
* Raleigh: Hurricanes (NHL)
* Austin: Austin FC (MLS)
* Cary, North Carolina: Courage (NWSL)
* Louisville, Kentucky: Racing (NWSL)

==Health==
The map on the right shows that life expectancy is lower overall in most Southern states compared to the rest of the country. Obesity rates, hypertension, and diabetes are higher relative to the rest of the nation.

A study reported that six Southern states have the worst incidence of sleep disturbances in the nation, attributing the disturbances to high rates of obesity and smoking. 

The South has a higher percentage of obese people and diabetics when compared to national regional averages. The region also has the largest number of people dying from stroke complications and the highest rates of cognitive decline. Life expectancy is lower and death rates are higher, when compared to national averages of other regions in the United States. This disparity reflects substantial divergence between the South and other regions since the middle of the 20th century.

The East South Central Census Division of the United States (made up of Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama) had the highest rate of inpatient hospital stays in 2012. The other divisions, West South Central (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana) and South Atlantic (West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) ranked seventh and fifth. The South had a significantly higher rate of hospital discharges in 2005 than other regions of the United States, but the rate had declined to be closer to the overall national rate by 2011.

For cancer causes, the South, particularly an axis from West Virginia through Texas, leads the nation in adult obesity, adult smoking, low exercise, low fruit consumption, low vegetable consumption, all known cancer risk factors, which matches a similar high risk axis in &quot;All Cancers Combined, Death Rates by State, 2011&quot; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The South is home to some of the nation&#x27;s largest academic health systems, including the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Duke University Health, University of Florida Health, UNC Medical Center, University of Miami Health, UT Health Science Center at Houston, Emory Healthcare, University of South Florida Health, and others.

==Politics==

In the first decades after Reconstruction in the 1880s and 1890s, white Democrats regained power in the state legislatures, and began to make voter registration more complicated, to reduce black voting. With a combination of intimidation, fraud and violence by paramilitary groups, they suppressed black voting and turned Republicans out of office. From 1890 to 1908, ten of eleven states ratified new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised most black voters and many poor white voters. This disenfranchisement persisted for six decades into the 20th century, depriving blacks and poor whites of all political representation. Because they could not vote, they could not sit on juries. They had no one to represent their interests, resulting in state legislatures consistently underfunding programs and services, such as schools, for blacks and poor whites. Scholars have characterized pockets of the Southern United States as being &quot;authoritarian enclaves&quot; from Reconstruction to the Civil Rights Act.

With the collapse of the Republican Party in nearly all parts of the South, the region became known as the &quot;Solid South&quot;, and the Democratic Party after 1900 moved to a system of primaries to select their candidates. Victory in a primary was tantamount to election. From the late 1870s to the 1960s, only rarely was a state or national Southern politician a Republican, outside from Southern Republican strongholds within the Appalachian mountain districts. Southern Republicans during this period would continue to control parts of the Appalachian Mountain areas and compete for power in the former Border States. Apart from a few states (such as the Byrd Machine in Virginia, the Crump Machine in Memphis), and a few other local organizations, the Democratic Party itself was very lightly organized. It managed primaries but party officials had little other role. To be successful a politician built his own network of friends, neighbors and allies. Reelection was the norm, and the result from 1910 to the late 20th century was that Southern Democrats in Congress had accumulated seniority, and automatically took the chairmanships of all committees. By the 1940s the Supreme Court began to find disenfranchisement measures like the &quot;grandfather clause&quot; and the white primary unconstitutional. Southern legislatures quickly passed other measures to keep blacks disenfranchised, even after suffrage was extended more widely to poor whites. Because white Democrats controlled all the Southern seats in the U.S. Congress, they had outsize power and could sidetrack or filibuster efforts to pass legislation they did not agree with.
Increasing support for civil rights legislation by the national Democratic Party beginning in 1948 caused segregationist Southern Democrats to nominate Strom Thurmond on a third-party &quot;Dixiecrat&quot; ticket in 1948. These Dixiecrats returned to the party by 1950, but Southern Democrats held off Republican inroads in the suburbs by arguing that only they could defend the region from the onslaught of northern liberals and the civil rights movement. In response to the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling of 1954, 101 Southern congressmen (19 senators, 82 House members of which 99 were Southern Democrats and 2 were Republicans) in 1956 denounced the Brown decisions as a &quot;clear abuse of judicial power [that] climaxes a trend in the federal judiciary undertaking to legislate in derogation of the authority of Congress and to encroach upon the reserved rights of the states and the people.&quot; The manifesto lauded, &quot;...those states which have declared the intention to resist enforced integration by any lawful means&quot;. It was signed by all Southern senators except Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, and Tennessee senators Albert Gore Sr. and Estes Kefauver. Virginia closed schools in Warren County, Prince Edward County, Charlottesville, and Norfolk rather than integrate, but no other state followed suit. Democratic governors Orval Faubus of Arkansas, Ross Barnett of Mississippi, John Connally of Texas, Lester Maddox of Georgia, and, especially, George Wallace of Alabama resisted integration and appealed to a rural and blue-collar electorate.
The northern Democrats&#x27; support of civil rights issues culminated when Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which ended legal segregation and provided federal enforcement of voting rights for blacks. In the presidential election of 1964, Barry Goldwater&#x27;s only electoral victories outside his home state of Arizona were in the states of the Deep South where few blacks could vote before the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Pockets of resistance to integration in public places broke out in violence during the 1960s by the shadowy Ku Klux Klan, which caused a backlash among moderates. Major resistance to school busing extended into the 1970s.

National Republicans such as Richard Nixon began to develop their Southern strategy to attract conservative white Southerners, especially the middle class and suburban voters, in addition to migrants from the North and traditional GOP pockets in Appalachia. The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native Southerners Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. Georgia was the last state to do so, with Sonny Perdue taking the governorship in 2002. In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.

===Decline of Southern liberalism during the 20th century===
Southern liberals were an essential part of the New Deal coalition – without them Roosevelt lacked majorities in Congress. Typical leaders were Lyndon B. Johnson in Texas, Jim Folsom and John Sparkman in Alabama, Claude Pepper in Florida, Earl Long and Hale Boggs in Louisiana, and Estes Kefauver in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers, and supported the nascent labor union movement. An essential condition for this north–south coalition was for northern liberals to ignore the problem of racism throughout the South and elsewhere in the country. After 1945, however, northern liberalsled especially by young Hubert Humphrey of Minnesotaincreasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democratsthe Dixiecratstook control of the state parties in half the region and ran Strom Thurmond for president against Truman. Thurmond carried only the Deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 and 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 southern congressmen and senators signed the Southern Manifesto denouncing forced desegregation. The labor movement in the South was divided, and lost its political influence. Southern liberals were in a quandary – most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism, others switched sides, and the rest continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated; historian Numan V. Bartley states, &quot;Indeed, the very word &#x27;liberal&#x27; gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium.&quot;

===Presidents from the South===

The South produced nine of the country&#x27;s first twelve Presidents, including the Virginia Dynasty. After Zachary Taylor won the presidential election of 1848, no Southern politician was elected president until Woodrow Wilson in 1912. Andrew Johnson (of Tennessee) who was vice president in 1865, became president after the death of Abraham Lincoln. 

Out of the last eleven U.S. presidents, seven have Southern region ties: Lyndon B. Johnson (of Texas; 1963–69), Jimmy Carter (of Georgia; 1977–81), George H. W. Bush (of Texas; 1989–93), Bill Clinton (of Arkansas; 1993–2001), George W. Bush (of Texas; 2001–2009), Donald Trump (of Florida; 2017-2021, 2025-present), and Joe Biden (of Delaware; 2021–2025). Johnson was a native of Texas, while Carter is from Georgia, and Clinton from Arkansas. While George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush began their political careers in Texas, they were both born in New England and have their ancestral roots in that region. Similarly, while Joe Biden was born in Pennsylvania, he grew up largely in Delaware (classified as a Southern state by the U.S. Census Bureau) and spent his entire political career there.

===Other politicians and political movements===
The South has produced various nationally known politicians and political movements. In 1948, a group of Democratic congressmen, led by Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, split from the Democrats in reaction to an anti-segregation speech given by Minneapolis mayor and future senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. They founded the States Rights Democratic or Dixiecrat Party. During that year&#x27;s presidential election, the party ran Thurmond as its candidate and he carried four Deep South states.

In the 1968 Presidential election, Alabama Governor George C. Wallace ran for president on the American Independent Party ticket. Wallace ran a &quot;law and order&quot; campaign similar to that of Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy of gaining electoral votes downplayed race issues and focused on culturally conservative values, such as family issues, patriotism, and cultural issues that appealed to Southern Baptists.

In the 1994 mid-term elections, another Southern politician, Newt Gingrich, led the Republican Revolution, ushering in twelve years of GOP control of the House. Gingrich became Speaker of the United States House of Representatives in 1995 and served until his resignation in 1999. The incumbent Speaker of the House, Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson, is also from the South. 

Except for Bob Dole from Kansas (1985–96) and John Thune from South Dakota (2025-present), nearly all the recent Republican Senate Leaders have all been Southerners: Howard Baker (1981–1985) of Tennessee, Trent Lott (1996–2003) of Mississippi, Bill Frist (2003–2006) of Tennessee, and Mitch McConnell (2007–2024) of Kentucky.

The Republican candidates for president have won the South in elections since 1972, except for 1976. The region is not, however, entirely monolithic, and every successful Democratic candidate has won at least 2 of the 11 former Confederate states. Barack Obama won Florida, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia in 2008 but did not repeat his victory in North Carolina during his 2012 reelection campaign. Joe Biden also performed well for a modern Democrat in the South, winning Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and Georgia, in the 2020 United States presidential election.

==Race relations==
===Native Americans===
Native Americans have lived in what is now termed the American South for nearly 12,000 years. More and more of their land was taken until they were defeated by settlers in a series of conflicts ending in the War of 1812 and the Seminole Wars, and most of the surviving population were removed west to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).

===Civil rights movement===

The South witnessed two major events in the lives of 20th century African Americans: the Great Migration and the American Civil Rights Movement. The Great Migration began during World War I, hitting its high point during World War II. During this migration, Black people left the South to find work in Northern factories and other sectors of the economy.

The migration also empowered the growing Civil Rights Movement. While the movement existed in all parts of the United States, its focus was against disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow laws in the South. Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the Montgomery bus boycott, the Mississippi Freedom Summer, the March on Selma, Alabama, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;. Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South. The Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in Birmingham includes the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute which details Birmingham&#x27;s role as the center of the Civil Rights Movement. The 16th Street Baptist Church served as a rallying point for coordinating and carrying out the Birmingham campaign as well as the adjacent Kelly Ingram Park. This park served as ground zero for the infamous children&#x27;s protest that eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; it has since been rededicated as a place of &quot;Revolution and Reconciliation&quot; and is now the setting of moving sculptures related to the battle for Civil Rights in the city. Both Kelly Ingram Park and the 16th Street Baptist Church are centerpieces of the Birmingham Civil Rights District. The Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue. Additionally, Ebenezer Baptist Church is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the King Center, the location of Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King&#x27;s gravesites.

===Racial integration===
During the 1950s and 1960s, the racial integration of all-white collegiate sports teams was high on the regional agenda. Involved in it were issues of racial equality, racism, and the alumni&#x27;s demand for the top players who it needed to win high-profile games. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) would take the lead. First, they started to schedule integrated teams from the North. The wake-up call came in 1966, when Don Haskins&#x27;s Texas Western College team with five black starters, upset the all-white University of Kentucky team to win the NCAA national basketball championship. That happened at a time when there were no black varsity basketball teams in either the Southeastern Conference or the Southwest Conference. Finally ACC schools, typically under pressure from boosters and civil rights groups, integrated their sports teams. With an alumni base that dominated local and state politics, society and business, the ACC flagship schools were successful in their endeavoras historian Pamela Grundy argues, they had learned how to win:
: The widespread admiration that athletic ability inspired would help transform athletic fields from grounds of symbolic play to forces for social change, places where a wide range of citizens could publicly and at times effectively challenge the assumptions that cast them as unworthy of full participation in U.S. society. While athletic successes would not rid society of prejudice or stereotypeblack athletes would continue to confront racial slurs...[minority star players demonstrated] the discipline, intelligence, and poise to contend for position or influence in every arena of national life.

===Congress ends segregation (1964) and guarantees voting rights (1965)===
The decisive action ending segregation came when Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, overcame Southern filibusters to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. A complex interaction of factors came together unexpectedly in the period from 1954 to 1965 to make the momentous changes possible. The Supreme Court had taken the first initiative in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) making segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Enforcement was rapid in the North and border states but was deliberately stopped in the South by the movement called Massive Resistance, sponsored by rural segregationists who largely controlled the state legislatures. Southern liberals, who counseled moderation, were shouted down by both sides and had limited impact. Much more significant was the Civil Rights Movement, especially the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) headed by Martin Luther King Jr. It largely displaced the old, much more moderate NAACP in taking leadership roles. King organized massive demonstrations, that seized massive media attention in an era when network television news was an innovative and universally watched phenomenon. SCLC, student activists and smaller local organizations staged demonstrations across the South. National attention focused on Birmingham, Alabama, where protesters deliberately provoked Bull Connor and his police forces by using young teenagers as demonstrators – and Connor arrested 900 in one day alone. The next day Connor unleashed billy clubs, police dogs, and high-pressure water hoses to disperse and punish the young demonstrators with a brutality that horrified the nation. It was very bad for business and the image of a modernizing progressive urban South. President John F. Kennedy, who had been calling for moderation, threatened to use federal troops to restore order in Birmingham. The result in Birmingham was a compromise by which the new mayor opened the library, golf courses, and other city facilities to both races, against the backdrop of church bombings and assassinations.

Confrontations continued to escalate. In the summer of 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, involving over 100,000 participants and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama in June 1963, Governor George Wallace escalated the crisis by defying court orders to admit the first two black students to the University of Alabama. Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation&#x27;s history. The Kennedy administration now gave full-fledged support to the civil rights movement, but powerful southern congressmen blocked any legislation. After Kennedy was assassinated President Lyndon Johnson called for immediate passage of Kennedy civil rights legislation as a memorial to the martyred president. Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader Everett Dirksen with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken, and the Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by a vote of 73 to 27. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits to desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the Civil Rights Commission; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore, racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner Lester Maddox in Georgia, who became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia followed the new law as the business community realized that peaceful integration was the only way forward.

Since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, black people have gone on to hold many offices within the Southern states. Black people have been elected or appointed as mayors or police chiefs in the cities of Atlanta, Baltimore, Birmingham, Charlotte, Columbia, Dover, Houston, Jackson, Jacksonville, Memphis, Montgomery, Nashville, New Orleans, Raleigh, Richmond, and Washington. They have also gone on to serve in both the U.S. Congress and state legislatures of Southern states.

===New Great Migration===

The Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s ended Jim Crow laws across the South and other areas of the United States. In recent decades, a second migration appears to be underway, this time with African Americans from the North moving to the South in record numbers. While race relations are still a contentious issue in the South and most of the U.S., the region surpasses the rest of the country in many areas of integration and racial equality. According to 2003 report by researchers at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, Virginia Beach, Charlotte, Nashville-Davidson, and Jacksonville were the five most integrated of the nation&#x27;s fifty largest cities, with Memphis at number six. Southern states tend to have a low disparity in incarceration rates between blacks and whites relative to the rest of the country.

The New Great Migration is not evenly distributed throughout the South. The rise in net gain points to Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, and Houston being a growing hot spots for the migrants of The New Great Migration. The percentage of Black Americans who live in the South has been increasing since 1990, and the biggest gains have been in the region&#x27;s large urban areas, according to census data. The Black population of metro Atlanta more than doubled between 1990 and 2020, surpassing 2 million in the most recent census. The Black population also more than doubled in metro Charlotte while Greater Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth both saw their Black populations surpass 1 million for the first time. Several smaller metro areas also saw sizable gains, including San Antonio; Raleigh and Greensboro, North Carolina; and Orlando. Primary destinations are states that have the most job opportunities, especially Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, Florida and Texas. Other southern states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Alabama and Arkansas, have seen little net growth in the African American population from return migration.

==Symbolism==
The Confederate battle flag is used as a symbol to identify the South, states&#x27; rights and Southern tradition.
Such groups as the League of the South have a high regard for the secession movement of 1860, citing a desire to protect and defend Southern heritage. Numerous political battles have erupted nationally and within the South over flying the Confederate flag over state capitols, and the naming of public buildings or highways after Confederate leaders, the prominence of certain statues and monuments, and the everyday display of Confederate insignia.

Other symbols of the South include the Bonnie Blue Flag, magnolia trees, and the song &quot;Dixie&quot;.

==Population centers==
The South was predominately rural up until the 1940s. Since the mid-20th century, the population has increasingly grown in urban and metropolitan areas. The following tables show the twenty largest cities, counties, metropolitan and combined statistical areas in the South. Houston is the largest city in the Southern United States.

<text>Morning View is the fourth studio album by American rock band Incubus, released October 22, 2001, through Epic Records. A companion DVD, &quot;The Morning View Sessions&quot;, was released on May 29, 2002. Continuing the move away from nu metal, the album ranges widely from soft to hard rock sounds in the style of alternative rock. &quot;Morning View&quot; was the last Incubus album to feature bassist Alex Katunich.

With the album producing the popular singles &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot;Morning View&quot; generally achieved critical praise and went double-platinum, making it the band&#x27;s highest selling album. A rerecorded version of the album, titled &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot;, was released on May 10, 2024.

==Background and recording==
To record the album, the band lived in Malibu, California, on a street called &quot;Morning View Drive&quot;. Former bassist Alex Katunich (aka &quot;Dirk Lance&quot;) noted that the band had previously &quot;tried to do that for at least the writing portion of &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, but we didn&#x27;t have enough clout at the time. When we were getting ready to write this one, we knew that we needed to get into a more creative place. The idea was to not feel as if you were driving [somewhere] to work on a record. You could just get up and it was a natural extension of your day.&quot;

Vocalist Brandon Boyd stated that the band &quot;needed quick access to the beach because we&#x27;re kinda spoiled brats sometimes. We need that outlet. At least I do. It&#x27;s nice to write music all day and be like, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to take a break, see you guys in two hours.&#x27;&quot; Katunich claimed that the album&#x27;s title came from the name of the street where it was recorded. Boyd notes that &quot;every time we&#x27;d pull into the street we had the view of the ocean and Pacific Coast Highway. I got a big creative boner every time I&#x27;d show up to the house. Every time we&#x27;d pull up, DJ Kilmore would be like, &#x27;Ah, Morning View. It&#x27;s time to rock!&#x27;&quot;

In a December 2001 interview, guitarist Mike Einziger talked about the decision to live and record in a house rather than in a conventional studio setting. He said, &quot;it defied every criticism from people at the record label and management. There were a lot of people who thought it was a recipe for disaster. But we wanted to create an ideal environment for us to write and record music in. We knew what our goal was going in.&quot;

&quot;Drive&quot;, the band&#x27;s final single from their prior album &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, was released in late 2000 and started gaining popularity by the time Incubus moved into the house to record &quot;Morning View&quot;. Boyd said in 2012, &quot;we were seeing fruits of our labor for the first time. But also everything that comes on the coat tails of new success; hence the fond memories as well as the challenging ones. I think perhaps that is one reason &quot;Morning View&quot; turned out the way that it did. It was unconsciously and consciously imbued with very real emotions, hopes, disappointments, and triumphs.&quot; Boyd had recently broken up with his girlfriend who he met during the recording of &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. Before meeting her he had just split from his previous girlfriend who was having an affair. He said in 2021, &quot;I was coming off the heels of two, really just heartbreaking separations, like one after the other. So I was coming into the recording of &quot;Morning View&quot; excited, elated, filled with enthusiasm, and heartbroken all at the same time. Looking back, I feel really lucky because I was able to experience those things through the lens of music and art.&quot; After a month at the house, the band finished recording the album in May 2001, with Einziger remembering in 2002 &quot;we were just on the verge of a musical orgasm after we finished &quot;Morning View&quot;. We felt like you&#x27;d feel after having the best sexual experience of your entire life. Exhausted, but extremely satisfied.&quot;

Out of the 30 songs the band sketched out for the album, 13 ended up on the final release. One of the unreleased songs called &quot;Anything&quot; was later released on the compilation album &quot;Monuments and Melodies&quot;. Other songs also added to Monuments and Melodies were &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;Are You In?&quot;, and &quot;Mexico&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, Brandon Boyd started attaining popularity among female listeners, and would begin to take his shirt off for them during concerts. He was labelled as &quot;MTV&#x27;s newest weapon of mass heartbreak&quot; and included on &quot;Teen People&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The Hottest Guys in Music&quot; in 2001. In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; shortly after the release of &quot;Morning View&quot;, it was noted that Boyd was &quot;always getting chased by girls&quot; as a child, before even forming Incubus. Around the making of the album, Mike Einziger also composed the rock and funk-based soundtrack for the comedy film &quot;Sol Goode&quot;, which was eventually released in early 2003. The film featured Jared Leto in a small role, with his band Thirty Seconds to Mars later touring with Incubus in 2002.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Morning View&quot; has been described as an alternative rock, alternative metal, hard rock and soft rock album and it features a variety of styles: ambience, aggression, and groove. It has an overall softer sound than previous albums, especially apparent on songs like &quot;11am&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Are You In?&quot;. The album also contains an acoustic ballad similar to &quot;Drive&quot; – &quot;Mexico&quot;, complete with strings. However, Incubus&#x27;s heavier side is still evident on tracks like &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever&quot; and &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot;. Mike Einziger stated in a 2001 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;there&#x27;s pressure to be a heavy band in this whole scene, and we just really turned our backs on it completely. I think the world of rap-metal is just pathetically ridiculous. In my opinion, it&#x27;s a very horrible place to be. We don&#x27;t want to be part of anyone&#x27;s little bullshit scene.&quot; Regarding the album&#x27;s sound, Einziger notes that it &quot;would&#x27;ve been really easy for us to try to replicate certain songs that did well on our last record, which we didn&#x27;t do. We didn&#x27;t do anything even remotely close to that. We put pressure on ourselves to make a good record because if none of us were happy with it, we&#x27;ll all be miserable for the next two years while we&#x27;re on tour.&quot;

The final song, &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;, employs the use of Chinese instruments such as the pipa and features a Japanese-style orchestra led by multi-instrumentalist Suzie Katayama. The pipa used on the recording was given to Mike Einziger from Steve Vai. Katayama later collaborated with Einziger on the experimental Time-Lapse Consortium project in 2003, and he credited her with inspiring his deepening musical comprehension. &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; is the longest song on the album at 7 minutes and 46 seconds long, with the last minute consisting of frogs croaking outside the house in Malibu. At the time, Boyd joked that the song was intended to make &quot;the listener pee in his/her pants&quot; from relaxation. He later claimed in 2021 that the song was influenced by the music of Björk, saying &quot;Mikey and I grew up kind of mutually obsessed with Björk’s music. There was so much we loved about it: the weirdness of it, the instrumentation, the arrangements, the choices that she was making and that the producers were making. So we were like, &#x27;let&#x27;s make a super Björky sounding breakbeat that’s really cool and eerie and mellow&#x27;.&quot; He adds, &quot;from there, I started messing around with the lyrics, and I remember when he started playing that little riff over that kind of trip-hop sounding beat, I just started singing: &#x27;I’m floating down a river&#x27;. That’s what it sounded like. To me, it sounded like we were on this psychedelic river cruise somewhere.&quot;

Many believed that the single &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; lyrically revolved around a failed relationship, although Boyd claimed in 2002 that this was not the case. Regarding the song&#x27;s meaning, he said, &quot;I had a moment in my life about a year ago where I was way too close to everything that was going on and I was blind. I felt like I was asleep. And the clouds parted for kind of a strange reason and I gained perspective. What happened was my hand had fallen asleep on the airplane on the way to Europe and it remained asleep for about 10 days, which was kind of scary. I must have pinched a nerve or something. But as my hand started waking up, the clouds started breaking away from that emotional state as well. The two happened simultaneously, so I created a simple metaphor for it. So it&#x27;s basically a song about gaining perspective on a situation.&quot;

==Touring and promotion==
&quot;Morning View&quot; boasted a total of four singles beginning with &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. The song was released on August 14, 2001, charting well and gaining significant rotation. The re-recorded version, &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot; has three singles: &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, and &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot;. In the original banned video for &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, Incubus are getting chased by a large pack of female fans, and eventually jump off a bridge. According to Boyd, the video was inspired by a scene in the 1968 film &quot;Head&quot;, which starred American band The Monkees. An alternative music video would end up being made for the song shortly afterwards, as the original version was deemed to be mirroring the September 11 attacks. The alternative version depicted the band playing in a studio against a white backdrop, interspersed with home movies they had made.

The follow up singles &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot; both gained substantial airplay as well. The video for &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; was shot on November 28, 2001 in
San Diego at the UCSD&#x27;s Rimac Arena. The final single &quot;Are You In?&quot; had a video exclusive to Europe due to its sensual nature and gained little attention compared to its predecessors.

Once they had finished recording their new album in 2001, Incubus began touring with Hundred Reasons in Europe from June until the first week of July. They were also invited to play Moby&#x27;s Area:One Festival alongside the likes of Outkast, The Roots, Paul Oakenfold, Carl Cox, and Nelly Furtado. In August, the band performed their first shows in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Amidst touring, Incubus was still experiencing commercial milestones for &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, and they continued to headline throughout the remainder of the year. They were one of the first bands to play in New York City following the September 11 attacks, with the event not affecting the band&#x27;s touring schedule. DJ Chris Kilmore told &quot;Billboard&quot; in November 2001, &quot;we’re taking the stand that we’re not going to let some idiot who just wants to kill everybody affect our lives. We’re just going to keep doing what we do, and hopefully, everything will be alright.&quot;

In January 2002, the band toured Europe with 311 and Hoobastank. Incubus played on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on February 14, 2002. For the remainder of February and March, the group performed throughout Australia, New Zealand and Japan again as part of their &quot;Pacific Tour&quot;, this time playing at a larger number of venues in these countries. While in Australia, they also shot the video for &quot;Warning&quot; in Sydney, and played on the &quot;Rove Live&quot; talk show in Melbourne for a second time, having earlier appeared on the program in 2001. They then returned to the US for their long-awaited Honda Civic Tour; joining their long-time friends from California, Hoobastank and Phantom Planet. These shows kept ticket prices low through sponsorship and saw the band give away cars to fans.

Incubus embarked on an American headlining tour on August 31, 2002, supported by Thirty Seconds to Mars. Their last concert during the &quot;Morning View&quot; touring cycle took place on November 2, 2002. The band took a break from touring and releasing music following this, and their next concerts would be at the Lollapalooza Festival in July 2003. Einziger told MTV in 2002, &quot;we kind of had a seamless transition from our last record to our newest record, and we think maybe that this time around we should disappear for a little while.&quot; Boyd added in the same interview, &quot;I think we&#x27;re all getting sick of ourselves, so we need to run away, but we&#x27;ll run away together &#x27;cause we can&#x27;t stay away from each other. Probably go and hang out in some place tropical, hopefully.&quot; Bassist Alex Katunich was asked to leave the band in October 2002, reportedly over personal and creative differences. His departure was announced to the media through a statement from Brandon Boyd in April 2003, with no official reason being given; He was replaced by Ben Kenney of the Roots.

On August 5, 2023, the band announced the release of &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot;, a complete rerecording of their 2001 album set for release on October 6 (subsequently postponed to 2024) by Virgin Music. Prior to the release of the album, Kenney departed from the band despite his recovery from cancer. Bassist Nicole Row (already touring in his place during his cancer treatment) was promoted to a full-time member, and played on &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot;.

==Commercial response==
Topping all previous Incubus records, &quot;Morning View&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at No. 2 with 266,000 copies sold in its first week. By December 2001, the album was certified platinum and still ranked No. 38 on the Top 200. Many of its singles would remain on the charts throughout the following year. After heavy touring and single rotation, &quot;Morning View&quot; would be the 40th best selling album of 2002.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The album received generally positive reviews, with a Metacritic score of 62, based on 10 reviews. &quot;Q&quot; stated that &quot;even at their most acerbic or delicately downplayed extremes, Incubus are compelling&quot;, while CDNow noted that Incubus &quot;has begun to grow up a bit&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in their November 2001 review, &quot;for a new-metal band competing in a field of alpha males with pierced, sloping brows, the supple, even delicate Incubus have an awful lot of yin in their yang. Unlike Staind, who require a suspension of disbelief that they are, essentially, macho crybabies, and Crazy Town, who probably tinge their mook-hop with Orientalism so they can score with Asian strippers, the coolest thing about Incubus is the way they come front-and-center with their inner little girl. They’ve got the tender lyrics, the nonlinear arrangements, melodies you can soak in and neckbreaker riffs alternating with swaying metallic grooves that somehow say, &#x27;Love me, OK?&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B in October 2001, and wrote, &quot;lead singer/heartthrob Brandon Boyd, with his wavy locks and herbal-life philosophy, is the anti-Fred Durst&quot;, further adding that &quot;Incubus’ nontraditional drift continues on &quot;Morning View&quot;, a third album that, with its sonic kitchen-sink approach to record making, feels more like a typical band’s experimental sixth album.&quot;

Sean Adams of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; awarded it a 9 out of 10 on November 21, 2001, writing, &quot;the really special bit, is the typical heart-throb frontman, Brandon Boyd. He&#x27;s got it made. His vocals are something special.&quot; Adams further writes, &quot;lyrically there is that little extra you don’t and won&#x27;t get from many, if any, of their peers. It may sound like self-empowered, dope smoking, hippy rubbish to some, but it&#x27;s gotta be better for the kidz than some homophobic diatribes, surely?.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Deren Svendsen awarded it a similarly high score of four-and-a-half out of five stars, noting, &quot;the ratio of softer and mellower numbers have increased dramatically, to the point where hardcore fans of earlier material may be bewildered. For the most part, the transition works.&quot; He adds, &quot;while it may not appeal to fans of the harder material, music lovers who like their rock a little less aggressive and a little more ambitious and, well, sensitive should give &quot;Morning View&quot; a spin.&quot; Dylan P. Gadino of &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; compared the album to Faith No More and Linkin Park in November 2001, still considering it to have the same metallic undertone of previous releases. He writes, &quot;on &quot;Morning View&quot;, the group&#x27;s third major label album, Boyd and company continue their journey into the metal mystic, guided by familiar cascading chord progressions and ethereal-to-plump dynamic sensibilities. There are aggressive rockers like &#x27;Under My Umbrella&#x27; here, but lush yet-harsh metal tunes like &#x27;Blood on the Ground&#x27; are more indicative of the album&#x27;s sound.&quot; However, he did note a higher number of acoustic songs, observing that, &quot;&quot;Morning View&quot; shows a softer Incubus, yet it also affirms the group as being visionary among today&#x27;s hard rockers.&quot;

&quot;Daily Nexus&quot; writer Jessica Jardine had a more negative view of the band&#x27;s new direction, remarking in November 2001, &quot;the release of the mushy-gushy single &#x27;Wish You Were Here&#x27; became an ominous harbinger of the kinder, fuzzier Incubus to come. Without skipping a beat, that’s just what &quot;Morning View&quot; delivers – into the waiting palms of pre-teen girls everywhere&quot;, adding that &quot;the semi-charged &#x27;Have You Ever&#x27; and &#x27;Under My Umbrella&#x27; remind me of &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; but lack the diaphragm-thrusting belts and off-beat experimentalism that once wooed me.&quot; She concluded her review by stating, &quot;yes, Brandon, you are a towering heartthrob amid booty-obsessed playa-pimps, but do we really need this saccharin-coated love goo?.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; had a similarly negative review in October 2001, writing, &quot;&quot;Morning View&quot;&#x27;s insurmountable flaw is that Incubus sell themselves as an intelligent and sensitive rock band, without actually appearing especially intelligent or sensitive. They&#x27;re hippies, basically.&quot; Mikael Wood of the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; wrote that &quot;Morning View&quot; is &quot;an unapologetically flowery record&quot;, adding that it &quot;wraps the angular, hard-edged funk-metal the band made in the early &#x27;90s in a silvery wash of acoustic-guitar strumming, vaguely Eastern ambience, SoCal surfer beatitude and Lilith Fair-friendly sensitive-male empathy.&quot;

===Legacy and accolades===
On March 1, 2003, Einziger, along with Scott Litt, Dave Holdredge, and Rick Will, were nominated for a Grammy in the &quot;Best Engineered Album (Non Classical)&quot; category, for their work on &quot;Morning View.&quot;

The 2003 book &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; reflected that it was the band&#x27;s &quot;most fully realized take on their artistic vision&quot;, and that &quot;the rock bits rock hard and the relaxed bits are quite gorgeous.&quot; Jim DeRogatis included it as an example of a modern psychedelic rock album in his 2003 book &quot;Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock&quot;, writing that Incubus took their sound &quot;to a new level with this effort, shedding its earlier Primus and Red Hot Chili Peppers obsessions and merging hard rock, ethnic percussion, DJ scratching, string sections, analog synthesizers and a dramatic use of dynamics.&quot;
In April 2002, Incubus were placed 29th on &quot;Spins &quot;Top 40 (Only Bands that Matter)&quot; list, with the publication reflecting that, &quot;over the past 11 years Incubus seamlessly evolved from funk metal dreadheads into a spiritual Sugar Ray that rocks.&quot; They add, &quot;the California-dreamy riffs and gentle beats of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Morning View&quot; gave modern rock radio an even fresher kick. Plus, lead singer Brandon Boyd&#x27;s perennially exposed abs (the group&#x27;s unofficial sixth member) inspired hordes of 12-year-old girls to discover what &#x27;Aqueous Transmission&#x27; means.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Morning View&quot; was ranked number 374 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it as the 17th best album of 2001, remarking &quot;as really, really, ridiculously good-looking as they were, Brandon Boyd and his Calabasas compatriots were more than just pretty faces.&quot; The publication placed &quot;Morning View&quot; first when ranking Incubus&#x27;s studio albums in 2020. In 2023, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; also placed it first in their ranking of the band&#x27;s discography, as did Brandon Boyd in a 2022 &quot;Louder Sound&quot; article.

On October 23, 2021, the band performed a 20th anniversary livestream concert at the same location in which the album was recorded. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the band had hoped to do a 20th anniversary tour for the album in 2021, following the success of their 20th anniversary tour for &quot;Make Yourself&quot; in 2019. On August 5, 2023, the band announced the release of &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot;, a complete rerecording of the album set for release on October 5 by Virgin Music. They simultaneously announced a concert at the Hollywood Bowl where they would perform &quot;Morning View&quot; in full, supported by Paris Jackson and Action Bronson, for the same day. Several days before the Hollywood Bowl concert, it was announced that the release of &quot;Morning View XXIII&quot; had been delayed to early 2024; the album was released on May 10, 2024.

<doc id="179561" wikidata="Q2904" url="?curid=179561" title="Herne, North Rhine-Westphalia">
<text>Herne () is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located in the Ruhr area directly between the cities of Bochum, and Gelsenkirchen.

== History ==

Herne (ancient Haranni) was a tiny village until the 19th century. When the mining of coal (and possibly ore) and the production of coke (the fuel processed from the harvested coal) and steel began, the villages of the Ruhr area had an influx of people, mostly from the east of Germany.

Herne is located on the direct axis between Bochum to the south and Recklinghausen to the north, with Münster in the north, Gelsenkirchen to the west, and Castrop-Rauxel and Dortmund to the east. The physical border between Herne and Recklinghausen is the bridge at the Bochumer Strasse across the Rhine–Herne Canal. A little further north of the canal flows the Emscher river, with the former abundance of wild horses that were caught in the Emscher Valley (Emschertal), then sold and/or traded at the yearly horse market at Crange, which later developed into the &quot;Cranger Kirmes&quot;. After World War II, Herne was known as &quot;Die Goldene Stadt&quot; (&quot;The Golden City&quot;) because of the comparatively limited damage suffered during World War II.

Present-day Herne includes the former settlements of Haranni, originating at the south end of the Bahnhofstrasse and just across the Evangelische Hauptkirche Herne (main Lutheran Church—seems to be called &quot;Kreuzkirche&quot; now) and the crossing of Sodingerstrasse, running to the east at that point, then turning into Wiescherstrasse; formerly independent settlements or villages like Baukau, Börnig, Crange, Horsthausen, Pöppinghausen, Sodingen, and others became the present Herne. These farms bearing these names were probably or possibly found in the 11th and 12th centuries. In 1860, the first of a number of coal mines started operating. In the following thirty years, the population increased twenty-fold. In 1975, Wanne-Eickel, by then a city with over 70,000 inhabitants, was incorporated into Herne, which had a population larger than &quot;Wanne-Eickel&quot; at that point in time.

=== World War II ===
Herne was targeted by the Royal Air Force on 4 June 1940, early in World War II, and air raids became daily and nightly occurrences. On one occasion, three high-explosive torpedo-bombs were dropped, severely damaging a number of houses in the Vincke-Strasse (only some of the outer shell had remained) and resulting in the deaths of all the inhabitants. Phosphorus bombs were dropped in several locations and caused fires that lasted for days. The canal was the major mode of transportation for coal and coke from the many coal mines in the area to the factories for iron ore to be processed into steel (Blau-Stahl), and coal was transported along the inter-connecting waterways in all other directions to be used for industrial as well as domestic use. In particular, the bridge across Rhine–Herne Canal, closest to the easternmost double-chambered lock and the wharf on the north shore, was hit and taken out.

The Krupp Treibstoffwerke oil refinery near the local Shamrock, ¾ of the coal mine, was bombed during the oil campaign of World War II.

<doc id="179565" wikidata="Q721700" url="?curid=179565" title="Augustin Barruel">
<text>Augustin Barruel (October 2, 1741 – October 5, 1820) was a French journalist, intellectual, and Jesuit priest. He is now mostly known for setting forth the conspiracy theory involving the Bavarian Illuminati and the Jacobins in his book &quot;Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism&quot; (original title &quot;Mémoires pour servir à l&#x27;Histoire du Jacobinisme&quot;) published in 1797. In short, Barruel wrote that the French Revolution was planned and executed by the secret societies.

==Biography==

Augustin Barruel was born at Villeneuve de Berg (Ardèche). He entered the Society of Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits, in 1756, and taught grammar at Toulouse from 1762. The storm against the Jesuits in France drove him from his country and he was occupied in college work in Moravia and Bohemia until the suppression of the order in 1773. He then returned to France and his first literary work appeared in 1774: &quot;Ode sur le glorieux avenement de Louis Auguste au trone&quot;. (Ode to the glorious advent to the throne of Louis Auguste). That same year he became a collaborator of the &quot;Année littéraire&quot;, edited by Fréron. His first important work was &quot;Les Helveiennes, ou Lettres Provinciales philosophiques&quot; (The Helveiennes or philosophical Provincial Letters) published in 1781.

In the meantime, national affairs in France were growing more and more turbulent, but Barruel continued his literary activity, which from now on occupied itself specially with public questions. In 1789 appeared &quot;Lettres sur le Divorce&quot;, a refutation of a book by Hennet. From 1788 to 1792 he edited the famous &quot;Journal Ecclesiastique&quot; founded by Joseph Dinouart in 1760. In this periodical was published Barruel&#x27;s &quot;La Conduite du. S. Siège envers la France&quot;, a vigorous defense of Pope Pius VI. He likewise wrote a number of pamphlets against the civil oath demanded from ecclesiastics and against the new civil constitution during 1790 and 1791. He afterward gathered into one &quot;Collection Ecclésiastique&quot; all of the works relative to the clergy and civil constitution.

==The French Revolution and the conspiracy theory==

Barruel, a Jesuit exiled from France, using some ideas plagiarized from John Robison, peddled a conspiracy theory that Jews, Freemasons and Illuminati want to demolish all monarchies plus the Vatican, in order to establish a World Republic. But Barruel did not accuse all Freemasons, and considered himself to be a Freemason. Barruel accused the Knight Templars that they secretly survived and they have infiltrated Freemasonry in order to destroy Christianity.

Barruel&#x27;s original idea was to depict Jews as engaged in a global conspiracy, a driving force of world history (till then the general consensus was that the Jews are too powerless to do that). Later, Barruel refrained from republishing his book &quot;fearing that it would lead to a massacre of the Jews.&quot;

The storm of the French Revolution had in the meantime forced Barruel to seek refuge in England, where he became almoner to the refugee Prince of Conti. Here he wrote in 1793 the &quot;Histoire du Clergé pendant la Revolution Française&quot; (&quot;History of the Clergy during the French Revolution&quot;). He dedicated the work to the English nation in recognition of the hospitality that it had showed toward the unfortunate French ecclesiastics. It has been translated into German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, and English. The English version went through several editions and did much to strengthen the British nation in its opposition to French revolutionary principles. While in London, Barruel published an English work, &quot;A Dissertation on Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction in the Catholic Church.&quot; But none of his works attracted so much attention as his &quot;Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism.&quot;

His basic idea was that of a conspiracy with the aim of overthrowing Christianity—or more to the point, any and all forms of political and social organization based on conformity to the moral teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. Barruel&#x27;s conspiracy is notable for suggesting an association between the Occult, the French Enlightenment, and Freemasons. He thereby associated Paganism with Enlightenment thought, a trend followed by some later reactionary thinkers and even contemporary intellectual historians.

It inspired John Robison, who had been working independently on his own conspiracy theory, to extend his book &quot;Proofs of a Conspiracy Against all the Religions and Governments of Europe&quot; and include several quotations from Barruel. Barruel and Robison were friends.

==Late years==

On the fall of the Directory in 1799, Barruel was enabled to return to France. He fully accepted and persuaded many other clergymen to accept the new political order of things in his native country and he wrote several books to defend his opinions. When the Concordat was made in 1801 between Pius VII and Napoleon, Barruel wrote: &quot;Du Pape et de ses Droits Religieux.&quot; 

In 1806, he was the recipient of the Simonini letter, which claimed to document a conspiracy among the Jews of Florence, Italy in coalition with the Illuminati. Barruel never published the letter&#x27;s contents openly, although he likely circulated copies privately and the letter ended up being published in France&#x27;s Le Contemporain in the 1870&#x27;s.

His last important controversy was his defense of the Holy See in its deposition of the French bishops, which he said had been necessitated by the new order of things in France established by the Concordat of 1801. His book appeared also in English: &quot;The Papal Power, or an historical essay on the temporal power of the Pope.&quot; Many attacked the work, but as usual, the author did not suffer an antagonist to go unanswered. His new work involved him in a very extended controversy, for his work was translated into all the principal European languages. His friends and foes alike became involved in a wordy war. Blanchard published in London no fewer than three refutations. He had promised to compose two works that never appeared: &quot;Historie des Sociétés Secrètes au Moyen-Age&quot; and &quot;Dissertation sur la Croisade contre les Albigeois&quot;. In regard to the latter work, Barruel stated his object would be to defend the Church against the reproach of having deposed kings and having freed their subjects from the oath of allegiance. He contended that objections on this score arose only from an ignorance of history. At the time of his death, Barruel was engaged on a refutation of the philosophical system of Immanuel Kant, but never completed his work. He died in Paris in 1820.

<text>The Southwestern United States, also known as the American Southwest or simply the Southwest, is a geographic and cultural region of the United States that includes Arizona and New Mexico, along with adjacent portions of California, Colorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. The largest cities by metropolitan area are Phoenix, Las Vegas, El Paso, Albuquerque, and Tucson. Before 1848, in the historical region of Santa Fe de Nuevo México as well as parts of Alta California and Coahuila y Tejas, settlement was almost non-existent outside of Nuevo México&#x27;s pueblos and Spanish or Mexican municipalities. Much of the area had been a part of New Spain and Mexico until the United States acquired the area through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 and the smaller Gadsden Purchase in 1854.

While the region&#x27;s boundaries are not officially defined, there have been attempts to do so. One such definition is from the Mojave Desert in California in the west (117° west longitude) to Carlsbad, New Mexico, in the east (104° west longitude); another says that it extends from the Mexico–United States border in the south to the southern areas of Colorado, Utah, and Nevada in the north (39° north latitude). In another definition, the core Southwestern U.S. includes only the states of Arizona and New Mexico; others focus on the land within the old Spanish and Mexican borders of the &quot;Nuevo México&quot; Province or the later American New Mexico Territory.

Distinct elements of the Western lifestyle thrive in the region, such as Western wear and Southwestern cuisines, including Native American, New Mexican, and Tex-Mex, or various genres of Western music like Indigenous, New Mexico, and Tejano music styles. Likewise with the sought-after Southwestern architectural styles in the region inspired by blending Pueblo and Territorial styles, with Mediterranean Revival, Spanish Colonial architecture, Mission Revival architecture, Pueblo Deco, and Ranch-style houses in the form of the amalgamated Pueblo Revival and Territorial Revival architectures. This is due to the region&#x27;s &quot;caballero&quot; heritage of the Native American (especially Apache, Pueblo, and Navajo), Hispano, Mexican American, and frontier cowboy.

==Regional geography==

The geography of the region is mainly made up of four features: the Mojave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan Deserts, and the Colorado Plateau; although there are other geographical features as well, such as a portion of the Great Basin Desert. The deserts dominate the southern and western reaches of the area, while the plateau (which is largely made up of high desert) is the main feature north of the Mogollon Rim. The two major rivers of the region are the Colorado River, running in the northern and western areas, and the Rio Grande, running in the east, north to south.

Formed approximately 8000 years ago, the Chihuahuan Desert is a relatively dry desert, although it is slightly wetter than the Sonoran Desert to the west. The Chihuahuan Desert spreads across the southeastern portion of the region, covering from southeastern Arizona, across southern and central New Mexico, and the portion of western Texas included in the Southwest. While it is the second largest desert in the United States, only a third of the desert is within the United States, with the rest in Mexico. El Paso and Albuquerque are the major US cities in this desert, with other smaller cities being Las Cruces and Roswell in New Mexico and Willcox in Arizona.

The elevation in the Chihuahuan Desert varies from about , as well as several larger mountain ranges within or bordering this desert including the Black Range, Organ Mountains, Capitan Mountains, Manzano Mountains, Sacramento Mountains]], Sandia Mountains, Magdalena Mountains, and Chiracahua Mountains, plus many smaller mountain ranges contained in the area, namely the Animas, San Andres, Guadalupe Mountains, and Doña Ana Mountains in New Mexico; and the Franklin, Hueco, and Davis Mountains in Texas. It also reaches up into the foothills of the higher ranges such as the Black Range and Oscura Mountains in New Mexico. High above the desert, these forest-covered and sometimes snow-capped mountains form sky islands, with radically different flora and fauna than the surrounding desert below. The sky islands also supply the surrounding desert foothills with flowing water during the spring runoff and after the summer storms of the New Mexican monsoon season. The Chihuahuan is a &quot;rain shadow&quot; desert, formed between two mountain ranges (the Sierra Madre Occidental on the west and the Sierra Madre Oriental on the east) which block oceanic precipitation from reaching the area. The Chihuahuan Desert is considered the &quot;most biologically diverse desert in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most diverse in the world,&quot; and includes more species of cacti than any other desert in the world. The most prolific plants in this region are agave, yucca and creosote bushes, in addition to the ubiquitous presence of various cacti species.
When people think of the desert southwest, the landscape of the Sonoran Desert is what mostly comes to mind. The Sonoran Desert makes up the southwestern portion of the Southwest; most of the desert lies in Mexico, but its United States component lies on the southeastern border of California, and the western 2/3 of southern Arizona. Rainfall averages between per year, and the desert&#x27;s most widely known inhabitant is the saguaro cactus, which is unique to the desert. It is bounded on the northwest by the Mojave Desert, to the north by the Colorado Plateau and to the east by the Arizona Mountains forests and the Chihuahuan Desert. Aside from the trademark saguaro, the desert has the most diverse plant life of any desert in the world, and includes many other species of cacti, including the organ-pipe, senita, prickly pear, barrel, fishhook, hedgehog, cholla, silver dollar, and jojoba. The portion of the Sonora Desert which lies in the Southwestern United States is the most populated area within the region. Six of the top ten major population centers of the region are found within its borders: Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Glendale, and Scottsdale, all in Arizona. Also within its borders are Yuma and Prescott, Arizona.

The most northwest portion of the American Southwest is covered by the Mojave Desert. Bordered on the south by the Sonoran Desert and the east by the Colorado Plateau, its range within the region makes up the southeast tip of Nevada, the southwestern corner of Utah and the northwestern corner of Arizona. In terms of topography, the Mojave is very similar to the Great Basin Desert, which lies just to its north. Within the region, Las Vegas is the most populous city; other significant population centers include Laughlin and Pahrump in Nevada, St. George and Hurricane in Utah, and Lake Havasu City, Kingman, and Bullhead City in Arizona. The Mojave is the smallest, driest and hottest desert within the United States. The Mojave gets less than of rain annually, and its elevation ranges from above sea level. The most prolific vegetation is the tall Joshua tree, which grow as tall as , and are thought to live almost 1000 years. Other major vegetation includes the Parry saltbush and the Mojave sage, both only found in the Mojave, as well as the creosote bush.
The Colorado Plateau varies from the large stands of forests in the west, including the largest stand of ponderosa pine trees in the world, to the Mesas to the east. Although not called a desert, the Colorado Plateau is mostly made up of high desert. Within the Southwest U.S. region, the Colorado is bordered to the south by the Mogollon Rim and the Sonoran Desert, to the west by the Mojave Desert, and to the east by the Rocky Mountains, the Rio Grande Rift valley, and the Llano Estacado. The Plateau is characterized by a series of plateaus and mesas, interspersed with canyons. The most dramatic example is the Grand Canyon. But that is one of many dramatic vistas included within the Plateau, which includes spectacular lava formations, &quot;painted&quot; deserts, sand dunes, and badlands. One of the most distinctive features of the Plateau is its longevity, having come into existence at least 500 million years ago. The Plateau can be divided into six sections, three of which fall into the Southwest region. Beginning with the Navajo section forming the northern boundary of the Southwestern United States, which has shallower canyons than those in the Canyonlands section just to its north; the Navajo section is bordered to the south by the Grand Canyon section, which of course is dominated by the Grand Canyon; and the southeasternmost portion of the Plateau is the Datil section, consisting of valleys, mesas, and volcanic formations. Albuquerque is the most populous city often considered at the edge of this portion contained in the Southwest region, but Santa Fe, New Mexico and Flagstaff, Arizona, are also significant population centers.
Phoenix, Tucson, and Las Vegas dominate the westernmost metropolitan areas in the Southwest, while Albuquerque-Santa Fe and El Paso-Las Cruces dominate the easternmost metropolitan areas.

==History==

===Pre-European contact===
Human history in the Southwest begins with the arrival of the Clovis culture, a Paleo-Indian hunter-gatherer culture which arrived sometime around 9000 BC. This culture remained in the area for several millennia. At some point they were replaced by three great Pre-Columbian Indian cultures: the Ancestral Pueblo people, the Hohokam, and the Mogollon, all of which existed among other surrounding cultures including the Patayan. Maize began to be cultivated in the region sometime during the early first millennium BC, but it took several hundred years for the native cultures to be dependent on it as a food source. As their dependence on maize grew, Pre-Columbian Indians began developing irrigation systems around 600 CE.

According to archeological finds, the Ancestral Pueblo people, also known as the &quot;Anasazi&quot; (although that term is viewed by modern Pueblo people as derogatory and is becoming more and more disused), began settling in the area in approximately 1500 BC. Eventually, they would spread throughout the entire northern section of the Southwest. This culture would go through several different eras lasting from approximately 1500 BC through the middle of the 15th century AD: the Basketmaker I, II, and III phases followed by the Pueblo I, II, III, and IV. As the Puebloans transitioned from a nomadic lifestyle to one based on both dry land and irrigated agriculture, their first domiciles were pithouses. The Mogollon culture developed later than the Puebloan, arising in the eastern area of the region at around 300 BC. Their range would eventually extend deep into what would become Mexico, and dominate the southeastern portion of the Southwest. Their settlements would evolve over time from pit-dwellings through pueblos and finally also incorporating cliff-dwellings. The Hohokam were the last of these ancestral cultures to develop, somewhere around AD 1, but they would grow to be the most populous of the three by AD 1300, despite being the smallest of the three in terms of area, covering most of the southwest portion. Beginning in approximately AD 600, the Hohokam began to develop an extensive series of irrigation canals; of the three major cultures in the Southwest, only the Ancestral Puebloans of the Chaco culture and the Hohokam developed irrigation as a means of watering their agriculture.

Not long after the Hohokam reached the height of their culture, all three major cultures in the Southwest began to decline for unknown reasons, although severe drought and encroachment from other peoples have been postulated. By the end of the 15th century, all three cultures had disappeared. The modern Puebloan tribes of the Isleta, Sandia, Cochiti, Kewa, Santa Ana, Taos, Jemez, Acoma, Laguna, and Zia, as well as the Hopi and Zuni peoples, trace their ancestry back to the Ancestral Puebloans, while the Akimel O&#x27;odham and Tohono O&#x27;odham claim descent from Hohokam. The area previously occupied by the Mogollon was taken over by an unrelated tribe, the Apache. While it is unclear whether any of the modern Indian tribes are descended from the Mogollon, some archeologists and historians believe that they mixed with Ancestral Puebloans and became part of the modern Hopi and Zuni tribes.
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the Southwestern United States was inhabited by a very large population of American Indian tribes. The area once occupied by the ancestral Puebloans became inhabited by several American Indian tribes, the most populous of which were the Navajo, Ute, Southern Paiute, and Hopi. The Navajo, along with the Hopi, were the earliest of the modern Indian tribes to develop in the Southwest. Around AD 1100 their culture began to develop in the Four Corners area of the region. The Navajos migrated from northwestern Canada and eastern Alaska, where the majority of Athabaskan speakers reside. The Ute were found over most of modern-day Utah and Colorado, as well as northern New Mexico and Arizona. The Paiutes roamed an area which covered over 45,000 square miles of southern Nevada and California, south-central Utah, and northern Arizona. The Hopi settled the lands of the central and western portions of northern Arizona. Their village of Oraibi, settled in approximately AD 1100, is, along with Acoma Sky City in New Mexico, one of the oldest continuously occupied settlements in the United States. The Mogollon area became occupied by the Apaches and the Zuni. The Apache migrated into the American Southwest from the northern areas of North America at some point between 1200 and 1500. They settled throughout New Mexico, eastern Arizona, northern Mexico, parts of western Texas, and southern Colorado. The Zuni count their direct ancestry through the ancestral Puebloans. The modern-day Zuni established a culture along the Zuni River in far-eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. Both major tribes of the O&#x27;odham tribe settled in the southern and central Arizona, in the lands once controlled by their ancestors, the Hohokam.

===Arrival of Europeans===

The first European intrusion into the region came from the south. In 1539, a Jesuit Franciscan named Marcos de Niza led an expedition from Mexico City which passed through eastern Arizona. The following year Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, based on reports from survivors of the Narváez expedition (1528–36) who had crossed eastern Texas on their way to Mexico City, led an expedition to discover the Seven Golden Cities of Cíbola. The 1582–3 expedition of Antonio de Espejo explored New Mexico and eastern Arizona; and this led to Juan de Oñate&#x27;s establishment of the Spanish province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México in 1598, with a capital founded near Ohkay Oweenge Pueblo, which he called San Juan de los Caballeros. Oñate&#x27;s party also attempted to establish a settlement in Arizona in 1599, but were turned back by inclement weather. In 1610, Santa Fe was founded, making it the oldest capital in United States.

In 1664 Juan Archuleta led an expedition into what is now Colorado, becoming the first European to enter. A second Spanish expedition was led into Colorado by Juan Ulibarrí in 1706, during which he claimed the Colorado territory for Spain.

From 1687 to 1691 the Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino established several missions in the Santa Cruz River valley; and Kino further explored southern and central Arizona in 1694, during which he discovered the ruins of Casa Grande. Beginning in 1732, Spanish settlers began to enter the region, and the Spanish started bestowing land grants in Mexico and the Southwest US. In 1751, the O&#x27;odham rebelled against the Spanish incursions, but the revolt was unsuccessful. In fact, it had the exact opposite effect, for the result of the rebellion was the establishment of the presidio at Tubac, the first permanent European settlement in Arizona.

In 1768, the Spanish created the Provincia de las Californias, which included California and the Southwest US. Over approximately the next 50 years, the Spanish continued to explore the Southwest, and in 1776 the City of Tucson was founded when the Presidio San Augustin del Tucson was created, relocating the presidio from Tubac.

In 1776, two Franciscan priests, Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, led an expedition from Santa Fe heading to California. After passing through Colorado, they became the first Europeans to travel into what is now Utah. Their journey was halted by bad weather in October, and they turned back, heading south into Arizona before turning east back to Santa Fe.
In 1804 Spain divided the Provincia de las Californias, creating the province Alta California, which consisted primarily of what would become California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico. In 1821 Mexico achieved its independence from Spain and shortly after, in 1824, developed its constitution, which established the Alta California territory, which was the same geographic area as the earlier Spanish province.

In 1825, Arizona was visited by its first non-Spanish Europeans, English trappers. In 1836, the Republic of Texas, which contained the easternmost of the Southwest United States, won its independence from Mexico. In 1845 the Republic of Texas was annexed by the United States and immediately became a state, bypassing the usual territory phase. The new state still contained portions of what would eventually become parts of other states. In 1846, the Southwest became embroiled in the Mexican–American War, partly as a result of the United States&#x27; annexation of Texas. On August 18, 1846, an American force captured Santa Fe, New Mexico. On December 16 of the same year, American forces captured Tucson, Arizona, marking the end of hostilities in the Southwest United States. When the war ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, the United States gained control of all of present-day California, Nevada and Utah, as well as the majority of Arizona, and parts of New Mexico and Colorado (the rest of present-day Colorado, and most of New Mexico had been gained by the United States in their annexation of the Republic of Texas). The final portion of the Southwestern United States came about through the acquisition of the southernmost parts of Arizona and New Mexico through the Gadsden Purchase in 1853.

In 1851, San Luis became the first European settlement in what is now Colorado.

===Becoming states===
Of the states of which at least a portion make up the Southwest, Texas was the first to achieve statehood. On December 29, 1845, the Republic of Texas was annexed, bypassing the status of becoming a territory, and immediately became a state. Initially, its borders included parts of what would become several other states: almost half of New Mexico, a third of Colorado, and small portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. Texas current borders were set in the Compromise of 1850, where Texas ceded land to the federal government in exchange for $10 million, which would go to paying off the debt Texas had accumulated in its war with Mexico.

Following the Mexican Cession, the lands of what had been the Mexican territory of Alta California were in flux: portions of what is now New Mexico were claimed, but never controlled, by Texas. With the Compromise of 1850, the states of Texas and California were created (Texas as a slave state, and California as a free state), as well as the Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory. The New Mexico Territory consisted of most of Arizona and New Mexico (excluding a strip along their southern borders), a small section of southern Colorado, and the very southern tip of Nevada; while the Utah Territory consisted of Utah, most of Nevada, and portions of Wyoming and Colorado. The New Mexico Territory was expanded along its southern extent, to its current border, with the signing of the Gadsden Purchase Treaty on December 30, 1853, which was ratified by the U.S. Congress, with some slight alterations, in April 1854.

The Colorado Territory was organized on February 28, 1861, created out of lands then currently in the Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, and New Mexico territories. The Nevada Territory was also organized in 1861, on March 2, with land taken from the existing Utah Territory. Initially, only the western 2/3 of what is currently the State of Nevada was included in the territory, with its boundary to the east being the 39th meridian west from Washington, and to the south the 37th parallel. In 1862 Nevada&#x27;s eastern border shifted to the 38th meridian west from Washington, and finally to its current position at the 37th meridian west from Washington in 1866. The boundary modification in 1866 also included adding the southern triangular tip of the present-day state, taken from the Arizona Territory.

From July 24–27, 1861 a Confederate force under the command of Lt. Colonel John Robert Baylor forced the surrender of the small Union garrison stationed at Fort Fillmore, near Mesilla, New Mexico. On August 1, 1861, Baylor declared the creation of the Arizona Territory, and claimed it for the Confederacy, with Mesilla as its capital. The territory, which had been formed by the portion of the existing New Mexico Territory below the 34th parallel, became official on February 14, 1862.

Nevada was admitted to the Union on October 31, 1864, becoming the 36th state. This was followed by the admittance to the Union of Colorado, which became the 38th state on August 1, 1876. Confederate Arizona was short-lived, however. By May 1862, Confederate forces had been driven out of the region by union troops. That same month a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress, and on February 24, 1863 Abraham Lincoln signed the Arizona Organic Act, which officially created the U.S. Territory of Arizona, splitting the New Mexico Territory at the 107th meridian.

Utah, as shown above, evolved out of the Utah Territory, as pieces of the original territory created in 1850 were carved out: parts were ceded to Nevada, Wyoming, and Colorado in 1861; another section to Nevada in 1862; and the final section to Nevada in 1866. In 1890, the LDS church issued the 1890 Manifesto, which officially banned polygamy for members of the church. It was the last roadblock for Utah entering the Union, and on January 4, 1896, Utah was officially granted statehood, becoming the 45th state.

In 1869, John Wesley Powell led a 3-month expedition which explored the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. In 1875, he would publish a book describing his explorations, &quot;Report of the Exploration of the Columbia River of the West and Its Tributaries&quot;, which was later republished as &quot;The Exploration of the Colorado River and Its Canyons&quot;.

In 1877 silver was discovered in southeastern Arizona. The notorious mining town of Tombstone, Arizona was born to service the miners. The town would become immortalized as the scene of what is considered the greatest gunfight in the history of the Old West, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.

Copper was also discovered in 1877, near Bisbee and Jerome in Arizona, which became an important component of the economy of the Southwest. Production began in 1880 and was made more profitable by the expansion of the railroad throughout the territory during the 1880s.
The early 1880s also saw the completion of the second transcontinental railroad, which ran through the heart of the Southwest, called the &quot;Santa Fe Route.&quot; It ran from Chicago, down through Topeka, then further south to Albuquerque, before heading almost due west through northern Arizona to Los Angeles.

The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to the decline of the silver mining industry in the region.

In 1901, the Santa Fe Railroad reached the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, opening the way for a tourism boom, a trend led by restaurant and hotel entrepreneur Fred Harvey.

The last two territories within the Southwest to achieve statehood were New Mexico and Arizona. By 1863, with the splitting off of the Arizona Territory, New Mexico reached its modern borders. They became states within forty days of one another. On January 6, 1912, New Mexico became the 47th state in the Union. Arizona would shortly follow, becoming the last of the 48 contiguous United States on February 14, 1912.

===Since statehood===
====Ski industry====
 The 1930s saw the beginning of the ski industry in the Southwest. Resorts were established in Colorado in areas such as Estes Park, Gunnison, and on Loveland Pass. New Mexico&#x27;s oldest ski area is Sandia Peak Ski Area at the eastern edge of Albuquerque, which opened to skiers in 1936. At the end of the decade, in 1939, with the establishment of Alta Ski Area, Utah&#x27;s skiing began to be developed.

Due to the ski conditions in the state, during WWII, the 10th Mountain Division established Camp Hale in Colorado to train elite ski troops.

==Origins of the term and historical/cultural variations==
While this article deals with the core definition for the American Southwest, there are many others. The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest has become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the National Geographic Society defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society&#x27;s definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California. Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include Erna Fergusson, Charles Lummis (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer Raymond Gastil, and ethnologist Miguel León-Portilla.

Geographer D. W. Meinig defines the Southwest in a very similar fashion to Reed: the portion of New Mexico west of the Llano Estacado and the portion of Arizona east of the Mojave-Sonoran Desert and south of the &quot;canyon lands&quot; and also including the El Paso district of western Texas and the southernmost part of Colorado. Meinig breaks the Southwest down into four distinct subregions. He calls the first subregion &quot;Northern New Mexico,&quot; and describes it as focused on Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It extends from the San Luis Valley of southern Colorado to south of Socorro and including the Sandia-Manzano Mountains, with an east–west breadth in the north stretching from the upper Canadian River to the upper San Juan River. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes called Central New Mexico.

&quot;Central Arizona&quot; is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the Phoenix metropolitan area. The city of Phoenix is the largest urban center, and located in the approximate center of the area that includes Tempe, Mesa, and many others.

Meinig calls the third subregion &quot;El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern Borderlands.&quot; While El Paso and Tucson are distinctly different cities, they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them. Tucson occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements serving both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. About to the southeast are the research facilities at Fort Huachuca. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as Sierra Vista, Las Cruces, and Alamogordo. El Paso&#x27;s influence extends north into the Mesilla Valley, and southeast along the Rio Grande into the Trans-Pecos region of Texas.

The fourth subregion Meinig calls the &quot;Northern Corridor and Navajolands,&quot; a major highway and railway trunk which connects Albuquerque and Flagstaff. Just north of the transportation trunk are large blocks of American Indian land.

===Historical/archeological===

As the US expanded westward, the country&#x27;s western border also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and Northwestern United States. In the early years of the United States, newly colonized lands lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were detached from North Carolina and given the name Southwest Territory. During the decades that followed, the region known as &quot;the Southwestern United States&quot; covered much of the Deep South east of the Mississippi River.

However, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the Mexican–American War, the geographical &quot;Southwest&quot; expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became &quot;increasingly unclear.&quot;

However, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed&#x27;s definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest&#x27;s definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada. This will be the defined scope that is used in this article unless otherwise specified in a particular area.

===Geological/topographical===

Parts of the other states make up the various areas that can be included in the Southwest, depending on the source. The Learning Center of the American Southwest (LCAS) does not rely on current state boundaries, and defines the American Southwest as parts of Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah.
From this perspective, almost all of the region&#x27;s physiographical traits, geological formations, and weather are contained within a box between 26° and 38° northern latitude, and 98° 30&#x27; and 124° western longitude.

===Ecological===
When looking at the fauna of the region, there is a broader definition of the American Southwest. The Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research defines the Southwest as being only the states of Arizona, New Mexico, with parts of California, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; although they include all of those six states in their map of the region, solely for ease of defining the border.

===Cultural===
Lawrence Clark Powell, a major bibliographer whose emphasis is on the Southwest, defined the American Southwest in a 1958 &quot;Arizona Highways&quot; article as, &quot;the lands lying west of the Pecos, north of the [Mexican] Border, south of the Mesa Verde and the Grand Canyon, and east of the mountains which wall off Southern California and make it a land in itself.&quot;

Texas has long been the focal point of this dichotomy, and is often considered, as such, the &quot;core area&quot; of &quot;the South&#x27;s Southwest.&quot; While the Trans-Pecos area is generally acknowledged as part of the &quot;desert Southwest&quot;, most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the South, which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the &quot;Western South.&quot; This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern history, culture, politics, religion, and linguistic and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic &quot;Old South&quot; or Southeast, these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.

One of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas—in addition to having been a Confederate state during the Civil War—is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South. Although the present-day state of Oklahoma was Indian Territory until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.

The fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma—unlike those in other &quot;southwestern&quot; states—self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners—also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.

==Vegetation and terrain==
Vegetation of the southwest generally includes various types of yucca, along with saguaro cactus, barrel cactus, prickly pear cactus, desert spoon, creosote bush, sagebrush, and greasewood. Many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. Steppe is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The mountains of the southwestern states have large tracts of alpine trees.
Landscape features of the core southwestern areas include mountains, canyons, mesas, buttes, high broad basins, plateaus, desert lands, and some plains, characteristic of the Basin and Range Province. The entire southwestern region features semi-arid to arid terrain. The far eastern part of southwestern Texas, for example, the Texas Hill Country, consists of dry, tall, and rugged rocky hills of limestone and granite. South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley is mostly flat with many places consisting of scrub and bare topsoil, much like the deserts further west.

==Wildlife==
The region has an extremely diverse bird population, with hundreds of species being found in the American Southwest. In the Chiricahua Mountains alone, in southeastern Arizona, there can be found more than 400 species. Species include Canadian (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) and snow geese, sandhill cranes (&quot;Grus canadensis&quot;), and the roadrunner, the state bird of New Mexico and most famous bird in the region, is found in all states of the Southwest. Birds of prey include the red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), the osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;), golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), Harris&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Parabuteo unicinctus&quot;), American kestrel (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;), peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), the gray hawk (&quot;Buteo plagiatus&quot;), the American barn owl (&quot;Tyto furcata&quot;), the western screech owl (&quot;Megascops kennicottii&quot;), the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), the elf owl (&quot;Micrathene whitneyi&quot;), and the burrowing owl (&quot;Athene cunicularia&quot;)

Other bird species include the turkey vulture (&quot;Cathartes aura&quot;), the black vulture (&quot;Coragyps atratus&quot;), the northern cardinal (&quot;Cardinalis cardinalis&quot;), the blue grosbeak (&quot;Passerina caerulea&quot;), the house finch (&quot;Haemorhous mexicanus&quot;), the lesser goldfinch (&quot;Spinus psaltria&quot;), the broad-billed hummingbird (&quot;Cynanthus latirostris&quot;), the black-chinned hummingbird (&quot;Archilochus alexandri&quot;), Costa&#x27;s hummingbird (&quot;Calypte costae&quot;), Gambel&#x27;s quail (&quot;Callipepla gambelii&quot;), the common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), the Gila woodpecker (&quot;Melanerpes uropygialis&quot;), the gilded flicker (&quot;Colaptes chrysoides&quot;), the cactus wren (&quot;Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus&quot;), the rock wren (&quot;Salpinctes obsoletus&quot;), and the federally endangered Southwest willow flycatcher (&quot;Empidonax traillii extimus&quot;). Four types of doves call the Southwest home: the white-winged dove (&quot;Zenaida asiatica&quot;), the mourning dove (&quot;Zenaida macroura&quot;), the common ground dove (&quot;Columbina passerina&quot;), and the Inca dove (&quot;Columbina inca&quot;).
Mammal species include the bobcat, coyote, black bear, black-tailed jackrabbit, desert cottontail, desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, white-tailed deer, gray fox, mountain lion, river otter, long-tailed weasel, western spotted skunk, pronghorn, raccoon, cactus mouse, and Ord&#x27;s kangaroo rat, all of which can be found in parts of every southwestern state. Elk are found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona. White-nosed coati and collared peccaryor &quot;javelina&quot;in the Southwest are normally found in southern areas of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas near the Mexican border. Jaguars can be found in the bootheel region of Southwestern New Mexico. The Mexican wolf (&quot;Canis lupus baileyi&quot;) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study reported a minimum population of 241 Mexican wolves in southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona at the beginning of 2023.

There is a large contingent of snakes native to the region. Among them include the rosy boa (&quot;Lichanura trivirgata&quot;); several sub-species of the glossy snake (&quot;Arizona elegans&quot;); the Trans-Pecos ratsnake (&quot;Bogertophis subocularis&quot;); several sub-species of shovel-nosed snakes; several sub-species of kingsnake, including the desert kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis getula splendida&quot;) and the Arizona mountain kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis pyromelana&quot;); the Arizona coral snake (&quot;Micruroides euryxanthus&quot;); the western diamondback rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot;); the Trans-Pecos copperhead (&quot;Agkistrodon contortrix pictigaster&quot;); the Sonoran sidewinder (&quot;Crotalus cerastes cercobombus&quot;); the Arizona black rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus oreganus cerberus&quot;); the western rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus viridis&quot;); the Grand Canyon rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus oreganus abyssus&quot;), found only in Arizona; several sub-species of the ridge-nosed rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus willardi&quot;), the most recent rattlesnake species to be discovered in the United States, including the New Mexico ridge-nosed rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus willardi obscurus&quot;), and the Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake, the state reptile of Arizona; and the desert massasauga (&quot;Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii&quot;).

Other reptiles in the region include lizards and turtles. Lizards are highly represented in the region, the most distinctive denizen being the Gila monster, native only to the American Southwest and the state of Sonora in Mexico. The New Mexico whiptail is the state reptile of New Mexico. Other lizards include: Sonoran collared lizard (&quot;Crotaphytus nebrius&quot;); several types of geckos, including western banded gecko (&quot;Coleonyx variegatus&quot;), the common house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;), and the Mediterranean house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus turcicus&quot;), the last two species being non-native to the region but have been introduced; the desert iguana (&quot;Dipsosaurus dorsalis&quot;); the chuckwalla (&quot;Sauromalus ater&quot;); the greater earless lizard (&quot;Cophosaurus texanus scitulus&quot;); several sub-species of horned lizards (&quot;Phrynosoma&quot;); numerous species of spiny lizards (&quot;Sceloporus&quot;); Gilbert&#x27;s skink (&quot;Plestiodon gilberti&quot;); the western skink (&quot;Plestiodon skiltonianus&quot;); Trans-Pecos striped whiptail (&quot;Aspidoscelis inornata heptagrammus&quot;); and the Arizona night lizard (&quot;Xantusia arizonae&quot;). Turtles are less numerous than their other reptilian counterparts, but several are found in the region, including: the western painted turtle (&quot;Chrysemys picta bellii&quot;); the Rio Grande cooter (&quot;Pseudemys gorzugi&quot;); the desert box turtle (&quot;Terrapene ornata luteola&quot;); the Big Bend slider (&quot;Trachemys gaigeae gaigeae&quot;); the Sonora mud turtle (&quot;Kinosternon sonoriense&quot;); and the desert tortoise (&quot;Gopherus agassizii&quot;).

Amphibians include numerous toads and frogs in the American Southwest. Toads which can be found in the region include the Great Plains toad (&quot;Anaxyrus cognatus&quot;); the green toad (&quot;Anaxyrus debilis&quot;); the Arizona toad (&quot;Anaxyrus microscaphus&quot;); the New Mexico spadefoot (&quot;Spea multiplicata stagnalis&quot;); and the Colorado River toad (&quot;Incilius alvarius&quot;), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad. Frog representation includes: western barking frog (&quot;Craugastor augusti&quot;); the canyon tree frog (&quot;Hyla arenicolor&quot;); the Arizona treefrog (&quot;Hyla wrightorum&quot;); the western chorus frog (&quot;Pseudacris triseriata&quot;); Chiricahua leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates chiricahuensis&quot;); and the relict leopard frog (&quot;Lithobates onca&quot;). There are quite a few salamanders throughout the region, including: the Arizona tiger salamander (&quot;Ambystoma mavortium nebulosum&quot;) and the painted ensatina (&quot;Ensatina eschscholtzii picta&quot;).

Despite the Southwest being mostly arid, various fishes are found where water is available, including various species unique to the region. Apache trout and Gila trout are two salmonids endemic to the area, with the former found only in Arizona and the latter only in Arizona and New Mexico. Desert pupfishes are several closely related species of fish in the genus Cyprinodon, many of which are found in isolated spring-fed ponds hundreds of miles from each other, ranging from far West Texas to Death Valley in California. These pupfishes often thrive in water considerably higher in temperature and dissolved solids than most fish can tolerate. Many of these desert fish species are endangered due to their limited and tenuous habitat, as well as loss of habitat due to human consumption of groundwater and diversion of surface water, as well as the introduction of species such as sportfish for recreation (see: Rio Grande Silvery Minnow v. Bureau of Reclamation).

==Climate==

The southwestern United States features a semi-arid to arid climate, depending on the location. Much of the Southwest is an arid desert climate, but higher elevations in the mountains in each state, with the exception of West Texas, feature alpine climates with very large amounts of snow. The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains. Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.

Nevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the Trans-Pecos area.

 The term &quot;High Desert&quot; is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the Mojave Desert and the Colorado Plateau, which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, east to the Rio Grande Rift in New Mexico. The High Desert also extends into parts of the Northwest, such as the Red Desert in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the lower desert lands found in Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly. Rain falls in this region mainly in the summer, during the North American Monsoon season.

The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the Roan Plateau, Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado National Monument, Royal Gorge, Cortez, Dove Creek, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Four Corners Monument, Montrose, Blue Mesa Reservoir, Pueblo, San Luis Valley, Great Sand Dunes and Joshua Tree National Park. Besides the Chihuahuan Desert, lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.

During El Niño, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Niña, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay farther north. The Southwest also experiences multi-year and multi-decade episodes of severe drought, including the ongoing southwestern North American megadrought which emerged starting year 2000.

==Demographics==
Hispanic Americans can be found in large numbers in every major city in the Southwest such as El Paso (80%), San Antonio (63%), Los Angeles (48%), Albuquerque (47%), Phoenix (43%), Tucson (41%), Las Vegas (32%), and Mesa (27%). Over 60 percent of the Latino population in the Southwest is Mexican American.

Very large Hispanic American populations can also be found in the smaller cities such as Eagle Pass (96%), Las Cruces (56%), Yuma (55%), Blythe (53%), Pueblo (48%), Santa Fe (48%), and Glendale (36%). Many small towns throughout the southwestern states also have significantly large Latino populations.

The largest Asian American populations in the southwest can be found in California and Texas, with some significant Asian population in Phoenix. The most significant American Indian populations can be found in New Mexico and Arizona.

More than 20% of Native Americans live in the Southwest.

Before 1700, the only permanent Spanish settlements in the Southwest were along the valley of the upper Rio Grande in New Mexico.

==Cities and urban areas==
The area also contains many of the nation&#x27;s largest cities and metropolitan areas, despite relatively low population density in rural areas. Phoenix is the fifth most populous city in the country, and Albuquerque and Las Vegas were some of the fastest-growing cities in the United States. Also, the region as a whole has witnessed some of the highest population growth in the United States, and according to the US Census Bureau, in 2008–2009, Utah was the fastest-growing state in America. As of the 2010 Census, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the United States, with an increase of 35.1% in the last ten years. Additionally, Arizona (24.6%), Utah (23.8%), Texas (20.6%), and Colorado (16.9%) were all in the top ten fastest-growing states as well.

The largest metropolitan areas are centered around Phoenix (with an estimated population of more than 5 million ), Las Vegas (more than 2.2 million), Tucson (more than 1 million), Albuquerque (more than 900,000), and El Paso (more than 840,000). Those five metropolitan areas have an estimated total population of more than 9.6 million , with nearly 60 percent of them living in the two Arizona cities—Phoenix and Tucson.

==Sports==
===Professional===
Of the four major professional sports, Phoenix and Las Vegas are the only metropolitan areas in the Southwest that have representatives. Las Vegas is home to the Las Vegas Raiders NFL football team and the Vegas Golden Knights NHL hockey team. Phoenix is home to the Arizona Diamondbacks in Major League Baseball, Arizona Cardinals in the National Football League, and the Phoenix Suns in the National Basketball Association. The Greater Phoenix area is home to the Cactus League, one of two spring training leagues for Major League Baseball; fifteen of MLB&#x27;s thirty teams are now included in the Cactus League. The region has also been the scene of several NFL super bowls. Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe held Super Bowl XXX in 1996, when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers. State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona hosted Super Bowl XLII on February 3, 2008, in which the New York Giants defeated the New England Patriots, as well as Super Bowl XLIX, which resulted in the New England Patriots defeating the Seattle Seahawks 28–24. The U.S. Airways Center hosted both the 1995 and the 2009 NBA All-Star Games.

In 1997, the Phoenix Mercury were one of the original eight teams to launch the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Indoor American football is represented by the Arizona Rattlers located in Phoenix. The region is also host to several major professional golf events: the LPGA&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Cup; the Phoenix Open and the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open (in Las Vegas) of the PGA; and the Tucson Conquistadores Classic (in Tucson), and the Charles Schwab Cup Championship (in Scottsdale) on the Champions Tour of the PGA.

NASCAR has two venues within the region: The Phoenix International Raceway, was built in 1964 with a one-mile oval, with a one-of-a-kind design, as well as a 2.5-mile road course, and the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, a 1,200-acre (490 ha) complex of multiple tracks for motorsports racing. There are several nationally recognized running events in the region, including The Phoenix Marathon, a qualifier for the Boston Marathon, and the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Marathon Series in both Phoenix and Las Vegas. Las Vegas is also the end point for the annual Baker to Vegas Challenge Cup Relay, a 120-mile-long foot race by law enforcement teams from around the world, which is the largest law enforcement athletic event in the world. 

The Professional Bull Riders association has its headquarters in Pueblo, Colorado. The PBR World Finals are held annually in Las Vegas, which also hosts the National Finals Rodeo.

Since the 1950s, Las Vegas has been host to many of professional boxing&#x27;s largest events, beginning with the Heavyweight non-title bout in 1955 between world light heavyweight champion Archie Moore and perennial contender Niño Valdés. Muhammad Ali fought his last world title bout in Las Vegas against Larry Holmes in 1980, and Floyd Mayweather fought many of his major fights there.

===College===
The Southwest is home to a rich tradition of college sports. The Big-12 Conference has two teams in the region, the Arizona State Sun Devils and the University of Arizona Wildcats. The Mountain West Conference also has two teams, the UNLV Rebels and the University of New Mexico Lobos. Conference USA is represented by the University of Texas at El Paso Miners. The Big Sky Conference has two teams: the Lumberjacks of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Southern Utah University Thunderbirds in Cedar City, Utah. The Western Athletic Conference also has two representatives, the New Mexico State University Aggies in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and the Grand Canyon University Antelopes in Phoenix.

Las Vegas is becoming the nexus for NCAA league basketball tournaments. The Mountain West Conference, the Western Athletic Conference, the West Coast Conference, and the Pac-12 Conference all hold their conference basketball tournaments in Las Vegas.

The Southwest is the site of six college football bowl games: the Rate Bowl, formerly known as the Cheez-it Bowl, in Phoenix; the Arizona Bowl in Tucson; the Fiesta Bowl, played at the University of Phoenix Stadium; the Las Vegas Bowl; the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque; and the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas.

The erstwhile [20th century] Southwest Conference might seem to have been named after this region, but it had no teams from Arizona nor New Mexico. All but one of its teams were from schools in Texas.

<text>Władziu Valentino Liberace (May 16, 1919 – February 4, 1987) was an American pianist, singer and actor. He was born in Wisconsin to parents of Italian and Polish origin and enjoyed a career spanning four decades of concerts, recordings, television, motion pictures and endorsements. At the height of his fame from the 1950s to 1970s, he was the highest-paid entertainer in the world with established concert residencies in Las Vegas and an international touring schedule. He embraced a lifestyle of flamboyant excess both on and off stage.

==Early life and education==
Władziu Valentino Liberace (known as Lee to his friends and Walter to family) was born in West Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 16, 1919. His grandfather Valentino Liberace (1836–1909) was a casket maker from Formia in central Italy where his father, musician Salvatore (&quot;Sam&quot;) Liberace (1885–1977), was born. His mother, Frances Zuchowski (1891–1980) was born in Menasha, Wisconsin, and was of Polish descent. Liberace had an identical twin who died at birth. He had three surviving siblings: a brother George (who was a violinist), a sister Angelina, and younger brother Rudy (Rudolph Valentino Liberace, named after the actor due to his mother&#x27;s interest in show business).

Liberace&#x27;s father played the French horn in bands and cinemas, and often worked as a factory worker or laborer. While Sam encouraged music in his family, his wife Frances (despite having been a concert pianist before her marriage) believed music lessons and a record player to be unaffordable luxuries. This disagreement caused family disputes. Liberace later said &quot;My dad&#x27;s love and respect for music created in him a deep determination to give as his legacy to the world, a family of musicians dedicated to the advancement of the art.&quot;

Liberace began playing the piano at the age of four. While Sam took his children to concerts to further expose them to music, he was a taskmaster demanding high standards from the children in both practice and performance. Liberace&#x27;s prodigious talent was evident from his early years. By the age of 7, he was capable of memorizing difficult pieces. He studied the technique of the Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski. At the age of eight, he met Paderewski backstage after a concert at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee. &quot;I was intoxicated by the joy I got from the great virtuoso&#x27;s playing&quot;, Liberace said later. &quot;My dreams were filled with fantasies of following his footsteps...Inspired and fired with ambition, I began to practice with a fervour that made my previous interest in the piano look like neglect.&quot; Paderewski later became a family friend as well as Liberace&#x27;s mentor, to whom the protege never missed any opportunities to pay tribute.

The Depression was financially hard on the Liberace family. In childhood, Liberace suffered from a speech impediment; as a teen, he was taunted by neighborhood children, who mocked him for his effeminate personality, his avoidance of sports, and his fondness for cooking and the piano. Liberace concentrated on his piano playing with the help of music teacher Florence Kelly, who oversaw Liberace&#x27;s musical development for ten years. He gained experience playing popular music in theaters, on local radio, for dancing classes, clubs and weddings.

In 1934, he played jazz piano with a school group named The Mixers and later with other groups. Liberace performed in cabarets and strip clubs. Although Sam and Frances did not approve, their son was earning a living during hard times. For a while, Liberace adopted the stage name Walter Busterkeys. He showed an interest in draftsmanship, design and painting, and he became a fastidious dresser and follower of fashion. By this time, he was displaying a penchant for turning eccentricities into attention-getting practices, and he earned popularity at school despite some making him an object of ridicule.

==Career==
===Early career===

A participant in a formal classical music competition in 1937, Liberace was praised for his &quot;flair and showmanship&quot;. At the end of a traditional classical concert in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1939, Liberace played his first requested encore, the popular comedy song &quot;Three Little Fishies&quot;. He later stated that he played the popular tune in the styles of several different classical composers. The 20-year-old played with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on January 15, 1940, at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, performing Liszt&#x27;s Second Piano Concerto under the baton of Hans Lange, for which he received strong reviews. He also toured in the Midwest.

From 1942 to 1944, Liberace moved from straight classical performance and reinvented his act to one featuring &quot;pop with a bit of classics&quot; or as he called it &quot;classical music with the boring parts left out&quot;. In the early 1940s, he struggled in New York City, but by the mid- and late-1940s, he was performing in night clubs in major cities around the United States and &quot;gained national exposure through his performance contracts with the Statler and Radisson hotel chains&quot;, largely abandoning classical music. He changed from a classical pianist to an entertainer and showman, unpredictably and whimsically mixing the serious with light fare, e.g., Chopin with &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.

For a while, he played piano along with a phonograph on stage. The gimmick helped gain him attention. He added interaction with the audience—taking requests, talking with the patrons, making jokes, giving lessons to chosen audience members. He began to pay greater attention to such details as staging, lighting and presentation. The transformation to entertainer was driven by Liberace&#x27;s desire to connect directly with his audiences, and secondarily from the reality of the difficult, top flight competition in the classical piano world.

In 1943, he began to appear in Soundies (the 1940s precursor to music videos). He recreated two flashy numbers from his nightclub act, the standards &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Street Rag&quot;. In these films, he was billed as Walter Liberace. Both Soundies later were released to the home-movie market by Castle Films. In 1944, he made his first appearances in Las Vegas, which later became his principal venue.

He was playing at the best clubs, finally appearing at the Persian Room in 1945, and &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Liberace looks like a cross between Cary Grant and Robert Alda. He has an effective manner, attractive hands which he spotlights properly, and withal, rings the bell in the dramatically lighted, well-presented, showmanly routine. He should snowball into box office.&quot; &quot;The Chicago Times&quot; was similarly impressed: He &quot;made like Chopin one minute and then turns on a Chico Marx bit the next.&quot;
During this time, Liberace worked to refine his act. He added the candelabrum as his trademark, inspired by a similar prop in the Chopin biopic &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; (1945). He adopted Liberace as his stage name, making a point in press releases that it was pronounced &quot;Liber-Ah-chee&quot;. He wore white tie and tails for better visibility in large halls. Besides clubs and occasional work as an accompanist and rehearsal pianist, Liberace played for private parties, including ones at the Park Avenue home of millionaire oilman J. Paul Getty. By 1947, he was billing himself as &quot;Liberace—the most amazing piano virtuoso of the present day.&quot;

In 1953, Liberace signed with Louis Snader, a California theater owner and TV producer whose telescriptions—short film clips used as fillers on local stations across the country. Liberace was replacing Korla Pandit who parted ways with Snader due to a contract dispute. According to Eric Christiansen, the filmmaker who made Pandit&#x27;s biopic: &quot;[Liberace] used the same sets and took credit for his staring into the camera and breaking that wall. He felt like Liberace stole his soul.&quot;

Liberace had to have a piano to match his growing presence, so he bought a rare, oversized, gold-leafed Blüthner Grand, which he hyped up in his press kit as a &quot;priceless piano&quot;. Later, he performed with an array of extravagant, custom-decorated pianos, some encrusted with rhinestones and mirrors. He moved to the Los Angeles neighborhood of North Hollywood in 1947 and was performing at local clubs, such as Ciro&#x27;s and The Mocambo, for stars such as Rosalind Russell, Clark Gable, Gloria Swanson and Shirley Temple. He did not always play to packed rooms, and he learned to perform with extra energy to thinner crowds to maintain his enthusiasm.

Liberace created a publicity machine that helped to make him a star. Despite his success in the supper-club circuit, where he was often an intermission act, his ambition was to reach larger audiences as a headliner and a television, movie and recording star. Liberace began to expand his act and made it more extravagant, with more costumes and a larger supporting cast. His large-scale Las Vegas act became his hallmark, expanding his fan base and making him wealthy.

His New York City performance at Madison Square Garden in 1954, which earned him a record $138,000 () for one performance, was more successful than the great triumph his idol Paderewski had made 20 years earlier. He was mentioned as a sex symbol in The Chordettes 1954 No. 1 hit &quot;Mr. Sandman&quot;. By 1955, he was making $50,000 per week () at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and had over 200 official fan clubs with 250,000 members. He was making over $1 million per year from public appearances and millions from television. Liberace was frequently covered by the major magazines, and he became a pop-culture superstar, but he became the butt of jokes by comedians and the public.

Liberace appeared on the March 8, 1956, episode of the TV quiz program &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;, hosted by Groucho Marx.

Music critics were generally harsh in their assessment of his piano playing. Critic Lewis Funke wrote after a Carnegie Hall concert, Liberace&#x27;s music &quot;must be served with all the available tricks, as loud as possible, as soft as possible, and as sentimental as possible. It&#x27;s almost all showmanship topped by whipped cream and cherries.&quot; Even worse, to said critics, was his apparent lack of reverence and fidelity to the great composers. &quot;Liberace recreates—if that is the word—each composition in his own image. When it is too difficult, he simplifies it. When it is too simple, he complicates it.&quot; They referred to his &quot;sloppy technique&quot; that included &quot;slackness of rhythms, wrong tempos, distorted phrasing, an excess of prettification and sentimentality, a failure to stick to what the composer has written.&quot;

Liberace once stated &quot;I don&#x27;t give concerts. I put on a show.&quot; Unlike the concerts of classical pianists that normally ended with applause and a retreat off-stage, Liberace&#x27;s shows ended with the public invited on-stage to touch his clothes, piano, jewelry and hands. Kisses, handshakes, hugs and caresses usually followed. A critic summarized his appeal near the end of Liberace&#x27;s life: &quot;Mr. Showmanship has another more potent, drawing power to his show: the warm and wonderful way he works his audience. Surprisingly enough, behind all the glitz glitter, the corny false modesty, and the shy smile, Liberace exudes a love that is returned to him a thousand-fold.&quot;

===Early television work and &quot;The Liberace Show&quot;===

Liberace mostly bypassed radio before trying a television career, thinking radio unsuitable given his act&#x27;s dependence on the visual. Despite his enthusiasm about the possibilities of television, Liberace was disappointed after his early guest appearances on &quot;The Kate Smith Show&quot; and DuMont&#x27;s &quot;Cavalcade of Stars&quot;, with Jackie Gleason. Liberace was particularly displeased with the frenetic camera work and his short appearance time. He soon wanted his own show where he could control his presentation as he did with his club shows.

His first show on local television in Los Angeles was a smash hit, earning the highest ratings of any local show, which he parlayed into a sold-out appearance at the Hollywood Bowl. It led to a summer replacement program for Dinah Shore.

The 15-minute network television program &quot;The Liberace Show&quot; began on July 1, 1952, but did not lead to a regular network series. Instead, producer Duke Goldstone mounted a filmed version of Liberace&#x27;s local show performed before a live audience for syndication in 1953 and sold it to scores of local stations. The widespread exposure of the syndicated series made the pianist more popular and prosperous than ever. His first two years&#x27; earnings from television netted him $7 million, and on future reruns, he earned up to 80% of the profits.

Liberace learned early to add &quot;schmaltz&quot; to his television show and to cater to the tastes of the mass audience by joking and chatting to the camera as if performing in the viewer&#x27;s own living room. He used dramatic lighting, split images, costume changes and exaggerated hand movements to create visual interest. His television performances featured enthusiasm and humor.

Liberace employed &quot;ritualistic domesticity&quot;, used by such early TV greats as Jack Benny and Lucille Ball. His brother George often appeared as guest violinist and orchestra director, and his mother was usually in the front row of the audience, with brother Rudy and sister Angelina often mentioned to lend an air of &quot;family&quot;. Liberace began each show in the same way, then mixed production numbers with chat, and signed off each broadcast softly singing &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot;, which he made his theme song. His musical selections were broad, including classics, show tunes, film melodies, Latin rhythms, ethnic songs and boogie-woogie.

The show was so popular with his mostly female television audience, he drew over 30 million viewers at any one time and received 10,000 fan letters per week. His show was one of the early ones to be shown on British commercial television in the 1950s, where it was broadcast on Sunday afternoons by Lew Grade&#x27;s Associated TeleVision. This exposure gave Liberace a dedicated following in the United Kingdom. Gay men found him appealing. Darden Asbury Pyron wrote &quot;Liberace was the first gay person Elton John had ever seen on television; he became his hero.&quot;

===After &quot;The Liberace Show&quot;===

In 1956, Liberace had his first international engagement, playing successfully in Havana, Cuba. He followed with a European tour later that year. Always a devout Catholic, Liberace considered his meeting with Pope Pius XII a highlight of his life. In 1960, Liberace performed at the London Palladium with Nat King Cole and Sammy Davis Jr. (it was the first televised &quot;command performance&quot;, now known as the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;, for Queen Elizabeth II).

On July 19, 1957, hours after Liberace gave a deposition in his $25 million libel suit against &quot;Confidential&quot; magazine, two masked intruders attacked his mother in the garage of Liberace&#x27;s home in Sherman Oaks, California. She was beaten and kicked, but her heavy corset may have protected her from being badly injured. Liberace was not informed about the assault until he finished his midnight show at the Moulin Rouge nightclub. Guards were hired to watch over Liberace&#x27;s house and the houses of his two brothers.

Despite successful European tours, his career had in fact been slumping since 1957, but Liberace re-built it by appealing directly to his fan base. Through live appearances in small-town supper clubs, and with television and promotional appearances, he began to regain popularity. On November 22, 1963, he suffered kidney failure, reportedly from accidentally inhaling excessive amounts of dry cleaning fumes from his newly cleaned costumes in a dressing room, and he nearly died. He later said that what saved him from more injury was being woken by his entourage to the news that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated. Told by doctors that his condition was fatal, he began to spend his entire fortune by buying extravagant gifts of furs, jewels, and even a house for friends, but then recovered after a month.

Re-energized, Liberace returned to Las Vegas, and increasing the glamor and glitz, he took on the sobriquet Mr. Showmanship. As his act swelled with spectacle, he famously stated &quot;I&#x27;m a one-man Disneyland.&quot; The costumes became more exotic (ostrich feathers, mink, capes and huge rings), entrances and exits more elaborate (chauffeured onstage in a Rolls-Royce or dropped in on a wire like &quot;Peter Pan&quot;), choreography more complex (involving chorus girls, cars and animals), and the novelty acts especially talented, with juvenile acts including Australian singer Jamie Redfern and Canadian banjo player Scotty Plummer. Barbra Streisand was the most notable new adult act he introduced, appearing with him early in her career.

Liberace&#x27;s energy and commercial ambitions took him in many directions. He owned an antiques store in Beverly Hills, California, and a restaurant in Las Vegas for many years. He even published cookbooks; the most famous of which was &quot;Liberace Cooks&quot;, co-authored by cookbook guru Carol Truax, which included &quot;Liberace Lasagna&quot; and &quot;Liberace Sticky Buns&quot;. The book features recipes &quot;from his seven dining rooms&quot; (of his Hollywood home).

Liberace&#x27;s live shows during the 1970s and 1980s remained major box-office attractions at the Las Vegas Hilton and Lake Tahoe, where he earned $300,000 per week.

===Later television work===
Liberace made significant appearances on other shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, Edward R. Murrow&#x27;s &quot;Person to Person&quot; as well as on the shows of Jack Benny and Red Skelton, on which he often parodied his own persona. A new &quot;Liberace Show&quot; premiered on ABC&#x27;s daytime schedule in 1958, featuring a less flamboyant, less glamorous persona, but it failed in six months as his popularity began slumping.

Liberace received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 for his contributions to the television industry. He continued to appear on television as a frequent and welcomed guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Jack Paar in the 1960s, with memorable exchanges with Zsa Zsa Gabor and Muhammad Ali, and later with Johnny Carson.

He was Red Skelton&#x27;s 1969 CBS summer replacement with his own variety hour, taped in London. Skelton and Lew Grade&#x27;s production companies co-produced this program. In a cameo on &quot;The Monkees&quot;, he appeared at an avant-garde art gallery as himself, gleefully smashing a grand piano with a sledgehammer as Mike Nesmith looked on and cringed in mock agony.

In the &quot;Batman&quot; television series in 1966 with Adam West and Burt Ward, Liberace played a dual role as concert pianist Chandell and his gangster-like twin Harry, who was extorting Chandell into a life of crime as Fingers, in the episodes &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Fingers&quot; and &quot;The Dead Ringers&quot;. The episodes of this two-part story were the highest-rated of all the show&#x27;s episodes.

His subsequent television appearances included episodes of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (1970), &quot;Kojak&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; (both 1978), all as himself. His performances in the last of these included a &quot;Concerto for the Birds&quot;, &quot;Misty&quot;, &quot;Five Foot Two&quot; and a rendition of &quot;Chopsticks&quot;. Television specials were made from Liberace&#x27;s show at the Las Vegas Hilton in 1978-1979 which were broadcast on CBS.

In the 1980s, he guest-starred on television shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (on a tenth-season episode hosted by Hulk Hogan and Mr. T) as well as the 1984 film &quot;Special People&quot;. In 1985, he appeared at the first &quot;WrestleMania&quot; as the guest timekeeper for the main event.

===Films===
Before his arrival in Hollywood in 1947, Liberace wanted to add acting to his list of accomplishments. His exposure to the Hollywood crowd through his club performances led to his first movie appearance in Universal&#x27;s &quot;South Sea Sinner&quot; (1950), a tropical island drama starring MacDonald Carey and Shelley Winters, in which he was billed as &quot;a Hoagy Carmichael sort of character with long hair&quot;. Liberace appeared as a guest star in two compilation features for RKO Radio Pictures. &quot;Footlight Varieties&quot; (1951) is an imitation-vaudeville hour and the little-known sequel &quot;Merry Mirthquakes&quot; (1953) featured Liberace as master of ceremonies.

In 1955, Liberace was at the height of his career when tapped by Warner Bros. for his first starring movie &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot; (1955), a remake of &quot;The Man Who Played God&quot; (1932), as a concert pianist who turns his efforts toward helping others when his career is cut short by deafness. In April 1955, &quot;Modern Screen&quot; magazine claimed Doris Day had been most often mentioned as Liberace&#x27;s leading lady, &quot;but it is doubtful that Doris will play the role. Liberace&#x27;s name alone will pack theatres and generous Liberace would like to give a newcomer a break.&quot; (Joanne Dru, an established movie actress, was the leading lady.) When &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot; was released in November, the studio mounted an ad and poster campaign with Liberace&#x27;s name in huge, eccentric, building-block letters above and much larger than the title. &quot;Fabulously yours in his first starring motion picture!&quot; was a tag line. The other players and staff were smallish at the bottom. The film was a critical and commercial failure because Liberace proved unable to translate his eccentric on-stage persona to that of a movie leading man. Warner quickly issued a pressbook ad supplement with new &quot;Starring&quot; billing below the title, in equal plain letters: &quot;Liberace, Joanne Dru, Dorothy Malone&quot;. TCM&#x27;s Robert Osborne recalls a dramatic demotion: When &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot; played first run at the Orpheum in Seattle, the billing was altered even more: Joanne Dru, Dorothy Malone, and Alex Nicol above the title (with big head shots of all three) and below the title in much smaller letters: &quot;with Liberace at the piano&quot;. Originally, &quot;Sincerely Yours&quot; was meant to be the first of a two-picture movie contract, but it proved a massive box-office flop. The studio then bought back the contract, effectively paying Liberace not to make a second movie.

The experience left Liberace so shaken that he largely abandoned his movie aspirations. He made two more big-screen appearances, but only in cameo roles. These were &quot;When the Boys Meet the Girls&quot; (1965), starring Connie Francis, where Liberace essentially played himself. He received kudos for his brief appearance as a casket salesman in &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), based on Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s satire of the funeral business and movie industry in Southern California.

===Recordings===
The massive success of Liberace&#x27;s syndicated television show was the main impetus behind his record sales. From 1947 to 1951, he recorded 10 discs. By 1954, it jumped to nearly 70. He released several recordings through Columbia Records, including &quot;Liberace by Candlelight&quot; (later on Dot and through direct television advertising) and sold over 400,000 albums by 1954. His most popular single was &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, selling over 300,000 copies. His theme song was &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot;, which he would customarily sing rather than play on any of his various pianos.

His albums included pop standards of the time, such as &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and included his interpretations of the classical piano repertoire such as Chopin and Liszt, but many fans of classical music widely criticized them (as well as Liberace&#x27;s skills as a pianist in general) for being &quot;pure fluff with minimal musicianship&quot;. In his life, he received six gold records.

===Final appearances===

Liberace&#x27;s final stage performance was at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall on November 2, 1986; it was his 18th show over a tour of 21 days (from October 16), and the concert series grossed just over $2.5 million at the theater box office. His final television appearance was on Christmas Day that same year on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, which had actually been videotaped in Chicago over one month earlier.

==Personal life==
Liberace was conservative in his political and religious beliefs. He believed fervently in capitalism, and he was fascinated with royalty, ceremony and luxury. He loved to socialize and was fascinated by the rich and famous. However, he still presented himself to his fans as one of them, a Midwesterner who had earned his success through hard work, and who invited them to enjoy it with him.

In the later years of his life, having earned sudden wealth, Liberace spent lavishly, displaying extravagant materialism in his life and his act. In 1953, he designed and built his first celebrity house in Sherman Oaks, California, on Valley Vista Blvd., located in the San Fernando Valley. The house featured a piano theme throughout, including a piano-shaped swimming pool that remains today. His dream home, with its lavish furnishings, elaborate bath and antiques, added to his image. He leveraged his fame through hundreds of promotional tie-ins with banks, insurance companies, automobile companies, food companies, and even morticians. Liberace was an experienced pitchman and relied on the support of his vast audience of housewives. Sponsors sent him complimentary products, including his white Cadillac limousine, and he reciprocated enthusiastically: &quot;If I am selling tuna fish, I believe in tuna fish.&quot; Liberace became bald in his middle-age years and was so insecure about his hair loss that he began wearing elaborate hairpieces and refused to let himself be seen without his toupee both in public and in private, even sleeping with them on.

Others criticized his proficient but flashy piano playing, his non-stop promotions, and his gaudy display of success. Outwardly, he remained undeterred, once sending a letter to a critic that stated &quot;Thank you for your very amusing review. After reading it, in fact, my brother George and I laughed all the way to the bank.&quot; He responded similarly to subsequent poor reviews, famously modifying it to &quot;I cried all the way to the bank.&quot; In an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; some years later, Liberace retold the anecdote to Johnny Carson and finished by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t cry all the way to the bank any more—I the bank!&quot;

===Lawsuits and allegations of homosexuality===

Liberace&#x27;s fame in the United States was matched for a time in the United Kingdom. In 1956, an article in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; by columnist Cassandra (William Connor) described Liberace as &quot;the summit of sex—the pinnacle of masculine, feminine and neuter. Everything that he, she and it can ever want...a deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, chromium-plated, scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured, mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love&quot;.

Liberace sent a telegram that read: &quot;What you said hurt me very much. I cried all the way to the bank.&quot; He sued the newspaper for libel, testifying in a London court that he was not homosexual and that he had never taken part in homosexual acts. He was represented in court by Gilbert Beyfus, one of the great barristers of the period. Liberace won the suit, partly on the basis of Connor&#x27;s use of the derogatory expression &quot;fruit-flavoured&quot;. The case partly hinged on whether Connor knew that &quot;fruit&quot; was American slang implying that an individual is a homosexual. After a three-week civil trial, a jury ruled in Liberace&#x27;s favor on June 16, 1959, and awarded him £8,000 in damages (around $22,400 at the time and ), which led Liberace to repeat the catchphrase to reporters: &quot;I cried all the way to the bank!&quot; Liberace&#x27;s popularization of the phrase inspired the title &quot;Crying All the Way to the Bank&quot;, for a detailed report of the trial based on transcripts, court reports and interviews, by the former &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; journalist Revel Barker.
Liberace sued and settled a similar case in the United States against &quot;Confidential&quot;. Rumors and gossip magazines frequently implied that Liberace was homosexual throughout his career, which he continued to vehemently deny. A typical issue of &quot;Confidential&quot; in 1957 stated &quot;Why Liberace&#x27;s Theme Song Should Be &#x27;Mad About the Boy!&#x27;&quot;

In 1982, Scott Thorson, Liberace&#x27;s 22-year-old former chauffeur and alleged live-in lover of five years, sued the pianist for $113 million in palimony after he was dismissed by Liberace. Liberace continued to deny that he was homosexual, and during court depositions in 1984, he insisted that Thorson was never his lover. The case was settled out of court in 1986, and Thorson received a $95,000 cash settlement plus three cars and three pet dogs worth another $20,000. Thorson stated after Liberace&#x27;s death that he settled because he knew that Liberace was dying and that he had intended to sue based on conversion of property rather than palimony. He later attested that Liberace was a &quot;boring guy&quot; in his private life and mostly preferred to spend his free time cooking, decorating, and playing with his dogs and that he never played the piano outside of his public performances. Thorson said &quot;He (Liberace) had several decorated, ornamental pianos in the various rooms of his house, but he never played them.&quot;

Because Liberace never publicly acknowledged that he was gay, knowledge of his true sexuality was muddled by stories of his friendships and romantic links with women. He further obscured his sexuality in articles such as &quot;Mature Women Are Best: TV&#x27;s Top Pianist Reveals What Kind of Woman He&#x27;d Marry&quot;.

In a 2011 interview, actress and close friend Betty White confirmed that Liberace was indeed gay and that she often was used as a &quot;beard&quot; by his managers to counter public rumors of the musician&#x27;s homosexuality.

==Illness and death==
Liberace was secretly diagnosed HIV positive in August 1985 by his private physician in Las Vegas. Aside from his long-term manager Seymour Heller and a few family members and associates, Liberace kept his terminal illness a secret until the day he died and did not seek medical treatment. Scott Thorson remarked that he was not aware that Liberace had any health issues and up until one year before his death that &quot;he was in overall excellent shape for his age; barrel-chested and powerfully built.&quot;

In August 1986, during one of his last interviews, with the TV news program &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Liberace hinted of his failing health when he said &quot;How can you enjoy life if you don&#x27;t have your health?&quot; He was hospitalized for pneumonia from January 23 to 27, 1987, at the Palm Springs county hospital.

Liberace died in the late morning of February 4, 1987, at his home in Palm Springs, California at age 67. He had a Catholic priest administer the last rites to him the day before his death.

At the time of Liberace&#x27;s death, his press agent said he had died from a combination of pernicious anemia, emphysema and heart disease. Liberace&#x27;s physician, Ronald Daniels, said he had died of heart failure caused by subacute encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease. The Riverside County coroner performed an autopsy and determined that Liberace&#x27;s cause of death was cytomegalovirus pneumonia, a frequent cause of death in people with AIDS. The coroner also determined that, at the time of his death, Liberace was HIV-positive, had pulmonary heart disease, and calcification of a heart valve. The coroner said that Liberace&#x27;s doctor had deliberately claimed a false cause of death because heart failure is never caused by encephalopathy. Author Darden Asbury Pyron wrote that Liberace had been HIV-positive and symptomatic from 1985 until his death.

Cary James Wyman, his personal assistant and alleged lover, had HIV and later died in May 1995 at age 34.

Liberace&#x27;s body is entombed along with his mother and brother at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles. In 1994, the Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedicated a Golden Palm Star to him.

==Awards==
Liberace was recognized during his career with two Emmy Awards, six gold albums, and two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Closure of Liberace Museum and Tivoli Gardens Restaurant==
In October 2010, the Liberace Museum in Las Vegas closed after 31 years of being open to the public. In June 2011, Liberace&#x27;s Tivoli Gardens Restaurant, then operated by Carluccio&#x27;s, closed its location next to the museum and relocated elsewhere. According to Liberace Foundation President Jack Rappaport, the museum had been in negotiations with money interests on the Las Vegas strip to relocate the museum but were unsuccessful. The Liberace Foundation, which provides college scholarships to up-and-coming performers, continued to function.

In January 2013, the Liberace Foundation announced plans to move the museum to downtown Las Vegas, with a targeted opening date of 2014. In 2014, however, Liberace Foundation chairman Jonathan Warren announced that the deal for the new museum had failed.

As of April 7, 2016, Liberace&#x27;s cars are on display, as well as a piano and several costumes, at the Liberace Garage, located in Las Vegas.

==Depiction in media==

* In the 1957 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Three Little Bops&quot;, the piano-playing pig imitates Liberace, saying, &quot;I wish my brother George was here.&quot;
* Also in 1957, Billy Barty parodied Liberace on an episode of &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot; by playing &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot; on a miniature piano bedecked with tiny candelabra that spouted milk.
* In 1981, Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;SCTV&quot; aired two skits with Dave Thomas playing Liberace. In the first, Liberace was a guest on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. In the second, a Christmas episode, Liberace performs &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;.
* On October 2, 1988, a television film titled &quot;Liberace&quot; aired on ABC, starring Andrew Robinson as Liberace, Rue McClanahan as his mother Frances Liberace, John Rubinstein and Maris Valainis as Scott Thorson; the film had the distinct advantage of using Liberace&#x27;s musical arrangements and recordings, and some of his costumes and jewelry, but it was evasive about his sexuality.

* In &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; episode &quot;Sammy and Me&quot; from 1996, Liberace is parodied in the form of a piano-playing cockroach named Liberoache. He is seen playing piano for Sammy Mantis Jr. (a parody of Sammy Davis Jr.) who sings his trademark song &quot;The Mantid Man&quot;. After they&#x27;re finished, Liberoache reveals his desire for Sammy Mantis to bite his head off (possibly a reference to Liberace&#x27;s homosexuality), to which Sammy obliges after peer pressure from fans.
* &quot;Liberace: Live from Heaven&quot;, a play imagining the entertainer&#x27;s heavenly &quot;trial&quot; following death, began on stage in early 2010. The show featured the voices of Bobby Crush as Liberace, Stephen Fry as Saint Peter, and Victoria Wood as God.

* &quot;Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff&quot;, an app-based video game from Tinyco which is produced in cooperation with the writers of &quot;Family Guy&quot; licensed the likeness and voice of Liberace from the Liberace Foundation for his appearance as a game character in 2017, according to Liberace Foundation chairman Jonathan Warren.
* Fred Armisen has portrayed Liberace in several &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches, most notably in &quot;Vincent Price&#x27;s Holiday Special&quot; sketches.
* &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;, the 2017 sequel to the 1982 cult classic &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (both produced by Ridley Scott), licensed the likeness and music of Liberace for an appearance in the film which takes place in a dystopian Las Vegas, alongside fellow icons Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.
* Non-binary artist Dorian Electra plays a personal interpretation of Liberace in the music video &quot;Flamboyant&quot; (2019).

==Legacy==

At the time of his death Liberace was said to be worth around $110 million and to have bequeathed $88 million to the Liberace Foundation. The story was perpetuated by the officers of the Liberace Foundation often and as late as 2013. Only in 2015 did Liberace Foundation chairman Jonathan Warren reveal in a lecture at the Mob Museum in Las Vegas that these figures were all part of the showmanship of Liberace, and that the real figures were closer to one tenth of those amounts.

The Liberace Foundation saw the sunset of its in-house endowment fund in 2011. University endowment funds provided by it continue to offer scholarships annually. The original Liberace museum closed its doors in 2010, citing the recession and an outdated, outmoded facility.

In November 2013, a dozen of Liberace&#x27;s famous costumes, together with one of his stage cars and a piano went on display for a six-week period at the Cosmopolitan Las Vegas in an exhibition titled &quot;Too Much of a Good Thing Is Wonderful&quot;, Liberace&#x27;s unofficial motto, and an often-used one-liner from his act. The exhibition was extended by seven months.

<text>Krefeld ( , ; ), also spelled Crefeld until 1925 (though the spelling was still being used in British papers throughout the Second World War), is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located northwest of Düsseldorf, its center lying just a few kilometers to the west of the river Rhine; the borough of Uerdingen is situated directly on the Rhine. Because of its economic past, Krefeld is often referred to as the &quot;Velvet and Silk City&quot;. It is accessed by the autobahns A57 (Cologne–Nijmegen) and A44 (Aachen–Düsseldorf–Dortmund–Kassel).

Krefeld&#x27;s residents now speak &#x27;, or standard German, but the native dialect is a [[Low Franconian]] variety, sometimes locally called&#x27;, &#x27;, or sometimes simply&#x27;. The Uerdingen line isogloss, separating general dialectical areas in Germany and neighboring Germanic-speaking countries, runs through and is named after Krefeld&#x27;s Uerdingen district, originally an independent municipality.

==History==
===Early history===
Records first mention Krefeld in 1105 under the name of &quot;Krinvelde&quot;.

In February 1598, Walburga, wife of Adolf van Nieuwenaar, and last Countess of Limburg and Moers, gave the County of Moers, which included Krefeld, to Maurice, Prince of Orange. After her death in 1600, John William of Cleves took possession of these lands, but Maurice successfully defended his heritage in 1601. Krefeld and Moers would remain under the jurisdiction of the House of Orange and the Dutch Republic during the Dutch Golden Age (1588–1672). Krefeld was one of few towns spared the horrors of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648). The town of Uerdingen, incorporated into Krefeld in the 20th century, had been destroyed at the hands of troops from Hesse during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and almost ceased to exist.

After the death of William III of Orange in 1702, Krefeld passed to the Kingdom of Prussia. The Battle of Krefeld occurred nearby in 1758 during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Krefeld and Uerdingen were included within the Prussian Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg in 1815 (after 1822 the Rhine Province).

In 1872 Krefeld became an independent city within Rhenish Prussia. In 1918 during the First World War the Belgian Army used it as a base during the occupation of the Rhineland. In 1929 Krefeld and Uerdingen merged to form Krefeld-Uerdingen; in 1940 the name was shortened to simply &quot;Krefeld&quot;.

=== The Mennonites of Krefeld ===
From 1607 Mennonites arrived in Krefeld, as in nearby Gronau, from neighboring Roman Catholic territories where they were persecuted. In 1609 Herman op den Graeff, originally from Aldekerk, moved with his family to Krefeld. There he became a lay preacher and chairman of the Mennonite religious community. In 1637, Op den Graeff was referred to as “the Mennonite lord Bishop” (der hiesigen Mennoniten Herrn Bischof) of Krefeld in the reformed community’s minutes book. They sought refuge in the lands of the more tolerant House of Orange-Nassau, at the time rulers of Krefeld; in 1657 their congregation was officially recognized and in 1693 they were allowed to build their own church, although hidden in a back yard (which still exists, reconstructed after World War II, with about 800 members). Also the Quaker Evangelists received a sympathetic audience among the larger of the German-Mennonite congregations around Krefeld, Gronau, Emden and Altona, Hamburg. In 1683 a group of thirteen Mennonite families (twelve of them Mennonite-Quakers), the so called Original 13, including three of the Op den Graeff families left Krefeld to re-settle in Pennsylvania in order to enjoy religious freedom. They crossed the Atlantic on the ship &quot;Concord&quot;, and founded the settlement of Germantown (now incorporated in Philadelphia), invited by William Penn, and thus beginning the Pennsylvania Dutch ethnic identity. The most important Mennonite family of Krefeld were the silk merchants and silk weaving industrialists Von der Leyen who, by 1763, employed half of Krefeld&#x27;s population of 6,082 in their factories. Their residence, built from 1791, is the current City Hall.

=== The Jews of Krefeld ===
Jews were listed as citizens of Krefeld from 1617. In 1764, a synagogue was erected, and by 1812, under French rule, the town included 196 Jewish families, with three Jewish-owned banks. Under Napoleon, the town became the capital for the surrounding Jewish communities including over 5000 Jews, and by 1897 they comprised 1.8% of the population. In 1846 a Jewish representative was voted onto the town&#x27;s municipal council, while rising antisemitism was noted during these elections. A reform synagogue was built in 1876, arousing opposition from the Orthodox community. A Jewish school existed in the town, with more than 200 students around 1900.

In November 1938, during the November pogroms, a synagogue on Marktstraße, as well as synagogues in Linn, Uerdingen and Hüls were destroyed, in addition to attacks on Jewish shops and homes. In 1941 following an order from Hitler to deport the German Jews to the east, Jews from the town were sent to the area around Riga and murdered there. 

In 2008, a new synagogue, library and Jewish cultural center were erected on the location of one of the demolished synagogues. Around 1100 Jews were reported to live in and around Krefeld at the time.

===World War II===

On 11 December 1941, during World War II, a detailed report on the transport of Jews from Krefeld and its surroundings listed 1007 Jews from Krefeld and Duisburg, were deported to the Šķirotava Railway Station near Riga, later to become Jungfernhof concentration camp. They were transported in freezing conditions with no drinking water for more than two days. Almost immediately upon arrival, they were shot in the Rumbula forest massacre.

On 21 June 1943, British bombs destroyed many buildings in the east part of the city; a firestorm consumed large parts of the city center (apart from the central train station, which remained intact apart from minor damage). On 3 March 1945 US troops entered Krefeld. After occupying the city and due to a lack of fluent German speakers in the intelligence unit to which he was assigned, the U.S. Army placed Henry Kissinger, then a private, in charge of the city administration.

During the Cold War, the city was host to the 16th Signal Regiment of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Corps of Signals stationed at Bradbury Barracks. The town became part of the new state of North Rhine-Westphalia after World War II.

==Transport==

Krefeld is connected to the Deutsche Bahn network with several stations, including its main station, Krefeld Hauptbahnhof. They are served by Intercity, Regional-Express and Regionalbahn trains. The Düsseldorf-based Rheinbahn operates a Stadtbahn service to the centrally located Rheinstraße stop. This line was the first electric inter-city rail line in Europe, established in 1898, and commonly called the K-Bahn because of the letter &quot;K&quot; used to denote the trains to Krefeld. Nowadays, in the VRR notation, it is called U76, with the morning and afternoon express trains numbered as U70, the line number there coloured red instead of the usual blue used for U-Bahn lines. The term &quot;K-Bahn&quot;, however, prevails in common usage.

The city of Krefeld itself operates four tramway and several bus lines under the umbrella of SWK MOBIL, a city-owned company. Since 2010, 19 of the oldest trams of the type Duewag GT8 were replaced by modern barrier-free trams of the type Bombardier Flexity Outlook. SWK Mobil owns an option to buy another 19 trams of the same type to replace the last 19 Duewag M8 trams. The whole tram fleet will then be barrier-free. Next to that the city plans to extend the line 044 in Krefeld-Hüls to connect the northern district of Hüls with the Krefeld downtown area.

== Economy ==
The headquarters of Fressnapf, a pet food retailer franchise company, are situated in Krefeld.

The Nirosta steelworks, once owned by ThyssenKrupp, was sold in 2012 to Outokumpu.

==International relations==
Since 1964, the city has hosted an &quot;honors program in foreign language (German) studies&quot; for high school students from Indiana, United States. The program annually places approximately thirty carefully selected high school juniors with families in and around Krefeld for intensive German language training. Since 1973, the fire services of Krefeld and twin city Leicester have played each other in an annual &#x27;friendly&#x27; football match.

<text>Norman Kaye Panama (April 21, 1914 – January 13, 2003) was an American screenwriter, film producer and film director. He is known for his partnership with Melvin Frank and their work on films such as &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948), &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), and &quot;The Court Jester&quot; (1956). Without Frank, he directed films such as &quot;How to Commit Marriage&quot; (1969).

==Life and career==
Panama met his future collaborator Melvin Frank in 1933 when they were both at the University of Chicago. After graduating, they formed a partnership in 1935 which endured for four decades; first writing for Milton Berle before becoming writers for Bob Hope&#x27;s radio show and for Groucho Marx. In 1941, they sold their first script to Paramount Pictures, &quot;My Favorite Blonde&quot; (1942), which starred Hope.

They worked for Paramount for five years where, among others, they wrote &quot;Road to Utopia&quot; (1946), starring Hope and Bing Crosby, for which they received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay. They moved to Columbia Pictures making &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Return of October&quot; (1948) and also wrote &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot; (1948) for RKO.

In 1950, they signed a writing, producing and directing deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and made films together as co-writers, co-directors and co-producers. They started with &quot;The Reformer and the Redhead&quot; (1950) and also made &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; (1954) and &quot;The Court Jester&quot; (1956), both with Danny Kaye, with the former earning them another Academy Award nomination. They also co-wrote &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954) with Norman Krasna. They wrote a Broadway play together in 1956, later adapted into &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1959), directed by Frank. They received another Academy Award nomination for &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; (1960) and also worked on &quot;The Road to Hong Kong&quot; (1962).

He won an Edgar Award for &quot;A Talent for Murder&quot; (1981), a play he co-wrote with Jerome Chodorov. Panama continued to write and direct through the 1980s. He died in 2003 in Los Angeles, California, aged 88, from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<doc id="179578" wikidata="Q12612" url="?curid=179578" title="Western United States">
<text>The Western United States (also called the American West, the Western States, the Far West, the Western territories, and the West) is one of the four census regions defined by the United States Census Bureau.

As American settlement in the U.S. expanded westward, the meaning of the term &quot;the West&quot; changed. Before around 1800, the crest of the Appalachian Mountains was seen as the western frontier. The frontier moved westward and eventually the lands west of the Mississippi River were considered &quot;the West&quot;.

The U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s definition of the 13 westernmost states includes the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin to the Pacific Coast, and the mid-Pacific islands state, Hawaii. To the east of the Western United States is the Midwestern United States and the Southern United States, with Canada to the north and Mexico to the south.

The West contains several major biomes, including arid and semi-arid plateaus and plains, particularly in the American Southwest; forested mountains, including three major ranges, the Sierra Nevada, the Cascades, and Rocky Mountains; the long coastal shoreline of the Pacific Coast; and the rainforests of the Pacific Northwest.

==Geographic definition==

The Western United States is the largest region of the country, covering nearly half the land area of the contiguous United States. It is also the most geographically diverse, incorporating geographic regions such as the temperate rainforests of the Northwest, the highest mountain ranges, including the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range, numerous glaciers, and the western edge of the Great Plains. It also contains the majority of the desert areas located in the United States. The Mojave and the Great Basin deserts lie entirely within the Western region, along with parts of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts (the latter extends significantly into Texas, while both extend into Mexico). Given this expansive and diverse geography it is no wonder that the region is difficult to define precisely. Sensing a possible shift in the popular understanding of the West as a region in the early 1990s, historian Walter Nugent conducted a survey of three groups of professionals with ties to the region: a large group of Western historians (187 respondents), and two smaller groups, 25 journalists and publishers and 39 Western authors. A majority of the historian respondents placed the eastern boundary of the West east of the Census definition out on the eastern edge of the Great Plains or on the Mississippi River. The survey respondents as a whole showed just how little agreement there was on the boundaries of the West.

===Subregions===
The region is split into two smaller units or divisions, by the U.S. Census Bureau:

; Mountain states: Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada
; Pacific states: Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, and Hawaii

Other classifications distinguish between Southwest and Northwest. Arizona, New Mexico, West Texas, and the Oklahoma panhandle are typically considered to be the Southwest states. Meanwhile, the states of Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington can be considered part of the Northwest or Pacific Northwest.

The term West Coast is commonly used to refer to just California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska, whereas Hawaii is more geographically isolated from the continental U.S. and does not necessarily fit in any of these subregions.
=== Outlying areas ===

The three inhabited Pacific U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands) are sometimes considered part of the Western United States. American Samoa is in Polynesia in the South Pacific Ocean, while Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are in the Mariana Islands in the western North Pacific Ocean. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands have district courts within the 9th Circuit, which includes western states such as California and Nevada. (See District Court of Guam and District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands). American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands are also considered part of the western U.S. by the U.S. National Park Service, the Federal Reserve Bank system, FEMA, and the USGS.

==Demographics==
The population distribution by race in the Western United States (2022):
* 51.9% White (47.1% non-Hispanic)
* 30.8% Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (of any race)
* 10.8% Asian (10.6% non-Hispanic)
* 4.5% Black or African-American (4.3% non-Hispanic)
* 1.9% American Indian or Alaska Native (1.1% non-Hispanic)
* 0.6% Pacific Islander (0.6% non-Hispanic)
* 13.3% Some other race (0.6% non-Hispanic)
* 17.0% Two or more races (5.0% non-Hispanic)

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, the Western region of the United States includes 13 states, with a total 2020 population of 78,588,572.

The West is one of the most sparsely settled areas in the United States with . Only Texas with , Washington with , and California with exceed the national average of . As of 2022, just under half of the 78.7 million residents of the West live in California. 

The entire Western region has also been strongly influenced by European, Hispanic or Latino, Asian and Native Americans; it contains the largest number of minorities in the U.S. While most of the studies of racial dynamics in America such as riots in Los Angeles have been written about European and African-Americans, in many cities in the West and California, whites and blacks together are less than half the population because of the preference for the region by Hispanics and Asians. African and European Americans, however, continue to wield a stronger political influence because of the lower rates of citizenship and voting among Asians and Hispanics.

According to 2022 estimates from the Census Bureau, the largest ancestries reported in the West are Mexican (24.2%), German (10.1%), English (9.5%), Irish (7.2%), Italian (3.5%), Filipino (3.4%), and Chinese (3.3%).

The West also contains much of the Native American population in the U.S., particularly in the large reservations in the Mountain and Desert States. As of 2022, the West is home to 365,351 Navajo, 109,208 Apache, and 78,364 Blackfeet, as well as 276,082 people identifying as Indigenous Mexican. 

The largest concentrations for African-Americans in the West can be found in San Diego, Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento, Fresno, San Francisco, Seattle, Tacoma, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Denver, and Colorado Springs.

The Western United States has a higher sex ratio (more males than females) than any other region in the United States.

Because the tide of development had not yet reached most of the West when conservation became a national issue, agencies of the federal government own and manage vast areas of land. (The most important among these are the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management within the Interior Department, and the U.S. Forest Service within the Agriculture Department.) National parks are reserved for recreational activities such as fishing, camping, hiking, and boating, but other government lands also allow commercial activities like ranching, logging, and mining. In recent years, some local residents who earn their livelihoods on federal land have come into conflict with the land&#x27;s managers, who are required to keep land use within environmentally acceptable limits.

The largest city in the region is Los Angeles, located on the West Coast. Other West Coast cities include San Diego, San Bernardino, San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, Bakersfield, Fresno, Sacramento, Seattle, Tacoma, Anchorage, and Portland – some of which are dozens of miles inland. Prominent cities in the Mountain States include Denver, Colorado Springs, Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Reno, Salt Lake City, Boise, El Paso, and Billings.

==Natural geography==
Along the Pacific Ocean coast lie the Coast Ranges, which, while not approaching the scale of the Rocky Mountains, are formidable nevertheless. They collect a large part of the airborne moisture moving in from the ocean. East of the Coast Ranges lie several cultivated fertile valleys, notably the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys of California and the Willamette Valley of Oregon.

Beyond the valleys lie the Sierra Nevada in the south and the Cascade Range in the north. Mount Whitney, at the tallest peak in the contiguous 48 states, is in the Sierra Nevada. The Cascades are also volcanic. Mount Rainier, a volcano in Washington, is also over . Mount St. Helens, a volcano in the Cascades, erupted explosively in 1980. A major volcanic eruption at Mount Mazama around 4860 BC formed Crater Lake. These mountain ranges see heavy precipitation, capturing most of the moisture that remains after the Coast Ranges, and creating a rain shadow to the east forming vast stretches of arid land. These dry areas encompass much of Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. The Mojave Desert and Sonoran Desert along with other deserts are found here.

Beyond the deserts lie the Rocky Mountains. In the north, they run almost immediately east of the Cascade Range, so that the desert region is only a few miles wide by the time one reaches the Canada–US border. The Rockies are hundreds of miles wide and run uninterrupted from New Mexico to Alaska. The Rocky Mountain Region is the highest overall area of the United States, with an average elevation of above . The tallest peaks of the Rockies, 54 of which are over , are found in central and western Colorado. East of the Rocky Mountains is the Great Plains, the western portions (for example, the eastern half of Colorado) of which are generally considered to be part of the western United States.

The West has several long rivers that empty into the Pacific Ocean, while the eastern rivers run into the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi River forms the easternmost possible boundary for the West today. The Missouri River, a tributary of the Mississippi, flows from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains eastward across the Great Plains, a vast grassy plateau, before sloping gradually down to the forests and hence to the Mississippi. The Colorado River snakes through the Mountain states, at one point forming the Grand Canyon.

The Colorado River is a major source of water in the Southwest and many dams, such as the Hoover Dam, form reservoirs along it. So much water is drawn for drinking water throughout the West and irrigation in California that in most years, water from the Colorado River no longer reaches the Gulf of California. The Columbia River, the largest river in volume flowing into the Pacific Ocean from North America, and its tributary, the Snake River, water the Pacific Northwest. The Platte runs through Nebraska and was known for being a mile (2 km) wide but only a half-inch (1 cm) deep. The Rio Grande forms the border between Texas and Mexico before turning due north and splitting New Mexico in half.

According to the United States Coast Guard, &quot;The Western Rivers System consists of the Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, Tennessee, Cumberland, Arkansas, and White Rivers and their tributaries, and certain other rivers that flow towards the Gulf of Mexico.&quot; The Ohio River portion of the system includes parts of several Atlantic coastal states, from Georgia to New York.

===Climate and agriculture===
Most of the public land held by the U.S. National Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management is in the Western states. Public lands account for 25 to 75 percent of the total land area in these states.

The climate of the West is semi-arid, yet parts of the region get high amounts of rain or snow. Other parts are true desert which receive less than of rain per year. The climate is increasingly unstable, and subject to periods of severe drought.

The seasonal temperatures vary greatly throughout the West. Low elevations on the West Coast have warm summers and mild winters with little to no snow. The desert southwest has very hot summers and mild winters. While the mountains in the southwest receive generally large amounts of snow. The Inland Northwest has a continental climate of warm to hot summers and cold to bitterly cold winters.

Annual rainfall is greater in the eastern portions, gradually tapering off until reaching the Pacific Coast where it increases again. In fact, the greatest annual rainfall in the United States falls in the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. Drought is much more common in the West than the rest of the United States. The driest place recorded in the U.S. is Death Valley, California. In Western states, drought is closely associated with fire risk, and there have been a number of notable wildfires causing extensive property damage and wildlife habitat destruction. The Western United States is predicted to experience drought-like conditions for much of the 21st century.

Violent thunderstorms occur east of the Rockies. Tornadoes occur every spring on the southern plains, with the most common and most destructive centered on Tornado Alley, which covers eastern portions of the West, (Texas to North Dakota), and all states in between and to the east.

Agriculture varies depending on rainfall, irrigation, soil, elevation, and temperature extremes. The arid regions generally support only livestock grazing, chiefly beef cattle. The &quot;wheat belt&quot; extends from Texas through The Dakotas, producing most of the wheat and soybeans in the U.S. and exporting more to the rest of the world. Irrigation in the Southwest allows the growth of great quantities of fruits, nuts, and vegetables as well as grain, hay, and flowers. Texas is a major cattle and sheep raising area, as well as the nation&#x27;s largest producer of cotton. Washington is famous for its apples, and Idaho for its potatoes. California and Arizona are major producers of citrus crops, however, declining supplies of water, as well as urban sprawl have contributed to a sharp decline in citrus production in Arizona. Many varieties of chile peppers are grown in the valleys of New Mexico.

Starting in 1902, Congress passed a series of acts authorizing the establishment of the United States Bureau of Reclamation to oversee water development projects in seventeen western states.

During the first half of the 20th century, dams and irrigation projects provided water for rapid agricultural growth throughout the West and brought prosperity for several states, where agriculture had previously only been subsistence level. Following World War II, the West&#x27;s cities experienced an economic and population boom. The population growth, mostly in the Southwest states of New Mexico, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada, has strained water and power resources, with water diverted from agricultural uses to major population centers, such as the Las Vegas Valley and Los Angeles.

===Geology===
Plains make up much of the eastern portion of the West, underlain with sedimentary rock from the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. The Rocky Mountains expose igneous and metamorphic rock both from the Precambrian and from the Phanerozoic eon. The Inter-mountain States and Pacific Northwest have huge expanses of volcanic rock from the Cenozoic era. Salt flats and salt lakes reveal a time when the great inland seas covered much of what is now the West.

The Pacific states are the most geologically active areas in the United States. Earthquakes cause damage every few to several years in California. While the Pacific states are the most volcanically active areas, extinct volcanoes and lava flows are found throughout most of the West.

==History==
The Western United States has been populated by Native Americans since at least 11,000 years ago, when the first Paleo-Indians arrived. Pre-Columbian trade routes to kingdoms and empires such as the Mound Builders existed in places such as Yellowstone National Park since around 1000 AD. Major settlement of the western territories developed rapidly in the 1840s, largely through the Oregon Trail and the California Gold Rush of 1849. California experienced such a rapid growth in a few short months that it was admitted to statehood in 1850 without the normal transitory phase of becoming an official territory.

One of the largest migrations in American history occurred in the 1840s as the Latter Day Saints left the Midwest to build a theocracy in Utah.

Both Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis, Missouri laid claim to the title, &quot;Gateway to the West&quot; during this period. Omaha, home to the Union Pacific Railroad and the Mormon Trail, made its fortunes on outfitting settlers; St. Louis built itself upon the vast fur trade in the West before its settlement.

The 1850s were marked by political battles over the expansion of slavery into the western territories, issues leading to the Civil War.

Between 1863 and 1869, North America&#x27;s first transcontinental railroad was constructed to connect the eastern US with the Pacific coast. The resulting railroad connection revolutionized the settlement and economy of the American West by making the transportation of passengers and freight quicker, safer, and cheaper.
The history of the American West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries has acquired a cultural mythos in the literature and cinema of the United States. The image of the cowboy, the homesteader, and westward expansion took real events and transmuted them into a myth of the west which has shaped much of American popular culture since the late 19th century.

Writers as diverse as Bret Harte and Zane Grey celebrated or derided cowboy culture, while artists such as Frederic Remington created western art as a method of recording the expansion into the west. The American cinema, in particular, created the genre of the western movie, which, in many cases, use the West as a metaphor for the virtue of self-reliance and an American ethos. The contrast between the romanticism of culture about the West and the actuality of the history of the westward expansion has been a theme of late 20th and early 21st century scholarship about the West. Cowboy culture has become embedded in the American experience as a common cultural touchstone, and modern forms as diverse as country and western music have celebrated the sense of isolation and independence of spirit inspired by the frontiersmen on &quot;virgin land&quot;.

===20th century===

The advent of the automobile enabled the average American to tour the West. Western businessmen promoted Route 66 as a means to bring tourism and industry to the West. In the 1950s, representatives from all the western states built the Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center to showcase western culture and greet travelers from the East. During the latter half of the 20th century, several transcontinental interstate highways crossed the West bringing more trade and tourists from the East. Oil boom towns in Texas and Oklahoma rivaled the old mining camps for their rawness and wealth. The Dust Bowl forced children of the original homesteaders even further west.

The movies became America&#x27;s chief entertainment source featuring western fiction, later the community of Hollywood in Los Angeles became the headquarters of the mass media such as radio and television production.

California has emerged as the most populous state and one of the top 10 economies in the world. Massive late 19th–20th century population and settlement booms created two megalopolis areas of the Greater Los Angeles/Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area/Northern California regions, one of the nation&#x27;s largest metropolitan areas and in the top 25 largest urban areas in the world. Five more metropolitan areas of San Bernardino-Riverside, San Diego, Denver, Phoenix, and Seattle have over a million residents, while the three fastest growing metro areas were the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the Las Vegas metropolitan area; and the Portland metropolitan area.

Since the mid-1970s, historians of the West have emphasized the World War II years as a major watershed, as a region experienced enormous social and economic change, and became the pacesetter for societal evolution. The population soared, especially in metropolitan areas, as a result of massive expansion of the manufacture of airplanes, ships and munitions and of military and Naval training facilities. California upgraded universities to world-class status, intensified scientific research, and expanded infrastructure. After the war millions more migrated using the GI Bill to buy suburban homes, many of them recalling rewarding wartime experience in military training facilities. The region had always been more democratic with greater racial and gender equality, and continued as a national pacesetter in modernization. New problems emerged, especially environmental issues where westerners took the lead in areas such as the allocation of scarce water resources as well as dealing with smog and air pollution. More recently historians have looked at nuances, pointing out that some of the trends began before 1941.

Los Angeles has the largest Mexican population outside of Mexico, while San Francisco has the largest Chinese community in North America and also has a large LGBT community, and Oakland, California has a large percentage of residents being African-American, as well as Long Beach, California which also has a significant black community. The state of Utah has a Mormon majority (estimated at 62.4% in 2004), while some cities like Albuquerque, New Mexico; Billings, Montana; Spokane, Washington; and Tucson, Arizona are located near Indian reservations. In remote areas there are settlements of Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians.

==Culture==

Historically, the traditional culture of the Western United States has been defined by the cowboys, pioneers, and Native Americans who first inhabited the Wild West. The sparse geography of the western deserts (Mojave Desert, Great Basin Desert) and isolated small towns, combined with the broad freeways (U.S. Route 66) and long railroads (First transcontinental railroad), have contributed to the popular image of the west as a desolate, open space full of unending roads.

Facing both the Pacific Ocean and the Mexican border, the West has been shaped by a variety of ethnic groups. Hawaii is the only state in the union in which Asian Americans outnumber white American residents. People from many countries in Asia settled in California and other coastal states in several waves of immigration since the 19th century, contributing to the Gold rush, the building of the transcontinental railroad, agriculture, and more recently, high technology.

The border states—California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—and other southwestern states such as Colorado, Utah, and Nevada all have large Hispanic populations, and the many Spanish place names attest to their history as former Spanish and Mexican territories. Mexican-Americans have also had a growing population in Northwestern states of Oregon and Washington, as well as the southern states of Texas and Oklahoma.
In the Pacific States, the wide areas filled with small towns, farms, and forests are supplemented by a few big port cities which have evolved into world centers for the media and technology industries. Now the second largest city in the nation, Los Angeles is best known as the home of the Hollywood film industry; the area around Los Angeles also was a major center for the aerospace industry by World War II, though Boeing, located in Washington state would lead the aerospace industry. Fueled by the growth of Los Angeles, as well as the San Francisco Bay area, including Silicon Valley, the center of America&#x27;s high tech industry, California has become the most populous of all the 50 states. Oregon and Washington have also seen rapid growth with the rise of Boeing and Microsoft along with agriculture and resource based industries.

Alaska—the northernmost state in the Union—is a vast land of few people, many of them native, and of great stretches of wilderness, protected in national parks and wildlife refuges. Hawaii&#x27;s location makes it a major gateway between the United States and Asia, as well as a center for tourism.

The Mountain States subregion includes Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. The mountain states have relatively low population densities, and developed as ranching and mining areas that only recently became urbanized. Most of them have highly individualistic cultures, and have worked to balance the interests of urban development, recreation, and the environment.

Culturally distinctive points of the mountain states include the large Mormon population in the Mormon Corridor, including southeastern Idaho, Utah, Northern Arizona, and Nevada; the extravagant casino resort towns of Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada; and the numerous American Indian tribal reservations.

===Sports===
Professional sports leagues such as the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA), National Hockey League (NHL), Major League Soccer (MLS), and National Women&#x27;s Soccer League (NWSL), have team franchises in following cities/metropolitan areas of the region:

* Denver: Avalanche (NHL), Broncos (NFL), Nuggets (NBA), Rapids (MLS), Rockies (MLB)

* West Sacramento: Athletics (MLB) (the team will relocate to Las Vegas in 2027)

==Major metropolitan areas==

These are the largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) with a population above 500,000 in the 13 Western states. Population figures are as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the United States Census Bureau:

===Other population centers===
* The MSA of El Paso, although belonging to Texas, considered part of the Southern United States, it is sometimes also considered part of the Western United States. Its enumerated population in April 2020 was 868,859.
* The largest MSA in Alaska is Anchorage; it has an enumerated population of 398,328, as of April 2020.
* In the outlying areas of the Western United States, the largest population centers are Tafuna in American Samoa; Dededo in Guam; and Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands.

==Politics==

The region&#x27;s distance from historical centers of power in the East, and the celebrated &quot;frontier spirit&quot; of its settlers offer two clichés for explaining the region&#x27;s independent, heterogeneous politics. Historically, the West was the first region to see widespread women&#x27;s suffrage, with women casting votes in Utah and Wyoming as early as 1870, five decades before the 19th Amendment was ratified by the nation. California birthed both the property rights and conservation movements, and spawned such phenomena as the Taxpayer Revolt and the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. It has also produced three presidents: Herbert Hoover, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.

The prevalence of libertarian political attitudes is widespread. For example, the majority of Western states have legalized medicinal marijuana (all but Idaho and Wyoming) and some forms of gambling (except Utah); Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Montana have legalized physician-assisted suicide; most rural counties in Nevada allow licensed brothels, and voters in Alaska, Colorado, Nevada, California, Oregon, and Washington have legalized recreational use of marijuana.

California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Hawaii and New Mexico lean toward the Democratic Party. In recent times, as seen in the 2020 United States presidential election and 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election, Arizona is also beginning to lean towards the Democratic Party as well. San Francisco&#x27;s two main political parties are the Green Party and the Democratic Party. One of the longest-serving Democratic congressional leaders is from the region: former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of California.

Alaska and most Mountain states are more Republican, with Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming being Republican strongholds. The state of Arizona has been won by the Republican presidential candidate in every election except three times since 1948, but in 2020 Arizona voted Democratic. Also, in 2018 and 2020, the GOP lost both U.S. Senate seats in Arizona to the Democrats. The states of Idaho, Utah, and Wyoming have been won by every Republican presidential nominee since 1964.

The state of Nevada is considered a political bellwether, having correctly voted for every president except twice (in 1976 and 2016) since 1912. New Mexico too is considered a bellwether, having voted for the popular vote winner in every presidential election since statehood, except in 1976.

As the fastest-growing demographic group, after Asians, Latinos are hotly contested by both parties. Immigration is an important political issue for this group. Backlash against undocumented immigrants led to the passage of California Proposition 187 in 1994, a ballot initiative which would have denied many public services to them. Association of this proposal with California Republicans, especially incumbent governor Pete Wilson, drove many Hispanic voters to the Democrats.

The following table shows the breakdown of party affiliation of governors, attorneys general, state legislative houses, and U.S. congressional delegation for the Western states, .

==Health==
The Western United States consistently ranks well in health measures. The rate of potentially preventable hospitalizations in the Western United States was consistently lower than other regions from 2005 to 2011. While the proportion of maternal or neonatal hospital stays was higher in the Western United States relative to other regions, the proportion of medical stays in hospitals was lower than in other regions in 2012.

<text>Kshatriya () (from Sanskrit &quot;kṣatra&quot;, &quot;rule, authority&quot;; also called Rajanya) is one of the four varnas (social orders) of Hindu society and is associated with the warrior aristocracy. The Sanskrit term &quot;kṣatriyaḥ&quot; is used in the context of later Vedic society wherein members were organised into four classes: &quot;brahmin&quot;, kshatriya, &quot;vaishya,&quot; and &quot;shudra&quot;.

==History==

===Early Rigvedic tribal monarchy===
The administrative machinery in the Vedic India was headed by a tribal king called a Rajan whose position may or may not have been hereditary. The king may have been elected in a tribal assembly (called Samiti), which included women. The Rajan protected the tribe and cattle; was assisted by a priest; and did not maintain a standing army, though in the later period the rulership appears to have risen as a social class. The concept of the fourfold varna system is not yet recorded.

===Later Vedic period===
The hymn &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; to the &quot;Rigveda&quot; describes the symbolic creation of the four varna-s through cosmic sacrifice (yajña). Some scholars consider the Purusha Sukta to be a late interpolation into the Rigveda based on the neological character of the composition, as compared to the more archaic style of the Vedic literature. Since not all Indians were fully regulated under the varna in the Vedic society, the Purusha Sukta was supposedly composed in order to secure Vedic sanction for the heredity caste scheme. An alternate explanation is that the word &#x27;Shudra&#x27; does not occur anywhere else in the &quot;Rig-veda&quot; except the &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot;, leading some scholars to believe the &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; was a composition of the later Rig-vedic period itself to denote, legitimize and sanctify an oppressive and exploitative class structure that had already come into existence.

Although the &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; uses the term &quot;rajanya&quot;, not &quot;Kshatriya&quot;, it is considered the first instance in the extant Vedic texts where four social classes are mentioned for the first time together. Usage of the term &quot;Rajanya&quot; possibly indicates the &#x27;kinsmen of the Rajan&#x27; (i.e., kinsmen of the ruler) had emerged as a distinct social group then, such that by the end of the Vedic period, the term &quot;rajanya&quot; was replaced by &quot;Kshatriya&quot;; where &quot;rajanya&quot; stresses kinship with the &quot;Rajan&quot; and &quot;Kshatriya&quot; denotes power over a specific domain. The term rajanya unlike the word Kshatriya essentially denoted the status within a lineage. Whereas &quot;Kshatra&quot;, means &quot;ruling; one of the ruling order&quot;.
Jaiswal points out the term &quot;Brahman&quot; rarely occurs in the Rig-veda with the exception of the &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; and may not have been used for the priestly class. Based on the authority of Pāṇini, Patanjali, Kātyāyana and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Jayaswal believes that Rajanya was the name of political people and that the Rajanyas were, therefore, a democracy (with an elected ruler). Some examples were the Andhaka and Vrsni Rajanyas who followed the system of elected rulers. Ram Sharan Sharma details how the central chief was elected by various clan chiefs or lineage chiefs with increasing polarisation between the &quot;rajanya&quot; (aristocracy helping the ruler) and the &quot;vis&quot; (peasants) leading to a distinction between the chiefs as a separate class (&quot;raja, rajanya, kshatra, kshatriya&quot;) on one hand and &quot;vis&quot; (clan peasantry) on the other hand.

The term kshatriya comes from &quot;kshatra&quot; and implies temporal authority and power which was based less on being a successful leader in battle and more on the tangible power of laying claim to sovereignty over a territory, and symbolising ownership over clan lands. This later gave rise to the idea of kingship.

In the period of the Brahmanas (800 BCE to 700 BCE) there was ambiguity in the position of the varna. In the &quot;Panchavimsha Brahmana&quot; (13,4,7), the Rajanya are placed first, followed by Brahmana then Vaishya. In &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana 13.8.3.11&quot;, the Rajanya are placed second. In &quot;Shatapatha Brahmana 1.1.4.12&quot; the order is—Brahmana, Vaishya, Rajanya, Shudra. The order of the Brahmanical tradition—Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra—became fixed from the time of dharmasutras (450 BCE to 100 BCE). The kshatriya were often considered pre-eminent in Buddhist circles. Even among Hindu societies they were sometimes at rivalry with the Brahmins, but they generally acknowledged the superiority of the priestly class. The Kshatriyas also began to question the yajnas of the historical Vedic religion, which led to religious ideas developed in the Upanishads.

=== Hindu Ritual Duties===
The Kshatriyas studied Vedas, gave gifts and performed fire sacrifice.
=== Mahajanapadas ===
The &quot;gaṇa sangha&quot; form of government was an oligarchic republic during the period of the Mahajanapadas (c. 600–300 BCE), that was ruled by Kshatriya clans. However, these kshatriyas did not follow the Vedic religion, and were sometimes called degenerate Kshatriyas or Shudras by Brahmanical sources. The kshatriyas served as representatives in the assembly at the capital, debated various issues put before the assembly. Due to the lack of patronage of Vedic Brahmanism, the kshatriyas of the gana sanghas were often patrons of Buddhism and Jainism. In the Pali canon, Kshatriya is referred as &quot;khattiya&quot;.

In the kingdoms of the Mahajanapadas, the king claimed kshatriya status through the Vedic religion. While kings claimed to be kshatriya, some kings came from non-kshatriya origins.

After the Mahajanapada period, most of the prominent royal dynasties in northern India were not kshatriyas. The Nanda Empire, whose rulers were stated to be shudras, destroyed many kshatriya lineages.

=== Post-Mauryan Kshatriyas ===
After the collapse of the Maurya Empire, numerous clan-based polities in Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan claimed kshatriya status.

The Shakas and Yavanas were considered to be low-status kshatriyas by Brahmin authors.

In the third to fourth centuries CE, kingdoms in the Krishna and Godavari rivers claimed kshatriya status and performed Vedic rituals to legitimate themselves as rulers. During his visit to India in the 7th century, Hieun Tsang noted that &quot;kshatriya&quot; rulers were ruling the kingdoms like Kabul, Kosala, Bhillamala, Maharashtra and Vallabhi.

=== Emergence of &quot;Puranic&quot; Kshatriyas ===
In the era from 300 to 700 CE, new royal dynasties were bestowed kshatriya status by Brahmins by linking them to the kshatriyas of the epics and Puranas. Dynasties began affiliating themselves with the Solar and Lunar dynasties and this gave them legitimation as rulers. In return the newly christened kshatriyas would patronize and reward the Brahmins. The Sanskritic culture of the kshatriyas of this period was heavily influential for later periods and set the style that kshatriyas of later periods appealed to. This process took place both in North India and the Deccan.

=== Modern era ===

Writing in the context of how the jajmani system operated in the 1960s, Pauline Kolenda noted that the &quot;caste function of the Kshatriya is to lead and protect the village, and with conquest to manage their conquered lands. The Kshatriyas do perform these functions today to the extent possible, by distributing food as payments to &quot;kamins&quot; and providing leadership.&quot;

==Symbols==

In rituals, the &quot;nyagrodha&quot; (&quot;Ficus indica&quot; or India fig or banyan tree) &quot;danda&quot;, or staff, is assigned to the kshatriya class, along with a mantra, intended to impart physical vitality or &#x27;ojas&#x27;.

==Lineage==

The Vedas do not mention kshatriya (or varna) of any &quot;vamsha&quot; (lineage). The lineages of the Itihasa-Purana tradition are: the Solar dynasty (Suryavamsha); and the Lunar dynasty (Chandravamsha/Somavamsha).

There are other lineages, such as Agnivanshi (&quot;fire lineage&quot;), in which an eponymous ancestor is claimed from Agni (fire), and Nagavanshi (snake-born), claiming descent from the Nāgas, whose description can be found in scriptures such as Mahabharata.

<doc id="179580" wikidata="Q2071227" url="?curid=179580" title="The Myth of Mental Illness">
<text>The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct is a 1961 book by the psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, in which the author criticizes psychiatry and argues against the concept of mental illness. It received much publicity, and has become a classic, well known as an argument that &quot;mentally ill&quot; is a label which psychiatrists have used against people &quot;disabled by living&quot; rather than truly having a disease.

==Background==
Szasz writes that he became interested in writing &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; in approximately 1950, when, having become established as a psychiatrist, he became convinced that the concept of mental illness was vague and unsatisfactory. He began work on the book in 1954, when he was relieved of the burdens of a full-time psychiatric practice by being called to active duty in the navy. Later in the 1950s, it was rejected by the first publisher to whom Szasz submitted the manuscript. Szasz next sent the manuscript to Paul Hoeber, director of the medical division of Harper &amp; Brothers, who arranged for it to be published.

==Summary==

Szasz argues that it does not make sense to classify psychological problems as diseases or illnesses, and that speaking of &quot;mental illness&quot; involves a logical or conceptual error. In his view, the term &quot;mental illness&quot; is an inappropriate metaphor and there are no true illnesses of the mind. His position has been characterized as involving a rigid distinction between the physical and the mental.

The legitimacy of psychiatry is questioned by Szasz, who compares it to alchemy and astrology, and argues that it offends the values of autonomy and liberty. Szasz believes that the concept of mental illness is not only logically absurd but has harmful consequences: instead of treating cases of ethical or legal deviation as occasions when a person should be taught personal responsibility, attempts are made to &quot;cure&quot; the deviants, for example by giving them tranquilizers. Psychotherapy is regarded by Szasz as useful not to help people recover from illnesses, but to help them &quot;learn about themselves, others, and life.&quot; Discussing Jean-Martin Charcot and hysteria, Szasz argues that hysteria is an emotional problem and that Charcot&#x27;s patients were not really ill.

==Reception==
&quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; received much publicity, quickly became a classic, and made Szasz a prominent figure. The book was reviewed in the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, &quot;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&quot;, &quot;Psychosomatic Medicine&quot;, &quot;Archives of General Psychiatry&quot;, &quot;Clinical Psychology Review&quot;, and &quot;Psychologies&quot;. Published at a vulnerable moment for psychiatry, when Freudian theorizing was just beginning to fall out of favor and the field was trying to become more medically oriented and empirically based, the book provided an intellectual foundation for mental patient advocates and anti-psychiatry activists. It became well known in the mental health professions and was favorably received by those skeptical of modern psychiatry, but placed Szasz in conflict with many doctors. Soon after &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; was published, the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene demanded, in a letter citing the book, that Szasz be dismissed from his university position because he did not accept the concept of mental illness.

The philosopher Karl Popper, in a 1961 letter to Szasz, called the book admirable and fascinating, adding that, &quot;It is a most important book, and it marks a real revolution.&quot; The psychiatrist David Cooper wrote that &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot;, like the psychiatrist R. D. Laing&#x27;s &quot;The Divided Self&quot; (1960), &quot;proved stimulating in the development of [anti-psychiatry]&quot;, though he noted that neither book is itself an anti-psychiatric work. He described Szasz&#x27;s work as &quot;a decisive, carefully documented demystification of psychiatric diagnostic labelling in general.&quot; Socialist author Peter Sedgwick, writing in 1982, commented that in &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot;, Szasz expounded a &quot;game-playing model of social interaction&quot; which is &quot;zestful and insightful&quot; but &quot;neither particularly uncommon nor particularly iconoclastic by the standards of recent social-psychological theorising.&quot; Sedgwick argued that many of Szasz&#x27;s observations are valuable regardless of the validity of Szasz&#x27;s rejection of the concept of mental illness, and could easily be accepted by psychotherapists. Although agreeing with Szasz that the assignation of mental illness could undermine individual responsibility, he noted that this did not constitute an objection to the concept itself.

The philosopher Michael Ruse called Szasz the most forceful proponent of the thesis that mental illness is a myth. However, while sympathetic to Szasz, he considered his case over-stated. Ruse criticized Szasz&#x27;s arguments on several grounds, maintaining that while the concepts of disease and illness were originally applied only to the physiological realm, they can properly be extended to the mind, and there is no logical absurdity involved in doing so. Kenneth Lewes wrote that &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; is the most notable example of the &quot;critique of the institutions of psychiatry and psychoanalysis&quot; that occurred as part of the &quot;general upheaval of values in the 1960s&quot;, though he saw the work as less profound than Michel Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Madness and Civilization&quot; (1961).

The psychiatrist Peter Breggin called &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot; a seminal work. The author Richard Webster described the book as a well known argument against the tendency of psychiatrists to label people who are &quot;disabled by living&quot; as mentally ill. He observed that while some of Szasz&#x27;s arguments are similar to his, he disagreed with Szasz&#x27;s view that hysteria was an emotional problem and that Charcot&#x27;s patients were not genuinely mentally ill. The lawyer Linda Hirshman wrote that while few psychiatrists adopted the views Szasz expounded in &quot;The Myth of Mental Illness&quot;, the book helped to encourage a revision of their diagnostic and therapeutic claims. The historian Lillian Faderman called the book the most notable attack on psychiatry published in the 1960s, adding that &quot;Szasz&#x27;s insights and critiques would prove invaluable to the homophile movement.&quot;

<text>The Wimshurst machine or Wimshurst influence machine is an electrostatic generator, a machine for generating high voltages developed between 1880 and 1883 by British inventor James Wimshurst (1832–1903). 

It has a distinctive appearance with two large contra-rotating discs mounted in a vertical plane, two crossed bars with metallic brushes, and a spark gap formed by two metal spheres.

==Description==
These machines belong to a class of electrostatic generators called influence machines, which separate electric charges through electrostatic induction, or &quot;influence&quot;, not depending on friction for their operation. Earlier machines in this class were developed by Wilhelm Holtz (1865 and 1867), August Toepler (1865), J. Robert Voss (1880), and others. The older machines are less efficient and exhibit an unpredictable tendency to switch their polarity, while the Wimshurst machine has neither defect.

In a Wimshurst machine, the two insulated discs and their metal sectors rotate in opposite directions passing the crossed metal neutralizer bars and their brushes. An imbalance of charges is induced, amplified, and collected by two pairs of brushes or metal combs with points placed near the surfaces of each disc. These collectors are mounted on insulating supports and connected to the output terminals. The positive feedback increases the accumulating charges exponentially until the dielectric breakdown voltage of the air is reached and an electric spark jumps across the gap.

The machine is theoretically not self-starting, meaning that if none of the sectors on the discs has any electrical charge, there is nothing to induce charges on other sectors. In practice, even a small residual charge on any sector is enough to start the process going once the discs start to rotate. The machine will work satisfactorily only in a dry atmosphere. It requires mechanical power to turn the disks against the electric field, and it is this energy that the machine converts into the electric power of the spark. The insulation and size of the machine determine the maximal output voltage that can be reached. The accumulated spark energy can be increased by adding a pair of Leyden jars, an early type of capacitor suitable for high voltages, with the jars’ inner plates independently connected to each of the output terminals and the jars’ outer plates interconnected. A typical Wimshurst machine can produce sparks that are about a third of the disc&#x27;s diameter in length and several tens of microamperes.

Wimshurst machines were used during the 19th century in physics research. They were also occasionally used to generate high voltage to power the first-generation Crookes X-ray tubes during the first two decades of the 20th century, although Holtz machines and induction coils were more commonly used. Today they are used only in science museums and education to demonstrate the principles of electrostatics.

==Operation==
The two contra-rotating insulating discs have an even number of metal sectors stuck onto them. The machine is provided with four small brushes, two on each side of the machine on the neutralizer bars, plus a pair of charge-collection brushes or combs. These are typically mounted along the horizontal and contact the sectors on both front and back discs. They are usually connected to respective Leyden jars. The neutralizer bars that momentarily connect opposite sectors together form the shape of an &quot;X&quot;. The angle of these bars can typically be varied from 30° to the horizontal to 60°. It is essential that the neutralizer bars are angled in such a way that the sectors on the discs connect with the neutralizer bar before reaching the vertical position. For example, if a disc is rotating clockwise when viewed from the front, the neutralizer bar must be angled from top left to bottom right.

Any small charge on either of the two discs suffices to begin the charging process. Suppose, therefore, that the some of the sectors on the front disc ([A] lower chain) are positively charged (red) and that the front disc rotates counter-clockwise (right to left). As the charged sector (moving red square) rotates to the position of the brush on the rear neutralizer bar ([Y] down arrow tip) it induces a polarization of charge on the neutralizer bar ([Y-Y1] upper horizontal black line) attracting negative (green) charge to the sector immediately opposite it ([Y] upper square becoming green) and positive (red) charge on the sector across the disc 180 degrees away ([Y1] upper square becoming red). When this latter positive charge reaches the place where the front neutralizer bar is ([X]) it induces a negative charge on the sector on the front disc ([X] lower square becoming green) and simultaneously a positive (red) charge on the sector on the opposite side of the disc ([X1] becoming red). The positive charges are collected from both sides of the discs at [Z] and [Z] and the negative charges are collected on the other side of the discs (not labelled on the diagram).

The process repeats, with each charge on A inducing charges on B, inducing more charges on A, etc. This process, by itself, will not, however, produce the high voltages which are actually obtained because the charge induced on B will necessarily be smaller than the charge inducing it on A. The exponential increase in voltage is due to the fact that any voltage which appears on the poles of the machine generates an electric field across the machine which contributes enormously to the polarization of the neutralizer bars. Obviously, the bigger the voltage across the poles, the greater the degree of polarization and the faster the machine charges up. In the end, this positive feedback loop is more important than the charge transfer process described above which serves merely to get the process going. The energy generated by the machine is derived from the work done in separating the charges on the sectors from the charges on the polarized neutralizer bars at the time when they break contact.

The ultimate potential difference which can be achieved is limited principally by the maximum voltage which can be sustained across the sectors on the discs between the neutralizer bars (which are always at zero potential) and the poles. This distance is maximised when the neutraliser bars are as near vertical as possible. (Of course, if the bars were actually vertical, the electric field would not polarize them and the machine would cease to work.)

<doc id="179582" wikidata="Q1378081" url="?curid=179582" title="Yucca brevifolia">
<text>Yucca brevifolia (also known as the Joshua tree, yucca palm, tree yucca, and palm tree yucca) is a plant species belonging to the genus &quot;Yucca&quot;. It is tree-like in habit, which is reflected in its common names.

This monocotyledonous tree is native to the arid Southwestern United States, specifically California, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, and northwestern Mexico. It is confined mostly to the Mojave Desert between elevation. It thrives in the open grasslands of Queen Valley and Lost Horse Valley in Joshua Tree National Park. Other regions with a large population of the trees can be found northeast of Kingman, Arizona, in Mohave County; and along U.S. 93 just south of the community of Meadview, Arizona a route which has been designated the Joshua Tree Parkway of Arizona. The trees are also abundant in Saddleback Butte State Park north of Downtown Los Angeles in Los Angeles County&#x27;s Antelope Valley. The common name, Joshua tree, is derived from Christian iconography.

==Taxonomy==
The Joshua tree is called &quot;hunuvat chiy&#x27;a&quot; or &quot;humwichawa&quot; by the indigenous Cahuilla. It is also called &quot;izote de desierto&quot; (Spanish, &quot;desert dagger&quot;). It was first formally described in the botanical literature as &quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot; by George Engelmann in 1871 as part of the Geological Exploration of the 100th meridian (or &quot;Wheeler Survey&quot;).

The name &quot;Joshua tree&quot; is commonly said to have been given by a group of Mormon settlers crossing the Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century: The tree&#x27;s role in guiding them through the desert combined with its unique shape reminded them of a biblical story in which Joshua keeps his hands reached out for an extended period of time to enable the Israelites in their conquest of Canaan (). Further, the shaggy leaves may have provided the appearance of a beard. However, no direct or contemporary attestation of this origin exists, and the name Joshua tree is not recorded until after Mormon contact; moreover, the physical appearance of the Joshua tree more closely resembles a similar story told of Moses.

Ranchers and miners who were contemporaneous with the Mormon immigrants used the trunks and branches as fencing and for fuel for ore-processing steam engines.

In addition to the autonymic subspecies &quot;Y. b.&quot; subsp. &quot;brevifolia&quot;, two other subspecies have been described: &quot;Y. b.&quot; subsp. &quot;herbertii&quot; (Webber&#x27;s yucca or Herbert Joshua tree) and &quot;Y. b.&quot; subsp. &quot;jaegeriana&quot; (the Jaeger Joshua tree or Jaeger&#x27;s Joshua tree or pygmae yucca), though both are sometimes treated as varieties or forms. &quot;Y.b.&quot; subsp. &quot;jaegeriana&quot; has also been treated as its own species.

==Growth and development==
Joshua trees grow quickly for a desert species; new seedlings may grow at an average rate of per year in their first 10 years, then only about per year. The trunk consists of thousands of small fibers and lacks annual growth rings, making determining the tree&#x27;s age difficult. This tree has a top-heavy branch system, and a broad root system, with roots in one case found from the nearest Joshua tree. If it survives the rigors of the desert, it can live for several hundred years. The tallest trees reach about . New plants can grow from seed, but in some populations, new stems grow from underground rhizomes that spread out around the parent tree.

The evergreen leaves are dark green, linear, bayonet-shaped, 15 to 35 cm long, and 7 to 15 mm broad at the base, tapering to a sharp point; they are borne in a dense spiral arrangement at the apex of the stems. The leaf margins are white and serrated.

Flowers typically appear from February to late April, in panicles 30 to 55 cm tall and 30 to 38 cm broad, the individual flowers erect, 4 to 7 cm tall, with six creamy white to green tepals. The tepals are lanceolate and are fused to the middle. The fused pistils are 3 cm tall and the stigma cavity is surrounded by lobes. The semi-fleshy fruit that is produced is green-brown, elliptical, and contains many flat seeds. Joshua trees usually do not branch until after they bloom (though branching may also occur if the growing tip is destroyed by the yucca-boring weevil), and they do not bloom every year. Like most desert plants, their blooming depends on rainfall at the proper time. They also need a winter freeze before they bloom.

Once they bloom, the flowers are pollinated by the yucca moth (&quot;Tegeticula synthetica&quot;), which spreads pollen while laying eggs inside the flower. The larvae feed on the seeds, but enough seeds remain to reproduce. The Joshua tree is also able to actively abort ovaries in which too many eggs have been produced.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Joshua tree is native to the southwestern United States (Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah) and northwestern Mexico. This range mostly coincides with the geographical reach of the Mojave Desert, where it is considered one of the major indicator species for the desert. It occurs at elevations between .

===Conservation status===
Joshua trees are one of the species predicted to have their range reduced and shifted by climate change. Concern remains that they will be eliminated from Joshua Tree National Park, with ecological research suggesting a high probability that their populations will be reduced by 90% of their current range by the end of the 21st century, thus fundamentally transforming the ecosystem of the park. Wildfires, invasive grasses and poor migration patterns for the trees&#x27; seeds are all additional factors in the species&#x27; imperilment. As an example, approximately 13%—or more than 1.3 million Joshua trees—in one of the densest Joshua tree populations in the world in Mojave National Preserve were killed in the Dome Fire in August 2020. Also, concern exists about the ability of the species to migrate to favorable climates due to the extinction of the giant Shasta ground sloth (&quot;Nothrotheriops shastensis&quot;) 13,000 years ago; ground sloth dung has been found to contain Joshua tree leaves, fruits, and seeds, suggesting that the sloths might have been key to the trees&#x27; dispersal. However, ground squirrels are very effective at moving the seeds long distances.

In March 2022, California Department of Fish and Wildlife conducted a status review of the Western Joshua Tree to determine whether to list the species as threatened under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA). The study showed that the largest threat to &quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot; was wildfires, that wildfires were a threat to population density of prone areas but not to the limits of the range itself, that several population studies showed &quot;Yucca brevifolia&quot; was abundant, and that although the southern region of the species&#x27; range has been reduced, the trend is that the northern region has been expanding over the last 11,700 years as the North American ice cap melted, allowing the species to occupy its current range. The studies showing reduced population after fires used aerial photography to document populations which would underreport smaller and thus younger trees, as was noted in the review. The review concluded: Based on the criteria described above, the best scientific information available to the Department at this time indicates that western Joshua tree is not in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its range due to one or more causes, including loss of habitat, change in habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition, or disease, and is not likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of special protection and management efforts required by CESA.

In February 2023, California governor Gavin Newsom&#x27;s administration proposed a budget trailer bill The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act to focus on protecting the climate-threatened species and permitting development in the Southern California desert. The legislation requires conservation plan for this and other species that may be threatened by climate change and would authorize the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to permit taking a western Joshua tree only under certain conditions. The legislation requires a fee of up to $2500 for the removal, relocation or trimming of limbs of a Western Joshua tree, including dead trees and limbs.

This bill was passed by California lawmakers in June 2023 and went into effect on July 10, 2023.

== Uses and cultivation ==
Different forms of the species are cultivated, including smaller plants native from the eastern part of the species range. These smaller plants grow 2.5 m tall and branch when about 1 m tall. Red-shafted flickers make nests in the branches, which are later used by other birds.

Prior to the twentieth century, Native Americans of the Mojave and western Sonoran Desert routinely used several parts of the Joshua tree as food and fiber (Cornett, J.W., 2018, Indian Uses of Desert Plants, Nature Trails Press, Palm Springs, CA). Leaf fibers were occasionally used to bind and manufacture sandals. Root sheaths were woven into baskets to add reddish-brown designs. Fruits were baked or boiled then eaten. Seeds were ground into flour and mixed with flour from other plant species. The flour was moistened with water and the resulting paste was kneaded into cakes and dried.

<text>Sora () is a town and &quot;comune&quot; of Lazio, Italy, in the province of Frosinone. It is built in a plain on the banks of the Liri. This part of the valley is the seat of some important manufacturing, especially of paper mills. The area around Sora is famous for the costumes of its peasants.


==History==
Sora, an ancient Volscian town, was thrice captured by the Romans, in 345, 314, and 305 BCE, before they managed, in 303, by means of a colony 4,000 strong, to confirm its annexation as a Latin colony. In 209, it was one of the colonies that refused further contributions to the war against Hannibal. By the &quot;lex Julia&quot;, it became a municipium, but under Augustus, it was colonized by soldiers of the legio IV Sorana, which had been mainly enrolled there. It belonged technically to &quot;Latium adiectum&quot;.
Located in the &quot;Ducatus Romanus&quot; under the authority of the pope during the early Dark Ages, it was captured by the Lombards of Gisulf I of Benevento in 705.

The castle of &quot;Sorella&quot;, built on the rocky height above the town, was in the Middle Ages a stronghold of some note. In 1229, during the War of the Keys, it submitted to the Papacy and was then sacked by the Emperor Frederick II, its inhabitants hanged. In 1443, King Alfonso of Naples made Sora the seat of an independent Duchy; it was afterwards seized by Pope Pius II, but being restored to the Cantelmi by Pope Sixtus IV, it ultimately passed to the duke Giovanni della Rovere. Against Cesare Borgia, the city was heroically defended by Francesco Maria I della Rovere. It was purchased by Pope Gregory XIII for 11,000 ducats and bestowed under the suzerainty of Gregory&#x27;s son, Giacomo Boncompagni (who was the first duke of Sora of the family).

==Geography==
The distance from Sora to centre of Rome is 115 km; heading in the opposite direction, the downtown area of Naples is 138 km from Sora.

The municipality, located next to Abruzzo, borders with Arpino, Balsorano (AQ), Broccostella, Campoli Appennino, Castelliri, Isola del Liri, Monte San Giovanni Campano, Pescosolido, and Veroli.

==Main sights==
The original cathedral, consecrated by Pope Adrian IV in 1155, was destroyed by the earthquake of 1634.

Above the town on a precipitous rock, elevation , that guards the Liri&#x27;s valley and the entrance to the Abruzzi are remains of polygonal walls; here, possibly, was the citadel of the original Volscian town. Also, remains of medieval fortifications are there.

Among the churches in town are the Sanctuary of the Madonna della Figura and San Silvestro Papa.

<doc id="179592" wikidata="Q2822795" url="?curid=179592" title="Schengen Agreement">
<text>The Schengen Agreement ( , ) is a treaty which led to the creation of Europe&#x27;s Schengen Area, in which internal border checks have largely been abolished. It was signed on 14 June 1985, near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, by five of the ten member states of the then European Economic Community. It proposed measures intended to gradually abolish border checks at the signatories&#x27; common borders, including reduced-speed vehicle checks which allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping, allowing residents in border areas freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, and the harmonisation of visa policies.

In 1990, the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the complete abolition of systematic internal border controls and a common visa policy. The Schengen Area operates very much like a single state for international travel purposes with external border controls for travellers entering and exiting the area, and common visas, but with no internal border controls. It currently consists of 29 European countries covering a population of over 450 million people and an area of 4,595,131 square kilometres (1,774,190 sq mi).

Originally, the Schengen treaties and the rules adopted under them operated independently from the European Union. However, in 1999 they were incorporated into European Union law by the Amsterdam Treaty, while providing opt-outs for the only two EU member states that had remained outside the Area: Ireland and the United Kingdom (which subsequently withdrew from the EU in 2020). Schengen is now a core part of EU law, and all EU member states without an opt-out which have not already joined the Schengen Area are legally obliged to do so when technical requirements have been met. Several non-EU countries are included in the area through special association agreements.

==History==
Free movement of people was a core part of the original Treaty of Rome and, from the early days of the European Economic Community, nationals of EEC member states could travel freely from one member state to another on production of their passports or national identity cards. However, systematic identity controls were still in place at the border between most member states.

Disagreement between member states led to an impasse on the abolition of border controls within the Community, but in 1985 five of the then ten member states – Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany – signed an agreement on the gradual abolition of common border controls. The agreement was signed on the &quot;Princess Marie-Astrid&quot; boat on the river Moselle near the town of Schengen, Luxembourg, where the territories of France, Germany and Luxembourg meet. Three of the signatories, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands, had already abolished common border controls as part of the Benelux Economic Union.
The Schengen Agreement was signed independently of the European Union, in part owing to the lack of consensus amongst EU member states over whether or not the EU had the jurisdiction to abolish border controls, and in part because those ready to implement the idea did not wish to wait for others (at this time there was no enhanced co-operation mechanism). The Agreement provided for harmonisation of visa policies, allowing residents in border areas the freedom to cross borders away from fixed checkpoints, the replacement of passport checks with visual surveillance of vehicles at reduced speed, and vehicle checks that allowed vehicles to cross borders without stopping.

In 1990, the Agreement was supplemented by the Schengen Convention which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy. It was this Convention that created the Schengen Area through the complete abolition of border controls between Schengen member states, common rules on visas, and police and judicial cooperation.

The Schengen Agreement and its implementing Convention were enacted in 1995 only for some signatories, but just over two years later during the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference, all European Union member states except the United Kingdom and Ireland had signed the Agreement. It was during those negotiations, which led to the Amsterdam Treaty, that the incorporation of the &quot;Schengen acquis&quot; into the main body of European Union law was agreed along with opt-outs for Ireland and the United Kingdom (which subsequently withdrew from the EU in 2020), which were to remain outside of the Schengen Area.
In December 1996, two non-EU member states, Norway and Iceland, signed an association agreement with the signatories of the Agreement to become part of the Schengen Area. While this agreement never came into force, both countries did become part of the Schengen Area after concluding similar agreements with the EU. The Schengen Convention itself was not open for signature by non-EU member states. In 2009, Switzerland finalised its official entry to the Schengen Area with the acceptance of an association agreement by popular referendum in 2005.

Now that the Schengen Agreement is part of the &quot;acquis communautaire&quot;, it has, for EU members, lost the status of a treaty, which could only be amended according to its terms. Instead, amendments are made according to the legislative procedure of the EU under EU treaties. Ratification by the former agreement signatory states is not required for altering or repealing some or all of the former Schengen &quot;acquis&quot;. Legal acts setting out the conditions for entry into the Schengen Area are now made by majority vote in the EU&#x27;s legislative bodies. New EU member states do not sign the Schengen Agreement as such, instead being bound to implement the Schengen rules as part of the pre-existing body of EU law, which every new entrant is required to accept.

This situation means that non-EU Schengen member states have few formally binding options to influence the shaping and evolution of Schengen rules; their options are effectively reduced to agreeing or withdrawing from the agreement. However, consultations with affected countries are conducted prior to the adoption of particular new legislation.

In 2016, border controls were temporarily reintroduced in seven Schengen countries (Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, and Sweden) in response to the European migrant crisis.

Portugal reintroduced checks several times along its border with Spain, during the UEFA Euro 2004 championships and when Portugal hosted the NATO 2010 Lisbon summit. Portugal also reintroduced border checks from 10 May 2017 to 14 May 2017, during Pope Francis&#x27;s visit to Fátima, Portugal.

Border controls were reintroduced throughout the area during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 8 December 2022, the Justice and Home Affairs Council voted to admit Croatia to the Schengen Area, effective from 1 January 2023.

On 30 December 2023, the Justice and Home Affairs Council agreed to partially include Bulgaria and Romania in the Schengen Area, with air and maritime border checks lifted from 31 March 2024. On 12 December 2024, the Council decided to lift the remaining border checks at land crossing effective 1 January 2025, making Bulgaria and Romania full members of the Schengen Area. A dog was the first thing to cross the Hungary-Romania border after Romania joined.

<doc id="179593" wikidata="Q3036205" url="?curid=179593" title="Saint Louis Zoo">
<text>The Saint Louis Zoo, officially known as the Saint Louis Zoological Park, is a zoo in Forest Park in St. Louis, Missouri. It is recognized as a leading zoo in animal management, research, conservation, and education. The zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Admission is free based on a public subsidy from a cultural tax district, the Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District (ZMD); fees are charged for some special attractions. A special feature is the narrow-gauge Emerson Zooline Railroad with passenger trains pulled by Chance Rides &quot;C.P. Huntington&quot; locomotives that encircle the zoo, stopping at the more popular attractions.

The city purchased its first exhibit, the Flight Cage, from the Smithsonian Institution following the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. After the zoo was established in 1910, new exhibits, areas, and buildings were added through the decades to improve care of the animals, the range of animals and habitats shown, and education and interpretation. The head of the male lesser kudu, with his elegant spiraled horns, is the symbol of the Saint Louis Zoo.

In September 2017, the Saint Louis Zoo teamed up with the Missouri Botanical Garden and Washington University in St. Louis in a conservation effort known as the Living Earth Collaborative. The collaborative, run by Washington University scientist Jonathan Losos, seeks to promote further understanding of the ways humans can help to preserve the varied natural environments that allow plants, animals, and microbes to survive and thrive. Some of their other ongoing conservation efforts include the #byetobags movement, encouraging the use of reusable bags, and their turtle-tracking program, which tracks location, population, and health of the box turtle population of Forest Park.

In 2017 and 2018, the zoo was chosen by &quot;USA Today&quot; as the best in the United States.

==History==

===The early years===

The 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair is credited for the birth of the Saint Louis Zoo. The fair brought the world&#x27;s attention to St. Louis and Forest Park. The Smithsonian Institution constructed a walk-through aviary for the World&#x27;s Fair. Ten days after the World&#x27;s Fair closed, the citizens of St. Louis chose to buy the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair Flight Cage for $3,500, rather than have it dismantled and returned to Washington, DC. This was the first piece of what would become the Saint Louis Zoo.

By 1910, increased interest in a zoo brought together some concerned citizens, and they organized the Zoological Society of St. Louis. In 1914, it was incorporated as an independent civic organization of people interested in a zoo. Meanwhile, the citizens of St. Louis and surrounding municipalities expressed diverse opinions as to the appropriate location of a zoo if there should be one. Fairground Park, Carondolet Park, the Creve Coeur area, and Tower Grove Park were some of the places suggested in newspaper articles and letters to the editors and to civic groups. Some concerned citizens residing near Oakland Avenue, south of Forest Park, expressed their displeasure with a zoo in the park because of the smell of the animals.

The zoo initially held 51 deer and antelope, 11 buffaloes, a sacred cow, a sandhill crane, 20 prairie dogs, a dromedary camel, eagles, ducks, elk, foxes, geese, swans, rabbits, a raccoon, a China sheep, opossums, a buzzard, owls, and peafowl, among other animals. The head of the Parks Department, Dwight Davis, voiced his opinion against Forest Park—that is, until the city set aside in the park in which to establish a zoological park. A five-man board was appointed to act as the Zoological Board of Control.

The number of board members was increased to nine in 1916, the same year the citizens voted to create a tax for the construction of the Saint Louis Zoo, with a 1/5 mill tax. This was said to have been the first zoo in the world that the citizens of a community supported by passing a millage tax.

===1920 through 1969===

Expansion of the zoo started in 1921, when the Bear Pits were built. The zoo continued to expand with construction of the Primate House in 1923 and the Reptile House in 1927.

The new Bird House was built in 1930. With the coming of the Great Depression, revenues were down and construction of new exhibits slowed at the zoo. In 1935, the Antelope House was built with the help of the Civil Works Administration, a program of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. This burst of construction ended in 1939 with the addition of the Ape House. In 1939, the zoo acquired two giant pandas. Their names were Happy and Pao Pei. Happy died in 1945 and Pao Pei in 1952.

The Stupp Memorial Pheasantry and the lion arena, now the Sea Lion Arena, were built in 1954. Three years later, the Elephant House and its arena and moated yards were constructed.

Major construction started on the zoo again in 1971 when the Aquatic House was built. It continued with the opening of the Emerson Zooline Railroad in 1963, the Charles H. Yalem Children&#x27;s Zoo, and the animal nursery in 1969.

===1971 through present===

In 1972, the zoo joined the Metropolitan Zoological Park and Museum District and began to receive revenue from a public property tax of 8 cents for every $100 assessed. This enabled continued improvements and upgrades of exhibit areas. Two major areas of the zoo, Big Cat Country and Jungle of the Apes, were constructed in 1976 and 1986, respectively.
In 1989, the Living World, a two-story building including classrooms, a reference library and teacher resource center, an auditorium, two exhibit halls emphasizing evolution and ecology, a large gift shop, a restaurant, and offices was built. It was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum.

In 1993, the zoo received a donation of the Sears Lehmann farm, located west of St. Louis. It is to be used for the breeding of endangered species and educational purposes.

In 1998, new areas were added with the Emerson Children&#x27;s Zoo. Phase I of River&#x27;s Edge, which opened in 1999, represented Asia: featuring Asian elephants, cheetahs, dwarf mongoose, and hyenas.
In 2000, the Monsanto Insectarium, now called the Bayer Insectarium, including the Butterfly House, was built. The North America (Missouri and Mississippi Rivers) portion of River&#x27;s Edge opened in 2001. In 2002, the third phase, featuring habitats of South America and Africa, opened with hippos, rhinos, warthogs, carmine bee-eaters, capybaras, and giant anteaters.

In 2003, the Penguin and Puffin Coast opened with both outdoor and indoor exhibits. Also new that year was the Mary Ann Lee Conservation Carousel, featuring unique hand-carved wooden animals representing endangered species at the Saint Louis Zoo. The Donn and Marilyn Lipton Fragile Forest opened in 2005. Caribbean Cove, which features stingrays, opened in 2008.
In 2010, the zoo started &quot;The Living Promise Campaign&quot;, a project that promised to raise $120 million to improve the zoo. In 2015, the zoo opened Polar Bear Point, a $16 million facility that includes different landscapes and exhibits about the polar bear&#x27;s relationship with the Arctic ecosystem. Its first resident is named Kali, an orphaned polar bear donated to the zoo by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In 2017, the zoo added Centene Grizzly Ridge, an $11.1 million, 7,000 sq ft state-of-the-art habitat that replaced the bear grottoes built in 1921, which were used until 2015 when they were closed for the construction of Grizzly Ridge. Grizzly Ridge opened 15 September 2017 and is now home to two orphaned grizzlies from Montana. Huckleberry, or Huck, and his sister Finley were given to the zoo by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. By the end of the project in 2014, the zoo had exceeded this goal by $14 million, which funded not only Grizzly Ridge or Polar Bear Point, but also Sea Lion Sound (a new and improved way of viewing the sea lions, including a walk-through tunnel), and improvements to other areas of the zoo such as Peabody Hall and River&#x27;s Edge, among others.

The most recent update to the zoo is the addition of the Michael and Quirsis Riney Primate Canopy Trails, a $13 million, 35,000 sq ft state-of-the-art outdoor exhibit for the zoo&#x27;s primates. Primate Canopy Trails opened 12 July 2021 and is connected to the nearby Primate House built in 1925. It replaced some of the outside primate habitats connected to the Primate House.

In 2013, the Saint Louis Zoo began a massive expansion of facilities and space for both visitors and staff. Most notable is a new development planned on 13.5 acres on the grounds of the former Forest Park Hospital, across Interstate 64 from the zoo campus. Once completed, the new facility would feature offices and classrooms, year-round exhibits, a mixed-use development that will link the complex with the adjacent Dogtown neighborhood, and an &quot;iconic&quot; connection of the two sites over Interstate 64. Most importantly, it was to shift all parking to the hospital site, freeing up roughly nine acres currently used as a surface lot for additional exhibits. In June 2022, a five-year-old eastern black rhinoceros named Moyo was permanently transferred to Alabama&#x27;s Birmingham Zoo to eventually develop his own family. Unfortunately in late January 2024, Moyo suffered severe complications after a dental procedure. The zookeepers euthanized him afterwards. 

The St. Louis Zoo is currently developing a second campus in north St. Louis County, with a target opening date of 2027. This $230 million, 425-acre campus will be called the St. Louis Zoo Wildcare Park and focus on endangered ungulate species and enormous habitats. The proposed initial list of animals includes Giraffe, Grevy&#x27;s zebra, Greater kudu, Addax, Bongo, Roan antelope, Somali wild ass, Przewalski&#x27;s horse, Scimitar-horned oryx, Waterbuck, Nile lechwe, Banteng, various Gazelle species, Southern white rhinoceros, Eland, Sable antelope, Bactrian camel, and Ostrich. Proposed attractions include safari rides, an observation tower, glamping, and a museum.

In March 2023, the St. Louis Zoo unveiled its first electric &quot;C.P. Huntington&quot; locomotive, named after Mary Meachum. The Emerson Zooline Railroad will eventually replace its remaining diesel-powered locomotives with the electric model.

===Zoo directors===

The following people have served as directors of the zoo:
* George P. Vierheller (1922–1962)
* R. Marlin Perkins (1962–1970), who gained fame for the zoo as host of &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot;
* William J. Hoff (1970–1973)
* Robert T. Briggs (1973–1975)
* Richard D. Schultz (1975–1982)
* Charles H. Hoessle (1982–2002)
* Dr. Jeffrey P. Bonner (2002–2022)
* Dwight Scott (2022 to present)

==Park zones==

The Saint Louis Zoo is divided into six zones: Lakeside Crossing, River&#x27;s Edge, The Wild, Discovery Corner, Historic Hill, and Red Rocks.

===Lakeside Crossing===
Located in the center of the zoo, Lakeside Crossing has a variety of food services and shopping destinations, and a grassy plaza where visitors can sit and relax. Also featured here are Caribbean Cove and Sea Lion Sound. Caribbean Cove is a shallow touch pool underneath a large pavilion that features the cownose ray, Southern stingray, bonnethead sharks, and bamboo shark. Open during the warmer months, it is one of the only parts of the zoo requiring an admission price. Sea Lion Sound is home to the California sea lion and harbor seal and features an underwater viewing tunnel that allows visitors to see animals swimming around.

===River&#x27;s Edge===

River&#x27;s Edge is home to a variety of animals represented from four continents: North America, Africa (Savannah and Nile), and Asia. The North America exhibit features fish and wildlife from the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers containing Bigmouth buffalo fish, spotted gar, and spotted tilapia. 

The African Savanna exhibit displays eastern black rhinoceroses, the African painted dog, black rhinoceros, and red river hog. The African Nile exhibit features the cheetah, dwarf mongoose, hippopotamus, and spotted hyena. The Asia exhibit features the Asian elephant and Malayan sun bear.

===Discovery Corner===
Discovery Corner is home to the Bayer Insectarium, where most of the zoo&#x27;s invertebrates are found. Represented species include leafcutter ant, flower mantis, Vietnamese walking stick, Atlas beetle, American burying beetle, sunburst diving beetle, water scorpion, brown widow spider, brown recluse spider, yellow garden spiders, &quot;Platymeris biguttatus&quot;, cobalt blue tarantula, Texas brown tarantula, and Egyptian fattail scorpion.

Until 2021, Discovery Corner also included the Emerson Children&#x27;s Zoo, which had many educational features, such as the see-through slide through the otter pool and many birds, snakes, frogs, and other animals that volunteers and staff bring out for the kids to see up close. As of March 2016, the zoo has Tasmanian devils in this section. The Children&#x27;s Zoo closed in 2021 and was temporarily replaced with Dinoroarus, a walking path featuring several animatronic dinosaurs, a gift shop, and a small aquarium. Dinoroarus closed in early 2024 to make way for the Children&#x27;s Zoo&#x27;s permanent successor, the Henry A. Jubel Foundation Destination Discovery, which began construction by October 2024, slated for a 2026 opening date.

===The Wild===
The Wild is home to Grizzly Ridge, McDonnell Polar Bear Point, Fragile Forest, Jungle of the Apes, and Penguin and Puffin Coast. 

McDonnell Polar Bear Point features a polar bear called Kali. Two grizzly bears named Huck and Finn arrived for the opening of Grizzly Ridge in 2017. 

The Fragile Forest features Western lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, and Sumatran orangutan in a naturalized outdoor setting. In colder weather, the apes are free to move into the connected Jungle of the Apes, where guests are able to view them indoors. 

Penguin and Puffin Coast displays a variety of water birds including the gentoo penguin, horned puffin, Humboldt penguin, king penguin, Southern rockhopper penguin, and tufted puffin. 

The red panda and black-tailed prairie dog are also displayed in The Wild.

===Historic Hill===
Historic Hill contains the Bird House, Bird Garden, Herpetarium, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, Primate House, and Primate Canopy Trails. The Bird House features birds as varied as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, congo peafowl, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures.

The Herpetarium houses most of the zoo&#x27;s reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord&#x27;s box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, pancake tortoise, and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world.

In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and is still one of the world&#x27;s largest free-flight aviaries at long, wide, and high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found in the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House and Primate Canopy Trails is home to the zoo&#x27;s monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey, Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka, cotton-top tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, mongoose lemur, ring-tailed lemur, spectacled langur, and white-faced saki. Primates have some freedom to move between indoor and outdoor enclosures as they prefer.

===Red Rocks===
Red Rocks features Big Cat Country and Antelope Habitats.

Big Cat Country is home to several species of big cats. Species featured here are the African lion, Amur leopard, Amur tiger, jaguar, puma, and snow leopard.

The species present at Antelope Habitats are the addax, babirusa, Bactrian camel, banteng, Central Chinese goral, Grévy&#x27;s zebra, lesser kudu, Nile lechwe, okapi, reticulated giraffe, Sichuan takin, Soemmerring&#x27;s gazelle, Somali wild ass, Speke&#x27;s gazelle, and Transcapsian urial. Non-ungulates found in Antelope Habitats include the red kangaroo as well as several birds in mixed-exhibits with the ungulates, such as the East African crowned crane, saddle-billed stork, and Sarus crane.

<doc id="179595" wikidata="Q4887448" url="?curid=179595" title="Benefit of clergy">
<text>In English law, the benefit of clergy (Law Latin: &quot;privilegium clericale&quot;) was originally a provision by which clergymen accused of a crime could claim that they were outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts and be tried instead in an ecclesiastical court under canon law. The ecclesiastical courts were generally seen as being more lenient in their prosecutions and punishments, and defendants made many efforts to claim clergy status, often on questionable or fraudulent grounds.

Various reforms limited the scope of this legal arrangement to prevent its abuse, including branding of a thumb upon first use, to limit the number of invocations for some. Eventually, the benefit of clergy evolved into a legal fiction in which first-time offenders could receive lesser sentences for some crimes (the so-called &quot;clergyable&quot; ones). The legal mechanism was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1827 with the passage of the Criminal Law Act 1827.

== Origin ==
When the Roman Empire converted to Christianity, its emperors issued legal privileges to clerics, particularly bishops, granting them immunity from civic prosecution. In the early Middle Ages, canon law tended to extend the degree of this privilege, even including criminal matters. In England, this tradition was only partially accepted. Before the 12th century, traditional English law courts had been jointly presided over by a bishop and a local secular magistrate. 

In 1164, however, Henry II promulgated the Constitutions of Clarendon, which established a new system of courts that rendered decisions wholly by royal authority. The Assizes touched off a power struggle between the king and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. Becket asserted that these secular courts had no jurisdiction over clergy members because it was the privilege of clergy not to be accused or tried for crime except before an ecclesiastical court. After four of Henry&#x27;s knights murdered Becket in 1170, public sentiment turned against the king, forcing him to make amends with the church. As part of the Compromise of Avranches, Henry was purged of any guilt in Becket&#x27;s murder. Still, he agreed that the secular courts, with few exceptions (high treason being one of them, and forest law another), had no jurisdiction over the clergy.

== The Miserere ==
At first, to plead the benefit of clergy, one had to appear before the court tonsured and otherwise wear an ecclesiastical dress. Over time, this proof of clergyhood was replaced by a literacy test: defendants demonstrated their clerical status by reading from the Latin Bible. This opened the door to literate lay defendants also claiming the benefit of clergy. In 1351, under Edward III, this loophole was formalised in statute, and the benefit of clergy was officially extended to all who could read. For example, the English dramatist Ben Jonson avoided hanging by pleading benefit of clergy in 1598 when charged with manslaughter. In the British colony of Massachusetts, the two soldiers convicted of manslaughter in the 1770 Boston Massacre were spared execution under the benefit of clergy. Still, they underwent branding of their right thumbs to prevent them from invoking the right in any future murder case (see Tudor reforms below).

Unofficially, the loophole was even larger because the Biblical passage traditionally used for the literacy test was, appropriately, the third verse of Psalm 51 (Psalm 50 according to the Vulgate and Septuagint numbering), &quot;Miserere mei, Deus, secundum misericordiam tuam&quot; (&quot;O God, have mercy upon me, according to thine heartfelt mercifulness&quot;). Thus, an illiterate person who had memorized the appropriate Psalm could also claim the benefit of clergy. Psalm 51:3 became known as the &quot;neck verse&quot; because knowing it could &quot;save one&#x27;s neck&quot; (an idiom for &quot;save one&#x27;s life&quot;) by transferring the case from a secular court, where hanging was a likely sentence, to an ecclesiastical court, where both the methods of trial and the sentences given were more lenient.

The benefit of clergy was commonly applied as a means of judicial mercy: in Elizabethan England, courts might allow more than 90% of clergyable offenders the benefit of clergy, which was far higher than the literacy rate of the period. If a defendant who claimed the benefit of clergy were thought to be particularly deserving of death, courts occasionally would ask him to read a different passage from the Bible; if, like most defendants, he was illiterate and simply had memorized Psalm 51, he would be unable to do so and would be put to death.

In the ecclesiastical courts, the most common form of trial was by compurgation. If the defendant swore an oath to his innocence and found twelve &quot;compurgators&quot; to swear likewise to their belief that the accused was innocent, he was acquitted. A person convicted by an ecclesiastical court could be defrocked and returned to the secular authorities for punishment. Still, the English ecclesiastical courts became increasingly lenient, and by the 15th century, most convictions in these courts led to a sentence of penance.

== Tudor-era reforms ==
As a result of this leniency in the ecclesiastical courts, many reforms were undertaken to combat the abuse of the benefit of clergy. In 1488, Henry VII decreed that non-clergymen should be allowed to plead the benefit of clergy only once: those claiming the benefit of clergy but not able to prove through documentation of their holy orders that they were clergy members, were branded on the thumb, and the brand disqualified them from pleading the benefit of clergy in the future. (In 1547, the privilege of claiming the benefit of clergy more than once was extended to peers of the realm, even illiterate ones.) 

In 1512, Henry VIII further restricted the benefit of clergy by making certain offences &quot;unclergyable&quot; offences; in the words of the statutes, they were &quot;felonies without benefit of clergy&quot;. This restriction was condemned by Pope Leo X at the Fifth Lateran Council in 1514. The resulting controversy (in which both the Lord Chief Justice and the Archbishop of Canterbury became involved) was one of the issues that would lead to Henry VIII splitting the Church of England from the Catholic Church in 1532.

The 1512 statute limited the availability of benefit of clergy for murders and felonies committed &quot;of and upon malice prepensed&quot;. A 1530 statute allowed the benefit of clergy a second time only if the second conviction was for &quot;manslaughter by chance medley, and not murder of malice prepensed&quot; but barred it for &quot;petit treason, murder or felony&quot;. By the end of the 16th century, the list of unclergyable offences included murder, rape, poisoning, petty treason, sacrilege, witchcraft, burglary, theft from churches, and pickpocketing. In 1533 benefit of clergy was withdrawn from those who refused to enter a plea.

In 1575, a statute of Elizabeth I radically changed the effect of the benefit of clergy. Whereas before the benefit was pleaded before a trial to have the case transferred to an ecclesiastical court, under the new system, the benefit of clergy was pleaded after conviction but before sentencing. It did not nullify the conviction but instead changed the sentence for first-time offenders from probable hanging to branding and up to a year&#x27;s incarceration.

== Later development ==

By this point, the benefit of clergy had been transformed from a privilege of ecclesiastical jurisdiction to a mechanism by which first-time offenders could obtain partial clemency for some crimes. Legislation in the 17th and 18th centuries increased the number of defendants who could plead the benefit of clergy but decreased the benefit of doing so.

Women acquired the benefit of clergy in 1624, although it was not until 1691 that they were given equal privileges with men. (For example, before 1691, women could plead the benefit of clergy if convicted of theft of goods valued less than 10 shillings, while men could plead clergy for thefts up to 40 shillings.) In the opinion of many contemporary legal scholars, a Jew who had not renounced Judaism could not claim the benefit of clergy.

In 1706, the reading test was abolished, and the benefit became available to all first-time offenders of lesser felonies. Meanwhile, an increasing crime rate prompted Parliament to exclude many seemingly minor property crimes from the benefit of clergy. Eventually, housebreaking, shoplifting goods worth more than 5 shillings, and the theft of sheep and cattle all became felonies without the benefit of clergy. They earned their perpetrator&#x27;s automatic death sentences under the so-called &quot;Bloody Code&quot;. Judges retained the discretion to ask the accused to read a text other than Psalm 51, where they suspected the privilege was being abused.

When the literacy test was abolished in 1706, the lesser sentence given to those who pleaded benefit of clergy was increased to up to 6–24 months&#x27; hard labour. Under the Transportation Act 1718, those who pleaded benefit of clergy could be sentenced to seven years&#x27; banishment to North America. The American Revolution (1775–1783) disrupted the application of this punishment (although two of the British soldiers convicted for their roles in the 1770 Boston Massacre made use of the benefit of clergy to receive reduced punishments). With the abolition of branding in 1779, the benefit of clergy was no longer an option in most cases. Although transportation shifted to Australia, this came to be done using straightforward sentences of transportation for a term of years or for life.

The benefit of clergy was abolished in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by two acts in 1823, and Parliament formally abolished the benefit of clergy with the Criminal Law Act 1827. There was some doubt as to the efficacy of this act, and a final act was passed in 1841, removing all doubt (statute 4th and 5th Vict. c. 22, 2 June 1841).

In the United States, section 31 of the Crimes Act of 1790 eliminated the benefit from federal courts in capital cases, but it survived well into the mid-19th century in some state courts (for example, South Carolina granted a defendant benefit of clergy in 1855, and the state&#x27;s Confederate Constitution forbade the benefit in cases of treason). Many states and counties have abolished the clergy benefits by proclamation, statute, or judicial decision; in others, it simply has fallen into disuse without formal abolition. Rhode Island, however, did not abolish it until 2013, along with deodands, and the distinction between petit treason and murder.

<doc id="179596" wikidata="Q786526" url="?curid=179596" title="T. C. Boyle">
<text>Thomas Coraghessan Boyle (born December 2, 1948) is an American novelist and short story writer. Since the mid-1970s, he has published nineteen novels and more than 150 short stories. He won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1988, for his third novel, &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;, which recounts 300 years in upstate New York.

He was previously a Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Southern California.

==Early life==
T.C. Boyle was born &quot;Thomas John Boyle&quot;, the son of Thomas John Boyle, a school bus driver, and his wife Rosemary Post Boyle (later Rosemary Murphy), a school secretary. He grew up in Peekskill, New York and changed his middle name to Coraghessan when he was 17 after an ancestor of his mother. He received a B.A. in English and History from the State University of New York at Potsdam (1968), an M.F.A. (1974) from the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop, and a Ph.D. (1977) from the University of Iowa.

==Literary characteristics==
In &quot;Understanding T. C. Boyle&quot;, Paul William Gleason writes, &quot;Boyle&#x27;s stories and novels take the best elements of Carver&#x27;s minimalism, Barth&#x27;s postmodern extravaganzas, García Márquez&#x27;s magical realism, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s dark comedy and moral seriousness, and Dickens&#x27; entertaining and strange plots and brings them to bear on American life in an accessible, subversive, and inventive way.&quot;

Many of Boyle&#x27;s novels and short stories explore the baby boom generation, its appetites, joys, and addictions. His themes, such as the often-misguided efforts of the male hero and the slick appeal of the anti-hero, appear alongside brutal satire, humor, and magical realism. His fiction also explores the ruthlessness and the unpredictability of nature and the toll human society unwittingly takes on the environment. 

Boyle has published eleven collections of short stories, including &quot;Descent of Man&quot; (1979), &quot;Greasy Lake&quot; (1985), &quot;If the River Was Whiskey&quot; (1989), and &quot;Without a Hero&quot; (1994). His short stories frequently appear in the major American magazines, including &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;, as well as on the radio show &quot;Selected Shorts&quot;.

==Influences==
Boyle has said Gabriel García Márquez is his favorite novelist. He is also a fan of Flannery O&#x27;Connor and Robert Coover.

== Personal life ==
Boyle is married to Karen Kvashay. They have three children and live in Montecito near Santa Barbara, California. Their home was imperiled in the 2017 Thomas Fire which consumed 440 square miles and over 1,000 structures in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, killing a firefighter in the latter. The fires denuded drought-stricken hillsides of vegetation and torrential rains in January 2018 subsequently dislodged immense boulders and precipitated mudslides which destroyed over one hundred homes and killed almost two dozen of his neighbors. Over 10,000 people were evacuated from Montecito as a result of the sequence of natural disasters. Boyle extensively documented both calamities on his website, and additionally in an article for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

<doc id="179597" wikidata="Q244696" url="?curid=179597" title="Peso">
<text>The peso is the monetary unit of several Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, as well as the Philippines. Originating in the Spanish Empire, the word translates to &quot;weight&quot;. In most countries of the Americas, the symbol commonly known as dollar sign, &quot;$&quot;, was originally used as an abbreviation of &quot;pesos&quot; and later adopted by the dollar. The dollar itself actually originated from the peso or Spanish dollar in the late 18th century. The sign &quot;₱&quot; is used in the Philippines.

The silver &quot;peso&quot; worth eight &quot;reales&quot; was also known in English as a Spanish dollar or &quot;piece of eight&quot; and was widely used for international trade from the 16th to the 19th century.

==Origin and history==

===1537–1686 piece of eight===
The name &quot;peso&quot; was given to the 8-real silver coin introduced in 1497, minted at 8 pesos to a Castilian mark (230.0465 grams) of silver 134/144 fine (25.56 g fine silver). It was minted in large quantities after the discovery of silver in Mexico, Peru and Bolivia in the 16th century, and immediately became a coin of worldwide importance in international trade between Europe, Asia and North America.

Initially the peso was produced in Spanish Latin America in a rapid and simplified manner by cutting off a lump of silver of proper weight and fineness from the end of a silver bar, which was then flattened out and impressed by a hammer. This resulted in a crude, irregular coin called a &quot;cob&quot; in English and &quot;macuquina&quot; in Spanish. The Crown was entitled to a fifth of all gold and silver mined, the &quot;quinto real&quot; (royal fifth), and cobs were a convenient means of handling and accounting for silver. In most cases these cobs were immediately melted down by the recipient. However, some remained in circulation as currency; they were ideal candidates for clipping and counterfeiting due to their irregular shape and incomplete design.

Spanish laws of 1728 and 1730 ordered the mechanization of the minting of the peso so that they would be perfectly round and have milled edges. There was a simultaneous reduction in weight and fineness to 8.5 pesos to a mark (27.064 g), 0.9167 fine or 24.809 g fine silver. This new peso became even more popular in international trade, with recipients finding it more advantageous to trade it as coined silver of known value rather than melting it into silver bullion.Later it was reduced even more.

This coin was known to English colonists in North America as a &quot;piece of eight&quot;, then later on as a &quot;Spanish dollar&quot;, &quot;Spanish milled dollar&quot;, and finally as a &quot;Mexican dollar&quot;. In French, it was called a &quot;piastre&quot; and in Portuguese, a &quot;pataca&quot; or &quot;patacão&quot;. The Spanish names at various times and in various places were &quot;real de a ocho&quot;, &quot;patacón&quot;, &quot;duro&quot;, or &quot;fuerte&quot;.

A final alteration in 1772 further reduced the fineness of the peso from 11/12 fine to 130/144 = 0.9028 (fine silver 24.443 g). A sample of coins at the end of the 18th century, however, confirm a fineness of only 0.896 (hence, fine silver 24.25 g); see Currency of Spanish America. The weight of the United States dollar was defined in 1788 as 371.25 grains of fine silver (or 24.057 g) based on the average silver content of worn peso coins. The full 0.9028 fineness was restored by Mexico after its independence in 1821.

===In Spain===
While the relationship of = (or peso duro) continued in the Americas until the 19th century, Spain struggled with the issuance of &quot;reales de vellon&quot; (made of billon alloy with less than ½ silver) of various weights and finenesses starting in 1600 due to its domestic financial and monetary problems.

In 1642, it first recognized a new, reduced &quot;real provincial&quot; worth only or for use only in Spain (with the old real worth now called &quot;real nacional&quot; and retained in Latin America). In 1686 Spain minted a coin worth provinciales (or only , known as the &quot;peso maria&quot; or &quot;peso sencillo&quot;) which was poorly received by the people.

An edict made in the same year which valued the peso duro at = 15 and 2/34 reales de vellon proved to be ineffective as the various reales in circulation contained even less silver. The situation was only resolved in 1837 with the peso duro fixed at $1 = 20 reales de vellon, with all prior non-standard reales demonetized.

The loss of Spain&#x27;s territories in the Americas and the ensuing domestic instability in the 19th century cut off the inflow of precious metals into Spain and resulted in French coinage gradually entering domestic circulation. Two subsequent decimal system reforms were attempted in 1850 (at = , each of or ) and 1864 (at = , each of ) but were not fully carried out. The peso and the real were only fully retired with the introduction in 1868 of the Spanish peseta, at par with the French franc, and at the rate of = = = of fine silver.

===1821–1897 Mexican dollar===
The successful revolt of the Spanish colonies in America had cut off the supply of silver coin by 1820. By 1825 &quot;...the Spanish dollar, the universal coin of three centuries, had lost its supremacy, and...its universal dominion was in process of disintegration into rival &#x27;currency areas&#x27;, chief among which was destined to be the area dominated by British sterling.&quot;

The Spanish dollar continued to dominate the Eastern trade, and the peso of eight reales continued to be minted in the New World. The coin was sometimes called a Republican dollar, but eventually any peso of the old Spanish eight-real standard was generally referred to as a Mexican dollar, Mexico being the most prolific producer. Mexico restored the standard of 1772, producing a coin of 27.073 g, 0.9028 fine, containing 24.441 g fine silver (the mark weight of the Mexico City mint was very slightly heavier than the standard mark of Spain).

In 1869–1870, not long after adopting the metric system, Mexican mints began producing the peso of “Un Peso” denomination, popularly known as “balanza” (scales), with the same weight and fineness, but with a uniform diameter of 37 mm (making it slightly thicker than the old peso, which was slightly irregular, with a diameter of 38–40 mm). Chinese merchants rejected the new coin, discounting it by 4%–5% in favor of the old eight-real peso. Faced with this threat to her silver exports, Mexico returned to the old eight-real peso by decree of May 29, 1873, but international trade was already shifting from silver to gold, and after 1873 there was a steady decline in the international price of silver.

Until 1873 the Mexican dollar would have been to all intents and purposes equal in value to the silver dollar coins of the United States north of the border, but at that time in history, the Mexican coin would have had a much greater international presence than the U.S. dollar. The great silver devaluation of 1873 caused the Mexican dollar to drop in value against the U.S. dollar, but until the beginning of the 20th century the Mexican dollar would still have been a more widely accepted coin in the Far East than the U.S. dollar. Between the 16th and 19th centuries Mexico produced well over three billion of these coins. Mexico minted the last eight-real peso in 1897, and at the beginning of the twentieth century these Mexican dollar coins were worth only 50 U.S. cents.

===Philippine peso===

The Philippine peso (Filipino: piso) is derived from the Spanish silver coin &quot;Real de a Ocho&quot; or &quot;Spanish dollar&quot;, in wide circulation in the entire America and Southeast Asia during the 17th and 18th centuries, through its use in the Spanish colonies and even in the United States and Canada.
Prior to 1852 the Philippines had no currency of its own (with the exception of local copper cuartos) since pesos received from Spain and Spanish Latin America were accepted in circulation. Locally issued pesos only came about with
* The issuance of Philippine peso fuerte banknotes in 1852 by the &quot;Banco Español-Filipino de Isabel II&quot; (now the Bank of the Philippine Islands)
* The founding of the Casa de Moneda de Manila mint in 1857 and the minting of gold 1, 2 and 4 peso coins starting 1861, and
* The minting of 50, 20 and 10 centimo silver coins starting 1864.

As with Mexican dollars, the Philippine unit was based on silver, unlike the United States and Canada where a gold standard operated. Thus, following the great silver devaluation of 1873, the Philippine peso devalued in parallel with the Mexican unit, and by the end of the 19th century, was worth half a United States dollar. The name of the currency remained unchanged despite the 1896 Philippine Revolution and the subsequent declaration of independence in 1898.

<text>Leverkusen () is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, on the eastern bank of the Rhine. To the south, Leverkusen borders the city of Cologne, and to the north the state capital, Düsseldorf. The city is part of the Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region, one of Europe&#x27;s largest urban areas.

With about 163,000 inhabitants, Leverkusen is one of the state&#x27;s smaller cities. The city is known for the pharmaceutical company Bayer and its sports club Bayer Leverkusen.

== History ==
The heart of what is now Leverkusen was Wiesdorf, a village on the Rhine, which dates back to the 12th century. With the surrounding villages which have now been incorporated, the area also includes the rivers Wupper and Dhünn, and has suffered a lot from flooding, notably in 1571 and 1657, the latter resulting in Wiesdorf being moved East from the river to its present location.

During the Cologne War, from 1583 to 1588 Leverkusen was ravaged by war. The entire area was rural until the late 19th century, when industry prompted the development that led to the city of Leverkusen, and to its becoming one of the most important centres of the German chemical industry.

The chemist Carl Leverkus, looking for a place to build a dye factory, chose Wiesdorf in 1860. He built a factory for the production of artificial ultramarine blue at the Kahlberg in Wiesdorf in 1861, and called the emerging settlement &quot;Leverkusen&quot; after his family home in Lennep. The factory was taken over by the Bayer company in 1891; Bayer moved its headquarters to Wiesdorf in 1912. After asset confiscation at the end of the First World War, it became IG Farben. The city of Leverkusen proper was founded in 1930 by merging Wiesdorf, Schlebusch, Steinbüchel and Rheindorf, and was posthumously named for Carl Leverkus.

During the Second World War, the IG Farben factories were bombed by the RAF on 22 August 1943, again by the RAF during bombing campaigns on 19/20 November, the USAAF Eighth Air Force on 1 December 1943, and finally once again by the RAF on 10/11 December 1943.

In 1975, Opladen (including Quettingen and Lützenkirchen since 1930), Hitdorf and Bergisch Neukirchen joined Leverkusen. The present city is made up of former villages, originally called Wiesdorf, Opladen, Schlebusch, Manfort, Bürrig, Hitdorf, Quettingen, Lützenkirchen, Steinbüchel, Rheindorf and Bergisch-Neukirchen.

On 27 July 2021, an explosion at the Chempark site in the city killed 7 people and injured 31 others.

<doc id="179599" wikidata="Q47619" url="?curid=179599" title="Nadine Gordimer">
<text>Nadine Gordimer (20 November 192313 July 2014) was a South African writer and political activist. She received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1991, recognised as a writer &quot;who through her magnificent epic writing has ... been of very great benefit to humanity&quot;.

Gordimer was one of the most honored female writers of her generation. She received the Booker Prize for &quot;The Conservationist&quot;, and the Central News Agency Literary Award for &quot;The Conservationist&quot;, &quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;July&#x27;s People&quot;.

Gordimer&#x27;s writing dealt with moral and racial issues, particularly apartheid in South Africa. Under that regime, works such as &quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; were banned. She was active in the anti-apartheid movement, joining the African National Congress during the days when the organisation was banned, and gave Nelson Mandela advice on his famous 1964 defence speech at the trial which led to his conviction for life. She was also active in HIV/AIDS causes.

==Early life==
Gordimer was born to Jewish parents near Springs, an East Rand mining town outside Johannesburg. She was the second daughter of Isidore Gordimer (1887–1962), a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant watchmaker from Žagarė in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire), and Hannah &quot;Nan&quot; ( Myers) Gordimer (1897–1973), a British Jewish immigrant from London. Her father was raised with an Orthodox Jewish education before immigrating with his family to South Africa at the age of 13. Her mother was from an established family and came to South Africa at the age of 6 with her parents. Gordimer was raised in a secular household. Her mother was not religiously observant, and mostly assimilated, whereas her father maintained a membership of the local Orthodox synagogue and attended once a year for the Yom Kippur services.

===Family background===
Gordimer&#x27;s early interest in racial and economic inequality in South Africa was shaped in part by her parents. Her father&#x27;s experience as a refugee from Tsarist Russia helped form Gordimer&#x27;s political identity, but he was neither an activist nor particularly sympathetic toward the experiences of black people under apartheid. Conversely, Gordimer saw activism by her mother, whose concern about the poverty and discrimination faced by black people in South Africa led her to found a crèche for black children. Gordimer also witnessed government repression first-hand as a teenager; the police raided her family home, confiscating letters and diaries from a servant&#x27;s room.

Gordimer was educated at a Catholic convent school, but was largely home-bound as a child because her mother, for &quot;strange reasons of her own&quot;, did not put her into school (apparently, she feared that Gordimer had a weak heart). Home-bound and often isolated, she began writing at an early age, and published her first stories in 1937 at the age of 13. Her first published work was a short story for children, &quot;The Quest for Seen Gold&quot;, which appeared in the &quot;Children&#x27;s Sunday Express&quot; in 1937; &quot;Come Again Tomorrow&quot;, another children&#x27;s story, appeared in &quot;Forum&quot; around the same time. At the age of 16, she had her first adult fiction published. 

==Career==
Gordimer studied for a year at the University of the Witwatersrand, where she mixed for the first time with fellow professionals across the colour bar. She also became involved in the Sophiatown renaissance. She did not complete her degree, but moved to Johannesburg in 1948, where she lived thereafter. While taking classes in Johannesburg, she continued to write, publishing mostly in local South African magazines. She collected many of these early stories in &quot;Face to Face&quot;, published in 1949.

In 1951, the &quot;New Yorker&quot; accepted Gordimer&#x27;s story &quot;A Watcher of the Dead&quot;, beginning a long relationship, and bringing Gordimer&#x27;s work to a much larger public. Gordimer, who said she believed the short story was the literary form for our age, continued to publish short stories in the &quot;New Yorker&quot; and other prominent literary journals. Her first publisher, Lulu Friedman, was the wife of the Parliamentarian Bernard Friedman, and it was at their house, &quot;Tall Trees&quot; in First Avenue, Lower Houghton, Johannesburg, that Gordimer met other anti-apartheid writers. Gordimer&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Lying Days&quot;, was published in 1953.

==Activism and professional life==
The arrest of her best friend, Bettie du Toit, in 1960 and the Sharpeville massacre spurred Gordimer&#x27;s entry into the anti-apartheid movement. Thereafter, she quickly became active in South African politics, and was close friends with Nelson Mandela&#x27;s defence attorneys (Bram Fischer and George Bizos) during his 1962 trial. She also helped Mandela edit his famous speech &quot;I Am Prepared to Die&quot;, given from the defendant&#x27;s dock at the trial. When Mandela was released from prison in 1990, she was one of the first people he wanted to see.

During the 1960s and 1970s, she continued to live in Johannesburg, although she occasionally left for short periods of time to teach at several universities in the United States. She had begun to achieve international literary recognition, receiving her first major literary award, the W. H. Smith Commonwealth Literary Award, in 1961. Throughout this time, Gordimer continued to demand through both her writing and her activism that South Africa re-examine and replace its long-held policy of apartheid. In 1973, she was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature by Artur Lundkvist of the Swedish Academy&#x27;s Nobel committee.

During this time, the South African government banned several of her works, two for lengthy periods of time. &quot;The Late Bourgeois World&quot; was Gordimer&#x27;s first personal experience with censorship; it was banned in 1976 for a decade by the South African government. &quot;A World of Strangers&quot; was banned for twelve years. Other works were censored for lesser amounts of time. &quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, published in June 1979, was banned one month later. The Publications Committee&#x27;s Appeal Board reversed the censorship of &quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; three months later, determining that the book was too one-sided to be subversive. Gordimer responded to this decision in &quot;Essential Gesture&quot; (1988), pointing out that the board banned two books by black authors at the same time it unbanned her own work. Gordimer&#x27;s subsequent novels escaped censorship under apartheid. In 2001, a provincial education department temporarily removed &quot;July&#x27;s People&quot; from the school reading list, along with works by other anti-apartheid writers, describing &quot;July&#x27;s People&quot; as &quot;deeply racist, superior and patronising&quot;—a characterisation that Gordimer took as a grave insult, and that many literary and political figures protested.

In South Africa, she joined the African National Congress when it was still listed as an illegal organisation by the South African government. While never blindly loyal to any organisation, Gordimer saw the ANC as the best hope for reversing South Africa&#x27;s treatment of black citizens. Rather than simply criticising the organisation for its perceived flaws, she advocated joining it to address them. She hid ANC leaders in her own home to aid their escape from arrest by the government, and she said that the proudest day of her life was when she testified at the 1986 Delmas Treason Trial on behalf of 22 South African anti-apartheid activists. (See Simon Nkoli, Mosiuoa Lekota, etc.) Throughout these years she also regularly took part in anti-apartheid demonstrations in South Africa, and traveled internationally speaking out against South African apartheid and discrimination and political repression.

Her works began achieving literary recognition early in her career, with her first international recognition in 1961, followed by numerous literary awards throughout the ensuing decades. Literary recognition for her accomplishments culminated with the Nobel Prize for Literature on 3 October 1991, which noted that Gordimer &quot;through her magnificent epic writing has—in the words of Alfred Nobel—been of very great benefit to humanity&quot;.

Gordimer&#x27;s activism was not limited to the struggle against apartheid. She resisted censorship and state control of information, and fostered the literary arts. She refused to let her work be aired by the South African Broadcasting Corporation because it was controlled by the apartheid government. Gordimer also served on the steering committee of South Africa&#x27;s Anti-Censorship Action Group. A founding member of the Congress of South African Writers, Gordimer was also active in South African letters and international literary organisations. She was Vice President of International PEN.

In the post-apartheid 1990s and 21st century, Gordimer was active in the HIV/AIDS movement, addressing a significant public health crisis in South Africa. In 2004, she organised about 20 major writers to contribute short fiction for &quot;Telling Tales&quot;, a fundraising book for South Africa&#x27;s Treatment Action Campaign, which lobbies for government funding for HIV/AIDS prevention and care. On this matter, she was critical of the South African government, noting in 2004 that she approved of everything President Thabo Mbeki had done except his stance on AIDS.

In 2005, Gordimer went on lecture tours and spoke on matters of foreign policy and discrimination beyond South Africa. For instance, in 2005, when Fidel Castro fell ill, Gordimer joined six other Nobel prize winners in a public letter to the United States warning it not to seek to destabilise Cuba&#x27;s communist government. Gordimer&#x27;s resistance to discrimination extended to her even refusing to accept &quot;shortlisting&quot; in 1998 for the Orange Prize, because the award recognizes only women writers. Gordimer also taught at the Massey College of the University of Toronto as a lecturer in 2006.

She was a vocal critic of the ANC government&#x27;s Protection of State Information Bill, publishing a lengthy condemnation in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 2012.

==Personal life==
Gordimer had a daughter, Oriane (born 1950), by her first marriage in 1949 to Gerald Gavron (Gavronsky), a local dentist, from whom she was divorced within three years. In 1954, she married Reinhold Cassirer, a highly respected art dealer from the well-known German-Jewish Cassirer family. Cassirer established the South African Sotheby&#x27;s and later ran his own gallery; their &quot;wonderful marriage&quot; lasted until his death from emphysema in 2001. Their son, Hugo, was born in 1955, and is a filmmaker in New York, with whom Gordimer collaborated on at least two documentaries. Gordimer&#x27;s daughter, Oriane Gavronsky, has two children and lives in the South of France. Gordimer also spent time with her family in France, as she and Cassirer had bought a small hilltop home near Nice.

In a 1979–80 interview Gordimer, who was Jewish, identified herself as an atheist, but added: &quot;I think I have a basically religious temperament, perhaps even a profoundly religious one.&quot; She was not involved in Jewish communal life, though both her husbands were Jewish. In a 1996 interview she said: &quot;The only time I seriously enquired into religion was in my mid-thirties, when I experienced a strange kind of loss or lack in myself and thought this may be because I had no religion.&quot; She read Teilhard de Chardin, Simone Weil and books about world religions, continuing: &quot;For the first time in my life I learned something about Judaism, the religion of my parents. But it didn&#x27;t happen. I could not take the leap of faith.&quot; She did, however, feel that her moral values emerged from the Judeo-Christian tradition.

She did not feel that being from an oppressed people was the reason that she was engaged in the anti-apartheid struggle: &quot;I get rather annoyed when people suggest that my engagement in the anti-apartheid struggle can somehow be traced back to my Jewishness... I refuse to accept that one must oneself have been exposed to prejudice and exploitation to be opposed to it. I like to think that all decent people, whatever their religious or ethnic background, have an equal responsibility to fight what is evil. To say otherwise is to concede too much.&quot;

In 2008, Gordimer defended her decision to attend a Jerusalem Writers Conference in Israel. Gordimer could be critical of Israel, but rejected comparison of its policies to apartheid in South Africa.

Until the end of her life, she lived in the same home in Parktown in Johannesburg for over five decades. In 2006, Gordimer was attacked in her home by robbers, sparking outrage in the country. Gordimer apparently refused to move into a gated complex, against the advice of some friends. Although her children and grandchildren lived overseas and friends had emigrated, she had no plans to leave South Africa permanently: &quot;It&#x27;s always been a nightmare in my mind, to be cut off.&quot;

===Unauthorised biography===
Ronald Suresh Roberts published a biography of Gordimer, &quot;No Cold Kitchen&quot;, in 2006. She had granted Roberts interviews and access to her personal papers, with an understanding that she would authorise the biography in return for a right to review the manuscript before publication. However, Gordimer and Roberts failed to reach an agreement over his account of the illness and death of Gordimer&#x27;s husband Reinhold Cassirer and an affair Gordimer had in the 1950s, as well as criticism of her views on the Israel–Palestine conflict. Gordimer disowned the book, accusing Roberts of breach of trust. Publishers Bloomsbury Publishing in London and Farrar, Straus and Giroux in New York subsequently withdrew from the project. Suresh subsequently criticised Gordimer for her decision and her stances on other issues.

==Death==
Gordimer died in her sleep at her Johannesburg home on 13 July 2014 at the age of 90.

==Works, themes, and reception==
Gordimer achieved lasting international recognition for her works, most of which deal with political issues, as well as the &quot;moral and psychological tensions of her racially divided home country.&quot; Virtually all of Gordimer&#x27;s works deal with themes of love and politics, particularly concerning race in South Africa. Always questioning power relations and truth, Gordimer tells stories of ordinary people, revealing moral ambiguities and choices. Her characterisation is nuanced, revealed more through the choices her characters make than through their claimed identities and beliefs. She also weaves in subtle details within the characters&#x27; names.

===Overview of critical works===
Her first published novel, &quot;The Lying Days&quot; (1953), takes place in Gordimer&#x27;s home town of Springs, Transvaal, an East Rand mining town near Johannesburg. Arguably a semi-autobiographical work, &quot;The Lying Days&quot; is a Bildungsroman, charting the growing political awareness of a young white woman, Helen, toward small-town life and South African racial division.

In her 1963 work, &quot;Occasion for Loving&quot;, Gordimer puts apartheid and love squarely together. Her protagonist, Ann Davis, is married to Boaz Davis, an ethnomusicologist, but in love with Gideon Shibalo, an artist with several failed relationships. Davis is white, however, and Shibalo is black, and South Africa&#x27;s government criminalised such relationships.

Gordimer collected the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for &quot;A Guest of Honour&quot; in 1971 and, in common with a number of winners of this award, she was to go on to win the Booker Prize. The Booker was awarded to Gordimer for her 1974 novel, &quot;The Conservationist&quot;, and was a co-winner with Stanley Middleton&#x27;s novel &quot;Holiday&quot;. &quot;The Conservationist&quot; explores Zulu culture and the world of a wealthy white industrialist through the eyes of Mehring, the antihero. Per Wästberg described &quot;The Conservationist&quot; as Gordimer&#x27;s &quot;densest and most poetical novel&quot;. Thematically covering the same ground as Olive Schreiner&#x27;s &quot;The Story of an African Farm&quot; (1883) and J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s &quot;In the Heart of the Country&quot; (1977), the &quot;conservationist&quot; seeks to conserve nature to preserve the apartheid system, keeping change at bay. When an unidentified corpse is found on his farm, Mehring does the &quot;right thing&quot; by providing it a proper burial; but the dead person haunts the work, a reminder of the bodies on which Mehring&#x27;s vision would be built.

Gordimer&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;Burger&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is the story of a woman analysing her relationship with her father, a martyr to the anti-apartheid movement. The child of two Communist and anti-apartheid revolutionaries, Rosa Burger finds herself drawn into political activism as well. Written in the aftermath of the 1976 Soweto uprising, the novel was shortly thereafter banned by the South African government. Gordimer described the novel as a &quot;coded homage&quot; to Bram Fischer, the lawyer who defended Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid activists.

In &quot;July&#x27;s People&quot; (1981), she imagines a bloody South African revolution, in which white people are hunted and murdered after blacks revolt against the apartheid government. The work follows Maureen and Bamford Smales, an educated white couple, hiding for their lives with July, their long-time former servant. The novel plays off the various groups of &quot;July&#x27;s people&quot;: his family and his village, as well as the Smales. The story examines how people cope with the terrible choices forced on them by violence, race hatred, and the state.

&quot;The House Gun&quot; (1998) was Gordimer&#x27;s second post-apartheid novel. It follows the story of a couple, Claudia and Harald Lingard, dealing with their son Duncan&#x27;s murder of one of his housemates. The novel treats the rising crime rate in South Africa and the guns that virtually all households have, as well as the legacy of South African apartheid and the couple&#x27;s concerns about their son&#x27;s lawyer, who is black. The novel was optioned for film rights to Granada Productions.

Gordimer&#x27;s award-winning 2002 novel, &quot;The Pickup&quot;, considers the issues of displacement, alienation, and immigration; class and economic power; religious faith; and the ability for people to see, and love, across these divides. It tells the story of a couple: Julie Summers, a white woman from a financially secure family, and Abdu, an illegal Arab immigrant in South Africa. After Abdu&#x27;s visa is refused, the couple returns to his homeland, where she is the alien. Her experiences and growth as an alien in another culture form the heart of the work.

&quot;Get a Life&quot;, written in 2005 after the death of her long-time spouse, Reinhold Cassirer, is the story of a man undergoing treatment for a life-threatening disease. While clearly drawn from personal life experiences, the novel also continues Gordimer&#x27;s exploration of political themes. The protagonist is an ecologist, battling installation of a planned nuclear plant. But he is at the same time undergoing radiation therapy for his cancer, causing him personal grief and, ironically, rendering him a nuclear health hazard in his own home. Here, Gordimer again pursues the questions of how to integrate everyday life and political activism. &quot;New York Times&quot; critic J. R. Ramakrishnan, who noted a similarity with author Mia Alvar, wrote that Gordimer wrote about &quot;long-suffering spouses and (the) familial enablers of political men&quot; in her fiction.

===Jewish themes and characters===
Gordimer has occasionally given voice to Jewish characters, rituals and themes in her short stories and novels.

Kenneth Bonert, writing in &quot;The Forward&quot;, expressed the view that Jewish identity was rarely explored in her work: &quot;For all of her Jewish heritage and personal connections (not only were her parents and family Jews, so were both of her husbands), overt signs of Jewishness are largely absent from her body of work. It&#x27;s impossible to guess from the books alone that Gordimer was Jewish; and it would be easy to assume the contrary, since whenever Jews do appear in her fiction, they tend to be seen through the eyes of a non-Jew, looking in with almost anthropological fascination onto an alien culture.&quot;

In &quot;The Later Fiction by Nadine Gordimer&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 1993), edited by Bryce King, Michael Wade fostered a discussion on Jewish identity as a repressed theme in Gordimer&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Sport of Nature&quot; (1987): &quot;Any exploration of the Jewish theme in Nadine Gordimer&#x27;s writing, especially her novels, in an exploration of the absent, the unwritten, the repressed.&quot; Wade noted parallels between Gordimer&#x27;s white, Jewish social milieu with those of Jewish writers living in urban areas on America&#x27;s east coast: &quot;Jewishness functioning as a mysterious but ineluctable cultural component of individual identity and expressed as an aspect of the nominally Jewish writer&#x27;s particular, unique quest for identity in a heterogeneous society&quot;.

Benjamin Ivry, writing in &quot;The Forward&quot;, highlighted several examples where Gordimer employed Jewish characters and themes: &quot;Gordimer proved that indeed anything was possible when examining the personal significance of Yiddishkeit.&quot;

In 1951, she wrote &quot;A Watcher of the Dead&quot; for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. It centres on the death of a Jewish grandmother and her family observing the ritual of &quot;Shemira&quot;, as they arrange for a &quot;shomer&quot; to watch over the body from the time of death until burial. The story later appeared in &quot;The Soft Voice of the Serpent&quot; the following year. 

In the same collection, Gordimer&#x27;s story, &quot;The Defeated&quot; appeared. It follows the narrator&#x27;s friendship with a young Jewish immigrant, Miriam Saiyetowitz. Miriam&#x27;s parents operate a Concession store among the mine compound stores. They later study together at university to become teachers, and Miriam marries a doctor. The narrator visits Miriam&#x27;s parents on an impulse at their store, they feel abandoned by Miriam, who rarely visits from Johannesburg with their grandson. The narrator explained &quot;I stood there in Miriam&#x27;s guilt before the Saiyetovitzes, and they were silent, in the accusation of the humble.&quot; For Wade: &quot;Miriam&#x27;s punishment of her parents for their otherness is severe and complete, and conceals Gordimer&#x27;s own desire to avenge her sense of displacement on her parents for their otherness.&quot;

In her debut novel &quot;The Lying Days&quot; (1953), a major character, Joel Aaron, son of a working class Jewish shopkeeper, acts as a voice of conscience. He has progressive, enlightened views about apartheid. His ethical stances and sense of Jewish identity and ancestry impresses his non-Jewish white middle-class friend, Helen: &quot;His nature had for mine the peculiar charm of the courage to be itself without defiance.&quot; Joel is known for his intelligence and integrity. In contrast to Miriam in &quot;The Defeated&quot;, Aaron effortlessly accepts his parents and their background. He is a Zionist and makes aliyah to Israel.

In &quot;A World of Strangers&quot; (1958), there is less Jewish character development, with only a reference to an older man at a party with a thick Eastern European accent with an attractive blonde spouse. In &quot;Occasion for Loving&quot; (1963), a Jewish character, Boaz Davis appears, but for Wade: &quot;the only Jewish thing is his name&quot;.

For Wade, Gordimer saw her father as the most emblematic symbol of Jewishness in her household: &quot;she was compelled to make him both the sign of Jewishness and the object of her rejection.&quot; The Jewish otherness is also attributed to the patriarch in &quot;Harry&#x27;s Presence&quot;, a 1960 short story by Gordimer. It is notable as Gordimer&#x27;s only treatment of the Jewish immigrant experience that does not include or mention black characters. 

In 1966, Gordimer wrote an original story for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;. &quot;The Visit&quot; includes an extract from the Talmud and follows David Levy returning home from a Friday night Shabbat service. In the same year she published &quot;A Third Presence&quot; for &quot;The London Magazine&quot;. The story follows two Jewish sisters, Rose and Naomi Rasovsky. According to Wade: &quot;The story&#x27;s ending indicates that Gordimer has not yet broken through the wool-and-iron barriers of confusion and conflict aroused by the question of her Jewish identity.&quot;

In 1983, she published &quot;Letter from His Father&quot; in &quot;The London Review of Books&quot;, a response to Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;Letter to His Father&quot;. In the letter, Gordimer makes references to Yiddish, Yom Kippur, Aliyah, Kibbutzim and Yiddish theatre.

Hillela, a Jewish South African woman, figures as the protagonist of &quot;A Sport of Nature&quot;, (1987). Wade concluded: &quot;By writing &quot;A Sport of Nature&quot; in the transcendent style she chose, she tried again to give meaning to her personal muddle over Jewish identity and experience, this time by creating Hillela, whose name represents the deepest moral and prophetic tradition in Jewish history, and who, united with Reuel (=Jethro), the great (not-Jewish) guide and adviser of the beginnings of that history, is able to resolve the inherent contradictions of (the writer&#x27;s?) white-South-African-radical-Jewish identity. But Hillela is perhaps the most striking example in all Gordimer&#x27;s writing of &#x27;the Jew that went away&#x27;, and it is not clear that she succeeds in creating the new sign she seems to have sought.&quot;

In the short story &quot;My Father Leaves Home&quot;, that appears in &quot;Jump: And Other Stories&quot; (1991), Gordimer describes an Eastern European &quot;shtetl&quot;, presumably the hometown of the title character. The anti-semitism the character faced in Europe makes him more sensitive to racism against black people in South Africa.

In Gordimer&#x27;s final novel &quot;No Time Like the Present&quot; (2012), one of the central characters, Stephen, is half-Jewish and married to a Zulu woman. His nephew&#x27;s Bar Mitzvah prompts a meditation on his own Jewish background and he fails to grasp his brother&#x27;s embrace of Judaism.

<doc id="179601" wikidata="Q200859" url="?curid=179601" title="Tullus Hostilius">
<text>Tullus Hostilius (; r. 672–640 BC) was the legendary third king of Rome. He succeeded Numa Pompilius and was succeeded by Ancus Marcius. Unlike his predecessor, Tullus was known as a warlike king who, according to the Roman historian Livy, believed the more peaceful nature of his predecessor had weakened Rome. It has been attested that he sought out war and was even more warlike than the first king of Rome, Romulus. Accounts of the death of Tullus Hostilius vary. In the mythological version of events Livy describes, he had angered Jupiter who then killed him with a bolt of lightning. Non-mythological sources on the other hand describe that he died of plague after a rule of 32 years.

Tullus Hostilius was the grandson of Hostus Hostilius, who had fought with Romulus and died during the Sabine invasion of Rome. According to Plutarch, when Numa Pompilius died after a reign of forty-three years, his Pontifex Maximus Numa Marcius contended with Tullus Hostilius for the throne, but being defeated, he starved himself to death. Marcius&#x27;s son, also named Numa Marcius, would serve as under Tullus, and would be the father of Ancus Marcius, Tullus&#x27;s successor.

The principal feature of Tullus&#x27; reign was the defeat of Alba Longa. After Alba Longa was beaten (by the victory of three Roman champions over three Albans), Alba Longa became Rome&#x27;s vassal state.

During his reign, Hostilius created the college of the Fetiales that concluded all treaties in the name of Rome.

==Historical events==
Two distinctive events are traditionally ascribed to Tullus&#x27;s reign. Historians regard the events as having taken place during the early regal period, but the question of whether the events should be directly associated with Tullus is debatable.

The first event is the destruction of Alba Longa. The historical record shows that the Alban Hills were the site of a large settlement and that this settlement fell under Roman power during the regal period. Details are uncertain about when and by whom Alba Longa was destroyed. It was almost certainly subjugated at a later date than that given by Livy and it may have been destroyed by the Latins and not by the Romans (who might have regarded the destruction of their own traditional mother-country as impious).

===Wars with Alba Longa===
The battle of Alba Longa was settled by having two sets of triplets, one born in Alba Longa and one in Rome, fight for their city. The last person standing alive would be the winner, and his city would win the war without having their armies engage in battle. The story states that these triplets were singled out as champions of both cities. According to Livy, the triplets were named Horatii and Curiatii, and the majority believed that the Horatii belonged to Rome and the Curiatii to Alba Longa, though this is not certain. After battling for a long time, one of the Roman brothers was victorious, thus Rome and Tullus Hostilius won the battle.

The Alban dictator Mettius Fufetius betrayed Rome during the war with the Etruscans, where Rome requested Alban military assistance, which Mettius agreed to, but also had a secret agreement with the Etruscans to desert Rome in the heat of battle, leaving Tullus alone to fight the battle. Mettius also betrayed the Etruscans by not joining in the battle at all. Tullus won the battle despite the betrayal. Mettius was taken prisoner by Tullus.

Tullus ordered Alba Longa to be destroyed and forced the migration of the Alban citizenry to Rome, where they were integrated and became Roman citizens. For the betrayal of Rome, Tullus had Mettius Fufetius tied between two chariots; the horses then ripped Mettius into two pieces. According to Livy, this was the first and last time the Romans used this method of execution.

===Construction of the Curia Hostilia===
Tullus&#x27;s second alleged historical accomplishment was the construction of the original Roman Senate house, the Curia Hostilia. After the incorporation of leaders from Alba Longa into the senate, it became necessary to erect a new building to accommodate the now much bigger Roman Senate. Thus the Curia Hostilla was built. It was universally held by tradition to have been built by—and named in honor of—Tullus, and its remains on the northwestern edge of the Forum have been dated to around 600 BC. Although that date falls well outside the traditionally-ascribed period of Tullus Hostilius&#x27; reign, scholars are dubious regarding the tales of the overly-long reigns of the Roman kings—with an average reign of 34 years per king, the traditional chronology would be without historical parallel (the royal rulers of the remarkably stable and healthy English monarchy have an average reign of 21 years each). Recent archaeological research supports historian Tim Cornell&#x27;s proposal of a more plausible chronology which contracts the regal period from 240 years to around 120 years. This places the historical accomplishments of the kings between 625 BC—the date that the archaeological record shows the first signs of Rome&#x27;s urbanisation and unification—and 500 BC. Using this timeframe, the construction of the Curia Hostilia is possible during the reign of Tullus Hostilius. It would also explain things which are otherwise puzzling: Tullus&#x27;s name being attached to the building, and how, as Roman traditions attest, Tullus could have led Rome&#x27;s successful wars against the Fidenae and Veii and the Sabines.

==Myth==
As with those of all the early kings of Rome, the events ascribed to the reign of Tullus Hostilius are treated with scepticism by modern historians. Part of this is due to obvious flaws in the literary tradition describing the kings: much like the confusion the Ancients exhibited in attributing identical accomplishments to both Tarquinius Priscus and Tarquinius Superbus, the accomplishments of Tullus Hostilius are thought by many scholars to be rhetorical doublet of those of Romulus. Both are brought up among shepherds, carry on war against Fidenae and Veii, double the number of citizens, and organize the army. Additionally, Tullus Hostilius&#x27; warlike and ferocious character seems to be little more than a contrasting stereotype to that of the peaceable, devout Numa Pompilius; the first Roman annalists may merely have imputed aggressive qualities to Hostilius by naively parsing his gentile name (&quot;Hostilius&quot; meaning &quot;hostile&quot; in Latin).

Hostilius was probably a historical figure, however, in the strict sense that a man bearing the name Tullus Hostilius likely reigned as king in Rome. The most compelling evidence is his name: &quot;Tullus&quot; is an unusual praenomen in Roman culture, and his gentile name is obscure and linguistically archaic enough to rule out the possibility that he was a crude later invention.

Dominique Briquel proposes that Livy was historicizing an ancient pattern of Indo-European legend, in which a single violent figure is followed by a single peacemaker, in this case Ancus Marcius. More mythological examples of this legend involve Jupiter and Mars, Odin and Týr, and Indra and Mitra.

==Death==
According to Livy, Tullus paid little heed to religious observances during his reign, thinking them unworthy of a king&#x27;s attention. However, at the close of his reign, Rome was affected by a series of prophecies including a shower of stones on the Alban Mount (in response to which a public religious festival of nine days was held – a &quot;novendialis&quot;), a loud voice was heard on the summit of the mount complaining that the Albans had failed to show devotion to their former gods, and a pestilence struck in Rome. King Tullus became ill and was filled with superstition. He reviewed the commentaries of Numa Pompilius and attempted to carry out sacrifices recommended by him. However, Tullus did not undertake the ceremony to Jupiter Elicius correctly, and both he and his house were struck by lightning and reduced to ashes as a result of the anger of Jupiter.

There are two stories concerning the death of Tullus Hostilius and his family. The first is that his house was hit by lightning and burned to the ground with no survivors. The second is that Ancus Marcius and some of his followers went to Tullus Hostilius&#x27;s home with swords hidden under their robes. Once inside the home, the party killed Tullus, his family, and their servants and razed the property to ensure there would be no heir to the throne. 

== In fiction ==
Incidents from legends surrounding Tullus Hostilius were used as the basis of opera librettos during the baroque period in music, beginning with a &quot;Tullo Ostilio&quot; opera performed in Rome in 1694 with music of Giovanni Bononcini. Operatic pastiches with the title &quot;Tullo Ostilio&quot; performed in Prague in 1727 and Brno in 1735 included music of Antonio Vivaldi. Consistent with contemporary conventions, the stories concentrate on concocted love stories involving members of the principal character&#x27;s family.

Tullus Hostilius was played by Robert Keith in the 1961 film &quot;Duel of Champions&quot;, which centered around the Horatii.

Tullus is briefly mentioned in the &quot;Aeneid&quot; in the description of Aeneas&#x27; shield. He is described as hauling away the remains of the liar Mettius through the brush.

He is a character in Philip José Farmer&#x27;s novel &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot;, the first of the &quot;Riverworld&quot; series. After the Resurrection, he has teamed up with Hermann Göring to run a slave state.

<doc id="179605" wikidata="Q7393374" url="?curid=179605" title="SS City of Flint (1919)">
<text>The SS &quot;City of Flint&quot; was a cargo ship of a type known colloquially as a Hog Islander, due to it being built at the Hog Island Shipyard, Philadelphia by American International Shipbuilding for the United States Shipping Board (USSB), Emergency Fleet Corporation. &quot;City of Flint&quot; was named to honor the citizens of Flint, Michigan for their effort in Liberty Loan drives during World War I.

The ship was sold to the Southgate Nelson Co., American Hampton Roads Line in 1930, but reverted to the USSB by 1935. By 1940 the USSB had been replaced by the United States Maritime Commission as owner and the ship was being operated as a Maritime Commission cargo vessel. During World War II &quot;City of Flint&quot; was being operated by United States Lines allocated to Army cargo requirements.

&quot;City of Flint&quot; was the first American ship captured by Nazi Germany during World War II.

==The &quot;Athenia&quot;==
The &quot;City of Flint&quot;, under the command of Captain Joseph A. Gainard, first became involved in the war when she rescued 200 survivors of the torpedoed British passenger liner on 3 September 1939. &quot;Athenia&quot; had been torpedoed that afternoon by the commanded by Kapitanleutnant Fritz-Julius Lemp south of Rockall Bank (in the Atlantic Ocean west of Scotland and south of Iceland) and sent out a distress signal. &quot;City of Flint&quot;, the Norwegian freighter &quot;Knute Nelson&quot;, the Swedish yacht &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and the destroyers and responded to rescue survivors.

The Captain of HMS &quot;Electra&quot;, Lt Cdr Sammy A. Buss, took charge as senior officer present. He sent the destroyer on an anti-submarine sweep of the area, while &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Escort&quot;, &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, &quot;Knute Nelson&quot; and the &quot;City of Flint&quot; rescued the survivors. Between the ships, about 981 passengers and crew were rescued. &quot;City of Flint&quot; rescued more than 200 and the provisions for American passengers leaving Europe who had embarked at Glasgow contributed to the welfare of the survivors. One hundred and twelve people were killed, and &quot;Athenia&quot; sank the next morning.

==Seizure==
In October 1939, &quot;City of Flint&quot; was carrying a cargo of tractors, grain and fruit to Britain. On 9 October, the seized the &quot;City of Flint&quot; , declaring her cargo to be contraband and the ship a prize of war. A German prize crew was put on board the ship to sail her back to Germany.

To avoid ships of the Royal Navy and obtain water, the ship headed for Tromsø on the north coast of Norway, arriving on 20 October 1939. Norway, neutral at the time and disturbed by the sinking of the merchant ship , refused entry to the Germans, giving them 24 hours to leave. The Norwegian destroyer escorted the &quot;City of Flint&quot; out of Norwegian territorial waters at 1620hrs the next day.

The prize crew then sailed for Murmansk in the Soviet Union, arriving on 23 October. Claiming &quot;havarie&quot; (the privilege of sanctuary for damage caused at sea), the ship lay in Murmansk harbor under the control of the German prize crew for several days and was eventually forced to leave by the Soviet Union, stating that if the Germans claimed &quot;havarie&quot;, the American crew could not be prisoners of war. The Soviets interned the German prize crew on 24 October but restored them to control on 27 October under the principle requiring a ship to leave in the same condition as on entry. On 28 October the ship sailed for Norway under German control without Captain Gainard, who was an inactive United States Naval Reserve officer, having been allowed to communicate with United States Embassy officials.

In the several weeks that elapsed, the United States ordered many US merchant ships to register with other countries, so as to continue supporting the Allies without violating the US&#x27;s nominal neutrality. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy began closing on the captured ship.

The prize crew then tried Norway again, proceeding to the port of Haugesund. The Norwegian government again refused entry, describing the German crew as kidnappers. The approaching Royal Navy left the prize crew no choice, though; on 3 November the &quot;City of Flint&quot; entered the harbor.

The ship anchored in Norway, and no one could claim the crew was making her right for passage. In consequence the Norwegian Admiralty dispatched the minelayer and boarded the &quot;City of Flint&quot; with its second in command, captain Bernt T. Dingsør and thirty armed sailors, who on 6 November returned &quot;City of Flint&quot; to Captain Gainard&#x27;s command. He unloaded his cargo in Bergen and set sail in ballast for the US. The German prize crew was interned at Kongsvinger Fortress.

&quot;City of Flint&quot; continued in service in the Atlantic until she was sunk on 23 January 1943 by the .

<text>A cooking show, cookery show, or cooking program (also spelled cooking programme in British English) is a television genre that presents food preparation, often in a restaurant kitchen or on a studio set, or at the host&#x27;s personal home. Typically the show&#x27;s host, often a celebrity chef, prepares one or more dishes over the course of an episode, taking the viewing audience through the food&#x27;s inspiration, preparation, and stages of cooking.

Cooking shows have been a popular staple of daytime TV programming since the earliest days of television. They are generally very inexpensive to produce, making them an economically easy way for a TV station to fill a half-hour (or sometimes 60-minute) time slot. A number of cooking shows have run for many seasons, especially when they are sponsored by local TV stations or by public broadcasting. Many of the more popular cooking shows have had flamboyant hosts whose unique personalities have made them into celebrities.

==Production==

Due to time and production constraints, most, if not all, cooking shows employ filming shortcuts such as video editing, food modeling and photography, and prepared ingredients to speed up the cooking process and ensure a smooth and seamless production.

==Genres==

Some cooking shows, such as &quot;Emeril Live&quot;, are oriented towards instructional material, and others, such as &quot;Trisha&#x27;s Southern Kitchen&quot;, additionally focus on showcasing the personal lives of the hosts. Some, such as the &quot;Rachael Ray Show&quot;, blend the genre with a talk show format. There are also reality competitions within the genre such as &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, &quot;MasterChef&quot; and &quot;Top Chef&quot;, where contestants are given specific requirements and a time limit to prepare meals, which are then evaluated by a panel of judges, which can include celebrity chefs and other notable personalities. Travel cooking shows such as &quot;Gordon Ramsay: Uncharted&quot; and &quot;Salt Fat Acid Heat&quot; explore the culinary experiences of host chefs in various destinations. &quot;Chopped&quot; and &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives&quot; are examples of reality cooking shows, and &quot;Chefs A&#x27; Field&quot; and &quot;Chef&#x27;s Table&quot; represent some of the documentary cooking shows.

==History==

Until the 1940s, most cooking shows were performed on the radio. The first radio cooking show in the United States, &quot;The Betty Crocker Cooking School of the Air&quot;, debuted in 1924 and featured the fictional character Betty Crocker, voiced by Agnes White Tizard.

<doc id="179616" wikidata="Q1146222" url="?curid=179616" title="Scafell Pike">
<text>Scafell Pike () is a mountain in the Lake District region of Cumbria, England. It has an elevation of above sea level, making it the highest and the most prominent mountain in England. The mountain is part of the Scafell massif, an extinct volcano, and is one of the Southern Fells.

== Etymology and name history==
The name &quot;Scafell&quot; is believed by some to derive from the Old Norse &quot;skalli fjall&quot;, meaning either the fell with the shieling or the fell with the bald summit, and is first recorded in 1578 in the corrupted form &quot;Skallfield&quot;.

Alternatively, &quot;Scafell&quot; means &quot;the mountain of the &quot;scaw&quot; (or promontory)&quot;. This usage can be compared etymologically with, for example, Skaw, Unst.

The name originally referred to Scafell, which neighbours Scafell Pike. What are now known as Scafell Pike, Ill Crag, and Broad Crag were collectively called either &quot;the Pikes&quot; (peaks) or &quot;the Pikes of Scawfell&quot; (see below regarding spelling); from many angles, Scafell seems to be the highest peak, and the others were thus considered subsidiary to it. The name &quot;Scawfell Pikes&quot; was adopted &quot;by common consent&quot; according to Jonathan Otley, shortly before the publication of the 4th edition of his guidebook in 1830. Up to this point, England&#x27;s highest mountain (its status as such was not known until the early 1800s) did not have a name of its own; it was labelled &quot;Sca-Fell Higher Top&quot; by the Ordnance Survey in their initial work in Cumbria in the first decade of the 19th century. The newly developed name reported by Otley first appeared on a published Ordnance Survey map in 1865.

Formerly the name was spelled &quot;Scawfell&quot;, which better reflects local pronunciation. This spelling has declined due to the Ordnance Survey&#x27;s use of &quot;Scafell&quot; on their 1865 map and thereafter.

==Topography==
Scafell Pike is one of a horseshoe of high fells, open to the south, surrounding the head of Eskdale, Cumbria. It stands on the western side of the cirque, with Scafell to the south and Great End to the north. This ridge forms the watershed between Eskdale and Wasdale, which lies to the west.

The narrowest definition of Scafell Pike begins at the col of Mickledore in the south, takes in the wide, stony summit area and ends at the next depression, Broad Crag Col, c. . A more inclusive view takes in two further tops: Broad Crag, and Ill Crag, , the two being separated by Ill Crag Col, . This is the position taken by most guidebooks. North of Ill Crag is the more definite depression of Calf Cove at , before the ridge climbs again to Great End, .

Scafell Pike also has outliers on either side of the ridge. Lingmell , to the north west, is invariably regarded as a separate fell, while Pen, , a shapely summit above the Esk, is normally taken as a satellite of the Pike. Middleboot Knotts is a further top lying on the Wasdale slopes of Broad Crag, which is listed as a Nuttall.

The rough summit plateau is fringed by crags on all sides with Pikes Crag and Dropping Crag above Wasdale and Rough Crag to the east. Below Rough Crag and Pen is a further tier, named Dow Crag and Central Pillar on Ordnance Survey maps, although known as Esk Buttress among climbers.

Broad Crag Col is the source of Little Narrowcove Beck in the east and of Piers Gill in the west. The latter works its way around Lingmell to Wast Water through a spectacular ravine, one of the most impressive in the Lake District. It is dangerous in rain and treacherous in winter, as when it freezes over it creates an icy patch, with lethal exposure should you slip. Several accidents and some deaths have occurred in Piers Gill.

Broad Crag is a small top with its principal face on the west and the smaller Green Crag looking down on Little Narrowcove. From Broad Crag, the ridge turns briefly east across Ill Crag Col and onto the shapely pyramidal summit of Ill Crag. Ill Crag and its associated crags overlook Eskdale.

Scafell Pike has a claim to the highest standing water body in England in Broad Crag Tarn, which (confusingly) is on Scafell Pike proper, rather than on Broad Crag. It lies at about , a quarter of a mile (400 m) south of the summit. Foxes Tarn on Scafell is of comparable height.

===Mountain classification===
Scafell Pike is a Marilyn summit which automatically makes it a HuMP and a TuMP. Scafell Pike is topologically unusual because the Marilyn qualification contour (&quot;Maquaco&quot;) line, 150 metres below the summit, passes around Scafell, which is itself a HuMP. This contour also encloses three other TuMP summits: Broad Crag, Ill Crag and Great End.

==Summit==

The summit was donated to the National Trust in 1919 by Lord Leconfield &quot;in perpetual memory of the men of the Lake District who fell for God and King, for freedom peace and right in the Great War 1914–1918 ...&quot;. There is a better-known war memorial on Great Gable, commemorating the members of the Fell &amp; Rock Climbing Club.

The actual height of Scafell Pike is a matter of definition or guesswork. The highest point is buried beneath a massive summit cairn over 3 metres high and it is not known how high the fabric of the mountain rises under the cairn. Traditionally the height was given as a very memorable . The rounded metric height of 978 metres converts to 3209 feet ±.

Scafell Pike is one of three British peaks climbed as part of the National Three Peaks Challenge, and is the highest ground for over .


== Geology ==
=== Ordovician and volcanic activity ===
Scafell Pike consists of igneous rock, including breccia, andesite and rhyolite, as well as geothermal tufa, dating from the Ordovician; it is geologically part of the Borrowdale Volcanics and along with the other peaks of the Scafells, forms part of an extinct volcano which was active around 400-450 million years ago.

=== Pleistocene glacial activity ===
The rugged summit of Scafell Pike was shaped by glacial erosion of the Last Glacial Maximum (~20,000 YA), during which the Lake District was overlain by ice sheets with thicknesses of several kilometers.

=== Contemporary weathering ===
The summit plateau of Scafell Pike, and that of other neighbouring peaks, is covered with shattered rock debris which provides the highest-altitude example of a summit boulder field in England. The boulder field is thought to have been caused in part by weathering, such as frost action. Additional factors are also considered to be important; however, opinion varies as to what these may be. James Clifton Ward suggested that weathering with earthquakes as a secondary agent could be responsible, while John Edward Marr and Reginald Aldworth Daly believed that earthquakes were unnecessary and suggested that frost action with other unspecified agents was more likely. To the north of the summit are a number of high altitude gills which flow into Lingmell Beck. These are good examples in Cumbria for this type of gill and are also biologically important due to their species richness.

== Tourism ==

Scafell Pike is a popular destination for walkers. There is open access to Scafell and the surrounding fells, with many walking and rock climbing routes. Paths connect the summit with Lingmell Col to the northwest, Mickledore to the southwest, and Esk Hause to the northeast, and these in turn connect with numerous other paths, giving access to walkers from many directions including Wasdale Head to the west, Seathwaite to the north, Langdale to the east, and Eskdale to the southwest. The shortest route is from Wasdale Head, about 80 metres above sea level, where there is a climbers&#x27; hotel, the Wasdale Head Inn, made popular in the Victorian period by Owen Glynne Jones and others. According to the National Trust, as of 2014 there were over 100,000 people per year climbing Scafell Pike from Wasdale Head, many as part of the National Three Peaks Challenge.

==Survey point==
Scafell Pike was used in 1826 as a station in the Principal Triangulation of Britain by the Ordnance Survey when they fixed the relative positions of Britain and Ireland. Angles between Slieve Donard in Northern Ireland and Scafell Pike were taken from Snowdon in Wales as were angles between Snowdon and Scafell Pike from Slieve Donard. Given the need for clear weather to achieve these very long-range observations ( to Slieve Donard), the Ordnance surveyors spent much of the summer camped on the respective mountain tops. Scafell Pike was not used as a station in the earlier part of the Principal Triangulation of Britain, even though &quot;Sca-Fell&quot; formed one corner of a Principal Triangle. The Ordnance Survey&#x27;s high precision theodolite was not taken to the summit until 1841.

<text>Mark Anthony Peter Phillips (born 22 September 1948) is an English Olympic gold medal-winning horseman for Great Britain and the first husband of Anne, Princess Royal, with whom he has two children. He remains a leading figure in British equestrian circles, a noted eventing course designer, and a columnist for &quot;Horse &amp; Hound&quot; magazine.

==Family background and early life==
Mark Anthony Peter Phillips was born on 22 September 1948. He is the son of Major Peter William Garside Phillips, MC (1920–1998) and Anne Patricia Phillips (&quot;née&quot; Tiarks; 1925–1988); they married in 1946. Anne was educated at Downe House and served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service during the Second World War. She was the only daughter of John Gerhard Edward Tiarks (1896–1962), who served in the First and Second World Wars, attained the rank of Brigadier, and Evelyn Florence Cripps (1899-1994). John Tiarks also served as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to King George VI from 1947 to 1950. Mark had a younger sister, Sarah Anne Staples (&quot;née&quot; Phillips; 1951–2014).

Phillips was educated at Stouts Hill Preparatory School near Uley, Gloucestershire, then at Marlborough College, then the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==Military career==
Upon passing out from Sandhurst, Phillips was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant into the 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards in July 1969, he was promoted to Lieutenant in January 1971. By the time of his wedding to Princess Anne in November 1973, Phillips was an acting Captain. In January 1974, he was appointed a Personal aide-de-camp to Queen Elizabeth II. Phillips was substantively promoted to captain in July 1975, and retired from the Army on 30 March 1978.

Phillips continued to style himself &quot;Captain&quot; Mark Phillips, as it is usual for retired cavalry captains to keep using their former rank if their civilian job involves working with horses, in particular in racing or equestrian sports.

==Equestrian career==

Phillips was a reserve member of the British equestrian team for the 1968 Olympics. He was part of the British three-day event teams that won a world title in 1970, a European title in 1971, and Olympic gold medals in 1972; individually, he finished in 35th place in 1972. At the 1988 Olympics, his horse sustained a pulled muscle and could not complete the individual three-day event, but Phillips won a silver medal with the British team. Phillips was a four-time champion at the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1971 and 1972 on &quot;Great Ovation&quot;, in 1974 on &quot;Colombus&quot;, and in 1981 on &quot;Lincoln&quot;. It was through his equestrian activities that he met Princess Anne, the only daughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whom he married. Their own daughter Zara Phillips later won a silver medal in the three-day event with the British team at the 2012 Olympics in London.

In 1998 Phillips designed the cross-country venue for the Red Hills Horse Trials, a qualifying event for the Olympics located in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. He is now a regular columnist for &quot;Horse &amp; Hound&quot; magazine. He also remains a leading figure in British equestrian circles and serves as &quot;Chef d&#x27;Equipe&quot; of the United States Eventing Team.

==Personal life==

Phillips first met his future wife Princess Anne at a party for horse lovers in 1968. They married on 14 November 1973, at Westminster Abbey. They have two children: Peter (born 1977) and Zara (born 1981). The Queen bought Gatcombe Park, near Minchinhampton, for the couple as a wedding present.

In August 1989, the Princess Royal and Phillips announced their intention to separate, as the marriage had been under strain for a number of years. The couple had rarely been seen in public together, and both were romantically linked with other people. They continued to share the custody of their children, and initially announced that &quot;there were no plans for divorce.&quot; Meanwhile, Phillips continued to work at the couple&#x27;s estate at Gatcombe Park. In 1991, a DNA test confirmed that Phillips had fathered a girl, Felicity Tonkin, born in August 1985 in New Zealand to art teacher Heather Tonkin. Phillips and Princess Anne divorced on 23 April 1992.

On 1 February 1997, Phillips married Sandy Pflueger, an American Olympic dressage rider. Their daughter Stephanie was born on 2 October 1997. She grew up at Aston Farm, Gatcombe Park, close to the family of Princess Anne, and served as a bridesmaid at the wedding of her half-sister Zara Tindall. In 2000, Phillips was appointed an Honorary Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Farmers.

On 3 May 2012, it was confirmed by Phillips&#x27; solicitors that Phillips and Pflueger had separated, intending to divorce, with Phillips becoming involved with American equestrian Lauren Hough.

Phillips&#x27; personal wealth is thought to be around £15–20 million. The settlement he received when his marriage to Princess Anne ended was described as &quot;modest&quot; and reported to be around &quot;$3 million&quot;.

On 19 September 2022, Philips was present at the committal service at St George&#x27;s Chapel for his former mother-in-law Elizabeth II.

<doc id="179628" wikidata="Q5683113" url="?curid=179628" title="Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America">
<text>Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA, pronounced ), formerly known as the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, is an American trade group representing companies in the pharmaceutical industry. Founded in 1958, PhRMA lobbies on behalf of pharmaceutical companies. PhRMA is headquartered in Washington, D.C.

The organization has lobbied fiercely against allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for Medicare recipients, and filed lawsuits against the drug price provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. At the state level, the organization has lobbied to prevent price limits and greater price transparency for drugs. The organization claims that higher prices incentivize research and development, even though pharmaceutical spending on marketing exceeds that spent on research, including off-label promotion that has resulted in settlements in the billions of dollars.

PhRMA has given substantial dark money donations to right-wing advocacy groups such as the American Action Network (which lobbied heavily against the Affordable Care Act), Americans for Prosperity, and Americans for Tax Reform.

The organization has also lobbied against lowering drug prices internationally. The most visible conflict has been over AIDS drugs in Africa. Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs for public health programs across Africa, the organization worked to minimize the effect of the Doha Declaration, which said that TRIPS should not prevent countries from dealing with public health crises and allowed for compulsory licenses. The organization also opposed a World Trade Organization TRIPS Agreement waiver during the COVID-19 pandemic, which would have reduced the price of COVID-19 vaccines for low-income countries.

==Membership==
=== Leadership ===
Daniel O&#x27;Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences is chairman of the PhRMA board. Albert Bourla, DVM, PhD, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer, is board chair-elect and Paul Hudson, Chief Executive Officer of Sanofi, is board treasurer.

Since 2015, the president of the organization has been Stephen J. Ubl. Previous leadership includes: John J. Castellani, formerly head of the Business Roundtable, a U.S. advocacy and lobbying group, Billy Tauzin, a former Republican congressman from Louisiana, and John J. Horan, former CEO and chairman of Merck &amp; Co.

=== Members ===
Current member companies include Alkermes, Amgen, Astellas Pharma, Bayer, Biogen, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, CSL Behring, Daiichi Sankyo, Eisai, Eli Lilly and Company, EMD Serono, Genentech, Genmab, Gilead Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline, Incyte, Ipsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lundbeck, Merck &amp; Co., Neurocrine Biosciences, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Otsuka Pharmaceutical, Pfizer, Sage Therapeutics, Sanofi, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and UCB.

==Programs==
SMARxT Disposal is a joint program run by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the American Pharmacists Association, and PhRMA to encourage consumers to properly dispose of unused medicines to avoid harm to the environment.

The Partnership for Prescription Assistance is a program by PhRMA and its member companies that connects patients in-need with information on low-cost and free prescription medication. PhRMA has in 2017 raised concerns over price increases for generic drugs out of patent by the company Marathon Pharmaceuticals over Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment.

The company has advocated abroad in South Africa regarding pharmaceutical drug intellectual property rules.

In 2017, the organization had revenue of $455 million, $128 million of which was spent on lobbying activities.

The organization has notably opposed market pricing strategies of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, deriding the firm as having a strategy &quot;reflective of a hedge fund&quot;.

In January 2018, the organization introduced the &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Cost&quot; website, which made the argument that much of the cost of medication goes to middlemen unassociated with pharmaceutical companies.

<doc id="179630" wikidata="Q863140" url="?curid=179630" title="Billy J. Kramer">
<text>William Howard Ashton (born 19 August 1943), known professionally as Billy J. Kramer, is an English pop singer. With The Dakotas, Kramer was managed by Brian Epstein during the 1960s and scored hits with several Lennon–McCartney compositions never recorded by the Beatles, among them the UK number one &quot;Bad to Me&quot; (1963). Kramer and the Dakotas had a further UK chart-topper in 1964 with &quot;Little Children&quot; and achieved U.S. success as part of the British Invasion. Since the end of the beat boom, Kramer has continued to record and perform. His autobiography, &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot;, was published in 2016.

==Early life and career==
Kramer grew up as the youngest of seven siblings and attended the St George of England Secondary School, Bootle. He then took up an engineering apprenticeship with British Railways and in his spare time played rhythm guitar in a group he had formed himself, before switching to become a vocalist. The performing name Kramer was chosen at random from a telephone directory. John Lennon suggested that the &quot;J&quot; be added to the name further to distinguish him by adding a &quot;tougher edge&quot;. Kramer soon came to the attention of Brian Epstein, ever on the look-out for new talent to add to his expanding roster of local artists. Kramer turned professional but his then backing group, the Coasters, were less keen, so Epstein sought out the services of a Manchester-based group, the Dakotas, a combo then backing Pete MacLaine.

Even then, the Dakotas would not join Kramer without a recording contract of their own. Once in place, the deal was set and both acts signed to Parlophone under George Martin. Collectively, they were named Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas to keep their own identities within the act. Once the Beatles broke through, the way was paved for a tide of Merseybeat and Kramer was offered the chance to cover &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret?&quot; first released by the Beatles on their own debut album, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. The track had been turned down by Shane Fenton (later known as Alvin Stardust) who was looking for a career-reviving hit.

==Success==
With record producer George Martin, the song &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret?&quot; was a number two UK Singles Chart hit in 1963, (but number one in some charts) and was backed by another tune otherwise unreleased by the Beatles, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be on My Way&quot;. After this impressive breakthrough another Lennon/McCartney pairing, &quot;Bad to Me&quot; c/w &quot;I Call Your Name&quot;, reached number one. It sold over a million copies and was awarded a gold disc. &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep You Satisfied&quot; ended the year with a respectable number four placing.

Kramer was given a series of songs specially written for him by Lennon and McCartney which launched him into stardom. &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep You Satisfied&quot;, &quot;From a Window&quot;, &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; (recorded by The Beatles themselves) and &quot;Bad to Me&quot; earned him appearances on the television programmes, &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; (hosted by Beatles manager Epstein) and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. (Kramer had also been offered Lennon/McCartney&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot; and recorded a version in October 1963. In the end, it was shelved and the song was instead given to the Fourmost. In the 1990s, a Kramer compilation album included his version, as well as some recording studio banter on which Lennon&#x27;s voice could be heard).

The Dakotas enjoyed Top 20 success in 1963 on their own with the Mike Maxfield composition &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;, an instrumental retitled &quot;The Cruel Surf&quot; in the US, which was subsequently covered by The Ventures as The Cruel Sea. This was followed by a George Martin creation, &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, in which an echo-laden piano played the melody alongside Maxfield&#x27;s guitar. But it missed out altogether and it was a year before their next release. All four tracks appeared on an EP later that year.

The three hits penned by Lennon and McCartney suggested that Kramer would always remain in the Beatles&#x27; shadow, unless he tried something different. Despite being advised against it, he turned down the offer of another Lennon/McCartney song, &quot;One and One Is Two&quot;, and insisted on recording the Stateside chart hit &quot;Little Children&quot;. It became his second chart topper and biggest hit. In the United States, &quot;Little Children&quot; was backed with &quot;Bad to Me&quot;. This was the only debut single of an act on the Hot 100, each of whose sides separately reached that chart&#x27;s The Top 10 (No. 7 and No. 9, respectively). &quot;From a Window&quot;, a Lennon/McCartney composition, was his second and final UK single of 1964 and became a Top Ten hit.

==After the peak==
The 1965 Kramer single &quot;It&#x27;s Gotta Last Forever&quot; signified a shift to a ballad approach. It failed to chart, though Kramer&#x27;s cover version of Bacharach and David&#x27;s &quot;Trains and Boats and Planes&quot; eclipsed Anita Harris&#x27; version in the UK, reaching number 12. All subsequent releases failed to chart.

The Dakotas&#x27; ranks were then strengthened by the inclusion of Mick Green, formerly a guitarist with the London band the Pirates who backed Johnny Kidd. This line-up cut a few tracks which were at odds with the balladeer&#x27;s usual fare. These included a take on &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot; and &quot;Sneakin&#x27; Around&quot;. The Dakotas&#x27; final outing whilst with Kramer was the blues-driven &quot;Oyeh!&quot;, but this also flopped.

==Latterly==

After releasing &quot;We&#x27;re Doing Fine&quot;, which also missed the charts, the singer and group parted company. Kramer, then lived in Rugby, Warwickshire, after marrying a local woman Ann Ginn there in 1968. He had a solo career over the next ten to fifteen years or so, working in cabaret and television with his new band, again from the Manchester area, consisting of Pete Heaton (bass), John Miller (drums) and Tim Randles (guitar) - this later saw changes with Bob Price now on bass and Roger Bell on guitar. In the late 1970s, Kramer teamed up with Bedford musicians Mike Austin (bass), Max Milligan (guitar) and John Dillon (percussion), the one constant member throughout the changes in musicians at this time was his sound engineer Stewart Oakes, performing cabaret in the UK and Europe, whilst also recording &quot;San Diego&quot; and &quot;Ships that Pass in the Night&quot; – after which Kramer eventually went to live in the United States.

The Dakotas re-formed in the late 1980s and recruited vocalist Eddie Mooney and session musician Toni Baker. They still tour and record. Other latter-day members are drummer Pete Hilton and guitarist Alan Clare.

In 1983, Kramer released a solo single on the RAK label, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Live on Memories&quot; / &quot;Stood Up&quot;, which failed to chart. The following year, 1984, he released &quot;Shootin&#x27; the Breeze&quot; / &quot;Doris Day Movie&quot; on &#x27;Mean Records&#x27;. Again, this failed to chart.

In 2005, Kramer recorded the song &quot;Cow Planet&quot; for &quot;Dog Train&quot;, the children&#x27;s album by Sandra Boynton. A long-term fan of Kramer, Boynton had sought him out for her project: in 1964, at the age of 11, &quot;Little Children&quot; became the first album she ever bought.

In late 2012, Kramer went back into the studio for the first time in years to record a new CD, &quot;I Won the Fight&quot;, which was released in 2013. The CD features some new songs written by Kramer, as well as some covers.

In 2013, Kramer provided the introduction to the graphic novel &quot;The Fifth Beatle&quot; by Vivek Tiwary. The book was released in November and spent several weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list, reaching No. 1 in its third week of release. He also released a new album, entitled &quot;I Won the Fight&quot;.

In 2015, Kramer was part of the British Invasion 50th Anniversary tour, performing in the US and the UK. The following year saw the publication of his autobiography &quot;Do You Want to Know A Secret&quot;, co-written with Alyn Shipton.
In February 2024 Billy J released a single “Are you with me” which charted on The Heritage Chart
