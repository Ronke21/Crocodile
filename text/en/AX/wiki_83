The name is believed to have connections with the Gopis (the cow herdesses or cowherds girls) of the Lord Krishna mythology. It is said that the area was once inhabited by cowherds and associated with pastoral activites, especially in the times of Mahabharata. This may refer to the cultural or historical ties with Lord Krishna worship, which had an influence on the region. Gwalior was the major commercial and trade route during Samudragupta regin. According to legend, modern day Gwalior city was founded in early 5th century (401 CE to 500 CE) after a local chieftain, Suraj Sen, who was cured of leprosy from a drink given to him by a holy man called Gwalipa. Suraj subsequently set up a city and fort and named them after Gwalipa.

The earliest historical record found at Gwalior is the Gwalior inscription of the Alchon Hun ruler Mihirakula. It describes Mihirakula&#x27;s father Toramana (493–515) as &quot;a ruler of the earth, of great merit, who was renowned by the name of the glorious Tôramâna; by whom, through (his) heroism that was specially characterized by truthfulness, the earth was governed with justice&quot;, and his Mihirakula as &quot;the lord of the earth&quot; as of 520 CE.

Around the 9th century, the Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty controlled Gwalior and during their rule, they constructed the Teli ka Mandir temple. The Kachchhapaghata dynasty ruled the area c.950 –c.1192 CE, leaving remarkable architectural works such as the Sasbahu Temples. In 1021, Gwalior was attacked by forces led by Mahmud Ghazni.

In 1231 Iltutmish, ruler of the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate, captured Gwalior after an 11-month-long effort and from then till the 13th century it remained under Muslim rule. In 1375, Raja Veer Singh was made the ruler of Gwalior and he founded the rule of the Tomar clan. During those years, Gwalior saw its golden period.The Jain Sculptures at Gwalior Fort were built under Tomar rule. Man Singh Tomar a Tomar Rajput made his dream palace, the Man Mandir Palace which is now a tourist attraction at Gwalior Fort. Babur described it as &quot;the pearl in the necklace of forts of India and not even the winds could touch its masts&quot;. The daily light and sound show organised there apprise about the history of the Gwalior Fort and Man Mandir Palace. By the 15th century, the city had a noted singing school which was attended by the prominent figure of Hindustani classical music, Tansen. After death of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb the Jat ruler Bhim Singh Rana captured Gwalior from Mughals.

When the troops did that, the shivling was automatically established in a field below the fort without any harm. Muslim Gazi told the emperor not to harm the shivling. In the late 18th century Scindias built a temple for that shivling, now known as Koteshwar Mahadev.
* Baba Kapoor- this place is 500 meters away from Ghas Mandi. This place was named Baba Kapoor because of saint Shah Abdul Gafoor.
* Kashi Naresh ki gali- this a 600-year-old residential street in Gwalior it was given name as Kashi Naresh ki gali because in the 14th century when the emperor of Kashi was defeated in war he was sent to exile by oppositions at that time Gwalior emperor and Kashi&#x27;s emperor were good friends when Kashi&#x27;s emperor told Gwalior&#x27;s emperor whole story, emperor gave him an entire street for living at that time which is now known as Kashi Naresh ki Gali. their family even now resides there in Kashi Naresh ki gali in Rajaji Ka Bada. (Meanings: naresh = king = rajaji; gali = street in Hindi language; bada = big area.)

=== Subcity ===

The name of Lashkar is a Persian word meaning &#x27;army&#x27; or &#x27;camp&#x27;, as this was originally the camp, and later the permanent capital, of the Scindia dynasty of Gwalior state. Lashkar was the capital of Madhya Bharat from 1950 to 1956.

&quot;Jiwaji Chowk&quot; is the central focus of Lashkar, with a large square, a former opera house, banks, tea, coffee and juice stands and a municipal market building. Thriving bazaars surround the chowk. Many jewellery shops are situated near &quot;Jayaji Chowk&quot;, also known as Maharaj Bada. A source of water for the city is Tighra Dam, built on the Saank river 20 km to the north. The Gajra Raja Medical College, founded in 1946 by the Maharaja Jiwaji Rao Scindia and the Maharani Vijayaraje Scindia, is situated in Lashkar on Palace Road, near Katora Taal, together with a group of hospitals.
Jai Vilas Palace, patterned on the French palace of Versailles, is located here.

=== Morar Cantonment ===
Morar Cantonment, formerly a separate town, lies east of the old city. It was formerly a British military cantonment. Morar is generally considered a rural farming town. The area is known as the &quot;green part&quot; of Gwalior because much of the area is still rural.

Morar was the scene of the most serious uprising in Central India. On 1 June 1858, Jayajirao led his forces to Morar to fight a rebel army led by Tatya Tope, Rani Lakshmibai and Rao Sahib. This army had 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 12 guns while he had only 1,500 cavalry, his bodyguard of 600 men and 8 guns. In this attack, the rebel cavalry took the guns and most of the Gwalior forces except the bodyguard went over to the rebels (some deserted). The Maharaja and the remainder fled without stopping until they reached the British garrison at Agra. By 1900 it had become a centre for local trade and had an important training industry, with a population of 19,179 in 1901.

The Sun Temple is situated in Morar at Residency Road.

The cantonment area makes up a large area of Morar which contains official residences for the Indian Army. It has many canteens for Army personnel. Saint Paul&#x27;s School and Pragati Vidyapeeth School are nearby. There is an air force base in the Pinto Park region.

=== Thatipur ===
Thatipur is said to have got its name from State Army Unit 34, which once resided there. Gandhi Road divides Thatipur into two areas. Morar at one end of the road and Balwant Nagar on the other.

Thatipur primarily consists of residential areas like Darpan Colony, Madhav Rao Scindhiya Enclave, the government blocks, Vivek Nagar, and Suresh Nagar. Places of note are the Dwarikadhish Mandir, Bhagwan colony, Tomar building, Chauhan Pyaau (The Chauhan family), Galla Kothar, Ramkrishna Aashram, Saraswati Nagar, Govindpuri, Gayatri Vihar, Shakti Vihar, Shakuntalapuri, Dushyant Nagar, Shanti Vihar, and Mayur market along with Sai Baba Mandir in Shakti Vihar colony.

== Architecture ==
=== Gwalior Fort ===


At the heart of Gwalior is Gwalior Fort of the Tomara dynasty. This structure was reputed to be one of the most structurally sound forts of India, having been improved by Raja Man Singh Tomar where a previous structure existed. It occupies an isolated rock outcrop. The hill is steepened to make it virtually unscalable and is surrounded by high walls which enclose buildings from several periods. The old town of Gwalior lies at the eastern base of the fortress. Lashkar, founded by Daulat Rao Scindia, formerly a separate town that originated as a military camp, lies to the south, and Morar, also a formerly separate town, lies to the east. Gwalior, Lashkar and Morar are part of the Gwalior Municipal Corporation.

The Fort, popularly called &quot;the Gibraltar of India&quot;, overlooks the city. The Emperor Babur reputedly described it as &quot;the pearl in the necklace of the forts of Hind&quot;. This fort&#x27;s architecture is unique. It displays a Chinese influence on Indian architecture, as Chinese dragons have been crafted at the hilt of the pillars. This influence was due to trade between China and India at the time of the fort&#x27;s construction.

After the death of Sher Shah Suri in 1545, who was ruling North India at that time, his son Islam Shah shifted his capital from Delhi to Gwalior and constructed &#x27;Sher Shah Mandir&#x27; (or &#x27;Sher Shah Fort&#x27;) in his father&#x27;s memory. Islam Shah operated from Gwalior until his death in 1553. Islam Shah had appointed the Hindu warrior &#x27;Hemu&#x27; or Hem Chandra Vikramaditya as his Prime Minister in Sher Shah Fort for the first time, who later on became the Hem Chandra Vikramaditya king at Delhi and established &#x27;Hindu Raj&#x27; in North India.

In the east of the city are two examples of early Mughal architecture: the mausoleum of the 16th century Sufi Saint Ghous Mohammed and the tomb of Mian Tansen, a singer and one of the &#x27;Nine Jewels&#x27; of the Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s court. Right next to them is the Gujari Mahal, built by Tomar Rajput King Man Singh Tomar on demand of his consort Gujar princess Mrignayani.
Close to the heart of the city is Jai Vilas Palace of the Scindia dynasty, patterned on the palace of Versailles. It combines Tuscan, Italian and Corinthian styles of architecture.
Historically and architecturally, Gwalior is interesting first as an ancient seat of Jain worship; second for its example of palace architecture of the Hindu period between 1486 and 1516; and third as an historic fortress. Many historical places are found near the Dabra-Bhitarwar Road. Prior to the founding of Gwalior, the region was also known by its ancient name of &quot;Gopasetra&quot;. Gwalior had an institutional seat of the Bhattarakas of Kashtha Sangh and later Mula Sangh.

=== Gopachal ===

Gopachal Parvat is situated on the mountainous terrain at the slopes of Gwalior Fort. Gopachal Parvat contains unique statues of Jain Tirthankaras. The idol of Parshvanath seated on a lotus (carved out of a single stone) is the largest in the world, towering at in height and in breadth. There is a series of 26 Jain statues in a single line. Built between 1398 and 1536 by Tomar kings, these Jain &quot;Tirthankar&quot; statues are one of a kind in architecture.

=== Siddhachal Caves ===
Jain rock-cut sculptures of Siddhachal Caves – A striking part of the Jain remains at Gwalior is a series of caves or rock-cut sculptures, excavated in the rock on all sides, and numbering nearly a hundred, great and small. Most of them are mere niches to hold statues, though some are cells that may have been originally intended for residences. According to inscriptions, they were all excavated within a short period of about thirty-three years, between 1441 and 1474. One of the colossal figures is high, taller than any other in northern India.

=== Sas-Bahu Temples ===
=== Teli Temple ===

Teli Temple or in Hindi Teli Ka Mandir – A structure of about 100 feet, Teli Ka Mandir in Gwalior Fort distinguishes itself from the other compositions of its time because of its unique architecture. The temple bears a close resemblance to the temple of Prathihara Vishnu, and is filled with images of coiled serpents, passionate couples, river goddesses, and a flying Garuda. The temple architecture follows the Indo-Aryan and Nagara styles and is believed to be among the oldest constructions in the fort. The Telikā Mandir, or &#x27;oil-man&#x27;s temple&#x27;, owes its name to Teli, a term for an oil grinder or oil dealer. Many suggestions have been put forward to explain this name historically, but in fact the name is not old, the temple being used for processing oil before the British occupied the fort and used the building, albeit temporarily, as a coffee shop. The Telikā Mandir is the loftiest temple among all the buildings in Gwalior Fort with a height of about 30 meters. The temple consists of a &quot;garba griha&quot;, that is, sanctum proper for the deity, and an &quot;antarala&quot; to enter into the temple. It can be approached by a flight of steps provided on the eastern side. The most striking feature of the temple is the wagon-vaulted roof, a form used over rectangular shrines which normally accommodated a row of Mother Goddesses. The goddesses from the interior vanished centuries ago and have not been traced. The exterior walls of the temple are decorated with sculptures, many of which are damaged; the niches, shaped like temples, are empty. The building carries a dedicatory inscription to the goddess in a niche on the southern side, but otherwise does not have any history. The architectural style points to a date in the late 8th Century. The entrance gateway on the eastern side is a later addition of the British period, made by Major Keith in 1881. It was built as a way of saving various historic pillars and other pieces no longer in their original context.

<doc id="184672" wikidata="Q2325522" url="?curid=184672" title="Father Time">
<text>Father Time is a personification of time. In recent centuries he is usually depicted as an elderly bearded man, sometimes with wings, dressed in a robe and carrying a scythe and an hourglass or other timekeeping device.

As an image, the origins of &quot;Father Time&quot; are varied. The ancient Greeks themselves began to associate &quot;Chronos Protogenos&quot; with the god Cronos, who had the attribute of a harvester&#x27;s sickle. The Romans equated Cronos with Saturn, who also had a sickle, and was treated as an old man, often with a crutch. The wings and hourglass were early Renaissance additions and he eventually became a companion of the Grim Reaper, personification of Death, often taking his scythe. He may have as an attribute a snake with its tail in its mouth, an ancient Egyptian symbol of eternity.
==New Year==
Around New Year&#x27;s Eve, the media (in particular editorial cartoons) use the convenient trope of Father Time as the personification of the previous year (or &quot;the Old Year&quot;) who typically &quot;hands over&quot; the duties of time to the equally allegorical Baby New Year (or &quot;the New Year&quot;) or who otherwise characterizes the preceding year. In these depictions, Father Time is usually depicted wearing a sash with the old year&#x27;s date on it.

Time (in his allegorical form) is often depicted revealing or unveiling the allegorical Truth, sometimes at the expense of a personification of Falsehood, Fraud, or Envy. This theme is related to the idea of &quot;veritas filia temporis&quot; (Time is the father of Truth).

==In the arts==

Father Time is an established symbol in numerous cultures and appears in a variety of art and media. In some cases, they appear specifically as Father Time while in other cases they may have another name (such as Saturn), but the characters demonstrate the attributes which Father Time has acquired over the centuries.

<doc id="184675" wikidata="Q2663091" url="?curid=184675" title="List of entities that have issued postage stamps (A–E)">
<text>This is a list of entities that have issued postage stamps at some point since stamps were introduced in 1840. The list includes any kind of governmental entity or officially approved organisation that has issued distinctive types of stamp . These include post offices in foreign countries and postal services organised by military occupations, international organisations, colonies, provinces, city-states and some revolutionary movements. The list includes members of the Universal Postal Union that are also listed at postal organisations.

Many of these entities are historic and some were very short-lived indeed. Philatelists and stamp collectors often refer to the entities that no longer issue stamps as dead countries.

The dates are the generally agreed-upon dates of first and last stamp issues. &quot;Date of issue&quot; is taken to mean the date when a particular type or variation was issued but its usage would often continue for many years. For example, although an entity may have issued its last stamp in 1951, actual usage may have continued until 1960: in that case, 1951 is the last stamp issue date.

Besides the period of which stamps were issued in the name of a particular entity, the list under that entity also bears any other name in which stamps had been issued for territory, name of any other entity which had had its stamps used in that territory, or new names which had subsequently replaced the name of that entity, together with their respective periods.
==List==
The list has been comprehensively revised to include extra entities and to direct the links away from the country articles to the (proposed) philatelic articles.

<text>Whataburger is an American regional fast food restaurant chain, headquartered and based in San Antonio, Texas, that specializes in hamburgers. Founded by Harmon Dobson and Paul Burton, it opened its first restaurant in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1950. Family-owned by the Dobsons until 2019, the chain is now managed by the private equity firm BDT &amp; MSD Partners; the Dobson family still holds a small stake.

When the company changed ownership in 2019, there were more than 670 locations in Texas and over 150 in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and the Southern United States, of which 126 are franchised.

Whataburger was known for many years for its distinct A-framed orange-and-white-stripe-roofed buildings. The first A-frame restaurant, the 24th Whataburger to open, was built in Odessa, Texas in 1961. Although the company highlighted the restaurant as an unofficial historical landmark, it was demolished in 2019 and replaced by a new building.

The company&#x27;s focus is on ground beef burgers, and include the Whataburger, the Whataburger Jr., the Triple Meat Whataburger, the Bacon &amp; Cheese Whataburger, and the Justaburger. Non-beef options, such as the Whatachick&#x27;n, are also available. Breakfast is served during morning hours, including biscuits, pork sausage, bacon, and eggs.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1950, Harmon Dobson and Paul Burton were looking to open a hamburger restaurant. Dobson&#x27;s goal was to &quot;make a better burger that took two hands to hold and tasted so good that when you took a bite you would say &#x27;What a burger!&#x27;&quot; In June 1950, Dobson was granted the Whataburger trademark. In August of that year they opened their first location on Ayers Street in Corpus Christi, Texas, across from Del Mar College. The store sold burgers for 25 cents, and also sold drinks and chips.

In 1951, Burton and Dobson ended their partnership after arguments concerning Dobson&#x27;s price raise of the burger from 25 to 30 cents. Burton settled with owning the Whataburger franchises in San Antonio, Texas. Months later, prices for burgers were raised to 35 cents. In 1952, Dobson opened a location in Kingsville, Texas, the first store outside of Corpus Christi. In 1953, Joe Andrews, Sr. became the first non-founder franchise owner with a location in Alice, Texas. In 1959, the first Whataburger restaurant outside Texas opened in Pensacola, Florida.

===1960s and 1970s===
By 1960, there were stores operating across Texas, Florida, and Tennessee. Inspired by his love for flying, Dobson designed the orange and white striped A-frame store in Odessa, Texas, in 1961.

In 1962, the company added French fries and hot pies to its menu. In 1963, it expanded to Arizona and totaled 26 stores. In 1965, it estimated selling 15,000 burgers daily in the Texas Coastal Bend area. In 1967, the company commissioned the &quot;Flying W&quot; company logo, and the company had expanded to 40 restaurants in four states.

On April 11, 1967, Dobson and an associate died in an airplane crash, and Dobson&#x27;s widow, Grace, took control of the business. In 1969, Grace became chairman of the board.

In 1971, the company opened its first drive-through store, and in 1972, it opened its 100th store. In 1974, the A-frame design was changed to a &quot;Modern A-Frame&quot; to accommodate drive-thrus and larger dining rooms.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980, the company opened its 300th store. In 1982, three Corpus Christi stores began 24/7 service. In 1983, the company added Breakfast on a Bun, the Whatachick&#x27;n sandwich and breakfast taquitos to its menu. In 1987, it opened its 400th store, and also shut down operations in California.

In 1993, Harmon and Grace Dobson&#x27;s son, Tom, became the CEO and President. The menu expanded, offering Whatameal packages, cookies and biscuits, and chicken strips. The company celebrated its 500th store opening in 1995, and was noted as the country&#x27;s eighth-largest hamburger chain.

On May 6, 1999, the company opened &quot;Whataburger by the Bay&quot; on Shoreline Blvd in Corpus Christi. It is the largest Whataburger store at . The site includes a life-size bronze statue of Harmon Dobson.

A Whataburger facility, complete with familiar a-frame design and the company logo, appeared routinely in the popular animated TV series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;.

===2000–present===
On August 8, 2000, Whataburger celebrated its 50th anniversary with 575 operating stores. In 2001, during the 77th Texas Legislative Session, a bill was passed proclaiming Whataburger to be a Texas Treasure.

In 2003, it hired Austin-based advertising firm McGarrah Jessee, which created an advertising campaign featuring the gravelly voice of Ohio actor William Bassett. In 2007, the company achieved 700 stores in ten states with annual revenue of $1 billion.

In October 2011, the company changed its television ads from Bassett&#x27;s voiceovers to &quot;documentary-style ads employees and customers using their own words to describe what makes Whataburger special.&quot; By the end of the year, it had 728 stores operating in ten states. The Dobson family owned 611 stores, and the other &quot;117 are owned and operated by about 25 franchisees.&quot;

On May 16, 2019 American City Business Journals reported that Whataburger confirmed it has hired Morgan Stanley for a possible sale of the company.

On June 14, 2019, the Dobson family sold its majority stake in the company to BDT Capital, a Chicago-based investment company. The family cited long term expansion plans as one reason for the sale. Much of the current leadership will remain, but they will take on new roles within the company. Ed Nelson, currently serving as chief financial officer and controller, was promoted to president. The company said that Whataburger&#x27;s headquarters will remain in San Antonio.

On August 1, 2020, Ed Nelson was promoted to CEO of Whataburger.

Beginning in 2021, the company expanded to the Midwest with locations around the Kansas City metropolitan area and the Wichita, Kansas metropolitan area, with multiple locations in between the cities, and also as far north as St. Joseph On January 5, 2022, the first of 8 locations in Middle Tennessee opened in Hermitage, ending a decades long absence in the Nashville area.

In March 2022, Whataburger announced it would be opening locations in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The first one opened in November in Kennesaw.

In April 2023, the town of Flower Mound, Texas approved zoning for the first Whataburger in the city. At that time, Flower Mound was the largest city in Texas without a Whataburger.

As of May 2024, Whataburger has announced plans for six North Carolina locations and nine South Carolina locations.

==Retail products==
Due to the success of selling Whataburger sauces at H-E-B since 2014, the company announced it will offer 1-pound packages of bacon at H-E-B and Central Market stores.

Whataburger sells its line of condiments in 14oz and 20oz squeeze bottles. It also sells jars of its picante sauce and salsa verde, as well as boxed pancake mix.

==Corporate affairs==

=== Leadership and operations ===
Whataburger generated more than $3 billion in revenue in 2022 at more than 900 restaurant locations in 14 states, as well as from the sale of various retail products in grocery stores throughout the U.S. It employed approximately 50,000 people as of 2022. The company is led by president and CEO Ed Nelson, executive vice president and chief operating officer Debbie Stroud, executive vice president and chief marketing officer Rich Scheffler, executive vice president and chief legal officer Elena Kraus, executive vice president and chief financial officer Janelle Sykes, executive vice president and chief development officer James Turcotte, senior vice president and chief people officer Peggy Rubenzer, senior vice president and chief information officer Joe Shannon, and chief strategy and supply chain officer Alexander Ivannikov.

===Headquarters and offices===
In 2009 the company moved from its long time base in Corpus Christi to a new headquarters at 300 Concord Plaza Drive, a building in San Antonio.

Previously the corporate headquarters were in Corpus Christi with the regional offices&#x27; in Corpus Christi, Houston, Irving, and Phoenix.

After Hurricane Ike hit the Texas Coast in 2008, the company began considering moving its headquarters from Corpus Christi. On Friday November 21, 2008, the company announced it was permanently moving to San Antonio, and that the Corpus Christi office would remain open indefinitely to help ease the transition. The company chose San Antonio because of a larger talent pool for potential employees, increased protection from hurricanes, and cost-efficient office space.

In March 2009 the company purchased the Concord Plaza development from HDG Mansur. The company stated that it chose Concord Plaza for its proximity to neighborhoods and schools attractive to its employees, and its proximity to San Antonio International Airport. Tesoro, which leased space in the development, was moving to another facility at the time Whataburger bought the building. Whataburger planned to move 250 of its corporate positions to San Antonio, with over 60% of the employees coming from Corpus Christi and the rest hired locally.

==What-A-Burger and similar stores==

Whataburger is sometimes confused with the What-A-Burger (hyphenated) chain of family-operated restaurants in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. The first What-A-Burger store opened in 1950 by entrepreneur Jack Branch near Newport News, Virginia, at Newport News Circle (intersection of Jefferson Avenue and U.S. Route 258) in the former Warwick County. What-A-Burger and Whataburger were unaware of each other&#x27;s existence several states apart until around 1970, when there was some correspondence. However, no legal actions took place until 2002–2003, when both companies sued each other over the alleged trademark infringement. The Court of Appeals, in 2004, eventually decided the Texas Whataburger had a legitimate trademark; but the Virginia chain did not harm the much larger Texas-based chain in any way or cause any reasonable public confusion: &quot;There is no evidence — nor can we imagine any — that consumers are currently likely to be confused about whether the burgers served by Virginia W-A-B come from Texas or Virginia.&quot;

A second restaurant chain based in North Carolina, named What-A-Burger Drive-In, owned by Eb and Michael Bost, was not a party to the lawsuit, but under case law procedures, it would also retain its name. It visibly numbered their stores starting from #1 in Kannapolis, North Carolina, to #15 in Concord, North Carolina, six of which remain in operation . The Texas chain filed suit in federal court June 11, 2024 after its announcement that it would add North Carolina locations. The suit alleges three restaurants located in Mount Pleasant, Norwood, North Carolina and Raleigh in North Carolina started using the name &quot;What-A-Burger #13&quot; after the Texas chain&#x27;s copyright registration.

There is also an unrelated local restaurant also called What-A-Burger in West Columbia, South Carolina founded in 1953.

==Sponsorships==
Whataburger has sponsored a variety of music festivals. The company has also sponsored sports through the Whataburger Sports Complex in Kilgore, Texas, the Arizona Soccer Association, and David Starr Racing, among others.

In June 2024, Whataburger signed an endorsement deal with Bobby Witt Jr., the Texas-native shortstop for the Kansas City Royals; the 2024 MLB batting champion served as a prominent brand ambassador for Whataburger. On 14 December 2024, a pop-up replica of Whataburger rebranded as “Wittaburger”, was present at the wedding reception of Bobby Witt Jr. and his wife Maggie Black.

<text>The papal tiara is a crown that is worn by popes of the Catholic Church from as early as the 8th century to the mid–20th century. It was last used by Pope Paul VI in 1963, and only at the beginning of his reign.

The name &quot;tiara&quot; refers to the entire headpiece, including the various crowns, circlets, and diadems that have adorned it through the ages, while the three-tiered form that it took in the 14th century is also called the triregnum or the triple crown, and sometimes as the triple tiara.

From 1143 to 1963, the papal tiara was solemnly placed on the pope&#x27;s head during a papal coronation. The surviving papal tiaras are all in the triple form, the oldest from 1572. A representation of the triregnum combined with two crossed keys of Saint Peter is used as a symbol of the papacy and appears on papal documents, buildings and insignia, and on the flag of Vatican City. Actual use of the papal tiara has declined since the reign of Pope Paul VI, the last pope to have a coronation ceremony. Starting with Pope Benedict XVI, popes have also stopped incorporating a papal tiara into their Coat of Arms.

==History==
===Origins===

The papal tiara originated from a conical Phrygian cap or frigium. Shaped like a candle-extinguisher, the papal tiara and the episcopal mitre were identical in their early forms.

Names used for the papal tiara in the 8th and 9th centuries include , , and .

===Crowns===
A circlet of linen or cloth of gold at the base of the tiara developed into a metal crown, which by about 1300 became two crowns. The first of these appeared at the base of the traditional white papal headgear in the 9th century. When the popes assumed temporal power in the Papal States, the base crown became decorated with jewels to resemble the crowns of princes. Innocent III is represented with an early tiara in a fresco at Sacro Speco and on a mosaic from Old Saint Peter&#x27;s, now in the Museo di Roma. A similar tiara, conical and with only one crown, is seen worn by pope Clement IV in frescoes from the 13th century in Pernes-les-Fontaines, France.

The second crown is said to have been added by Pope Boniface VIII as signifying both his spiritual and temporal power, since he declared that God had set him over kings and kingdoms. Boniface VIII&#x27;s tiara is represented with two crowns in his statues and tomb by Arnolfo di Cambio. The addition of a third crown is attributed to Pope Benedict XI (1303–1304) or Pope Clement V (1305–1314), and one such tiara was listed in an inventory of the papal treasury in 1316 (see &quot;Tiara of Saint Sylvester&quot;, below). The first years of the 16th century saw the addition of a small orb and cross to top the tiara.
The third crown was added to the papal tiara during the Avignon Papacy (1309–1378), giving rise to the form called the triregnum.

After Pope Clement V at Avignon, various versions of the three-crown tiara have been worn by popes also in Rome down to Pope Paul VI, who was crowned with one in 1963.

===Tiara of Saint Sylvester===
Lord Twining wrote of a tiara of Pope Boniface VIII that became known as the Tiara of Saint Sylvester:

Twining also notes the various allegorical meanings attributed to the three crowns of the papal tiara, but concludes that &quot;it seems more likely that the symbolism is suggested by the idea that took shape in the 13th and 14th centuries that the Emperor was crowned with three crowns—the silver crown of Germany at Aix-la-Chapelle, the iron crown of Lombardy at Milan or Monza and the golden imperial crown at Rome and therefore the Pope, too, should wear three crowns.&quot;

===Lappets ()===
Like a bishop&#x27;s mitre, a papal tiara has attached to it two lappets, a pair of streamers or pendants that in Latin are called or . These are usually attached at the rear of the tiara, again as on a bishop&#x27;s mitre, although the mosaic of Pope Clement VIII wearing a triregnum shows them placed forward of the ears. All extant tiaras have them placed at the rear. The lappets, sometimes called &quot;&quot; according to the 2nd definition of the word, are likely relics of the cord used to secure the original form of linen cap or turban around a bishop&#x27;s head.

The 1911 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; describes the lappets on a bishop&#x27;s mitre as trimmed on the ends with red fringe.

==Abandonment of the tiara==

Pope Paul VI was crowned with a tiara at the papal coronation. As happened sometimes with previous popes, a new tiara was used, donated by the city of Milan, where he was archbishop before his election. It was not covered in jewels and precious gems, and was sharply cone-shaped. It was also distinctly heavier than the Palatine Tiara previously in use. Near the end of the third session of the Second Vatican Council in 1964, Paul VI descended the steps of the papal throne in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and ascended to the altar, on which he laid the tiara as a sign of the renunciation of human glory and power in keeping with the renewed spirit of the council. It was announced that the tiara would be sold and the money obtained would be given to charity. The tiara was purchased by Catholics in the United States and is now kept in the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. It is on permanent display in Memorial Hall along with the stole that Pope John XXIII wore at the opening of the Second Vatican Council.

Paul VI&#x27;s abandonment of use of one of the most striking symbols of the papacy was highly controversial with many Traditionalist Catholics, some of whom continue to campaign for its reinstatement. Certain voices went so far as to brand Paul VI an antipope, arguing that no valid pope would surrender the papal tiara.

His immediate successor, Pope John Paul I, decided against a coronation, replacing it with an &quot;inauguration&quot;. It was officialized in 1996 within the apostolic constitution after which Benedict XVI and Pope Francis did not have a coronation rite with the Papal Tiara. After John Paul I&#x27;s sudden death, Pope John Paul II told the congregation at his inauguration: &quot;This is not the time to return to a ceremony and an object considered, wrongly, to be a symbol of the temporal power of the Popes.&quot;

Paul VI&#x27;s 1975 Apostolic Constitution on the manner of electing the Pope, still envisaged that his successors would be crowned. Pope John Paul II, in his 1996 Apostolic Constitution , removed all mention of a papal coronation, replacing it with a reference to an &quot;inauguration&quot;. The use of Papal Tiara in solemn ceremonies was left by Paul VI.

Though not currently worn as part of papal regalia, the papal tiara still appears on the coat of arms of the Holy See and the flag of Vatican City. Later in his reign John Paul II approved depictions of his arms without the tiara, as with the mosaic floor piece towards the entrance of St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, where an ordinary mitre takes the place of the tiara. Otherwise, until the reign of Benedict XVI the tiara was also the ornament surmounting a Pope&#x27;s personal coat of arms, as a tasseled hat (under which a 1969 Instruction of the Holy See forbade the placing of a mitre, a second hat) surmounted those of other prelates. Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s personal coat of arms replaced the tiara with a mitre containing three levels reminiscent of the three tiers on the papal tiara. The mitre was retained on Pope Francis&#x27; personal coat of arms.

In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated the document that confirmed the choice of Pope John Paul II to refuse the tiara and the incoronation rite.

In May 2011, Pope Benedict XVI received a special tiara by Dieter Philippi, a German chief executive officer of a telecommunication company who had commissioned the gift from an artisan workshop located in Sofia.

Each year, a large papal tiara is placed on the head of the famous bronze statue of Saint Peter in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica from the vigil of the Feast of the Cathedra of Saint Peter on 22 February until the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June. This custom was not observed in 2006, but was reintroduced in 2007.

==Design==

Although often referred to as Papal Tiara, historically there have been many, and 22 remain in existence. Many of the earlier papal tiaras (most notably the tiaras of Pope Julius II and that attributed to Pope Silvester I) were destroyed, dismantled or seized by invaders (most notably by Berthier&#x27;s army in 1798), or by popes themselves; Pope Clement VII had all the tiaras and papal regalia melted down in 1527 to raise the 400,000 ducats ransom demanded by the occupying army of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Over twenty silver tiaras exist, of which the earliest, the sole survivor of 1798, was made for Pope Gregory XIII in the 16th century. On 21 March 1800 as Rome was in the hands of the French, Pius VII was crowned in exile, in Venice, with a papier-mâché tiara, for which ladies of Venice gave up their jewels.

Many tiaras were donated to the papacy by world leaders or heads of states, including Queen Isabella II of Spain, William I (German Emperor), Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and Napoleon I of France. The tiara provided by the last was made from elements of former papal tiaras destroyed after the capture of Rome, and was given to Pius VII as a &#x27;wedding gift&#x27; to mark Napoleon&#x27;s own marriage to Empress Josephine on the eve of his imperial coronation. Others were a gift to a newly elected pope from the See which they had held before their election, or on the occasion of the jubilee of their ordination or election.

In some instances, various cities sought to outdo each other in the beauty, value and size of the tiaras they provided to popes from their region. Examples include tiaras given to Popes John XXIII and Paul VI, the former by John&#x27;s home region, the latter by Paul&#x27;s previous archiepiscopal see of Milan on their election to the papacy.

Popes were not restricted to a particular tiara: for example, photographs show Pope John XXIII, on different occasions, wearing the tiara presented to him in 1959, Pope Pius IX&#x27;s 1877 tiara, and Pope Pius XI&#x27;s 1922 tiara.

Pope Paul VI, whose bullet-shaped tiara is one of the most unusual in design, was the last pope to wear a papal tiara (though any of his successors could, if they wished, revive the custom). Most surviving tiaras are on display in the Vatican, though some were sold off or donated to Catholic bodies. Some of the more popular or historic tiaras, such as the 1871 Belgian tiara, the 1877 tiara and the 1903 golden tiara, have been sent around the world as part of a display of historic Vatican items. Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;Milan tiara&quot; was donated to and is on display in the crypt church of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., United States of America.

===Shape===

Most of the surviving (three-crown) papal tiaras have the shape of a circular beehive, with its central core made of silver. Some were sharply conical, others bulbous. Except for that of Pope Paul VI, all were heavily bejewelled. The three crowns are marked by golden decorations, sometimes in the form of crosses, sometimes in the shape of leaves. Most are surmounted by a cross set above a monde (globe), representing the universal sovereignty of Christ.

Each tiara had attached to the back two lappets; highly decorated strips of cloth embroidered with golden thread, bearing the coat of arms or another symbol of the pope to whom the tiara had been given.

There are two rather unusual tiaras: the papier-mâché tiara made when Pope Pius VII was elected and crowned in exile, and the one made for Pope Paul VI in 1963, which is somewhat bullet-shaped, contains few jewels and, instead of being adorned by three coronets, is marked with three parallel circles and has a double-tiered crown at its base.

The tiara given to Pope Pius IX in 1877 by the Vatican&#x27;s Palatine Honor Guard in honour of his Jubilee is strikingly similar in design to the earlier tiara of Gregory XVI. It remained a particularly popular crown, worn by, among others, Pope Pius XI, Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII. Pope Pius XI&#x27;s 1922 crown, in contrast was much less decorated and much more conical in shape.

===Weight===
Except for the papier-mâché tiara, the lightest tiara was that made for Pope John XXIII in 1959. It weighed just over , as did the 1922 tiara of Pope Pius XI. In contrast, the bullet-shaped tiara of Pope Paul VI weighed . The heaviest papal tiara in the papal collection is the 1804 tiara donated by Napoleon I to celebrate both his marriage to Josephine and his coronation as French emperor. It weighs . However it was never worn, as its width was made, some suspected deliberately, too small for Pope Pius VII to wear.

A number of popes deliberately had new tiaras made because they found those in the collection either too small, too heavy, or both. Rather than use the papier-mâché tiara, Pope Gregory XVI had a new lightweight tiara made in the 1840s. In the 1870s, Pope Pius IX, then in his eighties, found the other tiaras too heavy to wear and that of his predecessor, Pope Gregory, too small, so he had a lightweight tiara made also. In 1908 Pope Pius X had another lightweight tiara made as he found that the normal tiaras in use were too heavy, while the lightweight ones did not fit comfortably.

New methods of manufacture in the 20th century enabled the creation of lighter normal tiaras, producing the tiaras of Pius XI and John XXIII. That, combined with the existence of a range of lightweight tiaras from earlier popes, meant that no pope since Pius X in 1908 needed to make his own special lightweight tiara.

===Symbolism===
There is no certainty about what the three crowns of the tiara symbolise, as is evident from the multitude of interpretations that have been and still are proposed. Some link it to the threefold authority of the &quot;Supreme Pontiff: Universal Pastor (top), Universal Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction (middle) and Temporal Power (bottom)&quot;. Others interpret the three tiers as meaning &quot;father of princes and kings, ruler of the world, vicar of Christ&quot;. The words that were used when popes were crowned were: (&quot;Receive the tiara adorned with three crowns and know that thou art father of princes and kings, ruler of the world, vicar on earth of our Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom is honour and glory for ever and ever&quot;).

Yet others have associated it with the threefold office of Christ, who is Priest, Prophet and King, or &quot;teacher, lawmaker and judge&quot;. Another traditional interpretation was that the three crowns refer to the &quot;Church Militant on earth&quot;, the &quot;Church Suffering after death and before heaven&quot;, and the &quot;Church Triumphant in eternal reward&quot;. Yet another interpretation suggested by Archbishop Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, who designed Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s tiara-less coat of arms, was &quot;order, jurisdiction and magisterium&quot;, while a further theory links the three tiers to the &quot;celestial, human and terrestrial worlds,&quot; which the pope is supposed to symbolically link. Lord Twining suggested that just as the Holy Roman Emperors were crowned three times as king of Germany, king of Italy and Roman emperor, so the popes, to stress the equality of their spiritual authority to the temporal authority of the emperor, chose to be crowned with a tiara bearing three crowns.

==Use==

The papal tiara was never worn for liturgical celebrations, such as Mass. At such functions the Pope, like other bishops, wore a mitre. However, a tiara was worn during the solemn entrance and departure processions, and one or more could be placed on the altar during the elaborately ceremonial Pontifical High Mass.

The tiara was thus worn in formal ceremonial processions, and on other occasions when the pope was carried on the , a portable throne whose use was ended by Pope John Paul II immediately after his election in October 1978. His short-lived predecessor, John Paul I, also chose initially not to use it, but relented when informed that without it the people could not see him. The papal tiara was also worn when a pope gave his traditional Christmas and Easter blessing (&quot;to the City and the World&quot;) from the balcony of St Peter&#x27;s – the only religious ceremony at which the tiara was worn.

===Coronation===
The most famous occasion when the tiara was used was the papal coronation, a six-hour ceremony, when the new pope was carried in state on the (portable throne), with attendants fanning the pontiff with ostrich-feathered to the location of the coronation. Traditionally, coronations took place in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

At the moment of the coronation, the new pope was crowned with the words:

Pope Paul VI opted for a significantly shorter ceremony. As with all other modern coronations, the ceremony itself was only symbolic, as the person involved became Pope and Bishop of Rome the moment he accepted his canonical election in the papal conclave. The two subsequent popes (John Paul I and John Paul II) abandoned the monarchial coronation, opting instead for a coronation-less investiture. In 2005, Pope Benedict XVI took a step further and removed the tiara from his papal coat of arms, replacing it with a mitre.

==Related uses==
Only one other Catholic see uses the tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon was created in 1716 and has been held by the archbishop of Lisbon since 1740. The coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, while that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff. The Archbishop of Benevento also uses the tiara in its coat of arms.

The 16th-century Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent commissioned Venetian craftsmen to make a 4-tiered tiara modeled on the papal design, to demonstrate that his power and authority as Caliph exceeded that of the Pope. This was a most atypical piece of headgear for an Ottoman sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors. It was crowned with an enormous feather.

Conversely, the papal coronation ceremony, in which the Pope was fanned with (long fans of ostrich feathers) and carried on the (portable throne), was based on the Byzantine imperial ceremonies witnessed in medieval Constantinople.

==Tarot cards==
Medieval tarot cards included a card showing a woman wearing a papal tiara and known as the &quot;Popess or Papess&quot; or the &quot;High Priestess&quot;. The meaning and symbolism of the card is uncertain. The crowned woman has variously been identified as Pope Joan (who, according to legend, disguised herself as a man and was elected pope; some cards also show a child, and the Pope Joan legend pictured her as found out when she gave birth during a papal procession), as Mary, Mother of God, or even as Cybele, Isis, or Venus. Cards with a woman wearing a papal tiara, produced during the Protestant Reformation, and apparent images of &quot;Pope Joan&quot; and her child, have been seen as a Protestant attempt to ridicule the office of the papacy and the Roman Catholic faith. However, the papal tiara disappeared from later depictions of the &quot;Popess&quot; and showed her wearing more standard medieval female headgear.

All tarot cards also contain a representation of the pope, known as &quot;The Hierophant&quot;, in some cases crowned with a papal tiara. For instance, the Rider–Waite tarot deck, currently the widest-circulated deck in existence, depicts &quot;The Hierophant&quot; or pope as wearing a papal tiara and carrying a papal cross.

<doc id="184685" wikidata="Q501327" url="?curid=184685" title="Jesus Freak (album)">
<text>Jesus Freak is the fourth studio album by the American Christian rap and rock trio DC Talk, released on November 21, 1995, on ForeFront Records. The style was a marked departure from the group&#x27;s previous releases, incorporating a heavier rock sound and elements of grunge that was popular at the time.

The album was released to both critical and commercial success. It peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and six of the album&#x27;s seven singles reached number one across various Christian radio formats. It won the 1997 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album.

&quot;Jesus Freak&quot; is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential albums in the history of contemporary Christian music (CCM).

==Background==
After three albums of hip-hop oriented sound, including DC Talk&#x27;s Grammy award-winning third album, &quot;Free at Last&quot;, which was based primarily on hip-hop- and pop-oriented songwriting, the trio decided to innovate and reinvent their style.

After three years, DC Talk returned with songs featuring a more alternative rock sound. Thus, the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Jesus Freak&quot;, was considered unexpected by fans and critics alike.

Michael Tait said, &quot;I was totally into rock and roll at the time [...] I really wanted to make a rock record.&quot; The band decided to focus on more rock-oriented music, with touches of rap and pop interwoven into the mix. Tait later explained, &quot;We wanted to write songs that would hopefully touch a generation.&quot;

==Recording and production==
Compared to DC Talk&#x27;s other albums, &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; was, stylistically, an experiment. The album was a fusion of various musical genres, including pop, rock, and grunge, all combined with hip hop.

The title track, &quot;Jesus Freak,&quot; is also of historical importance. It is believed to be the first link between grunge and rapcore in CCM. The song was even played on some secular stations.

In addition, the album contains two cover songs: &quot;Day by Day,&quot; from the musical &quot;Godspell&quot;, and a heavily overhauled version of &quot;In the Light&quot; originally by Charlie Peacock. Two spoken-word samples are also heard; &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; features the words of Billy Graham and &quot;What If I Stumble&quot; contains a quote from Brennan Manning.

==Lyrical themes==
As with the genres, the themes of &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; are varied, ranging from the spiritual–such as accepting Jesus, hypocrisy, atheism–to the social, such as seeking forgiveness from a friend, racism, facing intolerance, and acceptance.

==Release==
&quot;Jesus Freak&quot; was released on November 21, 1995. It debuted at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling over 85,800 copies in its first week of release. This number was the highest debut for a Christian album at the time.

After the album, released through ForeFront Records, proved to be extremely successful, the band signed an exclusive distribution deal with Virgin Records. The label made it a priority to promote the album to mainstream music fans. Due to this promotional increase, &quot;Between You and Me&quot; became a hit for the band, managing to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Reception==

After the initial success of its release, &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; was RIAA-certified as Gold by its first month, for shipments exceeding 500,000 units. The album has gone on to sell over two million copies in the United States, achieving double platinum certification by the RIAA. Critical response to &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; was generally positive, and many of the album&#x27;s singles were met with positive reception. For instance, &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; was the first non-AC song to win the Dove Award for Song of the Year. The album also spawned several hit singles. Six of the album&#x27;s singles became number-one hits across various Christian radio formats. &quot;Between You and Me&quot; was even a cross-over hit on secular radio, peaking at number 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Legacy==

The album is considered one of the greatest and most influential Christian albums of all time and is viewed as a landmark of the 1990s alternative rock scene.

It is one of the biggest-selling Christian albums of all time and has been certified double platinum in the United States and gold in Canada.

On June 20, 2006, Gotee Records released a ten-year anniversary tribute, &quot;Freaked!&quot;, featuring artists from record labels Gotee and Mono vs Stereo covering songs from the original album. &quot;In the Light&quot; and &quot;Jesus Freak&quot; are both featured in &quot;Alive and Transported&quot;. In addition, the songs are still regularly sung in tobyMac and Newsboys concerts.

In 2006, EMI released a commemorative 10th-anniversary version of the album, &quot;Jesus Freak: 10th Anniversary Special Edition&quot;. This special edition contained a bonus disc of brand-new remixes, rarities, live tracks, and demos. A single-disc remaster was released in 2013.

For the 20th anniversary of the album in November 2015, SMLXLVinyl.com released a double lp 180-gram vinyl of the album. It was its first pressing on the format.

<text>Long John Silver is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the 1883 novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson. The most colourful and complex character in the book, he continues to appear in popular culture. His missing leg and parrot, in particular, have greatly contributed to the image of the pirate in popular culture.

==Profile==
Long John Silver is a cunning and opportunistic pirate who was quartermaster under the notorious Captain Flint. Stevenson&#x27;s portrayal of Silver has greatly influenced the modern iconography of the pirate.

Long John Silver has a parrot, named Captain Flint in honor—or mockery—of his former captain, who generally perches on Silver&#x27;s shoulder, and is known to chatter pirate or seafaring phrases like &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;, and &quot;Stand by to go about&quot;. Silver uses the parrot as another means of gaining Jim&#x27;s trust, by telling the boy all manner of exciting stories about the parrot&#x27;s buccaneer history. &#x27;Now that bird&#x27;, Silver would say, &#x27;is, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins—they lives forever mostly, and if anybody&#x27;s seen more wickedness it must be the devil himself. She&#x27;s sailed with England—the great pirate Cap&#x27;n England. She&#x27;s been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello... She was at the boarding of the &quot;Viceroy of the Indies&quot; out of Goa, she was, and to look at her you would think she was a baby&#x27;.

Silver claims to have served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under &quot;the immortal Hawke&quot;. &quot;His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder, he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham—plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling.&quot;

He claims to have been the only man whom Flint ever feared. Although treacherous and willing to change sides at any time to further his own interests, Silver has compensating virtues. He is wise enough to save his money, in contrast to the spendthrift ways of most of the pirates. He is physically courageous despite his disability: for instance, when Flint&#x27;s cache is found to be empty, he coolly stands his ground against five murderous seamen despite having only Jim, a boy in his teens, to back him.

When Silver escapes at the end of the novel, he takes &quot;three or four hundred guineas&quot; of the treasure with him, thus becoming one of only two former members of Captain Flint&#x27;s crew to get his hands on a portion of the recovered treasure. (The repentant maroonee Ben Gunn is the other, but he spends all £1,000 in nineteen days.) Jim&#x27;s own ambivalence towards Silver is reflected in the last chapter, when he speculates that the old pirate must have settled down in comfortable retirement: &quot;It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another world are very small.&quot;

Silver is married to a woman of African descent, whom he trusts to manage his business affairs in his absence and to liquidate his Bristol assets when his actions make it impossible for him to go home. He confides in his fellow pirates that he and his wife plan to rendezvous after the voyage to Skeleton Island is complete and Flint&#x27;s treasure is recovered, at which point Silver will retire to a life of luxury. Ironically his &quot;share&quot; of Flint&#x27;s treasure (£420) is considerably less than that of Ben Gunn (£1,000) and what Silver boasts was his share from England (£900) and from Flint (£2,000).

According to Stevenson&#x27;s letters, the idea for the character of Long John Silver was in part inspired by his real-life friend William Henley, a writer and editor. Stevenson&#x27;s stepson, Lloyd Osbourne, described Henley as &quot;...a great, glowing, massive-shouldered fellow with a big red beard and a crutch; jovial, astoundingly clever, and with a laugh that rolled like music; he had an unimaginable fire and vitality; he swept one off one&#x27;s feet&quot;. In a letter to Henley after the publication of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, Stevenson wrote: &quot;I will now make a confession. It was the sight of your maimed strength and masterfulness that begot Long John Silver...the idea of the maimed man, ruling and dreaded by the sound, was entirely taken from you&quot;.

<doc id="184695" wikidata="Q327541" url="?curid=184695" title="Arson">
<text>Arson is the act of willfully and deliberately setting fire to or charring property. Although the act of arson typically involves buildings, the term can also refer to the intentional burning of other things, such as motor vehicles, watercraft, or forests. The crime is typically classified as a felony, with instances involving risk to human life or property carrying a stricter penalty. Arson that results in death can be further prosecuted as manslaughter or murder. A common motive for arson is to commit insurance fraud. In such cases, a person destroys their own property by burning it and then lies about the cause in order to collect against their insurance policy. Arson is also often committed to conceal another crime, such as murder or burglary.

A person who commits arson is referred to as an arsonist, or a serial arsonist if the person has committed arson several times. Arsonists normally use an accelerant (such as gasoline or kerosene) to ignite, propel, and direct fires, and the detection and identification of ignitable liquid residues is an important part of fire investigations. Pyromania is an impulse control disorder characterized by the pathological setting of fires. Most acts of arson are not committed by pyromaniacs.
==Etymology==
The term derives from Law French &quot;arsoun&quot; (late 13th century), from Old French , from Late Latin &quot;a burning,&quot; (acc.) from the verb , &quot;to burn.&quot;

The Old English term was , lit. &quot;burning&quot;; and Edward Coke has indictment of &quot;burning&quot; (1640). &quot;Arsonist&quot; is from 1864.

==English common law==
English Common Law defines arson as &quot;the malicious burning of the dwelling of another.&quot;

This definition has four elements:

;Malicious: For purposes of common law arson, &quot;malicious&quot; refers to intention of starting the fire. Fires can be started on purpose or by accident. In either case, there is legal precedent charge the guilty person with arson whether their intention was to start a fire or not. &quot;Malicious&quot; in this case is describing the intention of the arsonist as ill-intentioned and intending to cause harm or death.
;Burning: According to common law charring to any part of dwelling was sufficient to satisfy this element. No significant amount of damage to the dwelling was required. Any injury or damage to the structure caused by exposure to heat or flame is sufficient.
;Of the dwelling: &#x27;Dwelling&#x27; refers to a place of residence. The destruction of an unoccupied building was not considered arson: &quot;... since arson protected habitation, the burning of an unoccupied house did not constitute arson.&quot; At common law a structure did not become a residence until the first occupants had moved in, and ceased to be a dwelling if the occupants abandoned the premises with no intention of resuming their residency. Dwelling includes structures and outbuildings within the curtilage. Dwellings were not limited to houses. A barn could be the subject of arson if occupied as a dwelling.
;Of another: Burning one&#x27;s own dwelling does not constitute common law arson, even if the purpose was to collect insurance, because &quot;it was generally assumed in early England that one had the legal right to destroy his own property in any manner he chose&quot;. Moreover, for purposes of common law arson, possession or occupancy rather than title determines whose dwelling the structure is. Thus a tenant who sets fire to his rented house would not be guilty of common law arson, while the landlord who set fire to a rented dwelling house would be guilty.

==Degrees==
Many U.S. state legal systems and the legal systems of several other countries divide arson into degrees, depending sometimes on the value of the property but more commonly on its use and whether the crime was committed in the day or night.
*First-degree arson – Burning an occupied structure such as a school or a place where people are normally present
*Second-degree arson – Burning an unoccupied building such as an empty barn or an unoccupied house or other structure in order to claim insurance on such property
*Third-degree arson – Burning an abandoned building or an abandoned area, such as a field, forest or woods.

Many statutes vary the degree of the crime according to the criminal intent of the accused. Some US states use other degrees of arson, such as &quot;fourth&quot; and &quot;fifth&quot; degree, while some states do not categorize arson by any degree. For example, in the state of Tennessee, arson is categorized as &quot;arson&quot; and &quot;aggravated arson.&quot;

== Insurance fraud ==
A common motive for arson is to commit insurance fraud. In such cases, a person destroys their own property by burning it and then lies about the cause in order to collect against their insurance policy.

An example of insurance fraud being the motivating factor for an act of arson is the case for Operation Firebird. A married couple and four co-conspirators were arrested and convicted with arson and insurance fraud after a string of home, business, and warehouse fires which took place between 2014 and 2018 were exposed as acts of arson. Using chicken left in boiling frying oil, the convicted criminals would make fire seem like a cooking accident. Then, the group committed insurance fraud by filing insurance claims for the cost of the building, as well as, smoke-damaged goods to claim fire damages for insurance payouts. The group&#x27;s scheme claimed a reported $4 million and ended when authorities were tipped off as to where the location of the next planned incident would take place. Police then performed an investigation dubbed Operation Firebird with the San Jose Fire Department. According to a 2019 Press Release from the California Department of Insurance, Tyler and Kim Chen, Ha Nguyen, Sandy Ngo, Duyen Pham, and Trang Huynh were all convicted with various degrees of arson and insurance fraud.

Tyler Chen was convicted with five separate counts of arson and two separate counts of insurance fraud in Santa Clara County in 2018. Tyler Chen&#x27;s wife, Kim Chen, was convicted with two counts of insurance fraud in Santa Clara county.

== By region ==

===United States===
In the United States, the common law elements of arson are often varied in different jurisdictions. For example, the element of &quot;dwelling&quot; is no longer required in most states, and arson occurs by the burning of any real property without consent or with unlawful intent. Arson is prosecuted with attention to degree of severity in the alleged offense. First degree arson generally occurs when people are harmed or killed in the course of the fire, while second degree arson occurs when significant destruction of property occurs. While usually a felony, arson may also be prosecuted as a misdemeanor, &quot;criminal mischief&quot;, or &quot;destruction of property.&quot; Burglary also occurs, if the arson involved a &quot;breaking and entering&quot;. A person may be sentenced to death if arson occurred as a method of homicide, as was the case in California of Raymond Lee Oyler and in Texas of Cameron Todd Willingham.

After the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, the United States started a National Fire Prevention Week in order to educate the people on ways to prevent fires, minimize their damages, and hopefully drastically decrease casualties. Fire Prevention Week campaigns includes various information on safe cooking practices pertaining to grilling, microwaving, and cooking on a stove.

During World War II arson was a much higher concern in the United States. There was a severe lack of firefighters due to the fact most of the men were overseas to fight the war. There were few men left behind to help combat forest fires. For example, during WW II in Eldora, Iowa a fire chief reported that his regular membership shrank from 21 to 9 men and their fire fighting force recruited retired members and new members to fill the missing positions during the war. Although there were few attempts to burn U.S. forests, it continued to be a big concern due to the potential detrimental effects. This concern for arson attempts led to the rise of Smokey Bear who was the face of fire prevention and fire safety measures. Although the intention of Smokey Bear&#x27;s persona is to encourage fire safety, Smokey shares a message of fire prevention which includes accidental fires that can sometimes be legally charged as arson.

In New York, arson is charged in five degrees. Arson in the first degree is a Class A-1 felony and requires the intent to burn the building with a person inside using an explosive incendiary device. In New York, the criminal charge of arson includes a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.

In California, a conviction for arson of property that is not one&#x27;s own is a felony punishable by up to three years in state prison. Aggravated arson, which carries the most severe punishment for arson, is punishable by 10 years to life in state prison. A well-known example of arson which took place in California is the Esperanza Fire. Raymond Lee Oyler was ultimately convicted of murder and sentenced to death for a 2006 fire in southern California that led to the deaths of five U.S. Forest Service firefighters; he was the first U.S. citizen to receive such a conviction and penalty for wildfire arson.

Some states, such as California, prosecute the lesser offense of &quot;reckless burning&quot; when the fire is set recklessly as opposed to willfully and maliciously. The study of the causes is the subject of fire investigation. A recent example of a reckless burning offense is the El Dorado fire which took place in 2020 in California. This fire was caused by a gender reveal party which utilized a smoke bomb which is categorized as unsafe pyrotechnics. The El Dorado fire burned over a 71-day period, destroyed 20 structures and resulted in one firefighter fatality, for which the couple hosting the party were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The Esperanza Fire ultimately resulted in the death of firefighter Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Morton, who became trapped while attempting to fight the fire. The DA of California considered arson charges for the family members as they were deemed negligent with regard to fire safety.

=== England ===
In English law, arson was a common law offence (except for the offence of arson in royal dockyards) dealing with the criminal destruction of buildings by fire. The common law offence was abolished by s.11(1) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. The 1971 Act makes no distinction as to mode of destruction except that s.1(3) requires that if the destruction is by fire, the offence is charged as arson; s.4 of the Act provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for conviction under s.1 whether or not the offence is charged as arson. In Hong Kong, the common law offence was abolished by s 67 of the Crimes Ordinance 1971 (Part VIII of which, as amended by Crimes (Amendment) Ordinance 1972, mirrored the English Criminal Damage Act 1971). Like the English counterparts, 63 of the 1972 Ordinance provides a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and s 60(3) of the Ordinance requires that if the damage is by fire the offence should be charged as arson.

=== Myanmar ===
In the Burmese legal system, arson is considered &quot;mischief by fire&quot; under sections 435 and 436 of the Myanmar Penal Code and punishable by fine and imprisonment. The statutes were last amended on 1 July 2016, and made arson on houses and buildings punishable with up to 20 years in prison.

The Burmese military has long used arson as a weapon of war against civilians. From the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état to August 2022, military forces committed arson on 28,434 houses in the country.

===Scotland===

While the Scottish legal system has no offence known as arson statutorily defined, there are many offences that are used to charge those with acts that would normally constitute arson in other nations. Events constituting arson in English and Welsh law might be dealt with as one or more of a variety of offences such as wilful fire-raising, culpable and reckless conduct, vandalism or other offences depending on the circumstances of the event. The more serious offences (in particular wilful fire-raising and culpable and reckless conduct) can incur a sentence of life imprisonment.

=== Ireland ===
Ireland differentiates how it charges arson not by degree but rather by what is being destroyed and if anyone was harmed. For example, while the sentence for setting fire to a building can be life imprisonment, the sentence for setting fire to goods in a building can only be up to fourteen years.

A notable historical act of arson in Ireland is the burning of Wildgoose Lodge, which resulted in the arrest, sentencing, and execution of 18 men, many of whom were innocent. More recently, the 2023 Dublin riot involved instances of arson, with many such acts targeting vehicles.

==Notable arsonists==

* Herostratus, accused of setting fire to the Temple of Artemis in 356 BCE.
* Zayd ibn Musa al-Kazim, whose reign was characterized by a pogrom against the supporters of the Abbasids in 815 and 816, which earned him the nickname &quot;Zayd al-Nar&quot; (&#x27;Zayd of the Fire&#x27;) due to the large numbers of houses belonging to Abbasid family members or their followers that he torched.
* Murrough O&#x27;Brien, 1st Earl of Inchiquin, Irish nobleman and soldier, known as &quot;Murchadh na dTóiteán&quot; (&quot;Murrough the Burner&quot;) for his role in the Sack of Cashel and other similar atrocities during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.

<text>The Scott catalogue of postage stamps, published by Scott Publishing Company, now a subsidiary of Amos Media, is updated annually and lists all the stamps of the world that its editors recognize as issued for postal purposes. It is published in fourteen large volumes (as of 2021) that include twelve volumes containing all the countries of the world that have ever issued postage stamps, the &quot;United States Specialized Catalog&quot;, and the &quot;1840–1940 Classic Specialized Catalogue&quot; (covering the world for the first 100 years that stamps were issued). The numbering system used by Scott to identify stamps is dominant among stamp collectors in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

== Background ==

The first Scott catalogue was a 21-page pamphlet with the title &quot;Descriptive Catalogue of American and Foreign Postage Stamps, Issued from 1840 to Date, Splendidly Illustrated with Colored Engravings and Containing the Current Value of each Variety&quot;. It was published in September 1868 by John Walter Scott, an early stamp dealer in New York, and purported to list all the stamps of the world, with prices for each. A notice inside does caution the reader that &quot;it is simply impossible for any one to always have every stamp&quot; in stock. The original catalog has been reprinted.

In subsequent years, the Scott company gave up dealing in stamps but continued to publish the catalog, gradually providing more detail as the hobby evolved and collectors became more sophisticated. In addition to the factual information about the stamps, the catalog includes price information based on market analysis and reported sales from the previous year. As of 2006, and despite annual changes to save space, the catalog was more than 5,000 pages.

The Scott numbering system assigns plain numbers for regular mail stamps, and uses capital letter prefixes for special-purpose types, such as &quot;B&quot; for semi-postals and &quot;C&quot; for airmail. The numbers are generally consecutive; there are gaps among older stamps, where some numbered types were later renumbered, and among newer stamps where Scott has left numbers unassigned in the anticipation of additional stamps in a series. If more stamps than expected appear, Scott will add a capital letter as suffix, or if the change is very recent, it will renumber stamps. Minor variations, such as shades or errors, get a lowercase letter; so the &quot;C3a&quot; above indicates a variation (error in this case) on what is listed as the third U.S. airmail stamp.

Because of its commercial importance the publishers of the Scott Catalogue claim copyright on their numbering systems, and grant only limited licenses for their use by others. The inconsistency with which Scott enforced these licenses resulted in a lawsuit by Scott against Krause Publications (publishers of the Minkus Catalogue) for copyright infringement. After Krause filed a defense, the suit was settled out of court, and Krause continued to reference the Scott numbers.

Editors of this, the dominant catalog in the United States, have great influence over what is and is not considered to be a valid postage stamp. For instance, in the 1960s the countries of the United Arab Emirates issued many stamps that were likely never actually on sale in a post office, so Scott does not list most of them. One must go to a Michel catalog, for instance, to see them described. The lack of a Scott listing, though, means that most American dealers will refuse to trade in such stamps.

Similarly, Scott lists most stamps from countries embargoed by the U.S. government, and in some cases lists them without catalog values. To some extent, this is unavoidable, since the ban on importation means that Scott&#x27;s editors are unable even to acquire copies of the stamps to be described. Moreover, since American dealers and collectors are unable to buy the stamps legally, they are unlikely to have any need of the data. (Again, interested persons typically use Michel or other catalogs instead.) The policy changes with government policy; stamps of Cuba, Libya and North Vietnam now appear in the Scott catalogues after an absence of some years.

The dominance of Scott is such that U.S. collectors know many of the numbers by heart, and dealers need only mention the number in their price lists. For instance, United States no. &quot;C3a&quot; is instantly recognized as the Inverted Jenny, a rare airmail inverted error stamp.

== Contents ==

The contents for each of the twelve volumes (2021 catalogs) are listed below. Scott has chosen to identify the current twelve volume format of catalogs as only six volumes with an alphabetical suffix (vol 1b is actually vol 2, etc.).
* Volume 1a: United States, United Nations, &#x27;A&#x27; countries to Australia
* Volume 1b: Austria to &#x27;B&#x27; countries
* Volume 2a: &#x27;C&#x27; countries to Curaçao
* Volume 2b: Cyprus to &quot;F&quot; countries
* Volume 3a: &#x27;G&#x27; countries
* Volume 3b: &#x27;H&#x27; through &#x27;I&#x27; countries
* Volume 4a: &#x27;J&#x27; through &#x27;L&#x27; countries
* Volume 4b: &#x27;M&#x27; countries
* Volume 5a: &#x27;N&#x27; countries through &#x27;P&#x27; countries (Philippines)
* Volume 5b: &#x27;P&#x27; countries (Pitcairn Islands) to &#x27;S&#x27; countries (Samoa)
* Volume 6a: &#x27;S&#x27; countries (San Marino) to &#x27;T&#x27; countries (Tete)
* Volume 6b: &#x27;T&#x27; countries (Thailand) to &#x27;Z&#x27; countries

== Illustrations ==
In May, 2001 Scott announced a project to include a scan of each stamp in its catalogues. Many were made from its own reference collection and introduced in the six volume 2002 edition as black and white images. Color images were introduced in 2003 in the &quot;Classic Specialized Catalogue&quot; and in 2005 in the &quot;Specialized Catalogue of United States&quot;. In 2006 color images were included in the main Scott catalogues. Shortly after the program was announced, Scott Publishing received a letter from Hsien-ming Meng, a physician in Dayton, Ohio, and worldwide collector of mint stamps with a nearly complete collection. Dr. Meng offered to permit scanning of his collection, an offer that was eagerly accepted by Scott Publishing. Scans from Dr. Meng&#x27;s collection began appearing in volume 4 of the 2002 catalog. Together with generous access by many other collectors, Meng&#x27;s cooperation has resulted in creation of scanned images of all but about 1300 stamps by Scott as of 2024 catalogue series. About 120 are specialized stamps from the US Specialized Catalogue. About 1180 are used stamp images that Scott is replacing with mint images in the general world catalogues or are poorly centered stamps that they are replacing with F to VF centered stamps. Only a handful of black and white images are left in the world catalogues. Meng, born in 1926, died February 8, 2011.

== &quot;Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers&quot; ==
Scott Publishing Co also produces a related volume which more comprehensively lists all United States Postage Stamps and Postal History. It is generally known as the &quot;Scott Specialized&quot; and is regarded by many as the definitive single volume reference to USA postage stamps. The catalogue provides more detail than Volume One, with particular emphasis on varieties and errors. A new edition of the catalogue is produced annually with a particular edition year date generally indicating production in the middle of the previous year. Biannual Valuing Supplements are also issued in the Spring and Fall.

== &quot;Scott Classic Specialized Catalogue: Stamps and Covers of the World&quot; ==

&quot;Scott Classic Specialized Catalogue: Stamps and Covers of the World&quot; is limited to stamps and covers that were produced between 1840 and 1940 or for the British Commonwealth nations to 1952. It covers all postage stamp producing nations in one volume for those years.

<text>Vega 2 (along with Vega 1) was a Soviet space probe part of the Vega program to explore Halley&#x27;s comet and Venus. The spacecraft was a development of the earlier &quot;Venera&quot; craft. The name VeGa (ВеГа) combines the first two letters of the Russian words for Venus (Венера: &quot;Venera&quot;) and Halley (Галлея: &quot;Galleya&quot;). They were designed by Babakin Space Centre and constructed as [[5VK]] by Lavochkin at Khimki. The craft was powered by large twin solar panels. Instruments included an antenna dish, cameras, spectrometer, infrared sounder, magnetometers (MISCHA) and plasma probes. The craft was launched on top of a Proton-K from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Tyuratam, Kazakh SSR. Both Vega 1 and 2 were three-axis stabilized spacecraft. The spacecraft were equipped with a dual bumper shield for dust protection from Halley&#x27;s Comet.

== Venus mission ==
The descent module arrived at Venus on 15 June 1985, two days after being released from the Vega 2 flyby probe. The module, a , diameter sphere, contained a surface lander and a balloon explorer. The flyby probe performed a gravitational assist maneuver using Venus, and continued its mission to intercept the comet.

===Lander===
The surface lander was identical to that of Vega 1 as well as the previous six &quot;Venera&quot; missions. The objective of the probe was the study of the atmosphere and the exposed surface of the planet. The scientific payload included a UV spectrometer, temperature and pressure sensors, a water concentration meter, a gas-phase chromatograph, an X-ray spectrometer, a mass spectrometer, and a surface sampling device. Several of these scientific tools (the UV spectrometer, the mass spectrograph, and the devices to measure pressure and temperature) were developed in collaboration with French scientists. Since the probe made a nighttime landing, no images were taken.

The Vega 2 lander touched down at 03:00:50 UT on 15 June 1985 at around , in the northern region of Aphrodite Terra. The altitude of the touchdown site was above the planetary mean radius. The measured pressure at the landing site was 91 atm and the temperature was . The surface sample was found to be an anorthosite–troctolite rock, rarely found on Earth, but present in the lunar highlands, leading to the conclusion that the area was probably the oldest explored by any Venera vehicle. It transmitted data from the surface for 56 minutes.

===Balloon===
The Vega 2 Lander/Balloon capsule entered the Venusian atmosphere ( altitude) at 02:06:04 UT (Earth received time; Moscow time 05:06:04) on 15 June 1985 at roughly . At approximately 2:06:19 UT the parachute attached to the landing craft cap opened at an altitude of . The cap and parachute were released 15 seconds later at altitude. The balloon package was pulled out of its compartment by parachute 40 seconds later at altitude, at 7.45 degrees S, 179.8 degrees east. A second parachute opened at an altitude of , 200 seconds after entry, extracting the furled balloon.

The balloon was inflated 100 seconds later at and the parachute and inflation system were jettisoned. The ballast was jettisoned when the balloon reached roughly and the balloon floated back to a stable height between some 15 to 25 minutes after entry. The mean stable height was , with a pressure of and a temperature of in the middle, most active layer of the Venus three-tiered cloud system. The balloon drifted westward in the zonal wind flow with an average speed of about at nearly constant latitude. The probe crossed the terminator from night to day at 9:10 UT on 16 June after traversing . The probe continued to operate in the daytime until the final transmission was received at 00:38 UT on 17 June from 7.5 S, 76.3 E after a total traverse distance of . It is not known how much further the balloon traveled after the final communication.

== Halley mission ==
After their encounters, the Vegas&#x27; motherships were redirected by Venus&#x27; gravity to intercept Halley&#x27;s Comet.

The spacecraft initiated its encounter on March 7, 1986, by taking 100 photos of the comet from a distance of .

Vega 2 made its closest approach at 07:20 UT on March 9, 1986, at . The data intensive examination of the comet covered only the three hours around closest approach. They were intended to measure the physical parameters of the nucleus, such as dimensions, shape, temperature and surface properties, as well as to study the structure and dynamics of the coma, the gas composition close to the nucleus, the dust particles&#x27; composition and mass distribution as functions of distance to the nucleus and the cometary-solar wind interaction.

During the encounter, Vega 2 took 700 images of the comet, with better resolution than those from the twin Vega 1, partly due to the presence of less dust outside the coma at the time. Yet Vega 2 recorded an 80% power loss during the encounter as compared to Vega 1&#x27;s 40%.

After further imaging sessions on 10 and 11 March 1986, Vega 2 finished its primary mission.

== Post Halley==

A 6 million kilometer distant flyby of 2101 Adonis was considered, however, Vega 2 didn&#x27;t have enough fuel left to make the necessary orbital changes for the flyby. Instead the Vega probes took the opportunity to measure the dust as they passed through the orbits of 72P/Denning–Fujikawa, Biela&#x27;s Comet and 289P/Blanpain.

Contact with Vega 2 was lost on 24 March 1987. Vega 1 had previously exhausted its attitude control propellant on 30 January 1987.

Vega 2 is currently in heliocentric orbit, with perihelion of 0.70 AU, aphelion of 0.98 AU, eccentricity of 0.17, inclination of 2.3 degrees and orbital period of 281 days.

<doc id="184725" wikidata="Q1541588" url="?curid=184725" title="Sacramento Monarchs">
<text>The Sacramento Monarchs were a professional basketball team based in Sacramento, California. They played in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) from 1997 until folding on November 20, 2009. They played their home games at ARCO Arena.

The Monarchs were one of the WNBA&#x27;s eight original franchises and were noted early on for standout players Ticha Penicheiro, Ruthie Bolton and Yolanda Griffith. They were the sister franchise of the Sacramento Kings National Basketball Association (NBA) team. They were one of the more successful WNBA franchises on the court, though they often trailed behind perennial Western Conference champions the Houston Comets and the Los Angeles Sparks. However, in 2005, the team brought Sacramento its first championship, winning the WNBA Finals for the only time.

==History==

===Origins (1997–2003)===
The Monarchs made an impact in the WNBA almost immediately. With the hiring of Portuguese national team player Ticha Penicheiro, popular player Ruthie Bolton and prolific scorer Yolanda Griffith, all of whom have been WNBA All-Stars, the Monarchs made the playoffs almost every year during this time, but were eliminated before reaching the WNBA Finals.

===Championship window (2004–2006)===
After losing to the Seattle Storm in the 2004 WNBA Western Conference Championship, the Monarchs made major roster moves to improve the team – obtaining younger players and emphasizing Head Coach John Whisenant&#x27;s defense-oriented system. Bolton, one of the team&#x27;s original players, became a free agent and the Monarchs made the difficult decision not to keep her on the active playing roster, though they did offer her a position in their front office. Edna Campbell, a breast cancer survivor and another fan favorite, was not signed by the Monarchs and later signed with the San Antonio Silver Stars.

On March 3, 2005, the Monarchs traded Tangela Smith and a 2006 second round draft pick to the Charlotte Sting in exchange for former Stanford University standout Nicole Powell, Olympia Scott-Richardson, and Erin Buescher. After signing two Chinese players, Miao Lijie and Sui Feifei, the Monarchs traded Chantelle Anderson to the San Antonio Silver Stars for a 2006 draft pick. During the 2005 WNBA draft, the Monarchs drafted point guard Kristin Haynie from Michigan State University and Chelsea Newton from Rutgers University. The Monarchs did sign Ruthie Bolton as a free agent for the purpose of her trying to win a spot on team&#x27;s roster during its pre-season training camp, but eventually waived her. Bolton later joined the Monarchs to work in their promotions and public relations department.
The offseason moves immediately paid off for the Monarchs as the team finished with a franchise-best 25–9 win–loss record. Whisenant was later named the WNBA Coach of the Year, and Powell received the WNBA Most Improved Player Award. After previous seasons of being eliminated from the WNBA Playoffs by either the Houston Comets or the Los Angeles Sparks, the Monarchs finally defeated both, sweeping both teams en route to their first appearance in the WNBA Finals. The Monarchs won their first ever WNBA Finals by defeating the Connecticut Sun, three games to one in a best-of-five playoff series, which brought the city of Sacramento its second major championship in a professional sport. After winning the championship, the Monarchs became the first women&#x27;s professional team to appear on a Wheaties box.

The Monarchs remained strong in 2006, finishing second place in the West. The Monarchs would catch fire in the playoffs, once again sweeping both Houston and then top seeded LA to reach the Finals for the second straight season. But in the Finals, they were defeated by the Detroit Shock 3 games to 2, in the first WNBA Finals to go 5 games.

===Decline (2007–2009)===
In 2007, the Monarchs finished strongly again, but blew a chance to get the #2 seed at the end of the season. They were matched up against the San Antonio Silver Stars. After defeating the Silver Stars in game 1 at home, the Monarchs would lose games 2 &amp; 3 (and the series) in San Antonio, ending their two-year run as Western Conference champions.

In 2008 the Monarchs were markedly less strong, but hung around the Western Playoff picture all season and finished with the #4 seed. Facing the Silver Stars again in the first round, the Monarchs were hoping for some payback for 2007. The series did not start well for the Monarchs, as they dropped Game 1 at home 85–78. Now the series shifted to San Antonio, and it seemed the series would come to a quick end. But the Monarchs would not back down, blowing out the Silver Stars in Game 2 84–67, forcing the critical Game 3. In Game 3, the Stars came out strong and at one point had a 14-point lead. But the Monarchs put together a furious rally, scoring seven points in the final 90 seconds of play to even the game and force it to overtime. But unfortunately for the Monarchs, the Silver Stars came out strong in the extra period and won the game, 86–81, ending the Monarchs&#x27; season.

In 2009, the Monarchs had one of their worst seasons in franchise history. It also led to the firing of head coach Jenny Boucek during the season, after which she was replaced by John Whisenant, the coach that led the Monarchs to their first championship in 2005. They finished 12–22, last in the conference and the league. They also missed the playoffs for the first time since the 2002 season and tied the record for the most losses with 22, the same number of losses they made 11 years ago.

===Dissolution===
It was revealed on November 20, 2009, that the Maloof family would no longer operate the Monarchs. The league attempted to re-locate the Monarchs to the San Francisco Bay Area, but on December 8, 2009, it was announced that new ownership could not be found and a dispersal draft would be held on December 14, 2009. As of 2024, the Monarchs were the last WNBA team to cease operations.

===Possibility of rebirth===
In October 2009, there were plans to relocate the Monarchs to Oakland but they never came to fruition. The ownership group of the Sacramento Kings, led by Vivek Ranadivé, have indicated a desire to bring back the Monarchs as shared tenants for the new Golden 1 Center an intention shared with former Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson, himself a former professional basketball player in the NBA.

<text>Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species (mass transfer in the form of advection), either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously in the same system.

Heat conduction, also called diffusion, is the direct microscopic exchanges of kinetic energy of particles (such as molecules) or quasiparticles (such as lattice waves) through the boundary between two systems. When an object is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings, heat flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, at which point they are in thermal equilibrium. Such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature, as described in the second law of thermodynamics.

Heat convection occurs when the bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries its heat through the fluid. All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called &quot;natural convection&quot;. The former process is often called &quot;forced convection.&quot; In this case, the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan, or other mechanical means.

Thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or fluid or gas). It is the transfer of energy by means of photons or electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws.

== Overview ==
Heat transfer is the energy exchanged between materials (solid/liquid/gas) as a result of a temperature difference. The thermodynamic free energy is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. Enthalpy is a thermodynamic potential, designated by the letter &quot;H&quot;, that is the sum of the internal energy of the system (U) plus the product of pressure (P) and volume (V). Joule is a unit to quantify energy, work, or the amount of heat.

Heat transfer is a process function (or path function), as opposed to functions of state; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process that changes the state of a system depends on how that process occurs, not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.

Thermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient, the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat. Heat flux is a quantitative, vectorial representation of heat flow through a surface.

In engineering contexts, the term &quot;heat&quot; is taken as synonymous with thermal energy. This usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid (&quot;caloric&quot;) that can be transferred by various causes, and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life.

The transport equations for thermal energy (Fourier&#x27;s law), mechanical momentum (Newton&#x27;s law for fluids), and mass transfer (Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion) are similar, and analogies among these three transport processes have been developed to facilitate the prediction of conversion from any one to the others.

Thermal engineering concerns the generation, use, conversion, storage, and exchange of heat transfer. As such, heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes.

==Mechanisms==

The fundamental modes of heat transfer are:

;Advection
: Advection is the transport mechanism of a fluid from one location to another, and is dependent on motion and momentum of that fluid.
;Conduction or diffusion
: The transfer of energy between objects that are in physical contact. Thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat and is evaluated primarily in terms of Fourier&#x27;s law for heat conduction.
;Convection
: The transfer of energy between an object and its environment, due to fluid motion. The average temperature is a reference for evaluating properties related to convective heat transfer.
;Radiation
: The transfer of energy by the emission of electromagnetic radiation.

===Advection===
By transferring matter, energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another. This can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is thermal hydraulics. This can be described by the formula:
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is heat flux (W/m2),
* formula_3 is density (kg/m3),
* formula_4 is heat capacity at constant pressure (J/kg·K),
* formula_5 is the difference in temperature (K),
* formula_6 is velocity (m/s).

===Conduction===

On a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact. Fluids—especially gases—are less conductive. Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact. The process of heat transfer from one place to another place without the movement of particles is called conduction, such as when placing a hand on a cold glass of water—heat is conducted from the warm skin to the cold glass, but if the hand is held a few inches from the glass, little conduction would occur since air is a poor conductor of heat. Steady-state conduction is an idealized model of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant so that after a time, the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further (see Fourier&#x27;s law). In steady state conduction, the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out, since the temperature change (a measure of heat energy) is zero. An example of steady state conduction is the heat flow through walls of a warm house on a cold day—inside the house is maintained at a high temperature and, outside, the temperature stays low, so the transfer of heat per unit time stays near a constant rate determined by the insulation in the wall and the spatial distribution of temperature in the walls will be approximately constant over time.

&quot;Transient conduction&quot; (see Heat equation) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time. Analysis of transient systems is more complex, and analytic solutions of the heat equation are only valid for idealized model systems. Practical applications are generally investigated using numerical methods, approximation techniques, or empirical study.

===Convection===

The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called &quot;natural convection&quot;. All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case, the fluid is forced to flow by using a pump, fan, or other mechanical means.

Convective heat transfer, or simply, convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids, a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer. The bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations, such as between a solid surface and the fluid. Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming. The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.

Free, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid. &quot;Forced&quot; convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external means—such as fans, stirrers, and pumps—creating an artificially induced convection current.

====Convection-cooling====

Convective cooling is sometimes described as Newton&#x27;s law of cooling:
 However, by definition, the validity of Newton&#x27;s law of cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of (&quot;proportional to&quot;) the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In these cases, Newton&#x27;s law does not apply.

===Convection vs. conduction===
In a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction, and convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy, while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.

The Rayleigh number (formula_7) is the product of the Grashof (formula_8) and Prandtl (formula_9) numbers. It is a measure that determines the relative strength of conduction and convection.

formula_10
where
* &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity,
* &quot;ρ&quot; is the density with formula_11 being the density difference between the lower and upper ends,
* &quot;μ&quot; is the dynamic viscosity,
* &quot;α&quot; is the Thermal diffusivity,
* &quot;β&quot; is the volume thermal expansivity (sometimes denoted &quot;α&quot; elsewhere),
* &quot;T&quot; is the temperature,
* &quot;ν&quot; is the kinematic viscosity, and
* &quot;L&quot; is characteristic length.

The Rayleigh number can be understood as the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by convection to the rate of heat transfer by conduction; or, equivalently, the ratio between the corresponding timescales (i.e. conduction timescale divided by convection timescale), up to a numerical factor. This can be seen as follows, where all calculations are up to numerical factors depending on the geometry of the system.

The buoyancy force driving the convection is roughly formula_12, so the corresponding pressure is roughly formula_13. In steady state, this is canceled by the shear stress due to viscosity, and therefore roughly equals formula_14, where &quot;V&quot; is the typical fluid velocity due to convection and formula_15 the order of its timescale. The conduction timescale, on the other hand, is of the order of formula_16.

Convection occurs when the Rayleigh number is above 1,000–2,000.

===Radiation===

Radiative heat transfer is the transfer of energy via thermal radiation, i.e., electromagnetic waves. It occurs across vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or fluid or gas). Thermal radiation is emitted by all objects at temperatures above absolute zero, due to random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles (protons and electrons), their movement results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation which carries away energy. Radiation is typically only important in engineering applications for very hot objects, or for objects with a large temperature difference.

When the objects and distances separating them are large in size and compared to the wavelength of thermal radiation, the rate of transfer of radiant energy is best described by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. For an object in vacuum, the equation is:
formula_17

For radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:
formula_18
where
* formula_2 is the heat flux,
* formula_20 is the emissivity (unity for a black body),
* formula_21 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant,
* formula_22 is the view factor between two surfaces a and b, and
* formula_23 and formula_24 are the absolute temperatures (in kelvins or degrees Rankine) for the two objects.

The blackbody limit established by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation can be exceeded when the objects exchanging thermal radiation or the distances separating them are comparable in scale or smaller than the dominant thermal wavelength. The study of these cases is called near-field radiative heat transfer.

Radiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and power. Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal radiation – arriving within a narrow-angle i.e. coming from a source much smaller than its distance – can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in concentrating solar power generation or a burning glass. For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the PS10 solar power tower and during the day it can heat water to .

The reachable temperature at the target is limited by the temperature of the hot source of radiation. (T4-law lets the reverse flow of radiation back to the source rise.) The (on its surface) somewhat 4000 K hot sun allows to reach coarsely 3000 K (or 3000 °C, which is about 3273 K) at a small probe in the focus spot of a big concave, concentrating mirror of the Mont-Louis Solar Furnace in France.

==Phase transition==

Phase transition or phase change, takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer. Phase change examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water.
The Mason equation explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on evaporation and condensation.

Phase transitions involve the four fundamental states of matter:
* Solid – Deposition, freezing, and solid-to-solid transformation.
* Liquid – Condensation and melting / fusion.
* Gas – Boiling / evaporation, recombination/ deionization, and sublimation.
* Plasma – Ionization.

===Boiling===

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid and the liquid evaporates resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume.

In a closed system, &quot;saturation temperature&quot; and &quot;boiling point&quot; mean the same thing. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.

At standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is &quot;sub-cooled nucleate boiling&quot;, and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the departure from nucleate boiling, or DNB).

At similar standard atmospheric pressure and high temperatures, the hydrodynamically quieter regime of film boiling is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between the fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer (&quot;spontaneous nucleation&quot;). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the critical heat flux, or CHF).

The Leidenfrost Effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater&#x27;s surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of &quot;gas thermal barrier&quot;.

===Condensation===
Condensation occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid. During condensation, the latent heat of vaporization must be released. The amount of heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure.

There are several types of condensation:
* Homogeneous condensation, as during the formation of fog.
* Condensation in direct contact with subcooled liquid.
* Condensation on direct contact with a cooling wall of a heat exchanger: This is the most common mode used in industry: Dropwise condensation is difficult to sustain reliably; therefore, industrial equipment is normally designed to operate in filmwise condensation mode.

===Melting===

Melting is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal energy of a substance is increased, typically through heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the melting point, at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. Molten substances generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element sulfur, whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.

==Modeling approaches==
Heat transfer can be modeled in various ways.

===Heat equation===
The heat equation is an important partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or temperature variation) in a given region over time. In some cases, exact solutions of the equation are available; in other cases the equation must be solved numerically using computational methods such as DEM-based models for thermal/reacting particulate systems (as critically reviewed by Peng et al.).

===Lumped system analysis===
Lumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one first-order linear differential equation, in which case heating and cooling are described by a simple exponential solution, often referred to as Newton&#x27;s law of cooling.

System analysis by the lumped capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object. This is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction system—that within the object—to an equivalent steady-state system. That is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely uniform, although its value may change over time.

In this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object&#x27;s boundary, known as the &quot;Biot number&quot;, is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of &quot;spatially uniform temperature within the object&quot; can be used: it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.

===Climate models===
Climate models study the radiant heat transfer by using quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.

==Engineering==

Heat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems. Heat-transfer principles may be used to preserve, increase, or decrease temperature in a wide variety of circumstances. Heat transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines, such as automotive engineering, thermal management of electronic devices and systems, climate control, insulation, materials processing, chemical engineering and power station engineering.

===Insulation, radiance and resistance===
Thermal insulators are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of heat by limiting conduction, convection, or both. Thermal resistance is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.

Radiance, or spectral radiance, is a measure of the quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. Radiant barriers are materials that reflect radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa. Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.

The effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its reflectivity, which is the fraction of radiation reflected. A material with a high reflectivity (at a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity=1 - emissivity. An ideal radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100 percent of incoming radiation. Vacuum flasks, or Dewars, are silvered to approach this ideal. In the vacuum of space, satellites use multi-layer insulation, which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) Mylar to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.

===Devices===

A heat engine is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of thermal energy (heat) to mechanical energy to perform mechanical work.

A thermocouple is a temperature-measuring device and a widely used type of temperature sensor for measurement and control, and can also be used to convert heat into electric power.

A thermoelectric cooler is a solid-state electronic device that pumps (transfers) heat from one side of the device to the other when an electric current is passed through it. It is based on the Peltier effect.

A thermal diode or thermal rectifier is a device that causes heat to flow preferentially in one direction.

====Heat exchangers====
A heat exchanger is used for more efficient heat transfer or to dissipate heat. Heat exchangers are widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, space heating, power generation, and chemical processing. One common example of a heat exchanger is a car&#x27;s radiator, in which the hot coolant fluid is cooled by the flow of air over the radiator&#x27;s surface.

Common types of heat exchanger flows include parallel flow, counter flow, and cross flow. In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and in cross flow, the fluids move at right angles to each other. Common types of heat exchangers include shell and tube, double pipe, extruded finned pipe, spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate. Each type has certain advantages and disadvantages over other types.

A heat sink is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car. A heat pipe is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces.

==Applications==

===Architecture===
Efficient energy use is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required in heating or cooling. In architecture, condensation and air currents can cause cosmetic or structural damage. An energy audit can help to assess the implementation of recommended corrective procedures. For instance, insulation improvements, air sealing of structural leaks, or the addition of energy-efficient windows and doors.
* Smart meter is a device that records electric energy consumption in intervals.
* Thermal transmittance is the rate of transfer of heat through a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. It is expressed in watts per square meter per kelvin, or W/(m2K). Well-insulated parts of a building have a low thermal transmittance, whereas poorly-insulated parts of a building have a high thermal transmittance.
* Thermostat is a device to monitor and control temperature.

===Climate engineering===
Climate engineering consists of carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management. Since the amount of carbon dioxide determines the radiative balance of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce the radiative forcing. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less solar radiation to offset the effects of greenhouse gases.

An alternative method is passive daytime radiative cooling, which enhances terrestrial heat flow to outer space through the infrared window (8–13 μm). Rather than merely blocking solar radiation, this method increases outgoing longwave infrared (LWIR) thermal radiation heat transfer with the extremely cold temperature of outer space (~2.7 K) to lower ambient temperatures while requiring zero energy input.

===Greenhouse effect===

The greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases and clouds, and is re-radiated in all directions, resulting in a reduction in the amount of thermal radiation reaching space relative to what would reach space in the absence of absorbing materials. This reduction in outgoing radiation leads to a rise in the temperature of the surface and troposphere until the rate of outgoing radiation again equals the rate at which heat arrives from the Sun.

===Heat transfer in the human body===

The principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body. The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.

Heat transfer by convection is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air. The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37 °C. Heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels cold when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment. Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body. This thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.

To ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body. This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the thickness of the fluid, the velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and fluid thickness can all be related to the Reynolds Number, a dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.

Latent heat loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body. The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin. Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.

===Cooling techniques===

====Evaporative cooling====

Evaporative cooling happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a constant enthalpy. Latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures are the same, no net evaporation of water in the air occurs; thus, there is no cooling effect.

====Laser cooling====
In quantum physics, laser cooling is used to achieve temperatures of near absolute zero (−273.15 °C, −459.67 °F) of atomic and molecular samples to observe unique quantum effects that can only occur at this heat level.
* Doppler cooling is the most common method of laser cooling.
* Sympathetic cooling is a process in which particles of one type cool particles of another type. Typically, atomic ions that can be directly laser-cooled are used to cool nearby ions or atoms. This technique allows the cooling of ions and atoms that cannot be laser-cooled directly.

====Magnetic cooling====

Magnetic evaporative cooling is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the magnetocaloric effect.

====Radiative cooling====
Radiative cooling is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation. Outgoing energy is an important effect in the Earth&#x27;s energy budget. In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun. The thermosphere (top of atmosphere) cools to space primarily by infrared energy radiated by carbon dioxide () at 15 μm and by nitric oxide (NO) at 5.3 μm. Convective transport of heat and evaporative transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it in the atmosphere.

=== Thermal energy storage ===
Thermal energy storage includes technologies for collecting and storing energy for later use. It may be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above or below that of the ambient environment. Applications include space heating, domestic or process hot water systems, or generating electricity.

== History ==
=== Newton&#x27;s law of cooling ===
In 1701, Isaac Newton anonymously published an article in &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; noting (in modern terms) that the rate of temperature change of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures (, &quot;degrees of heat&quot;) between the body and its surroundings. The phrase &quot;temperature change&quot; was later replaced with &quot;heat loss&quot;, and the relationship was named Newton&#x27;s law of cooling. In general, the law is valid only if the temperature difference is small and the heat transfer mechanism remains the same.

==== Thermal conduction ====
In heat conduction, the law is valid only if the thermal conductivity of the warmer body is independent of temperature. The thermal conductivity of most materials is only weakly dependent on temperature, so in general the law holds true.

==== Thermal convection ====
In convective heat transfer, the law is valid for forced air or pumped fluid cooling, where the properties of the fluid do not vary strongly with temperature, but it is only approximately true for buoyancy-driven convection, where the velocity of the flow increases with temperature difference.

==== Thermal radiation ====
In the case of heat transfer by thermal radiation, Newton&#x27;s law of cooling holds only for very small temperature differences.

=== Thermal conductivity of different metals ===
In a 1780 letter to Benjamin Franklin, Dutch-born British scientist Jan Ingenhousz relates an experiment which enabled him to rank seven different metals according to their thermal conductivities:

=== Benjamin Thompson&#x27;s experiments on heat transfer ===
During the years 1784 – 1798, the British physicist Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) lived in Bavaria, reorganizing the Bavarian army for the Prince-elector Charles Theodore among other official and charitable duties. The Elector gave Thompson access to the facilities of the Electoral Academy of Sciences in Mannheim. During his years in Mannheim and later in Munich, Thompson made a large number of discoveries and inventions related to heat.

==== Conductivity experiments ====

===== &quot;New Experiments upon Heat&quot; =====
In 1785 Thompson performed a series of thermal conductivity experiments, which he describes in great detail in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; article &quot;New Experiments upon Heat&quot; from 1786. The fact that good electrical conductors are often also good heat conductors and vice versa must have been well known at the time, for Thompson mentions it in passing. He intended to measure the relative conductivities of mercury, water, moist air, &quot;common air&quot; (dry air at normal atmospheric pressure), dry air of various rarefication, and a &quot;Torricellian vacuum&quot;.
For these experiments, Thompson employed a thermometer inside a large, closed glass tube. Under the circumstances described, heat may—unbeknownst to Thompson—have been transferred more by radiation than by conduction. These were his results.

After the experiments, Thompson was surprised to observe that a vacuum was a significantly poorer heat conductor than air &quot;which of itself is reckoned among the worst&quot;, but only a very small difference between common air and rarefied air. He also noted the great difference between dry air and moist air, and the great benefit this affords.
====== Temperature vs. sensible heat ======
Thompson concluded with some comments on the important difference between temperature and sensible heat.
=== Coining of the term &quot;convection&quot; ===
In the 1830s, in &quot;The Bridgewater Treatises&quot;, the term &quot;convection&quot; is attested in a scientific sense. In treatise VIII by William Prout, in the book on chemistry, it says:This motion of heat takes place in three ways, which a common fire-place very well illustrates. If, for instance, we place a thermometer directly before a fire, it soon begins to rise, indicating an increase of temperature. In this case the heat has made its way through the space between the fire and the thermometer, by the process termed &quot;radiation&quot;. If we place a second thermometer in contact with any part of the grate, and away from the direct influence of the fire, we shall find that this thermometer also denotes an increase of temperature; but here the heat must have travelled through the metal of the grate, by what is termed &quot;conduction&quot;. Lastly, a third thermometer placed in the chimney, away from the direct influence of the fire, will also indicate a considerable increase of temperature; in this case a portion of the air, passing through and near the fire, has become heated, and has &quot;carried&quot; up the chimney the temperature acquired from the fire. There is at present no single term in our language employed to denote this third mode of the propagation of heat; but we venture to propose for that purpose, the term &quot;convection&quot;, [in footnote: [Latin] &quot;Convectio&quot;, a carrying or conveying] which not only expresses the leading fact, but also accords very well with the two other terms.Later, in the same treatise VIII, in the book on meteorology, the concept of convection is also applied to &quot;the process by which heat is communicated through water&quot;.

Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal–oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stunted growth in children, can be reduced through adequate sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, and trachoma, to name just a few.

A range of sanitation technologies and approaches exists. Some examples are community-led total sanitation, container-based sanitation, ecological sanitation, emergency sanitation, environmental sanitation, onsite sanitation and sustainable sanitation. A sanitation system includes the capture, storage, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta and wastewater. Reuse activities within the sanitation system may focus on the nutrients, water, energy or organic matter contained in excreta and wastewater. This is referred to as the &quot;sanitation value chain&quot; or &quot;sanitation economy&quot;. The people responsible for cleaning, maintaining, operating, or emptying a sanitation technology at any step of the sanitation chain are called &quot;sanitation workers&quot;.

Several sanitation &quot;levels&quot; are being used to compare sanitation service levels within countries or across countries. The sanitation ladder defined by the Joint Monitoring Programme in 2016 starts at open defecation and moves upwards using the terms &quot;unimproved&quot;, &quot;limited&quot;, &quot;basic&quot;, with the highest level being &quot;safely managed&quot;. This is particularly applicable to developing countries.

The Human right to water and sanitation was recognized by the United Nations General Assembly in 2010. Sanitation is a global development priority and the subject of Sustainable Development Goal 6. The estimate in 2017 by JMP states that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation. Lack of access to sanitation has an impact not only on public health but also on human dignity and personal safety.

== Definitions ==
There are some variations on the use of the term &quot;sanitation&quot; between countries and organizations. The World Health Organization defines the term &quot;sanitation&quot; as follows:
Sanitation includes all four of these technical and non-technical systems: Excreta management systems, wastewater management systems (included here are wastewater treatment plants), solid waste management systems as well as drainage systems for rainwater, also called stormwater drainage. However, many in the WASH sector only include excreta management in their definition of sanitation.

Another example of what is included in sanitation is found in the handbook by Sphere on &quot;Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Humanitarian Response&quot; which describes minimum standards in four &quot;key response sectors&quot; in humanitarian response situations. One of them is &quot;Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion&quot; (WASH) and it includes the following areas: Hygiene promotion, water supply, excreta management, vector control, solid waste management and WASH in disease outbreaks and healthcare settings.

Hygiene promotion is seen by many as an integral part of sanitation. The Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council defines sanitation as &quot;The collection, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta, domestic wastewater and solid waste, and associated hygiene promotion.&quot;

Despite the fact that sanitation includes wastewater treatment, the two terms are often used side by side as &quot;sanitation and wastewater management&quot;.

Another definition is in the DFID guidance manual on water supply and sanitation programmes from 1998:

Sanitation can include personal sanitation and public hygiene. Personal sanitation work can include handling menstrual waste, cleaning household toilets, and managing household garbage. Public sanitation work can involve garbage collection, transfer and treatment (municipal solid waste management), cleaning drains, streets, schools, trains, public spaces, community toilets and public toilets, sewers, operating sewage treatment plants, etc. Workers who provide these services for other people are called sanitation workers.

== Purposes ==

The overall purposes of sanitation are to provide a healthy living environment for everyone, to protect the natural resources (such as surface water, groundwater, soil), and to provide safety, security and dignity for people when they defecate or urinate.

The Human Right to Water and Sanitation was recognized by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2010. It has been recognized in international law through human rights treaties, declarations and other standards. It is derived from the human right to an adequate standard of living.

Effective sanitation systems provide barriers between excreta and humans in such a way as to break the disease transmission cycle (for example in the case of fecal-borne diseases). This aspect is visualised with the F-diagram where all major routes of fecal-oral disease transmission begin with the letter F: feces, fingers, flies, fields, fluids, food.

Sanitation infrastructure has to be adapted to several specific contexts including consumers&#x27; expectations and local resources available.

Sanitation technologies may involve centralized civil engineering structures like sewer systems, sewage treatment, surface runoff treatment and solid waste landfills. These structures are designed to treat wastewater and municipal solid waste. Sanitation technologies may also take the form of relatively simple onsite sanitation systems. This can in some cases consist of a simple pit latrine or other type of non-flush toilet for the excreta management part.

Providing sanitation to people requires attention to the entire system, not just focusing on technical aspects such as the toilet, fecal sludge management or the wastewater treatment plant. The &quot;sanitation chain&quot; involves the experience of the user, excreta and wastewater collection methods, transporting and treatment of waste, and reuse or disposal. All need to be thoroughly considered.

=== Economic impacts ===
The benefits to society of managing human excreta are considerable, for public health as well as for the environment. As a rough estimate: For every US$1 spent on sanitation, the return to society is US$5.50.

For developing countries, the economic costs of inadequate sanitation is a huge concern. For example, according to a World Bank study, economic losses due to inadequate sanitation to The Indian economy are equivalent to 6.4% of its GDP. Most of these are due to premature mortality, time lost in accessing, loss of productivity, additional costs for healthcare among others. Inadequate sanitation also leads to loss from potential tourism revenue. This study also found that impacts are disproportionately higher for the poor, women and children. Availability of toilet at home on the other hand, positively contributes to economic well-being of women as it leads to an increase in literacy and participation in labor force.

== Types and concepts (for excreta management) ==
The term sanitation is connected with various descriptors or adjectives to signify certain types of sanitation systems (which may deal only with human excreta management or with the entire sanitation system, i.e. also greywater, stormwater and solid waste management) – in alphabetical order:

===Basic sanitation===

In 2017, JMP defined a new term: &quot;basic sanitation service&quot;. This is defined as the use of improved sanitation facilities that are not shared with other households. A lower level of service is now called &quot;limited sanitation service&quot; which refers to use of improved sanitation facilities that are shared between two or more households.

=== Container-based sanitation ===

=== Community-based sanitation ===
Community-based sanitation is related to decentralized wastewater treatment (DEWATS).

=== Community-led total sanitation ===
=== Dry sanitation ===

The term &quot;dry sanitation&quot; is not in widespread use and is not very well defined. It usually refers to a system that uses a type of dry toilet and no sewers to transport excreta. Often when people speak of &quot;dry sanitation&quot; they mean a sanitation system that uses urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDTs).

=== Ecological sanitation ===


=== Emergency sanitation ===
=== Environmental sanitation ===
Environmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to disease transmission. Subsets of this category are solid waste management, water and wastewater treatment, industrial waste treatment and noise pollution control. According to World health organization (WHO) Environmental sanitation was defined as the control of all those factors in the physical environment which exercise a harmful effect on human being physical development, health and survival. One of the primary function of environmental sanitation is to protect public health. 

=== Fecal sludge management ===
=== Improved and unimproved sanitation ===
=== Lack of sanitation ===

Lack of sanitation refers to the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues. It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still lacked improved sanitation facilities including 660 million people who lack access to safe drinking water as of 2015.

=== Onsite sanitation or non-sewered sanitation system ===

Onsite sanitation (or on-site sanitation) is defined as &quot;a sanitation system in which excreta and wastewater are collected and stored or treated on the plot where they are generated&quot;. Another term that is used for the same system is non-sewered sanitation systems (NSSS), which are prevalent in many countries. NSSS play a vital role in the safe management of fecal sludge, accounting for approximately half of all existing sanitation provisions. The degree of treatment may be variable, from none to advanced. Examples are pit latrines (no treatment) and septic tanks (primary treatment of wastewater). On-site sanitation systems are often connected to fecal sludge management (FSM) systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated at an offsite location. Wastewater (sewage) is only generated when piped water supply is available within the buildings or close to them.

A related term is a decentralized wastewater system which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an onsite sewage facility can treat the wastewater generated locally.

The global methane emissions from NSSS in 2020 was estimated to as 377 Mt CO2e per year or 4.7% of global anthropogenic methane emissions, which are comparable to the greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment plants. This means that the GHG emissions from the NSSS as a non-negligible source.

===Safely managed sanitation===
Safely managed sanitation is the highest level of household sanitation envisioned by the Sustainable Development Goal Number 6. It is measured under the Sustainable Development Goal 6.2, Indicator 6.2.1, as the &quot;Proportion of population using (a) safely managed sanitation services and (b) a hand-washing facility with soap and water&quot;. The current value in the 2017 baseline estimate by JMP is that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation.

Safely managed sanitation is defined as an improved sanitation facility which is not shared with other households, and where the excreta produced is either treated and disposed in situ, stored temporarily and then emptied and transported to treatment off-site, or transported through a sewer with wastewater and then treated off-site. In other words, safely managed sanitation is a basic sanitation service where in addition excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.

=== Sustainable sanitation ===
== Other types, concepts and systems ==

=== Wastewater management ===
Wastewater management consists of collection, wastewater treatment (be it municipal or industrial wastewater), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as water reclamation.

Sanitation systems in urban areas of developed countries usually consist of the collection of wastewater in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in wastewater treatment plants for reuse or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea.

In developing countries most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. Alternatives to centralized sewer systems include onsite sanitation, decentralized wastewater systems, dry toilets connected to fecal sludge management.

=== Stormwater drainage ===

Sewers are either combined with storm drains or separated from them as sanitary sewers. Combined sewers are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy rainfall and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or sanitary sewer overflows, i.e., more or less diluted raw sewage being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.

===Solid waste disposal===
Disposal of solid waste is most commonly conducted in landfills, but incineration, recycling, composting and conversion to biofuels are also avenues. In the case of landfills, advanced countries typically have rigid protocols for daily cover with topsoil, where underdeveloped countries customarily rely upon less stringent protocols. The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of pathogens. Daily cover also minimizes odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of leachate that could contaminate groundwater (and hence jeopardize some drinking water supplies).

For incineration options, the release of air pollutants, including certain toxic components is an attendant adverse outcome. Recycling and biofuel conversion are the sustainable options that generally have superior lifecycle costs, particularly when total ecological consequences are considered. Composting value will ultimately be limited by the market demand for compost product.

===Food safety===
Sanitation within the food industry means the adequate treatment of food-contact surfaces by a process that is effective in destroying vegetative cells of microorganisms of public health significance, and in substantially reducing numbers of other undesirable microorganisms, but without adversely affecting the food or its safety for the consumer (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Code of Federal Regulations, 21CFR110, USA). Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures are mandatory for food industries in United States. Similarly, in Japan, food hygiene has to be achieved through compliance with food sanitation law.

In the food and biopharmaceutical industries, the term &quot;sanitary equipment&quot; means equipment that is fully cleanable using clean-in-place (CIP) and sterilization-in-place (SIP) procedures: that is fully drainable from cleaning solutions and other liquids. The design should have a minimum amount of deadleg, or areas where the turbulence during cleaning is insufficient to remove product deposits. In general, to improve cleanability, this equipment is made from Stainless Steel 316L, (an alloy containing small amounts of molybdenum). The surface is usually electropolished to an effective surface roughness of less than 0.5 micrometre to reduce the possibility of bacterial adhesion.

=== Hygiene promotion ===
In many settings, provision of sanitation facilities alone does not guarantee good health of the population. Studies have suggested that the impact of hygiene practices have as great an impact on sanitation related diseases as the actual provision of sanitation facilities. Hygiene promotion is therefore an important part of sanitation and is usually key in maintaining good health.

Hygiene promotion is a planned approach of enabling people to act and change their behavior in an order to reduce and/or prevent incidences of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) related diseases. It usually involves a participatory approach of engaging people to take responsibility of WASH services and infrastructure including its operation and maintenance. The three key elements of promoting hygiene are; mutual sharing of information and knowledge, the mobilization of affected communities and the provision of essential material and facilities.

=== Indicator organisms ===
When analyzing environmental samples, various types of indicator organisms are used to check for fecal pollution of the sample. Commonly used indicators for bacteriological water analysis include the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;E. coli)&quot; and non-specific fecal coliforms&quot;.&quot; With regards to samples of soil, sewage sludge, biosolids or fecal matter from dry toilets, helminth eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs. The viable fraction of the helminth eggs in the sample is then counted.

=== Sustainable Development Goal Number 6 ===

 In the year 2016, the Sustainable Development Goals replaced the Millennium Development Goals. Sanitation is a global development priority and included Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). The target is about &quot;clean water and sanitation for all&quot; by 2030. It is estimated that 660 million people still lacked access to safe drinking water as of 2015.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the fight for clean water and sanitation is more important than ever. Handwashing is one of the most common prevention methods for Coronavirus, yet two out of five people do not have access to a hand-washing station.

==== Millennium Development Goal Number 7 until 2015 ====
The United Nations, during the Millennium Summit in New York in 2000 and the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, developed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) aimed at poverty eradication and sustainable development. The specific sanitation goal for the year 2015 was to reduce by half the number of people who had no access to potable water and sanitation in the baseline year of 1990. As the JMP and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report in 2006 has shown, progress meeting the MDG sanitation target is slow, with a large gap between the target coverage and the current reality. In December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly declared 2008 &quot;The International Year of Sanitation&quot;, in recognition of the slow progress being made towards the MDGs sanitation target. The year aimed to develop awareness and more actions to meet the target.

There are numerous reasons for this gap. A major one is that sanitation is rarely given political attention received by other topics despite its key importance. Sanitation is not high on the international development agenda, and projects such as those relating to water supply projects are emphasised.

The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF (JMP) has been publishing reports of updated estimates every two years on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels. The JMP report for 2015 stated that:
* Between 1990 and 2015, open defecation rates have decreased from 38% to 25% globally. Just under one billion people (946 million) still practise open defecation worldwide in 2015.
* 82% of the global urban population, and 51% of the rural population is using improved sanitation facilities in 2015, as per the JMP definition of &quot;improved sanitation&quot;.

=== Initiatives to promote sanitation ===
In 2011 the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation launched the &quot;Reinvent the Toilet Challenge&quot; to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human waste. The program is aimed at developing technologies that might help bridge the global sanitation gap (for example the Omni Processor, or technology for fecal sludge management). In 2015, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation published their &quot;Water, sanitation, and hygiene strategy portfolio update and overview&quot; called &quot;Building demand for sanitation&quot;.

The latest innovations in the field of public health sanitation, currently in the testing phase, comprise - use of &#x27;locally produced alcohol-based hand rub&#x27;; &#x27;novel latrine improvement&#x27;; and &#x27;container-based sanitation&#x27;. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the national public health agency of the United States has recognized the stated three initiatives.

=== Capacity development ===
Capacity development is regarded as an important mechanism to achieve progress in the sanitation sector. For example, in India the Sanitation Capacity Building platform (SCBP) was designed to &quot;support and build the capacity of town/cities to plan and implement decentralized sanitation solutions&quot; with funding by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation from 2015 to 2022. Results from this project showed that capacity development best happens on the job and in a learning organization culture. In a government capacity development initiative, it is critical to have an enabling policy and program funding to translate capacity development input into program and infrastructure outputs. Capacity development aims to empower staff and institutions, develop a learning strategy, learning content and training modules, as well as strengthened partnerships and institutions of learning. The Capacity Development Effectiveness Ladder Framework (CDEL) identifies five critical steps for capacity development interventions: Developing original learning content, partnerships for learning and outreach, learning strategy, visioning change and designing solutions, contribution to capacity development discourse.

==Costs==

A study was carried out in 2018 to compare the lifecycle costs of full sanitation chain systems in developing cities of Africa and Asia. It found that conventional sewer systems are in most cases the most expensive sanitation options, followed, in order of cost, by sanitation systems comprising septic tanks, ventilated improved pit latrines (VIP), urine diversion dry toilets and pour-flush pit latrines. The main determinants of urban sanitation financial costs include: Type of technology, labour, material and utility cost, density, topography, level of service provided by the sanitation system, soil condition, energy cost and others (distance to wastewater treatment facility, climate, end-use of treatment products, business models, water table height).

Some grassroots organizations have trialled community-managed toilet blocks whose construction and maintenance costs can be covered by households. One study of Mumbai informal settlements found that US$1.58 per adult would be sufficient for construction, and less than US$1/household/month would be sufficient for maintenance.

==History==
Major human settlements could initially develop only where fresh surface water was plentiful, such as near rivers or natural springs. Throughout history people have devised systems to get water into their communities and households, and to dispose (and later also treat) wastewater. The focus of sewage treatment at that time was on conveying raw sewage to a natural body of water, e.g. a river or ocean, where it would be diluted and dissipated.

The Sanitation in the Indus Valley Civilization in Asia is an example of public water supply and sanitation during the Bronze Age (3300–1300 BCE). Sanitation in ancient Rome was quite extensive. These systems consisted of stone and wooden drains to collect and remove wastewater from populated areas—see for instance the Cloaca Maxima into the River Tiber in Rome. The first sewers of ancient Rome were built between 800 and 735 BCE.

==By country==
==Society and culture==

There is a vast number of professions that are involved in the field of sanitation, for example on the technical and operations side: sanitation workers, waste collectors, sanitary engineers.

<doc id="184730" wikidata="Q4527" url="?curid=184730" title="Western Ghats">
<text>The Western Ghats, also known as the Sahyadri, is a mountain range that stretches along the western coast of the Indian peninsula. Covering an area of , it traverses the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. The range forms an almost continuous chain of mountains along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, from the Tapti River to Swamithoppe in Kanyakumari district at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula. The Western Ghats meet with the Eastern Ghats at Nilgiris before continuing south.

Geologic evidence indicates that the mountains were formed during the break-up of the supercontinent of Gondwana. The mountains came along the west coast of India somewhere in the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods when India separated from the African continent. The mountains can be roughly divided into three parts: the northern section with an elevation ranging from , the middle section starting from the south of Goa with a lower elevation of less than , and the southern section where the altitude rises again. The Western Ghats have several peaks that rise above , with Anamudi () being the highest peak. The average elevation is around .

The Western Ghats form one of the major watersheds of India, feeding many perennial river systems that drain almost 40% of the land area of the country. Because of the higher elevation of the Deccan plateau on the west, most rivers flow from eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal, resulting in chiselled eastern slopes and steeper western slopes facing the Arabian Sea. The Western Ghats play an important role in determining the climate and seasons in India. It blocks the rain-bearing monsoon winds flowing eastward from the Arabian Sea, resulting in rainfall along the western coast. By the time the air rises above the mountains, it becomes dry, forming a rain shadow region with very little rainfall on the leeward side towards the interior of the Deccan plateau.

The Western Ghats region is a biodiversity hotspot. It contains a large number of different species of flora and fauna, most of which are endemic to this region. At least 325 globally threatened species occur in the Western Ghats. The region was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012.

== Etymology ==
The name Western Ghats derives from the word ghat and the cardinal direction in which it is located with respect to the Indian mainland. &quot;Ghat&quot;, a term used in the Indian subcontinent, depending on the context, could either refer to a range of stepped hills such as the Eastern Ghats and Western Ghats, or a series of steps leading down to a body of water or wharf. As per linguist Thomas Burrow, the word &quot;Ghat&quot; was derived from similar words used in various Dravidian languages such as &quot;kattu&quot; (mountain side, ridge, or dam) in Tamil, &quot;katte&quot; (dam), &quot;gatta&quot; (mountain), and &quot;gattu&quot; (bank or shore) in Kannada, and &quot;katta&quot; (dam), and &quot;gatte&quot; (shore or embankment) in Telugu. The ancient name for the mountain range is &quot;Sahyadri&quot;, derived from Sanskrit, meaning benevolent or tolerant mountain.

== Geology ==
The Western Ghats are the mountainous faulted, and eroded edge of the Deccan Plateau. Geologic evidence indicates that they were formed during the break-up of the super-continent of Gondwana. After the break-up, the Deccan plateau was formed by basalt rocks, which caused the western side to rise at an elevation.

Geophysical evidence indicates that the mountains came along the west coast of India somewhere in the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods when India separated from the African continent. Several faults triggered the formation of Western Ghats, then interspersed with valleys and river gorges. Because of the elevation of the Deccan plateau on the west, most rivers flow from west to east, resulting in chiselled eastern slopes and steeper western slopes facing the sea.

== Geography ==

The Western Ghats extend from the Satpura Range south of the Tapti River in the north and runs approximately to the southern tip of the Indian peninsula, where it ends at the Marunthuvazh Malai at Swamithoppe in Kanyakumari district. It covers an area of , traversing the Indian states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.

The Western Ghats form an almost continuous chain of mountains running parallel to the western coast of India along the Arabian Sea. The average elevation is around . There are three gaps in the mountain range: the northernmost Goa Gap, formed 65–80 million years ago (Mya), the oldest and widest Palghat Gap, formed 500 Mya, and the southernmost, narrowest Shencottah Gap. The narrow coastal plain between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea is known as the Western Coastal Plains.

The mountains can be roughly divided into three parts: the northern section with an elevation ranging from , the middle section starting from the south of Goa with a lower elevation of less than , and the southern section where the altitude rises again. The Western Ghats meet with the Eastern Ghats at Nilgiris before continuing south. The Western Ghats have many peaks that rise above , with Anamudi () being the highest peak.

=== Hydrography ===
The Western Ghats form one of the major watersheds of India, feeding many perennial rivers. These major river systems drain almost 40% of the land area of the country. The major river systems originating in the Western Ghats are the Godavari, Kaveri, and Krishna. Most rivers flow eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal owing to the steeper gradient moving from east to west, and many smaller streams drain the region, often carrying a large volume of water during the monsoon months. The streams and rivers give rise to numerous waterfalls in the region. The rivers have been dammed for hydroelectric and irrigation purposes, with major reservoirs spread across the region.

== Climate ==
The Western Ghats play an important role in determining the climate and seasons in India. During the dry summer months of AprilMay, heat builds up on the land, which draws air from the sea. The air, which picks up moisture along the way and flows eastward from the Arabian Sea, is blocked by the Western Ghats. The rising air cools and brings about orographic precipitation along the western coast. This signifies the onset of the monsoon season in June. By the time the air rises above the mountains, it becomes dry, resulting in a rain shadow region with very little rainfall on the leeward side towards the interior of the Deccan plateau. The monsoon winds rounding up the peninsula and moving from the east from the Bay of Bengal pass over the Eastern Ghats and bring the majority of the rainfall to the plains up north.

Climate in the mountains shows variations with altitude across the range. Due to its physical proximity to the equator and the Arabian Sea, the region experiences a warm and humid tropical climate throughout the year. Mean temperatures range from in the south to in the north. Subtropical or temperate climates, and occasional near-zero temperatures during winter are experienced in regions with higher elevations. The coldest period in the region are the wettest monsoon period in the southern part of the mountain range. Annual rainfall in this region averages to , with an average rainfall of . The total amount of rain does not depend on the spread of the area; areas in northern Maharashtra receive heavy rainfall followed by long dry spells, while regions closer to the equator receive lower annual rainfall and have rain spells lasting several months in a year.

== Biodiversity ==
The Western Ghats region is a biodiversity hotspot. It consists of nearly 30% of all the species of flora and fauna found in India, most of which are endemic to this region. At least 325 globally threatened species occur in the Western Ghats.

=== Flora ===
The Western Ghats consist of four tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf terrestrial ecoregions of the Indomalayan realm, with the northern portion of the range generally drier than the southern portion. These include the following:


Other types of ecosystems include dry deciduous forests on the leeward rain shadow region, scrub forests at the foothills, peat bogs, and swamps. Montane grasslands are found in high altitude locations in the south Western Ghats interspersed with sholas, a unique type of stunted tropical montane forest found in the valleys between the mountains.

Earlier sources indicated about four to five thousand vascular plant species of which nearly one-third was endemic to the region. Later studies and publications have recorded 7,402 species of flowering plants occurring in the Western Ghats of which 5,588 were described as indigenous, 376 are naturalized exotics, and 1,438 species are cultivated or planted. Among the indigenous species, 2,253 species are endemic to India and of them, 1,273 species are exclusively confined to the Western Ghats. 645 tree species were recorded with a high endemic ratio of 56%. There are 850 to 1,000 species of bryophytes, including 682 species of mosses (28% endemic) and 280 species of liverworts (43% endemic), 277 species of pteridophytes and 949 species of lichens (26.7% endemic).

=== Fauna ===
The Western Ghats are home to thousands of species of fauna, including at least 325 globally threatened species. As per a 2010 report, following is the distribution of faunal species in the Western Ghats apart from more than 6,000 insect species.

The Western Ghats region has one of the highest tiger populations, estimated at 985 in 2022. The Western Ghats ecoregion has the largest Indian elephant population in the wild, with an estimated 11,000 individuals across eight distinct populations. Other mammals include endangered and vulnerable species such as the lion-tailed macaque, Nilgiri tahr, leopard, Nilgiri langur, dhole, and gaur. The endemic Nilgiri tahr, which was on the brink of extinction, has recovered and had an estimated 3,122 individuals in 2015. Smaller endemic species include the Malabar large-spotted civet, Nilgiri marten, brown palm civet, stripe-necked mongoose, Indian brown mongoose, small Indian civet, and leopard cat.

As per a 2014 report, at least 227 species of reptiles are found in the Western Ghats. The major population of the snake family Uropeltidae is restricted to the region. Several endemic reptile genera and species occur here, with the region having a significant population of mugger crocodiles. The amphibians of the Western Ghats are diverse and unique, with a high proportion of species being endemic to the tropical rainforests of India. New frog species have continued to be discovered in the 21st century. Frogs of the genera &quot;Micrixalus, Indirana&quot;, and &quot;Nyctibatrachus&quot;, toads like &quot;Pedostibes, Ghatophryne&quot;, and &quot;Xanthophryne&quot;, arboreal frogs like &quot;Ghatixalus, Mercurana&quot;, and &quot;Beddomixalus&quot;, and microhylids like &quot;Melanobatrachus&quot; are endemic to this region.

There are at least 19 species of birds endemic to the Western Ghats, including the endangered rufous-breasted laughingthrush, the vulnerable Nilgiri wood-pigeon, white-bellied shortwing, and broad-tailed grassbird, the near threatened grey-breasted laughingthrush, black-and-rufous flycatcher, Nilgiri flycatcher, and Nilgiri pipit, and the least concern Malabar (blue-winged) parakeet, Malabar grey hornbill, white-bellied treepie, grey-headed bulbul, rufous babbler, Wayanad laughingthrush, white-bellied blue-flycatcher, and the crimson-backed sunbird.

;Fishes and molluscs
There is a higher fish species richness in the southern part of the Western Ghats. There are 13 genera entirely restricted to the Western Ghats (&quot;Betadevario&quot;, &quot;Dayella&quot;, &quot;Haludaria&quot;, &quot;Horabagrus&quot;, &quot;Horalabiosa&quot;, &quot;Hypselobarbus&quot;, &quot;Indoreonectes&quot;, &quot;Lepidopygopsis&quot;, &quot;Longischistura&quot;, &quot;Mesonoemacheilus&quot;, &quot;Parapsilorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Rohtee&quot;, and &quot;Travancoria&quot;). The most species-rich families are the Cyprinids (72 species), hillstream loaches (34 species; including stone loaches, now regarded a separate family), Bagrid catfishes (19 species), and Sisorid catfishes (12 species). The region is home to several ornamental fishes like the Denison (or red line torpedo) barb, melon barb, several species of &quot;Dawkinsia&quot; barbs, zebra loach, &quot;Horabagrus&quot; catfish, dwarf pufferfish and dwarf Malabar pufferfish. The rivers are also home to &quot;Osteobrama bakeri&quot;, and larger species such as the Malabar snakehead, and Malabar mahseer. A few are adapted to an underground life, including some &quot;Rakthamichthys&quot; swamp eels, and the catfish &quot;Horaglanis&quot; and &quot;Kryptoglanis&quot;. 97 freshwater fish species were considered threatened in 2011, including 12 critically endangered, 54 endangered, and 31 vulnerable. The reservoirs in the region are important for their commercial and sport fisheries of rainbow trout, mahseer, and common carp. There are more than 200 freshwater fish species including 35 also known from brackish or marine water. Several new species have been described from the region since the last decade (e.g., &quot;Dario urops&quot; and &quot;S. sharavathiensis&quot;).

Seasonal rainfall patterns in the Western Ghats necessitate a period of dormancy for its land snails, resulting in their high abundance and diversity, including at least 258 species of gastropods from 57 genera and 24 families. A total of 77 species of freshwater molluscs (52 gastropods and 25 bivalves) have been recorded from the Western Ghats, but the actual number is likely higher. This includes 28 endemics. Among the threatened freshwater molluscs are the mussel species &quot;Pseudomulleria dalyi&quot;, which is a Gondwanan relict, and the snail &quot;Cremnoconchus&quot;, which is restricted to the spray zone of waterfalls. According to the IUCN, four species of freshwater molluscs are considered endangered and three are vulnerable. An additional 19 species are considered data deficient.

;Insects
There are roughly 6,000 insect species. Of the 334 Western Ghats butterfly species, 316 species have been reported to occur in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The Western Ghats are home to 174 species of odonates (107 dragonflies and 67 damselflies), including 69 endemics. Most of the endemic odonate are closely associated with rivers and streams, while the non-endemics are typically generalists. There are several species of leeches found all along the Western Ghats.

=== Threats and conservation ===
Historically, the Western Ghats were covered in dense forests. which formed the natural habitat for wildlife along with the native tribal people. Its inaccessibility made it difficult for people from the plains to cultivate the land and build settlements. After the establishment of British colonial rule in the region, large swathes of territory were cleared for agricultural plantations and timber. The forests in the Western Ghats were severely fragmented due to clear-felling for plantations. The introduction of non-native species threatened the rare endemic species and habitat specialists, which depleted faster than other species. Complex and species-rich habitats like the tropical rainforests are much more adversely affected than other habitats. The primary threats to fauna were not only from habitat loss, but also from overexploitation, illicit grazing, mining, poaching, and introduced species.

The Government of India has established many protected areas, including two biosphere reserves, 13 national parks to restrict human access, several wildlife sanctuaries to protect specific endangered species, and many reserve forests. The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, comprising of the forests, forms the largest contiguous protected area in the Western Ghats. In August 2011, the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel (WGEEP), appointed by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests to assess the biodiversity and environmental issues of the Western Ghats, designated the entire region as an Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA) and assigned three levels of Ecological Sensitivity to its different regions. Subsequent committees formed have recommended various suggestions to protect the region. In 2006, India applied to the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme (MAB) for the Western Ghats to be listed as a protected World Heritage Site. In 2012, 39 sites divided into seven clusters across the Western Ghats, were declared as World Heritage Sites.

<doc id="184735" wikidata="Q7596573" url="?curid=184735" title="Staff of office">
<text>A staff of office is a staff, the carrying of which often denotes an official&#x27;s position, a social rank or a degree of social prestige.

Apart from the ecclesiastical and ceremonial usages mentioned below, there are less formal usages. A gold- or silver-topped cane can express social standing (or dandyism). Teachers or prefects in schools traditionally carried less elaborate canes which marked their right (and potential threat) to administer canings, and military officers carry a residual threat of physical punishment in their swagger sticks. Orchestral conductors have in their batons symbols of authority as well as tools of their trade.

==Ecclesiastical use==

Churchwardens (and sometimes sidesmen) traditionally carry staves or wands on special occasions as an emblem of their office.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and some of the Oriental Orthodox Churches an ecclesiastical walking stick is used by bishops, archimandrites and hegumens (abbots) when walking outside. It is usually made of dark wood and is straight, rather than having a curved handle. The walking stick used by bishops and archimandrites is normally adorned with a silver grip at the top and a metal ferrule at the tip. The walking stick used by a hegumen or hegumenia (abbess) is normally of plain wood, unadorned. The walking stick is not used in any liturgical context, except to the extent that when a bishop is formally received at the beginning of the service, he will carry it as he walks into the church. An altar server will usually take it from him when he enters the narthex and return it to him when he leaves at the end of the service.

Western bishops may use a crozier or crook in a liturgical setting as a symbol of their pastoral authority.

==State and ceremonial use==
Monarchs often have a rod or sceptre signifying their office, and field-marshals are traditionally given a short thick baton in several countries. There are also offices which take their titles from their staff, such as Black Rod, the Tipstaff, Gold Stick and Silver Stick.

===White staves===

A thin white staff or &quot;wand&quot; is the traditional emblem of certain Great Officers of State and high-ranking officials of the Royal Household in the United Kingdom, namely:

Great Officers of State:

* The Lord High Treasurer
* The Lord High Steward
* The Lord Great Chamberlain

Senior Officers of the Household:
* The Lord Steward
* The Lord Chamberlain
* Treasurer of the Household
* Comptroller of the Household
* Vice-Chamberlain of the Household

The &quot;wand&quot;, which is around in length, is made of white wood and has a silver plate at its base on which is engraved the name of the office to which it pertains. The wands are carried by their holders when on duty on state or other royal occasions, such as state banquets, jubilee services and royal weddings, as well as at the State Opening of Parliament (when the Lord Great Chamberlain raises his white staff to signal to the king&#x27;s messenger, Black Rod, to summon the Commons).

Apart from the Lord High Steward (an office which is only now filled for coronations), all the above-listed officials were seen carrying their white staves during the State funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. The Lord Chamberlain, as executive head of the Royal Household, ceremonially breaks his white staff at the monarch&#x27;s state funeral, when he automatically loses office; it is then buried with the sovereign. This was publicly observed at the committal service of Elizabeth II on 19 September 2022 (the first time such a service had been filmed or televised), when the incumbent, Lord Parker of Minsmere, performed this duty. The ritual, sometimes referred to as the &quot;breaking of the stick&quot;, goes back many centuries (at one time all the officers of the Household who carried white staves would break them at this point and throw them into the grave, but since the 18th century the Lord Chamberlain alone has done so). The staff used to be physically broken, but in modern time it is jointed in the middle and the two halves can be separated.

The Lords with White Staves (namely the Lord Steward and Lord Chamberlain) are traditionally responsible for presenting addresses from the House of Lords to the Sovereign, and then delivering the Sovereign&#x27;s response to the House. The Vice-Chamberlain of the Household today fulfils a similar role with regard to the House of Commons.

A queen consort traditionally has a separate Household, headed by her own Lord Chamberlain, who is likewise invested with a white staff. Following the funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, her Lord Chamberlain (the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres) attended the private interment service and likewise broke his white staff in two over her coffin.

===Other state and ceremonial officers===

The Earl Marshal and the Lord High Constable carry batons as their insignia when on duty, reflecting the military origins of those offices.

Garter King-of-Arms has carried a gold or silver rod on state occasions since 1522. In 1906 the other officers of arms were similarly each provided with a gold-mounted ebony baton, decorated with their individual badge of office; in 1953 these were replaced with white staves, topped with a blue dove within a gold coronet.

On great occasions of state the Earl Marshal may appoint officers to assist in the marshalling of processions and other duties; they are provided with a wooden staff of office as a symbol of their authority, the colour of which varies depending on the occasion: reflecting this, those on duty at Coronations are known as Gold Staff Officers, those on duty at State Funerals Purple Staff Officers, and in 1911 and 1969 those on duty at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales were termed Green Staff Officers.

<text>Fairness &amp; Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) is a progressive left-leaning media critique organization based in New York City. The organization was founded in 1986 by Jeff Cohen and Martin A. Lee. FAIR monitors American news media for bias, inaccuracies and censorship, and advocates for more diversity of perspectives in the news media. FAIR describes itself as &quot;the national media watch group&quot;.

FAIR publishes &quot;Extra!&quot;, a magazine of media criticism, and also produces the radio program &quot;CounterSpin&quot;, which features interviews with journalists, scholars, and activists on current media-related news stories.

==Mission==
FAIR describes itself on its website as &quot;the national media watch group&quot; and defines its mission as working to &quot;invigorate the First Amendment by advocating for greater diversity in the press and by scrutinizing media practices that marginalize public interest, minority and dissenting viewpoints.&quot; FAIR refers to itself as a &quot;progressive group that believes that structural reform is ultimately needed to break up the dominant media conglomerates, establish independent public broadcasting and promote strong nonprofit sources of information.&quot; 

Commentators on FAIR&#x27;s syndicated radio program, &quot;CounterSpin&quot;, have frequently argued that American media is biased in favor of conservatism. Professor of public policy Terry J. Buss has argued that FAIR combines media criticism and partisan advocacy for progressive causes, and that their criticism of conservative groups is done &quot;more on ideological grounds than on substance&quot;.

FAIR believes that corporate sponsorship and ownership, as well as government policies and pressure, restricts journalism and therefore distorts public discourse. FAIR also believes that most news media reflects the interests of business and government elites while ignoring or minimizing minority, female, public interest, and dissenting points of view. FAIR criticizes media outlets for engaging in false balance in order to not be accused of taking sides on controversial topics.

<text>Málaga (; ) is a municipality of Spain, capital of the Province of Málaga, in the autonomous community of Andalusia. With a population of 591,637 in 2024, it is the second-most populous city in Andalusia and the sixth most populous in the country. It lies in Southern Iberia on the Costa del Sol (&quot;Coast of the Sun&quot;) of the Mediterranean, primarily in the left bank of the Guadalhorce. The urban core originally developed in the space between the Gibralfaro Hill and the Guadalmedina.

Málaga&#x27;s history spans about 2,800 years, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Western Europe. According to most scholars, it was founded about 770BC by the Phoenicians from Tyre as &quot;Malaka&quot;. From the 6th centuryBC the city was under the hegemony of Ancient Carthage, and from 218BC, it was under Roman rule, economically prospering owing to garum production. In the 8th century, after a period of Visigothic and Byzantine rule, it was placed under Islamic rule. In 1487, the Crown of Castile gained control in the midst of the Granada War. In the 19th century, the city underwent a period of industrialisation followed by a decay in all socioeconomic parametres in the last third of the century.

The most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand. Málaga has consolidated as a tech hub, with companies mainly concentrated in the Málaga TechPark (Technology Park of Andalusia). It hosts the headquarters of the region&#x27;s largest bank, Unicaja, and it is the fourth-ranking city in Spain in terms of economic activity behind Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. Regarding transportation, Málaga is served by the Málaga–Costa del Sol Airport and the Port of Málaga, and the city was connected to the high-speed railway network in 2007.

== History ==

Phoenicians from Tyre founded a colony named &quot;Málaka&quot; () or &quot;Malake&quot; about 770BC (, ). The town controlled access to the Guadalmedina and served as a waypoint on trade routes between Phoenicia and the Strait of Gibraltar. Like other Phoenician colonies, it fell under Carthaginian rule during the 6th or 5th centuryBC. The Phoenician and Later Roman urban core developed around an area running from the Gibralfaro Hill to the mouth of the &quot;Malaca flumen&quot; (Guadalmedina).

After the Punic Wars, the Roman Republic took control of the town known to them as &quot;Malaca&quot;. By the 1st century BC, Strabo alluded to its Phoenician profile, in contrast to the hellenized characteristics of the neighbouring settlement of &quot;Mainake&quot;.

Transformed into a confederated city, it was under a special law, the &quot;Lex Flavia Malacitana&quot;. A Roman theatre was built at this time. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled first by the Visigoths. The city was taken by the Byzantine Empire; either Malaca or Carthago Nova possibly then becoming the capital of the province of Spania. The Byzantines restored and expanded the docks, thus consolidating the fishing and trading tradition the city already enjoyed. The city was retaken by the Visigoth King Sisebuto in 615. The Islamic conquest of Málaga (rendered as —&quot;Mālaqah&quot;—in Arab sources) by Arab and Berber forces took place in 711 or perhaps 713. Following a period of diminished importance during the early stages of the emiral period already in force since before the conquest, Málaga was fully Islamized by the end of the aforementioned period in the wake of Muhammad I&#x27;s attributed intervention in the urban configuration as a &quot;medina&quot;.
The consolidation of the city&#x27;s importance after 930 (under the Caliphate of Córdoba) ran parallel to the diminishing fortune of Archidona, the latter of which Málaga replaced as the capital of the corresponding &quot;kura&quot; of Rayya. The early 10th-century chronicle of Aḥmad al-Rāzī mentions the vineyards of Málaga, extolling the unparalleled quality of its raisins. In the 11th century, following the unravelling of Umayyad authority across the caliphate, Málaga became a centre of power of the Hammudids, who established a petty kingdom (nominally also a caliphate) in the city, the taifa of Málaga, complemented by the also Hammudid sister dominion in Ceuta across the Strait of Gibraltar. The city was seized away from the Hammudids by the Granadan Zirids in 1056 or 1057, and also underwent an ephemeral spell under the Sevillian Abbadids by 1066 before returning to the former. By the late 11th century, the Zirids lost the city to the North-African Almoravids.

The traveller Ibn Battuta, who passed through around 1325, characterised it as &quot;one of the largest and most beautiful towns of Andalusia [uniting] the conveniences of both sea and land, and... abundantly supplied with foodstuffs and fruits&quot;. He praised its grapes, figs, and almonds; &quot;its ruby-coloured Murcian pomegranates have no equal in the world.&quot; Another exported product was its &quot;excellent gilded pottery&quot;. The town&#x27;s mosque was large, with &quot;exceptionally tall orange trees&quot; in its courtyard.

After the formation of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in the 13th century, Málaga became a part of it. The export-oriented harbour traded silk fabrics, dry nuts (raisins, almonds and the famous Rayya figs, reportedly exported to as far as China), vine, cutlery, leather and the famous regional lustreware.

In the 15th century, Málaga was the main Nasrid port (followed by Almería), featuring a notable presence of Genoese merchants. It played a role both as stopover of the Atlantic international trade (as part of the routes connecting the Central Mediterranean to the North Atlantic) and as regional trading cog of the Kingdom of Granada. By the last rales of Nasrid rule, the city had a population of about 15,000.

Málaga was seized by Christian forces on 18 August 1487, after a 3-month 11 days siege, in what was the most violent episode of the Granada War. The Muslim inhabitants resisted assaults and artillery bombardments before hunger forced them to surrender; practically the entire remaining population (around 11,000 people) became war captives and were sold into slavery in other Andalusian cities as well as Valencia and Barcelona. Only a minority of around 50 people led by merchant Alí Dordux were allowed to remain in the city.
The city&#x27;s Muslim population was converted to Catholic Christianity and the city was swiftly repopulated by Christian settlers coming from different locations of the Iberian Peninsula. Málaga became an exporting centre for Andalusia via the link of the city with Antequera and Córdoba, maintaining its trading character despite the nearly complete replacement of the population. The city did not escape a series of typhus fever outbreaks following its annexation to the Crown of Castile.

Following the death of regent Ferdinand the city rose in revolt in 1516 on the occasion of the installment of a new court controlled by the Admiral of Castile. It was only on 2 December 1530 when Málaga was freed from the influence of the Admiralty for good, confirming the privileges granted in the past by the Catholic Monarchs.

As of 1625, Málaga may have had a population of around 36,000.

On 24 August 1704 the indecisive Battle of Málaga, the largest naval battle in the War of the Spanish Succession, took place in the sea south of Málaga.

The city&#x27;s economy profited from an early industrialisation in the first third of the 19th century and the population steadily increased until the last years of the century, when the population decreased between 1887 and 1897 due to induced by the Phylloxera grapevine pest. The century saw the accumulation of capital in an enriched bourgeoisie class, that invested in the incipient industrial development.

The municipality of Málaga annexed the coastal town of Torremolinos in 1924.
After the coup of July 1936 the government of the Second Republic retained control of Málaga. Its harbour was a base of the Republican navy at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. It suffered heavy bombing by Italian warships which took part in breaking the Republican navy&#x27;s blockade of Nationalist-held Spanish Morocco and took part in naval bombardment of Republican-held Málaga. After the Battle of Málaga and the Francoist takeover in February 1937, over seven thousand people were killed, as they were trying to flee the city through the road to Almería.

Torremolinos—originally a small coastal town—greatly developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, becoming an international tourist centre. The first gay bar in Spain was opened in Torremolinos in 1962 (and the first lesbian club in 1968), and the place acquired a lively LGBT life, to the point of being described as &quot;the most &#x27;cosmopolitan&#x27; and gay-friendly place in all of Spain&quot;. Nearly a decade after, in 1971, a policial crackdown seeking to curb &quot;offences against public morality and decency&quot; largely put an end to the appeal of the place, only regaining its status as hub of LGBT leisure and tourism after the death of the dictator.

Torremolinos became independent from the municipality of Málaga in September 1988.

==Geography==
===Location===
Málaga is located in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, on the Costa del Sol (&quot;Coast of the Sun&quot;) on the northern side of the Alboran Sea (the westernmost portion of the Mediterranean Sea). It lies about east of the Strait of Gibraltar and about east of Tarifa (the southernmost point of continental Europe) and about to the north of Africa.

The Montes de Málaga mountain range (part of the Penibaetic System) is located in the northeast of the municipality. The highest point in the range (and in the municipality) is the &quot;Pico Reina&quot;, rising up to above sea level.

The city centre is located around the mouth of the Guadalmedina and close to the Guadalhorce&#x27;s mouth (where the airport is located). The Totalán Creek constitutes the eastern boundary of Málaga with the municipality of Rincón de la Victoria.

The Gibralfaro is a high foothill from which the and the Alcazaba fortress overlook the city.

===Climate===
Málaga&#x27;s climate is a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;, Trewartha+Universal Thermal Scale: &quot;Csal&quot;) with mild winters, during which most of the year&#x27;s rainfall occurs, and hot summers with very little rainfall. Summer to early-autumn tends to be moderately humid, due to the evaporation of warm water off the adjacent Mediterranean Sea being blown on shore by a sea breeze. This humidity is most pronounced at this time of year as the sea water is at its warmest in relation to the rest of the year. On particularly humid days, which occasionally occurs, the apparent temperature feels higher than the actual temperature would suggest, especially when the wind is light. When the wind is stronger, this effect is lessened somewhat, and the heat feels more manageable.&lt;ref name=&quot;malaga.com/geo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Málaga enjoys plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of about 300 days of sunshine and only about 40–45 with precipitation annually.

Málaga experiences the warmest winters of any European city with a population over 500,000. The average maximum temperature during the day in the period from December to February is . During the winter, the Málaga Mountains (&quot;Montes de Málaga&quot;) block the passage of cold winds from the north. Its average annual temperature is during the day and at night. In the coldest month, January, the temperature ranges from during the day, at night and the average sea temperature is . In the warmest month, August, the temperature ranges from during the day, above at night and the average sea temperature is .

Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded at the airport was on 18 July 1978, equalled on 19 July 2023. In August 1881, the average reported daytime maximum temperature was a record . The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 4 February 1954. The highest wind speed ever recorded was on 16 July 1980, measuring . Snowfall is virtually unknown; since the beginning of the 20th century, Málaga city has only recorded snow on one day, on 2 February 1954.

Annual average relative humidity is 65%, ranging from 58% in June to 72% in December. Yearly sunshine hours average between 2,800 and 3,000 per year, from 5–6 hours of sunshine per day in December to average 11 hours of sunshine per day in July.

At Málaga Airport weather station, annual wind speeds average from in December, January and February, to in September and October. Atmospheric pressure averages from 1015 mbar in July and August to 1023 mbar in January. Visibility averages either 11 or 12 km in all months. The strongest gust of wind recorded at this station was on 27 January 1948 at 02:30. On 12 December 2023, Málaga broke Spain&#x27;s and Europe&#x27;s all-time December temperature record, settling a new record of at the AEMET station of Málaga and at the airport of Málaga.

== Subdivisions ==
Málaga is divided into 11 municipal districts.
==Main sites==
The old historic centre of Málaga reaches the harbour to the south. In the north it is surrounded by mountains, the Montes de Málaga (part of the Baetic Cordillera) lying in the southern base of the Axarquía hills, and two rivers, the Guadalmedina – the historic center is located on its left bank – and the Guadalhorce, which flows west of the city into the Mediterranean, in the Churriana district.

The oldest architectural remains in the city are the walls of the Phoenician city, which are visible in the cellar of the Museo Picasso Málaga.

The Roman theatre of Málaga, which dates from the 1st century BC, was rediscovered in 1951.

The Moors left posterity the dominating presence of the Castle of Gibralfaro, which is connected to the Alcazaba, the lower fortress and royal residence. Both were built during the Taifa period (11th century) and extended during the Nasrid period (13th and 14th centuries). The Alcazaba stands on a hill within the city. Originally, it defended the city from the incursions of pirates. Later, in the 11th century, it was completely rebuilt by the Hammudid dynasty. Occupying the eastern hillside that rises from the sea and overlooks the city, the Alcazaba was surrounded by palms and pine trees.

Like many of the military fortifications that were constructed in Islamic Spain, the Alcazaba of Málaga featured a quadrangular plan. It was protected by an outer and inner wall, both supported by rectangular towers, between which a covered walkway led up the slope to the Gibralfaro (this was the only exchange between the two sites). Due to its rough and awkward hillside topography, corridors throughout the site provided a means of communications for administrative and defensive operations, also affording privacy to the palatial residential quarters.

The entrance of the complex featured a grand tower that led into a sophisticated double bent entrance. After passing through several gates, open yards with gardens of pine and eucalyptus trees, and the inner wall through the Puerta de Granada, one finds the 11th- and 14th-century Governor&#x27;s palace. It was organised around a central rectangular courtyard with a triple-arched gateway and some of the rooms have been preserved to this day. An open 11th-century mirador (belvedere) to the south of this area affords views of the gardens and sea below. Measuring , this small structure highlighted scalloped, five-lobed arches. To the north of this area were a waterwheel and a Cyclopean well (penetrating below ground), a hammam, workshops and the monumental &quot;Puerta de la Torre del Homenaje&quot;, the northernmost point of the inner walls. Directly beyond was the passage to the Gibralfaro above.

The Church of Santiago (Saint James) is an example of Gothic vernacular Mudéjar, the hybrid style that evolved after the Reconquista incorporating elements from both Christian and Islamic tradition. Also from the period is the &quot;Iglesia del Sagrario&quot;, which was built on the site of the old mosque immediately after the city fell to Christian troops. It boasts a richly ornamented portal in the Isabeline-Gothic style, unique in the city.

The Cathedral and the Episcopal Palace were planned with Renaissance architectural ideals but there was a shortfall of building funds and they were finished in Baroque style.

The &quot;Basílica y Real Santuario de Santa María de la Victoria&quot;, built in the late 17th century, has a chapel in which the vertical volume is filled with elaborate Baroque plasterwork.

Other sights include:
* Walls. Phoenician, Roman, Byzantine, Arab and Spanish remains of the defensive compounds of the city.
* Church of the Sacred Heart.
* San Felipe Neri Church.
* Church of the Holy Martyrs.
* La Concepción, botanical and historical garden.
* Atarazanas Market.
* Anglican Cemetery of St. George.
* Palm grove and &quot;Muelle Uno&quot;. Port of Málaga.
* San Miguel Cemetery.
* La Malagueta bullring.
* &quot;Pedregalejo&quot;, old fishing district.
* Calle Marques de Larios, the main shopping street of the city.

==Demographics==

As of 2018, the population of Málaga is 571,026, accounting for 527,463 Spanish nationals and 43,563 foreign citizens.

The number of resident foreign nationals has risen significantly in Málaga since the 1970s.
 As of 2020, Málaga has a foreign population of 50,080.

;Metropolitan area

The urban area, stretching mostly along a narrow strip of coastline, has a population of 1,066,532 on (density 1,289 inhabitants/km2 – 2012 data). It is formed by Málaga proper together with the following adjacent towns and municipalities: Rincón de la Victoria, Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Alhaurín de la Torre, Mijas, Marbella and San Pedro Alcántara. The Málaga metropolitan area includes additional municipalities located mostly in the mountains area north of the coast and also some on the coast: Cártama, Pizarra, Coín, Monda, Ojén, Alhaurín el Grande and Estepona on west; Casabermeja on north; Totalán, Algarrobo, Torrox and Vélez-Málaga eastward from Málaga; centered Málaga urban area (Málaga, Rincón de la Victoria, Torremolinos, Benalmádena, Fuengirola, Marbella, Mijas) and Alhaurín de la Torre.

Together about 1.3 million (max. 1.6 million) people live in the Málaga metropolitan area and the number grows every year as all the municipalities and cities of the area record an annual increase in population.

==Politics and administration==

Málaga is a municipality, the basic local administrative division in Spain. The Ayuntamiento is the body charged with the municipal government and administration. The Plenary of the &quot;ayuntamiento&quot; is formed by 31 elected municipal councillors, who in turn invest the mayor. The last municipal election took place on 26 May 2019. The current mayor is Francisco de la Torre (People&#x27;s Party), who has won several mandates since becoming mayor in 2000. The city hall is located at the , a Neo-Baroque building inaugurated in 1919.

==Economy==

Málaga is the fourth-ranking city in economic activity in Spain behind Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia.
The most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction and technology services, but other sectors such as transportation and logistics are beginning to expand. The Andalusia Technology Park (PTA) (In Spanish, &quot;Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía&quot;), located in Málaga, has enjoyed significant growth since its inauguration in 1992 by the King of Spain. In 2018, this high-tech, science and industrial park employs over 16,774 workers, according to its own numbers.

In line with the city&#x27;s strategic plan, the campaign &quot;Málaga: Open for Business&quot; is directed towards the international promotion of the city on all levels but fundamentally on a business level. The campaign places a special emphasis on new technologies as well as innovation and research in order to promote the city as a reference and focal point for many global business initiatives and projects.

Málaga is a city of commerce and tourism has been a growing source of revenue, driven by the presence of a major airport, the improvement of communications, and new infrastructure such as the AVE and the maritime station, and new cultural facilities such as the Picasso Museum, the Contemporary Art Centre and Trade Fair and Congress, which have drawn more tourists.

The city hosts the International Association of Science and Technology Parks (IASP) (&quot;Asociación Internacional de Parques Tecnológicos&quot;), and a group of IT company executives and business leaders has launched an information sector initiative, Málaga Valley e-27, which seeks to make Málaga the Silicon Valley of Europe. Málaga has had strong growth in new technology industries, mainly located in the Technological Park of Andalusia, and in the construction sector. The city is home to the largest bank in Andalusia, Unicaja, and such local companies as &quot;Mayoral&quot;, &quot;Charanga&quot;, &quot;Sando&quot;, &quot;Vera&quot;, &quot;Ubago&quot;, &quot;Isofoton&quot;, &quot;Tedial&quot;, &quot;Novasoft&quot;, &quot;Grupo Vértice&quot; and &quot;Almeida viajes&quot;, and other multinationals such as Fujitsu Spain, Pernod Ricard Spain, Accenture, Epcos, Oracle Corporation, Huawei and San Miguel. In February 2021, Google decided to install a centre of excellence in cybersecurity in the city, slated for a 2023 opening. Also in 2021, Vodafone chose Málaga for the installment of a research, development and innovation centre.

==Culture==
===Feasts and festivals===
;Holy Week
Holy Week has been observed for five centuries in Málaga. Processions start on Palm Sunday and continue until Easter Sunday. Images depicting scenes from the Passion are displayed on huge ornate &quot;tronos&quot; (floats or thrones), some weighing more than . Famous is the royal archbrotherhood of Our-Lady of Hope &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Esperanza&quot;. They have more than 5,000 members and 600 . These &quot;tronos&quot; highlight the processions that go through the streets led by penitents dressed in long robes, with capirote, followed by women in black carrying candles. Drums and trumpets play music and occasionally someone spontaneously sings a mournful saeta dedicated to the floats as they make their way slowly round the streets. Some Holy Week &quot;tronos&quot; are so huge that they must be housed in places outside the churches, as they are taller than the entrance doors. Famous is the military procession of &quot;la legion&quot; (Royal congregation of Mena) playing marches and singing their anthem (El Novio de la Muerte) during procession.

;Feria de Agosto
During the celebration of the &quot;Feria de Málaga&quot; in August, the streets are transformed into traditional symbols of Spanish culture and history, with sweet wine, tapas, and live flamenco shows. The day events consist of dancing, live music (such as flamenco or &quot;verdiales&quot;, traditional music from Málaga) and bullfights at &quot;La Malagueta&quot;, while the night fair is moved to the Recinto Ferial, consisting of restaurants, clubs, and an entire fair ground with rides and games.

A contest is held in the &quot;Teatro Cervantes&quot; between groups of singers, quartets and choirs who compete in the singing of ironic songs about social and political issues. The Carnival takes to the streets of Málaga on the week before Ash Wednesday, ending on Malagueta beach with the burial of the anchovy (&quot;entierro de la sardina&quot;).

=== Gastronomy ===

The cuisine of Málaga and the wider Costa del Sol is known for its &quot;espetos&quot;, fish (most often sardines) grilled over open fires in the chiringuitos located near the beaches.

<text>The Jerusalem Post is an English language Israeli broadsheet newspaper based in Jerusalem, Israel, founded in 1932 during the British Mandate of Palestine by Gershon Agron as The Palestine Post. In 1950, it changed its name to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. In 2004, the paper was bought by Mirkaei Tikshoret, a diversified Israeli media firm controlled by investor Eli Azur (who in 2014 also acquired the newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot;). &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; is published in English. Previously, it also had a French edition.

Originally a left-wing newspaper, it underwent a noticeable shift to the political right in the late 1980s. From 2004 onward, editor David Horovitz moved the paper to the center, and his successor in 2011, Steve Linde, pledged to provide balanced coverage of the news along with views from across the political spectrum. In April 2016, Linde stepped down as editor-in-chief and was replaced by Yaakov Katz, a former military reporter for the paper who previously served as an adviser to former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

In March 2023, Katz stepped down as editor-in-chief and was replaced by Avi Mayer. Nine months later, Mayer was replaced by Zvika Klein.

The paper professes to be in the Israeli political center, yet is considered to be on the political center-right; its editorial line is critical of political corruption, and supportive of the separation of religion and state in Israel. It is also a strong proponent of greater investment by the State of Israel in World Jewry and educational programs for the Jewish diaspora.

==History==
===1925–1950===
The first attempt to establish an English-language newspaper in Jerusalem was &quot;The Jerusalem News&quot;, established in 1919 under the auspices of the Christian Science movement, but this had no relationship to &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. The direct journalistic ancestry of &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; can be traced to &quot;The Palestine Bulletin&quot;, which was founded in January 1925 by Jacob Landau of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. It was owned by the Palestine Telegraphic Agency, which was in practice part of the JTA even though it was legally separate.

On 1 November 1931, editorship of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; was taken over by Gershon Agronsky (later Agron), a Jewish journalist who had immigrated to Palestine from the United States. In March 1932, a dispute arose between Landau and Agronsky, which Agronsky resolved to settle by establishing an independent newspaper. Landau and Agronsky instead came to an agreement to transform the &quot;Bulletin&quot; into a new, jointly owned newspaper. Accordingly, the &quot;Palestine Bulletin&quot; published its last issue on 30 November 1932 and &quot;The Palestine Post Incorporating The Palestine Bulletin&quot; appeared the following day, 1 December 1932. On 25 April 1933, the masthead was reduced to just &quot;The Palestine Post&quot; although its founding year still appeared as 1925. It appeared on 24 August 1934 but not in the following issue, 26 August, or later.
During its time as &quot;The Palestine Post&quot;, the publication supported the struggle for a Jewish homeland in Palestine and openly opposed British policy restricting Jewish immigration during the Mandate period. According to one commentator, &quot;Zionist institutions considered the newspaper one of the most effective means of exerting influence on the British authorities.&quot;

====1948 bombing====
On the evening of 1 February 1948, a stolen British police car loaded with half a ton of TNT pulled up in front of the Jerusalem office of the &quot;Palestine Post&quot;; the driver of a second car arrived a few minutes later, lit the fuse and drove off. The building also contained other newspaper offices, the British press censor, the Jewish settlement police, and a Haganah post with a cache of weapons. Arab leader Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni claimed responsibility for the bombing, but historian Uri Milstein reported that the bomb had been prepared by the Nazi-trained Fawzi el-Kutub, known as &quot;the engineer&quot;, with the involvement of two British army deserters, Cpl. Peter Mersden and Capt. Eddie Brown. Four people were killed in the bombing, including three &quot;Post&quot; employees. According to the Palestine Post at the time, a newspaper typesetter and two people who lived in a nearby block of flats died. Dozens of others were injured and the printing press was destroyed. The morning paper came out in a reduced format of two pages, printed at a small print shop nearby.
===1950–present===
In 1950, two years after the State of Israel was declared, the paper was renamed &quot;The Jerusalem Post.&quot;

The broadsheet newspaper is published daily Sunday to Friday, except for Jewish religious holidays and Independence Day, with no edition appearing on Saturday (the Jewish Sabbath). Regular opinion columnists write on subjects such as religion, foreign affairs and economics. the owner of the paper is Eli Azur, editor-in-chief is Yaakov Katz and the managing editor is David Brinn.

In January 2008, the paper announced a new partnership with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, including joint marketing and exclusive publication in Israel of &quot;The Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;.

&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; also publishes a monthly magazine, &quot;IVRIT,&quot; edited by Sarit Yalov. Its target audience is people learning the Hebrew language and it is described as &quot;an easy-Hebrew&quot; publication, meant for improving basic Hebrew reading skills. It uses the vowel notation system to make comprehension of the Hebrew abjad simpler. &quot;The Jerusalem Report&quot;, now edited by Steve Linde, is a print and online glossy newsmagazine.

Since 2012, the newspaper has held an annual conference in New York, The Jerusalem Post Conference, with the participation of senior figures in the Israeli government and the Jewish world. The conference was founded by the media entrepreneur Ronen Lefler, and is currently managed by the CEO of the Jerusalem Post Group, Inbar Ashkenazi.

In 2020, Reuters reported that &quot;The&quot; &quot;Jerusalem Post,&quot; along with Algemeiner, The Times of Israel and Arutz Sheva, had published op-eds written by non-existent people. In 2020, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; identified a network of false personas used to sneak opinion pieces aligned with UAE government policy to media outlets such as &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;. Twitter suspended some of the accounts of these fake persons on its own platform.

In January 2022, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&#x27;s&quot; website was hacked by pro-Iranian actors. The &quot;JPost.com&quot; website homepage was replaced with an image depicting a bullet shot from a red ring on a finger (likely in reference to the ring worn by the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani) and the caption &quot;we are close to you where you do not think about it&quot;. The hack occurred on the second anniversary of the Assassination of Qasem Soleimani and is largely seen as a threat towards Israel.

&quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; has been publishing an annual list of the world&#x27;s &quot;50 most influential Jews&quot; since 2010. The list is released on Rosh Hashanah. In 2023, The Jerusalem Post announced the launch of a &quot;50 most influential Jews&quot; congress, including an awards ceremony for the honorees.

==Ownership changes==
Until 1989, the paper supported the Labor Party. In 1989, the paper was purchased by Hollinger Inc., owned by Conrad Black. A number of journalists resigned from the Post after Black&#x27;s takeover and founded &quot;The Jerusalem Report&quot;, a weekly magazine eventually sold to the &quot;Post&quot;.

Under editor-in-chief David Makovsky, from 1999 to 2000, the paper took a centrist position on defense, but began to reject socialism. In 2002, Hollinger hired the politically conservative Bret Stephens of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as editor-in-chief. David Horovitz took over as editor-in-chief on 1 October 2004. On 16 November 2004, Hollinger sold the paper to Mirkaei Tikshoret Limited, a Tel Aviv-based publisher of Israeli newspapers. CanWest Global Communications, Canada&#x27;s biggest media concern, had announced an agreement to take a 50 percent stake in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; after Mirkaei bought the property, but the deal soured. The two sides went to arbitration, and CanWest lost.

In 2011, Horovitz was succeeded by the paper&#x27;s managing editor, Steve Linde, who professed to maintain political moderation and balance. Yaakov Katz, the paper&#x27;s former military analyst and a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism, succeeded Linde in April 2016.

==Websites==
===JPost.com===
&quot;JPost.com&quot; was launched in December 1996. Its current version also contains an ePaper version of the daily newspaper, a range of magazines and other web versions of the Group&#x27;s products.

The site is an entity separate from the daily newspaper. While sharing reporters, it is managed by different teams. Its staff is based in Tel Aviv, while the newspaper offices are located in Jerusalem.

The site contains archives that go back to 1989, and the default search on the site sends users to archive listings, powered by ProQuest, where articles can be purchased. Free blurbs of the article are available as well, and full articles are available when linked to directly from navigation within JPost.com or from a search engine.

JPost.com includes the &quot;Premium Zone&quot;, a pay-wall protected area, containing additional Jerusalem Post articles and special features. The site, which was given a graphic facelift in September 2014, recently relaunched its mobile and tablet applications, as well as its special edition for mobile viewing.

==Agron family==
Gershon Agron founded the newspaper and served as its editor until he went into public service. One of his early reporters was his nephew Martin Agronsky, who later became a famous American political journalist. Agronsky left the paper after only a year. He felt he had been hired out of nepotism and didn&#x27;t like this, wanting to earn his jobs.

Agron&#x27;s son Dani Agron worked for the newspaper, serving as its business manager in the 1970s, while his wife Ethel wrote for &quot;Hadassah Magazine&quot;. Martin Agronsky&#x27;s son Jonathan Agronsky became a journalist in the United States.

<text>Winterberg (Westphalian: &quot;Winnenmerg&quot;) is a town in the Hochsauerland district of North Rhine-Westphalia, central Germany and a major winter sport resort of the Wintersport Arena Sauerland.

==Geography==
Winterberg is located in the middle of the Sauerland, at the source of the Ruhr and Lenne rivers.

===Neighbouring municipalities===
* Bad Berleburg
* Hallenberg 
* Medebach
* Olsberg
* Schmallenberg

===Division of the town===
After the local government reforms of 1975 Winterberg consists of 15 districts:

* Altastenberg
* Altenfeld
* Elkeringhausen
* Grönebach
* Hildfeld
* Hoheleye
* Langewiese
* Lenneplätze
* Mollseifen
* Neuastenberg
* Niedersfeld
* Siedlinghausen
* Silbach
* Winterberg
* Züschen
== Climate ==
Winterberg experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) like most of Germany, however also bordering on subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), thanks to its altitude, with only having an average temperature above 10 °C and September only being barely above it. The summers are short and cool, while the winters are cold, but warmer than winters in the Alps or in the Ore Mountains. The growing season nonethless lasts for only 100 days.

Depending on the definition the climate can also described as oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;).

==History ==

=== Town Origin ===
Winterberg was declared a city by Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden (1238-’61) about 1270. The foundation of the city of Winterberg was presumably carried out together with the cloister in Küstelberg. Here indicates a document of 1276 in which the rights are regulated in the town between archbishop and cloister. In this document a church is mentioned in Winterberg whose precursor presumably goes back till the time about 1225. 
The city fortification seems to have granted in the 14th century first only very much restricted protection. The count von Waldeck conquered the town 1321. About 1357 Winterberg became destroyed by Gottfried IV. von Arnsberg during his war with the Cologne archbishop Wilhelm von Gennep. For the reconstruction the archbishop granted an at first ten-year-old tax freedom. This was extended in 1370 and 1374 in each case by other five years. At this time Winterberg owned the same town right like Hallenberg.
Winterberg was a member of the Hanseatic League from the 13th until the 17th century. The town was in the middle of two trade roads, Heidenstrasse between Cologne and Kassel and Heerstrasse between Frankfurt am Main and Soest. The bad agricultural conditions led to the fact that trade played a central role as a life basis of the town.

===Deserted Medieval Town===
Between 1350 and 1500 the surrounding settlements of Wernsdorf, Merleheim, Haarfeld, Günninghausen and Elkeringhausen were abandoned by their inhabitants. They often moved to Winterberg while they maintained the possession rights on their land. 
The abandonment of the old settlements is likely related to the plague and also to the frequent feuds and lootings of the time, since bigger towns offered a better protection against enemy troops. Only the cities/towns of Winterberg, Hallenberg, Schmallenberg and Medebach were presumably inhabited at this time. The surrounding areas were most likely left completely deserted.

===Modern times &#x27;til the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1500–1650)===
By the acquisition of region &quot;Marken&quot; the area of Winterberg strongly extended. There were similar trends in neighbouring towns. At the beginning of the 16th century Winterberg expanded her farmland in the area of Astenberg. Thereby they got during conflict with the count of von Waldeck who owned rights in the neighbouring village Nordenau. From southwest her territorial claims overlapped with the county Wittgenstein. This quarrel stretched with both opponents up to the end of the 18th century. In a comparison with Wittgenstein 1783 the debatable area was split.
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War the neighbouring town Medebach and Hallenberg were 1634 destroyed by Hessian troops. Both had to suffer very much from contributions, lootings and murders. Besides, still the plague broke out soon afterwards. Both towns thereby had to register big population losses. This destiny seems to have remained saved to the city of Winterberg to a great extent. An important clue for this is that in 1638/39 the town council could buy a new organ for 240 imperial talers. Vice versa this could be the trigger for a vain siege of the town about 1640. The Winterberger shooters repulsed therefore attacking Hessen and Sweden successfully.

===Witch hunts===
As in many other places in the Duchy of Westphalia, between the 16th and 18th centuries, witch trials and executions took place in Winterberg. The exact number is unknown because the source material is extremely poor. Documented witch trials took place in 1523, probably 1562, 1629 and possibly 1728. On November 19, 1993, at the site of the &quot;Winterberger Halsgerichts&quot; a monument was opened as a memorial to the victims of the 16th century witch hunts.

==Points of interest==
The second highest mountain of the Sauerland, the &quot;Kahler Asten&quot; in the Rothaargebirge, is located in the city area, which also contains the spring of the Lenne and Ruhr rivers.

==Sport==
The city is one of the winter sports centers of the Sauerland, best known probably for the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track. In 2003, there were the first official World Wok Championships, initiated by Stefan Raab.

==Coat of arms==
The arms show the city (the city walls only existed between 1261 and 1266) behind the patron of the city, Saint James, as Winterberg is located on one of the Ways of St. James.

==International relations==
Winterberg is twinned with:
* Le Touquet (France) -- since 1974
* Rijssen - Holten (Netherlands) -- since 1974
* Rixensart (Belgium) -- since 1989
* Oberhof (Germany) -- since 1990
* Sölden (Austria) -- since 2018
* Holmenkollen (Norway) -- since 2018
* Bariloche (Argentina) -- since 2018

<text>Amanita phalloides (), commonly known as the death cap, is a deadly poisonous basidiomycete fungus and mushroom, one of many in the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;. Originating in Europe but later introduced to other parts of the world since the late twentieth century, &quot;A. phalloides&quot; forms ectomycorrhizas with various broadleaved trees. In some cases, the death cap has been introduced to new regions with the cultivation of non-native species of oak, chestnut, and pine. The large fruiting bodies (mushrooms) appear in summer and autumn; the caps are generally greenish in colour with a white stipe and gills. The cap colour is variable, including white forms, and is thus not a reliable identifier.

These toxic mushrooms resemble several edible species (most notably Caesar&#x27;s mushroom and the straw mushroom) commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental poisoning. Amatoxins, the class of toxins found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat, so their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking.

&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; is the most poisonous of all known mushrooms. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It is also the deadliest mushroom worldwide, responsible for 90% of mushroom-related fatalities every year. It has been involved in the majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has also been the subject of much research and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-Amanitin, which causes liver and kidney failure.

==Taxonomy==
The death cap is named in Latin as such in the correspondence between the English physician Thomas Browne and Christopher Merrett. Also, it was described by French botanist Sébastien Vaillant in 1727, who gave a succinct phrase name &quot;Fungus phalloides, annulatus, sordide virescens, et patulus&quot;—a recognizable name for the fungus today. Though the scientific name &quot;phalloides&quot; means &quot;phallus-shaped&quot;, it is unclear whether it is named for its resemblance to a literal phallus or the stinkhorn mushrooms &quot;Phallus&quot;.
In 1821, Elias Magnus Fries described it as &quot;Agaricus phalloides&quot;, but included all white amanitas within its description. Finally, in 1833, Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link settled on the name &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;, after Persoon had named it &quot;Amanita viridis&quot; 30 years earlier. Although Louis Secretan&#x27;s use of the name &quot;A. phalloides&quot; predates Link&#x27;s, it has been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan&#x27;s works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently; some taxonomists have, however, disagreed with this opinion.

&quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; is the type species of &quot;Amanita&quot; section Phalloideae, a group that contains all of the deadly poisonous &quot;Amanita&quot; species thus far identified. Most notable of these are the species known as destroying angels, namely &quot;A. virosa&quot;, &quot;A. bisporigera&quot; and &quot;A. ocreata&quot;, as well as the fool&#x27;s mushroom &quot;(A. verna)&quot;. The term &quot;destroying angel&quot; has been applied to &quot;A. phalloides&quot; at times, but &quot;death cap&quot; is by far the most common vernacular name used in English. Other common names also listed include &quot;stinking amanita&quot; and &quot;deadly amanita&quot;.

A rarely appearing, all-white form was initially described &quot;A. phalloides&quot; f. &quot;alba&quot; by Max Britzelmayr, though its status has been unclear. It is often found growing amid normally colored death caps. It has been described, in 2004, as a distinct variety and includes what was termed &quot;A. verna&quot; var. &quot;tarda&quot;. The true &quot;A. verna&quot; fruits in spring and turns yellow with KOH solution, whereas &quot;A. phalloides&quot; never does.

==Description==

The death cap has a large and imposing epigeous (aboveground) fruiting body (basidiocarp), usually with a pileus (cap) from across, initially rounded and hemispherical, but flattening with age. The color of the cap can be pale-green, yellowish-green, olive-green, bronze, or (in one form) white; it is often paler toward the margins, which can have darker streaks; it is also often paler after rain. The cap surface is sticky when wet and easily peeled—a troublesome feature, as that is allegedly a feature of edible fungi. The remains of the partial veil are seen as a skirtlike, floppy annulus usually about below the cap. The crowded white lamellae (gills) are free. The stipe is white with a scattering of grayish-olive scales and is long and thick, with a swollen, ragged, sac-like white volva (base). As the volva, which may be hidden by leaf litter, is a distinctive and diagnostic feature, it is important to remove some debris to check for it. Spores: 7-12 x 6-9 μm. Smooth, ellipsoid, amyloid.

The smell has been described as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over time to become overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of &quot;Amanita&quot;. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10 μm (0.3–0.4 mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.

===Biochemistry===

The species is now known to contain two main groups of toxins, both multicyclic (ring-shaped) peptides, spread throughout the mushroom and d cell–destroying activity &quot;in vitro&quot;. An unrelated compound, antamanide, has also been isolated.

Amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by Heinrich O. Wieland and Rudolf Hallermayer of the University of Munich. Of the amatoxins, α-Amanitin is the chief component and along with β-amanitin is likely responsible for the toxic effects. Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism grind to a halt and the cell dies. The liver is the principal organ affected, as it is the organ which is first encountered after absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, though other organs, especially the kidneys, are susceptible. The RNA polymerase of &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot; is insensitive to the effects of amatoxins, so the mushroom does not poison itself.

The phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds, all of which have seven similar peptide rings. Phalloidin was isolated in 1937 by Feodor Lynen, Heinrich Wieland&#x27;s student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells, they have since been found to add little to the death cap&#x27;s toxicity, as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible (and sought-after) blusher (&quot;A. rubescens&quot;). Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides. Like the phallotoxins, they do not induce any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.

The genome of the death cap has been sequenced.

===Similarity to edible species===
&quot;A. phalloides&quot; is similar to the edible paddy straw mushroom (&quot;Volvariella volvacea&quot;) and &quot;A. princeps&quot;, commonly known as &quot;white Caesar&quot;.

Some may mistake juvenile death caps for edible puffballs or mature specimens for other edible &quot;Amanita&quot; species, such as &quot;A. lanei&quot;, so some authorities recommend avoiding the collecting of &quot;Amanita&quot; species for the table altogether. The white form of &quot;A. phalloides&quot; may be mistaken for edible species of &quot;Agaricus&quot;, especially the young fruitbodies whose unexpanded caps conceal the telltale white gills; all mature species of &quot;Agaricus&quot; have dark-colored gills.

In Europe, other similarly green-capped species collected by mushroom hunters include various green-hued brittlegills of the genus &quot;Russula&quot; and the formerly popular &quot;Tricholoma equestre&quot;, now regarded as hazardous owing to a series of restaurant poisonings in France. Brittlegills, such as &quot;Russula heterophylla&quot;, &quot;R. aeruginea&quot;, and &quot;R. virescens&quot;, can be distinguished by their brittle flesh and the lack of both volva and ring. Other similar species include &quot;A. subjunquillea&quot; in eastern Asia and &quot;A. arocheae&quot;, which ranges from Andean Colombia north at least as far as central Mexico, both of which are also poisonous.

==Distribution and habitat==

The death cap is native to Europe, where it is widespread. It is found from the southern coastal regions of Scandinavia in the north, to Ireland in the west, east to Poland and western Russia, and south throughout the Balkans, in Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal in the Mediterranean basin, and in Morocco and Algeria in north Africa. In west Asia, it has been reported from forests of northern Iran. There are records from further east in Asia but these have yet to be confirmed as &quot;A. phalloides&quot;.

By the end of the 19th century, Charles Horton Peck had reported &quot;A. phalloides&quot; in North America. In 1918, samples from the eastern United States were identified as being a distinct though similar species, &quot;A. brunnescens&quot;, by George Francis Atkinson of Cornell University. By the 1970s, it had become clear that &quot;A. phalloides&quot; does occur in the United States, apparently having been introduced from Europe alongside chestnuts, with populations on the West and East Coasts. A 2006 historical review concluded the East Coast populations were inadvertently introduced, likely on the roots of other purposely imported plants such as chestnuts. The origins of the West Coast populations remained unclear, due to scant historical records, but a 2009 genetic study provided strong evidence for the introduced status of the fungus on the west coast of North America. Observations of various collections of &quot;A. phalloides&quot;, from conifers rather than native forests, have led to the hypothesis that the species was introduced to North America multiple times. It is hypothesized that the various introductions led to multiple genotypes which are adapted to either oaks or conifers.

&quot;A. phalloides&quot; were conveyed to new countries across the Southern Hemisphere with the importation of hardwoods and conifers in the late twentieth century. Introduced oaks appear to have been the vector to Australia and South America; populations under oaks have been recorded from Melbourne, Canberra (where two people died in January 2012, of four who were poisoned), Adelaide, and further observed by citizen scientists in Beechworth, Sydney and Albury.
It has been recorded under other introduced trees in Argentina. Pine plantations are associated with the fungus in Tanzania and South Africa, found under oaks and poplars in Chile, as well as Uruguay. 
A number of deaths in India have been attributed to it.

==Ecology==
It is ectomycorrhizally associated with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, &quot;A. phalloides&quot; may also be associated with these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, &quot;A. phalloides&quot; is associated with coast live oak, but not with the various coastal pine species, such as Monterey pine. In countries where it has been introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range. There is, however, evidence of &quot;A. phalloides&quot; associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; in Tanzania and Algeria, and &quot;Leptospermum&quot; and &quot;Kunzea&quot; in New Zealand, suggesting that the species may have invasive potential. It may have also been anthropogenically introduced to the island of Cyprus, where it has been documented to fruit within &quot;Corylus avellana&quot; plantations.

==Toxicity==
As the common name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is responsible for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. On average, one person dies a year in North America from death cap ingestion. The toxins of the death cap mushrooms primarily target the liver, but other organs, such as the kidneys, are also affected. Symptoms of death cap mushroom toxicity usually occur 6 to 12 hours after ingestion. Symptoms of ingestion of the death cap mushroom may include nausea and vomiting, which is then followed by jaundice, seizures, and coma which will lead to death. The mortality rate of ingestion of the death cap mushroom is believed to be around 10–30%.

Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.

Poisoning incidents usually result from errors in identification. Recent cases highlight the issue of the similarity of &quot;A. phalloides&quot; to the edible paddy straw mushroom (&quot;Volvariella volvacea&quot;), with East- and Southeast-Asian immigrants in Australia and the West Coast of the U.S. falling victim. In an episode in Oregon, four members of a Korean family required liver transplants. Many North American incidents of death cap poisoning have occurred among Laotian and Hmong immigrants, since it is easily confused with &quot;A. princeps&quot; (&quot;white Caesar&quot;), a popular mushroom in their native countries. Of the 9 people poisoned in Australia&#x27;s Canberra region between 1988 and 2011, three were from Laos and two were from China. In January 2012, four people were accidentally poisoned when death caps (reportedly misidentified as straw mushrooms, which are popular in Chinese and other Asian dishes) were served for dinner in Canberra; all the victims required hospital treatment and two of them died, with a third requiring a liver transplant.

===Signs and symptoms===
Death caps have been reported to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes them particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include increased intracranial pressure, intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning. 

It is noticed that after up to 24 hours have passed, the symptoms seem to disappear and the person might feel fine for up to 72 hours. Symptoms of liver and kidney damage start 3 to 6 days after the mushrooms were eaten, with the considerable increase of the transaminases.

Mushroom poisoning is more common in Europe than in North America. Up to the mid-20th century, the mortality rate was around 60–70%, but this has been greatly reduced with advances in medical care. A review of death cap poisoning throughout Europe from 1971 to 1980 found the overall mortality rate to be 22.4% (51.3% in children under ten and 16.5% in those older than ten). This was revised to around 10–15% in surveys reviewed in 1995.

===Treatment===
Consumption of the death cap is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization. The four main categories of therapy for poisoning are preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and liver transplantation.

Preliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage; due to the delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is common for patients to arrive for treatment many hours after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.

No definitive antidote is available, but some specific treatments have been shown to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (&quot;Silybum marianum&quot;), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.

SLCO1B3 has been identified as the human hepatic uptake transporter for amatoxins; moreover, substrates and inhibitors of that protein—among others rifampicin, penicillin, silibinin, antamanide, paclitaxel, ciclosporin and prednisolone—may be useful for the treatment of human amatoxin poisoning.

N-acetylcysteine has shown promise in combination with other therapies. Animal studies indicate the amatoxins deplete hepatic glutathione; N-acetylcysteine serves as a glutathione precursor and may therefore prevent reduced glutathione levels and subsequent liver damage. None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation. Other methods of enhancing the elimination of the toxins have been trialed; techniques such as hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, plasmapheresis, and peritoneal dialysis have occasionally yielded success, but overall do not appear to improve outcome.

In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, up to half of those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.

==Notable victims==
Several historical figures may have died from &quot;A. phalloides&quot; poisoning (or other similar, toxic &quot;Amanita&quot; species). These were either accidental poisonings or assassination plots. Alleged victims of this kind of poisoning include Roman Emperor Claudius, Pope Clement VII, the Russian tsaritsa Natalia Naryshkina, and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI.

R. Gordon Wasson recounted the details of these deaths, noting the likelihood of &quot;Amanita&quot; poisoning. In the case of Clement VII, the illness that led to his death lasted five months, making the case inconsistent with amatoxin poisoning. Natalya Naryshkina is said to have consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.

Charles VI experienced indigestion after eating a dish of sautéed mushrooms. This led to an illness from which he died 10 days later—symptomatology consistent with amatoxin poisoning. His death led to the War of the Austrian Succession. Noted Voltaire, &quot;this mushroom dish has changed the destiny of Europe.&quot;

The case of Claudius&#x27;s poisoning is more complex. Claudius was known to have been very fond of eating Caesar&#x27;s mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar&#x27;s mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness. Other historians have speculated that Claudius may have died of natural causes.

In July 2023, four people in Leongatha, Australia were taken to hospital after consuming a Beef Wellington suspected to have contained &quot;A. phalloides&quot;. Three of the four guests subsequently died, and one survived, later receiving a liver transplant. The woman who cooked the meal, Erin Patterson, was charged with murder in November 2023.

<text>The Philippine–American War, known alternatively as the Philippine Insurrection, Filipino–American War, or Tagalog Insurgency, emerged following the conclusion of the Spanish–American War in December 1898 when the United States annexed the Philippine Islands under the Treaty of Paris. Philippine nationalists constituted the First Philippine Republic in January 1899, seven months after signing the Philippine Declaration of Independence. The United States did not recognize either event as legitimate, and tensions escalated until fighting commenced on February 4, 1899, in the Battle of Manila.

Shortly after being denied a request for an armistice, the Philippine Council of Government issued a proclamation on June 2, 1899, urging the people to continue the war. Philippine forces initially attempted to engage U.S. forces conventionally but transitioned to guerrilla tactics by November 1899. Philippine President Emilio Aguinaldo was captured on March 23, 1901, and the war was officially declared over by the US on July 4, 1902. However, some Philippine groupssome led by veterans of the Katipunan, a Philippine revolutionary society that had launched the revolution against Spaincontinued to fight for several more years. Other groups, including the Muslim Moro peoples of the southern Philippines and quasi-Catholic Pulahan religious movements, continued hostilities in remote areas. The resistance in the Moro-dominated provinces in the south, called the Moro Rebellion by the Americans, ended with their final defeat at the Battle of Bud Bagsak on June 15, 1913.

The war resulted in at least 200,000 Filipino civilian deaths, mostly from famine and diseases such as cholera. Some estimates for civilian deaths reach up to a million. War crimes were committed during the conflict by both sides, including torture, mutilation, and summary executions of civilians and prisoners. In retaliation for Filipino guerrilla warfare tactics, the U.S. carried out reprisals and scorched earth campaigns and forcibly relocated many civilians to concentration camps, where thousands died. The war and subsequent occupation by the U.S. changed the culture of the islands, leading to the rise of Protestantism, disestablishment of the Catholic Church, and the adoption of English by the islands as the primary language of government, education, business, and industry. The U.S. annexation and war sparked a political backlash from anti-imperialists in the U.S. Senate, who argued that the war was a definite example of U.S. imperialism, and that it was an inherent contradiction of the founding principles of the United States contained in the Declaration of Independence.

In 1902, the United States Congress passed the Philippine Organic Act, which provided for the creation of the Philippine Assembly, with members to be elected by Filipino men (women did not yet have the right to vote). This act was superseded by the 1916 Jones Act (Philippine Autonomy Act), which contained the first formal and official declaration of the United States government&#x27;s commitment to eventually grant independence to the Philippines. The 1934 Tydings–McDuffie Act (Philippine Independence Act) created the Commonwealth of the Philippines the following year. The act increased self-governance and established a process towards full independence (originally scheduled for 1944, but delayed by World War II and the Japanese occupation of the Philippines). The United States eventually granted full Philippine independence in 1946 through the Treaty of Manila.

==Background==
===Philippine Revolution===
Andrés Bonifacio was a warehouseman and clerk from Manila. On July 7, 1892, he established the Katipunan, a revolutionary organization formed to gain independence from Spanish colonial rule by armed revolt. In August 1896, the Katipunan was discovered by the Spanish authorities and thus launched its revolution. Fighters in Cavite province won early victories. One of the most influential and popular leaders from Cavite was Emilio Aguinaldo, mayor of Cavite El Viejo (modern-day Kawit), who gained control of much of the eastern portion of Cavite province. Eventually, Aguinaldo and his faction gained control of the revolution. After Aguinaldo was elected president of a revolutionary government superseding the Katipunan at the Tejeros Convention on March 22, 1897, his government had Bonifacio executed for treason after a show trial on May 10, 1897.

===Aguinaldo&#x27;s exile and return===

By late 1897, after a succession of defeats for the revolutionary forces, the Spanish had regained control over most of rebel territory. Aguinaldo and Spanish Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera entered into armistice negotiations while Spanish forces surrounded Aguinaldo&#x27;s hideout and base in Biak-na-Bato in Bulacan province. On December 14, 1897, an agreement was reached in which the Spanish colonial government would pay Aguinaldo $MXN800,000 in three installments if Aguinaldo went into exile outside the Philippines.

Aguinaldo and 25 of his closest associates left their headquarters at Biak-na-Bato and made their way to Hong Kong, in accord with the agreement. Before his departure, Aguinaldo denounced the Philippine Revolution, exhorted rebel combatants to disarm, and declared those who continued hostilities to be bandits. Despite the denunciation, some revolutionaries continued armed resistance against the Spanish colonial government.

On April 22, 1898, the exiled Aguinaldo privately met in Singapore with United States Consul E. Spencer Pratt. Pratt was later severely rebuked for having met with Aguinaldo and told, &quot;Your action was unauthorized and can not be approved&quot;, but the meeting convinced Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines and reclaim leadership of the revolution. Aguinaldo and Pratt each offered contradictory accounts of the meeting.

Aguinaldo returned to Hong Kong and was transported by the Americans to Cavite, arriving on May 19. He established a temporary Dictatorial Government under which the Philippine Declaration of Independence was proclaimed. About a month later, this temporary dictatorship was replaced with a Revolutionary Government that appointed Aguinaldo as President. Less than three months after his return, the Philippine Revolutionary Army established control over nearly all the Philippines Islands with the exception of Manila, which was surrounded by revolutionary forces some 12,000 strong.

The Philippine Declaration of Independence was not recognized by either the United States or Spain, and the Spanish government ceded the Philippines to the United States in the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which was signed on December 10, 1898, in consideration for an indemnity for Spanish expenses and assets lost.

The Malolos Congress drafted a constitution that led to the formal establishment of the Philippine Republic by late January 1899. This government would later become known as the First Philippine Republic and also the Malolos Republic after its capital. Aguinaldo, who had been appointed President by the Malolos Congress on January 1, is today officially considered the first President of the Republic of the Philippines.

==Origins of the conflict==

===Mock Battle of Manila===
In July 1898, three months into the Spanish-American War, U.S. command began suspecting Aguinaldo was secretly negotiating with Spanish authorities to gain control of Manila without U.S. assistance, reporting that the rebel leader was restricting delivery of supplies to U.S. forces. General Thomas M. Anderson assessed that a rebel controlled Manila would be able to resist any U.S. attempt to establish a provisional government. General Wesley Merritt disregarded an Aguinaldo warning not to disembark American troops in places liberated by Filipinos without first informing him in writing about the places and purposes of the actions. U.S. commanders came to suspect that Philippine rebel forces were informing Spanish forces of U.S. troop movements.

U.S. and Spanish commanders negotiated a secret agreement to stage a mock battle in Manila, after which Spanish forces would surrender to U.S. forces. Philippine rebels would not be allowed to enter the city. Fighting between U.S. and Philippine troops almost broke out as the former moved to dislodge the latter from strategic positions around Manila. On the eve of the staged battle, Anderson telegraphed Aguinaldo, &quot;Do not let your troops enter Manila without the permission of the American commander. On this side of the Pasig River you will be under fire.&quot; On August 13, U.S. forces captured Manila. Relations between the U.S. and Philippine rebels continued to deteriorate.

===End of the Spanish–American War===
On August 12, 1898, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that a peace protocol had been signed in Washington that afternoon between the U.S. and Spain, suspending hostilities. The full text of the protocol was not made public until November 5, but Article III read: &quot;The United States will occupy and hold the City, Bay, and Harbor of Manila, pending the conclusion of a treaty of peace, which shall determine the control, disposition, and government of the Philippines.&quot; After conclusion of this agreement, U.S. President William McKinley proclaimed a suspension of hostilities with Spain.

In a clash at Cavite between US soldiers and insurgents on August 25, 1898, George Hudson of the Utah regiment was killed, Corporal William Anderson was mortally wounded, and four troopers of the Fourth Cavalry were slightly wounded. This provoked General Anderson to send Aguinaldo a letter saying, &quot;In order to avoid the very serious misfortune of an encounter between our troops, I demand your immediate withdrawal with your guard from Cavite. One of my men has been killed and three wounded by your people. This is positive and does not admit of explanation or delay.&quot; Internal insurgent communications reported that the Americans were drunk at the time. Halstead writes that Aguinaldo expressed his regret and promised to punish the offenders. In internal insurgent communications, Apolinario Mabini initially proposed to investigate and punish any offenders identified. Aguinaldo modified this, ordering, &quot;... say that he was not killed by your soldiers, but by them themselves [the Americans] since they were drunk according to your telegram&quot;. An insurgent officer in Cavite at the time reported on his record of services that he: &quot;took part in the movement against the Americans on the afternoon of the 24th of August, under the orders of the commander of the troops and the adjutant of the post&quot;.

Elections were held by the Revolutionary Government between June and September 10, seating a legislature known as the Malolos Congress. In a session between September 15 and November 13, 1898, the Malolos Constitution was adopted. It was promulgated on January 21, 1899, creating the First Philippine Republic with Emilio Aguinaldo as president.

Article V of the peace protocol signed on August 12 had mandated negotiations to conclude a treaty of peace to begin in Paris not later than October 1, 1898. President McKinley sent a five-man commission, initially instructed to demand no more than Luzon, Guam, and Puerto Rico; which would have provided a limited U.S. empire. In Paris, the commission was besieged with advice, particularly from American generals and European diplomats, to demand the entire Philippine archipelago. The unanimous recommendation was that &quot;it would certainly be cheaper and more humane to take the entire Philippines than to keep only part of it.&quot; McKinley concluded after much consideration that returning the Philippines to Spain would have been &quot;cowardly and dishonorable,&quot; that turning them over to &quot;commercial rivals&quot; of the United States would have been &quot;bad business and discreditable,&quot; and that the Filipinos &quot;were unfit for self-government.&quot;

On October 28, 1898, McKinley wired the commission that &quot;cessation of Luzon alone, leaving the rest of the islands subject to Spanish rule, or to be the subject of future contention, cannot be justified on political, commercial, or humanitarian grounds. The cessation must be the whole archipelago or none. The latter is wholly inadmissible, and the former must therefore be required.&quot; The Spanish negotiators were furious over the &quot;immodist demands of a conqueror&quot;, but their wounded pride was assuaged by an offer of twenty million dollars for &quot;Spanish improvements&quot; to the islands. The Spaniards capitulated, and on December 10, 1898, the U.S. and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, formally ending the Spanish–American War. In Article III, Spain ceded the Philippine archipelago to the United States, as follows: &quot;Spain cedes to the United States the archipelago known as the Philippine Islands, and comprehending the islands lying within the following line: [... geographic description elided ...]. The United States will pay to Spain the sum of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000) within three months after the exchange of the ratifications of the present treaty.&quot;

The U.S. experienced a movement for Philippine independence; some said that the U.S. had no right to a land where many of the people wanted self-government. In 1898, industrialist Andrew Carnegie offered to pay the U.S. government $20 million to give the Philippines its independence.

===Benevolent assimilation===
On December 21, 1898, McKinley issued a proclamation of &quot;benevolent assimilation, substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary rule&quot; for &quot;the greatest good of the governed&quot;. Referring to the Treaty of Paris, it said that &quot;as a result of the victories of American arms, the future control, disposition, and government of the Philippine Islands are ceded to the United States.&quot; It enjoined military commander Major General Elwell Stephen Otis to inform Filipinos that &quot;in succeeding to the sovereignty of Spain&quot; the authority of the United States &quot;is to be exerted for the securing of the persons and property of the people of the islands and for the confirmation of all their private rights and relations&quot;. The proclamation specified that &quot;it will be the duty of the commander of the forces of occupation to announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come, not as invaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and religious rights&quot;.

The Spaniards yielded Iloilo to the insurgents on December 26. An American brigade under General Marcus P. Miller arrived on December 28 and opened communications with the insurgents. A Filipino official styling himself &quot;Presidente Lopez of the Federal Government of the Visayas&quot;, stated landing required &quot;express orders from the central government of Luzon&quot; and refused permission to land. That news reached Washington on January 1, 1899.

Otis, who had been appointed Military Governor of the Philippines, had delayed publication of McKinley&#x27;s proclamation. On January 4, Otis published an amended version edited so as not to convey the meanings of the terms &quot;sovereignty&quot;, &quot;protection&quot;, and &quot;right of cessation&quot;, which were present in the original version. On January 6, 1899, General Otis was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as stating &quot;convinced that the U.S. government intends to seek the establishment of a liberal government, in which the people will be as fully represented as the maintenance of law and order will permit, susceptible of development, on lines of increased representation, and the bestowal of increased powers, into a government as free and independent as is enjoyed by the most favored provinces in the world.&quot;

Unknown to Otis, the War Department had sent an enciphered copy of the Benevolent Assimilation proclamation to General Miller for informational purposes. Miller assumed that it was for distribution and, unaware that a politically bowdlerized version had been published by Otis, published the original in both Spanish and Tagalog translations which eventually made their way to Aguinaldo. Even before Aguinaldo received the unaltered version and observed the changes in the copy he had received from Otis, he was upset that Otis had altered his own title to &quot;Military Governor of the Philippines&quot; from &quot;... &quot;in&quot; the Philippines&quot;, a change that Otis had made without authorization.

The original proclamation was given by supporters to Aguinaldo who, on January 5, issued a counter-proclamation:
After some copies of that proclamation had been distributed, Aguinaldo ordered the recall of undistributed copies and issued another proclamation, which was published the same day in &quot;El Heraldo de la Revolucion&quot;, the official newspaper of the Philippine Republic. His statement in part said:
Otis, taking these two proclamations as tantamount to war, strengthened American observation posts and alerted his troops. Aguinaldo&#x27;s proclamations energized the masses with a vigorous determination to fight what was perceived as an ally turned enemy. Some 40,000 Filipinos fled Manila within a period of 15 days.

Meanwhile, Felipe Agoncillo, who had been commissioned by the Philippine Revolutionary Government as Minister Plenipotentiary to negotiate treaties with foreign governments, and who had unsuccessfully sought to be seated at the negotiations between the U.S. and Spain in Paris, had traveled to Washington. On January 6, he filed a request for an interview with the President to discuss affairs in the Philippines. The next day the government officials were surprised to learn that messages to General Otis to deal mildly with the rebels and not to force a conflict had become known to Agoncillo, and cabled by him to Aguinaldo.

On January 8, Agoncillo stated:
The Filipino committees in London, Paris, and Madrid about this time telegraphed to President McKinley:
On January 8, Aguinaldo received the following message from Teodoro Sandiko:
The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on January 8, that two Americans who had been guarding a waterboat in Iloilo had been attacked, one fatally, and that insurgents were threatening to destroy the business section of the city by fire; and on January 10 that a peaceful solution to the Iloilo issues may result but that Aguinaldo had issued a proclamation threatening to drive the Americans from the islands.

By January 10, insurgents were ready to take the offensive, but wanted to provoke the Americans into firing the first shot. They increased their hostile demonstrations and entered forbidden territory. Their attitude is illustrated by an extract from a telegram sent by Colonel Cailles to Aguinaldo on January 10, 1899:
Aguinaldo approved the hostile attitude of Cailles, replying:
==War==
===Path to war===
The First Philippine Republic was declared on January 21, 1899. Lack of recognition by the United States led to rising tensions and, eventually, to hostilities. On January 31, 1899, the Minister of Interior of the Republic, Teodoro Sandiko, signed a decree saying that President Aguinaldo had directed that all idle lands be planted to provide food, in view of impending war with the Americans.

On the evening of February 4, Private William W. Grayson fired the war&#x27;s first shots at the corner of Sociego Street and Tomas Arguelles Street. A study done by Ronnie Miravite Casalmir places the event at this corner, not at Sociego-Silencio where they erroneously have the marker.

According the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, two unarmed soldiers were killed. According to Grayson&#x27;s account, his patrol ordered four Filipino soldiers to &quot;Halt!&quot; and, when the men responded by cocking their rifles, they fired on them and then retreated. The outbreak of violence triggered the 1899 Battle of Manila. Later that day, Aguinaldo declared &quot;That peace and friendly relations with the Americans be broken and that the latter be treated as enemies, within the limits prescribed by the laws of war.&quot;
The following day, Filipino General Isidoro Torres came through the lines under a flag of truce to deliver a message from Aguinaldo to General Otis that the fighting had begun accidentally, and that Aguinaldo wished for the hostilities to cease immediately and for the establishment of a neutral zone. Otis dismissed these overtures, and replied that the &quot;fighting, having begun, must go on to the grim end&quot;. On February 5, General Arthur MacArthur ordered his troops to advance against Filipino troops.
In the U.S., President McKinley had created a commission chaired by Jacob Gould Schurman on January 20 and tasked it to study the situation in the Philippines and make recommendations on how the U.S. should proceed. Members included General Otis and two other civilian appointees. The three civilian members of the commission arrived in Manila on March 4, 1899, a month after hostilities began.

General Otis viewed the arrival of his fellow commission members as an intrusion and boycotted commission meetings. The civilian members of the commission spent a month meeting with Ilustrados who had deserted Aguinaldo&#x27;s Malolos Republic government and studying the Malolos Constitution and other documents of Aguinaldo&#x27;s revolutionary government. Meanwhile, with U.S. forces advancing northwards from Manila, the seat of Aguinaldo&#x27;s revolutionary government had been moved from Malolos to San Isidro, Nueva Ecija. When Malolos fell at the end of March, it moved further north to San Fernando, Pampanga.

The commission published a proclamation containing assurances that the U.S. did not intend exploitation of Filipinos, but their &quot;advancement to a position among the most civilized peoples of the world&quot;, and announced &quot;that the United States is ... anxious to establish in the Philippine Islands an enlightened system of government under which the Philippine people may enjoy the largest measure of home rule and the amplest liberty.&quot;

Though not authorized to discuss an armistice, civilian commission members held informal discussions with a representative of Aguinaldo. Progress on a path without war ended after General Luna arrested Aguinaldo&#x27;s then-cabinet and replaced it with a more hawkish one headed by Apolinario Mabini. On June 2, 1899, the First Philippine Republic declared war on the United States.

===American strategy===
American annexation was justified in the name of liberating and protecting the peoples in the former Spanish colonies. Senator Albert J. Beveridge, a prominent American imperialist, said: &quot;Americans altruistically went to war with Spain to liberate Cubans, Puerto Ricans, and Filipinos from their tyrannical yoke. If they lingered on too long in the Philippines, it was to protect the Filipinos from European predators waiting in the wings for an American withdrawal and to tutor them in American-style democracy.&quot;

On February 11, 1899, one week after the first shots were fired, Iloilo was bombarded by American naval forces from the and the . Filipino forces lit the town on fire before retreating. The city was captured by ground forces led by Brigadier General Marcus Miller, with no loss of American lives. 25 to 30 Filipinos were wounded. The &quot;native&quot; part of the city was almost entirely destroyed.

Months later, after finally securing Manila, American forces moved northward, engaging in combat at the brigade and battalion level in pursuit of the fleeing insurgent forces. In response to the use of guerrilla warfare tactics by Filipino forces, beginning in September 1899, American military strategy shifted to suppression of the resistance. Tactics became focused on the control of key areas with internment and segregation of the civilian population in &quot;zones of protection&quot; from the guerrillas. Many of the interned civilians died from dysentery.

General Otis gained notoriety for some of his actions. Although his superiors had directed Otis to avoid military conflict, he did little to prevent war. Otis refused to accept anything but unconditional surrender from the Philippine Army. He often made major military decisions without first consulting Washington. He acted aggressively in dealing with the Filipinos under the assumption that their resistance would collapse quickly. Even after this assumption proved false, he continued to insist that the insurgency had been defeated, and that the remaining casualties were caused by &quot;isolated bands of outlaws&quot;.

Otis was also active in suppressing information about American military tactics. When letters describing American atrocities reached the American media, Otis had each press clipping forwarded to the original writer&#x27;s commanding officer, who would convince or force the soldier to retract his statements.

===Filipino strategy===
Estimates of the Filipino forces vary between 80,000 and 100,000, with tens of thousands of auxiliaries. Most of the forces were armed only with bolo knives, bows and arrows, spears, and other primitive weapons, which were vastly inferior to the guns and other weapons of the American forces.

A fairly rigid indigenous caste system existed in the Philippines before the Spanish colonial era, which partially survived among the natives during Spanish rule. The goal, or end-state, sought by the First Philippine Republic was a sovereign, independent, stable nation led by an oligarchy composed of members of the educated class (known as the &quot;ilustrado&quot; class). Local chieftains, landowners, businessmen, and &quot;cabezas de barangay&quot; were the &quot;principales&quot; who controlled local politics. The war was at its peak when &quot;ilustrados&quot;, &quot;principales&quot;, and peasants were unified in opposition to annexation by the United States. The peasants, who represented the majority of the fighting forces, had interests different from their &quot;ilustrado&quot; leaders and the &quot;principales&quot; of their villages. Coupled with the ethnic and geographic fragmentation, aligning the interests of people from different social castes was a daunting task. The challenge for Aguinaldo and his generals was to sustain unified Filipino public opposition; this was the revolutionaries&#x27; strategic center of gravity.

The Filipino operational center of gravity was the ability to sustain its force of 100,000 irregulars in the field. The Filipino general Francisco Macabulos described the Filipinos&#x27; war aim as, &quot;not to vanquish the U.S. Army but to inflict on them constant losses&quot;. In the early stages of the war, the Philippine Revolutionary Army employed the conventional military tactics typical of an organized armed resistance. The hope was to inflict enough American casualties to result in McKinley&#x27;s defeat by William Jennings Bryan in the 1900 presidential election. They hoped that Bryan, who held strong anti-imperialist views, would withdraw the American forces from the Philippines.

McKinley&#x27;s election victory in 1900 was demoralizing for the insurgents, and convinced many Filipinos that the United States would not depart quickly. Coupled with a series of devastating losses on the battlefield against American forces equipped with superior technology and training, Aguinaldo became convinced that he needed to change his approach. Beginning on September 14, 1899, Aguinaldo accepted the advice of General Gregorio del Pilar and authorized the use of guerrilla warfare tactics in subsequent military operations in Bulacan.

===Guerrilla war phase===
For most of 1899, the revolutionary leadership had viewed guerrilla warfare strategically only as a tactical option of final recourse, not as a means of operation which better suited their disadvantaged situation. On November 13, 1899, Aguinaldo decreed that guerrilla warfare would henceforth be the strategy. This made American occupation of the Philippine archipelago all the more difficult over the next few years. During the first four months of the guerrilla war, the Americans had nearly 500 casualties. The Philippine Army began staging bloody ambushes and raids, such as the guerrilla victories at Paye, Catubig, Makahambus Hill, Pulang Lupa, and Mabitac. At first, it seemed that the Filipinos might be able to fight the Americans to a stalemate and force them to withdraw. President McKinley considered withdrawal when the guerrilla raids began.

===Martial law===
On December 20, 1900, MacArthur, who had succeeded Elwell Otis as U.S. Military Governor on May 5, placed the Philippines under martial law, invoking U.S. Army General Order 100. He announced that guerrilla abuses would no longer be tolerated and outlined the rights which would govern the U.S. Army&#x27;s treatment of guerrillas and civilians. In particular, guerrillas who wore no uniform but peasant dress and shifted from civilian to military status would be held accountable; secret committees that collected revolutionary taxes and those accepting U.S. protection in occupied towns while assisting guerrillas would be treated as &quot;war rebels or war traitors&quot;. Filipino leaders who continued to work towards Philippine independence were deported to Guam.

===Decline and fall of the First Philippine Republic===

The Philippine Army continued suffering defeats from the better armed United States Army during the conventional warfare phase, forcing Aguinaldo to continually change his base of operations throughout the course of the war.

On June 24, 1900, MacArthur as U.S. Military Governor published a proclamation offering full and complete amnesty to all insurgents who surrendered within ninety days.

On August 3, 1900, Aguinaldo issued a decree urging a continuation of the war and offering rewards for rifles and ammunition brought in by prisoners or deserters from opposing forces.


On March 23, 1901, General Frederick Funston and his troops captured Aguinaldo in Palanan, Isabela, with the help of some Filipinos (called the Macabebe Scouts after their home locale) who had joined the Americans. The Americans pretended to be captives of the Scouts, who were dressed in Philippine Army uniforms. Once Funston and his &quot;captors&quot; entered Aguinaldo&#x27;s camp, they quickly overwhelmed Aguinaldo&#x27;s forces.

On April 1, 1901, at Malacañang Palace in Manila, Aguinaldo swore an oath accepting the authority of the United States over the Philippines and pledging his allegiance to the American government. On April 19, he issued a Proclamation of Formal Surrender to the United States, telling his followers to lay down their weapons and give up the fight.

&quot;Let the stream of blood cease to flow; let there be an end to tears and desolation,&quot; Aguinaldo said. &quot;The lesson which the war holds out and the significance of which I realized only recently, leads me to the firm conviction that the complete termination of hostilities and a lasting peace are not only desirable but also absolutely essential for the well-being of the Philippines.&quot;

The capture of Aguinaldo dealt a severe blow to the Filipino cause, but not as much as the Americans had hoped. General Miguel Malvar took over the leadership of the Filipino government. He originally had taken a defensive stance against the Americans, but launched an offensive against the American-held towns in the Batangas region. General Vicente Lukbán in Samar, and other army officers, continued the war in their respective areas.

===Establishment of U.S. civil government===
On March 3, 1901, the U.S. Congress passed the Army Appropriation Act containing (along with the Platt Amendment on Cuba) the Spooner Amendment which provided the president with legislative authority to establish a civil government in the Philippines. Up until this time, the president had been administering the Philippines by virtue of his war powers. On July 4, 1901, the office of U.S. Military Governor was terminated and civil government was inaugurated with William Howard Taft as civil governor. Hostilities continued, and the civil governor shared power and control with the U.S. military government.

A centralized public school system was installed in 1901, using English as the medium of instruction. This created a heavy shortage of teachers, and the Philippine Commission authorized the secretary of public instruction to engage 600 teachers from the U.S.the so-called Thomasites. Free primary schools that instructed on duties of citizenship and avocation was introduced. The Catholic Church was officially disestablished, and much church land was purchased and redistributed.

An anti-sedition law was established in 1901, followed by an anti-brigandage law in 1902.

===Official end of the war===
On July 4, 1902, Theodore Roosevelt, who had succeeded to the U.S. presidency, proclaimed officially that the war was at an end and extended a full and complete pardon and amnesty to all persons in the Philippine Archipelago who had participated in the conflict.

On April 9, 2002, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo proclaimed that the Philippine–American War had ended on April 16, 1902, with the surrender of Malvar. She declared the centennial anniversary of that date as a national working holiday and as a special non-working holiday in the province of Batangas and in the cities of Batangas, Lipa, and Tanauan.

The Kiram–Bates Treaty secured the Sultanate of Sulu. American forces also established control over interior mountainous areas that had resisted Spanish conquest.

===Internal weaknesses===
Historians Glenn May in 1983 and Rene Escalante in 1998 conclude that Aguinaldo&#x27;s cause had multiple fatal weaknesses: they blame his inept political leadership; his strategic and tactical military blunders; his loss of mass support; his alienation of the Catholics; his failure to mobilize the Filipino elite; squabbling and corruption among his generals; and failure to win any international support for his cause.

==Casualties==
Filipino casualties were much greater than among Americans. The United States Department of State states that the war &quot;resulted in the death of over 4,200 American and over 20,000 Filipino combatants&quot;, and that &quot;as many as 200,000 Filipino civilians died from violence, famine, and disease&quot;. The total number of Filipinos who died remains a matter of debate. Modern sources cite a figure of 200,000 dead civilian Filipinos, with most losses attributable to famine and disease. A cholera epidemic at the war&#x27;s end killed between 150,000 and 200,000 people.

Some estimates reach 1,000,000 dead. In 1903 the population of the Philippines was counted by American authorities. The survey yielded 7,635,426 people, including 56,138 foreign born. In 1887, a Spanish census recorded a population of 5,984,717 excluding non-Christians.

Rudolph Rummel estimates that 16,000 to 20,000 Filipino soldiers and 34,000 civilians were killed, with up to an additional 200,000 civilian deaths, mostly from a cholera epidemic.

In terms of civilian casualties, historian Glen May in an in-depth study one province, argues that the demographic environment was very negative in 1897-1902, as the death rate soared. The main causes were malnutrition caused by massive crop failures, and epidemics of cholera and malaria. Furthermore the 1903 census, was badly flawed. Military casualties had a very small effect.

==Atrocities==

===American atrocities===


Throughout the war, numerous atrocities were committed by the U.S. military, including the targeting of civilians. American soldiers and other witnesses sent letters home that described some of these atrocities. For example, In 1901, the Manila correspondent of the &quot;Philadelphia Ledger&quot; wrote:
Reports from returning soldiers stated that upon entering a village, American soldiers would ransack every house and church and rob the inhabitants of everything of value, while Filipinos who approached the battle line waving a flag of truce were fired upon.

Some of the authors were critical of leaders such as Major General Otis and the overall conduct of the war. In 1899, the American Anti-Imperialist League published a pamphlet of letters allegedly written by U.S. soldiers. When some of these letters circulated in newspapers, they became national news, which forced the War Department to investigate. Examples:
* A soldier from New York: &quot;The town of Titatia was surrendered to us a few days ago, and two companies occupy the same. Last night one of our boys was found shot and his stomach cut open. Immediately orders were received from General Wheaton to burn the town and kill every native in sight; which was done to a finish. About 1,000 men, women and children were reported killed. I am probably growing hard-hearted, for I am in my glory when I can sight my gun on some dark skin and pull the trigger.&quot;
* Corporal Sam Gillis: &quot;We make everyone get into his house by seven p.m., and we only tell a man once. If he refuses we shoot him. We killed over 300 natives the first night. They tried to set the town on fire. If they fire a shot from the house we burn the house down and every house near it, and shoot the natives, so they are pretty quiet in town now.&quot;

Major General Otis&#x27; investigation of the content of these letters consisted of sending a copy of them to the author&#x27;s superior and having him force the author to write a retraction. Soldiers such as Private Charles Brenner refused and he was court-martialed. The charge was &quot;for writing and conniving at the publication of an article which ... contains willful falsehoods concerning himself and a false charge against Captain Bishop.&quot; Not all such letters that discussed atrocities were intended to criticize General Otis or American actions. Many portrayed U.S. actions as the result of Filipino provocation and thus entirely justified.
In September 1901, enraged by the Balangiga massacre in Samar, Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith retaliated during the pacification of Samar by ordering an indiscriminate attack upon its inhabitants, openly disregarding General Order 100, and issuing an order to &quot;kill everyone over the age of ten&quot; and turn the island into a &quot;howling wilderness&quot;. Major Littleton Waller countermanded the order to his own men saying, &quot;we are not making war on women and children&quot;. Still, 2,000 to 2,500 Filipino civilians were killed in the expedition across Samar. This became a caption in the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; cartoon on May 5, 1902. Smith was eventually court-martialed by the American military and forced to retire.

In late 1901, Brigadier General J. Franklin Bell took command of American operations in Batangas and Laguna provinces. In response to Malvar&#x27;s guerrilla warfare tactics, Bell employed counterinsurgency tactics (described by some as a scorched earth campaign) during the pacification of Batangas that took a heavy toll on guerrilla fighters and civilians. &quot;Zones of protection&quot; were established, and civilians were given identification papers and forced into concentration camps (called &quot;reconcentrados&quot;) surrounded by free-fire zones. At the Lodge Committee, in an attempt to counter the negative reception in America to Brigadier General Bell&#x27;s camps, Colonel Arthur Wagner, the U.S. Army&#x27;s chief public relations officer, insisted the camps were to &quot;protect friendly natives from the insurgents, and assure them an adequate food supply&quot; while teaching them &quot;proper sanitary standards&quot;. Wagner&#x27;s assertion was undermined by a letter from a commander of one of the camps, who described them as &quot;some suburb of Hell&quot;.
Methods of torture such as the water cure were frequently employed during interrogation, and entire villages were burned or otherwise destroyed.

During the First Battle of Bud Dajo in March 1906, 800–900 Moros, including women and children, were killed by U.S. Marines led by Major General Leonard Wood. The description of the engagement as a &quot;battle&quot; is disputed because of the overwhelming firepower of the attackers and the lopsided casualties; 99% of Moros were killed in the attack, with only six survivors. Author Vic Hurley wrote, &quot;By no stretch of the imagination could Bud Dajo be termed a &#x27;battle&#x27;&quot;. Mark Twain commented, &quot;In what way was it a battle? It has no resemblance to a battle ... We cleaned up our four days&#x27; work and made it complete by butchering these helpless people.&quot;

===Filipino atrocities===
U.S. Army Major General Otis alleged that Filipino insurgents tortured American prisoners of war in &quot;fiendish fashion&quot;. According to Otis, many were buried alive or were buried up to their necks in ant hills. He claimed others had their genitals removed and stuffed into their mouths and were then executed by suffocation or bled to death. Stories in other newspapers described deliberate attacks by Filipino sharpshooters upon American surgeons, chaplains, ambulances, hospitals, and wounded soldiers. An incident was described in &quot;The San Francisco Call&quot; that occurred in Escalante, Negros Occidental, where several crewmen of a landing party from the CS &quot;Recorder&quot; were fired upon and later disemboweled by Filipino insurgents, while the insurgents displayed a flag of truce.

It was reported that Spanish priests were mutilated before their congregations, and Filipinos who refused to support Aguinaldo were slaughtered in the thousands. American newspaper headlines announced the &quot;Murder and Rapine&quot; by the &quot;Fiendish Filipinos&quot;. Brigadier General Joseph Wheeler insisted that Filipinos had mutilated their own dead, murdered women and children, and burned down villages, solely to discredit American soldiers. Apolinario Mabini, in his autobiography, confirms these offenses, stating that Aguinaldo did not punish Filipino troops who engaged in war rape, burned and looted villages, or stole and destroyed private property.

Other Filipino atrocities included those attributed by the Americans to Filipino commander Lukbán, who allegedly masterminded the Balangiga massacre in Samar province, a surprise Filipino attack that killed almost fifty American soldiers. Media reports stated that many bodies were mutilated.

Testimony before the Lodge Committee stated that natives were given the water cure, &quot;... in order to secure information of the murder of Private O&#x27;Herne of Company I, who had been not only killed, but roasted and otherwise tortured before death ensued.&quot;

In his &quot;History of the Filipino People&quot;, Agoncillo writes that Filipino troops could match/exceed American brutality. Kicking, slapping, and spitting at faces were common. In some cases, ears and noses were cut off and salt applied to the wounds. In other cases, captives were buried alive. These atrocities occurred regardless of Aguinaldo&#x27;s orders and circulars concerning the treatment of prisoners.

Worcester recounts two specific Filipino atrocities as follows:
==Campaigns==
==Political atmosphere==

===First Philippine Commission===

The Schurman Commission concluded that &quot;... The Filipinos are wholly unprepared for independence ... there being no Philippine nation, but only a collection of different peoples.&quot; In the report that they issued to McKinley the following year, the commissioners acknowledged Filipino aspirations for independence; they declared, however, that the Philippines was not ready for it. Specific recommendations included the establishment of civilian control over Manila (Otis would have veto power over the city&#x27;s government), creation of civilian government as rapidly as possible, especially in areas already declared &quot;pacified&quot;, including the establishment of a bicameral legislature, autonomous governments on the provincial and municipal levels, and a system of free public elementary schools.

On November 2, 1900, Schurman signed the following statement:
===Second Philippine Commission===
The Second Philippine Commission, appointed by President McKinley on March 16, 1900, and headed by William Howard Taft, was granted legislative as well as limited executive powers. On September 1, the Taft Commission began to exercise legislative functions. Between September 1900 and August 1902, it issued 499 laws. The commission established a civil service and a judicial system that included a Supreme Court, and a legal code was drawn up to replace obsolete Spanish ordinances. The 1901 municipal code provided for popularly elected presidents, vice presidents, and councilors to serve on municipal boards. The municipal board members were responsible for collecting taxes, maintaining municipal properties, and undertaking necessary construction projects; they also elected provincial governors.

===American opposition===
Some Americans, notably William Jennings Bryan, Mark Twain, Andrew Carnegie, Ernest Crosby, and other members of the American Anti-Imperialist League, strongly objected to the annexation of the Philippines. Anti-imperialist movements claimed that the United States had become a colonial power.

Some anti-imperialists opposed annexation on racist grounds. Among these was Senator Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina, who feared that annexation of the Philippines would lead to an influx of non-white immigrants into the United States. Others worried that annexing the Philippines would lead to the non-white population having a say in the American government.

As news of atrocities committed in subduing the Philippines arrived in the United States, support for the war flagged.

====Mark Twain====
Mark Twain opposed the war using his influence in the press. He said the war betrayed the ideals of American democracy by not allowing the Filipino people to choose their own destiny:
In a diary passage, Twain refers to American troops as &quot;our uniformed assassins&quot; and describes their killing of &quot;six hundred helpless and weaponless savages&quot; in the Philippines as &quot;a long and happy picnic with nothing to do but sit in comfort and fire the Golden Rule into those people down there and imagine letters to write home to the admiring families, and pile glory upon glory&quot;.

===Filipino opposition===
Some of Aguinaldo&#x27;s associates supported America, even before hostilities began. Pedro Paterno, Aguinaldo&#x27;s prime minister and the author of the 1897 armistice treaty with Spain, advocated the incorporation of the Philippines into the United States in 1898. Other associates sympathetic to the U.S. included Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Benito Legarda, prominent members of Congress; Gregorio Araneta, Aguinaldo&#x27;s Secretary of Justice; and Felipe Buencamino, Aguinaldo&#x27;s Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Buencamino is recorded to have said in 1902: &quot;I am an American and all the money in the Philippines, the air, the light, and the sun I consider American.&quot; Many supporters subsequently held posts in the colonial government.

U.S. Army Captain Matthew Arlington Batson formed the Macabebe Scouts as a native guerrilla force to fight the insurgency from among a tribe of that name having a history of antipathy with Tagalogs.

==Aftermath==

===Postwar conflicts===
After military rule was terminated on July 4, 1901, the Philippine Constabulary was established as an archipelago-wide police force to control brigandage and deal with the remnants of the insurgent movement. Organized and initially commanded by Brigadier General Henry Tureman Allen, the Philippine Constabulary gradually took responsibility for suppressing hostile forces&#x27; activities. Remnants of Aguinaldo&#x27;s Republic, and remnants or holdovers of the &quot;Katipunan&quot; organization, which had predated the American presence, and other resistance groups all remained active, fighting for nearly a decade after the official end of the war. After the close of the war, however, Governor General Taft preferred to rely on the Philippine Constabulary and to treat this as a law enforcement concern. Thus the actions of these remaining guerrilla resistance movements were labeled as brigandage or banditry, and dismissed by the American government as bandits, fanatics and cattle rustlers.

Though most fighting in the Philippines had ceased by the time of Aguinaldo&#x27;s capture in March 1901, guerrilla activity continued in some areas, notably in Samar under Lukbán and in Batangas under Malvar. Acting under authority of section 3 of the Organic Act, President Roosevelt used U.S. military forces to put down these pockets of resistance. The Balangiga massacre on September 28, 1901 triggered a major U.S. pacification operation in Samar. In Batangas, Brigadier General J. Franklin Bell relentlessly pursued Malvar and his men from 1901 through the opening months of 1902, forcing the surrender of many of the Filipino soldiers. Malvar surrendered on April 16, 1902. along with his sick wife and children and some of his officers. By the end of the month nearly 3,000 of Malvar&#x27;s men had also surrendered. 

In 1902, Macario Sakay established the &quot;Republika ng Katagalugan&quot;, claiming to succeed the First Philippine Republic, in Morong along Katipunan lines as opposed to Aguinaldo&#x27;s Republic. This republic ended in 1906 when Sakay and his top followers surrendered based on offer of amnesty from the American authorities. Instead, they were arrested by constabulary forces under Colonel Harry Hill Bandholtz and executed the following year.

Beginning in 1903, brigandage by organized groups became a problem in some outlying provinces in the Visayas. Among these groups were the Pulahan (Spanish: &quot;Pulajanes&quot;), who were from the highlands of Samar and Leyte. The term is derived from the native word &quot;pula&quot;, meaning &quot;red&quot;, as they were distinguished by their red garments. The Pulajanes subscribed to a blend of Catholic and folk beliefs. For example, they believed certain amulets called &quot;agimat&quot; would render them bulletproof. The last of these groups were defeated or had surrendered to the Philippine Constabulary by 1911.

The American government had signed the Kiram–Bates Treaty with the Sultanate of Sulu at the outbreak of the war, which was supposed to prevent resistance in that part of the Philippines (which included parts of Mindanao, the Sulu Archipelago, Palawan, and Sabah). However, after the First Philippine Republic collapsed, the United States canceled the treaty, and began to colonize Moro land, which provoked the Moro Rebellion, beginning with the Battle of Bayan in May 1902. The rebellion continued until the Battle of Bud Bagsak in June 1913, in which Moro forces under Datu Amil were defeated by US troops led by Brigadier General John J. Pershing. The battle marked the end of the Moro conflict; negotiations between the US authorities and Sulu Sultanate continued until the latter&#x27;s dissolution in March 1915.

A 1907 law prohibited the display of flags and other symbols &quot;used during the late insurrection in the Philippine Islands&quot;. Some historians consider these unofficial extensions to be part of the war.

===Cultural impact===
The influence of the Roman Catholic Church was reduced when the secular United States Government disestablished the Church and purchased and redistributed Church lands, one of the earliest attempts at land reform in the Philippines. The land amounted to , for which the Church asked $12,086,438.11 in March 1903. The purchase was completed on December 22, 1903, at a sale price of $7,239,784.66. The land redistribution program was stipulated in at least three laws: the Philippine Organic Act, the Public Lands Act, and the Friar Lands Act. Section 10 of the Public Lands Act limited purchases to a maximum of 16 hectares for an individual or 1024 hectares for a corporation or like association. Land was also offered for lease to landless farmers, at prices ranging from fifty centavos to one peso and fifty centavos per hectare per annum. Section 28 of the Public Lands Act stipulated that lease contracts ran for a maximum of 25 years, renewable for another 25 years.

In 1901, at least five hundred teachers (365 males and 165 females) arrived from the U.S. aboard the . The name &quot;Thomasite&quot; was adopted for these teachers, who established education as one of America&#x27;s contributions to the Philippines. Among the assignments given were Albay, Catanduanes, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, and Masbate, which are the present day Bicol Region, which was heavily resistant to American rule. Twenty-seven of the original Thomasites either died of tropical diseases or were murdered by Filipino rebels during their first 20 months of residence. Despite the hardships, the Thomasites persisted, teaching and building learning institutions. They opened the Philippine Normal School (now Philippine Normal University) and the Philippine School of Arts and Trades (PSAT) in 1901 and reopened the Philippine Nautical School, established in 1839 by the Board of Commerce of Manila under Spain. By the end of 1904, primary courses were mostly taught by Filipinos under American supervision.

According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, the first 15 American officers to hold the office of Chief of Staff of the United States Army all served in the Philippine–American War. Some veterans of the war, including Douglas MacArthur, Chester W. Nimitz, Walter Krueger, and Rapp Brush were senior commanders in the US campaign to liberate the Philippines from the Empire of Japan during World War II.

====In the media====
Multiple films were based on the war: &quot;Virgin Forest&quot; (1985), &quot;Baler&quot; (2008), &quot;Amigo&quot; (2010), &quot;El Presidente&quot; (2012), &quot;Heneral Luna&quot; (2015), and &quot;&quot; (2018). The film &quot;Sakay&quot; portrays the latter part of the life of Filipino patriot and hero Macario Sakay. &quot;&quot; is a biographical film about the life of Miguel Malvar; it has been in development since 2000 and is still pending release.

The 1945 film &quot;Los últimos de Filipinas&quot; and the 2016 film &quot;1898, Los últimos de Filipinas&quot; depict the siege of Baler.

In the U,S., the 1926 film &quot;Across the Pacific&quot; and the 1949 film &quot;Last Stand in the Philippines&quot; are about or are set against a background of the war. The 1939 film &quot;The Real Glory&quot; is set against the backdrop of the Moro Rebellion beginning in 1906.

===Philippine independence and sovereignty (1946)===

The Schurman Commission declared that the Philippines was not ready for independence. Specific recommendations included the rapid establishment of civilian government, including establishment of a bicameral legislature, autonomous governments on the provincial and municipal levels, and a new system of free public elementary schools.

From the beginning, United States presidents and their representatives in the islands defined their colonial mission as tutelage: preparing the Philippines for eventual independence. Except for a small group of &quot;retentionists&quot;, the issue was not whether the Philippines would be granted self-rule, but when and under what conditions. Thus, political development in the islands was rapid in light of the complete lack of representative institutions under the Spanish. The Philippine Organic Act of July 1902 stipulated that with the achievement of peace, a legislature would be established composed of a popularly elected lower house, the Philippine Assembly, and an upper house consisting of the Philippine Commission, which was to be appointed by the United States president.

The Jones Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1916 to serve as the organic law in the Philippines, promised eventual independence and instituted an elected Philippine Senate. The Tydings–McDuffie Act (officially the Philippine Independence Act; Public Law 73–127) approved on March 24, 1934, provided for self-government and for independence after ten years. World War II intervened, bringing the Japanese occupation between 1941 and 1945. In 1946, the Treaty of Manila between the governments of the U.S. and the Republic of the Philippines provided for the recognition of the independence of the Philippines and the relinquishment of American sovereignty over the islands.

<text>TEMPEST is a codename, not an acronym under the U.S. National Security Agency specification and a NATO certification referring to spying on information systems through leaking emanations, including unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations. TEMPEST covers both methods to spy upon others and how to shield equipment against such spying. The protection efforts are also known as emission security (EMSEC), which is a subset of communications security (COMSEC). The reception methods fall under the umbrella of radiofrequency MASINT.

The NSA methods for spying on computer emissions are classified, but some of the protection standards have been released by either the NSA or the Department of Defense. Protecting equipment from spying is done with distance, shielding, filtering, and masking. The TEMPEST standards mandate elements such as equipment distance from walls, amount of shielding in buildings and equipment, and distance separating wires carrying classified vs. unclassified materials, filters on cables, and even distance and shielding between wires or equipment and building pipes. Noise can also protect information by masking the actual data.

While much of TEMPEST is about leaking electromagnetic emanations, it also encompasses sounds and mechanical vibrations. For example, it is possible to log a user&#x27;s keystrokes using the motion sensor inside smartphones. Compromising emissions are defined as unintentional intelligence-bearing signals which, if intercepted and analyzed (side-channel attack), may disclose the information transmitted, received, handled, or otherwise processed by any information-processing equipment.

==History==
During World War II, The Bell System supplied the U.S. military with the 131-B2 mixer device that encrypted teleprinter signals by XOR’ing them with key material from one-time tapes (the SIGTOT system) or, earlier, a rotor-based key generator called SIGCUM. It used electromechanical relays in its operation. Later, Bell informed the Signal Corps that they were able to detect electromagnetic spikes at a distance from the mixer and recover the plain text. Meeting skepticism over whether the phenomenon they discovered in the laboratory could really be dangerous, they demonstrated their ability to recover plain text from a Signal Corps’ crypto center on Varick Street in Lower Manhattan. Now alarmed, the Signal Corps asked Bell to investigate further. Bell identified three problem areas: radiated signals, signals conducted on wires extending from the facility, and magnetic fields. As possible solutions, they suggested shielding, filtering and masking.
Bell developed a modified mixer, the 131-A1 with shielding and filtering, but it proved difficult to maintain and too expensive to deploy. Instead, relevant commanders were warned of the problem and advised to control a -diameter zone around their communications center to prevent covert interception, and things were left at that. Then in 1951, the CIA rediscovered the problem with the 131-B2 mixer and found they could recover plain text off the line carrying the encrypted signal from a quarter mile away. Filters for signal and power lines were developed, and the recommended control-perimeter radius was extended to , based more on what commanders could be expected to accomplish than any technical criteria.

A long process of evaluating systems and developing possible solutions followed. Other compromising effects were discovered, such as fluctuations in the power line as rotors stepped. The question of exploiting the noise of electromechanical encryption systems had been raised in the late 1940s but was re-evaluated now as a possible threat. Acoustical emanations could reveal plain text, but only if the pick-up device was close to the source. Nevertheless, even mediocre microphones would do. Soundproofing the room made the problem worse by removing reflections and providing a cleaner signal to the recorder.
In 1956, the Naval Research Laboratory developed a better mixer that operated at much lower voltages and currents and therefore radiated far less. It was incorporated in newer NSA encryption systems. However, many users needed the higher signal levels to drive teleprinters at greater distances or where multiple teleprinters were connected, so the newer encryption devices included the option to switch the signal back up to the higher strength. The NSA began developing techniques and specifications for isolating sensitive-communications pathways through filtering, shielding, grounding, and physical separation: of those lines that carried sensitive plain text—from those intended to carry only non-sensitive data, the latter often extending outside of the secure environment. This separation effort became known as the Red/Black Concept. A 1958 joint policy called NAG-1 set radiation standards for equipment and installations based on a limit of control. It also specified the classification levels of various aspects of the TEMPEST problem. The policy was adopted by Canada and the UK the next year. Six organizations—the Navy, Army, Air Force, NSA, CIA, and the State Department—were to provide the bulk of the effort for its implementation.

Difficulties quickly emerged. Computerization was becoming important to processing intelligence data, and computers and their peripherals had to be evaluated, wherein many of them evidenced vulnerabilities. The Friden Flexowriter, a popular I/O typewriter at the time, proved to be among the strongest emitters, readable at distances up to in field tests. The U.S. Communications Security Board (USCSB) produced a Flexowriter Policy that banned its use overseas for classified information and limited its use within the U.S. to the Confidential level, and then only within a security zone, but users found the policy onerous and impractical. Later, the NSA found similar problems with the introduction of cathode-ray-tube displays (CRTs), which were also powerful radiators.

There was a multiyear process of moving from policy recommendations to more strictly enforced TEMPEST rules. The resulting Directive 5200.19, coordinated with 22 separate agencies, was signed by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in December 1964, but still took months to fully implement. The NSA&#x27;s formal implementation took effect in June 1966.

Meanwhile, the problem of acoustic emanations became more critical with the discovery of some 900 microphones in U.S. installations overseas, most behind the Iron Curtain. The response was to build room-within-a-room enclosures, some transparent, nicknamed &quot;fish bowls&quot;. Other units were fully shielded to contain electronic emanations, but were unpopular with the personnel who were supposed to work inside; they called the enclosures &quot;meat lockers&quot;, and sometimes just left their doors open. Nonetheless, they were installed in critical locations, such as the embassy in Moscow, where two were installed: one for State Department use and one for military attachés. A unit installed at the NSA for its key-generation equipment cost $134,000.

TEMPEST standards continued to evolve in the 1970s and later, with newer testing methods and more nuanced guidelines that took account of the risks in specific locations and situations. During the 80s, security needs were often met with resistance. According to NSA&#x27;s David G. Boak, &quot;Some of what we still hear today in our own circles, when rigorous technical standards are whittled down in the interest of money and time, are frighteningly reminiscent of the arrogant Third Reich with their Enigma cryptomachine.&quot; 

==Shielding standards==
Many specifics of the TEMPEST standards are classified, but some elements are public. Current United States and NATO Tempest standards define three levels of protection requirements:
*NATO SDIP-27 Level A (formerly AMSG 720B) and USA NSTISSAM Level I
:&quot;Compromising Emanations Laboratory Test Standard&quot;
:This is the strictest standard for devices that will be operated in &quot;NATO Zone 0&quot; environments, where it is assumed that an attacker has almost immediate access (e.g. neighbouring room, 1 metre; 3&#x27; distance).
*NATO SDIP-27 Level B (formerly AMSG 788A) and USA NSTISSAM Level II
:&quot;Laboratory Test Standard for Protected Facility Equipment&quot;
:This is a slightly relaxed standard for devices that are operated in &quot;NATO Zone 1&quot; environments, where it is assumed that an attacker cannot get closer than about 20 metres (65&#x27;) (or where building materials ensure an attenuation equivalent to the free-space attenuation of this distance).
*NATO SDIP-27 Level C (formerly AMSG 784) and USA NSTISSAM Level III
:&quot;Laboratory Test Standard for Tactical Mobile Equipment/Systems&quot;
:An even more relaxed standard for devices operated in &quot;NATO Zone 2&quot; environments, where attackers have to deal with the equivalent of 100 metres (300&#x27;) of free-space attenuation (or equivalent attenuation through building materials).

Additional standards include:
*NATO SDIP-29 (formerly AMSG 719G)
:&quot;Installation of Electrical Equipment for the Processing of Classified Information&quot;
:This standard defines installation requirements, for example in respect to grounding and cable distances.
*AMSG 799B
:&quot;NATO Zoning Procedures&quot;
:Defines an attenuation measurement procedure, according to which individual rooms within a security perimeter can be classified into Zone 0, Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3, which then determines what shielding test standard is required for equipment that processes secret data in these rooms.

The NSA and Department of Defense have declassified some TEMPEST elements after Freedom of Information Act requests, but the documents black out many key values and descriptions. The declassified version of the TEMPEST test standard is heavily redacted, with emanation limits and test procedures blacked out. A redacted version of the introductory Tempest handbook NACSIM 5000 was publicly released in December 2000. Additionally, the current NATO standard SDIP-27 (before 2006 known as AMSG 720B, AMSG 788A, and AMSG 784) is still classified.
Despite this, some declassified documents give information on the shielding required by TEMPEST standards. For example, Military Handbook 1195 includes the chart at the right, showing electromagnetic shielding requirements at different frequencies. A declassified NSA specification for shielded enclosures offers similar shielding values, requiring, &quot;a minimum of 100 dB insertion loss from 1 kHz to 10 GHz.&quot; Since much of the current requirements are still classified, there are no publicly available correlations between this 100 dB shielding requirement and the newer zone-based shielding standards.

In addition, many separation distance requirements and other elements are provided by the declassified NSA red-black installation guidance, NSTISSAM TEMPEST/2-95.

==Certification==
The information-security agencies of several NATO countries publish lists of accredited testing labs and of equipment that has passed these tests:
*In Canada: Canadian Industrial TEMPEST Program
*In Germany: BSI German Zoned Products List
*In the UK: UK CESG Directory of Infosec Assured Products, Section 12
*In the U.S.: NSA TEMPEST Certification Program

The United States Army also has a TEMPEST testing facility, as part of the U.S. Army Electronic Proving Ground, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Similar lists and facilities exist in other NATO countries.

TEMPEST certification must apply to entire systems, not just to individual components, since connecting a single unshielded component (such as a cable or device) to an otherwise secure system could dramatically alter the system RF characteristics.

==RED/BLACK separation==
TEMPEST standards require &quot;RED/BLACK separation&quot;, i.e., maintaining distance or installing shielding between circuits and equipment used to handle plaintext classified or sensitive information that is not encrypted (RED) and secured circuits and equipment (BLACK), the latter including those carrying encrypted signals. Manufacture of TEMPEST-approved equipment must be done under careful quality control to ensure that additional units are built exactly the same as the units that were tested. Changing even a single wire can invalidate the tests.

==Correlated emanations==
One aspect of TEMPEST testing that distinguishes it from limits on spurious emissions (&quot;e.g.&quot;, FCC Part 15) is a requirement of absolute minimal correlation between radiated energy or detectable emissions and any plaintext data that are being processed.

==Public research==
In 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; Van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set.

As a consequence of this research, such emanations are sometimes called &quot;Van Eck radiation&quot;, and the eavesdropping technique Van Eck phreaking, although government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of Additionally the NSA published &quot;Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency&quot; (Classified) on February 1, 1982. In addition, the Van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s.

Markus Kuhn has discovered several low-cost techniques for reducing the chances that emanations from computer displays can be monitored remotely. With CRT displays and analog video cables, filtering out high-frequency components from fonts before rendering them on a computer screen will attenuate the energy at which text characters are broadcast. With modern flat panel displays, the high-speed digital serial interface (DVI) cables from the graphics controller are a main source of compromising emanations. Adding random noise to the least significant bits of pixel values may render the emanations from flat-panel displays unintelligible to eavesdroppers but is not a secure method. Since DVI uses a certain bit code scheme that tries to transport a balanced signal of 0 bits and 1 bits, there may not be much difference between two pixel colors that differ very much in their color or intensity. The emanations can differ drastically even if only the last bit of a pixel&#x27;s color is changed. The signal received by the eavesdropper also depends on the frequency where the emanations are detected. The signal can be received on many frequencies at once and each frequency&#x27;s signal differs in contrast and brightness related to a certain color on the screen. Usually, the technique of smothering the RED signal with noise is not effective unless the power of the noise is sufficient to drive the eavesdropper&#x27;s receiver into saturation thus overwhelming the receiver input.

LED indicators on computer equipment can be a source of compromising optical emanations. One such technique involves the monitoring of the lights on a dial-up modem. Almost all modems flash an LED to show activity, and it is common for the flashes to be directly taken from the data line. As such, a fast optical system can easily see the changes in the flickers from the data being transmitted down the wire.

Recent research has shown it is possible to detect the radiation corresponding to a keypress event from not only wireless (radio) keyboards, but also from traditional wired keyboards [the PS/2 keyboard, for example, contains a microprocessor which will radiate some amount of radio frequency energy when responding to keypresses], and even from laptop keyboards. From the 1970s onward, Soviet bugging of US Embassy IBM Selectric typewriters allowed the keypress-derived mechanical motion of bails, with attached magnets, to be detected by implanted magnetometers, and converted via hidden electronics to a digital radio frequency signal. Each eight character transmission provided Soviet access to sensitive documents, as they were being typed, at US facilities in Moscow and Leningrad.

In 2014, researchers introduced &quot;AirHopper&quot;, a bifurcated attack pattern showing the feasibility of data exfiltration from an isolated computer to a nearby mobile phone, using FM frequency signals.

In 2015, &quot;BitWhisper&quot;, a Covert Signaling Channel between Air-Gapped Computers using Thermal Manipulations was introduced. &quot;BitWhisper&quot; supports bidirectional communication and requires no additional dedicated peripheral hardware. Later in 2015, researchers introduced GSMem, a method for exfiltrating data from air-gapped computers over cellular frequencies. The transmission - generated by a standard internal bus - renders the computer into a small cellular transmitter antenna. In February 2018, research was published describing how low frequency magnetic fields can be used to escape sensitive data from Faraday-caged, air-gapped computers with malware code-named ’ODINI’ that can control the low frequency magnetic fields emitted from infected computers by regulating the load of CPU cores.

In 2018, a class of side-channel attack was introduced at ACM and Black Hat by Eurecom&#x27;s researchers: &quot;Screaming Channels&quot;. This kind of attack targets mixed-signal chips — containing an analog and digital circuit on the same silicon die — with a radio transmitter. The results of this architecture, often found in connected objects, is that the digital part of the chip will leak some metadata on its computations into the analog part, which leads to metadata&#x27;s leak being encoded in the noise of the radio transmission. Thanks to signal-processing techniques, researchers were able to extract cryptographic keys used during the communication and decrypt the content. This attack class is supposed, by the authors, to be known already for many years by governmental intelligence agencies.

==In popular culture==
*In the television series &quot;Numb3rs&quot;, season 1 episode &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, a wire connected to a high gain antenna was used to &quot;read&quot; from a computer monitor.
*In the television series &quot;Spooks&quot;, season 4 episode &quot;The Sting&quot;, a failed attempt to read information from a computer that has no network link is described.
*In the novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; by Neal Stephenson, characters use Van Eck phreaking to likewise read information from a computer monitor in a neighboring room.
*In the television series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, season 1 episode &quot;Ragtag&quot;, an office is scanned for digital signatures in the UHF spectrum.
*In the video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&quot;, part of the final mission involves spying on a meeting in a TEMPEST-hardened war room. Throughout the entire &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; series, a laser microphone is used as well.
* In the video game &quot;Rainbow Six: Siege&quot;, the operator Mute has experience in TEMPEST specifications. He designed a Signal Disrupter initially to ensure that hidden microphones in sensitive meetings would not transmit, and adapted them for combat, capable of disrupting remotely activated devices like breaching charges.
* In the novel series The Laundry Files by Charles Stross, the character James Angleton (high-ranking officer of an ultra-secret intelligence agency) always uses low tech devices such as a typewriter or a Memex to defend against TEMPEST (despite the building being TEMPEST-shielded).

<doc id="184783" wikidata="Q742324" url="?curid=184783" title="Frotteurism">
<text>Frotteurism is a paraphilic interest in rubbing, usually one&#x27;s pelvic area or erect penis, against a non-consenting person for sexual pleasure. It may involve touching any part of the body, including the genital area. A person who practices frotteuristic acts is known as a &quot;frotteur&quot;.

Toucherism is sexual arousal based on grabbing or rubbing one&#x27;s hands against an unexpecting (and non-consenting) person. It usually involves touching breasts, buttocks or genital areas, often while quickly walking across the victim&#x27;s path. Some psychologists consider toucherism a manifestation of frotteurism, while others distinguish the two. In clinical medicine, treatment of frotteuristic disorder involves cognitive behavioral therapy coupled with the administration of an SSRI.

== Etymology and history ==
Frotteuristic acts were probably first interpreted as signs of a psychological disorder by French psychiatrist Valentin Magnan, who described three acts of &quot;frottage&quot; in an 1890 study. &quot;Frottage&quot; derives from the French verb &quot;frotter&quot;, meaning &quot;to rub&quot;. &quot;Frotteur&quot; is a French noun literally meaning &quot;one who rubs&quot;. It was popularized by German sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his book &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot;, borrowing from Magnan&#x27;s French terminology. Clifford Allen later coined &quot;frotteurism&quot; in his 1969 textbook of sexual disorders.

The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; called this sexual disorder by the name &quot;frottage&quot; until the third edition (DSM III-R), but changed to &quot;frotteurism&quot; in the fourth edition, and now uses &quot;frotteuristic disorder&quot; in the fifth edition. Nevertheless, the term &quot;frottage&quot; still remains in some law codes where it is synonymous with the term &quot;frotteurism&quot;.

== Symptoms and classification ==
The professional handbook of the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, fifth edition, lists the following diagnostic criteria for &quot;frotteuristic disorder&quot;.

* Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
* The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

If the individual has not acted on their interest and experiences no distress or impairment, they are considered to have a frotteuristic sexual interest, but not frotteuristic disorder. Some sexologists distinguish between frotteurism (as pelvic rubbing) and toucherism (as groping with hands), but the DSM does not. Sexologist Kurt Freund described frotteurism and toucherism as courtship disorders that occur at the tactile stage of human courtship.

== Prevalence and legality ==
The prevalence of frotteurism is unknown. The DSM estimates that 10–14% of men seen in clinical settings for paraphilias or hypersexuality have frotteuristic disorder, indicating that the population prevalence is lower. However, frotteuristic acts, as opposed to frotteuristic disorder, may occur in up to 30% of men in the general population. The majority of frotteurs are male and the majority of victims are female, although female on male, female on female, and male on male frotteurs exist. This activity is often done in circumstances where the victim cannot easily respond, in a public place such as a crowded train or concert. Marco Vassi&#x27;s story &quot;Subway Dick&quot; is an example of such acts in a train.

Usually, such nonconsensual sexual contact is viewed as a criminal offense: a form of sexual assault albeit often classified as a misdemeanor with minor legal penalties. Conviction may result in a sentence or psychiatric treatment.

<text>James Tyler Kent (1849–1916) was an American physician best remembered as a forefather of modern homeopathy. In 1897 Kent published a massive guidebook on human physical and mental disease symptoms and their associated homeopathic preparations entitled &quot;Repertory of the Homeopathic Materia Medica&quot;, which has been translated into a number of languages. It has been the blueprint to many modern repertories used throughout the world and even remains in use by some homeopathic practitioners today.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
James Tyler Kent was born on March 31, 1849, in Woodhull, New York, the son of Steven Kent and his wife Caroline Tyler. Kent was raised as a staunch Baptist.

Kent attended secondary school at the Franklin Academy of Prattsburgh, New York before enrolling at Madison University (today&#x27;s Colgate University), from which he was graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1868. He earned a master&#x27;s degree from the same institution in 1870.

Kent attended the Institute of Eclectic Medicine at Cincinnati, Ohio, where, in addition to standard medicine, he studied naturopathy, homeopathy, and chiropractic. Kent graduated from the institute in 1873.

===Career===
In 1874, Kent married Ellen and settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he took up medical practice. His wife died shortly after marriage at the age of 19. He set up practice as an eclectic physician in St Louis, Missouri and soon became a distinguished member of the Eclectic National Medical Association. He took a post as a professor of anatomy at American College in St. Louis two years later.

In 1878, Kent&#x27;s second wife, Lucy, became ill. In spite of Lucy&#x27;s symptoms of &quot;nervous weakness, insomnia, and anaemia&quot; being treated by both orthodox and eclectic physicians, her condition continued to deteriorate and she was bedridden for months. On Dr.Kent&#x27;s wife&#x27;s request Dr Richard Phelan a homoeopathic physician, was called in to see Lucy. Following his prescription, she made a dramatic recovery. As a result, Kent elected to study with Phelan and changed from eclecticism to homoeopathy.

It was at this time that he became a fervent adherent of the precepts of homeopathy, a branch of alternative medicine that purports to treat patients through the administration of &quot;remedies&quot; containing massively diluted forms of substances that, if given to a healthy person would supposedly cause symptoms similar to the disease. It is believed by homeopaths that the introduction of such &quot;similars&quot; into the body effectively stimulates it to defeat the ailment or disease.

In 1881, Kent accepted a position as professor of anatomy at the Homeopathic College of Missouri, an institution with which he remained affiliated until 1888. During this period, Kent&#x27;s second wife died.

In 1890, Kent moved to Pennsylvania to take a position as Dean of Professors at the Post-Graduate Homeopathic Medical School of Philadelphia. He remained in that position until 1899.

Clara Louis Tobey, a doctor turned homoeopath, was treated by Dr. Kent and she later on became his wife and she helped him in completing his famous works which were published.

In 1897 Kent published his magnum opus, &quot;Repertory of the Homœopathic Materia Medica.&quot; This guidebook to ailments and their associated &quot;similars&quot; remains the repertory on which much of the modern practice of homeopathy is based.

Kent edited the &quot;Journal of Homeopathics&quot; from 1897 to 1903, producing seven volumes of the journal.

Kent moved to Chicago in 1903, where he taught at Hahnemann Medical College. Kent remained at that post until his departure in 1909 to become professor and Dean of Hering Medical College and Hospital, an institution also located in Chicago.

In November 1910, Kent was instrumental in the establishment of the Society of Homeopathicians as a means of disseminating the principles of homeopathy promulgated by Hahnemann. The group published its own journal, &quot;The Homeopathician.&quot;

Kent wrote voluminously and his works were published into several non-English languages during the course of his life. He gained a significant number of adherents in India, a country in which several publishers of his work of the late 20th and early 21st centuries are located.

===Ideas===
Kent is remembered for his arguments against the germ theory of disease. 

A Swedenborgian, Kent held that medical science must be united to religion; &quot;You cannot divorce medicine and theology. Man exists all the way down from his innermost spiritual, to his outermost natural.&quot;
In this reference, &quot;spiritual&quot; is meant as a description of the mind: the mental and emotional pathology of a patient.

Kent was a vitalist, a believer of the theory that all living things have what was called &quot;the vital force&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
Kent died of Bright&#x27;s disease on June 5, 1916, in Stevensville, Montana. He was 67 years old at the time of his death.

Not long after his death, Kent was eulogized by one contemporary as
British homeopath Francis Treuherz has characterized James Tyler Kent as &quot;the ultimate homeopath of the period when homeopathy flourished in America.&quot; Treuherz noted Kent&#x27;s pioneering use of extremely high dilutions, called &quot;high potencies&quot; by adherents of homeopathy, and &quot;meticulous scholarship in the creation of his repertory&quot; as among Kent&#x27;s primary attributes as the homeopathic exemplar of his generation.

<text>Joseph (; ) is an important Hebrew figure in the Bible&#x27;s Book of Genesis. He was the first of the two sons of Jacob and Rachel (Jacob&#x27;s twelfth named child and eleventh son). He is the founder of the Tribe of Joseph among the Israelites. His story functions as an explanation for Israel&#x27;s residence in Egypt. He is the favourite son of the patriarch Jacob, and his envious brothers sell him into slavery in Biblical Egypt, where he eventually ends up incarcerated. After correctly interpreting the dreams of Pharaoh, however, he rises to second-in-command in Egypt and saves Egypt during a famine. Jacob&#x27;s family travels to Egypt to escape the famine, and it is through him that they are given leave to settle in the Land of Goshen (the eastern part of the Nile Delta).

Scholars hold different opinions about the historical background of the Joseph story, as well as the date and development of its composition. Some scholars suggest that the biblical story of Joseph (Gen 37-50) was a multigenerational work with both early and late components. Others hold that the original Joseph story was a Persian period diaspora novella from the perspective of Judeans living in Egypt.

In Jewish tradition, he is the ancestor of a second Messiah called &quot;Mashiach ben Yosef&quot;, who will wage war against the forces of evil alongside Mashiach ben David and die in combat with the enemies of God and Israel.

== Etymology ==
The Bible offers two explanations of the name &quot;Yosēf:&quot; first, it is compared to the triliteral א־ס־ף (&quot;ʾ-s-p&quot;), meaning &quot;to gather, remove, take away&quot;: &quot;And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath &quot;taken away&quot; my reproach&quot; (Genesis 30:23); &quot;Yosēf&quot; is then identified with the similar root (&quot;y-s-p&quot;), meaning &quot;to add&quot;: &quot;And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall &quot;add&quot; to me another son.&quot; (Genesis 30:24).

==Biblical narrative==
===Birth and family===
Joseph, son of Jacob and Rachel, lived in the land of Canaan with ten half-brothers, one full brother, and at least one half-sister. He was Rachel&#x27;s firstborn and Jacob&#x27;s eleventh son. Of all the sons, Joseph was preferred by his father, who gave him a &quot;long coat of many colors&quot;. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he shared with his brothers two dreams he had: in the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain, of which those his brothers gathered, bowed to his own. In the second dream, the sun (father), the moon (mother), and eleven stars (brothers) bowed to Joseph himself. These dreams, implying his supremacy, angered his brothers () and made the brothers plot his demise. 
===Plot against Joseph===

In Genesis 37, &quot;Vayeshev&quot;, Joseph&#x27;s half-brothers were envious of him. Most of them plotted to kill him in Dothan, except Reuben, who suggested they throw Joseph into an empty cistern; he intended to rescue Joseph himself later. Unaware of this plan to rescue Joseph, the others agreed with Reuben. Upon imprisoning Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, and sold Joseph to these merchants. The guilty brothers painted goat&#x27;s blood on Joseph&#x27;s coat and showed it to Jacob, who therefore believed Joseph had died.

===Potiphar&#x27;s house===
In Genesis 39, &quot;Vayeshev&quot;, Joseph was sold to Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh&#x27;s guard. Later, Joseph became Potiphar&#x27;s servant, and subsequently his household&#x27;s superintendent. Here, Potiphar&#x27;s wife (later called Zulaykha) tried to seduce Joseph, which he refused. Angered by his running away from her, she made a false accusation of rape so he would be imprisoned.

===Joseph in prison===
The warden put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners and soon afterward Pharaoh&#x27;s chief cup-bearer and chief baker, who had offended the Pharaoh, were thrown into the prison. Both men had dreams, and Joseph, being able to interpret dreams, asked to hear them. 

The cup-bearer&#x27;s dream was about a vine with three branches that was budding. And as it was budding, its blossoms came out and they produced grapes. The cup-bearer took those grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh&#x27;s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh&#x27;s hand. Joseph interpreted this dream as the cup-bearer being restored as cup-bearer to the Pharaoh within three days.

The baker&#x27;s dream was about three baskets full of bread for the Pharaoh, and birds were eating the bread out of those baskets. Joseph interpreted this dream as the baker being hanged within three days and having his flesh eaten by birds.

Joseph requested that the cup-bearer mention him to Pharaoh to secure his release from prison, but the cup-bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph.

After two more years, the Pharaoh dreamt of seven lean cows which devoured seven fat cows; and of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. When the Pharaoh&#x27;s advisers failed to interpret these dreams, the cup-bearer remembered Joseph. Joseph was then summoned. He interpreted the dream as seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine and advised the Pharaoh to store surplus grain.

===Vizier of Egypt===
Following the prediction, Joseph became Vizier, under the name of Zaphnath-Paaneah (Hebrew: צָפְנַת פַּעְנֵחַ &quot;Ṣāp̄naṯ Paʿnēaḥ&quot;), and was given Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On, to be his wife. During the seven years of abundance, Joseph ensured that the storehouses were full and that all produce was weighed. In the sixth year, Asenath bore two children to Joseph: Manasseh and Ephraim. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations came to Egypt to buy bread. The narrative also indicates that they went straight to Joseph or were directed to him, even by the Pharaoh himself (). As a last resort, all of the inhabitants of Egypt, less the Egyptian priestly class, sold their properties and later themselves (as slaves) to Joseph for seed; wherefore Joseph set a mandate that, because the people would be sowing and harvesting seed on government property, a fifth of the produce should go to the Pharaoh. This mandate lasted until the days of Moses ().

===Brothers sent to Egypt===

In the second year of famine, Joseph&#x27;s half brothers were sent to Egypt to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him as their brother Joseph, who was now in his late 30s; but Joseph &quot;did&quot; recognize them and did not speak at all to them in his native tongue of Hebrew. After questioning them, he accused them of being spies. After they mentioned a younger brother at home, the Vizier (Joseph) demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This was Joseph&#x27;s full brother, Benjamin. Joseph placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. When he returned, the Vizier took Simeon and bound him as a hostage. Then he had their donkeys prepared with grain and sent the other brothers back to Canaan. Unbeknownst to them, Joseph had also returned their money to their money sacks ().

===The silver cup===
The remaining brothers returned to their father in Canaan, and told him all that had transpired in Egypt. They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men. Jacob became greatly distressed, feeling deprived of successive sons: Joseph, Simeon, and (prospectively) Benjamin. After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Jacob told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah&#x27;s persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution ().

Upon their return to Egypt, the steward of Joseph&#x27;s house received the brothers. When they were brought to Joseph&#x27;s house, they were apprehensive about the returned money in their money sacks. They thought that the missed transaction would somehow be used against them as way to induct them as slaves and to confiscate their possessions. So they immediately informed the steward of what had transpired. The steward put them at ease, telling them not to worry about the money, and brought out their brother Simeon. Then he brought the brothers into the house of Joseph and received them hospitably. When the Vizier (Joseph) appeared, they gave him gifts from their father. Joseph saw and inquired of Benjamin, and was overcome by emotion but did not show it. He withdrew to his chambers and wept. When he regained control of himself, he returned and ordered a meal to be served. The Egyptians would not dine with Hebrews at the same table, as doing so was considered loathsome, thus the sons of Israel were served at a separate table ().

That night, Joseph ordered his steward to load the brothers&#x27; donkeys with food and all their money. The money they had brought was double what they had offered on the first trip. Deceptively, Joseph also ordered the steward to put his silver cup in Benjamin&#x27;s sack. The following morning the brothers began their journey back to Canaan. Joseph ordered the steward to go after the brothers and to question them about the &quot;missing&quot; silver cup. When the steward caught up with the brothers, he seized them and searched their sacks. The steward found the cup in Benjamin&#x27;s sack - just as he had planted it the night before. This caused a stir amongst the brothers. However, they agreed to be escorted back to Egypt. When the Vizier (Joseph) confronted them about the silver cup, he demanded that the one who possessed the cup in his bag become his slave. In response, Judah pleaded with the Vizier that Benjamin be allowed to return to his father, and that he himself be kept in Benjamin&#x27;s place as a slave ().

===Family reunited===
Judah appealed to the Vizier begging that Benjamin be released and that he be enslaved in his stead, because of the silver cup found in Benjamin&#x27;s sack. The Vizier broke down into tears. He could not control himself any longer and so he sent the Egyptian men out of the house. Then he revealed to the Hebrews that he was in fact their brother, Joseph. He wept so loudly that even the Egyptian household heard it outside. The brothers were frozen and could not utter a word. He brought them closer and relayed to them the events that had happened and told them not to fear, that what they had meant for evil, God had meant for good. Then he commanded them to go and bring their father and his entire household into Egypt to live in the province of Goshen, because there were five more years of famine left. So Joseph supplied them Egyptian transport wagons, new garments, silver money, and twenty additional donkeys carrying provisions for the journey. ()

Thus, Jacob (also known as Israel) and his entire house of seventy gathered up with all their livestock and began their journey to Egypt. As they approached Egyptian territory, Judah went ahead to ask Joseph where the caravan should unload. They were directed into the province of Goshen and Joseph readied his chariot to meet his father there. It had been over twenty years since Joseph had last seen his father. When they met, they embraced each other and wept together for quite a while. His father then remarked, &quot;Now let me die, since I have seen your face, because you are still alive.&quot; ()

Afterward, Joseph&#x27;s family personally met the Pharaoh of Egypt. The Pharaoh honored their stay and even proposed that if there were any qualified men in their house, then they may elect a chief herdsman to oversee Egyptian livestock. Because the Pharaoh had such a high regard for Joseph, practically making him his equal, it had been an honor to meet his father. Thus, Israel was able to bless the Pharaoh (). The family was then settled in Goshen.

===Father&#x27;s blessing and passing===
The house of Israel acquired many possessions and multiplied exceedingly during the course of seventeen years, even through the worst of the seven-year famine. At this time, Joseph&#x27;s father was 147 years old and bedridden. He had fallen ill and lost most of his vision. Joseph was called into his father&#x27;s house and Israel pleaded with his son that he not be buried in Egypt. Rather, he requested to be carried to the land of Canaan to be buried with his forefathers. Joseph was sworn to do as his father asked of him. ()

Later, Joseph came to visit his father having with him his two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Israel declared that they would be heirs to the inheritance of the house of Israel, as if they were his own children, just as Reuben and Simeon were. Then Israel laid his left hand on the eldest Mannasseh&#x27;s head and his right hand on the youngest Ephraim&#x27;s head and blessed Joseph. However, Joseph was displeased that his father&#x27;s right hand was not on the head of his firstborn, so he switched his father&#x27;s hands. But Israel refused saying, &quot;but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he,&quot; a declaration he made just as Israel himself was to his firstborn brother Esau. To Joseph, he gave a portion more of Canaanite property than he had to his other sons; land that he fought for against the Amorites. ()

Then Israel called all of his sons in and prophesied their blessings or curses to all twelve of them in order of their ages. To Joseph he declared:
After relaying his prophecies, Israel died. The family, including the Egyptians, mourned him seventy days. Joseph had his father embalmed, a process that took forty days. Then he prepared a great ceremonial journey to Canaan leading the servants of the Pharaoh, and the elders of the houses Israel and Egypt beyond the Jordan River. They stopped at Atad where they observed seven days of mourning. Here, their lamentation was so great that it caught the attention of surrounding Canaanites who remarked &quot;This is a deep mourning of the Egyptians.&quot; So they named this spot Abel Mizraim. Then Joseph buried Israel in the cave of Machpelah, the property of Abraham when he bought it from the Hittites. ()

After their father died, the brothers of Joseph feared retribution for being responsible for Joseph&#x27;s deliverance into Egypt as a slave. Joseph wept as they spoke and told them that what had happened was God&#x27;s purpose to save lives and the lives of his family. He comforted them and their ties were reconciled. ()

===Joseph&#x27;s burial===

Joseph lived to the age of 110, living to see his great-grandchildren. Before he died, he made the children of Israel swear that when they left the land of Egypt they would take his bones with them, and on his death his body was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt. ()

The children of Israel remembered their oath, and when they left Egypt during the Exodus, Moses took Joseph&#x27;s bones with him. () The bones were buried at Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor (), which has traditionally been identified with site of Joseph&#x27;s Tomb, before Jacob and all his family moved to Egypt. Shechem was in the land which was allocated by Joshua to the Tribe of Ephraim, one of the tribes of the House of Joseph, after the conquest of Canaan.

==Composition and literary motifs==
In 1970, Donald B. Redford argued that the composition of the story could be dated to the period between the 7th century BCE and the third quarter of the 5th century BCE. By the early 1990s, a majority of modern scholars agreed that the Joseph story was a Wisdom novella constructed by a single author and that it reached its current form in the 5th century BCE at the earliest—with Soggin suggesting the possibility of a first or early second century BCE date. Some scholars argue that the core of the story could be traced back to a 2nd millennium BCE context. Thomas Römer argues that “The date of the original narrative can be the late Persian period, and while there are several passages that fit better into a Greek, Ptolemaic context, most of these passages belong to later revisions.”

The motif of dreams/dream interpretation contributes to a strong story-like narrative. The plot begins by showing Joseph as a dreamer; this leads him into trouble as, out of envy, his brothers sell him into slavery. The next two instances of dream interpretation establish his reputation as a great interpreter of dreams; first, he begins in a low place, interpreting the dreams of prisoners. Then Joseph is summoned to interpret the dreams of Pharaoh himself. Impressed with Joseph&#x27;s interpretations, Pharaoh appoints him as second-in-command (Gen 41:41). This sets up the climax of the story, which many regard to be the moment Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers (Gen 45:3).

==Jewish tradition==

===Selling Joseph===
In the midrash, the selling of Joseph was part of God&#x27;s divine plan for him to save his tribes. The favoritism Israel showed Joseph and the plot against him by his brothers were divine means of getting him into Egypt. Maimonides comments that even the villager in Shechem, about whom Joseph inquired his brother&#x27;s whereabouts, was a &quot;divine messenger&quot; working behind the scene.

A midrash asked, &quot;How many times was Joseph sold?&quot; In analyzing , there are five different Hebrew names used to describe five different groups of people involved in the transaction of selling Joseph, according to Rabbi Judah and Rav Huna. The first group identified, are Joseph&#x27;s brothers when Judah brings up the idea of selling Joseph in verses 26 and 27. The first mention of Ishmaelites (Yishma&#x27;elîm) is in verse 25. Then the Hebrew phrase &quot;ŉāshîm midyanîm sōĥrîm&quot; in verse 28 describes Midianite traders. A fourth group in verse 36 is named in Hebrew as &quot;m‘danîm&quot; that is properly identified as Medanites. The final group, where a transaction is made, is among the Egyptians in the same verse.

After identifying the Hebrew names, Rabbi Judah claims that Joseph was sold four times: First his brothers sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites (Yishma&#x27;elîm), then the Ishmaelites sold him to the Midianite traders (ŉāshîm midyanîm sōĥrîm), the Midianite traders to the Medanites (m‘danîm), and the Medanites into Egypt. Rav Huna adds one more sale by concluding that after the Medanites sold him to the Egyptians, a fifth sale occurred when the Egyptians sold him to Potiphar. (Genesis Rabbah 84:22)

===Potiphar&#x27;s wife===
Joseph had good reasons not to have an affair with Potiphar&#x27;s wife: he did not want to abuse his master&#x27;s trust; he believed in the sanctity of marriage; and it went against his ethical, moral and religious principles taught to him by his father Jacob. According to the Midrash, Joseph would have been immediately executed by the sexual assault charge against him by Potiphar&#x27;s wife. Abravanel explains that she had accused other servants of the same crime in the past. Potiphar believed that Joseph was incapable of such an act and petitioned Pharaoh to spare his life. However, punishment could not have been avoided because of her class status and limited public knowledge of her scheme.

According to &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;, the name of Potiphar&#x27;s wife is Zuleikha and when she was enticing Joseph to give up to her sinful passion, God appeared unto him, holding the foundation of earth (&quot;Eben Shetiyah&quot;), that He would destroy the world if Joseph touched her.

===Silver cup for divination===
Jewish tradition holds that Joseph had his steward plant his personal silver cup in Benjamin&#x27;s sack to test his brothers. He wanted to know if they would be willing to risk danger in order to save their half brother Benjamin. Since Joseph and Benjamin were born from Rachel, this test was necessary to reveal if they would betray Benjamin as they did with Joseph when he was seventeen. Because &quot;Joseph the Dreamer&quot; predicts the future by analyzing dreams, alternative Jewish tradition claims that he practiced divination using this silver cup as the steward charged and as Joseph himself claimed in .

===Raising Joseph===
In one Talmudic story, Joseph was buried in the Nile river, as there was some dispute as to which province should be honored by having his tomb within its boundaries. Moses, led there by an ancient holy woman named Serach, was able by a miracle to raise the sarcophagus and to take it with him at the time of the Exodus.

== Christian tradition ==

Joseph is mentioned in the New Testament as an example of faith (). Joseph is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on 26 July. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is known as &quot;Joseph the all-comely&quot;, a reference not only to his physical appearance, but more importantly to the beauty of his spiritual life. They commemorate him on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before Christmas) and on Holy and Great Monday (Monday of Holy Week). In icons, he is sometimes depicted wearing the nemes headdress of an Egyptian vizier. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod commemorates him as a patriarch on 31 March.

In addition to honoring him, there was a strong tendency in the patristic period to view his life as a typological precursor to Christ. This tendency is represented in John Chrysostom who said that Joseph&#x27;s suffering was &quot;a type of things to come&quot;, Caesarius of Arles who interpreted Joseph&#x27;s famous coat as representative of the diverse nations who would follow Christ, Ambrose of Milan who interpreted the standing sheaf as prefiguring the resurrection of Christ, and others.

This tendency, although greatly diminished, was followed throughout late antiquity, the Medieval Era, and into the Reformation. Even John Calvin, sometimes hailed as the father of modern grammatico-historical exegesis, writes &quot;in the person of Joseph, a lively image of Christ is presented.&quot;

In addition, some Christian authors have argued that this typological interpretation finds its origin in the speech of Stephen in Acts , as well as the Gospel of Luke and the parables of Jesus, noting strong verbal and conceptual collocation between the Greek translation of the portion of Genesis concerning Joseph and the Parable of the Wicked Tenants and the Parable of the Prodigal Son.

Gregory of Tours claimed that Joseph built the pyramids and they were used as granaries.

==Islamic tradition==
Joseph (, &quot;&quot;) is regarded by the Quran as a prophet (), and a whole chapter is devoted to him, the only instance in the Quran in which an entire chapter is devoted to a complete story of a person. It is described in the Quran as the &#x27;best of stories&#x27;. Joseph is said to have been extremely handsome, which attracted his Egyptian master&#x27;s wife to attempt to seduce him. Muhammad is believed to have once said, &quot;One half of all the beauty God apportioned for mankind went to Joseph and his mother; the other one half went to the rest of mankind.&quot; The story has a lot in common with the biblical narrative, but with certain differences. In the Quran the brothers ask Jacob (&quot;Yaqub&quot;) to let Joseph go with them. Joseph is thrown into a well, and was taken as a slave by a passing caravan. When the brothers claimed to the father that a wolf had eaten Joseph, he observed patience.

In the Bible, Joseph discloses himself to his brethren before they return to their father the second time after buying grain. But in Islam they returned leaving behind Benjamin because the King’s measuring cup was found in his bag. Similarly, the eldest son of Jacob had decided not to leave the land because of the oath taken to protect Benjamin beforehand. When Jacob learned their story after their return, he cried in grief for so long that he lost his eyesight because of sorrow. He thus charged his sons to go and inquire about Joseph and his brother and despair not of God&#x27;s mercy. It was during this return to Egypt that Joseph disclosed his real identity to his brothers. He admonished and forgave them, he sent also his garment which healed the patriarch&#x27;s eyes as soon as it was cast unto his face. The remaining verses describe the migration of Jacob&#x27;s family to Egypt and the emotional meeting of Jacob and his long lost son, Joseph. The family prostrated before him hence the fulfilment of his dream aforetime.

The story concludes by Joseph praying,
==Baha&#x27;i tradition==
There are numerous mentions of Joseph in Bahá&#x27;í writings. These come in the forms of allusions written by the Báb and Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. In the &quot;Kitáb-i-Aqdas&quot;, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh states that &quot;from my laws, the sweet-smelling savour of my garment can be smelled&quot; and, in the &quot;Four Valleys&quot;, states that &quot;the fragrance of his garment blowing from the Egypt of Baha,&quot; referring to Joseph.

Bahá&#x27;í commentaries have described these as metaphors with the garment implying the recognition of a manifestation of God. In the &quot;Qayyumu&#x27;l-Asma&#x27;&quot;, the Báb refers to Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh as the true Joseph and makes an analogous prophecy regarding Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh suffering at the hands of his brother, Mírzá Yahyá.

<text>A Requiem (Latin: &quot;rest&quot;) or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead () or Mass of the dead (), is a Mass of the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the souls of the deceased, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is usually celebrated in the context of a funeral (where in some countries it is often called a Funeral Mass).

Musical settings of the propers of the Requiem Mass are also called Requiems, and the term has subsequently been applied to other musical compositions associated with death, dying, and mourning, even when they lack religious or liturgical relevance.

The term is also used for similar ceremonies outside the Catholic Church, especially in Western Rite Orthodox Christianity, the Anglo-Catholic tradition of Anglicanism, and in certain Lutheran churches. A comparable service, with a wholly different ritual form and texts, exists in the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches as well as some Methodist churches.

The Mass and its settings draw their name from the introit of the liturgy, which begins with the words (Latin for &quot;Eternal rest grant them, O Lord&quot;), which is cited from 2 Esdras—&quot;requiem&quot; is the accusative singular form of the Latin noun , &quot;rest, repose&quot;. The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 employs this phrase as the first entrance antiphon among the formulas for Masses for the dead, and it remains in use to this day.

==Liturgical rite==

In earlier forms of the Roman Rite, some of which are still in use, a Requiem Mass differs in several ways from the usual Mass. Some parts that were of relatively recent origin, including some that have been excluded in the 1970 revision of the regular Mass, are omitted. Examples are the psalm &quot;Iudica&quot; at the start of Mass, the prayer said by the priest before reading the Gospel (or the blessing of the deacon, if a deacon reads it), and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving Communion. Other omissions include the use of incense at the Introit and the Gospel, the kiss of peace, lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the Gospel, and blessings. There is no Gloria in excelsis Deo and no recitation of the Creed; the Alleluia chant before the Gospel is replaced by a Tract, as in Lent; and the is altered. is replaced with (May they rest in peace); the response is replaced with ; and the final blessing for the congregation is omitted. Black was the obligatory liturgical colour of the vestments in the earlier forms (including the Missal of 1962), while in the renewed liturgy &quot;the colour black may be used, where it is the practice, in Masses for the Dead&quot;. The sequence Dies irae, recited or sung between the Tract and the Gospel, was an obligatory part of the Requiem Mass before the changes as a result of the liturgical reform of the Second Vatican Council. As its opening words (&quot;Day of wrath&quot;) indicate, this poetic composition speaks of the Day of Judgment in fearsome terms; it then appeals to Jesus for mercy. In the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, commemorations (i.e. collect, secret, and postcommunion of either lower-ranking liturgical feasts that occur on the same day or votive/seasonal commemorations) are absent from the liturgy; as a result, it is standard practice for a separate, smaller Requiem Missal containing only the rubrics and various Mass formularies for Masses for the dead to be used, rather than the full Missal containing texts that will never be used at Requiems.

===Roman Rite ===

In the liturgical reforms of the mid-20th century in the Catholic Church&#x27;s Roman Rite, there was a significant shift in the funeral rites used by the Church. The theme of sorrow and grief was also made to emphasise the whole community&#x27;s worship of God in which the deceased is entrusted to God&#x27;s mercy, based on trust in the salvation value of the Passion, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.

In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the Requiem Mass was sometimes termed a &quot;Mass of the Resurrection&quot; or Mass of Christian Burial, although the former was never official terminology. In the official English ritual, &quot;Order of Christian Funerals&quot;, published by the Bishops of England and Wales in 1990, the title is given as &quot;Funeral Mass&quot;. &quot;Requiem Mass&quot; remains a suitable title for other Masses for the dead and for the Funeral Mass itself (as the proper antiphons remain in force: Introit, &quot;Eternal rest grant ... &quot; / &quot;&quot;; Offertory, &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, King of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful departed ... &quot; / &quot;&quot;; Communion, &quot;Let perpetual light shine ...&quot; / &quot;&quot;). In keeping with those trends of the latter 21st century, the use of white vestments was made an allowable option by the Missal, though only by an indult; black remains the normal colour of all Requiem Masses, including Funeral Masses. Violet, a colour of penance, was also allowed by indult, since penance and reparation for the soul, presumably in Purgatory, is encouraged by the Church. The texts used for the liturgy underwent a similar change, and some of the new options for the readings reinforce an overall theme of Jesus&#x27; promise of eternal life.
==Requiem in other rites and churches==
&quot;Requiem&quot; is also used to describe any sacred composition that sets to music religious texts which would be appropriate at a funeral, or to describe such compositions for liturgies other than the Roman Catholic Mass. Among the earliest examples of this type are the German settings composed in the 17th century by Heinrich Schütz and Michael Praetorius, whose works are Lutheran adaptations of the Roman Catholic requiem, and which provided inspiration for the &quot;German Requiem&quot; by Brahms.

Such works include:
* Greek Orthodox Church—&quot;Parastas&quot;
* Russian Orthodox Church—&quot;Panikhida&quot;
* Anglican (English) Requiem

===Eastern Christian rites===

In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the requiem is the fullest form of memorial service (, Slavonic: ). The normal memorial service is a greatly abbreviated form of Matins, but the Requiem contains all of the psalms, readings, and hymns normally found in the All-Night Vigil (which combines the Canonical Hours of Vespers, Matins and First Hour), providing a complete set of propers for the departed. The full requiem will last around three-and-a-half hours. In this format it more clearly represents the original concept of &quot;parastas&quot;, which means literally, &quot;standing throughout (the night).&quot; Often, there will be a Divine Liturgy celebrated the next morning with further propers for the departed.

Because of their great length, a full Requiem is rarely served. However, at least in the Russian liturgical tradition, a Requiem will often be served on the eve before the Glorification (canonization) of a saint, in a special service known as the &quot;Last &quot;Panikhida&quot;&quot;.

===Anglicanism===

The &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; contained no Requiem Mass, but instead a service named &quot;The Order for the Burial of the Dead&quot;. Since the liturgical reform movement, provision has been made for a Eucharist to be celebrated at a funeral in various BCPs used in the various Provinces of the Anglican Communion. Prior to these additions, Anglo-Catholics or High Church Anglicans often incorporated parts of the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass as part of a funeral service — typically passages from the Ordinary of the Mass. Within this service are several texts with rubrics stating that they should be said or sung by the priest or clerks. The first few of these texts are found at the beginning of the service, while the rest are prescribed for the burial itself. These texts are typically divided into seven, and collectively known as &quot;funeral sentences&quot;. Composers who have set the Anglican burial service to music include William Croft, Thomas Morley, Thomas Tomkins, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell. The text of these seven sentences, from the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, is as follows:
* I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. &quot;(John 11:25-26)&quot;
* I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. &quot;(Job 19:25-27)&quot;
* We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord. &quot;(1 Timothy 6:7 and Job 1:21)&quot;
* Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay. &quot;(Job 14:1-2)&quot;
* In the midst of life we are in death: of whom may we seek for succour, but of thee, O Lord, who for our sins art justly displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death. &quot;(Media vita in morte sumus)&quot;
* Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts; shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.
* I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Write, From henceforth blessed are the dead which die in the Lord: even so saith the Spirit: for they rest from their labours. &quot;(Revelation 14:13)&quot;

==Music==

The Requiem Mass is notable for the large number of musical compositions that it has inspired, including settings by Mozart (though uncompleted), Verdi, Berlioz, Saint-Saëns, Brahms (from the vernacular German Lutheran Bible), Dvořák, Fauré, Duruflé, and others. Originally, such compositions were meant to be performed in liturgical service, with monophonic chant. Eventually, the dramatic character of the text began to appeal to composers to an extent that they made the requiem a genre of its own, and the compositions of composers such as Verdi are essentially concert pieces rather than liturgical works.

Many of the texts in the Requiem Mass have been set to music, including:

* Introit
* Kyrie eleison
* Gradual
* Tract
* Sequence (the &quot;Dies Irae&quot;)
* Offertory
* Sanctus
* Agnus Dei
* Communion
* Pie Jesu
* Libera Me
* In paradisum
===History of musical compositions===

For many centuries the texts of the requiem were sung to Gregorian melodies. The Requiem by Johannes Ockeghem, written sometime in the latter half of the 15th century, is the earliest surviving polyphonic setting. There was a setting by the elder composer Dufay, possibly earlier, which is now lost: Ockeghem&#x27;s may have been modelled on it. Many early compositions reflect the varied texts that were in use in different liturgies around Europe before the Council of Trent standardised texts used in liturgies. The requiem of Brumel, circa 1500, is the first to include the &quot;Dies Iræ&quot;. In the early polyphonic settings of the Requiem, there is considerable textural contrast within the compositions themselves: simple chordal or fauxbourdon-like passages are contrasted with other sections of contrapuntal complexity, such as in the Offertory of Ockeghem&#x27;s Requiem.

In the 16th century, more and more composers set the Requiem Mass. In contrast to practice in setting the Mass Ordinary, many of these settings used a cantus-firmus technique, something which had become quite archaic by mid-century. In addition, these settings used less textural contrast than the early settings by Ockeghem and Brumel, although the vocal scoring was often richer, for example in the six-voice Requiem by Jean Richafort which he wrote for the death of Josquin des Prez. Other composers before 1550 include Pedro de Escobar, Antoine de Févin, Cristóbal Morales, and Pierre de La Rue; that by La Rue is probably the second oldest, after Ockeghem&#x27;s.
Over 2,000 Requiem compositions have been composed to the present day. Typically the Renaissance settings, especially those not written on the Iberian Peninsula, may be performed &quot;a cappella&quot; (i.e. without necessary accompanying instrumental parts), whereas beginning around 1600 composers more often preferred to use instruments to accompany a choir, and also include vocal soloists. There is great variation between compositions in how much of liturgical text is set to music.

Most composers omit sections of the liturgical prescription, most frequently the Gradual and the Tract. Fauré omits the &quot;Dies iræ&quot;, while the very same text had often been set by French composers in previous centuries as a stand-alone work.

Sometimes composers divide an item of the liturgical text into two or more movements; because of the length of its text, the &quot;Dies iræ&quot; is the most frequently divided section of the text (as with Mozart, for instance). The &quot;Introit&quot; and &quot;Kyrie&quot;, being immediately adjacent in the actual Roman Catholic liturgy, are often composed as one movement.

Musico-thematic relationships among movements within a Requiem can be found as well.

====Requiem in concert====
Beginning in the 18th century and continuing through the 19th, many composers wrote what are effectively concert works, which by virtue of employing forces too large, or lasting such a considerable duration, prevent them being readily used in an ordinary funeral service; the requiems of Gossec, Berlioz, Verdi, and Dvořák are essentially dramatic concert oratorios. A counter-reaction to this tendency came from the Cecilian movement, which recommended restrained accompaniment for liturgical music, and frowned upon the use of operatic vocal soloists.

===Modern treatments===
In the 20th century the requiem evolved in several new directions. The genre of War Requiem is perhaps the most notable, which comprise compositions dedicated to the memory of people killed in wartime. These often include extra-liturgical poems of a pacifist or non-liturgical nature; for example, the &quot;War Requiem&quot; of Benjamin Britten juxtaposes the Latin text with the poetry of Wilfred Owen, Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Polish Requiem&quot; includes a traditional Polish hymn within the sequence, and Robert Steadman&#x27;s &quot;Mass in Black&quot; intersperses environmental poetry and prophecies of Nostradamus. Holocaust Requiem may be regarded as a specific subset of this type. The &quot;Requiem Ebraico&quot; (Hebrew Requiem) (1945) by Austrian-American composer Eric Zeisl, a setting of Psalm 92 dedicated to the memory of the composer&#x27;s father &quot;and the other countless victims of the Jewish tragedy in Europe&quot;, is considered the first major work of Holocaust commemoration. John Foulds&#x27;s &quot;A World Requiem&quot; was written in the aftermath of the First World War and initiated the Royal British Legion&#x27;s annual festival of remembrance. Recent requiem works by Taiwanese composers Tyzen Hsiao and Ko Fan-long follow in this tradition, honouring victims of the February 28 Incident and subsequent White Terror.

The 20th century saw the development of the secular Requiem, written for public performance without specific religious observance, such as Max Reger&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (1915), the setting of a German poem titled Requiem and dedicated to victims of World War I, and Frederick Delius&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, completed in 1916 and dedicated to &quot;the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war&quot;; Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d: A Requiem for Those We Love&quot;, commissioned in 1945 (premiered 1946) after the passing of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and based on Walt Whitman&#x27;s elegy written after the passing of Abraham Lincoln; and Dmitry Kabalevsky&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; (Op. 72; 1962), a setting of a poem written by Robert Rozhdestvensky especially for the composition.

Herbert Howells&#x27;s unaccompanied &quot;Requiem&quot; uses Psalm 23 (&quot;The Lord is my shepherd&quot;), Psalm 121 (&quot;I will lift up mine eyes&quot;), &quot;Salvator mundi&quot; (&quot;O Saviour of the world&quot; in English), &quot;Requiem aeternam&quot; (two different settings), and &quot;I heard a voice from heaven&quot;. John Rutter combines in his Requiem (1985) some of the parts of the Latin Requiem with two complete psalms, Psalm 130 &quot;Out of the deep&quot; and his earlier composition &quot;The Lord is my Shepherd&quot;, and juxtaposes more biblical verses within the Latin movements.

Some composers have written purely instrumental works bearing the title of &quot;Requiem&quot;, as famously exemplified by Britten&#x27;s &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot;. Hans Werner Henze&#x27;s &quot;Das Floß der Medusa&quot;, written in 1968 as a requiem for Che Guevara, is properly speaking an oratorio; Henze&#x27;s Requiem is instrumental but retains the traditional Latin titles for the movements. Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Requiem Canticles&quot; mixes instrumental movements with segments of the &quot;Introit&quot;, &quot;Dies irae&quot;, &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; and &quot;Libera me&quot;.

<text>Anjouan () is an autonomous volcanic island in the Comoro Islands in the southwestern Indian Ocean, part of the Union of the Comoros. It is known in Shikomori as Ndzuani, Ndzuwani or Nzwani, and, until the early twentieth century when the name fell out of general use (although still sometimes used by English-speakers in Zanzibar), in English as Johanna. Historically it was also called Hinzuan or Hanzoan.
Its chief town is Mutsamudu and, , its population is around 277,500. The total area of the island is 424 square kilometers (163 square miles).

==History==
===Early and colonial history===
The first inhabitants of the island were Bantu-speaking peoples from eastern Africa and navigators from Indonesia and Southwest Asia. In the late fifteenth century high status Hadrami Arab immigrants married into the local ruling classes and established a sultanate that extended its control over the entire island and occasionally extending their influence to the neighboring island of Mwali and Mayotte. In 1812, Sultan Alawi bin Husain requested British assistance against Malagasy slavers who were threatening his domain, which was turned down. Nevertheless, the island remained within the British sphere of influence until the late 19th century. In 1886 France, already present in Mayotte, established a protectorate over the island; slavery was abolished in 1899, and in 1912, following the forced abdication of the last sultan, France formally annexed the island.

John Mucknell marooned his enemies on Anjouan in 1644. His ship, the &quot;John&quot;, was owned by the East India Company, but after ridding himself of opposition in this manner, he turned pirate and returned to Britain.

===Anjouan under independent Comoros===
Anjouan joined the State of Comoros when it became independent in 1975, with Ahmed Abdallah as president of the State of Comoros. The island, being a part of the country, has gone through more than 20 coups since independence and has experienced several attempts at secession.

===Secessionist/Autonomous Anjouan===
In 1997, the islands of Anjouan and Mohéli seceded from the Comoros. On 3 August 1997, Anjouan declared itself the independent State of Anjouan (&quot;État d’Anjouan&quot;) with Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim as president. An independence referendum was subsequently held in October, with over 99% voting in favour. The island then asked to be integrated again into the French Republic; but France refused. A constitution was adopted for Anjouan in a referendum on 25 February 1998.

In 1999, Anjouan had internal conflicts and on 1 August of that year, the 80-year-old Foundi Abdallah Ibrahim resigned, transferring power to a national coordinator, Said Abeid. The government was overthrown in a coup by army and navy officers on 9 August 2001. Mohamed Bacar soon rose to leadership of the junta that took over and by the end of the month he was the leader of the country. Despite two coup attempts in the following three months, including one by Abeid, Bacar&#x27;s government remained in power and was apparently more willing to negotiate with Comoros.

After the creation of the Union, the islands were reunified with Comoros in 2002 and a new Union of the Comoros constitution mandated the election of a President of Anjouan along with presidents for the other two autonomous islands and a President of the Union. Bacar was elected for a 5-year term as President of the island of Anjouan. His term expired on 14 April 2007 and the president of the assembly, Houmadi Caambi, became acting president from 15 April until he was overthrown by forces loyal to Bacar on 10 May.

Peace talks were held between the Comorian and Anjouan governments whereby they agreed to hold free elections in which Mohamed Bacar would stand. Although the Union government delayed the election - citing alleged irregularities and intimidation — Bacar unilaterally printed ballots and held an illegal election in June. The result, due to electoral fraud, was an overwhelming victory of 90 percent. In July 2007, he once again declared the island of Anjouan to be independent of the Comoros.

=== 2008 invasion of Anjouan ===
In February 2008, the Comoros rejected the African Union&#x27;s extended sanctions against Anjouan and instead opted for a military solution. In early March, the Comoros armed forces and around 400 international reinforcements from the African Union assembled on the island of Mohéli. Hostilities began on 11 March 2008, when Comorian forces staged an armed incursion on the island but diplomacy continued with an intervention by South African President Thabo Mbeki who attempted to delay the planned invasion to the distinct displeasure of the Comorian government.
There were further incursions between 14 March and 16 March 2008 and clashes between local forces loyal to Mohamed Bacar and, presumably, those from the African Union invasion force which then retreated back to Mohéli.

On 19 March 2008, a French military helicopter on a clandestine mission from French-administered Mayotte crashed in the Mozambique Channel close to the city of Sima on Anjouan. Critics of the action allege the helicopter was involved in an attempt to bring Bacar into French exile, and that Bacar was able to hold out so long only because he was protected by the French.

The main operation and, ultimately, the invasion of Anjouan began on the evening of 24 March 2008 when five boats transporting approximately 1,500 soldiers had left Mohéli on their way to Anjouan. In the early hours of 25 March 2008, an amphibious landing was made by Comoran troops supported by contingents from the African Union. The combined forces quickly advanced on the town of Ouani to secure the airfield. After the airport was secured the invasion force apparently split where part of it headed south-west to engage Anjouanais loyalists in the capital, Mutsamudu, and the remainder headed south-east capturing the port of Bambao M&#x27;Sanga and the second city of Domoni without resistance.

Mohamed Bacar managed to escape to Mayotte by 26 March to seek political asylum. He was subsequently held in custody there by the French administration and brought to the island of Réunion, where he was charged for entering French territory illegally and possession of weapons. On 15 May 2008, France rejected Bacar&#x27;s request for asylum but the French refugee office ruled that the ousted leader could not be extradited to Comoros because of the risk of persecution. France&#x27;s State Secretary for Overseas, Yves Jégo, said France would support the Comoran government&#x27;s efforts. &quot;We will continue to act in consultation with the Comoros so that the law can be applied and Colonel Bacar can be tried.&quot;

===Post-invasion Anjouan===
Following the March 2008 invasion of Anjouan, the interim president of Anjouan was Laili Zamane Abdou In May 2008, The Constitutional Court of the Comoros approved five candidates to contest the Anjouan presidential election of 15 June and invalidated the candidacy of Mohamed Bacar. Comoran President A.A. Sambi supported engineer Moussa Toybou for the position who won a bare plurality in the initial balloting. In the second round of the elections held on 29 June, he was contested by political veteran Mohamed Djaanfari but won with 52% of the vote. The Presidency of Anjouan was later transformed into the position of Governor of Anjouan.

==Geography==
Anjouan is part of the Comoros Islands located in the Mozambique Channel. It consists of the eroded remains of a large shield volcano that formed in the Pleistocene epoch. Eruptions from fissure vents spanned in three directions, followed by a long interval of erosion. Renewed volcanism produced a series of lava flows that filled deep valleys and flooded areas along the coast. The island is known for its steep, mountainous terrain and black sand beaches. Mount Ntringui is the highest point in the island of Anjouan with an elevation of above sea level. The second most important (and the most populous) city on Anjouan is Domoni. The main strategic area is the airfield at Ouani, with its 1.5 km runway, and the bay with the coastal road from the chief town Mutsamudu in the east out to the city of Sima in the west.

===Climate===
The highs on the island range from year-round. The weather is warm and humid from December to April and slightly cooler from May to November. The climate is generally much cooler in the center of the island, on the highest mountains, and generally warmer in the North-Eastern region, North of Domoni.

==Flora and fauna==

Anjouan is home to a diversity of plant life, much of which is edible. The island is abundant in cassava, bananas, mangoes, soursop, avocados, oranges, taro, and vanilla.

The Anjouan scops owl is a rare owl. The Anjouan sparrowhawk is a possibly extinct subspecies of the Frances&#x27;s goshawk. Lemurs are commonly found in the mountainous regions of the island. Two species of lizards, &quot;Flexiseps johannae&quot; and &quot;Paroedura sanctijohannis&quot;, are named after the island, and are found on the island and elsewhere in the Comoros.

===Important Bird Area===
A 6,850 ha tract encompassing the highlands of the island has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of Comoro olive pigeons, Comoro blue pigeons, Anjouan scops owls, Malagasy harriers, Madagascar brush warblers, Comoro thrushes, Anjouan sunbirds and red-headed fodies.

===Protected areas===
Mount Ntringui National Park was established in 2010, and covers an area of 79.14 km2 in the center of the island. The park includes Mount Ntringui and Mount Trindrini, Anjouan&#x27;s highest and second-highest peaks, as well as Lake Dzialandzé, Anjouan&#x27;s largest lake, and the Moya Forest, Anjouan&#x27;s largest remaining forest.

Shisiwani National Park is a marine national park, which protects the coastal waters, including coral reefs, around the Sima Peninsula. It was established in 2010, and has an area of 64.97 km2.

==Culture==

Anjouan is the island with the highest population density in Comoros. The main religion is Sunni Islam. Although the island is filled with large numbers of mosques, religious observance is not as strict as it is in many other countries observing Islam. 
The Comoros national state-owned TV station broadcasts locally. Anjouan also operates its own radio station.

===Language===
The people of Anjouan speak Shindzuani, a dialect of Shikomori. Though they have similar grammatical structures and much shared vocabulary, Shindzuani varies greatly from the dialect of the capital island, Shingazija, and linguists have debated whether they should truly be considered the same language. Public schools and government functions are carried out in French, but in daily life, Shindzuani is spoken almost exclusively. Additionally, many people living on Anjouan are fairly familiar with Arabic through language classes and the reading on the Quran from an early age. It is not uncommon for students to attend Quranic school in addition to their normal schooling.

===Clothing===
Anjouan is known for the wearing of the Shiromani, a sheet-like article of clothing women wrap around their body. The Shiromani is often red, expressing the color of the island of Anjouan.

===Cuisine===
The local cuisine has a great deal of Arab and French influence. Spices such as turmeric, cloves, and cumin are widely used. Meals common to Anjouan include fish with coconut rice, pigeon pea stew, cooked taro dishes, and cassava dishes. The cassava leaves are eaten just as commonly as the roots, cooked with coconut milk and often paired with rice as the dish &quot;Mataba&quot;. Hot peppers are also common in the form of a hot sauce called &quot;putu&quot;, which is prepared by grinding fresh peppers together on stone. Spice level and general flavor of putu greatly depending on family and region.

Different regions of Anjouan are known for producing different crops, with clove trees filling the Northeast corner of the island and the central mountainous region being rich with lychee fruit trees. Bananas, jackfruit, breadfruit, mangoes, papaya, red guava, green guava, a variety of lime, and small oranges are commonly found all over the island. Vanilla is grown by some for selling and exporting, but is not commonly consumed by Comorians themselves.

==Economy==
The island uses the Comorian franc as a currency which is printed by the Bank of France and issued by the central bank of the country, the Central Bank of the Comoros. Many people on the island farm ylang-ylang, vanilla, and cloves. The economy of the island is dependent on agriculture and related industries. These industries employ over 80% of the workforce. The island&#x27;s main food staple is rice, all of which must be imported. Anjouan is the world&#x27;s primary exporter of ylang-ylang oil, an ingredient in almost all perfumes.

===Banking system===
As part of the Union of the Comoros, the banking system of Anjouan is regulated by the Central Bank of the Comoros, created in 1981. Anjouan, pursuant to the Regulation of Banks and Comparable Establishments of 1999, licensed more than 300 offshore banks. All of the shell banks and other entities are located offshore and have no permanent presence in the Comoros. Anjouan sold the right to issue bank licenses and delegated most of its authority to operate and regulate the offshore business to private, non-Comoran domiciled parties.

In 2002, after Anjouan&#x27;s reentry into the Union of the Comoros as an autonomous island, Anjouan&#x27;s Offshore Finance Authority was established to promote the island as a tax haven to attract foreign capital.

In 2005, new laws were passed and all of the banking licenses issued there previous to that date were canceled. Those that could show proper due diligence were reset by the newly rearranged Offshore Finance Authority, monopolized by Anjouan Corporate Institution Limited (ACIL) since 2003, which has claimed the authority as registered agent for all International Business Companies and banking license issuance on the island since that time and authorized directly by the Legislative Assembly in Anjouan. The company claiming to sell licenses previous to 2003 was sued in the London High Court on behalf of the Anjouan Government and lost, The High Court of Justice in London confirmed after seeing all the legal documentation that Anjouan Corporate Institution Limited (ACIL), was legally entitled to operate the offshore business, with full consent of the Anjouan Government. All Banking Licenses were being issued as a Class B Banking License and have terms of one year, which were renewable as long as no complaint had been made against the Bank in violation of anti-money laundering regulations, fraud, or Banking laws.

The Central Bank of Comoros has never commented the Anjouan Offshore Finance Authority’s activity. At the same time, on the Central Bank website, in the section &quot;Flash News&quot; from April 4, 2014, it was mentioned: &quot;The Central Bank of Comores recalls that up to date, no license has been delivered for the exercise of financial offshore activities in one of the islands of the Union of the Comoros&quot;. So the financial licenses issued by &quot;Anjouan’s Offshore Finance Authority&quot; and &quot;Anjouan Corporate Services Limited&quot; were not taken in consideration by the authorities of the Union of Comoros.

It has been told that Anjouan authorities abandoned the development of the offshore financial sector since the summer of 2008 but, based on the orders 001-008 of 2005 of Autonomous Island of Anjouan, Anjouan’s Offshore Finance Authority is yet maintaining the possibility to make a request for the different types of licenses through their website. Currently there are nominated less than 50 institutions having the active licenses. However, the law creating non-financial offshore companies was legally adopted by the Parliament of Anjouan and non-financial firms registered in Anjouan are recognized legally.

==Government==
===Politics===
Presidential elections were held in Anjouan on 15 June following the 2008 invasion of Anjouan to oust Mohamed Bacar as President of Anjouan. About 128,000 people were eligible to vote. Mohamed Djaanfari, a former vice-president of the Assembly of the Union of the Comoros, and Moussa Toybou, a former minister in Said Mohamed Djohar&#x27;s government, advanced to the runoff round held on 29 June. The final official result, as confirmed by the constitutional court on 3 July 2008, declared Toybou the winner with 52.42% of the vote to Djaanfari&#x27;s 47.58%.

December 20, 2010 Anissi Chamsidine is elected Governor of the island of Anjouan.
He works for a full reconciliation with the Union of Comoros. To show this will, the separatist flag was dropped and replaced by a new flag with the same symbol than that of the Union of Comoros &quot;(the Moslem crescent and four stars symbolizing the four islands of the archipelago)&quot;. Henceforth the leader of the autonomous island of Anjouan is named Governor instead of President and the Commissioners instead of Ministers.

===Military===
Anjouan invested heavily in its national security under Mohamed Bacar. Main components were the Gendarmerie commanded by Commander Abdou, the younger brother of Bacar. A battalion size militia of approximately 500 backed the Gendarmerie. Since the eviction of Bacar in March 2008, the Anjouanais defence forces are led by the Government of the Union of the Comoros.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1964 was the 9th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Copenhagen, Denmark, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot; by Grethe and Jørgen Ingmann. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (DR), the contest was held at on 21 March 1964, and was hosted by Danish TV presenter Lotte Wæver.

Sixteen countries participated in the contest. made its debut this year, whereas decided not to enter.

The winner of the contest was with the song &quot;, performed by Gigliola Cinquetti, written by Nicola Salerno and composed by Mario Panzeri. At the age of 16 years and 92 days, Gigliola Cinquetti became the youngest winner of the contest yet; a record she held until . The entry had one of the widest margins of victory ever witnessed in the competition. It garnered almost three times as many points as the second-placed song.

Besides the , the 1964 contest is the only other one of which there are no surviving video recordings.

== Location ==

The host venue for the contest was (Tivoli Concert Hall) in Denmark&#x27;s capital city Copenhagen, which lies within Denmark&#x27;s famous amusement park and pleasure garden Tivoli Gardens. The park, alluding by its name to the that existed in Paris, was opened on 15 August 1843, and is the second oldest amusement park in the world, after in nearby Klampenborg.

At the night of the contest, 800 spectators followed the show in the audience.

== Participating countries ==

 did not participate this year due to a strike among members of the Swedish Union for Performing Arts and Film (). Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Radio however did ultimately broadcast the event. competed in the contest for the first time, however they became the first country to score &quot;nul points&quot; on their début entry. Germany, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia also scored &quot;nul points&quot; for the first time. The Netherlands became the first country to send a singer of non-European ancestry, Anneke Grönloh who was of Indonesian descent. Spain decided to send the Italian-Uruguayan group Los TNT who were the first group of three or more participants in the history of the contest.

Only one of the performing artists had previously competed representing the same country in past editions: Anita Traversi had represented , and had also provided backing vocals for .

== Format ==
Poul Leth Sørensen served as producer, Bent Fabricius Bjerre and Marianne Drewes acted as co-producers.

The prize to be awarded to the winning artist took the form of an engraved medallion made of silver.

The event was covered by around 100 journalists and photographers. The artists were accompanied by a 41-piece orchestra. Rehearsals started on 19 March 1964.

== Contest overview ==

The contest was held on 21 March 1964, beginning at 22:00 CET (21:00 UTC).

A political protest occurred after the Swiss entry: a man trespassed onto the stage holding a banner that read &quot;Boycott Franco &amp; Salazar&quot;. Whilst this was going on, television viewers were shown a shot of the scoreboard; once the man was removed by a television technician, the contest went on.

The interval act consisted of a ballet dance performance by dancers Solveig Østergaard, Niels Kehlet, Inge Olafsen and Mette Hønningen from the Royal Danish Ballet, choreographed by Niels Bjørn Larsen, and over the music of the &quot;Columbine porka mazurka&quot; and the &quot;Champagne Galop&quot; by Hans Christian Lumbye.

The immediate response of the Koncertsal audience to the Italian entry was markedly enthusiastic and prolonged and, most unusually for a contest performance, after leaving the stage Gigliola Cinquetti was allowed to return to take a second bow. Her performance was given an unscheduled repeat on British television the following afternoon. In the event, she won the most crushing victory in the history of the contest, with a score almost three times that of her nearest rival, a feat extremely unlikely ever to be beaten under the post-1974 scoring system.

An aftershow party was held for the participating delegations at the restaurant Ambassadeur in Copenhagen. Each of the 16 participating acts was awarded a silver trophy on this occasion.
== Detailed voting results ==
Each participating broadcaster assembled a 10-member jury panel who distributed three points among their one, two, or three favourite songs. The points were totaled and the first, second, and third placed songs were awarded 5, 3, and 1 votes in order. If only one song got every point within the jury it would get all 9 points. If only two songs were chosen, the songs would get 6 and 3 points in order.

=== 5 points ===
Below is a summary of all 5 points in the final:

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. No official accounts of the viewing figures are known to exist. Estimates given in the press ranged from 100 to 150 million viewers.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

=== Lost recordings ===
As with the , no complete video recording of the actual contest is known to have survived. Some clips of the contest have survived, including the winning announcement by Svend Pedersen, and part of Gigliola Cinquetti&#x27;s reprise. For some time, there was a rumour that a copy of the entire contest existed in the French television archives. In 2021, INA confirmed to &quot;Wiwibloggs&quot; that the French television archives do not possess a video copy of the contest. However, the audio of a French radio broadcast can be found in the archives of INA.

A persistent myth, even repeated on the official Eurovision site, is that the tape was destroyed in a fire in the 1970s. In a 2019 interview, DR claimed that the broadcast was never recorded in the first place, allegedly due to no tape machines being available at the studio at the time. The audio of most of the show, however, is still available online, without the last few minutes, and short video clips and photos from various archives also remain available.

<doc id="184804" wikidata="Q148714" url="?curid=184804" title="Jaime Escalante">
<text>Jaime Alfonso Escalante Gutiérrez (December 31, 1930 – March 30, 2010) was a Bolivian-American educator known for teaching students calculus from 1974 to 1991 at Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. Escalante was the subject of the 1988 film &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, in which he is portrayed by Edward James Olmos.

In 1993, the asteroid 5095 Escalante was named after him.

==Early life==
Escalante was born in 1930 in La Paz, Bolivia. Both of his parents were teachers. Escalante was proud of his Aymara heritage.

==Early career==
Escalante taught mathematics and physics for 12 years in Bolivia before he immigrated to the United States. He worked various jobs while teaching himself English and earning another college degree before eventually returning to the classroom as an educator.

In 1974, he began to teach at Garfield High School. Escalante was initially so disheartened by the lack of preparation of his students that he called his former employer and asked for his old job back. Escalante eventually changed his mind about returning to work when he found twelve students willing to take an algebra class.

Shortly after Escalante came to Garfield High School, its accreditation became threatened. Instead of gearing classes to poorly performing students, Escalante offered AP Calculus. He had already earned the criticism of an administrator, who disapproved of his requiring the students to answer a homework question before being allowed into the classroom: &quot;He said to &#x27;Just get them inside.&#x27; I said, &#x27;There is no teaching, no learning going on here. We are just baby-sitting.&#x27;&quot;

Determined to change the status quo, Escalante persuaded a few students that they could control their futures with the right education. He promised them that they could get jobs in engineering, electronics, and computers if they would learn math: &quot;I&#x27;ll teach you math and that&#x27;s your language. With that, you&#x27;re going to make it. You&#x27;re going to college and sit in the first row, not the back because you&#x27;re going to know more than anybody.&quot;

The school administration opposed Escalante frequently during his first few years. He was threatened with dismissal by an assistant principal because he was coming in too early, leaving too late, and failing to get administrative permission to raise funds to pay for his students&#x27; Advanced Placement tests. The opposition changed with the arrival of a new principal, Henry Gradillas. In addition to allowing Escalante to stay, Gradillas overhauled the academic curriculum at Garfield, reducing the number of basic math classes and requiring those taking basic math to take algebra as well. He denied extracurricular activities to students who failed to maintain a C average and to new students who failed basic skills tests. One of Escalante&#x27;s students remarked, &quot;If he wants to teach us that bad, we can learn.&quot;

Escalante continued to teach at Garfield and instructed his first calculus class in 1978. He recruited fellow teacher Ben Jiménez and taught calculus to five students, two of whom passed the AP calculus test. The following year, the class size increased to nine students, seven of whom passed the AP calculus test. By 1981, the class had increased to fifteen students, fourteen of whom passed. Escalante placed a high priority on pressuring his students to pass their math classes, particularly calculus. He rejected the common practice of ranking students from first to last but frequently told his students to press themselves as hard as possible in their assignments.

==National attention==
In 1982, Escalante first gained media attention when 18 of his students passed the Advanced Placement Calculus exam. The Educational Testing Service found the scores to be suspicious because they all made exactly the same math error on the sixth problem, and they also used the same unusual variable names. Fourteen of those who passed were asked to take the exam again. Twelve of them agreed to retake the test, and all did well enough to have their scores reinstated.
In 1983, the number of students enrolling and passing the calculus test more than doubled. That year, 33 students took the exam, and 30 passed. That year, he also started to teach calculus at East Los Angeles College. By 1987, 83 students passed the AB version of the exam, and another 12 passed the BC version. That was the peak for the calculus program. The same year, Gradillas went on sabbatical to finish his doctorate with hopes that he could be reinstated as principal at Garfield or a similar school with a similar program upon his return.

In 1988, a book, &quot;Escalante: The Best Teacher in America&quot; by Jay Mathews, and a film, &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, were released based on the events of 1982. Teachers and other interested observers asked to sit in on his classes. He shared with them: &quot;The key to my success with youngsters is a very simple and time-honored tradition: hard work for teacher and student alike.&quot; Escalante received visits from political leaders and celebrities, including President Ronald Reagan and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In 1990, Escalante worked with the Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education to produce the video series &quot;Futures&quot;, which won a Peabody Award.

Escalante has described the film &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; as &quot;90% truth, 10% drama.&quot; He stated that several points were left out of the film: 
* It took him several years to achieve the kind of success shown in the film.
* No student who did not know multiplication tables or fractions was ever taught calculus in a single year.
* Escalante suffered inflammation of the gallbladder, not a heart attack.

Over the next few years, Escalante&#x27;s calculus program continued to grow.

==Departure from Garfield==
In his final years at Garfield, Escalante received threats and hate mail. By 1990, he had lost the math department chairmanship. Escalante&#x27;s math enrichment program had grown to more than 400 students. His class sizes had increased to over 50 students in some cases. That was far beyond the 35 student limit set by the teachers&#x27; union, which increased its criticism of Escalante&#x27;s work. In 1991, the number of Garfield students taking advanced placement examinations in math and other subjects jumped to 570. The same year, citing faculty politics and petty jealousies, Escalante and Jiménez left Garfield. Escalante found new employment at Hiram W. Johnson High School in Sacramento, California. At the height of Escalante&#x27;s success, Garfield graduates were entering the University of Southern California in such great numbers that they outnumbered all the other high schools in the working-class East Los Angeles region combined. Even students who failed the AP exam often went on to study at California State University, Los Angeles.

Angelo Villavicencio, one of Escalante&#x27;s handpicked instructors, took over the program after Escalante&#x27;s departure, teaching the remaining 107 AP students in two classes over the following year. Sixty-seven of Villavicencio&#x27;s students went on to take the AP exam and forty-seven passed. The math program&#x27;s decline at Garfield became apparent following the departure of Escalante, Villavicencio, and other teachers associated with its inception and development. In just a few years, the number of AP calculus students at Garfield who passed their exams dropped by more than 80%. In 1996, Villavicencio contacted Garfield&#x27;s new principal, Tony Garcia, and offered to come back to help revive the dying calculus program. His offer was rejected.

==Later life==

In the mid-1990s, Escalante became a strong supporter of English-only education efforts. In 1997, he joined Ron Unz&#x27;s English for the Children initiative, which eventually ended most bilingual education in California schools.

In 2001, after many years of preparing teenagers for the AP calculus exam, Escalante returned to his native Bolivia. He lived in his wife&#x27;s hometown, Cochabamba, and taught at Universidad Privada del Valle. He returned to the United States frequently to visit his children.

In early 2010 Escalante made a final trip to the United States to pursue treatment for bladder cancer. As he faced financial difficulties from the cost of his cancer treatment, cast members from &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, including Edward James Olmos, and some of Escalante&#x27;s former pupils, raised funds to help pay for his medical bills.

==Death and legacy==
Escalante died on March 30, 2010, at his son&#x27;s home, while undergoing treatment for bladder cancer. He was 79.

On April 1, 2010, a memorial service honoring Escalante was held at the Garfield High School. Students observed a moment of silence on the front steps of the campus. A wake was also held on April 17, 2010, in a classroom at Garfield.

Escalante is buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier Lakeside Gardens. In 2016, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp in his likeness.

<text>The barangay (; abbreviated as Brgy. or Bgy.), historically referred to as &quot;barrio&quot;, is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines. Named after the precolonial polities of the same name, modern barangays are political subdivisions of cities and municipalities which are analogous to villages, districts, neighborhoods, suburbs, or boroughs. The word &quot;barangay&quot; originated from &quot;balangay&quot;, a type of boat used by a group of Austronesian peoples when they migrated to the Philippines.

All municipalities and cities in the Philippines are politically subdivided into barangays, with the exception of the municipalities of Adams in Ilocos Norte and Kalayaan in Palawan, each containing a single barangay. Barangays are sometimes informally subdivided into smaller areas called &quot;purok&quot; (), or barangay zones consisting of a cluster of houses for organizational purposes, and &quot;sitios&quot;, which are territorial enclaves—usually rural—far from the barangay center. , there are 42,004 barangays throughout the country.

== History ==
When the first Spaniards arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, they found well-organized, independent villages called &quot;barangays&quot;. The name &quot;barangay&quot; originated from &quot;balangay&quot;, a certain type of traditional boat in many languages in the Philippines. Early Spanish dictionaries of Philippine languages make it clear that &quot;balangay&quot; was pronounced &quot;ba-la-ngay&quot;, while today the modern &quot;barangay&quot; is pronounced &quot;ba-rang-gay&quot;. The term referred to the people serving under a particular chief rather than to the modern meaning of an area of land, for which other words were used. While &quot;barangay&quot; is a Tagalog word, it spread throughout the Philippines as Spanish rule concentrated power in Manila.

All citations regarding pre-colonial barangays lead to a single source, Juan de Plascencia&#x27;s 1589 report &quot;Las costumbres de los indios Tagalos de Filipinas&quot;. However, historian Damon Woods challenges the concept of a &quot;barangay&quot; as an indigenous political organization primarily due to a lack of linguistic evidence. Based on indigenous language documents, Tagalogs did not use the word &quot;barangay&quot; to describe themselves or their communities. Instead, &quot;barangay&quot; is argued to be a Spanish invention resulting from an attempt by the Spaniards to reconstruct pre-conquest Tagalog society.

The first barangays started as relatively small communities of around 50 to 100 families. By the time of contact with the Spaniards, many barangays had developed into large communities. The &quot;encomienda&quot; of 1604 shows that many affluent and powerful coastal barangays in Sulu, Butuan, Panay, Leyte, Cebu, Pampanga, Pangasinan, Pasig, Laguna, and the Cagayan River were flourishing trading centers. Some of these barangays had large populations. In Panay, some barangays had 20,000 inhabitants; in Leyte (Baybay), 15,000 inhabitants; in Cebu, 3,500 residents; in Vitis (Pampanga), 7,000 inhabitants; and in Pangasinan, 4,000 residents. There were smaller barangays with fewer people, but these were generally inland communities, or if they were coastal, they were not located in areas that were good for business pursuits. These smaller barangays had around thirty to one hundred houses only, and the population varied from 100 to 500 persons. According to Miguel López de Legazpi, he founded communities with only 20 to 30 people.

Traditionally, the original &quot;barangays&quot; were coastal settlements formed by the migration of these Malayo-Polynesian people (who came to the archipelago) from other places in Southeast Asia (&quot;see chiefdom&quot;). Most of the ancient barangays were coastal or riverine. This is because most of the people were relying on fishing for their supply of protein and their livelihood. They also traveled mostly by water, up and down rivers and along the coasts. Trails always followed river systems, which were also a major source of water for bathing, washing, and drinking.

The coastal barangays were more accessible to trade with foreigners. These were ideal places for economic activity to develop. Business with traders from other countries also meant contact with other cultures and civilizations, such as those of Japan, Han Chinese, Indians, and Arabs. These coastal communities acquired more cosmopolitan cultures with developed social structures (sovereign principalities), ruled by established royalties and nobilities.

During Spanish rule, through a resettlement policy called reductions, smaller, scattered barangays were consolidated (and thus &quot;reduced&quot;) to form compact towns. Each barangay was headed by the &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot; (barangay chief), who formed part of the &quot;principalía&quot;, the elite ruling class of the municipalities of the Spanish Philippines. This position was inherited from the first datus and came to be known as such during the Spanish regime. The Spanish monarch, who also collected taxes (called tribute) from the residents for the Spanish Crown, ruled each barangay through the &quot;cabeza&quot;.

When the Americans arrived, &quot;slight changes in the structure of local government was effected&quot;. Later, Rural Councils with four councilors were created to assist, now renamed Barrio Lieutenant; they were later renamed Barrio Council and then Barangay Council (Sangguniang Barangay).

The Spanish term &quot;barrio&quot; (abbr. Bo.) was used for much of the 20th century. Manila mayor Ramon Bagatsing established the first Barangay Bureau in the Philippines, creating the blueprint for the barangay system as the basic socio-political unit for the city in the early 1970s. This was quickly replicated by the national government, and in 1974, President Ferdinand Marcos ordered the renaming of barrios to barangays. The name survived the People Power Revolution, though older people would still use the term &quot;barrio&quot;. The Municipal Council was abolished upon the transfer of powers to the barangay system. Marcos used to call the barangay part of Philippine participatory democracy, and most of his writings involving the New Society praised the role of &quot;baranganic democracy&quot; in nation-building.

After the People Power Revolution and the drafting of the 1987 Constitution, the Municipal Council was restored, making the barangay the smallest unit of Philippine government. The first barangay elections held under the new constitution were held on March 28, 1989, under Republic Act No. 6679.

The last barangay elections were held in October 2023. The next elections will be held in December 2025.

== Organization ==

The modern barangay is headed by elected officials, the topmost being the barangay captain. The barangay captain is aided by the Sangguniang Barangay (Barangay Council), whose members, called barangay kagawad (&quot;councilors&quot;), are also elected. The barangay is often governed from its seat of local government, the barangay hall.

The council is considered a local government unit (LGU), similar to the provincial and municipal governments. The officials that make up the council are the barangay captain, seven barangay councilors, and the chairman of the Youth Council, or Sangguniang Kabataan (SK). Thus, there are eight members of the legislative council in a barangay.

The council is in session for a new solution or a resolution of bill votes, and if the counsels and the SK are at a tie, the barangay captain uses their vote. This only happens when the SK, which is sometimes stopped and continued, In the absence of an SK, the council votes for a nominated Barangay Council president, and this president is not like the League of the Barangay Councilors, which is composed of barangay captains of a municipality.

The Barangay Justice System, or Katarungang Pambarangay, is composed of members commonly known as the Lupon Tagapamayapa (justice of the peace). Their function is to conciliate and mediate disputes at the barangay level to avoid legal action and relieve the courts of docket congestion.

Barangay elections are non-partisan and are typically hotly contested. Barangay captains are elected by first-past-the-post plurality (no runoff voting). Councilors are elected by plurality-at-large voting, with the entire barangay as a single at-large district. Each voter can vote for up to seven candidates for councilor, with the winners being the seven candidates with the most votes. Typically, a ticket consists of one candidate for barangay captain and seven candidates for councilors. Elections for the post of &quot;punong barangay&quot; and the &quot;barangay kagawads&quot; are usually held every three years, starting in 2007.

A barangay tanod, or barangay police officer, is an unarmed watchman who fulfills policing functions within the barangay. The number of barangay tanods differs from one barangay to another; they help maintain law and order in the neighborhoods throughout the Philippines.

Funding for the barangay comes from their share of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), with a portion of the allotment set aside for the Sangguniang Kabataan. The exact amount of money is determined by a formula combining the barangay&#x27;s population and land area.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1965 was the 10th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 20 March 1965 in the in Naples, Italy and presented by Renata Mauro. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (RAI), the contest was held in Italy following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot; by Gigliola Cinquetti. Eighteen countries were represented at the contesta new record number of participants. Joining the sixteen countries which had participated in the previous year&#x27;s event were , who returned after a one-year absence, and , in its first-ever contest entry.

The winner was with the song &quot;, written by Serge Gainsbourg, and performed by the French singer France Gall. It was Luxembourg&#x27;s second contest victory, following the nation&#x27;s win in . The finished in second place for the fifth time, placed third, achieved its best-ever result with a fourth-place finish, and four countries received &quot;nul points&quot; and finished in joint last place. It was the first time that a pop song had won the contest, and marked the beginning of a sea change in the contest that saw it develop from an event dominated by and ballads in its early years to one more greatly associated with schlager and pop music for the remainder of the 1960s and into the 1970s and 1980s.

== Location ==

The 1965 contest took place in Naples, Italy, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot; performed by Gigliola Cinquetti. It was the first time that Italy had hosted the event. The chosen venue was the , in the Fuorigrotta suburb of the city. Part of RAI&#x27;s production centre in Naples, the auditorium was built between 1958 and 1963 and had space for an audience of around 1,000 people. Naples had been chosen by RAI as the host city due to the availability of the necessary equipment within the city&#x27;s production facilities, as well as to honour Naples&#x27; history as a center for music in Europe, including the prestige which the holds.

== Participating countries ==

A new record number of 18 countries submitted entries for the contest. returned after a one-year absence, and made its first ever appearance. For the first time in the contest&#x27;s history a competing entry was performed entirely in a language which was not the official language of that country, namely the which was performed entirely in English.

Three of the competing artists at this year&#x27;s event represented their countries for the second time: Conchita Bautista had represented , Vice Vukov had represented , and Udo Jürgens had represented .

== Production and format ==

The contest was organised and broadcast by the Italian public broadcaster (RAI). served as director, Francesco De Martino served as designer, and Gianni Ferrio served as musical director, leading 48 musicians of the RAI Orchestra. Each country was allowed to nominate their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their country&#x27;s entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. The event was presented by Renata Mauro and was overseen on behalf of the contest organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), by Miroslav Vilček as scrutineer.

The stage design within the venue had the orchestra situated in the centre, on top a transparent dais which allowed for special lighting effects to be made during the performances. Stage left was a performance area which the majority of artists used for their performances, with a backdrop featuring the Eurovision logo, while stage right was the scoreboard. The performance area was also used by Mauro in her opening and closing remarks, and introduce the competing acts. The large pipe organ within the RAI auditorium, with over 9,000 pipes, featured prominently behind the orchestra during the contest, as well as during the voting sequence when Mauro was pictured standing in front of it.

Each country, participating through a single EBU member broadcaster, was represented by one song performed by up to two people on stage. No entry was allowed to be commercially published before 10 February 1965; this caused an issue for the , &quot;Se piangi, se ridi&quot; by Bobby Solo, which had won the 15th Sanremo Music Festival on 30 January, as around 240,000 copies of the single release had been available in Italy by the cut-off date. Although a small number of the other broadcasters participating in the event raised objections to the song competing, given that RAI was hosting the event, with disqualification of the host broadcaster considered impossible, and an understanding that there was little time available to select a new song, &quot;Se piangi, se ridi&quot; was ultimately allowed to compete.

The results of the event were determined through jury voting, with the same voting system introduced for the previous year&#x27;s event retained. Each jury comprised ten individuals representing the average television viewer and radio listener; as such no individuals in the music industry, including composers, music publishers, and people employed by record companies, were able to sit on the jury. Each jury comprised twenty members, who each had three votes to award in total, which could be given to one song or divided across two or three songs. Jurors could not vote for their own country, and no abstentions were allowed. The song which was awarded the most votes received five points, the second-highest three points, and the third-highest one point. If only two songs had been awarded votes they would receive six and three points for first and second respectively, and if only one song was awarded votes they would receive nine points.

The draw to determine the running order took place on 9 February 1965 in Geneva, Switzerland. Each country&#x27;s delegation was provided a 45-minute slot to rehearse with the orchestra in the contest venue. Rehearsals commenced on 17 March 1965, kicking-off with Switzerland, with the UK, Spain, Italy, Germany and Austria also rehearsing on the first day. Rehearsals continued on 18 March for Norway, Portugal, Monaco, Sweden, France and Belgium, and on 19 March for Ireland, Denmark, Luxembourg, Finland, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. Technical rehearsals were held on 20 March, followed by two full dress rehearsals ahead of the live broadcast that evening; the second dress rehearsal was also heard by the national juries.

== Contest overview ==
The contest was held at 20 March 1965 at 22:00 (CET) and lasted 1 hour and 38 minutes. The interval act was a performance by the Italian operatic tenor Mario Del Monaco, who gave a rendition of &quot;O sole mio&quot;, although rather than singing live he mimed his performance to a previously recorded version. The prize for the winning artist and songwriters, a medallion engraved with the Eurovision logo designed by , was presented by Del Monaco.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;&quot;, written by Serge Gainsbourg and performed by the French singer France Gall. It was Luxembourg&#x27;s second contest win, following victory at the . The came in second for the fifth time, while placed third. , in fourth place, achieved its best-ever result, while four countries, namely , , and , finished in joint last place with &quot;nul points&quot;.

The contest was a tumultuous experience for Gall who, at 17 years old, was the youngest competitor at this year&#x27;s event. During rehearsals the musicians in the orchestra were less than impressed at Gall and the song, resorting to booing and whistling as a form of disrespect and protest at how fast the song was. This infuriated Gainsbourg, who insulted the orchestra and stormed out while threatening to leave Naples entirely and return to Paris, leaving Gall alone with an angry orchestra to finish the rehearsal. While the fractious relationship between Gainsbourg and the orchestra was eventually settled, this experience led to self-doubt creeping in for Gall; as Gall recounted in 2015, this led to a shaky and nervy performance during the contest itself, which she believed had tanked her chances of doing well in the contest. When she looked for support over the telephone from her then-boyfriend, the French singer Claude François, he supposedly reinforced her doubts, telling her she sang out-of-key. Ultimately, however, Gall would take the lead from the first round of votes, and retain the lead until the very end, beating the UK&#x27;s Kathy Kirby by six points. Upon her victory, before going out on stage for the award presentation and reprise performance of the winning song, Gall called François again, who broke up with her over the phone; Kirby meanwhile, who had been the pre-contest favourite to win, was upset at losing to the young Gall and supposedly stormed into the Luxembourgish delegation&#x27;s dressing room, claiming the contest had been rigged in Gall&#x27;s favour, and slapped her. Gall was subsequently in tears as she went back on stage, which were interpreted as tears of joy by the assembled press.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for its respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1965 contest are listed below.

* Dick van Bommel

== Detailed voting results ==

Jury voting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries. The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below, with voting countries listed in the order in which they presented their votes.

=== 5 points ===
The below table summarises how the maximum points available were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Luxembourg and the UK each received the maximum score from four of the voting countries; Austria, Denmark and France received two sets of maximum scores each; and Ireland, Monaco, the Netherlands and Switzerland each received one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Broadcasters competing in the event were required to relay the contest via its networks; non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue, with 20 booths ultimately constructed for the event.

For the first time the contest was broadcast by members of the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT), the counterpart of the EBU within Eastern European countries, via its Intervision network. In addition to the participating countries, the contest was reportedly broadcast in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union, with an expected global audience of 100 to 150 million. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.

== Legacy ==

The 1965 contest, and in particular its winner, has since been viewed as a monumental moment in the event&#x27;s history. Although pop music had been present in the contest in past editions, the vast majority of songs and winners had fit more into the &quot;, &quot; or ballad categories. &quot;&quot;, considered emblematic of the genre, is thus commonly referred to as the contest&#x27;s first pop winner, as well as the first winner which was more reflective of European popular music at the time, and its win had a big impact on the types of songs and performers which would be selected to compete in future contests. Following another pop winner in , the UK&#x27;s Sandie Shaw and &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, pop songs, and in particular schlager music, would go on to become a staple of future editions of the contest, with several winners from the 1970s onwards fitting into this genre.

Although past contest entries had achieved commercial success outside of their countries of origin, no previous winner had achieved the chart success that &quot;&quot; went on to accomplish in the weeks and months after the contest, reaching the top 10 in singles charts in Belgium, Finland, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland and West Germany, as well as in Argentina, French-speaking Canada, Japan and Singapore. Gall became one of Eurovision&#x27;s first breakthrough stars, and the commercial success of &quot;&quot; helped pave the way for the contest to be seen as a platform to drive forward professional careers and achieve commercial success across Europe and worldwide.

Gall and Gainsbourg, who had first developed a creative partnership in 1964 with &quot; (&quot;), continued to work together after the contest, spawning further hits including the controversial &quot; (&quot;); although on the surface a song about a girl who likes lollipops, just as with &quot; Gainsbourg&#x27;s lyrics were laced with subtext, in this case double meanings about fellatio. Although Gall claimed that she was too young to understand this when she recorded it, it dented her artistic image and led to a rift between herself and Gainsbourg and her career soon dipped. Upon meeting her future husband, the French singer Michel Berger her career had a resurgence, and she only performed songs written by him in future years. This partnership led to her most successful album, &quot;Babacar&quot;, in 1987, which featured &quot;&quot;, which became a worldwide hit the same year. The ending of her previous relationship with Claude François would serve as inspiration for his 1967 song &quot;&quot;; Paul Anka would subsequently buy the rights to adapt the song into English, which would eventually become &quot;My Way&quot;, a hit song for Frank Sinatra in 1969.

Gainsbourg returned to the contest two times as a songwriter: in 1967 he contributed another song, &quot;Boum-Badaboum&quot;, which represented at that year&#x27;s contest where it was performed by Minouche Barelli and finished in fifth place; and in his song &quot;White and Black Blues&quot; performed by Joëlle Ursull came second for . Also a singer, Gainsbourg gained notoriety himself in 1969 with his song &quot;, a duet with his then-girlfriend Jane Birkin, which although a commercial success was controversial for its overly sexual content, leading it to be banned from radio play in several countries and denounced by the Vatican.

&quot; was subsequently nominated in 2005 to compete in &quot;&quot;, a special broadcast to determine the contest&#x27;s most popular entry of its first 50 years as part of the contest&#x27;s anniversary celebrations. One of 14 entries chosen to compete, &quot;&quot; ultimately finished in fourteenth place.

Although the contest had no specific rules about the language in which a song should be performed in, there was an implicit understanding that each country should perform in the language, or one of the languages of that country. While some previous entries had been partly performed in a foreign language to that country, e.g. the and , which had one verse each in French, and the , which had one verse in English, the Swedish entry at this year&#x27;s entry was the first song to be performed entirely in a language other than that of the country it represented, in this case completely in English. This led to protest from several of the other broadcasters following the event, which led to a rule change being implemented for the 1966 contest, explicitly stating that all countries had to be represented by a song in one of that country&#x27;s official languages. This language rule would remain until , when freedom of language was once again permitted, only to be reintroduced ahead of the ; the rule was finally abolished indefinitely for the and all future contests.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1966 was the 11th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Poupée de cire, poupée de son&quot; by France Gall. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (CLT), the contest was held at the Villa Louvigny on 5 March 1966 and was hosted by Luxembourgish television presenter Josiane Chen.

Eighteen countries participated in the contest, the same that had competed the year before.

The winner was with the song &quot;&quot;, performed and composed by Udo Jürgens, and written by Jürgens and Thomas Hörbiger. This was Udo Jürgens third consecutive entry in the contest, finally managing to score a victory for his native country. Austria would not go on to win again until the edition. This was also the first winning song to be performed in German. The contest is also noted for its historic results for several countries. Austria who came first, who came second, who came third and who came fourth all achieved their best results up until then, some of which would stand for several decades. In contrast, traditional Eurovision heavyweights such as , , and all achieved their worst result by far up till that point, with the general public in the aforementioned countries meeting these results with a degree of consternation.

The rule stating that a country could only sing in any of its national languages was created this year, possibly due to the which was sung in English.

== Location ==

The 1966 Eurovision Song Contest was hosted in Luxembourg City. The venue chosen to host the 1966 contest was the Villa Louvigny, which was also the venue for the edition. The building served as the headquarters of , the forerunner of RTL Group. It is located in Municipal Park, in the quarter of the centre of the city.

== Participating countries ==


The same 18 countries which had participated in the previous year&#x27;s event returned for a second consecutive contest.

The event featured two artists which had previously competed in the contest for their countries: Udo Jürgens made a third consecutive appearance in the contest, after previously representing and ; and Domenico Modugno also participated in the contest a third time, after representing and . Also notable among the participants was Milly Scott, representing the , who was the first black singer to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest.

== Production and format ==
The contest was organised and broadcast by CLT. The same production team which had worked on the 1962 contest returned to help stage this event, with Jos Pauly and René Steichen serving as producers and directors and Jean Roderès serving as musical director. Each participating broadcaster was allowed to appoint their own musical director to lead the orchestra during the performance of their entry, with the host musical director also conducting for those countries which did not nominate their own conductor. The contest was presented by Josiane Shen.

Following the confirmation of the eighteen competing countries, the draw to determine the running order of the contest was held on 13 January 1966.

A new change in rules was introduced this year, allowing music experts to be present in the juries again.

This was one of the first contests in which an entry was not accompanied by an orchestra. The Italian entry &quot;&quot; performed by Domenico Modugno had been rearranged since its performance at the Sanremo Music Festival and officially broke the EBU rule that stated the arrangement should be finalised well in advance. During the Saturday afternoon rehearsal Modugno performed the new arrangement with three of his own musicians as opposed to the orchestra, which went over the three-minute time limit. Following his rehearsal Modugno was confronted by the show&#x27;s producers about exceeding the time limit and was asked to use the original arrangement with the orchestra. Modugno was so dissatisfied with the orchestra that he threatened to withdraw from the contest. Both the producers and EBU scrutineer Clifford Brown felt it was too short notice to fly Gigliola Cinquetti to Luxembourg to represent Italy, so the EBU gave in and allowed Modugno to use his own ensemble instead of the orchestra. Despite websites and the official programme listing Angelo Giacomazzi as the conductor, Giacomazzi actually played the piano for the entry.

The contest was held at 5 March 1966 at 22:00 (CET) and lasted 1 hour and 27 minutes. The interval act was a performance by the French Dixieland jazz group . The prize for the winning artist and songwriters, a medallion engraved with the Eurovision logo designed by , was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artist France Gall.

=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson, connected to the contest venue via telephone lines and responsible for announcing, in English or French, the votes for their respective country. Known spokespersons at the 1966 contest are listed below.
* Frank Hall
* Camillo Felgen

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers.

The contest was reportedly broadcast in 25 countries, including in the participating countries and Morocco; and in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and the Soviet Union via Intervision; with an estimated global audience of 500 million viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1967 was the 12th edition of the annual Eurovision Song Contest. It took place in Vienna, Austria, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;&quot; by Udo Jürgens. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster (ORF), the contest was held at the on 8 April 1967, becoming the first contest held in the month of April, and was hosted by Austrian actress Erica Vaal.

Seventeen countries participated in the contest, one fewer than the record eighteen that had competed in the and editions. decided not to enter and left the contest at this point, not returning until .

The won the contest for the first time with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;, written and composed by Bill Martin and Phil Coulter, and performed by Sandie Shaw. The entry had one of the widest margins of victory ever witnessed in the competition; it garnered more than twice as many points as the second-placed song. Shaw intensely disliked the composition, though her attitude towards the song somewhat mellowed in later years, even releasing a new version in 2007.

This was the last contest to be transmitted only in black and white as it would begin to be transmitted in colour from the edition onwards.

== Location ==

The 1967 Eurovision Song Contest was held in Vienna, the capital of Austria. The venue for the contest was the Festival Hall of the Hofburg Palace, which was the principal winter residence of the Habsburg dynasty, rulers of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It currently serves as the official residence of the President of Austria.

== Participating countries ==

Denmark chose not to participate this year and left the contest at this point, not to be returning again until 1978. The reason was that the new director for the TV entertainment department at DR thought that the money could be spent in a better way.

The contest featured three representatives who had previously performed as lead artists for the same country. Claudio Villa had represented , Kirsti Sparboe had represented , and Raphael had represented .

The entry from Luxembourg, &quot;&quot;, sung by Vicky Leandros, came in fourth; nonetheless, it went on to become one of the biggest hits of the 1967 contest, and a year later would be a big instrumental hit for French musician, Paul Mauriat, under the English title, &quot;Love Is Blue&quot;. Portugal was represented by Eduardo Nascimento, who was the first black male singer in the history of the contest; rumours claimed that Portuguese prime minister Salazar had chosen this particular singer to show the rest of Europe that he was not racist. After winning the Festival di Sanremo 1967, Italian participant Claudio Villa was due to perform the song &quot;, but the song was disqualified due to being commercially released too early, and was replaced with &quot;.

== Format ==
The stage setup was a little unusual this year. There was a staircase in the middle of the stage as well as two revolving mirrored walls on both ends of the stage; they began revolving at the start of each song, and stopped at its end. A change in rule also required half of every nation&#x27;s jury to be less than 30 years old.

The presenter Erica Vaal became confused whilst the voting was taking place, and declared the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry to be the winner before the last country, , had announced its votes. She also ended the programme by congratulating the winning song and country, and saying &quot;goodbye&quot; in several different languages.

== Contest overview ==

The contest took place on 8 April 1967, beginning at 22:00 CET.
=== Spokespersons ===
Each participating broadcaster appointed a spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for its respective country via telephone. Known spokespersons at the 1967 contest are listed below.
* Gay Byrne
* 
* Michael Aspel

== Detailed voting results ==

The voting sequence was one of the more chaotic in Eurovision history; the students from Vienna University who were operating the scoreboard made several errors during the telecast, which were corrected by the scrutineer. Hostess Erica Vaal also began to announce the winner before realising she had excluded the Irish jury.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay the contest via its networks. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. Reports estimated the global viewership to be 150 to 350 million viewers.

Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators are shown in the tables below. In addition to the participating countries, the contest was also reportedly broadcast in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Poland and the Soviet Union via Intervision.

<doc id="184810" wikidata="Q1089572" url="?curid=184810" title="Simple Service Discovery Protocol">
<text>The Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) is a network protocol based on the Internet protocol suite for advertisement and discovery of network services and presence information. It accomplishes this without assistance of server-based configuration mechanisms, such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) or Domain Name System (DNS), and without special static configuration of a network host. SSDP is the basis of the discovery protocol of Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and is intended for use in residential or small office environments. It was formally described in an IETF Internet Draft by Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard in 1999. Although the IETF proposal has since expired (April, 2000), SSDP was incorporated into the UPnP protocol stack, and a description of the final implementation is included in UPnP standards documents.

==Protocol transport and addressing==
SSDP is a text-based protocol based on HTTPU, which uses UDP as the underlying transport protocol. Services are announced by the hosting system with multicast addressing to a specifically designated IP multicast address at UDP port number 1900. In IPv4, the multicast address is and SSDP over IPv6 uses the address set for all scope ranges indicated by .

This results in the following &quot;well-known&quot; practical multicast addresses for SSDP:
* (IPv4 site-local address)
* (IPv6 link-local)
* (IPv6 site-local)
Additionally, applications may use the source-specific multicast addresses derived from the local IPv6 routing prefix, with group ID &quot;c&quot; (decimal 12).

SSDP uses the HTTP method &quot;NOTIFY&quot; to announce the establishment or withdrawal of services (presence) information to the multicast group. A client that wishes to discover available services on a network uses method &quot;M-SEARCH&quot;. Responses to such search requests are sent via unicast addressing to the originating address and port number of the multicast request.

Microsoft&#x27;s IPv6 SSDP implementations in Windows Media Player and Server use the link-local scope address. Microsoft uses port number 2869 for event notification and event subscriptions. However, early implementations of SSDP also used port 5000 for this service.

==DDoS attack==
In 2014 it was discovered that SSDP was being used in DDoS attacks known as an &quot;SSDP reflection attack with amplification&quot;. Many devices, including some residential routers, have a vulnerability in the UPnP software that allows an attacker to get replies from port number 1900 to a destination address of their choice. With a botnet of thousands of devices, the attackers can generate sufficient packet rates and occupy bandwidth to saturate links, causing the denial of services. The network company Cloudflare has described this attack as the &quot;Stupidly Simple DDoS Protocol&quot;.

== Firefox vulnerability ==
Firefox for Android prior to version 79 did not properly validate the schema of the URL received in SSDP and were vulnerable to remote code execution. An attacker on the same network could create a malicious server pretending to be a device supporting casting, but instead of a configuration file it would return an codice_1 URL. Firefox would launch the intent (if it was supported by the device) and thus would execute arbitrary code. This is not a bug with SSDP, just an improper validation performed by Firefox casting service.
