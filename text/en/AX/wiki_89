<text>Pobol y Cwm (&quot;People of the Valley&quot;; ) is a Welsh-language soap opera produced by the BBC since October 1974. The longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC, &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; was originally transmitted on BBC Cymru (now BBC One Wales) and later transferred to the Welsh-language station S4C when it opened in November 1982.

The programme typically centres around the residents of Cwmderi – a fictional, Welsh speaking, agricultural community. Its original working title was &quot;Pentrefelin&quot;.

Apart from rugby and football specials, &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; is consistently one of the most watched programmes of the week on S4C. On 25 September 2019, the soap hit a significant broadcasting landmark when it aired its 8,000th episode. On 16 October 2024, the show celebrated its 50th anniversary with an extended-length episode. In addition, the set was opened to the public with tours available around the studios and the main high street.

== Setting ==
The setting for the show is the fictional village of Cwmderi, located in Gwendraeth Valley, which is between Carmarthen and Llanelli in south-west Wales. Whilst much of the show&#x27;s early activity took place at a nursing home, storylines are currently centred on the village pub, Y Deri, and its adjacent small businesses and houses. Other frequent settings for storylines include the comprehensive school, Ysgol y Mynach, and a local farm, Penrhewl. There are two other fictional villages close to Cwmderi, named Llanarthur and Cwrtmynach.

Originally filmed at Broadcasting House, Cardiff, since 2011 the programme has been filmed at the BBC&#x27;s drama studios at Roath Lock in Cardiff Bay, other than a few on-location shoots around Cardiff. The exterior outdoor high street of Cwmderi was recreated from scratch, while many interiors are shot inside the Roath Lock Studios. The old set, on the BBC site in Llandaff, was eventually dismantled in 2017.

==Broadcast==
Three episodes are produced each week, broadcast at 8pm between Tuesdays and Thursdays, a reduction from a fifth episode in 2019, and a reduction from a fourth episode in 2021. In addition, a weekly omnibus with in-vision English subtitles airs on Sunday evenings.

On 18 March 2020 it was announced that filming would be suspended in the light of the spread of COVID-19 until further notice. The number of episodes being broadcast would be also be reduced to two per week &quot;so that we can ensure the audience can continue to enjoy Pobol y Cwm in their homes for as long as possible.&quot; The episodes were shown on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the usual time slot. In June 2020, it was announced that &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; would go on a transmission break following the broadcast on 16 June 2020. A behind-the-scenes show, &quot;Pobol y Cwm: Y Cymeriadau&quot;, aired in the show&#x27;s place during the transmission break. Every episode featured an exclusive interview with the show&#x27;s cast, with 12 episodes being shown. The soap also aired a repeat of &quot;iconic&quot; episodes from the past.

Five months later, it was confirmed that there were plans for a return to production. When production recommenced, social distancing measures were utilised and the cast were required to do their own hair and make-up, which is normally done by a make-up artist. Filming recommenced on 10 August 2020, with new episodes airing twice a week from 8 September 2020, increasing to four in January 2021.

===Outside of Wales===
For a brief period in 1992, the series was broadcast at a 7pm slot on Nederland 3, under the title &quot;De vallei&quot; (The Valley). The British producers commissioned a promotional tape featuring facets of Welsh culture, preceding the first episode broadcast by the channel on 11 August 1992.

In 1994, it was briefly shown across the rest of the United Kingdom on BBC Two with English subtitles. This networked run started on 10 January 1994, in a daily afternoon slot four times a week from Monday to Thursday for about three months on an &quot;experimental basis&quot;. However, this was not the first time it was shown outside of Wales as the programme was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. The episodes were nine months behind the Welsh broadcast. The run was preceded by an introductory programme about the series which was aired on 6 January. The final episode to air on BBC Two was broadcast on 15 April.

<text>Risperidone, sold under the brand name Risperdal among others, is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as aggressive and self-injurious behaviors associated with autism spectrum disorder. It is taken either by mouth or by injection (i.e., subcutaneous or intramuscular). The injectable versions are long-acting and last for 2–4 weeks.
Common side effects include weight gain, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, elevated prolactin levels, and restlessness. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, an increased risk of suicide, and high blood sugar levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of death. It is unknown if it is safe for use in pregnancy. Its mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but is believed to be related to its action as a dopamine and serotonin antagonist.
Study of risperidone began in the late 1980s and it was approved for sale in the United States in 1993. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 183rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Risperidone is mainly used for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism.

===Schizophrenia===
Risperidone is effective in treating psychogenic polydipsia and the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia.

Studies evaluating the utility of risperidone by mouth for maintenance therapy have reached varying conclusions. A 2012 systematic review concluded that evidence is strong that risperidone is more effective than all first-generation antipsychotics other than haloperidol, but that evidence directly supporting its superiority to placebo is equivocal. A 2011 review concluded that risperidone is more effective in relapse prevention than other first- and second-generation antipsychotics with the exception of olanzapine and clozapine. A 2016 Cochrane review suggests that risperidone reduces the overall symptoms of schizophrenia, but firm conclusions are difficult to make due to very low-quality evidence. Data and information are scarce, poorly reported, and probably biased in favour of risperidone, with about half of the included trials developed by drug companies. The article raises concerns regarding the serious side effects of risperidone, such as parkinsonism. A 2011 Cochrane review compared risperidone with other atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine for schizophrenia:

Long-acting injectable formulations of antipsychotic drugs provide improved compliance with therapy and reduce relapse rates relative to oral formulations. The efficacy of risperidone long-acting injection appears to be similar to that of long-acting injectable forms of first-generation antipsychotics.

===Bipolar disorder===
Second-generation antipsychotics, including risperidone, are effective in the treatment of manic symptoms in acute manic or mixed exacerbations of bipolar disorder. In children and adolescents, risperidone may be more effective than lithium or valproate, but has more metabolic side effects. As maintenance therapy, long-acting injectable risperidone is effective for the prevention of manic episodes but not depressive episodes. The long-acting injectable form of risperidone may be advantageous over long-acting first-generation antipsychotics, as it is better tolerated (fewer extrapyramidal effects) and because long acting injectable formulations of first-generation antipsychotics may increase the risk of depression.

===Autism===
Compared to placebo, risperidone treatment reduces certain problematic behaviors in autistic children, including aggression toward others, self-injury, challenging behavior, and rapid mood changes. The evidence for its efficacy appears to be greater than that for alternative pharmacological treatments. Weight gain is an important adverse effect. Some authors recommend limiting the use of risperidone and aripiprazole to those with the most challenging behavioral disturbances to minimize the risk of drug-induced adverse effects. Evidence for the efficacy of risperidone in autistic adolescents and young adults is less persuasive.

===Dementia===
While antipsychotic medications such as risperidone have a slight benefit in people with dementia, they have been linked to a higher incidence of death and stroke. Because of this increased risk of death, treatment of dementia-related psychosis with risperidone is not FDA-approved and carries a black box warning. However, many other jurisdictions regularly use it to control severe aggression and psychosis in those with dementia when other non-pharmacological interventions have failed and their pharmaceutical regulators have approved its use in this population.

===Other uses===
Risperidone has demonstrated clinical benefit as an augmentation agent in the management of (unipolar) non-psychotic treatment-resistant depression alongside antidepressant treatment. Atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are among the most common augments for antidepressant therapy. Such usage occurs off-label in most jurisdictions and the risk of adverse effects (e.g., weight gain, movement disorders) must be carefully weighed against the clinical benefit.

Risperidone has shown promise in treating therapy-resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder, when serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone are not sufficient.

Risperidone has proven to be effective in treatment with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), especially in cases of aggression or with another mental condition.

Risperidone has not demonstrated a benefit in the treatment of eating disorders or personality disorders, except for limited evidence in schizotypal personality disorder.

=== Available forms ===
Available forms of risperidone include tablet, orally dissolving tablet, oral solution, and powder and solvent for injection.

==Adverse effects==
Common side effects include movement problems, sleepiness, dizziness, trouble seeing, constipation, and increased weight. About 9 to 20% of people gained more than 7% of the baseline weight depending on the dose. Serious side effects may include the potentially permanent movement disorder tardive dyskinesia, as well as neuroleptic malignant syndrome, an increased risk of suicide, and high blood sugar levels. In older people with psychosis as a result of dementia, it may increase the risk of death.

While atypical antipsychotics appear to have a lower rate of movement problems as compared to typical antipsychotics, risperidone has a high risk of movement problems among the atypicals. Atypical antipsychotics, however, are associated with a greater amount of weight gain and other metabolic side effects.

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotic treatment to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse.

===Dementia===
Older people with dementia-related psychosis are at a higher risk of death.

==Interactions==
* Carbamazepine and other enzyme inducers may reduce plasma levels of risperidone. If a person is taking both carbamazepine and risperidone, the dose of risperidone will likely need to be increased. The new dose should not be more than twice the patient&#x27;s original dose.
* CYP2D6 inhibitors, such as SSRI medications, may increase plasma levels of risperidone and those medications.
* Since risperidone can cause hypotension, its use should be monitored closely when a patient is also taking antihypertensive medicines to avoid severe low blood pressure.
* Risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone are reduced in efficacy by P-glycoprotein inducers such as St John&#x27;s wort.
* Risperidone has been found to dose-dependently block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Risperidone has been classified as a &quot;qualitatively atypical&quot; antipsychotic agent with a relatively low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (when given at low doses) that has more pronounced serotonin antagonism than dopamine antagonism. Risperidone contains the functional groups of benzisoxazole and piperidine as part of its molecular structure. Although not a butyrophenone, it was developed with the structures of benperidol and ketanserin as a basis. It has actions at several 5-HT (serotonin) receptor subtypes. These are 5-HT2C, linked to weight gain, and 5-HT2A, linked to its antipsychotic action and relief of some of the extrapyramidal side effects experienced with typical antipsychotics.

It has been found that -amino acid oxidase, the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of -amino acids (e.g. -alanine and -serine — the neurotransmitters) is inhibited by risperidone.

Risperidone acts on the following receptors:

Dopamine receptors: This drug is an antagonist of the D1 (D1, and D5) as well as the D2 (D2, D3 and D4) family receptors, with 70-fold selectivity for the D2 family. It has &quot;tight binding&quot; properties, which means it has a long half-life. Like other antipsychotics, risperidone blocks the mesolimbic pathway, the prefrontal cortex limbic pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway in the central nervous system. Risperidone may induce extrapyramidal side effects, akathisia and tremors, which is associated with diminished dopaminergic activity in the striatum. It can also cause sexual side effects, galactorrhoea, infertility, gynecomastia, and, with chronic use, reduced bone mineral density leading to breaks, all of which are associated with increased prolactin secretion.

Alpha α1 adrenergic receptors: This action accounts for the orthostatic hypotensive effects and perhaps some of the sedating effects of risperidone.

Alpha α2 adrenergic receptors: Risperidone&#x27;s action at these receptors may cause greater positive, negative, affective, and cognitive symptom control.

Histamine H1 receptors: effects on these receptors account for its sedation and reduction in vigilance. This may also lead to drowsiness and weight gain.

Voltage-gated sodium channels: Because it accumulates in synaptic vesicles, Risperidone inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels at clinically used concentrations.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Risperidone undergoes hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. Lower doses are recommended for patients with severe liver and kidney disease. The active metabolite of risperidone, paliperidone, is also used as an antipsychotic.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
Risperidone was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1993 for the treatment of schizophrenia. In 2003, the FDA approved risperidone for the short-term treatment of the mixed and manic states associated with bipolar disorder. In 2006, the FDA approved risperidone for the treatment of irritability in autistic children and adolescents. The FDA&#x27;s decision was based in part on a study of autistic people with severe and enduring problems of violent meltdowns, aggression, and self-injury; risperidone is not recommended for autistic people with mild aggression and explosive behavior without an enduring pattern. On 22 August 2007, risperidone was approved as the only drug agent available for the treatment of schizophrenia in youths, ages 13–17; it was also approved that same day for the treatment of bipolar disorder in youths, ages 10–17, joining lithium.

On 16 December 2021, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) formally recommended market authorization for Okedi, a long-acting depot injection of risperidone. Okedi was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults for whom the tolerability and effectiveness of risperidone had already been established using an oral formulation. Long-acting depot injectable risperidone was approved for medical use in the European Union in February 2022.

=== Lawsuits ===
In April 2012, Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc. were fined $1.2 billion for downplaying multiple risks associated with risperidone. The verdict was later reversed by the Arkansas state supreme court.

In August 2012, J&amp;J agreed to pay $181 million to 36 US states to settle claims that it had promoted risperidone and paliperidone for off-label uses including for dementia, anger management, and anxiety.

In November 2013, J&amp;J was fined $2.2 billion for illegally marketing risperidone for use in people with dementia and paying kickbacks to prescribing physicians and nursing home pharmacies.

In 2015, Steven Brill wrote an investigative journalism piece about J&amp;J in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; focused on J&amp;J&#x27;s marketing of risperidone.

J&amp;J has faced numerous civil lawsuits on behalf of children who were prescribed risperidone who grew breasts (a condition called gynecomastia); as of July 2016 there were about 1,500 cases in Pennsylvania state court in Philadelphia, and there had been a February 2015 verdict against J&amp;J with $2.5 million awarded to a man from Alabama, a $1.75 million verdict against J&amp;J that November, and in 2016 a $70 million verdict against J&amp;J. In October 2019, a jury ordered J&amp;J to pay $8 billion in punitive damages to a Pennsylvania man who had grown breasts during adolescence. This verdict amount chosen by the jury was reduced more than 1,000-fold by a judge in January 2020, with the new punitive damages being $6.8 million. A legal scholar commented that punitive damages which exceed the compensatory damages by a factor of 10 or more in cases of this type are usually found to be legally invalid.

=== Brand names ===
Janssen&#x27;s patent on risperidone expired in December 2003, opening the market for cheaper generic versions from other companies, and Janssen&#x27;s exclusive marketing rights expired in June 2004 (the result of a pediatric extension). It is available under many brand names worldwide.

Risperidone is available as a tablet, an oral solution, and an ampule, which is a depot injection.

Brand names include Risperdal, Risperdal Consta, Risperdal M-Tab, Risperdal Quicklets, Risperlet, Okedi, and Perseris.

<text>Quetiapine, sold under the brand name Seroquel among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, and major depressive disorder. Despite being widely prescribed as a sleep aid due to its tranquillizing effects, the benefits of such use may not outweigh the risk of undesirable side effects. It is taken orally.
Common side effects include sedation, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and dry mouth. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, seizures, a prolonged erection, high blood sugar, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Quetiapine is believed to work by blocking a number of receptors, including those for serotonin and dopamine.
Quetiapine was developed in 1985 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the most prescribed antipsychotic and 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. 

The drug is typically indicated to have superior efficacy over other existing antipsychotics for the treatment of bipolar disorder, followed by olanzapine and aripiprazole, in that order. Quetiapine is currently one of only two antipsychotics (the other being cariprazine) that produce equal efficacy as a standalone therapy for mixed manic-depressive mood swings as it is when used in combination with an SSRI antidepressant. However, quetiapine is less potent than clozapine, amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone, respectively, in alleviating psychotic symptoms or treating schizophrenia.

==Medical uses==

Quetiapine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Quetiapine targets both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

===Schizophrenia===
A 2013 Cochrane review compared quetiapine to typical antipsychotics: 
In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, quetiapine demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine and approximately as effective as haloperidol and aripiprazole.

There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life.

It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are more effective. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. While quetiapine has lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, there is greater sleepiness and rates of dry mouth.

A Cochrane review comparing quetiapine to other atypical antipsychotic agents tentatively concluded that it may be less efficacious than olanzapine and risperidone; produce fewer movement related side effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine; and produce weight gain similar to risperidone, clozapine and aripiprazole. They concluded that it produces suicide attempt, suicide; death; QTc prolongation, low blood pressure; tachycardia; sedation; gynaecomastia; galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and white blood cell count at a rate similar to first generation antipsychotics.

===Bipolar disorder===
In those with bipolar disorder, quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes; acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium; valproate or lamotrigine); acute mixed episodes; and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex).

===Major depressive disorder===
Quetiapine is effective when used by itself and when used along with other medications in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, sedation is often an undesirable side effect.

In the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (while not subsidised by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for treatment of MDD), quetiapine is licensed for use as an add-on treatment in MDD.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Quetiapine does not decrease agitation among people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Quetiapine worsens intellectual functioning in the elderly with dementia and therefore is not recommended.

===Insomnia===
The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. A 2022 network meta-analysis of 154 double-blind, randomized controlled trials of drug therapies vs. placebo for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine did not demonstrate any short-term benefits in sleep quality. Quetiapine, specifically, had an effect size (standardized mean difference) against placebo for treatment of insomnia of 0.05 (95% –1.21 to 1.11) at 4weeks of treatment, with the certainty of evidence rated as very low. Doses of quetiapine used for insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800mg, with low doses of 25 to 200mg being the most typical. Regardless of the dose used, some of the more serious adverse effects may still possibly occur at the lower dosing ranges, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia. These safety concerns at low doses are corroborated by Danish observational studies that showed use of specifically low-dose quetiapine (prescriptions filled for tablet strengths &gt;50 mg were excluded) was associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to use of Z-drugs, with most of the risk being driven by cardiovascular death. Laboratory data from an unpublished analysis of the same cohort also support the lack of dose-dependency of metabolic side effects, as new use of low-dose quetiapine was associated with a risk of increased fasting triglycerides at 1-year follow-up.

===Others===

It is sometimes used off-label, often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as Tourette syndrome, musical hallucinations and anxiety disorders.

Quetiapine and clozapine are the most widely used medications for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease psychosis due to their relatively low extrapyramidal side-effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g. agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine&#x27;s use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine.

==Adverse effects==
Sources for incidence lists:

;Very common (&gt;10% incidence) adverse effects
* Dry mouth
* Dizziness
* Headache
* Somnolence (drowsiness; of 15 antipsychotics quetiapine causes the 5th most sedation. Extended release (XR) formulations tend to produce less sedation, dose-by-dose, than the immediate release formulations.)

;Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects

* High blood pressure
* Orthostatic hypotension
* High pulse rate
* High blood cholesterol
* Elevated serum triglycerides
* Abdominal pain
* Constipation
* Increased appetite
* Vomiting
* Increased liver enzymes
* Backache
* Asthenia
* Insomnia
* Lethargy
* Tremor
* Agitation
* Nasal congestion
* Pharyngitis
* Fatigue
* Pain
* Dyspepsia (Indigestion)
* Peripheral oedema
* Dysphagia

* Extrapyramidal disease: Quetiapine and clozapine are noted for their relative &quot;lack&quot; of extrapyramidal side effects.
* Weight gain: SMD 0.43 kg when compared to placebo. Produces roughly as much weight gain as risperidone, less weight gain than clozapine, olanzapine and zotepine and more weight gain than ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole and asenapine. As with many other atypical antipsychotics, this action is likely due to its actions at the H1 histamine receptor and 5-HT2C receptor.

;Rare (&lt;1% incidence) adverse effects

* Prolonged QT interval (had an odds ratio for prolonging the QT interval over placebo of 0.17)
* Sudden cardiac death
* Syncope
* Diabetic ketoacidosis
* Restless legs syndrome
* Hyponatraemia, low blood sodium.
* Jaundice, yellowing of the eyes, skin and mucous membranes due to an impaired ability of the body to clear bilirubin, a by product of haem breakdown.
* Pancreatitis, pancreas swelling.
* Agranulocytosis, a potentially fatal drop in white blood cell count.
* Leukopenia, a drop in white blood cell count, not as severe as agranulocytosis.
* Neutropenia, a drop in neutrophils, the cell of the immune cells that defends the body against bacterial infections.
* Eosinophilia
* Anaphylaxis, a potentially fatal allergic reaction.
* Seizure
* Hypothyroidism, underactive thyroid gland. Common among bipolar patients; quetiapine increases incidence.
* Myocarditis, swelling of the myocardium.
* Cardiomyopathy
* Hepatitis, swelling of the liver.
* Suicidal ideation
* Priapism. A prolonged and painful erection.
* Stevens–Johnson syndrome. A potentially fatal skin reaction.

* Neuroleptic malignant syndrome a rare and potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. It is characterised by the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mental status changes (e.g. confusion), etc.
* Tardive dyskinesia. A rare and often irreversible neurological condition characterised by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips and rest of the body. Most commonly occurs after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics. It is believed to be particularly uncommon with atypical antipsychotics, especially quetiapine and clozapine

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.

Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, risperidone, thioridazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole.

As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the seizure threshold, and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as bupropion.

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
Placental exposure is least for quetiapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics. The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations. It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed.

===Abuse potential===
In contrast to most other antipsychotic drugs, which tend to be somewhat aversive and often show problems with patient compliance with prescribed medication regimes, quetiapine is sometimes associated with drug misuse and abuse potential, for its hypnotic and sedative effects. It has a limited potential for misuse, usually only in individuals with a history of polysubstance abuse and/or mental illness, and especially in those incarcerated in prisons or secure psychiatric facilities where access to alternative intoxicants is more limited. To a significantly greater extent than other atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine was found to be associated with drug-seeking behaviors, and to have standardised street prices and slang terms associated with it, either by itself or in combination with other drugs (such as &quot;Q-ball&quot; for the intravenous injection of quetiapine mixed with cocaine). The pharmacological basis for this distinction from other second generation antipsychotic drugs is unclear, though it has been suggested that quetiapine&#x27;s comparatively lower dopamine receptor affinity and strong antihistamine activity might mean it could be regarded as more similar to sedating antihistamines in this context. While these issues have not been regarded as sufficient cause for placing quetiapine under increased legal controls, prescribers have been urged to show caution when prescribing quetiapine to individuals with characteristics that might place them at increased risk for drug misuse.

==Overdose==
Most instances of acute overdosage result in only sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrhythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10 mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25 mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases. Non-toxic levels in postmortem blood extend to around 0.8 mg/kg, but toxic levels in postmortem blood can begin at 0.35 mg/kg.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===

Quetiapine has the following pharmacological actions:

* Dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptor antagonist
* Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F receptor ligand
* α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist
* Histamine H1 receptor antagonist
* Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist

This means quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist to all other serotonin receptors it has affinity for. Serial PET scans evaluating the D2 receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D2 receptor. Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in prolactin. Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually autoreceptors whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters.

At very low doses, quetiapine acts primarily as a histamine receptor blocker (antihistamine) and α1-adrenergic blocker. When the dose is increased, quetiapine activates the adrenergic system and binds strongly to serotonin receptors and autoreceptors. At high doses, quetiapine starts blocking significant amounts of dopamine receptors. Due to the drug&#x27;s sedating H1 activity, it is often prescribed at low doses for insomnia. While some feel that low doses of drugs with antihistamine effects like quetiapine and mirtazapine are safer than drugs associated with physical dependency or other risk factors, concern has been raised by some professionals that off-label prescribing has become too widespread due to underappreciated hazards.

When treating schizophrenia, antagonism of D2 receptor by quetiapine in the mesolimbic pathway relieves positive symptoms and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor in the frontal cortex of the brain may relieve negative symptoms and reduce severity of psychotic episodes. Quetiapine has fewer extrapyramidal side effects and is less likely to cause hyperprolactinemia when compared to other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, so is used as a first line treatment.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Peak levels of quetiapine occur 1.5 hours after a dose. The plasma protein binding of quetiapine is 83%. The major active metabolite of quetiapine is norquetiapine (&quot;N&quot;-desalkylquetiapine). Quetiapine has an elimination half-life of 6 or 7 hours. Its metabolite, norquetiapine, has a half-life of 9 to 12 hours. Quetiapine is excreted primarily via the kidneys (73%) and in feces (20%) after hepatic metabolism, the remainder (1%) is excreted as the drug in its unmetabolized form.

==Chemistry==
Quetiapine is a tetracyclic compound and is closely related structurally to clozapine, olanzapine, loxapine, and other tetracyclic antipsychotics.

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The lactam is first treated with phosphoryl chloride to produce a dibenzothiazepine. A nucleophilic substitution is used to introduce the sidechain.

==History==

===Sustained-release===
AstraZeneca submitted a new drug application for a sustained-release version of quetiapine in the United States, Canada, and the European Union in the second half of 2006 for treatment of schizophrenia.

In May 2007, the US FDA approved Seroquel XR for acute treatment of schizophrenia. During its 2007 Q2 earnings conference, AstraZeneca announced plans to launch Seroquel XR in the U.S. during August 2007. However, Seroquel XR has become available in U.S. pharmacies only after the FDA approved Seroquel XR for use as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, in addition to acute treatment of the illness, on 16 November 2007. The company has not provided a reason for the delay of Seroquel XR&#x27;s launch.

Health Canada approved sale of Seroquel XR on 27 September 2007.

In October 2008, the FDA approved Seroquel XR for the treatment of bipolar depression and bipolar mania.

In December 2008, Biovail announced that the FDA had accepted the company&#x27;s ANDA to market its own version of sustained-release quetiapine. Biovail&#x27;s sustained-release tablets will compete with AstraZeneca&#x27;s Seroquel XR.

In December 2008, AstraZeneca notified shareholders that the FDA had asked for additional information on the company&#x27;s application to expand the use of sustained-release quetiapine for treatment of depression.

==Society and culture==

===Regulatory status===
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar mania) and for treatment of bipolar depression. In 2009, quetiapine XR was approved as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.

Quetiapine received its initial approval from the US FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in 1997. In 2004, it received its second indication for the treatment of mania-associated bipolar disorder. In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on quetiapine&#x27;s efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and major depression.

Patent protection for the product ended in 2012; however, in a number of regions, the long-acting version remained under patent until 2017.

===Lawsuits===
In April 2010, the U. S. Department of Justice fined AstraZeneca $520 million for the company&#x27;s aggressive marketing of Seroquel for off-label uses. According to the Department of Justice, &quot;the company recruited doctors to serve as authors of articles that were ghostwritten by medical literature companies and about studies the doctors in question did not conduct. AstraZeneca then used those studies and articles as the basis for promotional messages about unapproved uses of Seroquel.&quot;

Multiple lawsuits have been filed in relation to quetiapine&#x27;s side-effects, in particular, diabetes.

Approximately 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against AstraZeneca, alleging that quetiapine caused problems ranging from slurred speech and chronic insomnia to deaths.

===Controversy===
In 2004, a young man named Dan Markingson committed suicide in a controversial Seroquel clinical trial at the University of Minnesota while under an involuntary commitment order. A group of University of Minnesota bioethicists charged that the trial involved an alarming number of ethical violations.

===Nurofen Plus tampering case===
In August 2011, the UK&#x27;s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a class-4 drug alert following reports that some batches of Nurofen plus contained Seroquel XL tablets instead.

Following the issue of the Class-4 Drug Alert, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd received further reports of rogue blister strips in cartons of two additional batches of Nurofen Plus tablets. One of the new batches contained Seroquel XL 50 mg tablets and one contained the Pfizer product Neurontin 100 mg capsules.

Following discussions with the MHRA&#x27;s Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC), Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd decided to recall all remaining unexpired stock of Nurofen Plus tablets in any pack size, leading to a Class-1 Drug Alert. The contamination was later traced to in-store tampering by a customer.

<doc id="185385" wikidata="Q205517" url="?curid=185385" title="Ziprasidone">
<text>Ziprasidone, sold under the brand name Geodon among others, is an atypical antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It may be used by mouth and by injection into a muscle (IM). The IM form may be used for acute agitation in people with schizophrenia.
Common side effects include tremors, tics, dizziness, dry mouth, restlessness, nausea, and mild sedation. Although it can also cause weight gain, the risk is much lower than for other atypical antipsychotics. How it works is not entirely clear but is believed to involve effects on serotonin and dopamine in the brain.
Ziprasidone was approved for medical use in the United States in 2001. The pills are made up of the hydrochloride salt, ziprasidone hydrochloride. The intramuscular form is the mesylate, ziprasidone mesylate trihydrate, and is provided as a lyophilized powder. In 2020, it was the 282nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.
==Medical uses==
Ziprasidone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of schizophrenia as well as acute mania and mixed states associated with bipolar disorder. Its intramuscular injection form is approved for acute agitation in schizophrenic patients for whom treatment with just ziprasidone is appropriate.

In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, ziprasidone demonstrated mild-standard effectiveness. Ziprasidone was 15% more effective than lurasidone and iloperidone, approximately as effective as chlorpromazine and asenapine, and 9–13% less effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Ziprasidone is effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, though evidence from the CATIE trials suggests it is less effective than olanzapine, and equally as effective compared to quetiapine. There are higher discontinuation rates for lower doses of ziprasidone, which are also less effective than higher doses.

==Adverse effects==
Ziprasidone (and all other second generation antipsychotics (SGAs)) received a black box warning due to increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis.

Sleepiness and headache are very common adverse effects (&gt;10%).

Common adverse effects (1–10%), include producing too much saliva or having dry mouth, runny nose, respiratory disorders or coughing, nausea and vomiting, stomach aches, constipation or diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight gain (but the smallest risk for weight gain compared to other antipsychotics), rashes, fast heart beats, blood pressure falling when standing up quickly, muscle pain, weakness, twitches, dizziness, and anxiety. Extrapyramidal symptoms are also common and include tremor, dystonia (sustained or repetitive muscle contractions), akathisia (the feeling of a need to be in motion), parkinsonism, and muscle rigidity; in a 2013 meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, ziprasidone ranked 8th for such side effects.

Ziprasidone is known to trigger mania in some bipolar patients.

This medication can cause birth defects, according to animal studies, although this side effect has not been confirmed in humans.

Recently, the FDA required the manufacturers of some atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of hyperglycemia and Type II diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. Some evidence suggests that ziprasidone does not cause insulin resistance to the degree of other atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine. Weight gain is also less of a concern with ziprasidone compared to other atypical antipsychotics. In fact, in a trial of long term therapy with ziprasidone, overweight patients (BMI &gt; 27) actually had a mean weight loss overall. According to the manufacturer insert, ziprasidone caused an average weight gain of 2.2 kg (4.8 lbs), which is significantly lower than other atypical antipsychotics, making this medication better for patients that are concerned about their weight.
In December 2014, the FDA warned that ziprasidone could cause a potentially fatal skin reaction, Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), although this was believed to occur only rarely.

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.

There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

====Correspondence to clinical effects====

Ziprasidone mostly affects the receptors of dopamine (D2), serotonin (5-HT2A, partially 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1D) and epinephrine/norepinephrine (α1) to a high degree, while of histamine (H1) - moderately. It also somewhat inhibits reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, though not dopamine.

Ziprasidone&#x27;s efficacy in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia is believed to be mediated primarily via antagonism of the dopamine receptors, specifically D2. Blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor may also play a role in its effectiveness against positive symptoms, though the significance of this property in antipsychotic drugs is still debated among researchers. Blockade of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C and activation of 5-HT1A as well as inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine may all contribute to its ability to alleviate negative symptoms.; however, its effects on the 5-HT1A receptor may be limited as a study found ziprasidone would likely &quot;produce detectable occupancy [of 5-HT1A receptors] only at higher doses that would produce unacceptable levels of side effects in man, although lower doses are sufficient to produce pharmacological effects.&quot; The relatively weak antagonistic actions of ziprasidone on the α1-adrenergic receptor likely in part explains some of its side effects, such as orthostatic hypotension. Unlike many other antipsychotics, ziprasidone has no significant affinity for the mACh receptors, and as such lacks any anticholinergic side effects. Like most other antipsychotics, ziprasidone is sedating due primarily to serotonin and dopamine blockade.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The systemic bioavailability of ziprasidone is 100% when administered intramuscularly and 60% when administered orally without food.

After a single dose intramuscular administration, the peak serum concentration typically occurs at about 60 minutes after the dose is administered, or earlier. Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within one to three days. Exposure increases in a dose-related manner and following three days of intramuscular dosing, little accumulation is observed.

The bioavailability of the drug is reduced by approximately 50% if a meal is not eaten before Ziprasidone ingestion.

Ziprasidone is hepatically metabolized by aldehyde oxidase; minor metabolism occurs via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Medications that induce (e.g. carbamazepine) or inhibit (e.g. ketoconazole) CYP3A4 have been shown to decrease and increase, respectively, blood levels of ziprasidone.

Its biological half-life time is 10 hours at doses of 80–120 milligrams.

==History==

Ziprasidone is chemically similar to risperidone, of which it is a structural analogue. 
It was first synthesized in 1987 at the Pfizer central research campus in Groton, Connecticut.

Phase I trials started in 1995. In 1998 ziprasidone was approved in Sweden. After the FDA raised concerns about long QT syndrome, more clinical trials were conducted and submitted to the FDA, which approved the drug on February 5, 2001.

==Society and culture==

===Lawsuit===
In September 2009, the U.S. Justice Department announced that Pfizer had been ordered to pay a historic fine of $2.3 billion as a penalty for fraudulent marketing of several drugs, including Geodon. Pfizer had illegally promoted Geodon and submitted false claims to government health care programs for uses that were not medically accepted indications. The civil settlement also resolves allegations that Pfizer paid kickbacks to health care providers to induce them to prescribe Geodon, as well as other drugs. This was the largest civil fraud settlement in history against a pharmaceutical company.

=== Brand names ===
In the US, Geodon is marketed by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

<doc id="185387" wikidata="Q1542326" url="?curid=185387" title="45th Annual Grammy Awards">
<text>The 45th Annual Grammy Awards were held on February 23, 2003, at Madison Square Garden in New York City honoring the best in music for the recording of the year beginning from October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2002. Musicians&#x27; accomplishments from the previous year were recognized. Norah Jones and her song &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why&quot; were the main recipients of the night, garnering six Grammys, including four major awards: Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist, plus Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. Songwriter Jesse Harris received the Song of the Year award for his work on &quot;Don&#x27;t Know Why.&quot; Simon and Garfunkel reunited to open the show performing &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;.

The Bee Gees were presented with the &quot;Legend Award&quot;, only 42 days after the sudden death of Maurice Gibb. The award was received by the surviving brothers, Barry and Robin. During Barry&#x27;s speech, he made mention of Maurice&#x27;s widow Yvonne and their children Adam and Sami, and in a heartfelt, gracious and tearful moment announced that he and Robin were presenting the award to Maurice. It was then accepted by Adam, at Barry&#x27;s request, on behalf of his late father, his mother and his sister.

<text>Olanzapine, sold under the brand name Zyprexa among others, is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is also sometimes used off-label for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and as an appetite stimulant. For schizophrenia, it can be used for both new-onset disease and long-term maintenance. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a muscle.
Common side effects include significant weight gain, feeling tired, dizziness, constipation, dry mouth, and restlessness. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, allergic reactions, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, diabetes mellitus, seizures, and tardive dyskinesia. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the later part of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Although how it works is not entirely clear, it blocks dopamine and serotonin receptors.
Olanzapine was patented in 1991 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 171st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.
==Medical uses==
It is approved by the FDA for the following indications:

* schizophrenia.
* acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder.
* adjunct to lithium or valproate in the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
* combination olanzapine/fluoxetine (Symbyax) for the treatment of depressive episodes of bipolar I disorder and for treatment-resistant depression.
* combination olanzapine/samidorphan (Lybalvi) for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. Lybalvi suppresses the metabolic side effect of olanzapine. More precisely, olanzapine produces weight gain of about 9kg (20 pounds) in the short-term, which typically increases to around 23–45kg (50–100 pounds) following long-term use. In contrast, Lybalvi only triggers roughly 5kg (11 pounds) before subsiding.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, it is approved for schizophrenia, moderate to severe manic episodes, alone, or in combination with lithium or valproate and the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.

Olanzapine is also used off-label for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

===Schizophrenia===
The first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Olanzapine appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, treating acute exacerbations, and treating early-onset schizophrenia. The usefulness of maintenance therapy, however, is difficult to determine, as more than half of people in trials quit before the 6-week completion date. Treatment with olanzapine (like clozapine) may result in increased weight gain and increased glucose and cholesterol levels when compared to most other second-generation antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia.

===Bipolar disorder===
Olanzapine is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as a first-line therapy for the treatment of acute mania in bipolar disorder. Other recommended first-line treatments are aripiprazole, haloperidol, quetiapine, and risperidone. It is recommended in combination with fluoxetine as a first-line therapy for acute bipolar depression, and as a second-line treatment by itself for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.

The Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommends olanzapine as a first-line maintenance treatment for bipolar disorder and the combination of olanzapine with fluoxetine as a second-line treatment for bipolar depression.

A review on the efficacy of olanzapine as maintenance therapy in people with bipolar disorder was published in 2006. A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that olanzapine with fluoxetine was the most effective among nine treatments for bipolar depression included in the analysis.

===Specific populations===

====Pregnancy and lactation====
Olanzapine is associated with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Despite this, the available evidence suggests it is safe during pregnancy, although the evidence is insufficiently strong to say anything with a high degree of confidence. Olanzapine is associated with weight gain, which according to recent studies, may put olanzapine-treated patients&#x27; offspring at a heightened risk for neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida). Breastfeeding in women taking olanzapine is advised against because olanzapine is secreted in breast milk, with one study finding that the exposure to the infant is about 1.8% that of the mother.

====Elderly====
Citing an increased risk of stroke, in 2004, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in the UK issued a warning that olanzapine and risperidone, both atypical antipsychotic medications, should not be given to elderly patients with dementia. In the U.S., olanzapine comes with a black box warning for increased risk of death in elderly patients. It is not approved for use in patients with dementia-related psychosis. A BBC investigation in June 2008 found that this advice was being widely ignored by British doctors. Evidence suggested that the elderly are more likely to experience weight gain on olanzapine compared to aripiprazole and risperidone.

== Adverse effects ==
The principal side effect of olanzapine is weight gain, which may be profound in some cases and/or associated with derangement in blood-lipid and blood-sugar profiles (see section metabolic effects). A 2013 meta-analysis of the efficacy and tolerance of 15 antipsychotic drugs (APDs) found that it had the highest propensity for causing weight gain out of the 15 APDs compared with an SMD of 0.74. Extrapyramidal side effects, although potentially serious, are infrequent to rare from olanzapine, but may include tremors and muscle rigidity.

Aripiprazole, asenapine, clozapine, quetiapine and olanzapine, in comparison to other antipsychotic drugs, are less frequently associated with hyperprolactinaemia. Although these drugs can cause transient or sustained hyperprolactinaemia, the risk is much lower. Owing to its partial dopaminergic agonist effect, aripiprazole is likely to reduce prolactin levels and, in some patients, can cause hypoprolactinaemia. Although olanzapine causes an early dose-related rise in prolactin, this is less frequent and less marked than that seen with haloperidol, and is usually transient. A rise in prolactin is seen in about half of patients on olanzapine compared to over 90% of those taking risperidone, and enduring increases were less frequent in those taking olanzapine.

It is not recommended to be used by IM injection in acute myocardial infarction, bradycardia, recent heart surgery, severe hypotension, sick sinus syndrome, and unstable angina.

Several patient groups are at a heightened risk of side effects from olanzapine and antipsychotics in general. Olanzapine may produce nontrivial high blood sugar in people with diabetes mellitus. Likewise, the elderly are at a greater risk of falls and accidental injury. Young males appear to be at heightened risk of dystonic reactions, although these are relatively rare with olanzapine. Most antipsychotics, including olanzapine, may disrupt the body&#x27;s natural thermoregulatory systems, thus permitting excursions to dangerous levels when situations (exposure to heat, strenuous exercise) occur.

Other side effects possibly include galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia, and erectile dysfunction (impotence).

=== Drug-induced OCD ===
Many different types of medication can create or induce pure obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in people who have never had symptoms before.

===Metabolic effects===
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires atypical antipsychotics to include a warning about the risk of developing hyperglycemia and diabetes, both of which are factors in the metabolic syndrome. These effects may be related to the drugs&#x27; ability to induce weight gain, although some reports have been made of metabolic changes in the absence of weight gain. Studies have indicated that olanzapine carries a greater risk of causing and exacerbating diabetes than another commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotic, risperidone. Of all the atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine is one of the most likely to induce weight gain based on various measures. The effect is dose dependent in humans and animal models of olanzapine-induced metabolic side effects. There are some case reports of olanzapine-induced diabetic ketoacidosis. Olanzapine may decrease insulin sensitivity, though one 3-week study seems to refute this. It may also increase triglyceride levels.

Despite weight gain, a large multicenter, randomized National Institute of Mental Health study found that olanzapine was better at controlling symptoms because patients were more likely to remain on olanzapine than the other drugs. One small, open-label, nonrandomized study suggests that taking olanzapine by orally dissolving tablets may induce less weight gain, but this has not been substantiated in a blinded experimental setting.

===Post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome===
Postinjection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS) is a rare syndrome that is specific to the long-acting injectable formulation of olanzapine, olanzapine pamoate. The incidence of PDSS with olanzapine pamoate is estimated to be 0.07% of administrations, and is unique among other second-generation, long-acting antipsychotics (e.g. paliperidone palmitate), which do not appear to carry the same risk. PDSS is characterized by symptoms of delirium (e.g. confusion, difficulty speaking, and uncoordinated movements) and sedation. Most people with PDSS exhibit both delirium and sedation (83%). Although less specific to PDSS, a majority of cases (67%) involved a feeling of general discomfort. PDSS may occur due to accidental injection and absorption of olanzapine pamoate into the bloodstream, where it can act more rapidly, as opposed to slowly distributing out from muscle tissue. Using the proper, intramuscular-injection technique for olanzapine pamoate helps to decrease the risk of PDSS, though it does not eliminate it entirely. This is why the FDA advises that people who are injected with olanzapine pamoate be watched for 3 hours after administration, in the event that PDSS occurs.

===Animal toxicology===
Olanzapine has demonstrated carcinogenic effects in multiple studies when exposed chronically to female mice and rats, but not male mice and rats. The tumors found were in either the liver or mammary glands of the animals.

===Discontinuation===
The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly, vertigo, numbness, or muscle pains may occur. Symptoms generally resolve after a short time.

Tentative evidence indicates that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis, as a temporary withdrawal symptom. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely, tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

==Overdose==
Symptoms of an overdose include tachycardia, agitation, dysarthria, decreased consciousness, and coma. Death has been reported after an acute overdose of 450 mg, but also survival after an acute overdose of 2000 mg. Fatalities generally have occurred with olanzapine plasma concentrations greater than 1000 ng/mL &quot;post mortem&quot;, with concentrations up to 5200 ng/mL recorded (though this might represent confounding by dead tissue, which may release olanzapine into the blood upon death). No specific antidote for olanzapine overdose is known, and even physicians are recommended to call a certified poison control center for information on the treatment of such a case.
Olanzapine is considered moderately toxic in overdose, more toxic than quetiapine, aripiprazole, and the SSRIs, and less toxic than the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants.

==Interactions==
Drugs or agents that increase the activity of the enzyme CYP1A2, notably tobacco smoke, may significantly increase hepatic first-pass clearance of olanzapine; conversely, drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 activity (examples: ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine) may reduce olanzapine clearance. Carbamazepine, a known enzyme inducer, has decreased the concentration/dose ratio of olanzapine by 33% compared to olanzapine alone. Another enzyme inducer, ritonavir, has also been shown to decrease the body&#x27;s exposure to olanzapine, due to its induction of the enzymes CYP1A2 and uridine 5&#x27;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT).
Probenecid increases the total exposure (area under the curve) and maximum plasma concentration of olanzapine. Although olanzapine&#x27;s metabolism includes the minor metabolic pathway of CYP2D6, the presence of the CYP2D6 inhibitor fluoxetine does not have a clinically significant effect on olanzapine&#x27;s clearance.

Olanzapine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===


Olanzapine was first discovered while searching for a chemical analog of clozapine that would not require hematological monitoring. Investigation on a series of thiophene isosteres on 1 of the phenyl rings in clozapine, a thienobenzodiazepine analog (olanzapine) was discovered.

Olanzapine has a higher affinity for 5-HT2A serotonin receptors than D2 dopamine receptors, which is a common property of most atypical antipsychotics, aside from the benzamide antipsychotics such as amisulpride along with the nonbenzamides aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, blonanserin, cariprazine, melperone, and perospirone.

In one study D2 receptor occupancy was 60% with low-dose olanzapine (5 mg/day) and occupancy with high dose at 83% (20 mg/day). In the usual clinical dose range of 10–20 mg/day, D2 receptor occupancy varied from 71% to 80%.

Olanzapine occupancy at 5-HT2A receptor are high at all doses (5 mg to 20 mg). It is reported that 5 mg dose of olanzapine produced a mean occupancy of 85% at 5 mg, 88% at 10 mg, and 93% at 20 mg dose.

Olanzapine had the highest affinity of any second-generation antipsychotic towards the P-glycoprotein in one &quot;in vitro&quot; study. P-glycoprotein transports a myriad of drugs across a number of different biological membranes (found in numerous body systems) including the blood–brain barrier (a semipermeable membrane that filters the contents of blood prior to it reaching the brain); P-GP inhibition could mean that less brain exposure to olanzapine results from this interaction with the P-glycoprotein. A relatively large quantity of commonly encountered foods and medications inhibit P-GP, and pharmaceuticals fairly commonly are either substrates of P-GP or inhibit its action; both substrates and inhibitors of P-GP effectively increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier to P-GP substrates and subsequently increase the central activity of the substrate, while reducing the local effects on the GI tract. The mediation of olanzapine in the central nervous system by P-GP means that any other substance or drug that interacts with P-GP increases the risk for toxic accumulations of both olanzapine and the other drug.

Olanzapine is a potent antagonist of the muscarinic M3 receptor, which may underlie its diabetogenic side effects.
Additionally, it also exhibits a relatively low affinity for serotonin 5-HT1, GABAA, β-adrenergic receptors, and benzodiazepine binding sites.

Although antagonistic effects of olanzapine at 5-HT2C alone are not associated with weight gain, olanzapine antagonism at histaminergic H1, and muscarinic M3 receptors have been implicated in weight gain.

The mode of action of olanzapine&#x27;s antipsychotic activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Antagonism of dopamine receptors is associated with extrapyramidal effects such as tardive dyskinesia (TD), and with therapeutic effects. Antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is associated with anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation; in addition, it may suppress or reduce the emergence of extrapyramidal effects for the duration of treatment, but it offers no protection against the development of TD. In common with other second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics, olanzapine poses a relatively low risk of extrapyramidal side effects including TD, due to its higher affinity for the 5HT2A receptor over the D2 receptor.

Antagonizing H1 histamine receptors causes sedation and may cause weight gain, although antagonistic actions at serotonin 5-HT2C and dopamine D2 receptors have also been associated with weight gain and appetite stimulation.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Metabolism====
Olanzapine is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system; principally by isozyme 1A2 (CYP1A2) and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6. By these mechanisms, more than 40% of the oral dose, on average, is removed by the hepatic first-pass effect. Clearance of olanzapine appears to vary by sex; women have roughly 25% lower clearance than men. Clearance of olanzapine also varies by race; in self-identified African Americans or Blacks, olanzapine&#x27;s clearance was 26% higher. A difference in the clearance is not apparent between individuals identifying as Caucasian, Chinese, or Japanese. Routine, pharmacokinetic monitoring of olanzapine plasma levels is generally unwarranted, though unusual circumstances (e.g. the presence of drug-drug interactions) or a desire to determine if patients are taking their medicine may prompt its use.

====Chemistry====
Olanzapine is unusual in having four well-characterised crystalline polymorphs and many hydrated forms.

==Chemical synthesis==
The preparation of olanzapine was first disclosed in a series of patents from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. in the 1990s. In the final two steps, 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-thiophenecarbonitrile was reduced with stannous chloride in ethanol to give the substituted thienobenzodiazepine ring system, and this was treated with methylpiperazine in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and toluene as solvent to produce the drug.

==Society and culture==
===Legal status===
Olanzapine is approved by the US FDA for:

* Treatment—in combination with fluoxetine—of depressive episodes associated with bipolar disorder (December 2003).

* Long-term treatment of bipolar I disorder (January 2004).
* Long-term treatment—in combination with fluoxetine—of resistant depression (March 2009)
* Oral formulation: acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in adults, acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (monotherapy and in combination with lithium or sodium valproate)
* Intramuscular formulation: acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar I mania in adults
* Oral formulation combined with fluoxetine: treatment of acute depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults, or treatment of acute, resistant depression in adults
* Treatment of the manifestations of psychotic disorders (September 1996 – March 2000).

* Short-term treatment of schizophrenia instead of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders (March 2000)
* Maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for about eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months (November 2000)

The drug became generic in 2011. Sales of Zyprexa in 2008 were $2.2 billion in the US and $4.7 billion worldwide.

===Controversy and litigation===
Eli Lilly has faced many lawsuits from people who claimed they developed diabetes or other diseases after taking Zyprexa, as well as by various governmental entities, insurance companies, and others. Lilly produced a large number of documents as part of the discovery phase of this litigation, which started in 2004; the documents were ruled to be confidential by a judge and placed under seal, and later themselves became the subject of litigation.

In 2006, Lilly paid $700 million to settle around 8,000 of these lawsuits, and in early 2007, Lilly settled around 18,000 suits for $500 million, which brought the total Lilly had paid to settle suits related to the drug to $1.2 billion.

A December 2006 &quot;New York Times&quot; article based on leaked company documents concluded that the company had engaged in a deliberate effort to downplay olanzapine&#x27;s side effects. The company denied these allegations and stated that the article had been based on cherry-picked documents. The documents were provided to the &quot;Times&quot; by Jim Gottstein, a lawyer who represented mentally ill patients, who obtained them from a doctor, David Egilman, who was serving as an expert consultant on the case. After the documents were leaked to online peer-to-peer, file-sharing networks by Will Hall and others in the psychiatric survivors movement, who obtained copies, in 2007 Lilly filed a protection order to stop the dissemination of some of the documents, which Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Brooklyn Federal District Court granted. Judge Weinstein also criticized the &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, Gottstein, and Egilman in the ruling. &quot;The Times&quot; of London also received the documents and reported that as early as 1998, Lilly considered the risk of drug-induced obesity to be a &quot;top threat&quot; to Zyprexa sales. On 9 October 2000, senior Lilly research physician Robert Baker noted that an academic advisory board to which he belonged was &quot;quite impressed by the magnitude of weight gain on olanzapine and implications for glucose.&quot;

Lilly had threatened Egilman with criminal contempt charges regarding the documents he took and provided to reporters; in September 2007, he agreed to pay Lilly $100,000 in return for the company&#x27;s agreement to drop the threat of charges.

In September 2008, Judge Weinstein issued an order to make public Lilly&#x27;s internal documents about the drug in a different suit brought by insurance companies, pension funds, and other payors.

In March 2008, Lilly settled a suit with the state of Alaska, and in October 2008, Lilly agreed to pay $62 million to 32 states and the District of Columbia to settle suits brought under state consumer protection laws.

In 2009, Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to a US federal criminal misdemeanor charge of illegally marketing Zyprexa for off-label use and agreed to pay $1.4 billion. The settlement announcement stated &quot;Eli Lilly admits that between September 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as a treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets.&quot;

The outcomes described here, and their legal ramifications, were fueled by motions and appeals that were not resolved until 2010. In 2021, Gottstein summarized this tangle of legal activities, and their impact on the political landscape of psychiatry and antipsychiatry in the US, in &quot;The Zyprexa Papers&quot;.

===Brand names===
Olanzapine is generic and available under many brand names worldwide.
===Dosage forms===
Olanzapine is marketed in many countries, with tablets ranging from 2.5 to 20 mg. Zyprexa (and generic olanzapine) is available as an orally disintegrating &quot;wafer&quot;, which rapidly dissolves in saliva. It is also available in 10-mg vials for intramuscular injection.

==Research==
Olanzapine may be useful in promoting weight gain in underweight adult outpatients with anorexia nervosa. However, no improvement in psychological symptoms was noted. It has also been shown to be helpful in the management of cancer-related anorexia.

Olanzapine has been shown to help address a range of anxiety and depressive symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders, and has since been used in the treatment of a range of mood and anxiety disorders. Olanzapine is no less effective than lithium or valproate and more effective than placebo in treating bipolar disorder. It has also been used for Tourette syndrome and stuttering.

Olanzapine has been studied for the treatment of hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, and repetitive behaviors in autism.

Olanzapine is frequently prescribed off-label for the treatment of insomnia, including difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, even though such use is not recommended. The daytime sedation experienced with olanzapine is generally comparable to quetiapine and lurasidone, which is a frequent complaint in clinical trials. In some cases, the sedation due to olanzapine impaired the ability of people to wake up at a consistent time every day. Some evidence of efficacy for treating insomnia is seen; however, side effects such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia, which may be observed even at low doses, outweigh any potential benefits for insomnia that are not due to an underlying mental health condition.

Olanzapine has been recommended to be used in antiemetic regimens in people receiving chemotherapy that has a high risk for vomiting.

Olanzapine has been studied as an antiemetic, particularly for the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV).

In general, olanzapine appears to be about as effective as aprepitant for the prevention of CINV, though some concerns remain about its use in this population. For example, concomitant use of metoclopramide or haloperidol increases the risk for extrapyramidal symptoms. Otherwise, olanzapine appears to be fairly well tolerated for this indication, with somnolence being the most common side effect. Olanzapine is more effective than metoclopramide for breakthrough CINV. It is also more effective than placebo when added to a combination of palonosetron, dexamethasone and aprepitant.

Olanzapine has been considered as part of an early psychosis approach for schizophrenia. The Prevention through Risk Identification, Management, and Education study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and Eli Lilly, tested the hypothesis that olanzapine might prevent the onset of psychosis in people at very high risk for schizophrenia. The study examined 60 patients with prodromal schizophrenia, who were at an estimated risk of 36–54% of developing schizophrenia within a year and treated half with olanzapine and half with placebo. In this study, patients receiving olanzapine did not have a significantly lower risk of progressing to psychosis (16.1% vs 37.9%). Olanzapine was effective for treating the prodromal symptoms but was associated with significant weight gain.

In some countries, oblasts are also known by cognates of the Russian term.

The term &quot;oblast&quot; is borrowed from Russian область (), where it is inherited from Old East Slavic, in turn borrowed from Church Slavonic область &quot;oblastĭ&quot; &#x27;power, empire&#x27;, formed from the prefix (cognate with Classical Latin &quot;ob&quot; &#x27;towards, against&#x27; and Ancient Greek ἐπί/ἔπι &quot;epi&quot; &#x27;in power, in charge&#x27;) and the stem &quot;vlastǐ&quot; &#x27;power, rule&#x27;. In Old East Slavic, it was used alongside &quot;obolostǐ&quot;—the equivalent of &#x27;against&#x27; and &#x27;territory, state, power&#x27; (cognate with English &#x27;wield&#x27;; see volost).

==History==
===Russian Empire===
In the Russian Empire, oblasts were considered to be administrative units and were included as parts of Governorates General or krais. The majority of then-existing oblasts were on the periphery of the country (e.g. Kars Oblast or Transcaspian Oblast) or covered the areas where Cossacks lived.

===Soviet Union===
In the Soviet Union, oblasts were one of the types of administrative divisions of the union republics. As any administrative units of this level, oblasts were composed of districts (&quot;raions&quot;) and cities/towns directly under oblasts&#x27; jurisdiction. Some oblasts also included autonomous entities called autonomous okrugs. Because of the Soviet Union electrification program under the GOELRO plan, Ivan Alexandrov, as director of the Regionalisation Committee of Gosplan, divided the Soviet Union into thirteen European and eight Asiatic oblasts, using rational economic planning rather than &quot;the vestiges of lost sovereign rights&quot;.

The names of oblasts did not usually correspond to the names of the respective historical regions, as they were created as purely administrative units. With a few exceptions, Soviet oblasts were named after their administrative centers.

===Yugoslavia===
In 1922, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was divided into 33 administrative divisions also called oblasts. In 1929, oblasts were replaced with larger administrative units known as banovinas.

During the Yugoslav Wars, several Serb Autonomous Oblasts were formed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. These oblasts were later merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the Republika Srpska.

==Modern oblasts==
===Bulgaria===
Since 1999, Bulgaria has been divided into 28 oblasts, usually translated as &quot;provinces&quot;. Before, the country was divided into just nine units, also called oblasts.

===Post-Soviet states===

&quot;Viloyat&quot; and &quot;welaýat&quot; are derived from the Turkish language term &quot;vilayet&quot;, itself derived from the Arabic language term &quot;wilāya&quot; ().

<text>Jini (), also called Apache River, is a network architecture for the construction of distributed systems in the form of modular co-operating services. JavaSpaces is a part of the Jini.

Originally developed by Sun Microsystems, Jini was released under the Apache License 2.0. Responsibility for Jini was transferred to Apache in 2007 under the project name &quot;River&quot;, but the project was retired in early 2022 due to lack of activity.

==History==
Sun Microsystems introduced Jini in July 1998. In November 1998, Sun announced that there were some firms supporting Jini.

The Jini team at Sun stated that &quot;Jini&quot; is not an acronym. Ken Arnold has joked that it means &quot;Jini Is Not Initials&quot;, making it a recursive anti-acronym, but it has always been just &quot;Jini&quot;. The word &#x27;jini&#x27; means &quot;the devil&quot; in Swahili; this is borrowed from the Arabic word for a mythological spirit, originated from the Latin &quot;genius&quot;, which is also the origin of the English word &#x27;genie&#x27;.

Jini provides the infrastructure for the Service-object-oriented architecture (SOOA).

==Using a service==
Locating services is done through a lookup service. Services try to contact a lookup service (LUS), either by unicast interaction, when it knows the actual location of the lookup service, or by dynamic multicast discovery. The lookup service returns an object called the service registrar that can be used by services to register themselves so they can be found by clients. Clients can use the lookup service to retrieve a proxy object to the service; calls to the proxy translate the call to a service request, performs this request on the service, and returns the result to the client. This strategy is more convenient than Java remote method invocation, which requires the client to know the location of the remote service in advance.

==Limitations==
Jini uses a lookup service to broker communication between the client and service. This appears to be a centralized model (though the communication between client and service can be seen as decentralized) that does not scale well to very large systems. However, the lookup service can be horizontally scaled by running multiple instances that listen to the same multicast group.

<doc id="185399" wikidata="Q7976884" url="?curid=185399" title="Wayson Choy">
<text>Wayson Choy (崔維新 Pinyin: Cuī Wéixīn; Jyutping: Ceoi1 Wai4-san1) (April 20, 1939 – April 28, 2019) was a Canadian novelist. Publishing two novels and two memoirs in his lifetime, he is considered one of the most important pioneers of Asian Canadian literature in Canada, and as an important figure in LGBT literature as one of Canada&#x27;s first openly gay writers of colour to achieve widespread mainstream success.

==Personal life and education==
Choy, whose birth name was Choy Way Sun, was born in Vancouver on April 20, 1939 and was adopted by parents Toy and Lilly. A Chinese Canadian, he spent his childhood in the city&#x27;s Chinatown. 

He graduated from Gladstone Secondary School and went on to attend the University of British Columbia, where he studied creative writing. He was the first Chinese-Canadian student accepted into the program.

He learned later in life that he had been adopted, which formed part of the basis for his memoir &quot;Paper Shadows&quot;.

In 2001, Choy suffered an asthma attack, which led to him being placed in a medically induced coma for 11 days during which he also suffered cardiac arrest. He remained in hospital for four months to recuperate and recover with physiotherapy. In 2005, he had a second heart attack, and underwent quadruple bypass surgery.

In 2010, Wilfrid Laurier University presented Choy with an honorary Doctorate of Literature.

==Career==
Choy published a number of short stories while studying creative writing at the University of British Columbia, with one of his stories appearing in the annual &quot;Best American Short Stories&quot; anthology, but after graduating he devoted himself primarily to teaching, resuming writing only later in life. Choy moved to Toronto in 1962, where he taught English at Burnhamthorpe Collegiate (1966–1967), then at Humber College from 1967 to 2004. He continued to teach at the Humber School for Writers, and served as president of the Cahoots Theatre Company.

Choy published his first novel, &quot;The Jade Peony&quot; in 1995. It won the Trillium Book Award and the City of Vancouver Book Award. In 2010, it was selected as one of five books for the CBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Canada Reads&quot; competition, where it was defended by physician Samantha Nutt.

His first memoir, &quot;Paper Shadows: A Chinatown Childhood,&quot; was published in 1999. Written about his childhood within the Chinese Canadian community in Vancouver, the book explores both his discovery that he was adopted and his process of coming to terms with being gay. It won the Edna Staebler Award for Creative Non-Fiction, and was shortlisted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language non-fiction at the 1999 Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

His second novel, &quot;All That Matters&quot;, was published in 2004 and was nominated for the Scotiabank Giller Prize. &quot;All That Matters&quot; won Choy&#x27;s second Trillium Book Award in 2004.

In 2005, he was named a member of the Order of Canada.

In 2009 Choy published &quot;Not Yet: A Memoir of Living and Almost Dying&quot;, his second and final memoir about dealing with the life-threatening health challenges.

In 2015, he received the George Woodcock Award, the lifetime achievement award for writers from British Columbia presented by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada and the Vancouver Public Library.

Three recently published monographs have featured chapters on Choy&#x27;s publications up to &quot;Not Yet&quot;; these are: John Z. Ming Chen&#x27;s &quot;The Influence of Daoism on Asian-Canadian Writers&quot; (Mellen, 2008), John Z. Ming Chen and Wei Li&#x27;s &quot;A Study of Canadian Social Realist Literature: Neo-Marxist, Confucian, and Daoist Approaches&quot; (Inner Mongolia University Press, 2011), John Z. Ming Chen and Yuhua Ji&#x27;s &quot;Canadian-Daoist Poetics, Ethics, and Aesthetics&quot; (Springer, 2015).

== Awards and honours ==
Choy was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2005. In 2015, he received the George Woodcock Award, a lifetime achievement award for writers from British Columbia presented by the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada and the Vancouver Public Library. Three years later, the City of Vancouver recognized him with their Civic Merit Award.

In 1999, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; named &quot;Paper Shadows&quot; among the year&#x27;s noteworthy books.

In 2010, &quot;The Jade Peony&quot; was selected as one of five books for the CBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Canada Reads&quot; competition, where it was defended by physician Samantha Nutt, founder of War Child.

In 2012, Project Bookmark Canada presented two plaques in Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown with excepts from &quot;The Jade Peony&quot; written in both English and Mandarin.

<doc id="185404" wikidata="Q854590" url="?curid=185404" title="Yellow Magic Orchestra">
<text>Yellow Magic Orchestra (abbreviated to YMO) was a Japanese electronic music band formed in Tokyo in 1978 by Haruomi Hosono (bass, keyboards, vocals), Yukihiro Takahashi (drums, lead vocals, occasional keyboards) and Ryuichi Sakamoto (keyboards, vocals). The group is considered influential and innovative in the field of popular electronic music. They were pioneers in their use of synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers, and digital recording technology, and effectively anticipated the &quot;electropop boom&quot; of the 1980s. They are credited with playing a key role in the development of several electronic genres, including synthpop, J-pop, electro, and techno, while exploring subversive sociopolitical themes throughout their career.

The three members were veterans of the music industry before coming together as YMO, and were inspired by eclectic sources, including the electronic music of Isao Tomita and Kraftwerk, Japanese traditional music, arcade games, funk music, and the disco productions of Giorgio Moroder. They released the surprise global hit &quot;Computer Game&quot; in 1978, reaching the UK Top 20 and selling 400,000 copies in the U.S. For their early recordings and performances, the band was often accompanied by programmer Hideki Matsutake. The group released several albums before pausing their activity in 1984. They briefly reunited several times in subsequent decades before Takahashi and Sakamoto&#x27;s deaths in 2023.

==History==

===1976–1978: early years and formation===
Prior to the group&#x27;s formation, Sakamoto had been experimenting with electronic music equipment at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, which he entered in 1970, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP. The group leader Haruomi Hosono had been using an Ace Tone rhythm machine since early in his career in the early 1970s. Following the break-up of his band Happy End in 1972, Hosono became involved in the recording of several early electronic rock records, including Yōsui Inoue&#x27;s folk pop rock album &quot;Kōri no Sekai&quot; (1973) and Osamu Kitajima&#x27;s progressive psychedelic rock album &quot;Benzaiten&quot; (1974), both of which utilized synthesizers, electric guitars, electric bass, and in the latter, electronic drums, and rhythm machines. Also around the same time, the band&#x27;s future &quot;fourth member&quot; Hideki Matsutake was the assistant for the internationally successful electronic musician Isao Tomita. Much of the methods and techniques developed by both Tomita and Matsutake during the early 1970s would later be employed by Yellow Magic Orchestra.

Sakamoto first worked with Hosono as a member of his live band in 1976, while Yukihiro Takahashi recruited Sakamoto to produce his debut solo recording in 1977 following the split of the Sadistic Mika Band. Hosono invited both to work on his exotica-flavoured album &quot;Paraiso&quot;, which included electronic songs produced using various electronic equipment. The band was named &quot;Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band&quot; as a satire of the idyllic perception of pacific and Hawaiian music America had been obsessed with and in late 1977 they began recording &quot;Paraiso&quot;, which was released in 1978. The three worked together again for the 1978 album &quot;Pacific&quot;, which included an early version of the song &quot;Cosmic Surfin&quot;. 

Hosono and Sakamoto also worked together alongside Hideki Matsutake in early 1978 for Hosono&#x27;s experimental &quot;electro-exotica&quot; fusion album &quot;Cochin Moon&quot;, which fused electronic music with Indian music, including an early &quot;synth raga&quot; song &quot;Hum Ghar Sajan&quot;. The same year, Sakamoto released his own solo album, &quot;The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto&quot;, experimenting with a similar fusion between electronic music and traditional Japanese music in early 1978. Hosono also contributed to one of Sakamoto&#x27;s songs, &quot;Thousand Knives&quot;, in the album. &quot;Thousand Knives&quot; was also notable for its early use of the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer music sequencer, with Matsutake as its music programmer for the album.

While Sakamoto was working on &quot;Thousand Knives&quot;, Hosono began formulating the idea of an instrumental disco band which could have the potential to reach success in non-Japanese-language territories, and invited Tasuo Hayashi of Tin Pan Alley and Hiroshi Sato of Huckleback as participants, but they declined. Hosono, Sakamoto and Takahashi eventually collaborated again to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra and they began recording their self-titled album at a Shibaura studio in July 1978.

===1978–1983: National and international success===

The band&#x27;s 1978 self-titled album &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; was successful and the studio project grew into a fully fledged touring band and career for its three members. The album featured the use of computer technology (along with synthesizers) which, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;, allowed the group to create a new sound that was not possible until then. Following the release of the album &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot;, a live date at the Roppongi Pit Inn was seen by executives of A&amp;M Records of the USA who were in the process of setting up a partnership deal with Alfa Records. This led to the YMO being offered an international deal, at which point (early 1979) the three members decided the group would be given priority over their solo careers. The most popular international hit from the album was &quot;Firecracker&quot;, which would be released as a single the following year and again as &quot;Computer Game&quot;, which became a success in the United States and Europe.

Following an advertising deal with Fuji Cassette, the group sparked a boom in the popularity of electronic pop music, called &quot;technopop&quot; in Japan, where they had an effect similar to that of the Beatles and Merseybeat in 1960s Britain. For some time, YMO was the most popular band in Japan. Successful solo act Akiko Yano (later married to Sakamoto) joined the band for its live performances in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but did not participate in the studio recordings. On the other hand, the YMO trio contributed to her own albums and became part of her live band, during these same years. Legendary English guitarist , who had disbanded and to more recently explore Electropop himself, likewise played on YMO&#x27;s (1983), its non-vocals variant (1984) and subsequent solo projects, before featuring the latter on two of Nelson&#x27;s own UK based releases.

Making abundant use of new synthesizers, samplers, sequencers, drum machines, computers and digital recording technology as it became available, as well as utilizing cyberpunk-ish lyrics sung mostly in English, they extended their popularity and influence beyond Japan.

Their second album, &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot;, released in 1979, was YMO&#x27;s pinnacle recording in Japan, winning the 1980 Best Album Award in the Japan Record Awards. It featured English lyrics by Chris Mosdell, whose sci-fi themes often depicted a human condition alienated by dystopic futures, much like the emerging cyberpunk movement in fiction at that time. One of the album&#x27;s major singles, and one of the band&#x27;s biggest international hits, was &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;, which YMO had first produced in 1978 for a Seiko quartz wristwatch commercial, and then for &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; with lyrics penned by Chris Mosdell. The song was later revised by Michael Jackson, who added new lyrics and had intended to include it in his album &quot;Thriller&quot;. Despite the approval of songwriter Sakamoto and lyricist Chris Mosdell, it was eventually removed from the album due to legal issues with YMO&#x27;s management. Jackson&#x27;s version was never released until his first posthumous album, &quot;Michael&quot;, though his additional lyrics were included in later cover versions of the song by Greg Phillinganes, Eric Clapton, and Ryuichi Sakamoto himself in his 1986 solo release &quot;Media Bahn Live&quot;. &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; included several early computerized synth rock songs, including a mechanized cover version of &quot;Day Tripper&quot; by the Beatles.

&quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; went on to sell over 2 million records worldwide. By 1980, YMO had become the most popular group in Japan, where they were performing to sold-out crowds. Their first live album &quot;Public Pressure&quot; set a record in Japan, topping the charts and selling 250,000 copies within two weeks, while their next studio album &quot;X∞Multiplies&quot; had 200,000 pre-orders before release. The same year, their albums &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; and &quot;X∞Multiplies&quot; held the top two spots on the Oricon charts for seven consecutive weeks, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat.

The 1980 song &quot;Multiplies&quot; was an early experiment in electronic ska. &quot;X∞Multiplies&quot; was followed up with the 1981 album &quot;BGM&quot;. &quot;Rap Phenomena&quot; from the album was an early attempt at electronic rap.

They also had similar success abroad, performing to sold-out crowds during tours in the United States and Europe. The single &quot;Computer Game&quot; had sold 400,000 copies in the United States and reached No. 17 in the UK Charts. The group also performed &quot;Firecracker&quot; and &quot;Tighten Up&quot; live on the &quot;Soul Train&quot; television show. At around the same time, the 1980 song &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; by YMO member Sakamoto pioneered the beats and sounds of electro music. The band was particularly popular with the emerging hip hop community, which appreciated the group&#x27;s electronic sounds, and in the Bronx where &quot;Firecracker&quot; was a success and sampled in the famous &quot;Death Mix&quot; (1983) by Afrika Bambaataa. Meanwhile, in Japan, YMO remained the best-selling music act there up until 1982.

===1984–1993: breakup and brief reunion===
The band had paused their group activities by 1984. After the release of their musical motion picture &quot;Propaganda&quot;, the three members had returned to their solo careers. They were careful to avoid saying they had &quot;split up&quot;, preferring to use the Japanese phrase meaning , and the trio continued to play on each other&#x27;s recordings and made guest appearances at live shows. Takahashi, in particular, would play the band&#x27;s material in his concerts. Meanwhile, Sakamoto would gain international success for his work as a solo artist, actor, and film composer, winning Grammy, Oscar, and Golden Globe awards.

Yellow Magic Orchestra released a one-off reunion album, &quot;Technodon&quot;, and credited it to &#x27;NOT YMO&#x27; (YMO crossed out with a calligraphy X) or YMO in 1993. Instead of traditional vocals, about half of it features field audio recordings and samples of authors and scientists reading their work. During their brief reunion in the early 1990s, they continued to experiment with new styles of electronic music, playing an instrumental role in the techno and acid house movements of the era.

===2002–2023: post-breakup and reformation ===
The early 2000s saw Hosono and Takahashi reunited in a project called Sketch Show. On a number of occasions Ryuichi Sakamoto has joined in on Sketch Show performances and recording sessions. He later proposed they rename the group Human Audio Sponge when he participates. The groups Barcelona performance at Sonar festival and Wild Sketch Show DVDs chronicle these reunions, and include a tongue-in-cheek Japanese text-only history of the group that spans to 2036.

The band have reunited in 2007 for an advertising campaign for Kirin Lager which lampooned their longevity and charted No.1 on various Japanese digital download charts (including iTunes Store chart) with the song &quot;Rydeen 79/07&quot;, released on Sakamoto&#x27;s new label commmons. Recently performing live as Human Audio Sponge; Hosono, Sakamoto, and Takahashi did a live performance together as Yellow Magic Orchestra for the Live Earth, Kyoto, event on July 7, 2007, which raised money and awareness of a &quot;climate in crisis&quot;.

In August 2007, the band once again reformed, taking the name HASYMO or HAS/YMO, combining the names of Human Audio Sponge and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Their first single under this name, &quot;Rescue&quot;, was written for the film Appleseed EX Machina. They released a new two song single titled &quot;The City of Light/Tokyo Town Pages&quot; on August 6, 2008. HASYMO played two live concerts in Europe in the summer of 2008, one at the Royal Festival Hall, London on June 15, as part of the Meltdown festival of music curated by Massive Attack and another in Gijón, Spain, on the 19th. Although the primary YMO members (Yukihiro Takahashi, Haruomi Hosono, and Ryuichi Sakamoto) were effectively known as HASYMO and played both these concerts, these concerts were billed simply as &quot;YMO&quot; but featured only 4 YMO songs in each concert while the rest of the concert featured Sketch Show, HASYMO music and members&#x27; solo works.

In August 2009, the band played the World Happiness festival in Japan, featuring many Japanese artists. The band closed the night, and confirmed that &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; was their official name, dropping the HASYMO title. They opened with a cover of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; and performed old YMO songs along with their newer songs.

In August 2010, YMO once again closed their World Happiness festival. They added classic songs from their back catalog into their set list. They also covered &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;. In January 2011, KCRW announced for their World Festival concert series that Yellow Magic Orchestra will perform at the Hollywood Bowl on June 26, 2011. Not long after, a concert for June 27, 2011, at The Warfield was added. It was announced in February that YMO would perform at the Fuji Rock festival in July and the World Happiness festival 2011 on August 7.

In 2012, Sakamoto helped organize the No Nukes 2012 festival held in the Makuhari Messe hall in Chiba, Japan, on July 7 and 8, 2012. Among the many artists performing, Kraftwerk closed the July 7 concert, with YMO performing on both days, closing the July 8 concert. YMO also headlined their World Happiness festival on August 12, 2012. After these performances, the band once again went quiet; though no formal announcement was made of a hiatus or breakup, the band ultimately did not reconvene for further recordings or headlining concerts.

On June 23, 2018, Hosono played his debut UK solo concert at the Barbican Centre in London; Takahashi and Sakamoto joined him on stage to perform &quot;Absolute Ego Dance&quot;, marking the final time that the three would appear together in public. (The band featured in Hosono&#x27;s second and third &quot;Yellow Magic Show&quot; on Japanese TV, both recorded in 2019; their appearance in the third was in front of a live audience, but Sakamoto appeared via prerecorded video.)

===2023: Takahashi and Sakamoto&#x27;s deaths===

On January 11, 2023, Takahashi died at the age of 70, following a case of pneumonia. He had undergone surgery to remove a brain tumor in 2020 but continued to have health troubles that interfered with his musical activities in the intervening years. That same year, Sakamoto died on March 28 at the age of 71, following a lengthy battle with cancer; leaving Hosono as the last surviving member of the group.

==Musical style and development==
While their contemporaries in Düsseldorf, and later Detroit, were using synthesizer technology to create bleak dystopian music, YMO introduced a more &quot;joyous and liberating&quot; approach to electronic music. According to Sakamoto, they were &quot;tired&quot; of Japanese musicians imitating Western and American music at the time and so they wanted to &quot;make something very original from Japan.&quot; Kraftwerk was particularly an influence on Sakamoto, who heard the band in the mid-1970s and later introduced them to his fellow band members. They were impressed with Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;very formalized&quot; style but wanted to avoid imitating their &quot;very German&quot; approach. He described Kraftwerk&#x27;s music as &quot;theoretical, very focused, simple and minimal and strong&quot;. Their alternative template for electronic pop was less minimalistic, made more varying use of synthesizer lines, introduced &quot;fun-loving and breezy&quot; sounds, and placed a strong emphasis on melody in contrast to Kraftwerk&#x27;s statuesque &quot;robot pop&quot;.

The band also drew from a wider range of influences than had been employed by Kraftwerk. These influences on YMO included Japanese electronic music (such as Isao Tomita), traditional Japanese music, experimental Chinese music (of the Cultural Revolution era), Indian music (such as Ravi Shankar and Bollywood music), arcade game samples, American rap, exotica, Caribbean ska, Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s disco work, the Beatles, the Beach Boys and their leader Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, classical music, animal sounds, and noise. Sakamoto has expressed that his &quot;concept when making music is that there is no border between music and noise.&quot;

===Sampling===
Their approach to sampling music was a precursor to the contemporary approach of constructing music by cutting fragments of sounds and looping them using computer technology. Their 1978 hit &quot;Computer Game / Firecracker&quot;, for example, sampled Martin Denny&#x27;s 1959 exotica melody &quot;Firecracker&quot; and arcade game sounds from &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Circus&quot;. According to &quot;The Vinyl District&quot; magazine, they also released the first album to feature mostly samples and loops (1981&#x27;s &quot;Technodelic&quot;). The pace at which the band&#x27;s music evolved has been acknowledged by critics. According to &quot;SF Weekly&quot;, YMO&#x27;s musical timeline has gone from &quot;zany exotica-disco spoofs&quot; and &quot;bleeps and blips&quot; in the 1970s to &quot;sensuous &quot;musique concrète&quot; perfected&quot; in their 1983 albums &quot;Naughty Boys&quot; and &quot;Service&quot;.

&quot;Technodelic&quot; (1981) was produced using the LMD-649, a PCM digital sampler that Toshiba-EMI sound engineer Kenji Murata custom-built for YMO. Soon after &quot;Technodelic&quot;, the LMD-649 was used by YMO-associated acts such as Chiemi Manabe and Logic System.

===Instruments===
The band often utilized a wide variety of state-of-the-art electronic music equipment immediately as they were made available. The group leader Haruomi Hosono had already been using an Ace Tone rhythm machine since early in his career in the early 1970s. &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; and Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Thousand Knives&quot; were one of the earliest popular music albums to utilize the Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which was programmed by Hideki Matsutake during recording sessions. Roland called the MC-8 a &quot;computer music composer&quot; and it was the first stand-alone microprocessor-based music sequencer. It also introduced features such as a keypad to enter note information and 16 KB of RAM which allowed a maximum sequence length of 5200 notes, a huge step forward from the 8–16 step sequencers of the era. While it was commercially unsuccessful due to its high price, the band were among the few bands at the time to utilize the MC-8, which they described as, along with its music programmer Hideki Matsutake, an &quot;inevitable factor&quot; in both their music production and live performances. &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (1979) made use of synthesizers for the melodies and digital gated reverb for the snare drums.

They were also the very first band to utilize the Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer, one of the first and most influential programmable drum machines, as soon as it was released in 1980. While the machine was initially unsuccessful due to its lack of digital sampling that the rival Linn LM-1 offered, the TR-808 featured various unique artificial percussion sounds, including a deep bass kick drum, &quot;tinny handclap sounds&quot;, &quot;the ticky snare, the tishy hi-hats (open and closed)&quot;, and &quot;the spacey cowbell&quot;, which YMO utilized and demonstrated in their music, as early as its year of release in 1980, paving the way for the TR-808&#x27;s mainstream popularity several years later, after which it would be used for more hit records than any other drum machine and continue to be widely used through to the present day.

At the time, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted that the use of such computer-based technology in conjunction with synthesizers allowed YMO to create new sounds that were not possible until then. &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; was also the first computer-themed music album, coming before Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Computer World&quot; (1981) by several years. As a result of such innovations, YMO were credited at the time for having &quot;ushered in the age of the computer programmer as rock star.&quot;

Other electronic equipment used by the group included the LMD-649 sampler (see &quot;Sampling&quot; above), Roland MC-4 Microcomposer sequencer, Pollard Syndrum electronic drums, Roland VP-330 and Korg VC-10 vocoders, Yamaha CS-80 and DX7 synthesizers, Korg PS-3100 and PS-3300 synthesizers, Moog III-C and Polymoog synthesizers, and ARP Odyssey, Oberheim Eight Voice, and E-mu Emulator synthesizers. Electric instruments were also used, the Fender Rhodes piano and Fender Jazz Bass.

==Legacy==

The band has been described as &quot;the original cyberpunks&quot; and their early work has been described as &quot;proto-techno&quot; music. By the 1990s, YMO were also frequently cited as pioneers of ambient house music. YMO also popularized a style of live performance that eschewed human movement in favour of electronics such as rhythm boxes and samplers. They also influenced the New Romantic movement, including British bands Duran Duran and Japan, whose member Steve Jansen was influenced by drummer Takahashi, while lead member David Sylvian was influenced by Sakamoto, who would later collaborate with Sylvian.

Various cover versions of &quot;Kimi ni Mune Kyun&quot; (1983) have also been produced by other artists, including The Human League in 1993 (&quot;YMO Versus The Human League&quot;) and Asako Toki in 2006. In 2009, a cover of &quot;Kimi ni Mune Kyun&quot; was used as the ending theme song for the anime adaptation of &quot;Maria Holic&quot;, sung by Asami Sanada, Marina Inoue, and Yū Kobayashi, the voice actresses of the main characters. In 2015, in the anime &quot;Sound! Euphonium&quot;, episode 5, the song &quot;Rydeen&quot; is played by Kitauji highschool&#x27;s orchestra. The popular anime series &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; also paid homage to the band with the song &quot;Solid State Scouter&quot; as the theme song of the 1990 TV special &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Bardock – The Father of Goku&quot;.

In HMV Japan&#x27;s list of top 100 Japanese musicians of all time, YMO were voted second place, behind only Southern All Stars, a pop-rock band who remain largely unknown outside Japan. In 2006, Senor Coconut paid tribute to the band with his &quot;Yellow Fever!&quot; album.

===Electronic music===
YMO were pioneers of synthpop, a genre which emerged at the start of the 1980s. In 1993, Johnny Black of &quot;Hi-Fi News&quot;, in a review for the record &quot;Hi-Tech/No Crime&quot;, described YMO as &quot;the most adventurous and influential electro-techno-dance technicians the world has produced&quot; and further argued that &quot;without them (and Kraftwerk) today&#x27;s music would still sound like yesterday&#x27;s music.&quot; In 2001, Jason Ankeny of the &quot;Allmusic Guide to Electronica&quot; described YMO as &quot;a seminal influence on contemporary electronic music – hugely popular both at home and abroad&quot; and placed them &quot;second only to Kraftwerk as innovators of today&#x27;s electronic culture.&quot;

YMO are considered pioneers in the field of popular electronic music, and continue to be remixed or sampled by modern artists, including experimental artist Yamantaka Eye, electronica group LFO, jungle band 4hero, electrolatino artist Senor Coconut, ambient house pioneers The Orb and 808 State, electronic music groups Orbital and The Human League, hip hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, and mainstream pop musicians such as Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Greg Phillinganes, Eric Clapton, Mariah Carey, and Jennifer Lopez.

YMO also influenced techno music, including its pioneers Juan Atkins, Kevin Saunderson, and Derrick May, who cited YMO as an important influence on their work alongside Kraftwerk. YMO continued to influence later techno musicians such as Surgeon, μ-Ziq, and Cosmic Baby. &quot;Technopolis&quot; (1979) in particular is considered an &quot;interesting contribution&quot; to the development of Detroit techno and the group Cybotron. &quot;Computer Game&quot; (1978) also influenced Sheffield&#x27;s bleep techno music; the Warp record, Sweet Exorcist&#x27;s &quot;Testone&quot; (1990), defined Sheffield&#x27;s techno sound by making playful use of sampled sounds from &quot;Computer Game&quot; along with dialogues from the film &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). &quot;Computer Game&quot; (1978) was later included in Carl Craig&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Kings of Techno&quot; (2006).

In the 1990s, YMO influenced ambient house pioneers such as The Orb and 808 State, as well as Ultramarine and other ambient/house artists. This resulted in the release of the tribute remix album &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra: Hi-Tech/No Crime&quot; in 1993, by leading ambient, house and techno musicians at the time, including The Orb, 808 State, and Orbital. The music YMO produced during their comeback in the early 1990s also played an instrumental role in the techno and acid house movements towards the end of the 20th century. The band&#x27;s use of oriental musical scales and video game sounds has continued to be an influence on 21st-century electronica acts such as Dizzee Rascal, Kieran Hebden, and Ikonika.

YMO&#x27;s success with music technology encouraged many others, with their influence strongly felt in the British electronic scene of the early 1980s in particular. They influenced many early British synthpop acts, including Ultravox, John Foxx, Gary Numan, Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, Camouflage, OMD, The Human League, Visage, and Art of Noise, as well as American rock musicians such as Todd Rundgren.

&quot;Technopolis&quot;, a tribute to Tokyo as an electronic mecca that used the term &quot;techno&quot; in its title, foreshadowed concepts that Juan Atkins and Rick Davis would later have with Cybotron.

===Hip hop===
The band was popular with the emerging hip hop community, which appreciated the group&#x27;s new electronic sounds, and in the Bronx where &quot;Firecracker&quot; was a success and sampled in the famous &quot;Death Mix&quot; by Afrika Bambaataa. Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s influential song &quot;Planet Rock&quot; was partly inspired by YMO. The &quot;terse videogame-funk&quot; sounds of YMO&#x27;s &quot;Computer Game&quot; would have a strong influence on the emerging electro and hip hop genres. Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; was cited by Kurtis Mantronik as a major influence on his early electro hip hop group Mantronix; he included both &quot;Computer Game&quot; and &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; in his compilation album &quot;That&#x27;s My Beat&quot; (2002) which consists of the songs that influenced his early career. The song was also later included in Playgroup&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Kings of Electro&quot; (2007), alongside later electro classics such as Hashim&#x27;s &quot;Al-Nafyish&quot; (1983). The 1980 release of &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; was also listed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music.

YMO&#x27;s use of video game sounds and bleeps also had a particularly big influence on 1980s hip hop and pop music. Beyond electro acts, &quot;Computer Game / Firecracker&quot; was also sampled by a number of other later artists, including 2 Live Crew&#x27;s &quot;Mega-Mixx II&quot; (1987), De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;Funky Towel&quot; (for the 1996 film &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot;), Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Real&quot; (2001), and the original unreleased version of Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Loverboy&quot; (2001).

===Japan===
The band has also been very influential in its homeland Japan, where they had become the most popular group during the late 1970s and 1980s. Their albums &quot;Solid State Survivor&quot; and &quot;X∞Multiplies&quot; held the top two spots on the Oricon charts for seven consecutive weeks in 1980, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat. Young fans of their music during this period became known as the . 

The band significantly affected Japanese pop music, which started becoming increasingly dominated by electronic and computer music due to YMO&#x27;s influence. YMO were one of the most important acts in Japan&#x27;s &quot;New Music&quot; movement and paved the way for the emergence of contemporary J-pop in the 1980s. They also inspired early ambient techno artists such as Tetsu Inoue, and the classical music composer Joe Hisaishi. The manga author Akira Toriyama, creator of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, cited Yellow Magic Orchestra as his favorite music band in a 1980 interview.

===Video games===
YMO also influenced many video game composers and significantly affected the sounds used in much of the chiptune and video game music produced during the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. In 1994, four video game composers employed at Namco formed a parody band called Oriental Magnetic Yellow (OMY), producing parody cover versions of various YMO records, consisting of Shinji Hosoe as Haruomi Hosonoe, Nobuyoshi Sano as Ryuichi Sanomoto, Takayuki Aihara as Takayukihiro Aihara, and Hiroto Sasaki as Hideki Sasatake.

<text>Taiwan Sign Language (TSL; ) is the sign language most commonly used by the deaf and hard of hearing in Taiwan.

==History==
The beginnings of Taiwan Sign Language date from 1895.

The origins of TSL developed from Japanese Sign Language during Japanese rule. TSL is considered part of the Japanese Sign Language family.

TSL has some mutual intelligibility with both Japanese Sign Language and Korean Sign Language; it has about a 60% lexical similarity with JSL.
There are two main dialects of TSL centered on two of the three major sign language schools in Taiwan: one in Taipei, the other in Tainan City. There is a variant based in Taichung, but this sign language is essentially the same as the Tainan school.

After the ROC took over Taiwan, Taiwan absorbed an influx of Chinese Sign Language users from China who influenced TSL through teaching methods and loanwords.

Serious linguistic research into TSL began in the 1970s and is continuing at present. The first International Symposium on Taiwan Sign Language Linguistics was held on March 1–2, 2003, at National Chung Cheng University in Minxiong, Chiayi, Taiwan.

== Functional markers ==
TSL, like other sign languages, incorporates nonmanual markers with lexical, syntactic, discourse, and affective functions. These include brow raising and furrowing, frowning, head shaking and nodding, and leaning and shifting the torso.

== In popular culture ==
The 2020 psychological-thriller The Silent Forest uses a large amount of the Taipei variant of TSL in the dialogue.

<doc id="185416" wikidata="Q1326340" url="?curid=185416" title="Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album is presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement in comedy.&quot; The award was awarded yearly from 1959 to 1993 and then from 2004 to present day.

==History==
There have been several minor changes to the name of the award over this time:

*From 1959 to 1967 it was Best Comedy Performance
*From 1968 to 1991 it was known as Best Comedy Recording
*From 1992 to 1993 and from 2004 to the present day it was awarded as Best Comedy Album

In 1960 and 1961 two separate awards were presented for the best spoken and for the best musical comedy performance.

In 1994, after four consecutive years of wins by classical music comedy albums, the award was restricted to spoken word comedy albums and moved into the &quot;spoken&quot; field. From then through 2003, it was awarded as the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Comedy Album.

In 2004 the award was reinstated within the comedy field as the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album, once again allowing musical comedy works to be considered.

Bill Cosby holds the record for most consecutive wins, with six earned between 1965 and 1970. Peter Schickele (of P.D.Q. Bach fame) is the runner-up, with four wins between 1990 and 1993.

==Recipients==

<text>The SVNS, known as the [[HSBC]] SVNS for sponsorship reasons, is an annual series of international rugby sevens tournaments run by World Rugby featuring national sevens teams. Organised for the first time in the 1999–2000 season as the IRB World Sevens Series, the competition was formed to promote an elite-level of international rugby sevens and develop the game into a viable commercial product. The competition has been sponsored by banking group HSBC since 2014.

The season&#x27;s circuit consists of eight tournaments held in five continents, generally beginning in November or December and ending in May or June. All tournaments feature the same 12 teams.

Teams compete for the World Rugby Series title by accumulating points based on their finishing position in each tournament. The bottom four teams play a repechange tournament against the top four teams of the World Rugby Sevens Challenger Series.

New Zealand had originally dominated the Series, winning each of the first six seasons from 1999–2000 to 2004–05, but since then, Fiji, South Africa, Samoa and Australia have each won season titles. England, Argentina and the United States have placed in the top three for several seasons but have not won the series title.

The International Olympic Committee&#x27;s decision in 2009 to add rugby sevens to the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016 has added a boost to rugby sevens and to the World Sevens Series; this boost has led to increased exposure and revenues, leading several of the core teams to field fully professional squads.

==History==
===International sevens===
The first international rugby sevens tournament was held in 1973 in Scotland, which was celebrating a century of the Scottish Rugby Union. Seven international teams took part, with England defeating Ireland 22–18 in the final to take the trophy. The Hong Kong Sevens annual tournament began in 1976. Over the next two decades the number of international sevens competitions increased. The most notable was the Rugby World Cup Sevens with Scotland hosting the inaugural event in 1993, along with rugby joining the Commonwealth Games program in 1998.

===World Series early years===

The first season of the World Sevens Series was the 1999–2000 season. At the Series launch, the chairman of the International Rugby Board, Vernon Pugh, described the IRB&#x27;s vision of the role of this new competition: &quot;this competition has set in place another important element in the IRB’s drive to establish rugby as a truly global sport, one with widespread visibility and steadily improving standards of athletic excellence.&quot; New Zealand and Fiji dominated the first series, meeting in the final in eight of the ten season tournaments, and New Zealand narrowly won, overtaking Fiji by winning the last tournament of the series.

New Zealand won the first six seasons in a row from 1999–2000 to 2004–05, led by players such as Karl Te Nana and Amasio Valence. The number of stops in the series varied over the seasons, but experienced a contraction from 11 tournaments in 2001–02 to 7 tournaments in 2002–03 due to the global recession. In the 2005–06 season Fiji clinched the season trophy on the last tournament of the season finishing ahead of England. New Zealand regained the trophy in 2006–07 season in the last tournament of the season.

South Africa was the next team to win the series after taking home the 2008–09 title. In the 2009–10 season, Samoa who finished seventh the previous year shocked the world – led by 2010 top try-scorer and World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year Mikaele Pesamino – by winning four of the last five tournaments to overtake New Zealand and win the series.

===Olympic era and professionalism===
The number of core teams expanded from 12 to 15 for the 2011–12 series. Qualification for these places was played out at the 2012 Hong Kong Sevens. Canada (returning to core status for the first time since 2008), Spain and Portugal joined the 12 core teams for the next season. The Japan event also made a return for the first time since 2001 (lasting until 2015). New Zealand continued their dominance by finishing on top.

Argentina was originally planned to begin hosting a tenth event with Mar Del Plata the venue in the 2012–13 season, giving the tour an event on each continent, but when Argentina joined the Rugby Championship those plans were shelved. With the same schedule, New Zealand again were the winners over South Africa. They took it again in 2013–14 with Spain the first team to be relegated after finishing last during that season with Japan replacing them.

Heading into the 2014–15 season, the top four teams qualifying to the 2016 Summer Olympics, with Fiji, South Africa, New Zealand and Great Britain all qualifying through. The 2014–15 season and 2015–16 season were won by Fiji – the first time a team other than New Zealand won back-to-back season titles – led by 2015 and 2016 season Dream Team nominee Osea Kolinisau The two seasons also yielded teams winning their first tournaments – the United States won the 2015 London Sevens to finish the season in sixth overall; Kenya won the 2016 Singapore Sevens, and Scotland won the 2016 London Sevens. Prior to the 2015–16 season World Rugby did a comprehensive review of all nine tournament hosts and adjusted the schedule, dropping two sites (Japan and Scotland), and adding three sites (France, Singapore and Canada) to the calendar.

In the 2016–17 series, a dominant and consistent display by South Africa saw them reach the finals of the 2016–17 series rounds on eight occasions, winning five of these. As a result, South Africa were series champions with victory in the penultimate round in Paris. The season was a qualifier for the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens with the top four teams that had not already qualified, coming from this season. The teams that made it through to the World Cup via this method were Canada, Argentina, Scotland and Samoa.

== Tournament hosts ==
The World Series will consist of seven scheduled tournament stops from the 2024–25 season, which generally fall in the same order and timeframes. From 2020 to 2022, however, several of these events had to be cancelled due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.


=== Notes ===
==Teams, promotion and relegation==

===Core teams===
A group of core teams, currently 12 in number, is announced for each season based on performances in the previous season. Each core team has a guaranteed place in all of that season&#x27;s events. The core teams have been selected through a designated promotion/relegation process since the 2012–13 season. A new system from the 2023–24 season, will see 12 core teams, with up to 4 being relegated each year.

Key: * indicates a tied placing

;Notes
=== Invited teams ===
Non-core teams are also invited to compete in every season of the World Rugby Sevens Series under previous formats. With 15 core teams, there was generally only one invited team at each 16-team tournament. Before 2012–13, when there were only 12 core teams, four places at each tournament were usually available to invited teams.
Key: * indicates a tied placing

===Promotion and relegation===
In 2019, World Rugby announced a plan to create a second-tier competition that would allow the best thirteen sevens teams, with the addition of three invited teams, from their region to compete in a similar style format to the Sevens Series for the potential of gaining promotion to the World Rugby Sevens Series and becoming a core team. This breaks from the usual format of promotion and relegation in the sevens series.

From 2013–14 series to 2018–19 the promotion/relegation was as follows:
* One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year.
* The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated.
* The team that wins the 12-team qualifying tournament at the Hong Kong Sevens is promoted.

From 2020 to 2023 the style of promotion/relegation was as such:

* One team is relegated and one team is promoted each year.
* The core team that finishes bottom of the table at the end of the season series is relegated to the Challenger Series.
* Eight teams will compete for promotion in the Hong Kong Sevens event after qualifying through the Challenger Series.

From 2024 onwards the style of promotion/relegation will be as such:

* Teams ranked 9–12 will play in the promotion/relegation part of the grand final where they will be joined by the top 4 teams from the Challenger Series
* Top 4 teams from this event are promoted to the SVNS Series
* The bottom 4 teams are relegated to the Challenger Series
;Notes
===Other qualifying===
The World Series results are sometimes used as a qualifier for other tournaments. For example, the top four teams of the 2014–15 series automatically qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Similarly, certain teams from the 2016–17 series qualified for the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens.

== Format ==
Rugby sevens is a fast-paced version of rugby union with seven players each side on a full-sized rugby field. Games are much shorter, lasting seven minutes each half. The game is quicker and faster-scoring than 15-a-side rugby, which explains part of its appeal. It also gives players the space for superb feats of individual skill. Sevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format. Currently, in a normal event, 16 teams are entered.

World Rugby operates satellite tournaments in each continent alongside the Sevens World Series which serve as qualifiers for Series events; in 2012–13 they also determined the entrants in the World Series Pre-Qualifier, and since 2013–14 determine the entrants in the Core Team Qualifier.

In each tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss, 0 for a no-show. In case teams are tied after pool play, the tiebreakers are:

#Head-to-head result between the tied teams.
#Difference in points scored and allowed during pool play.
#Difference in tries scored and allowed during pool play.
#Points scored during pool play.
#Coin toss.

As of the 2009–10 series, four trophies are awarded in each tournament. In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.

In a normal event, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third and fourth-place finishers in each pool, while the Shield is contested by the losing quarterfinalists of the Bowl.

A third-place match is now conducted between the losing Cup semifinalists in all tournaments; this was introduced for the 2011–12 series.

In 2012–13, the season-ending London Sevens expanded to 20 teams, with 12 competing for series points and eight involved in the Core Team Qualifier. With the promotion place now determined at the Hong Kong Sevens, the London Sevens returned to the traditional 16-team format in 2013–14.

The 2024 Rugby Perth Sevens features nine men&#x27;s and six women&#x27;s rounds over six months. The calendar includes stopovers in many of the usual destinations, from London to Langford, plus three new cities (Malaga, Seville and Toulouse) to replace traditional hosts Australia and New Zealand.

===Hong Kong 7s===
The Hong Kong Sevens (an anomaly as a three-day event) is the most famous sevens tournament.
The Hong Kong Sevens had 24 teams through the 2011–12 series, but has featured 28 teams since 2012–13, with 15 core teams and the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series competing for series points. At the 2013 event, the remaining 12 teams were those in the World Series Pre-Qualifier; from 2014 forward, the remaining 12 teams are those in the Core Team Qualifier.
In Hong Kong, the Shield was awarded for the first time in 2010.

Originally, the six pool winners of the Hong Kong Sevens, plus the two highest-finishing second-place teams, advanced to the Cup.

In 2010 and 2011, a different system was used:
* The losing quarterfinalists in the Cup competition contested the Plate competition.
* The four remaining second-place teams and the four best third-place teams, which contested the Plate in previous years, competed for the Bowl.
* The remaining eight teams in the competition, which contested the Bowl in previous years, competed for the Shield.

In the transitional year of 2012, the Hong Kong Sevens was split into two separate competitions. The 12 core teams competed for the Cup, Plate and Bowl under a format similar to that of a regular event. The 12 invited teams all competed for the Shield, with the top three sides in that competition also earning core status for 2012–13.

From 2013 on, the Hong Kong Sevens was played under the same 16-team format used in the rest of the series, with typically 15 core teams plus an invited team (for Hong Kong, usually the winner of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series) competing in the main draw of the tournament. In line with changes which began at the start of the 2016–17 World Rugby Sevens Series, the duration of the Cup final was reduced from 20 minutes to 14 minutes in 2017. In that season, the number of trophies was also reduced to two; the main Cup contested by the top eight teams from the pool stage, and a Challenge Trophy contested by the bottom eight teams from the pool stage.

=== Points schedule ===
The season championship is determined by points earned in each tournament. World Rugby introduced a new scoring system for the 2011–12 series, in which all teams participating in a tournament are guaranteed points. Initially, World Rugby announced the new points schedule only for the standard 16-team events; the allocations for the Hong Kong Sevens were announced later. A new scoring system was introduced in 2019–20 requiring teams to play for 7th, 11th and 15th places, previously teams had tied for 7th–8th 11th–12th and 15th–16th places.

The points schedule used at each standard event until 2023 is summarised below.

From 2023–24 the following points schedule is used for each event:


Tie-breaking: If two or more teams are level on overall series points, the following tie-breakers are used:
#Overall difference in points scored and allowed during the season.
#Total try count during the season.
#If neither of the above produces a winner, the teams are considered tied.

===TV and media===

The tour received 1,147 hours of air time in 2005–06; 530 of which was live, and was broadcast to 136 countries. By 2008–09, the hours of air time had increased to over 3,300, with 35 broadcasters airing the series in 139 countries and 15 languages. Broadcast time increased further in 2009–10, with 3,561 hours of air time (1,143 hours live) carried by 34 broadcasters in 141 countries and 16 languages. In 2010–11, 3,657 hours of coverage were aired (1,161 hours live), with the same number of broadcasters as the previous season but six new countries added. For that season, Sevens World Series programming was available in 332 million homes worldwide, with a potential audience of 760 million.

===Sponsorship===
The International Rugby Board reached a 5-year deal with HSBC in October 2010 that granted them status as the first-ever title sponsor of the Sevens World Series. Through the agreement, HSBC acquired title naming rights to all tournaments in the World Series, beginning with the Dubai Sevens on 3 December 2010. HSBC has since sub-licensed the naming rights to individual tournaments, while retaining its name sponsorship of the overall series. A renewed, 4-year deal was announced before the 2015–16 Series, this deal was also expanded to include the World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series.

==Player contracts and salaries==
In the year after the International Olympic Committee announced in 2009 that rugby sevens would return to the Olympics in 2016, most of the &quot;core teams&quot; on the Series began offering full-time contracts to their players. These annual salaries can range from €18,000 to €100,000. England offers among the more generous salaries, ranging from an estimated €25,000 to over €100,000. New Zealand has a graded system with salaries ranging from €23,000-plus to about €52,500 for its four top earners. The basic salary for Scottish sevens players ranges from €22,500 to €40,000. The Australian sevens players are estimated to be on a basic salary of about €27,000-plus. Toward the bottom end of the scale is Ireland, offering its players a €18,000 to €23,750 development contract, less than minimum wage.

<text>In mathematics, a function from a set to a set assigns to each element of exactly one element of . The set is called the domain of the function and the set is called the codomain of the function.

Functions were originally the idealization of how a varying quantity depends on another quantity. For example, the position of a planet is a &quot;function&quot; of time. Historically, the concept was elaborated with the infinitesimal calculus at the end of the 17th century, and, until the 19th century, the functions that were considered were differentiable (that is, they had a high degree of regularity). The concept of a function was formalized at the end of the 19th century in terms of set theory, and this greatly increased the possible applications of the concept.

A function is often denoted by a letter such as , or . The value of a function at an element of its domain (that is, the element of the codomain that is associated with ) is denoted by ; for example, the value of at is denoted by . Commonly, a specific function is defined by means of an expression depending on , such as formula_1 in this case, some computation, called , may be needed for deducing the value of the function at a particular value; for example, if formula_2 then formula_3

Given its domain and its codomain, a function is uniquely represented by the set of all pairs , called the &quot;graph of the function&quot;, a popular means of illustrating the function. When the domain and the codomain are sets of real numbers, each such pair may be thought of as the Cartesian coordinates of a point in the plane.

Functions are widely used in science, engineering, and in most fields of mathematics. It has been said that functions are &quot;the central objects of investigation&quot; in most fields of mathematics.

The concept of a function has evolved significantly over centuries, from its informal origins in ancient mathematics to its formalization in the 19th century. See History of the function concept for details.

== Definition ==


A function from a set to a set is an assignment of one element of to each element of . The set is called the domain of the function and the set is called the codomain of the function.

If the element in is assigned to in by the function , one says that &quot;maps&quot; to , and this is commonly written formula_4 In this notation, is the &quot;argument&quot; or &quot;variable&quot; of the function.

A specific element of is a &quot;value of the variable&quot;, and the corresponding element of is the &quot;value of the function&quot; at , or the image of under the function. The &quot;image of a function&quot;, sometimes called its range, is the set of the images of all elements in the domain.

A function , its domain , and its codomain are often specified by the notation formula_5 One may write formula_6 instead of formula_7, where the symbol formula_8 (read &#x27;maps to&#x27;) is used to specify where a particular element in the domain is mapped to by . This allows the definition of a function without naming. For example, the square function is the function formula_9

The domain and codomain are not always explicitly given when a function is defined. In particular, it is common that one might only know, without some (possibly difficult) computation, that the domain of a specific function is contained in a larger set. For example, if formula_10 is a real function, the determination of the domain of the function formula_11 requires knowing the zeros of This is one of the reasons for which, in mathematical analysis, &quot;a function may refer to a function having a proper subset of as a domain. For example, a &quot;function from the reals to the reals&quot; may refer to a real-valued function of a real variable whose domain is a proper subset of the real numbers, typically a subset that contains a non-empty open interval. Such a function is then called a partial function.

A function on a set means a function from the domain , without specifying a codomain. However, some authors use it as shorthand for saying that the function is .

=== Formal definition ===


The above definition of a function is essentially that of the founders of calculus, Leibniz, Newton and Euler. However, it cannot be formalized, since there is no mathematical definition of an &quot;assignment&quot;. It is only at the end of the 19th century that the first formal definition of a function could be provided, in terms of set theory. This set-theoretic definition is based on the fact that a function establishes a &quot;relation&quot; between the elements of the domain and some (possibly all) elements of the codomain. Mathematically, a binary relation between two sets and is a subset of the set of all ordered pairs formula_12 such that formula_13 and formula_14 The set of all these pairs is called the Cartesian product of and and denoted formula_15 Thus, the above definition may be formalized as follows.

A &quot;function&quot; with domain and codomain is a binary relation between and that satisfies the two following conditions:
* For every formula_16 in formula_17 there exists formula_18 in formula_19 such that formula_20
* If formula_21 and formula_22 then formula_23

This definition may be rewritten more formally, without referring explicitly to the concept of a relation, but using more notation (including set-builder notation):

A function is formed by three sets, the &quot;domain&quot; formula_24 the &quot;codomain&quot; formula_25 and the &quot;graph&quot; formula_26 that satisfy the three following conditions. 
*formula_27
*formula_28
*formula_29

=== Partial functions ===
Partial functions are defined similarly to ordinary functions, with the &quot;total&quot; condition removed. That is, a &quot;partial function&quot; from to is a binary relation between and such that, for every formula_30 there is &quot;at most one&quot; in such that formula_31

Using functional notation, this means that, given formula_30 either formula_33 is in , or it is undefined.

The set of the elements of such that formula_33 is defined and belongs to is called the &quot;domain of definition&quot; of the function. A partial function from to is thus a ordinary function that has as its domain a subset of called the domain of definition of the function. If the domain of definition equals , one often says that the partial function is a &quot;total function&quot;.

In several areas of mathematics the term &quot;function&quot; refers to partial functions rather than to ordinary functions. This is typically the case when functions may be specified in a way that makes difficult or even impossible to determine their domain.

In calculus, a &quot;real-valued function of a real variable&quot; or &quot;real function&quot; is a partial function from the set formula_35 of the real numbers to itself. Given a real function formula_36 its multiplicative inverse formula_11 is also a real function. The determination of the domain of definition of a multiplicative inverse of a (partial) function amounts to compute the zeros of the function, the values where the function is defined but not its multiplicative inverse.

Similarly, a &quot;function of a complex variable&quot; is generally a partial function with a domain of definition included in the set formula_38 of the complex numbers. The difficulty of determining the domain of definition of a complex function is illustrated by the multiplicative inverse of the Riemann zeta function: the determination of the domain of definition of the function formula_39 is more or less equivalent to the proof or disproof of one of the major open problems in mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis. 

In computability theory, a general recursive function is a partial function from the integers to the integers whose values can be computed by an algorithm (roughly speaking). The domain of definition of such a function is the set of inputs for which the algorithm does not run forever. A fundamental theorem of computability theory is that there cannot exist an algorithm that takes an arbitrary general recursive function as input and tests whether belongs to its domain of definition (see Halting problem).

=== Multivariate functions ===

A multivariate function, multivariable function, or function of several variables is a function that depends on several arguments. Such functions are commonly encountered. For example, the position of a car on a road is a function of the time travelled and its average speed.

Formally, a function of variables is a function whose domain is a set of -tuples.
For example, multiplication of integers is a function of two variables, or bivariate function, whose domain is the set of all ordered pairs (2-tuples) of integers, and whose codomain is the set of integers. The same is true for every binary operation. The graph of a bivariate surface over a two-dimensional real domain may be interpreted as defining a parametric surface, as used in, e.g., bivariate interpolation.

Commonly, an -tuple is denoted enclosed between parentheses, such as in formula_40 When using functional notation, one usually omits the parentheses surrounding tuples, writing formula_41 instead of formula_42

Given sets formula_43 the set of all -tuples formula_44 such that formula_45 is called the Cartesian product of formula_43 and denoted formula_47

Therefore, a multivariate function is a function that has a Cartesian product or a proper subset of a Cartesian product as a domain.
: formula_48
where the domain has the form
: formula_49

If all the formula_50 are equal to the set formula_35 of the real numbers or to the set formula_52 of the complex numbers, one talks respectively of a function of several real variables or of a function of several complex variables.

== Notation ==

There are various standard ways for denoting functions. The most commonly used notation is functional notation, which is the first notation described below.

=== Functional notation ===
The functional notation requires that a name is given to the function, which, in the case of a unspecified function is often the letter . Then, the application of the function to an argument is denoted by its name followed by its argument (or, in the case of a multivariate functions, its arguments) enclosed between parentheses, such as in 
:formula_53
The argument between the parentheses may be a variable, often , that represents an arbitrary element of the domain of the function, a specific element of the domain ( in the above example), or an expression that can be evaluated to an element of the domain (formula_54 in the above example). The use of a unspecified variable between parentheses is useful for defining a function explicitly such as in &quot;let formula_55&quot;.

When the symbol denoting the function consists of several characters and no ambiguity may arise, the parentheses of functional notation might be omitted. For example, it is common to write instead of .

Functional notation was first used by Leonhard Euler in 1734. Some widely used functions are represented by a symbol consisting of several letters (usually two or three, generally an abbreviation of their name). In this case, a roman type is customarily used instead, such as &quot;&quot; for the sine function, in contrast to italic font for single-letter symbols.

The functional notation is often used colloquially for referring to a function and simultaneously naming its argument, such as in &quot;let formula_33 be a function&quot;. This is an abuse of notation that is useful for a simpler formulation.

=== Arrow notation ===
Arrow notation defines the rule of a function inline, without requiring a name to be given to the function. It uses the ↦ arrow symbol, pronounced &quot;maps to&quot;. For example, formula_57 is the function which takes a real number as input and outputs that number plus 1. Again, a domain and codomain of formula_35 is implied.

The domain and codomain can also be explicitly stated, for example:
: formula_59

This defines a function from the integers to the integers that returns the square of its input.

As a common application of the arrow notation, suppose formula_60 is a function in two variables, and we want to refer to a partially applied function formula_61 produced by fixing the second argument to the value without introducing a new function name. The map in question could be denoted formula_62 using the arrow notation. The expression formula_62 (read: &quot;the map taking to of comma nought&quot;) represents this new function with just one argument, whereas the expression refers to the value of the function at the 

=== Index notation ===

Index notation may be used instead of functional notation. That is, instead of writing , one writes formula_64

This is typically the case for functions whose domain is the set of the natural numbers. Such a function is called a sequence, and, in this case the element formula_65 is called the th element of the sequence.

The index notation can also be used for distinguishing some variables called &quot;parameters&quot; from the &quot;true variables&quot;. In fact, parameters are specific variables that are considered as being fixed during the study of a problem. For example, the map formula_66 (see above) would be denoted formula_67 using index notation, if we define the collection of maps formula_67 by the formula formula_69 for all formula_70.

=== Dot notation ===

In the notation
formula_71
the symbol does not represent any value; it is simply a placeholder, meaning that, if is replaced by any value on the left of the arrow, it should be replaced by the same value on the right of the arrow. Therefore, may be replaced by any symbol, often an interpunct &quot;&quot;. This may be useful for distinguishing the function from its value at .

For example, formula_72 may stand for the function formula_73, and formula_74 may stand for a function defined by an integral with variable upper bound: formula_75.

=== Specialized notations ===
There are other, specialized notations for functions in sub-disciplines of mathematics. For example, in linear algebra and functional analysis, linear forms and the vectors they act upon are denoted using a dual pair to show the underlying duality. This is similar to the use of bra–ket notation in quantum mechanics. In logic and the theory of computation, the function notation of lambda calculus is used to explicitly express the basic notions of function abstraction and application. In category theory and homological algebra, networks of functions are described in terms of how they and their compositions commute with each other using commutative diagrams that extend and generalize the arrow notation for functions described above.

===Functions of more than one variable===
In some cases the argument of a function may be an ordered pair of elements taken from some set or sets. For example, a function can be defined as mapping any pair of real numbers formula_12 to the sum of their squares, formula_77. Such a function is commonly written as formula_78 and referred to as &quot;a function of two variables&quot;. Likewise one can have a function of three or more variables, with notations such as formula_79, formula_80.

== Other terms ==


A function may also be called a map or a mapping, but some authors make a distinction between the term &quot;map&quot; and &quot;function&quot;. For example, the term &quot;map&quot; is often reserved for a &quot;function&quot; with some sort of special structure (e.g. maps of manifolds). In particular &quot;map&quot; may be used in place of &quot;homomorphism&quot; for the sake of succinctness (e.g., linear map or &quot;map from to &quot; instead of &quot;group homomorphism from to &quot;). Some authors reserve the word &quot;mapping&quot; for the case where the structure of the codomain belongs explicitly to the definition of the function.

Some authors, such as Serge Lang, use &quot;function&quot; only to refer to maps for which the codomain is a subset of the real or complex numbers, and use the term &quot;mapping&quot; for more general functions.

In the theory of dynamical systems, a map denotes an evolution function used to create discrete dynamical systems. See also Poincaré map.

Whichever definition of &quot;map&quot; is used, related terms like &quot;domain&quot;, &quot;codomain&quot;, &quot;injective&quot;, &quot;continuous&quot; have the same meaning as for a function.

== Specifying a function ==
Given a function formula_81, by definition, to each element formula_16 of the domain of the function formula_81, there is a unique element associated to it, the value formula_33 of formula_81 at formula_16. There are several ways to specify or describe how formula_16 is related to formula_33, both explicitly and implicitly. Sometimes, a theorem or an axiom asserts the existence of a function having some properties, without describing it more precisely. Often, the specification or description is referred to as the definition of the function formula_81.

=== By listing function values ===
On a finite set a function may be defined by listing the elements of the codomain that are associated to the elements of the domain. For example, if formula_90, then one can define a function formula_91 by formula_92

=== By a formula ===
Functions are often defined by an expression that describes a combination of arithmetic operations and previously defined functions; such a formula allows computing the value of the function from the value of any element of the domain.
For example, in the above example, formula_81 can be defined by the formula formula_94, for formula_95.

When a function is defined this way, the determination of its domain is sometimes difficult. If the formula that defines the function contains divisions, the values of the variable for which a denominator is zero must be excluded from the domain; thus, for a complicated function, the determination of the domain passes through the computation of the zeros of auxiliary functions. Similarly, if square roots occur in the definition of a function from formula_96 to formula_97 the domain is included in the set of the values of the variable for which the arguments of the square roots are nonnegative.

For example, formula_98 defines a function formula_99 whose domain is formula_97 because formula_101 is always positive if is a real number. On the other hand, formula_102 defines a function from the reals to the reals whose domain is reduced to the interval . (In old texts, such a domain was called the &quot;domain of definition&quot; of the function.)

Functions can be classified by the nature of formulas that define them:
* A quadratic function is a function that may be written formula_103 where are constants.
* More generally, a polynomial function is a function that can be defined by a formula involving only additions, subtractions, multiplications, and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers. For example, formula_104 and formula_105 are polynomial functions of formula_16.
* A rational function is the same, with divisions also allowed, such as formula_107 and formula_108
* An algebraic function is the same, with th roots and roots of polynomials also allowed.
* An elementary function is the same, with logarithms and exponential functions allowed.

=== Inverse and implicit functions ===
A function formula_109 with domain and codomain , is bijective, if for every in , there is one and only one element in such that . In this case, the inverse function of is the function formula_110 that maps formula_111 to the element formula_13 such that . For example, the natural logarithm is a bijective function from the positive real numbers to the real numbers. It thus has an inverse, called the exponential function, that maps the real numbers onto the positive numbers.

If a function formula_113 is not bijective, it may occur that one can select subsets formula_114 and formula_115 such that the restriction of to is a bijection from to , and has thus an inverse. The inverse trigonometric functions are defined this way. For example, the cosine function induces, by restriction, a bijection from the interval onto the interval , and its inverse function, called arccosine, maps onto . The other inverse trigonometric functions are defined similarly.

More generally, given a binary relation between two sets and , let be a subset of such that, for every formula_116 there is some formula_111 such that . If one has a criterion allowing selecting such a for every formula_116 this defines a function formula_119 called an implicit function, because it is implicitly defined by the relation .

For example, the equation of the unit circle formula_120 defines a relation on real numbers. If there are two possible values of , one positive and one negative. For , these two values become both equal to 0. Otherwise, there is no possible value of . This means that the equation defines two implicit functions with domain and respective codomains and .

In this example, the equation can be solved in , giving formula_121 but, in more complicated examples, this is impossible. For example, the relation formula_122 defines as an implicit function of , called the Bring radical, which has formula_123 as domain and range. The Bring radical cannot be expressed in terms of the four arithmetic operations and th roots.

The implicit function theorem provides mild differentiability conditions for existence and uniqueness of an implicit function in the neighborhood of a point.

=== Using differential calculus ===
Many functions can be defined as the antiderivative of another function. This is the case of the natural logarithm, which is the antiderivative of that is 0 for . Another common example is the error function.

More generally, many functions, including most special functions, can be defined as solutions of differential equations. The simplest example is probably the exponential function, which can be defined as the unique function that is equal to its derivative and takes the value 1 for .

Power series can be used to define functions on the domain in which they converge. For example, the exponential function is given by formula_124. However, as the coefficients of a series are quite arbitrary, a function that is the sum of a convergent series is generally defined otherwise, and the sequence of the coefficients is the result of some computation based on another definition. Then, the power series can be used to enlarge the domain of the function. Typically, if a function for a real variable is the sum of its Taylor series in some interval, this power series allows immediately enlarging the domain to a subset of the complex numbers, the disc of convergence of the series. Then analytic continuation allows enlarging further the domain for including almost the whole complex plane. This process is the method that is generally used for defining the logarithm, the exponential and the trigonometric functions of a complex number.

=== By recurrence ===

Functions whose domain are the nonnegative integers, known as sequences, are sometimes defined by recurrence relations.

The factorial function on the nonnegative integers (formula_125) is a basic example, as it can be defined by the recurrence relation
: formula_126
and the initial condition
: formula_127

== Representing a function ==

A graph is commonly used to give an intuitive picture of a function. As an example of how a graph helps to understand a function, it is easy to see from its graph whether a function is increasing or decreasing. Some functions may also be represented by bar charts.

=== Graphs and plots ===


Given a function formula_109 its &quot;graph&quot; is, formally, the set
: formula_129

In the frequent case where and are subsets of the real numbers (or may be identified with such subsets, e.g. intervals), an element formula_130 may be identified with a point having coordinates in a 2-dimensional coordinate system, e.g. the Cartesian plane. Parts of this may create a plot that represents (parts of) the function. The use of plots is so ubiquitous that they too are called the &quot;graph of the function&quot;. Graphic representations of functions are also possible in other coordinate systems. For example, the graph of the square function
: formula_131
consisting of all points with coordinates formula_132 for formula_133 yields, when depicted in Cartesian coordinates, the well known parabola. If the same quadratic function formula_131 with the same formal graph, consisting of pairs of numbers, is plotted instead in polar coordinates formula_135 the plot obtained is Fermat&#x27;s spiral.

=== Tables ===

A function can be represented as a table of values. If the domain of a function is finite, then the function can be completely specified in this way. For example, the multiplication function formula_136 defined as formula_137 can be represented by the familiar multiplication table

On the other hand, if a function&#x27;s domain is continuous, a table can give the values of the function at specific values of the domain. If an intermediate value is needed, interpolation can be used to estimate the value of the function. For example, a portion of a table for the sine function might be given as follows, with values rounded to 6 decimal places:

Before the advent of handheld calculators and personal computers, such tables were often compiled and published for functions such as logarithms and trigonometric functions.

=== Bar chart ===

A bar chart can represent a function whose domain is a finite set, the natural numbers, or the integers. In this case, an element of the domain is represented by an interval of the -axis, and the corresponding value of the function, , is represented by a rectangle whose base is the interval corresponding to and whose height is (possibly negative, in which case the bar extends below the -axis).

== General properties ==

This section describes general properties of functions, that are independent of specific properties of the domain and the codomain.

=== Standard functions ===
There are a number of standard functions that occur frequently:
* For every set , there is a unique function, called the , or empty map, from the empty set to . The graph of an empty function is the empty set. The existence of empty functions is needed both for the coherency of the theory and for avoiding exceptions concerning the empty set in many statements. Under the usual set-theoretic definition of a function as an ordered triplet (or equivalent ones), there is exactly one empty function for each set, thus the empty function formula_138 is not equal to formula_139 if and only if formula_140, although their graphs are both the empty set.
* For every set and every singleton set , there is a unique function from to , which maps every element of to . This is a surjection (see below) unless is the empty set.
* Given a function formula_141 the &quot;canonical surjection&quot; of onto its image formula_142 is the function from to that maps to .
* For every subset of a set , the inclusion map of into is the injective (see below) function that maps every element of to itself.
* The identity function on a set , often denoted by , is the inclusion of into itself.

=== Function composition ===
Given two functions formula_113 and formula_144 such that the domain of is the codomain of , their &quot;composition&quot; is the function formula_145 defined by
: formula_146

That is, the value of formula_147 is obtained by first applying to to obtain and then applying to the result to obtain . In this notation, the function that is applied first is always written on the right.

The composition formula_148 is an operation on functions that is defined only if the codomain of the first function is the domain of the second one. Even when both formula_147 and formula_150 satisfy these conditions, the composition is not necessarily commutative, that is, the functions formula_147 and formula_152 need not be equal, but may deliver different values for the same argument. For example, let and , then formula_153 and formula_154 agree just for formula_155

The function composition is associative in the sense that, if one of formula_156 and formula_157 is defined, then the other is also defined, and they are equal, that is, formula_158 Therefore, it is usual to just write formula_159

The identity functions formula_160 and formula_161 are respectively a right identity and a left identity for functions from to . That is, if is a function with domain , and codomain , one has
formula_162

=== Image and preimage ===

Let formula_5 The &quot;image&quot; under of an element of the domain is . If is any subset of , then the &quot;image&quot; of under , denoted , is the subset of the codomain consisting of all images of elements of , that is,
: formula_164

The &quot;image&quot; of is the image of the whole domain, that is, . It is also called the range of , although the term &quot;range&quot; may also refer to the codomain.

On the other hand, the &quot;inverse image&quot; or &quot;preimage&quot; under of an element of the codomain is the set of all elements of the domain whose images under equal . In symbols, the preimage of is denoted by formula_165 and is given by the equation
: formula_166
Likewise, the preimage of a subset of the codomain is the set of the preimages of the elements of , that is, it is the subset of the domain consisting of all elements of whose images belong to . It is denoted by formula_167 and is given by the equation
: formula_168
For example, the preimage of formula_169 under the square function is the set formula_170.

By definition of a function, the image of an element of the domain is always a single element of the codomain. However, the preimage formula_165 of an element of the codomain may be empty or contain any number of elements. For example, if is the function from the integers to themselves that maps every integer to 0, then formula_172.

If formula_173 is a function, and are subsets of , and and are subsets of , then one has the following properties:
* formula_174
* formula_175
* formula_176
* formula_177
* formula_178
* formula_179

The preimage by of an element of the codomain is sometimes called, in some contexts, the fiber of under .

If a function has an inverse (see below), this inverse is denoted formula_180 In this case formula_181 may denote either the image by formula_182 or the preimage by of . This is not a problem, as these sets are equal. The notation formula_183 and formula_181 may be ambiguous in the case of sets that contain some subsets as elements, such as formula_185 In this case, some care may be needed, for example, by using square brackets formula_186 for images and preimages of subsets and ordinary parentheses for images and preimages of elements.

=== Injective, surjective and bijective functions ===
Let formula_173 be a function.

The function is &quot;injective&quot; (or &quot;one-to-one&quot;, or is an &quot;injection&quot;) if for every two different elements and of . Equivalently, is injective if and only if, for every formula_188 the preimage formula_165 contains at most one element. An empty function is always injective. If is not the empty set, then is injective if and only if there exists a function formula_190 such that formula_191 that is, if has a left inverse. &quot;Proof&quot;: If is injective, for defining , one chooses an element formula_192 in (which exists as is supposed to be nonempty), and one defines by formula_193 if formula_7 and formula_195 if formula_196 Conversely, if formula_191 and formula_198 then formula_199 and thus formula_200

The function is &quot;surjective&quot; (or &quot;onto&quot;, or is a &quot;surjection&quot;) if its range formula_201 equals its codomain formula_19, that is, if, for each element formula_18 of the codomain, there exists some element formula_16 of the domain such that formula_205 (in other words, the preimage formula_165 of every formula_111 is nonempty). If, as usual in modern mathematics, the axiom of choice is assumed, then is surjective if and only if there exists a function formula_190 such that formula_209 that is, if has a right inverse. The axiom of choice is needed, because, if is surjective, one defines by formula_210 where formula_16 is an &quot;arbitrarily chosen&quot; element of formula_212

The function is &quot;bijective&quot; (or is a &quot;bijection&quot; or a &quot;one-to-one correspondence&quot;) if it is both injective and surjective. That is, is bijective if, for every formula_188 the preimage formula_165 contains exactly one element. The function is bijective if and only if it admits an inverse function, that is, a function formula_215 such that formula_216 and formula_217 (Contrarily to the case of surjections, this does not require the axiom of choice; the proof is straightforward).

Every function formula_113 may be factorized as the composition formula_219 of a surjection followed by an injection, where is the canonical surjection of onto and is the canonical injection of into . This is the &quot;canonical factorization&quot; of .

&quot;One-to-one&quot; and &quot;onto&quot; are terms that were more common in the older English language literature; &quot;injective&quot;, &quot;surjective&quot;, and &quot;bijective&quot; were originally coined as French words in the second quarter of the 20th century by the Bourbaki group and imported into English. As a word of caution, &quot;a one-to-one function&quot; is one that is injective, while a &quot;one-to-one correspondence&quot; refers to a bijective function. Also, the statement &quot; maps &quot;onto&quot; &quot; differs from &quot; maps &quot;into&quot; &quot;, in that the former implies that is surjective, while the latter makes no assertion about the nature of . In a complicated reasoning, the one letter difference can easily be missed. Due to the confusing nature of this older terminology, these terms have declined in popularity relative to the Bourbakian terms, which have also the advantage of being more symmetrical.

=== Restriction and extension ===
If formula_220 is a function and is a subset of , then the &quot;restriction&quot; of formula_81 to &quot;S&quot;, denoted formula_222, is the function from to defined by
: formula_223
for all in . Restrictions can be used to define partial inverse functions: if there is a subset of the domain of a function formula_81 such that formula_222 is injective, then the canonical surjection of formula_222 onto its image formula_227 is a bijection, and thus has an inverse function from formula_228 to . One application is the definition of inverse trigonometric functions. For example, the cosine function is injective when restricted to the interval . The image of this restriction is the interval , and thus the restriction has an inverse function from to , which is called arccosine and is denoted .

Function restriction may also be used for &quot;gluing&quot; functions together. Let formula_229 be the decomposition of as a union of subsets, and suppose that a function formula_230 is defined on each formula_231 such that for each pair formula_232 of indices, the restrictions of formula_233 and formula_234 to formula_235 are equal. Then this defines a unique function formula_220 such that formula_237 for all . This is the way that functions on manifolds are defined.

An &quot;extension&quot; of a function is a function such that is a restriction of . A typical use of this concept is the process of analytic continuation, that allows extending functions whose domain is a small part of the complex plane to functions whose domain is almost the whole complex plane.

Here is another classical example of a function extension that is encountered when studying homographies of the real line. A &quot;homography&quot; is a function formula_238 such that . Its domain is the set of all real numbers different from formula_239 and its image is the set of all real numbers different from formula_240 If one extends the real line to the projectively extended real line by including , one may extend to a bijection from the extended real line to itself by setting formula_241 and formula_242.

== In calculus ==
The idea of function, starting in the 17th century, was fundamental to the new infinitesimal calculus. At that time, only real-valued functions of a real variable were considered, and all functions were assumed to be smooth. But the definition was soon extended to functions of several variables and to functions of a complex variable. In the second half of the 19th century, the mathematically rigorous definition of a function was introduced, and functions with arbitrary domains and codomains were defined.

Functions are now used throughout all areas of mathematics. In introductory calculus, when the word &quot;function&quot; is used without qualification, it means a real-valued function of a single real variable. The more general definition of a function is usually introduced to second or third year college students with STEM majors, and in their senior year they are introduced to calculus in a larger, more rigorous setting in courses such as real analysis and complex analysis.

=== Real function ===


A &quot;real function&quot; is a real-valued function of a real variable, that is, a function whose codomain is the field of real numbers and whose domain is a set of real numbers that contains an interval. In this section, these functions are simply called &quot;functions&quot;.

The functions that are most commonly considered in mathematics and its applications have some regularity, that is they are continuous, differentiable, and even analytic. This regularity insures that these functions can be visualized by their graphs. In this section, all functions are differentiable in some interval.

Functions enjoy pointwise operations, that is, if and are functions, their sum, difference and product are functions defined by
: formula_243
The domains of the resulting functions are the intersection of the domains of and . The quotient of two functions is defined similarly by
: formula_244
but the domain of the resulting function is obtained by removing the zeros of from the intersection of the domains of and .

The polynomial functions are defined by polynomials, and their domain is the whole set of real numbers. They include constant functions, linear functions and quadratic functions. Rational functions are quotients of two polynomial functions, and their domain is the real numbers with a finite number of them removed to avoid division by zero. The simplest rational function is the function formula_245 whose graph is a hyperbola, and whose domain is the whole real line except for 0.

The derivative of a real differentiable function is a real function. An antiderivative of a continuous real function is a real function that has the original function as a derivative. For example, the function formula_246 is continuous, and even differentiable, on the positive real numbers. Thus one antiderivative, which takes the value zero for , is a differentiable function called the natural logarithm.

A real function is monotonic in an interval if the sign of formula_247 does not depend of the choice of and in the interval. If the function is differentiable in the interval, it is monotonic if the sign of the derivative is constant in the interval. If a real function is monotonic in an interval , it has an inverse function, which is a real function with domain and image . This is how inverse trigonometric functions are defined in terms of trigonometric functions, where the trigonometric functions are monotonic. Another example: the natural logarithm is monotonic on the positive real numbers, and its image is the whole real line; therefore it has an inverse function that is a bijection between the real numbers and the positive real numbers. This inverse is the exponential function.

Many other real functions are defined either by the implicit function theorem (the inverse function is a particular instance) or as solutions of differential equations. For example, the sine and the cosine functions are the solutions of the linear differential equation
: formula_248
such that
: formula_249

=== Vector-valued function ===
When the elements of the codomain of a function are vectors, the function is said to be a vector-valued function. These functions are particularly useful in applications, for example modeling physical properties. For example, the function that associates to each point of a fluid its velocity vector is a vector-valued function.

Some vector-valued functions are defined on a subset of formula_250 or other spaces that share geometric or topological properties of formula_250, such as manifolds. These vector-valued functions are given the name &quot;vector fields&quot;.

== Function space ==

In mathematical analysis, and more specifically in functional analysis, a function space is a set of scalar-valued or vector-valued functions, which share a specific property and form a topological vector space. For example, the real smooth functions with a compact support (that is, they are zero outside some compact set) form a function space that is at the basis of the theory of distributions.

Function spaces play a fundamental role in advanced mathematical analysis, by allowing the use of their algebraic and topological properties for studying properties of functions. For example, all theorems of existence and uniqueness of solutions of ordinary or partial differential equations result of the study of function spaces.

== Multi-valued functions ==

Several methods for specifying functions of real or complex variables start from a local definition of the function at a point or on a neighbourhood of a point, and then extend by continuity the function to a much larger domain. Frequently, for a starting point formula_252 there are several possible starting values for the function.

For example, in defining the square root as the inverse function of the square function, for any positive real number formula_252 there are two choices for the value of the square root, one of which is positive and denoted formula_254 and another which is negative and denoted formula_255 These choices define two continuous functions, both having the nonnegative real numbers as a domain, and having either the nonnegative or the nonpositive real numbers as images. When looking at the graphs of these functions, one can see that, together, they form a single smooth curve. It is therefore often useful to consider these two square root functions as a single function that has two values for positive , one value for 0 and no value for negative .

In the preceding example, one choice, the positive square root, is more natural than the other. This is not the case in general. For example, let consider the implicit function that maps to a root of formula_256 (see the figure on the right). For one may choose either formula_257 for . By the implicit function theorem, each choice defines a function; for the first one, the (maximal) domain is the interval and the image is ; for the second one, the domain is and the image is ; for the last one, the domain is and the image is . As the three graphs together form a smooth curve, and there is no reason for preferring one choice, these three functions are often considered as a single &quot;multi-valued function&quot; of that has three values for , and only one value for and .

Usefulness of the concept of multi-valued functions is clearer when considering complex functions, typically analytic functions. The domain to which a complex function may be extended by analytic continuation generally consists of almost the whole complex plane. However, when extending the domain through two different paths, one often gets different values. For example, when extending the domain of the square root function, along a path of complex numbers with positive imaginary parts, one gets for the square root of −1; while, when extending through complex numbers with negative imaginary parts, one gets . There are generally two ways of solving the problem. One may define a function that is not continuous along some curve, called a branch cut. Such a function is called the principal value of the function. The other way is to consider that one has a &quot;multi-valued function&quot;, which is analytic everywhere except for isolated singularities, but whose value may &quot;jump&quot; if one follows a closed loop around a singularity. This jump is called the monodromy.

== In the foundations of mathematics ==

The definition of a function that is given in this article requires the concept of set, since the domain and the codomain of a function must be a set. This is not a problem in usual mathematics, as it is generally not difficult to consider only functions whose domain and codomain are sets, which are well defined, even if the domain is not explicitly defined. However, it is sometimes useful to consider more general functions.

For example, the singleton set may be considered as a function formula_258 Its domain would include all sets, and therefore would not be a set. In usual mathematics, one avoids this kind of problem by specifying a domain, which means that one has many singleton functions. However, when establishing foundations of mathematics, one may have to use functions whose domain, codomain or both are not specified, and some authors, often logicians, give precise definitions for these weakly specified functions.

These generalized functions may be critical in the development of a formalization of the foundations of mathematics. For example, Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory, is an extension of the set theory in which the collection of all sets is a class. This theory includes the replacement axiom, which may be stated as: If is a set and is a function, then is a set.

In alternative formulations of the foundations of mathematics using type theory rather than set theory, functions are taken as primitive notions rather than defined from other kinds of object. They are the inhabitants of function types, and may be constructed using expressions in the lambda calculus.

== In computer science ==

In computer programming, a function is, in general, a piece of a computer program, which implements the abstract concept of function. That is, it is a program unit that produces an output for each input. However, in many programming languages every subroutine is called a function, even when there is no output, and when the functionality consists simply of modifying some data in the computer memory.

Functional programming is the programming paradigm consisting of building programs by using only subroutines that behave like mathematical functions. For example, codice_1 is a function that takes three functions as arguments, and, depending on the result of the first function (&quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;), returns the result of either the second or the third function. An important advantage of functional programming is that it makes easier program proofs, as being based on a well founded theory, the lambda calculus (see below).

Except for computer-language terminology, &quot;function&quot; has the usual mathematical meaning in computer science. In this area, a property of major interest is the computability of a function. For giving a precise meaning to this concept, and to the related concept of algorithm, several models of computation have been introduced, the old ones being general recursive functions, lambda calculus and Turing machine. The fundamental theorem of computability theory is that these three models of computation define the same set of computable functions, and that all the other models of computation that have ever been proposed define the same set of computable functions or a smaller one. The Church–Turing thesis is the claim that every philosophically acceptable definition of a &quot;computable function&quot; defines also the same functions.

General recursive functions are partial functions from integers to integers that can be defined from 
* constant functions, 
* successor, and
* projection functions 
via the operators
* composition, 
* primitive recursion, and 
* minimization. 
Although defined only for functions from integers to integers, they can model any computable function as a consequence of the following properties:
* a computation is the manipulation of finite sequences of symbols (digits of numbers, formulas, ...),
* every sequence of symbols may be coded as a sequence of bits,
* a bit sequence can be interpreted as the binary representation of an integer.

Lambda calculus is a theory that defines computable functions without using set theory, and is the theoretical background of functional programming. It consists of &quot;terms&quot; that are either variables, function definitions (&quot;&quot;-terms), or applications of functions to terms. Terms are manipulated through some rules, (the -equivalence, the -reduction, and the -conversion), which are the axioms of the theory and may be interpreted as rules of computation.

In its original form, lambda calculus does not include the concepts of domain and codomain of a function. Roughly speaking, they have been introduced in the theory under the name of &quot;type&quot; in typed lambda calculus. Most kinds of typed lambda calculi can define fewer functions than untyped lambda calculus.

<text>The Hong Kong Sevens () is a rugby sevens tournament held annually in Hong Kong on a weekend in late March or early April. Considered the premier tournament on the World Rugby Sevens Series competition, the Hong Kong Sevens is currently the fifth tournament on the World Series calendar (following the Canada Sevens). The tournament spans three days, beginning on a Friday and concluding on Sunday. The tournament is organised each year by the Hong Kong Rugby Union (HKRU). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 respectively. The latest Hong Kong Rugby Sevens was held on 5 to 7 April 2024.

== History ==
The season-ending Blarney Stone Sevens had traditionally been a part of the game’s program in Hong Kong, but HKRFU was affiliated to the RFU and internationally the game was controlled by the rugby powers. The Scottish Centenary at Easter 1973 had been a recent international Sevens tournament but to which only the establishment countries were invited.
The Hong Kong 7&#x27;s were originally the idea of Rodney Bentham-Wood, the Rothmans manager for SE Asia.
He originally wanted to do a 15 aside but a conversation with Tokkie Smith pointed out that a 7 aside tournament would be cheaper.
Rugby sponsorship was just being introduced and Tokkie ADC Smith, Chairman of HKRFU and worked with Ian Gow of Rothmans Hong Kong to discusse the possibility of a sponsored international rugby tournament in Hong Kong. Tokkie Smith promoted the idea to his President Vernon Roberts and to the Rugby Union Committee but on account of numbers and costs it was decided that any sponsored international tournament would need to be Sevens.

Jock Campbell of Cathay Pacific then offered to sponsor travel and the Committee led by President Vernon Roberts, Chairman Tokkie Smith, Treasurer Bob Gaff and Honorary Secretary Mike Pratt in 1975 made the decision to organize an international Sevens Tournament.

Friendly rugby countries throughout Asia and the Pacific were invited to send teams, creating the highly successful, multiracial tournament. The founding program announced: Rothmans-Cathay Pacific International Seven-a-Side Championship, 28 March 1976, at the Hong Kong Football Club, and the participating countries as Australia, Fiji, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, and Tonga with Hong Kong as the Home Team.

In view of the enormous success of the Sevens, the Rugby Union Committee determined to continue annually, and Tokkie Smith, still as Chairman, also managed the expanding tournaments in 1977 and 1978, establishing the series and changing rugby forever.

This was an important step as this was one of the first rugby tournaments that attracted commercial sponsorship. Of the countries represented in the inaugural sevens tournament, only Australia and New Zealand did not send national sides, instead being represented by the Wallaroos and the Cantabrians respectively. These two clubs met in the final where the Cantabrians won 24–8.

The series then grew into a competition with national representative sevens sides competing, and with this growth, the tournament moved to the Hong Kong Stadium in 1982.

The Hong Kong Sevens were ahead of their time, and an influential force in the modernisation of rugby union, for example, the Hong Kong Sevens were one of the first rugby union tournaments to attract major sponsorship, when Cathay Pacific sponsored the 1976 tournament. They also provided a level of cosmopolitan international competition, which tended not to exist in rugby before the first Rugby World Cup in 1987, especially since was not seen as one of the &quot;Big Eight&quot;, and other than some involvement with , the Commonwealth teams tended to be notoriously clannish. By 1986, the Hong Kong Sevens were held up as a positive example to others:

This Seven-a-Side international tournament is without a doubt the most spectacular, exotic, best organised Rugby competition of its kind in the world, and it has consistently produced the highest standard of Sevens Rugby seen anywhere.

I was not surprised on my first visit to see quality play from the Australian, New Zealand, Fijian, and British players, but I was staggered at the amazingly high quality play produced by countries I never even knew played Rugby. South Korea and Western Samoa were every bit as good as Japan and Tonga. , and found their lack of sheer size and bulk an insuperable handicap, but against each other they displayed a range of running and handling skills which demanded unqualified praise. , and the were inevitably outgunned by the teams from the major Rugby-playing nations but they still have a remarkably high level of skill which promises well for the future of the game.

The week of the Hong Kong tournament allows 24 Rugby-playing nations to intermingle for several days, and the huge cross-fertilisation of ideas can only be beneficial in the long term for the emerging nations. After the first day of the play when the top eight seeded teams meet the smaller fish in a pool system, the second day is divided into three different competitions... The strength of this great tournament is that on the opening day the most famous players in the world share a pitch with unknown opponents from countries where Rugby is a minority sport... While tournaments like the Hong Kong Sevens continue to be played, Rugby administrators can be confident that the game will continue to thrive in over 100 countries worldwide.
Bill McLaren, in his autobiography &quot;Talking of Rugby&quot; writes at length about his Hong Kong Sevens experiences:
:&quot;I remember a big South Sea islander saying that, in his view, the Hong Kong sevens were really the Olympic games of Rugby Union. Certainly, the Hong Kong event encapsulates all the really good things that the game has to offer–splendid organisation, wonderful sporting spirit, universal camaraderie, admirable field behaviour, the most enjoyable crowd participation, the chance for emergent rugby nations to lock horns with the mighty men of , , , , and the Barbarians. There is, too, scintillating running and handling which is what the game is supposed to be all about.&quot;

However, despite this apparent diversity, some of the same old problems which had dogged international rugby were still manifest in the Hong Kong Sevens in the 1980s – for example, in a photograph of the v game at the tournament in 1984, the teams do not appear to include anyone who is ethnically Arabian or Chinese, instead both teams are quite clearly of northern European ethnic origin.

In 1994, the venue was deemed too small for the tournament and was rebuilt into a 40,000-seat stadium now named the Hong Kong Stadium. New Zealand were the dominant team in the mid 1990s, winning three straight from 1994 to 1996, led by legends Eric Rush and Jonah Lomu.

Today, 24 national representative sides compete in the tournament. These include the 16 &#x27;core&#x27; members of the IRB Sevens World Series, plus eight further invited teams.

In 1997 and 2005, the Hong Kong Sevens was not held; taking its place was the Rugby World Cup Sevens, which Hong Kong hosted in both years. Fiji won both World Cup Sevens tournaments.

In 1998, the first tournament after the transfer of sovereignty to China, tickets were not sold internationally and the event was stricken with a bankrupt sponsor Peregrine. The Union&#x27;s Organising Committee worked hard, and successfully implemented its marketing strategy to get the local population involved through &quot;Friday Night is Party Night&quot; and secured CSFB as sponsors &quot;on a spur-of-the-moment&quot;, the event was a comparatively huge success. In 2011, after HSBC negotiated title sponsorship to the entire World Sevens Series tournaments, it was no longer possible for Credit Suisse to sponsor the Hong Kong leg after 14 years.

== Format ==
The Hong Kong Sevens is the sport&#x27;s most prestigious annual rugby sevens event organised as part of the World Rugby Sevens Series. Historically, it had been contested by 24 teams; all other World Series tournaments had 16 teams participating until the 2012–13 edition. The teams are divided into six pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. The winning team of the tournament acquires 30 points towards its rankings in the World Series instead of the normal 22, and the runner-up earns 25 points instead of the normal 19. Through the 2008–09 World Series, the Hong Kong Sevens awarded 24 points to the runner-up, and 16-team events offered only 20 points for the winner and 16 for the runner-up.

The 2010 edition saw several significant changes to the tournament format. Foremost among these changes was the introduction of the fourth-level Shield trophy, which had not previously been awarded in Hong Kong. More important within the context of the World Series as a whole, the Cup and Plate are now contested in the same manner as in other competitions, with the losing quarter-finalists in the Cup parachuting into the Plate semi-finals.

=== World Series qualifier ===
Further major changes were made to the event for 2013. These changes resulted from the decision of World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Board (IRB), to institute a formal promotion and relegation process for core teams (i.e., teams assured of playing in all series events) starting with the 2012–13 series.

For starters, the number of teams involved in the event increased from 24 to 28. However, only 16 of these teams compete for series points. The 15 core teams were joined in the main draw by the winner of the most recent edition of the HSBC Asian Sevens Series. The remaining 12 teams, specifically two qualifiers from each of the IRB&#x27;s six regional zones, participated in the World Series Pre-Qualifier. Like the main draw, the Pre-Qualifier grouped the entrants into four-team pools. The top two teams from each pool, plus the top two third-place teams, advanced to a quarterfinal round, with the winners of all four matches, along with the Asian Sevens Series winner, advancing to the World Series Core Team Qualifier at the London Sevens.

The IRB further changed the promotion/relegation process in advance of the 2013–14 series. The Pre-Qualifier was folded into the Core Team Qualifier, which now involves 12 teams competing for a single promotion place as part of that season&#x27;s Hong Kong Sevens.

The total prize money stands at US$150,000. The Cup Champion wins US$100,000, and the runner-up takes home US$25,000; each semi-finalist loser receives US$12,500.

=== Pool ===
Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most tournaments in 15-a-side rugby union—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss. The first tiebreaker is the head-to-head result between the tied teams, followed by difference in points scored during the tournament.

=== Trophies round ===
Like all other World Series tournaments, four trophies are awarded at the end of a knockout tournament. Before the reorganisation of the tournament in 2013, the six pool winners, plus the two top-rated second-place teams, played for the Cup and Plate. The Cup is awarded to the overall tournament champion. As for the other World Series tournaments, four quarterfinal losers dropped into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl was contested by the four remaining second-place teams, plus the four top-rated third-place teams, while the Shield was contested by the eight remaining teams. The Shield was contested in Hong Kong for the first time in 2010.

Since the 2013 event, only the 16 teams in the main draw compete for trophies. The format is identical to that of other series events, with the top two teams in each pool advancing to the Cup and Plate tournaments, and the remaining teams contesting the Bowl and Shield. The losers of the Cup quarterfinals drop to the Plate tournament, and the losers of the Bowl quarterfinals drop to the Shield tournament.

== Atmosphere ==
The Hong Kong Rugby Sevens is traditionally one of the biggest events, if not the biggest, on the Hong Kong sporting calendar. As such, there is a tremendous party atmosphere, with the involvement of the entire rugby-playing community. A two-day women&#x27;s tournament, Hong Kong Women&#x27;s Rugby Sevens, precedes the men&#x27;s contests. Under the auspices of the Hong Kong Mini Rugby Football Union, children with local clubs aged between 6 and 12 years play tournaments before the main matches each day. They also take part in the March Past immediately before the semi-final round of the main tournament.

For spectators, particular emphasis is placed on the South Stand, where hordes of fans dress up and dance for most of the duration of Saturday. Activities that typically ensue as the weekend progresses include the throwing of empty beer jugs (banned circa 2006) around the South Stand, Mexican waves, and streakers running across the pitch (prosecutable). Outside the stadium, the &#x27;Sevens Village&#x27; at the Indian Recreation Club nearby is an alternative venue to gather and watch matches on giant screens, eat and drink to excess while matches are in progress; and after the match, partying continues with champagne and live music and DJs in the champagne tent. An annual public awareness campaign called &quot;Save Our Sevens&quot; sponsored by KELY Support Group, Hong Kong Rugby Union and supported by Start JG Hong Kong Limited encourages responsible drinking among spectators and interventions among underage drinkers while at the three-day event.

Since 2007 the South Stand has been made officially accessible to over-18s only, due to its hyper and somewhat provocative atmosphere. Streakers were formerly a regular feature, and still occasionally make a showing on the pitch, to the acclamation of the crowd. Nonetheless, most pitch invaders are caught and arrested. Following an incident in 2010 when one spectator climbed onto the crossbars at the south end of the stadium before dodging back into the stands and disappearing, organisers stepped up security and announced a zero-tolerance policy of invaders.

== Results by year ==

== All-time results ==

== Qualifier results ==
Since 2014, the Hong Kong Sevens has also featured a qualifying competition where the winner is promoted to &quot;core team&quot; status for the World Rugby Sevens Series the following season.

== Players ==
At each Hong Kong Sevens since 1980, the player who &quot;most exemplifies the spirit and skills needed in rugby sevens&quot; has received &#x27;The Leslie Williams Award for Best and Fairest Player&#x27;. It is named for the late Leslie Williams, who lived in Hong Kong from 1955 to 1971 and played for Hong Kong Football Club and the national team. The trophy has been awarded every year since 1980 with the exception of the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1997 and 2005 when there was a different individual award. Fijian legend Waisale Serevi is the only player to have won the Leslie Williams Trophy three times and he was also named Player of the Tournament at both RWC events.

=== Young talent ===
The Hong Kong Sevens has proven a fertile ground for nurturing young players who go on to star in the 15-man game.

For New Zealand, Jonah Lomu, Christian Cullen, Zinzan Brooke, John Schuster, Rodney So&#x27;oialo, Joe Rokocoko, Mils Muliaina and Rico Gear were first introduced to the international game of Sevens. For Australia, former captain George Gregan first demonstrated his ability at the Hong Kong Sevens in the same team as Joe Roff and Ben Tune. For Wales, Jamie Roberts and James Hook are among those who went on to the 15-man national team after playing in the Hong Kong Sevens. South Africa, also, have seen Jean de Villiers, Bryan Habana, Ricky Januarie, Brent Russell and Kabamba Floors showcase their variety of skills at the event.

<doc id="185432" wikidata="Q72337" url="?curid=185432" title="Morwell">
<text>Morwell is a town in the Latrobe Valley area of Gippsland, in South-Eastern Victoria, Australia approximately 152 km (94 mi) east of Melbourne.

Morwell has a population of 14,389 people at the .

It is both the capital and administrative centre for the City of Latrobe and the city’s second most populous town after the neighbouring Traralgon. Morwell is located in the centre of the Latrobe Valley urban area, which has a population of 77,168 at the 2021 Census and is home to many of the greater urban area&#x27;s civic institutions, administrative functions and infrastructure.

The city is known for its role as a major energy production centre for Victoria as the centre of a major coal mining and fossil-fuel power generation industry.

Morwell&#x27;s centenary rose garden located in the central business district, won an award in 2009 for being a &#x27;garden of excellence&#x27;. Since 2018, the town has hosted the International Rose Garden Festival Morwell (IRGFM).

==Naming==

The name of the town of Morwell is likely to be derived from a local Indigenous word from the Gunai language that means &quot;inhabitants of the swamp&quot;, referring to the Gunai clan that lived in the area. The nearby town of Moe was named after the Gunai word for &quot;swampland&quot;, which is a reference to the swamp between Moe and Yarragon that was drained in the 1890s.

From 1914, various newspaper editorials had stated that the name of Morwell comes from the Aboriginal words &quot;more willie&quot; meaning &quot;woolly possum&quot;. However, the Gunai word for possum is &quot;wadthan&quot; and the words &quot;wile&quot; or &quot;wollert&quot; come from Kulin words from the Woiwurrung language. The traditional lands of the Kulin nation intersect with the lands of the Gunai people to the west of Warragul, a town 50 km to the west of Morwell, which makes the naming unlikely to originate from a Kulin language. The town of Wollert, Victoria is named after this word for possum.

Morwell River was the first place to be recorded with the name Morwell, using the inconsistent spelling of &quot;Morewill River&quot; in the 1847 diary of Charles Tyers, &quot;Morewell River&quot; on an 1847 survey map
and &quot;River Morewelle&quot; in an 1848 notice of pastoral leases. Peter Jeremiah Smith established the Morewell Hotel on the river in 1858 and the name of the early settlement around the hotel was recorded as Morwell Bridge in a government survey in 1861. The name of Morwell was used for the new location of the town centre that surrounded the Morwell railway station after it opened in 1877.

In 1942, station-hand Llew Vary suggested that the name of Morwell is derived from the English town of Morwell on the Morwell River in Cornwall, but lacked any records of the naming. Members of the Morwell Rotary Club and Methodist Church developed the idea further in 1946 and historian Ivan Maddern strongly advocated for the idea from 1962. Methodist ministers communicated with their counterparts in England, who explained that there was a Morwellham on the River Tamar, a 100m-high cliff-face by the river known as Morwell Rocks, a Morwell Barton and a Morwell Priory.

Another theory is that &#x27;Morewell&#x27; is a corruption of &#x27;Mary Ville&#x27;, the original name of the Maryvale pastoral run established in 1845. The run was thought to be named after Mary, daughter of the Bennetts who established the Hazelwood station with Albert Brodribb to the south of Maryvale. However, the Morwell Historical Society wrote that the first recorded reference to &#x27;Morewell&#x27; was 1844.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants of the Morwell district were the Braiakaulung people, one of the five Indigenous Australian clans of the Gunai/Kurnai nation. The Braiakaulung people manufactured stone tools, as long as 5,000 years ago, from silcrete quarries in the Haunted Hills, west of Morwell and the Gunai/Kurnai had lived in the region for more than 20,000 years, according to evidence found at the New Guinea II cave near Buchan, Victoria.

The first Europeans to travel through the area include party of Count Paweł Strzelecki on their journey from the Snowy Mountains in April 1840, after Strzelecki had named Australia&#x27;s highest peak as Mount Kosciuszko. In 1838, Scottish pastoralist Angus McMillan rode horses up the Latrobe River near Sale, but not as far as Morwell, then made further journeys to Latrobe River after Strzelecki had visited the area. McMillan named the region as &#x27;Caledonia Australis&#x27; after his homeland, but the preferred name was &#x27;Gipps Land&#x27;, later becoming Gippsland, as chosen by Strzelecki in honour of New South Wales Governor George Gipps.

The first Europeans to take land in Morwell were called squatters and ran pastoral leases such as the 17,300 acre Hasellwood (later called Hazelwood) established by Albert Eugene Brodribb and William Bennett in October 1844, the 22,900 acre Mary Ville (later called Maryvale) established by Thomas Gorringe in February 1845, the 24,780 acre Merton Rush station established by Henry Scott in 1846 and the 5,730 acre Scrubby Forest established by Nicol Brown and William Hunter in 1848.

The 1870s were a time of railway building in Victoria. In 1873, the government approved the construction of a railway line from Melbourne to Sale and it was this decision which gave rise to the development of the township of Morwell. The railway station was approximately 3 miles (5 km) from the settlement by the river, leading to new development occurring around the railway station.

The first public sale of land in the town took place in January 1879 but there were at least ten traders operating in the town by that time, a Post Office in the township having been open since 1875 (an earlier PO having served the rural area from 1870 to 1873). On 1 January 1880 Morwell PO was renamed Morwell Bridge and Morwell Railway Station PO (open since 1877) became the main Morwell PO.

A major Research and Development project into the conversion of brown coal into oil, (Brown Coal Liquefaction Victoria or BCLV) was established in Morwell in 1983/84. Funded by the Japanese Government at a cost of over one billion dollars this project established a 50 tonne per day pilot plant which ran until 1991.

Thriving on the success of the power industry, Morwell developed into a city offering substantial housing and financial opportunities for its many residents. With the general growth of the Latrobe Valley, Morwell&#x27;s success appeared destined to continue. However, the approval by the City of Morwell to build the Mid Valley Shopping Centre complex away from the CBD led to the decline of the CBD, with many empty shopfronts the result. Further, restructuring and privatisation of the State Electricity Commission in the 1990s led to massive job losses in the region, which accelerated the decline of Morwell&#x27;s central business district. Many shops are now empty and in a state of disrepair. 

Amalgamation of the local councils following a Statewide review of local government boundaries in 1994 saw Morwell become part of the City of Latrobe and the civic centre established in Traralgon. With the re-establishment of an elected council, the civic centre was moved back to Morwell and the new council building constructed in 2005 in the hope of leading to a revitalisation of the city centre. Unfortunately, that revitalisation failed to eventuate. The new justice precinct was completed in 2006 and has somewhat increased CBD activity as alleged criminals come to the Morwell justice precinct for processing through the Justice System.

Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in March 2011 show the average wage of Morwell residents to be the lowest of the three major Latrobe Valley towns.

Morwell is the headquarters of the Central Gippsland Institute of Technical and Further Education. It contains a major regional art gallery with an excellent local collection and is noted for its extensive rose gardens. Nearby at Churchill is the Gippsland Campus of Federation University. A commemorative bust of Lt Gen Sir Stanley Savige was erected in 2006. Born in Morwell, Savige founded Legacy Australia following World War 1 to assist widows and families of servicemen.

Morwell is home to the Morwell Centenary Rose Garden, a parkland of over 2 hectares on a former railway reserve that showcases over 3500 roses. In 2009, the garden was presented an &#x27;Award of Garden Excellence&#x27; by the World Federation of Rose Societies. 

==Geography==

===Climate===
Morwell experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). Nights in Morwell are about 2 °C colder than in Melbourne.

== Governance ==
At local level, Morwell is governed by the City of Latrobe and is both the seat of local government and administrative centre. It is represented at local level by two councilors in the Central Ward (formerly by three wards – Rintoull in the city&#x27;s centre; Tanjil, the north and west; and Firmin, the south).

In the Government of Victoria it is represented in the Victorian Legislative Assembly by the Electoral district of Morwell. The state is responsible for law and order in Morwell. The Latrobe Valley Law Courts located opposite council headquarters in Commercial Road which has branches for the Supreme Court of Victoria, Magistrates&#x27; Court of Victoria and County Court of Victoria. It is served by a single Victoria Police police station on Hazelwood Road.

In the Government of Australia, it is represented in Parliament of Australia by the Division of Gippsland.

== Education ==
Morwell has education facilities from preschool education through to vocational education and training. University-level qualifications are available nearby at Federation University Australia, Gippsland campus which is located in the adjacent town of Churchill. Other education and training provider are located in the wider Latrobe Valley urban area. The city has 4 primary schools - Morwell Central Primary School, St Vincent De Paul Primary, Sacred Heart Primary and Morwell Park Primary and a single junior secondary school – Kurnai College Morwell Campus (est 1963). TAFE study in Morwell is available via TAFE Gippsland (initially GippsTAFE, then Federation Training later), as well as apprenticeships and traineeships through Apprenticeships Group Australia.

==Transport==

The Princes Freeway (A1) bypasses the town to the south while the old Princes Highway which once passed through east–west through its centre is now Princes Drive and Commercial Road. The highway connects Morwell with other Latrobe Valley cities including Moe to the west and Traralgon to the east.

<text>Dreadlocks, also known as dreads or locs, are a hairstyle made of rope-like strands of hair. Dreadlocks are created by either manually twisting the hair or by allowing it to mat naturally.

==Etymology==
The history of the name &quot;dreadlocks&quot; is unclear. Some authors trace the term to the Rastafarians, a group of whom apparently coined it in 1959 as a reference to their &quot;dread&quot;, or fear, of God.

In their 2014 book &quot;Hair Story: Untangling the Roots of Black Hair in America&quot;, Ayana Byrd and Lori Tharps claimed that the name &quot;dredlocs&quot; originated in the time of the slave trade: when transported Africans disembarked from the slave ships after spending months confined in unhygienic conditions, whites would report that their undressed and matted kinky hair was &quot;dreadful&quot;. According to them, it is due to these circumstances that many people wearing the style today drop the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;dreadlock&quot; to avoid negative implications. 

The word &quot;dreadlocks&quot; refers to matted locks of hair. Several different languages have names for these locks. In Sanskrit, the name is &quot;jaṭā&quot;; in Wolof, it is &quot;ndiagne&quot; and &quot;ndjan&quot;; in Akan, it is &quot;mpesempese&quot;. in Yoruba, it is &quot;dada&quot;; in Igbo, it is &quot;ezenwa&quot; and &quot;elena&quot;; in Hamer, it is &quot;goscha&quot;; in Shona, it is &quot;mhotsi&quot;; in Nyaneka, it is &quot;nontombi&quot;.

==History==

===Africa===
According to Sherrow in &quot;Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History&quot;, dreadlocks date back to ancient times in various cultures. In ancient Egypt, Egyptians wore locked hairstyles and wigs appeared on bas-reliefs, statuary and other artifacts. Mummified remains of Egyptians with locked wigs have also been recovered from archaeological sites. According to Maria Delongoria, braided hair was worn by people in the Sahara desert since 3000 BCE. Dreadlocks were also worn by followers of Abrahamic religions. For example, Ethiopian Coptic Bahatowie priests adopted dreadlocks as a hairstyle before the fifth century CE (400 or 500 CE). Locking hair was practiced by some ethnic groups in East, Central, West, and Southern Africa.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
Pre-Columbian Aztec priests were described in Aztec codices (including the Durán Codex, the Codex Tudela and the Codex Mendoza) as wearing their hair untouched, allowing it to grow long and matted. Bernal Diaz del Castillo records: There were priests with long robes of black cloth... The hair of these priests was very long and so matted that it could not be separated or disentangled, and most of them had their ears scarified, and their hair was clotted with blood.
===Hairstyles in Europe ===

The earliest known possible depictions of dreadlocks date back as far as 1600–1500 BCE in the Minoan Civilization, centered in Crete (now part of Greece). Frescoes discovered on the Aegean island of Thera (modern Santorini, Greece) portray individuals with long braided hair or long dreadlocks. Another source describes the hair of the boys in the Akrotiri Boxer Fresco as long tresses, not dreadlocks. Tresses of hair are defined by Collins Dictionary as braided hair, braided plaits, or long loose curls of hair.
===Nineteenth century===

In what is now Poland, for about a thousand years, some people wore a matted hairstyle similar to that of some Iranic Scythians. Zygmunt Gloger in his &quot;Encyklopedia staropolska&quot; mentions that the Polish plait (&quot;plica polonica&quot;) hairstyle was worn by some people in the Pinsk region and the Masovia region at the beginning of the 19th century. The Polish plait can vary between one large plait and multiple plaits that resemble dreadlocks. Polish plaits according to historical records were often infested with lice. It was believed that not washing and combing the hair would protect a person from diseases. This folk belief was sometimes common in Eastern Europe.

In Senegal, the Baye Fall, followers of the Mouride movement, a Sufi movement of Islam founded in 1887 CE by Shaykh Aamadu Bàmba Mbàkke, are famous for growing dreadlocks and wearing multi-colored gowns.

Cheikh Ibra Fall, founder of the Baye Fall school of the Mouride Brotherhood, popularized the style by adding a mystic touch to it. This sect of Islam in Senegal, where Muslims wear &quot;ndjan&quot; (dreadlocks), aimed to Africanize Islam. Dreadlocks to this group of Islamic followers symbolize their religious orientation. Jamaican Rastas also reside in Senegal and have settled in areas near Baye Fall communities. Baye Fall and Jamaican Rastas have similar cultural beliefs regarding dreadlocks. Both groups wear knitted caps to cover their locs and wear locs for religious and spiritual purposes. Male members of the Baye Fall religion wear locs to detach from mainstream Western ideals.

===Twentieth century into present day===
In the 1970s, Americans and Britons attended reggae concerts and were exposed to various aspects of Jamaican culture, including dreadlocks. Hippies related to the Rastafarian idea of rejecting capitalism and colonialism, symbolized by the name &quot;Babylon&quot;. Rastafarians rejected Babylon in multiple ways, including by wearing their hair naturally in locs to defy Western standards of beauty. The 1960s was the height of the civil rights movement in the U.S., and some White Americans joined Black people in the fight against inequality and segregation and were inspired by Black culture. As a result, some White people joined the Rastafarian movement. Dreadlocks were not a common hairstyle in the United States, but by the 1970s, some White Americans were inspired by reggae music, the Rastafarian movement, and African-American hair culture and started wearing dreadlocks. According to authors Bronner and Dell Clark, the clothing styles worn by hippies in the 1960s and 1970s were copied from African-American culture. The word hippie comes from the African-American slang word &quot;hip&quot;. African-American dress and hairstyles such as braids (often decorated with beads), dreadlocks, and language were copied by hippies and developed into a new countercultural movement used by hippies.

In Europe in the 1970s, hundreds of Jamaicans and other Caribbean people immigrated to metropolitan centers of London, Birmingham, Paris, and Amsterdam. Communities of Jamaicans, Caribbeans, and Rastas emerged in these areas. Thus Europeans in these metropolitan cities were introduced to Black cultures from the Caribbean and Rastafarian practices and were inspired by Caribbean culture, leading some of them to adopt Black hair culture, music, and religion. However, the strongest influence of Rastafari religion is among Europe&#x27;s Black population.

When reggae music, which espoused Rastafarian ideals, gained popularity and mainstream acceptance in the 1970s, thanks to Bob Marley&#x27;s music and cultural influence, dreadlocks (often called &quot;dreads&quot;) became a notable fashion statement worldwide, and have been worn by prominent authors, actors, athletes, and rappers. Rastafari influenced its members worldwide to embrace dreadlocks. Black Rastas loc their hair to embrace their African heritage and accept African features as beautiful, such as dark skin tones, Afro-textured hair, and African facial features.

Hip Hop and rap artists such as Lauryn Hill, Lil Wayne, T-Pain, Snoop Dog, J-Cole, Wiz Khalifa, Chief Keef, Lil Jon, and other artists wear dreadlocks, which further popularized the hairstyle in the 1990s, early 2000s, and present day. Dreadlocks are a part of hip-hop fashion and reflect Black cultural music of liberation and identity. Many rappers and Afrobeat artists in Uganda wear locs, such as Navio, Delivad Julio, Fik Fameica, Vyper Ranking, Byaxy, Liam Voice, and other artists. From reggae music to hip hop, rap, and Afrobeat, Black artists in the African diaspora wear locs to display their Black identity and culture.

Youth in Kenya who are fans of rap and hip hop music, and Kenyan rappers and musicians, wear locs to connect to the history of the Mau Mau freedom fighters who wore locs as symbols of anti-colonialism, and to Bob Marley, who was a Rasta. Hip hop and reggae fashion spread to Ghana and fused with traditional Ghanaian culture. Ghanaian musicians wear dreadlocks incorporating reggae symbols and hip hop clothes mixed with traditional Ghanaian textiles, such as wearing Ghanaian headwraps to hold their locs. Ghanaian women wear locs as a symbol of African beauty. The beauty industry in Ghana believe locs are a traditional African hair practice and market hair care products to promote natural African hairstyles such as afros and locs. The previous generations of Black artists have inspired younger contemporary Black actresses to loc their hair, such as Chloe Bailey, Halle Bailey, and R&amp;B and Pop music singer Willow Smith. More Black actors in Hollywood are choosing to loc their hair to embrace their Black heritage.

Although more Black women in Hollywood and the beauty and music industries are wearing locs, there has never been a Black Miss America winner with locs because there is pushback in the fashion industry towards Black women&#x27;s natural hair. For example, model Adesuwa Aighewi locked her hair and was told she might not receive any casting calls because of her dreadlocks. Some Black women in modeling agencies are forced to straighten their hair. However, more Black women are resisting and choosing to wear Black hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks in fashion shows and beauty pageants. For example, in 2007 Miss Universe Jamaica and Rastafarian, Zahra Redwood, was the first Black woman to break the barrier on a world pageant stage when she wore locs, paving the way and influencing other Black women to wear locs in beauty pageants. In 2015, Miss Jamaica World Sanneta Myrie was the first contestant to wear locs to the Miss World Pageant. In 2018, Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers of Britain was crowned Miss Universe wearing her locs and became the first Black British woman to win the competition with natural locs.

Hollywood cinema often uses the dreadlock hairstyle as a prop in movies for villains and pirates. According to author Steinhoff, this appropriates dreadlocks and removes them from their original meaning of Black heritage to one of dread and otherness. In the movie &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;, the pirate Jack Sparrow wears dreadlocks. Dreadlocks are used in Hollywood to mystify a character and make them appear threatening or living a life of danger. In the movie &quot;The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;, pirates were dressed in dreadlocks to signify their cursed lives.

== By culture ==

Locks have been worn for various reasons in many cultures and ethnic groups around the world throughout history. Their use has also been raised in debates about cultural appropriation.

=== Africa ===
The practice of wearing braids and dreadlocks in Africa dates back to 3,000 BC in the Sahara Desert. It has been commonly thought that other cultures influenced the dreadlock tradition in Africa. The Kikuyu and Somali wear braided and locked hairstyles. Warriors among the Fulani, Wolof, and Serer in Mauritania, and Mandinka in Mali were known for centuries to have worn cornrows when young and dreadlocks when old.

In West Africa, the water spirit Mami Wata is said to have long locked hair. Mami Wata&#x27;s spiritual powers of fertility and healing come from her dreadlocks. West African spiritual priests called &quot;Dada&quot; wear dreadlocks to venerate Mami Wata in her honor as spiritual consecrations. Some Ethiopian Christian monks and Bahatowie priests of the Ethiopian Coptic Church lock their hair for religious purposes. In Yorubaland, Aladura church prophets called &quot;woolii&quot; mat their hair into locs and wear long blue, red, white, or purple garments with caps and carry iron rods used as a staff. Prophets lock their hair in accordance with the Nazarene vow in the Christian bible. This is not to be confused with the Rastafari religion that was started in the 1930s. The Aladura church was founded in 1925 and syncretizes indigenous Yoruba beliefs about dreadlocks with Christianity. Moses Orimolade Tunolase was the founder of the first African Pentecostal movement started in 1925 in Nigeria. Tunolase wore dreadlocks and members of his church wear dreadlocks in his honor and for spiritual protection.

The Yoruba word &quot;Dada&quot; is given to children in Nigeria born with dreadlocks. Some Yoruba people believe children born with dreadlocks have innate spiritual powers, and cutting their hair might cause serious illness. Only the child&#x27;s mother can touch their hair. &quot;Dada children are believed to be young gods, they are often offered at spiritual altars for chief priests to decide their fate. Some children end up becoming spiritual healers and serve at the shrine for the rest of their lives.&quot; If their hair is cut, it must be cut by a chief priest and placed in a pot of water with herbs, and the mixture is used to heal the child if they get sick. Among the Igbo, Dada children are said to be reincarnated Jujuists of great spiritual power because of their dreadlocks. Children born with dreadlocks are viewed as special. However, adults with dreadlocks are viewed negatively. Yoruba Dada children&#x27;s dreadlocks are shaved at a river, and their hair is grown back &quot;tamed&quot; and have a hairstyle that conforms to societal standards. The child continues to be recognized as mysterious and special. It is believed that the hair of Dada children was braided in heaven before they were born and will bring good fortune and wealth to their parents. When the child is older, the hair is cut during a special ritual. In Yoruba mythology, the Orisha Yemoja gave birth to a Dada who is a deified king in Yoruba. However, dreadlocks are viewed in a negative light in Nigeria due to their stereotypical association with gangs and criminal activity; men with dreadlocks face profiling from Nigerian police.

In Ghana, among the Ashanti people, Okomfo priests are identified by their dreadlocks. They are not allowed to cut their hair and must allow it to mat and lock naturally. Locs are symbols of higher power reserved for priests. Other spiritual people in Southern Africa who wear dreadlocks are Sangomas. Sangomas wear red and white beaded dreadlocks to connect to ancestral spirits. Two African men were interviewed, explaining why they chose to wear dreadlocks. &quot;One – Mr. Ngqula – said he wore his dreadlocks to obey his ancestors&#x27; call, given through dreams, to become a &#x27;sangoma&#x27; in accordance with his Xhosa culture. Another – Mr. Kamlana – said he was instructed to wear his dreadlocks by his ancestors and did so to overcome &#x27;intwasa&#x27;, a condition understood in African culture as an injunction from the ancestors to become a traditional healer, from which he had suffered since childhood.&quot; In Zimbabwe, there is a tradition of locking hair called &quot;mhotsi&quot; worn by spirit mediums called &quot;svikiro&quot;. The Rastafarian religion spread to Zimbabwe and influenced some women in Harare to wear locs because they believe in the Rastafari&#x27;s pro-Black teachings and rejection of colonialism.
Maasai warriors in Kenya are known for their long, thin, red dreadlocks, dyed with red root extracts or red ochre (red earth clay). The Himba women in Namibia are also known for their red-colored dreadlocks. Himba women use red earth clay mixed with butterfat and roll their hair with the mixture. They use natural moisturizers to maintain the health of their hair. Hamar women in Ethiopia wear red-colored locs made using red earth clay. In Angola, Mwila women create thick dreadlocks covered in herbs, crushed tree bark, dried cow dung, butter, and oil. The thick dreadlocks are dyed using oncula, an ochre of red crushed rock. In Southern, Eastern, and Northern Africa, Africans use red ochre as sunscreen and cover their dreadlocks and braids with ochre to hold their hair in styles and as a hair moisturizer by mixing it with fats. Red ochre has a spiritual meaning of fertility, and in Maasai culture, the color red symbolizes bravery and is used in ceremonies and dreadlock hair traditions.

Historians note that West and Central African people braid their hair to signify age, gender, rank, role in society, and ethnic affiliation. It is believed braided and locked hair provides spiritual protection, connects people to the spirit of the earth, bestows spiritual power, and enables people to communicate with the gods and spirits. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the Atlantic slave trade saw Black Africans forcibly transported from Sub-Saharan Africa to North America and, upon their arrival in the New World, their heads would be shaved in an effort to erase their culture. Enslaved Africans spent months in slave ships and their hair matted into dreadlocks that European slave traders called &quot;dreadful.&quot;

===African diaspora===

In the African diaspora, people loc their hair to have a connection to the spirit world and receive messages from spirits. It is believed locs of hair are antennas making the wearer receptive to spiritual messages. Other reasons people loc their hair are for fashion and to maintain the health of natural hair, also called kinky hair. In the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, the Black Power movement, Black is Beautiful movement, and the natural hair movement inspired many Black Americans to wear their hair natural in afros, braids, and locked hairstyles. The Black is Beautiful cultural movement spread to Black communities in Britain. In the 1960s and 1970s, Black people in Britain were aware of the civil rights movement and other cultural movements in Black America and the social and political changes occurring at the time. The Black is Beautiful movement and Rastafari culture in Europe influenced Afro-Britons to wear their hair in natural loc styles and afros as a way to fight against racism, Western standards of beauty, and to develop unity among Black people of diverse backgrounds. From the twentieth century to the present day, dreadlocks have been symbols of Black liberation and are worn by revolutionaries, activists, womanists, and radical artists in the diaspora. For example, Black American literary author Toni Morrison wore locs, and Alice Walker wears locs to reconnect with their African heritage.

Natural Black hairstyles worn by Black women are seen as not feminine and unprofessional in some American businesses. Wearing locs in the diaspora signifies a person&#x27;s racial identity and defiance of European standards of beauty, such as straight blond hair. Locs encourage Black people to embrace other aspects of their culture that are tied to Black hair, such as wearing African ornaments like cowrie shells, beads, and African headwraps that are sometimes worn with locs. Some Black Canadian women wear locs to connect to the global Black culture. Dreadlocks unite Black people in the diaspora because wearing locs has the same meaning in areas of the world where there are Black people: opposing Eurocentric standards of beauty and sharing a Black and African diaspora identity. For many Black women in the diaspora, locs are a fashion statement to express individuality and the beauty and versatility of Black hair. Locs are also a protective hairstyle to maintain the health of their hair by wearing kinky hair in natural locs or faux locs. To protect their natural hair from the elements during the changing seasons, Black women wear certain hairstyles to protect and retain the moisture in their hair. Black women wear soft locs as a protective hairstyle because they enclose natural hair inside them, protecting their natural hair from environmental damage. This protective soft loc style is created by &quot;wrapping hair around the natural hair or crocheting pre-made soft locs into cornrows.&quot; In the diaspora, Black men and women wear different styles of dreadlocks. Each style requires a different method of care. Freeform locs are formed organically by not combing the hair or manipulating the hair. There are also goddess locs, faux locs, sister locs, twisted locs, Rasta locs, crinkle locs, invisible locs, and other loc styles.

=== Australia ===

Some Indigenous Australians of North West and North Central Australia, as well as the Gold Coast region of Eastern Australia, have historically worn their hair in a locked style, sometimes also having long beards that are fully or partially locked. Traditionally, some wear the dreadlocks loose, while others wrap the dreadlocks around their heads or bind them at the back of the head. In North Central Australia, the tradition is for the dreadlocks to be greased with fat and coated with red ochre, which assists in their formation. In 1931 in Warburton Range, Western Australia, a photograph was taken of an Aboriginal Australian man with dreadlocks.

In the 1970s, hippies from Australia&#x27;s southern region moved to Kuranda, where they introduced the Rastafari movement as expressed in the reggae music of Peter Tosh and Bob Marley to the Buluwai people in the 1970s. Aboriginal Australians found parallels between the struggles of Black people in the Americas and their own racial struggles in Australia. Willie Brim, a Buluwai man born in the 1960s in Kuranda, identified with Tosh&#x27;s and Marley&#x27;s spiritually conscious music, and inspired particularly by Peter Tosh&#x27;s album &quot;Bush Doctor&quot;, in 1978 he founded a reggae band called &quot;Mantaka&quot; after the area alongside the Barron River where he grew up. He combined his people&#x27;s cultural traditions with the reggae guitar he had played since he was young, and his band&#x27;s music reflects Buluwai culture and history. Now a leader of the Buluwai people and a cultural steward, Brim and his band send an &quot;Aboriginal message&quot; to the world. He and other Buluwai people wear dreadlocks as a native part of their culture and not as an influence from the Rastafari religion. Although Brim was inspired by reggae music, he is not a Rastafarian as he and his people have their own spirituality. Foreigners visiting Australia think the Buluwai people wearing dreadlocks were influenced by the Rastafarian movement, but the Buluwai say their ancestors wore dreadlocks before the movement began. Some Indigenous Australians wear an Australian Aboriginal flag (a symbol of unity and Indigenous identity in Australia) tied around their head to hold their dreadlocks.

=== Buddhism/Hinduism ===
Within Tibetan Buddhism and other more esoteric forms of Buddhism, locks have occasionally been substituted for the more traditional shaved head. The most recognizable of these groups are known as the Ngagpas of Tibet. For Buddhists of these particular sects and degrees of initiation, their locked hair is not only a symbol of their vows but an embodiment of the particular powers they are sworn to carry. Hevajra Tantra 1.4.15 states that the practitioner of particular ceremonies &quot;should arrange his piled up hair&quot; as part of the ceremonial protocol. Archeologists found a statue of a male deity, Shiva, with dreadlocks in Stung Treng province in Cambodia. In a sect of tantric Buddhism, some initiates wear dreadlocks. The sect of tantric Buddhism in which initiates wear dreadlocks is called &quot;weikza&quot; and &quot;Passayana&quot; or Vajrayana Buddhism. This sect of Buddhism is practiced in Burma. The initiates spend years in the forest with this practice, and when they return to the temples, they should not shave their heads to reintegrate.

=== Hinduism ===
The practice of wearing a &quot;jaṭā&quot; (dreadlocks) is observed in modern-day Hinduism, most notably by sadhus who worship Shiva. The Kapalikas, first commonly referenced in the 6th century CE, were known to wear the &quot;jaṭā&quot; as a form of deity imitation of the deva Bhairava-Shiva. Shiva is often depicted with dreadlocks. According to Ralph Trueb, &quot;Shiva&#x27;s dreadlocks represent the potent power of his mind that enables him to catch and bind the unruly and wild river goddess Ganga.&quot;

In a village in Pune, Savitha Uttam Thorat, some women hesitate to cut their long dreadlocks because it is believed it will cause misfortune or bring down divine wrath. Dreadlocks practiced by the women in this region of India are believed to be possessed by the goddess Yellamma. Cutting off the hair is believed to bring misfortune onto the woman, because having dreadlocks is considered to be a gift from the goddess Yellamma (also known as Renuka). Some of the women have long and heavy dreadlocks that put a lot of weight on their necks, causing pain and limited mobility. Some in local government and police in the Maharashtra region demand the women cut their hair, because the religious practice of Yellamma forbids women from washing and cutting their dreadlocks, causing health issues. These locks of hair dedicated to Yellamma are called &quot;jade&quot;, believed to be evidence of divine presence. However, in Southern India, people advocate for the end of the practice.
The goddess Angala Parameshvari in Indian mythology is said to have &quot;cataik-kari&quot; matted hair (dreadlocks). Women healers in India are identified by their locs of hair and are respected in spiritual rituals because they are believed to be connected to goddesses. A woman who has a &quot;jata&quot; is believed to derive her spiritual powers or &quot;shakti&quot; from her dreadlocks.

=== Rastafari ===

Rastafari movement dreadlocks are symbolic of the Lion of Judah, and were inspired by the Nazarites of the Bible. Jamaicans locked their hair after seeing images of Ethiopians with locs fighting Italian soldiers during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War. The afro is the preferred hairstyle worn by Ethiopians. During the Italian invasion, Ethiopians vowed not to cut their hair using the Biblical example of Samson, who got his strength from his seven locks of hair, until emperor Ras Tafari Makonnen (Haile Selassie) and Ethiopia were liberated and Selassie was returned from exile. Scholars also state another indirect Ethiopian influence for Rastas locking their hair are the Bahatowie priests in Ethiopia and their tradition of wearing dreadlocks for religious reasons since the 5th century AD. Another African influence for Rastas wearing locs was seeing photos of Mau Mau freedom fighters with locs in Kenya fighting against the British authorities in the 1950s. Dreadlocks to the Mau Mau freedom fighters were a symbol of anti-colonialism, and this symbolism of dreadlocks was an inspiration for Rastas to loc their hair in opposition to racism and promote an African identity. The branch of Rastafari that was inspired to loc their hair after the Mau Mau freedom fighters was the &quot;Nyabinghi Order&quot;, previously called &quot;Young Black Faith&quot;. Young Black Faith were considered a radical group of younger Rastafari members. Eventually, other Rastafari groups started locking their hair.

In the Rastafarian belief, people wear locs for a spiritual connection to the universe and the spirit of the earth. It is believed that by shaking their locs, they will bring down the destruction of Babylon. Babylon in the Rastafarian belief is systemic racism, colonialism, and any system of economic and social oppression of Black people. Locs are also worn to defy European standards of beauty and help to develop a sense of Black pride and acceptance of African features as beautiful. In another branch of Rastafari called &quot;Boboshanti Order of Rastafari&quot;, dreadlocks are worn to display a black person&#x27;s identity and social protest against racism. The Bobo Ashanti are one of the strictest Mansions of Rastafari. They cover their locs with bright turbans and wear long robes and can usually be distinguished from other Rastafari members because of this. Other Rastas wear a Rastacap to tuck their locs under the cap.

The &quot;Bobo Ashanti&quot; (&quot;Bobo&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; in Iyaric; and &quot;Ashanti&quot; in reference to the Ashanti people of Ghana, whom the Bobos claim are their ancestors), were founded by Emmanuel Charles Edwards in 1959 during the period known as the &quot;groundation&quot;, where many protests took place calling for the repatriation of African descendants and slaves to Kingston. A Boboshanti branch spread to Ghana because of repatriated Jamaicans and other Black Rastas moving to Ghana. Prior to Rastas living in Ghana, Ghanaians and West Africans previously had their own beliefs about locked hair. Dreadlocks in West Africa are believed to bestow children born with locked hair with spiritual power, and that &quot;Dada&quot; children, that is, those born with dreadlocks, were given to their parents by water deities. Rastas and Ghanaians have similar beliefs about the spiritual significance of dreadlocks, such as not touching a person&#x27;s or child&#x27;s locs, maintaining clean locs, locs spiritual connections to spirits, and locs bestowing spiritual powers to the wearer.

=== In sports ===

Dreadlocks have become a popular hairstyle among professional athletes. However, some athletes are discriminated against and were forced to cut their dreadlocks. For example, in December 2018, a Black high school wrestler in New Jersey was forced to cut his dreadlocks 90 seconds before his match, sparking a civil rights case that led to the passage of the CROWN Act in 2019.

In professional American football, the number of players with dreadlocks has increased since Al Harris and Ricky Williams first wore the style during the 1990s. In 2012, about 180 National Football League players wore dreadlocks. A significant number of these players are defensive backs, who are less likely to be tackled than offensive players. According to the NFL&#x27;s rulebook, a player&#x27;s hair is considered part of their &quot;uniform&quot;, meaning the locks are fair game when attempting to bring them down.

In the NBA, there has been controversy over Brooklyn Nets guard Jeremy Lin, an Asian-American who garnered mild controversy over his choice of dreadlocks. Former NBA player Kenyon Martin accused Lin of appropriating African-American culture in a since-deleted social media post, after which Lin pointed out that Martin has multiple Chinese characters tattooed on his body.

David Diamante, the American Boxing ring announcer of Italian American heritage, sports prominent dreadlocks.

== Hair discrimination ==

On 3 July 2019, California became the first US state to prohibit discrimination over natural hair. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the CROWN Act into law, banning employers and schools from discriminating against hairstyles such as dreadlocks, braids, afros, and twists. Likewise, later in 2019, Assembly Bill 07797 became law in New York state; it &quot;prohibits race discrimination based on natural hair or hairstyles&quot;. Scholars call discrimination based on hair &quot;hairism&quot;. Despite the passage of the CROWN Act, hairism continues, with some Black people being fired from work or not hired because of their dreadlocks. According to the CROWN 2023 Workplace Research Study, sixty-six percent of Black women change their hairstyle for job interviews, and twenty-five percent of Black women said they were denied a job because of their hairstyle. The CROWN Act was passed to challenge the idea that Black people must emulate other hairstyles to be accepted in public and educational spaces. As of 2023, 24 states have passed the CROWN Act. July 3 is recognized as National CROWN Day, also called Black Hair Independence Day.

The Perception Institute conducted a &quot;Good Hair Study&quot; using images of Black women wearing natural styles in locs, afros, twists, and other Black hairstyles. The Perception Institute is &quot;a consortium of researchers, advocates and strategists&quot; that uses psychological and emotional test studies to make participants aware of their racial biases. A Black-owned hair supply company, Shea Moisture, partnered with Perception Institute to conduct the study. The tests were done to reduce hair- and racially-based discrimination in education, civil justice, and law enforcement places. The study used an implicit-association test on 4,000 participants of all racial backgrounds and showed most of the participants had negative views about natural Black hairstyles. The study also showed Millennials were the most accepting of kinky hair texture on Black people. &quot;Noliwe Rooks, a Cornell University professor who writes about the intersection of beauty and race, says for some reason, natural Black hair just frightens some White people.&quot;

In September of 2016, a lawsuit was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against the company Catastrophe Management Solutions located in Mobile, Alabama. The court case ended with the decision that it was not a discriminatory practice for the company to refuse to hire an African American because they wore dreadlocks.

In some Texas public schools, dreadlocks are prohibited, especially for male students, because long braided hair is considered unmasculine according to Western standards of masculinity which define masculinity as &quot;short, tidy hair.&quot; Black and Native American boys are stereotyped and receive negative treatment and negative labeling for wearing dreadlocks, cornrows, and long braids. Non-white students are prohibited from practicing their traditional hairstyles that are a part of their culture.

The policing of Black hairstyles also occurs in London, England. Black students in England are prohibited from wearing natural hairstyles such as dreadlocks, afros, braids, twists, and other African and Black hairstyles. Black students are suspended from school, are stereotyped, and receive negative treatment from teachers.

In Midrand, north of Joburg in South Africa, a Black girl was kicked out of school for wearing her hair in a natural dreadlock style . Hair and dreadlock discrimination is experienced by people of color all over the world who do not conform to Western standards of beauty. At Pretoria High School for Girls in Gauteng province in South Africa, Black girls are discriminated against for wearing African hairstyles and are forced to straighten their hair.

In 2017, the United States Army lifted the ban on dreadlocks. In the army, Black women can now wear braids and locs under the condition that they are groomed, clean, and meet the length requirements. From slavery into the present day, the policing of Black women&#x27;s hair continues to be controlled by some institutions and people. Even when Black women wear locs and they are clean and well-kept, some people do not consider locs to be feminine and professional because of the natural kinky texture of Black hair.

Four African countries approved the wearing of dreadlocks in their courts: Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. However, hairism continues despite the approval. Although locked hairstyles are a traditional practice on the African continent, some Africans disapprove of the hairstyle because of cultural taboos or pressure from Europeans in African schools and local African governments to conform to Eurocentric standards of beauty.

===Police profiling===

Black men who wear locs are racially profiled and watched more by the police and are believed to be &quot;thugs&quot; or involved in gangs and violent crimes than Black men who do not wear dreadlocks.

== &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; ==
On 10 December 2010, the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; rested its &quot;longest dreadlocks&quot; category after investigating its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, with this official statement:

Following a review of our guidelines for the longest dreadlock, we have taken expert advice and made the decision to rest this category. The reason for this is that it is difficult, and in many cases impossible, to measure the authenticity of the locks due to expert methods employed in the attachment of hair extensions/re-attachment of broken-off dreadlocks. Effectively the dreadlock can become an extension and therefore impossible to adjudicate accurately. It is for this reason Guinness World Records has decided to rest the category and will no longer be monitoring the category for longest dreadlock.

<text>Veneration (; ), or veneration of saints, is the act of honoring a saint, a person who has been identified as having a high degree of sanctity or holiness. Angels are shown similar veneration in many religions. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism and Jainism.

Within Christianity, veneration is practiced by groups such as the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Oriental Orthodox Church, all of which have varying types of canonization or glorification processes. In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, veneration is shown outwardly by respectfully kissing, bowing or making the sign of the cross before a saint&#x27;s icon, relics, or statue, or by going on pilgrimage to sites associated with saints. In general, veneration is not practiced by Protestants and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, as many adherents of both groups believe the practice amounts to idolatry. Common Lutherans and Anglicans have a positive attitude toward the veneration of saints and practice the naming of churches after saints, as well as keeping certain feasts.

Hinduism has a long tradition of veneration of saints, expressed toward various gurus and teachers of sanctity, both living and dead. Branches of Buddhism include formal liturgical worship of saints, with Mahayana Buddhism classifying degrees of sainthood.

In Islam, veneration of saints is practiced by some of the adherents of traditional Islam (Sufis, for example), and in many parts of places like Turkey, Egypt, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Other sects, such as Wahhabists etc., abhor the practice.

In Judaism, there is no classical or formal recognition of saints, but there is a long history of reverence shown toward biblical heroes and martyrs. Jews in some regions, for example in Morocco, have a long and widespread tradition of saint veneration.

==Buddhism==
In major Buddhist traditions, Theravada and Mahayana, those who have achieved a high degree of enlightenment are recognized as arhats. Mahayana Buddhism particularly gives emphasis to the power of saints to aid ordinary people on the path to enlightenment. Those who have reached enlightenment, and have delayed their own complete enlightenment in order to help others, are called Bodhisattvas. Mahayana Buddhism has formal liturgical practices for venerating saints, along with very specific levels of sainthood. Tibetan Buddhists venerate especially holy lamas, such as the Dalai Lama, as saints.

==Christianity==
Veneration towards those who were considered holy began in early Christianity, with the martyrs first being given special honor. Official commemoration of saints in churches began as early as the first century. The apostle Paul mentioned saints by name in his writings. Icons depicting saints were created in the catacombs. The Orthodox Church of Byzantium began official church commemoration very early and even in Rome, commemoration is documented in the third century. Over time, the honor also began to be given to those Christians who lived lives of holiness and sanctity. Various denominations venerate and determine saints in different ways, with some having a formal canonization or glorification process. It is also the first step to becoming a saint.

===Latria, hyperdulia, protodulia and dulia===
Christian theologians have long adopted the terms &quot;latria&quot; for the type of worship due to God alone, and &quot;dulia&quot; and &quot;proskynesis&quot; for the veneration given to angels, saints, relics and icons.

Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologies also include the terms &quot;hyperdulia&quot; and &quot;protodulia&quot; for the types of veneration, the former specifically paid to the Virgin Mary, while the latter to Saints Joseph and John the Baptist. The Roman Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas specifies that &quot;hyperdulia&quot; is the same type of veneration as &quot;dulia&quot;, only given in a greater degree; both remain distinct from &quot;latria&quot;.

===Catholicism===

In Catholicism, veneration is a type of honor distinct from the true worship (veritable adoration), which is due to God alone. According to Mark Miravelle, of the Franciscan University of Steubenville, the English word &quot;worship&quot; has been associated with both veneration and adoration:

As Thomas Aquinas explained, adoration, which is known as latria in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the creator that God alone deserves. 

Veneration, known as dulia in classical theology, is the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. 

Historically, schools of theology have used the term &quot;worship&quot; as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between &quot;worship of adoration&quot; and &quot;worship of veneration&quot;. The word &quot;worship&quot; (in a similar way to how the liturgical term &quot;cult&quot; is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term &quot;worship&quot; not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.
According to the &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;:

In the Roman Catechism, a more lengthy statement on The Honour and Invocation of the Saints is available.

Catholic tradition has a well established philosophy for the veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church via the field of Mariology with Pontifical schools such as the Marianum specifically devoted to this task.

For the doctrine of the Catholic Church, in addition to the dogma of her Divine Motherhood, the Mother of God &quot;Theotokos&quot; was the subject of three other dogmas:
# Immaculate Conception (absence of the original sin, by grace of God) 
# Perpetual virginity (before, during, and after the birth of Jesus, until her Assumption) 
# Assumption (in body and soul to Heaven).

Protodulia is the special veneration given to Saint Joseph, the foster father of Jesus, within Josephology. This veneration of Saint Joseph is distinct from hyperdulia, which is reserved for Mary, and latria, the worship due to the God alone.

While Saint Joseph is venerated for his role in the Holy Family, the title of protodulia signifies that among the saints, he holds a unique and preeminent place, second only to Mary. The Church regards him as a powerful intercessor and protector of the Church, and his virtues—obedience, humility, and care for Jesus and Mary—are celebrated.

The theological grounding for protodulia is rooted in several papal documents and the long-standing tradition of the Church:

# Pope Pius IX proclaimed Saint Joseph the Patron of the Universal Church in 1870.
# Pope Leo XIII emphasized special role of Saint Joseph in the Church in his encyclical &quot;Quamquam pluries&quot; (1889), where he called for greater devotion to him.
# Pope Pius XII further affirmed this devotion by instituting the feast of Saint Joseph the Worker in 1955.

In the Catholic Church, there are many different forms of veneration of saints, such as a pilgrimages (e.g. those of Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb (Vatican), Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua (Italy), Santiago de Compostela Cathedral (Spain), or Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Israel)). It is also usual to make a pilgrimage to places associated with the life of a saint, such as the Cave of Santo Hermano Pedro (Spain), the Cave of the Apocalypse (Greece) or the Aya Tekla Church (Turkey). Veneration of images and relics; Lord of Miracles (Peru), the Virgin of Guadalupe and Saint Jude Thaddaeu (Mexico), Holy Dexter (Hungary), Reliquary of the Three Kings (Germany), etc.

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
In the Syriac Orthodox Church liturgical service, the Hail Mary is pronounced as a prefatory prayer after the Our Father, and before the priest&#x27;s entrance to the chancel. The name of the Blessed Virgin Mary has also been probably used for the sanctification of altars, above the name of all other saints.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, veneration of the saints is an important element of worship. Most services are closed with the words “Most Holy Theotokos, save us!&quot; and would use troparions and kontakions to venerate the saint of the day. This practice of venerating saints both through praise and by means of their icons is defended in John Damascene&#x27;s book &quot;On Holy Images&quot;, and was the subject of the Second Council of Nicaea.

===Protestantism===

In Protestant churches, veneration is sometimes considered to amount to the sin of idolatry, and the related practice of canonization amounts to the heresy of apotheosis. Protestant theology usually denies that any real distinction between veneration and worship can be made, and claims that the practice of veneration distracts the Christian soul from its true object, the worship of God. In his &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;, John Calvin writes that &quot;(t)he distinction of what is called &quot;dulia&quot; and &quot;latria&quot; was invented for the very purpose of permitting divine honours to be paid to angels and dead men with apparent impunity&quot;. 

Anglicanism and Lutheranism allow the veneration of saints in a manner similar to Catholicism.

===Bible===
In terms of venerating relics of saints, two verses are frequently mentioned:

&#x27;Once while some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a band of raiders; so they threw the man’s body into Elisha’s tomb. When the body touched Elisha’s bones, the man came to life and stood up on his feet.&#x27; (2 Kings 13:21, NIV).

&#x27;God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them.&#x27; (Acts 19:11, 12, NIV). 
The deuterocanonical Book of Sirach also briefly discusses venerating the memory of patriarchs and prophets: &quot;Let us now praise men of renown, and our fathers in their generation&quot; (44:1). &quot;And their names continue for ever, the glory of the holy men remaining unto their children&quot; (44:15)

====Support====
St. Augustine, St. Ambrose, and others, give accounts of miracles that occurred at the graves of St. Stephen, St. Felix of Nola, St. Gervasius, and many others, in post-Biblical times. Such miraculous events are seen as divine favor for the veneration of relics.

==Hinduism==
Hinduism has a longstanding and living tradition of reverence toward sants (saints) and mahatmas (ascended masters), with the line often blurring between humanity and divinity in the cases of godmen and godwomen. The Bhakti movements popularized devotion to saintly figures such as , , and gurus as models showing the way to liberation.

==Islam==

Islam has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called &quot;wali&quot;, which literally means &quot;Friend [of God]&quot;), which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of Salafism. In Sunni Islam, the veneration of saints became a very common form of religious celebration early on, and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of &quot;special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.&quot; The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both &quot;loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.&quot; The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the Sufis, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law.

Veneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the Salafi movement, whose various streams regard it as &quot;being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.&quot; In a manner similar to the Protestant Reformation, the specific traditional practices which Salafism has tried to curtail in both Sunni and Shia contexts include those of the veneration of saints, visiting their graves, seeking their intercession, and honoring their relics. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: &quot;[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints…. [due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.&quot;

==Judaism==

While Orthodox and Organized Judaism don&#x27;t countenance the veneration of saints per se, veneration and pilgrimage to burial sites of holy Jewish leaders is an ancient part of the tradition.

It is common for some Jews to visit the graves of many righteous Jewish leaders. The tradition is particularly strong among Moroccan Jews, and Jews of Sephardi descent, although also by some Ashkenazi Jews as well. This is particularly true in Israel, where many holy Jewish leaders are buried. The Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Rachel&#x27;s Tomb in Bethlehem and that of Maimonides in Tiberius are examples of burial sites that attract large pilgrimages in the Near East. In America, the only such example is the grave site of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, at the Ohel, in the cemetery in Queens where he is buried alongside his father-in-law. During his lifetime, Schneerson himself would frequently visit the gravesite (Ohel) of his father-in-law, where he would read letters and written prayers, and then place them on the grave. Today, visitors to the grave of Schneerson include Jews of Orthodox, Reform and Conservative background, as well as non-Jews. Visitors typically recite prayers of psalms and bring with them petitions of prayers written on pieces of paper which are then torn and left on the grave.

==Jainism==
In Jainism, it recognizes the tirthankaras, which are beings who have achieved transcendence and liberation (moksha) and are, therefore, teachers who taught the Jain path. Away from the evolution of the cosmos and the cosmic event, they do not intervene in any way in it; they serve only as examples to follow. The latter is manifested in the offering ceremonies (&quot;devapuja&quot;), which constitute more of a renunciation on the part of the believer than a surrender, since the tirthankaras are totally indifferent to the affairs of men and the Jains assume that they are indifferent to them.

<doc id="185446" wikidata="Q6779998" url="?curid=185446" title="Mary Kay and Johnny">
<text>Mary Kay and Johnny is an American sitcom starring real-life married couple Mary Kay and Johnny Stearns. It was the first sitcom broadcast on a television network in the United States. &quot;Mary Kay and Johnny&quot; initially aired live on the DuMont Television Network before moving to CBS and then NBC.

==Format==
Plots centered around a bank employee and his &quot;zany, but not dumb&quot; wife and the problems that they encountered. Much of the activity occurred in the couple&#x27;s apartment in Greenwich Village.

The March 6, 1948, issue of the trade publication &quot;Billboard&quot; gave a mostly favorable review, &quot;This program comes close to being a model tele[vision] show. In detailing the adventures, mainly domestic, of a young married couple, Johnny and Mary Kay Stearns have come up with charming and fresh material, which always takes into consideration that there are cameras taking everything in,&quot; although the column&#x27;s author objected to the show&#x27;s usage of familiar sitcom tropes such as &quot;the dreary old tolerant-husband-with-a-dumb-wife pattern.&quot;

==Cast==
In addition to the Stearnses, the cast included their son, Christopher Stearns, as himself. Mary Kay&#x27;s mother was played by Nydia Westman, and Johnny&#x27;s friend Howie was played by Howard Thomas. Jim Stevenson was the announcer.

==Broadcast history==
The first 15-minute episode debuted on the DuMont Television Network on Tuesday, November 18, 1947. The Stearnses created and wrote all the scripts. The program was broadcast live, most of the action taking place on a set representing the New York City apartment of the title characters, a young married couple.

&quot;Mary Kay and Johnny&quot; was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman&#x27;s pregnancy on television: Mary Kay became pregnant in 1948 and after unsuccessfully trying to hide her pregnancy, the producers wrote it into the show. On December 31, 1948, the Stearns&#x27; weeks-old son Christopher appeared on the show and became a character.

After a year on DuMont, the show moved to CBS for half a year, much of the time being broadcast every weeknight, then ran for another year each Saturday night on NBC, where it debuted on October 10, 1948. It broadcast the final episode on March 11, 1950.

==Viewership==
At a time when there were no TV ratings (the A.C. Nielsen Company would not begin measuring TV ratings until 1950), Anacin decided to take a chance and sponsor the show. This decision worried the advertising executives at Anacin, who thought that they might be wasting money by sponsoring a show with a sparse audience. A simple, non-scientific scheme to gauge the size of the audience was hatched. During one commercial spot, Anacin offered a free pocket mirror to the first 200 viewers who wrote in requesting one. As a precaution, they purchased a total of 400 mirrors in case the audience was twice as large as they expected. Although the free mirror was offered only during that one spot, Anacin received nearly 9000 requests for mirrors.

==Episode status==
DuMont&#x27;s corporate successor, Metromedia, disposed of what was left of the DuMont archive in the East River.

The fate of the NBC episodes is unknown, although they also were known to have been getting rid of their older recordings in the early 1970s and disposing the ones they could not get the stars of the shows to take. The Paley Center for Media has one 1949 episode in its collection. TV Land used a clip of Mary Kay and Johnny in an episode of &quot;Inside TV Land&quot; called &quot;Taboo TV&quot;. However, this clip showed a scene of Mary Kay and Johnny together in a bed; the single episode held by The Paley Center for Media does not feature such a scene, so that would indicate at least one more episode survives.

<doc id="185447" wikidata="Q57157" url="?curid=185447" title="Hanna Reitsch">
<text>Hanna Reitsch (29 March 1912 – 24 August 1979) was a German aviator and test pilot. Along with Melitta von Stauffenberg, she flight-tested many of Germany&#x27;s new aircraft during World War II and received many honors. Reitsch was among the very last people to meet Adolf Hitler alive in the in late April 1945.

Reitsch set more than 40 flight altitude records and women&#x27;s endurance records in gliding and unpowered flight, before and after World War II. In the 1960s, she was sponsored by the West German foreign office as a technical adviser in Ghana and elsewhere, and founded a gliding school in Ghana, where she worked for Kwame Nkrumah.

==Early life and education==
Reitsch was born in Hirschberg, Silesia, on 29 March 1912 to an upper-middle-class family. She was daughter of Dr. Wilhelm (Willy) Reitsch, who was an ophthalmology clinic manager, and his wife Emy Helff-Hibler von Alpenheim, who was a member of the Austrian nobility. Despite her mother being a devout Catholic, Hanna was raised a Protestant. She had two siblings, brother Kurt, a naval &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; (frigate captain), and younger sister Heidi. Reitsch began flight training in 1932 at the School of Gliding in Grunau. While a medical student in Berlin, she enrolled in a German Air Mail amateur flying school for powered aircraft at Staaken, training in a Klemm Kl 25.

==Career==
===1933–1937===
In 1933, Reitsch left medical school at the University of Kiel to become, at the invitation of Wolf Hirth, a full-time glider pilot/instructor at Hornberg in Baden-Württemberg. Reitsch contracted with the Ufa Film Company as a stunt pilot and set an unofficial endurance record for women of 11 hours and 20 minutes.
In January 1934, she joined a South America expedition to study thermal conditions, along with Wolf Hirth, Peter Riedel and Heini Dittmar. While in Argentina, she became the first woman to earn the Silver C Badge, the 25th to do so among world glider pilots.

In June 1934, Reitsch became a member of the Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS) and became a test pilot in 1935. Reitsch enrolled in the Civil Airways Training School in Stettin, where she flew a twin-engine on a cross country flight and aerobatics in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44.
In 1937, Ernst Udet gave Reitsch the honorary title of after she had successfully tested Hans Jacobs&#x27;s divebrakes for gliders.
At the DFS she test-flew transport and troop-carrying gliders, including the DFS 230 that was used at the Battle of &quot;Fort Eben-Emael&quot;.

===1937–1945===
In September 1937, Reitsch was posted to the Luftwaffe testing centre at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield by Ernst Udet.

Her flying skill, desire for publicity, and photogenic qualities made her a star of Nazi propaganda. Physically she was petite and very slender, with blonde hair, blue eyes and a &quot;ready smile&quot;. She appeared in Nazi propaganda throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s.

Reitsch was the first female helicopter pilot and one of the few pilots to fly the Focke-Achgelis Fa 61, the first fully controllable helicopter, for which she received the Military Flying Medal. In 1938, during the three weeks of the International Automobile Exhibition in Berlin, she made daily flights of the Fa 61 helicopter inside the .

In September 1938, Reitsch flew the DFS Habicht in the Cleveland National Air Races.

Reitsch was a test pilot on the Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber and Dornier Do 17 light/fast bomber projects, for which she received the Iron Cross, Second Class, from Hitler on 28 March 1941.
Reitsch was asked to fly many of Germany&#x27;s latest designs, among them the rocket-propelled Messerschmitt Me 163 in 1942. And as such, she became the first and only woman in the world to fly a rocket plane. A crash landing on her fifth Me 163 flight badly injured Reitsch; she spent five months in a hospital recovering. Reitsch received the Iron Cross First Class following the accident, one of only three women to do so.

She was also the only woman to have flown the world&#x27;s biggest glider, the Messerschmitt Me 321 Gigant (Giant). She was instrumental in having a second pilot added to the Me 321. She was also the first woman in the world to fly a jet fighter (Me 262), and the only woman in the world to have flown a cruise missile (Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg). She was also likely to have been the first woman to fly a dive bomber (Ju 87).

In February 1943 after news of the defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, she accepted an invitation from &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Robert Ritter von Greim to visit the Eastern Front. She spent three weeks visiting Luftwaffe units, flying a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch.

====V1, 1944====

On 28 February 1944, she presented the idea of Operation Suicide to Hitler at Berchtesgaden, which &quot;would require men who were ready to sacrifice themselves in the conviction that only by this means could their country be saved.&quot; Although Hitler &quot;did not consider the war situation sufficiently serious to warrant them ... and ... this was not the right psychological moment&quot;, he gave his approval. The project was assigned to Gen. Günther Korten. About seventy volunteers enrolled in the Suicide Group as pilots for the human glider-bomb. By April 1944, Reitsch and Heinz Kensche finished tests of the Me 328, carried aloft by a Dornier Do 217. By then, she was approached by SS- Otto Skorzeny, a founding member of the (Leonidas Squadron). They adapted the V-1 flying bomb into the Fieseler Fi 103R Reichenberg, including a two-seater and a single-seater with and without the mechanisms to land. The plan was never implemented operationally, &quot;the decisive moment had been missed.&quot;

In her autobiography Reitsch recalled that after two initial crashes with the Fi 103R she and Heinz Kensche took over tests of the prototype Fi 103R. She made several successful test flights before training the instructors. &quot;Though an average pilot could fly the V1 without difficulty once it was in the air, to land it called for exceptional skill, in that it had a very high landing speed and, moreover, in training it was the glider model, without engine, that was usually employed.&quot;

In October 1944, Reitsch claimed she was shown a booklet by Peter Riedel which he had obtained while in the German Embassy in Stockholm, concerning the gas chambers. She further claimed that while believing it to be enemy propaganda, she agreed to inform Heinrich Himmler about it. When she did, Himmler is said to have asked whether she believed it, and she replied, &quot;No, of course not. But you must do something to counter it. You can&#x27;t let them shoulder this onto Germany.&quot; &quot;You are right,&quot; Himmler replied.

====Berlin, 1945====
During the last days of the war, Hitler dismissed Hermann Göring as head of the Luftwaffe and appointed Robert Ritter von Greim to replace him. Von Greim and Reitsch flew from Gatow Airport into embattled Berlin to meet Hitler in the , arriving on 26 April when Red Army troops were already in the central area of Berlin. Reitsch and von Greim had been flown from Rechlin–Lärz Airfield to Gatow Airfield in a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 (with Reitsch riding in the small plane&#x27;s fuselage), escorted by twelve other Fw 190s from Jagdgeschwader 26 under the command of Hans Dortenmann. In Berlin, Reitsch and von Greim took a Fi 156 —initially piloted by von Greim until his foot was struck by a bullet, then by Reitsch reaching over him to land on an improvised airstrip in the Tiergarten near the Brandenburg Gate and Berlin Victory Column. On 27 April, Hitler gave Reitsch two capsules of poison for herself and von Greim, which she accepted.

Shortly after midnight on 29 April, Hitler ordered Reitsch and von Greim to fly out of Berlin in an Arado Ar 96 (which had been flown to the Tiergarten by the pilot who stowed Reitsch in his fuselage), asserting that they could get General Walther Wenck to save Berlin. Von Greim was ordered to get the Luftwaffe to attack the Soviet forces that had just reached Potsdamer Platz and to make sure Himmler was punished for his treachery in making unauthorised contact with the Western Allies regarding surrender terms. Troops of the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, which was fighting its way through the Tiergarten from the north, tried to shoot the plane down fearing that Hitler was escaping in it, but it took off successfully.

====Capture, 1945====
Reitsch was soon captured along with von Greim and the two were interviewed together by U.S. military intelligence officers. When asked about being ordered to leave the on 29 April 1945, Reitsch and von Greim reportedly repeated the same answer: &quot;It was the blackest day when we could not die at our Führer&#x27;s side.&quot; Reitsch stated, &quot;We should all kneel down in reverence and prayer before the altar of the Fatherland,&quot; referring to the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;. Reitsch dismissed assertions of Hitler&#x27;s survival, saying, &quot;He had no reason to live and the tragedy was that he knew it ... perhaps better than anyone else did.&quot; Reitsch claimed Hitler was initially motivated by a will to &quot;make Germany healthy again&quot;, but gambled his populace. She criticised his incompetence as a leader (e.g. his selection of the wrong persons for office) and argued repeatedly that never again must an individual have so much control over any country. Reitsch was held for eighteen months; von Greim killed himself on 24 May 1945.

Evacuated from Silesia ahead of the Soviet troops, Reitsch&#x27;s family took refuge in Salzburg. During the night of 3 May 1945, after hearing a rumour that all refugees were to be taken back to their original homes in the Soviet occupation zone, Reitsch&#x27;s father shot and killed her mother and sister and her sister&#x27;s three children before killing himself.

===1945–1979===
After her release Reitsch settled in Frankfurt am Main. After the war, German citizens were barred from flying powered aircraft, but within a few years gliding was allowed, which she took up again. In 1952, Reitsch won a bronze medal in the World Gliding Championships in Spain; she was the first woman to compete and in 1955 she became German champion. She continued to break records, including the women&#x27;s altitude record () in 1957 and her first diamond of the Gold-C badge.

During the mid-1950s, Reitsch was interviewed on film and talked about her wartime flight tests of the Fa 61, Me 262 and Me 163.

In 1959, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru invited Reitsch, who spoke fluent English, to start a gliding centre, and she flew with him over New Delhi. In 1961, United States President John F. Kennedy invited her to the White House.

From 1962 to 1966, she lived in Ghana. The then Ghanaian President, Kwame Nkrumah invited Reitsch to Ghana after reading of her work in India. At Afienya she founded the first black African national gliding school, working closely with the government and the armed forces. The West German government supported her as technical adviser. The school was commanded by J.E.S. de Graft-Hayford, with gliders such as the double-seated Schleicher K7, Slingsby T.21 and a Bergfalke, along with a single-seated Schleicher K 8. She gained the FAI Diamond Badge in 1970. The project was evidently of great importance to Nkrumah and has been interpreted as part of a &quot;modernist&quot; development ideology.

Reitsch&#x27;s attitudes to race underwent a change. &quot;Earlier in my life, it would never have occurred to me to treat a black person as a friend or partner ...&quot; She now experienced guilt at her earlier &quot;presumptuousness and arrogance&quot;. She became close to Nkrumah. The details of their relationship are now unclear due to the destruction of documents, but some surviving letters are intimate in tone.

In Ghana, some Africans were disturbed by the prominence of a person with Reitsch&#x27;s past, but Shirley Graham Du Bois, a noted African-American writer who had emigrated to Ghana and was friendly towards Reitsch, agreed with Nkrumah that Reitsch was extremely naive politically. Contemporary Ghanaian press reports seem to show a lack of interest in her past.

Throughout the 1970s, Reitsch broke gliding records in many categories, including the &quot;Women&#x27;s Out and Return World Record&quot; twice, once in 1976 () and again, in 1979 (), flying along the Appalachian Ridges in the United States. During this time, she also finished first in the women&#x27;s section of the first world helicopter championships.

====Last interview, 1970s====
Reitsch was interviewed and photographed several times in the 1970s, towards the end of her life, by Jewish-American photojournalist Ron Laytner. In her closing remarks she is quoted as saying:

In the same interview, she is quoted as saying, 
==Death==

Reitsch died of a heart attack in Frankfurt at the age of 67, on 24 August 1979. She had never married. She is buried in the Reitsch family grave in the Salzburger Kommunalfriedhof.

Former British test pilot and Royal Navy officer Eric Brown said he received a letter from Reitsch in early August 1979 in which she said, &quot;It began in the bunker, there it shall end.&quot; Within weeks she was dead. Brown speculated that Reitsch had taken the cyanide capsule Hitler had given her in the bunker, and that she had taken it as part of a suicide pact with Greim. There is no record of an autopsy.

<text>XSD (XML Schema Definition), a recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. It can be used by programmers to verify each piece of item content in a document, to assure it adheres to the description of the element it is placed in.

Like all XML schema languages, XSD can be used to express a set of rules to which an XML document must conform to be considered &quot;valid&quot; according to that schema. However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document&#x27;s validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types. Such a post-validation &quot;infoset&quot; can be useful in the development of XML document processing software. 

==History==
XML Schema, published as a W3C recommendation in May 2001, is one of several XML schema languages. It was the first separate schema language for XML to achieve Recommendation status by the W3C. Because of confusion between XML Schema as a specific W3C specification, and the use of the same term to describe schema languages in general, some parts of the user community referred to this language as WXS, an initialism for W3C XML Schema, while others referred to it as XSD, an initialism for XML Schema Definition. In Version 1.1 the W3C has chosen to adopt XSD as the preferred name, and that is the name used in this article.

In its appendix of references, the XSD specification acknowledges the influence of DTDs and other early XML schema efforts such as DDML, SOX, XML-Data, and XDR. It has adopted features from each of these proposals but is also a compromise among them. Of those languages, XDR and SOX continued to be used and supported for a while after XML Schema was published. A number of Microsoft products supported XDR until the release of MSXML 6.0 (which dropped XDR in favor of XML Schema) in December 2006. Commerce One, Inc. supported its SOX schema language until declaring bankruptcy in late 2004.

The most obvious features offered in XSD that are not available in XML&#x27;s native Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are namespace awareness and datatypes, that is, the ability to define element and attribute content as containing values such as integers and dates rather than arbitrary text.

The XSD 1.0 specification was originally published in 2001, with a second edition following in 2004 to correct large numbers of errors. XSD 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation in April 2012.

== Schemas and schema documents ==
Technically, a schema is an abstract collection of metadata, consisting of a set of schema components: chiefly element and attribute declarations and complex and simple type definitions. These components are usually created by processing a collection of schema documents, which contain the source language definitions of these components. In popular usage, however, a schema document is often referred to as a schema.

Schema documents are organized by namespace: all the named schema components belong to a target namespace, and the target namespace is a property of the schema document as a whole. A schema document may &quot;include&quot; other schema documents for the same namespace, and may &quot;import&quot; schema documents for a different namespace.

When an instance document is validated against a schema (a process known as &quot;assessment&quot;), the schema to be used for validation can either be supplied as a parameter to the validation engine, or it can be referenced directly from the instance document using two special attributes, codice_1 and codice_2. (The latter mechanism requires the client invoking validation to trust the document sufficiently to know that it is being validated against the correct schema. &quot;xsi&quot; is the conventional prefix for the namespace &quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;.)

XML Schema Documents usually have the filename extension &quot;.xsd&quot;. A unique Internet Media Type is not yet registered for XSDs, so &quot;application/xml&quot; or &quot;text/xml&quot; should be used, as per RFC 3023.

==Schema components==
The main components of a schema are:

* Element declarations, which define properties of elements. These include the element name and target namespace. An important property is the type of the element, which constrains what attributes and children the element can have. In XSD 1.1, the type of the element may be conditional on the values of its attributes. An element may belong to a substitution group; if element E is in the substitution group of element H, then wherever the schema permits H to appear, E may appear in its place. Elements may have integrity constraints: uniqueness constraints determining that particular values must be unique within the subtree rooted at an element, and referential constraints determining that values must match the identifier of some other element. Element declarations may be global or local, allowing the same name to be used for unrelated elements in different parts of an instance document.
* Attribute declarations, which define properties of attributes. Again the properties include the attribute name and target namespace. The attribute type constrains the values that the attribute may take. An attribute declaration may also include a default value or a fixed value (which is then the only value the attribute may take.)
* Simple and complex types. These are described in the following section.
* Model group and attribute group definitions. These are essentially macros: named groups of elements and attributes that can be reused in many different type definitions.
* An attribute use represents the relationship of a complex type and an attribute declaration, and indicates whether the attribute is mandatory or optional when it is used in that type.
* An element particle similarly represents the relationship of a complex type and an element declaration, and indicates the minimum and maximum number of times the element may appear in the content. As well as element particles, content models can include model group particles, which act like non-terminals in a grammar: they define the choice and repetition units within the sequence of permitted elements. In addition, wildcard particles are allowed, which permit a set of different elements (perhaps any element provided it is in a certain namespace).

Other more specialized components include annotations, assertions, notations, and the schema component which contains information about the schema as a whole.

==Types==
Simple types (also called data types) constrain the textual values that may appear in an element or attribute. This is one of the more significant ways in which XML Schema differs from DTDs. For example, an attribute might be constrained to hold only a valid date or a decimal number.

XSD provides a set of 19 primitive data types (codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, and codice_21). It allows new data types to be constructed from these primitives by three mechanisms:
* restriction (reducing the set of permitted values),
* list (allowing a sequence of values), and
* union (allowing a choice of values from several types).

Twenty-five derived types are defined within the specification itself, and further derived types can be defined by users in their own schemas.

The mechanisms available for restricting data types include the ability to specify minimum and maximum values, regular expressions, constraints on the length of strings, and constraints on the number of digits in decimal values. XSD 1.1 again adds assertions, the ability to specify an arbitrary constraint by means of an XPath 2.0 expression.

Complex types describe the permitted content of an element, including its element and text children and its attributes. A complex type definition consists of a set of attribute uses and a content model. Varieties of content model include:
* element-only content, in which no text may appear (other than whitespace, or text enclosed by a child element)
* simple content, in which text is allowed but child elements are not
* empty content, in which neither text nor child elements are allowed
* mixed content, which permits both elements and text to appear
A complex type can be derived from another complex type by restriction (disallowing some elements, attributes, or values that the base type permits) or by extension (allowing additional attributes and elements to appear). In XSD 1.1, a complex type may be constrained by assertions—XPath 2.0 expressions evaluated against the content that must evaluate to true.

== Post-Schema-Validation Infoset ==

After XML Schema-based validation, it is possible to express an XML document&#x27;s structure and content in terms of the data model that was implicit during validation. The XML Schema data model includes:

* The vocabulary (element and attribute names)
* The content model (relationships and structure)
* The data types

This collection of information is called the Post-Schema-Validation Infoset (PSVI). The PSVI gives a valid XML document its &quot;type&quot; and facilitates treating the document as an object, using object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms.

==Secondary uses for XML Schemas==
The primary reason for defining an XML schema is to formally describe an XML document; however the resulting schema has a number of other uses that go beyond simple validation.

===Code generation===
The schema can be used to generate code, referred to as XML Data Binding. This code allows contents of XML documents to be treated as objects within the programming environment.

===Generation of XML file structure documentation===
The schema can be used to generate human-readable documentation of an XML file structure; this is especially useful where the authors have made use of the annotation elements. No formal standard exists for documentation generation, but a number of tools are available, such as the Xs3p stylesheet, that will produce high-quality readable HTML and printed material.

==Criticism==
Although XML Schema is successful in that it has been widely adopted and largely achieves what it set out to, it has been the subject of a great deal of severe criticism, perhaps more so than any other W3C Recommendation.
Good summaries of the criticisms are provided by James Clark, Anders Møller and Michael Schwartzbach, Rick Jelliffe and David Webber.

General problems:
* It is too complicated (the spec is several hundred pages in a very technical language), so it is hard to use by non-experts—but many non-experts need schemas to describe data formats. The W3C Recommendation itself is extremely difficult to read. Most users find W3Cs XML Schema Primer much easier to understand.
* XSD lacks any formal mathematical specification. (This makes it difficult to reason about schemas, for example to prove that a modification to a schema is backwards compatible.)
* There are many surprises in the language, for example that restriction of elements works differently from restriction of attributes.

Practical limitations of expressibility:
* XSD offers very weak support for unordered content.
* XSD cannot require a specific &quot;root element&quot; (so extra information is required to validate even the simplest documents).
* When describing &quot;mixed content&quot;, the character data cannot be constrained in any way (not even a set of valid characters can be specified).
* &quot;Content and attribute declarations cannot depend on attributes or element context&quot; (this was also listed as a central problem of DTD).
* It is &quot;not 100% self-describing&quot; (as a trivial example, see the previous point), even though that was an initial design requirement.
* &quot;Defaults&quot; cannot be specified separately from the declarations (this makes it hard to make families of schemas that only differ in the default values); &quot;element defaults&quot; can only be character data (not containing markup).

Technical problems:
* Although it technically is namespace-conformant, it does not seem to follow the namespace spirit (e.g. &quot;unqualified locals&quot;).
* XSD 1.0 provided no facilities to state that the value or presence of one attribute is dependent on the values or presence of other attributes (so-called &quot;co-occurrence constraints&quot;). This has been fixed in XSD 1.1.
* The set of XSD datatypes on offer is highly arbitrary.

* The two tasks of validation and augmentation (adding type information and default values) should be kept separate.

==Version 1.1==
XSD 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation in April 2012, which means it is an approved W3C specification.

Significant new features in XSD 1.1 are:

*The ability to define assertions against the document content by means of XPath 2.0 expressions (an idea borrowed from Schematron).
*The ability to select the type against which an element will be validated based on the values of the element&#x27;s attributes (&quot;conditional type assignment&quot;).
*Relaxing the rules whereby explicit elements in a content model must not match wildcards also allowed by the model.
*The ability to specify wildcards (for both elements and attributes) that apply to all types in the schema, so that they all implement the same extensibility policy.

Until the Proposed Recommendation draft, XSD 1.1 also proposed the addition of a new numeric data type, precisionDecimal. This proved controversial, and was therefore dropped from the specification at a late stage of development.

<doc id="185450" wikidata="Q298233" url="?curid=185450" title="Esophageal atresia">
<text>Esophageal atresia is a congenital medical condition (birth defect) that affects the alimentary tract. It causes the esophagus to end in a blind-ended pouch rather than connecting normally to the stomach. It comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus. It is characterized anatomically by a congenital obstruction of the esophagus with interruption of the continuity of the esophageal wall.

==Pathophysiology==

The genetic causes of EA/TEF include chromosome anomalies or variants in genes involved in critical developmental processes which are dosage sensitive. Several EA/TEF risk genes have been discovered include the transcriptional regulators SOX2, MYCN, CHD7, FANCB, and members of FOX transcription factor family.

Others plausible candidate genes in the etiology of EA/TEF were identified as APC2, AMER3, PCDH1, GTF3C1, POLR2B, RAB3GAP2, and ITSN1.

==Signs and symptoms==
This birth defect arises in the fourth fetal week, when the trachea and esophagus should begin to separate from each other.

It can be associated with disorders of the tracheoesophageal septum.

===Complications===
Any attempt at feeding could cause aspiration pneumonia as the milk collects in the blind pouch and overflows into the trachea and lungs. Furthermore, a fistula between the lower esophagus and trachea may allow stomach acid to flow into the lungs and cause damage. Because of these dangers, the condition must be treated as soon as possible after birth resulting in emergency neonatal surgery.

===Associated birth defects===
Other birth defects may co-exist, particularly in the heart, but sometimes also in the anus, spinal column, or kidneys. This is known as VACTERL association because of the involvement of Vertebral column, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheal, Esophageal, Renal, and Limbs. It is associated with polyhydramnios in the third trimester.

==Diagnosis==
This condition may be visible, after about 26 weeks, on an ultrasound. On antenatal USG, the finding of an absent or small stomach in the setting of polyhydramnios was considered a potential symptom of esophageal atresia. However, these findings have a low positive predictive value. The upper neck pouch sign is another sign that helps in the antenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and it may be detected soon after birth as the affected infant will be unable to swallow its own saliva.

On plain X-ray, a feeding tube will not be seen pass through the esophagus and remain coiled in the upper oesophageal pouch.

===Classification===
This condition takes several different forms, often involving one or more fistulas connecting the trachea to the esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula).

==Treatment==
Treatments for the condition vary depending on its severity. The most immediate and effective treatment in the majority of cases is a surgical repair to close the fistula/s and reconnect the two ends of the esophagus to each other. Although this is usually done through an incision between the ribs on right side of the baby, a technique using three small incisions (thoracoscopy) is being used at some centers.

In a minority of cases, the gap between upper and lower esophageal segments may be too long to bridge. In these situations traditional surgical approaches include gastrostomy followed by gastric pull-up, colonic transposition and jejunum transposition. Gastric pull-up has been the preferred approach at many specialized centers, including Great Ormond Street (London) and Mott Children&#x27;s Hospital (Ann Arbor). Gastrostomy, or G-tube, allows for tube feedings into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Often a cervical esophagostomy will also be done, to allow the saliva which is swallowed to drain out a hole in the neck. Months or years later, the esophagus may be repaired, sometimes by using a segment of bowel brought up into the chest, interposing between the upper and lower segments of esophagus.

In some of these so-called long gap cases, though, an advanced surgical treatment developed by John Foker, MD, may be utilized to elongate and then join the short esophageal segments. Using the Foker technique, surgeons place traction sutures in the tiny esophageal ends and increase the tension on these sutures daily until the ends are close enough to be sewn together. The result is a normally functioning esophagus, virtually indistinguishable from one congenitally well formed. Unfortunately, the results have been somewhat difficult to replicate by other surgeons and the need for multiple operations has tempered enthusiasm for this approach. The optimal treatment in cases of long gap esophageal atresia remains controversial.

Magnetic compression method is another method for repairing long-gap esophageal atresia. This method does not require replacing the missing section with grafts of the intestine or other body parts. Using electromagnetic force to attract the upper and lower ends of the esophagus together was first tried in the 1970s by using steel pellets attracted to each other by applying external electromagnets to the patient. In the 2000s a further refinement was developed by Mario Zaritzky&#x27;s group and others. The newer method uses permanent magnets and a balloon.
# The magnets are inserted into the upper pouch via the baby&#x27;s mouth or nose, and the lower via the gastrotomy feeding tube hole (which would have had to be made anyway to feed the baby, therefore not requiring any additional surgery).
# The distance between the magnets is controlled by a balloon in the upper pouch, between the end of the pouch and the magnet. This also controls the force between the magnets so it is not strong enough to cause damage.
# After the ends of the esophagus have stretched enough to touch, the upper magnet is replaced by one without a balloon and the stronger magnetic attraction causes the ends to fuse (anastomosis).

In April 2015 Annalise Dapo became the first patient in the United States to have their esophageal atresia corrected using magnets.

==Complications==
Postoperative complications may include a leak at the site of closure of the esophagus. Sometimes a stricture, or tight spot, will develop in the esophagus, making it difficult to swallow. Esophageal stricture can usually be dilated using medical instruments. In later life, most children with this disorder will have some trouble with either swallowing or heartburn or both. Esophageal dismotility occurs in 75-100% of patients. After esophageal repair (anastomosis) the relative flaccidity of former proximal pouch (blind pouch, above) along with esophageal dysmotility can cause fluid buildup during feeding. Owing to proximity, pouch ballooning can cause tracheal occlusion. Severe hypoxia (&quot;dying spells&quot;) follows and medical intervention can often be required.

Tracheomalacia a softening of the trachea, usually above the carina (carina of trachea), but sometimes extensive in the lower bronchial tree as well—is another possible serious complication. A variety of treatments for tracheomalacia associated with esophageal atresia are available. If not severe, the condition can be managed expectantly since the trachea will usually stiffen as the infant matures into the first year of life. When only the trachea above the carina is compromised, one of the &quot;simplest&quot; interventions is aortopexy wherein the aortic loop is attached to the rear of the sternum, thereby mechanically relieving pressure from the softened trachea. An even simpler intervention is stenting. However, epithelial cell proliferation and potential incorporation of the stent into the trachea can make subsequent removal dangerous.

The incidence of asthma, bronchitis, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and recurrent infections in adolescent and adult esophageal atresia survivors far exceeds that of their healthy peers. During the first decade of surgical repair of EA, as much as 20% of patients died from pneumonia. From there on, pneumonia has remained as a major pulmonary complication and a reason for readmissions after repair of EA. The risk factors of pneumonia within the first five years of life include other acute respiratory infections and high number of esophageal dilatations.

==Epidemiology==
It occurs in approximately 1 in 3000 live births.

Congenital esophageal atresia (EA) represents a failure of the esophagus to develop as a continuous passage. Instead, it ends as a blind pouch. Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus. EA and TEF can occur separately or together. EA and TEF are diagnosed in the ICU at birth and treated immediately.

The presence of EA is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation (drooling) and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking, coughing and sneezing. When fed, these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth. The infant may become cyanotic (turn bluish due to lack of oxygen) and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated (sucked into) the trachea. The cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm (a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea). Over time respiratory distress will develop.

If any of the above signs/symptoms are noticed, a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance. If resistance is noted, other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular x-ray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending. Sometimes a small amount of barium (chalk-like liquid) is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems. However, performing such an oral contrast study is not advised due to a risk of aspiration.

Treatment of EA and TEF is surgery to repair the defect. If EA or TEF is suspected, all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started. The infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration. Babies with EA may sometimes have other problems. Studies will be done to look at the heart, spine and kidneys. Surgery to repair EA is essential as the baby will not be able to feed and is highly likely to develop pneumonia. Once the baby is in condition for surgery, an incision is made on the side of the chest. The esophagus can usually be sewn together. Following surgery, the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time. Care for each infant is individualized. It&#x27;s very commonly seen in a newborn with imperforate anus.

<text>Tiddleywink is a hamlet consisting of eight cottages on the B4039 road, near the village of Yatton Keynell, about northwest of Chippenham, Wiltshire, England. The name is said to derive from rhyming slang for &quot;a quick drink&quot;, one of its cottages historically being known to serve beer to passing cattle drovers.

Because of its small size, Tiddleywink has been for many years omitted from the official book of place names, the &quot;Collins British Atlas and Gazetteer&quot;, and from most maps. It has been shown, however, that it was recognised as a settlement in the 1881 census, when it had a total of 28 residents.

Early in 2003, after much campaigning, residents won their settlement two new road signs and widespread recognition as their story made the national news.

<doc id="185461" wikidata="Q2203278" url="?curid=185461" title="Murder of Gwen Araujo">
<text>Gwen Amber Rose Araujo (February 24, 1985 – October 4, 2002) was an American teenager who was murdered in Newark, California, at the age of 17. She was murdered by four men, two of whom she had been sexually intimate with, who beat and strangled her after discovering that she was transgender. Two of the defendants were convicted of second-degree murder, but not the requested hate-crime enhancements to the charges. The other two defendants pleaded guilty or no-contest to voluntary manslaughter. In at least one of the trials, a &quot;trans panic defense&quot;—an extension of the gay panic defense—was employed.

Merel and Magidson were sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Merel was granted early parole in 2016, after reportedly showing extensive remorse to Araujo&#x27;s mother, who supported the decision. Magidson, however, has reportedly never shown remorse and has been denied parole three times since his sentencing.

==Victim==
Gwen Araujo was born on February 24, 1985, in Brawley, California, to Edward Araujo and Sylvia Guerrero. Her parents divorced when she was 10 months old.

Araujo came out as transgender in 1999 at the age of 14, and began using the name &quot;Gwen&quot; after her favorite musician, Gwen Stefani, but also went by &quot;Wendy&quot; and &quot;Lida&quot;. She began to grow her hair long and planned to undergo hormone treatment and surgery. Her older sister said that she was bullied in junior high school because of her voice and bearing. She transferred to an alternative high school, but did not return for the 2002–03 academic year.

==Background==
Araujo first met Michael Magidson, José Merel, Jaron Nabors, and Jason Cazares in late August or early September 2002. The night they met Araujo, she flirted with all four men and they smoked marijuana together. After she left, Nabors asked the other three, &quot;Could this be a dude?&quot;, but none of the four men took the thought seriously. Later, she engaged in oral sex with Magidson and anal sex with Merel. She claimed to be menstruating and, during sex, would push her partners&#x27; hands away from her genitalia to prevent them from discovering that she had a penis.

Nicole Brown, who was dating Paul Merel (José&#x27;s older brother) and was acquainted with Araujo, said that she and Araujo had engaged in a physical fight after Brown challenged Araujo to strip for the men. Araujo surprised her with a strong blow during the fight, and Brown said the men &quot;were tripping, because she was smaller than me and just as strong. She fought like a guy.&quot; The four men debated in late September whether Araujo was female, concluding that &quot;something bad could happen&quot; to her if she was not.

===Confrontation===
On the night of October 3, 2002, Araujo attended a party at a house rented by José and Paul Merel, attended by them, their younger brother Emmanuel Merel, Michael Magidson, Jaron Nabors, Jason Cazares, and Nicole Brown. Nabors later testified that José Merel said that night, &quot;I swear, if it&#x27;s a f— man, I&#x27;m gonna kill him. If it&#x27;s a man, she ain&#x27;t gonna leave.&quot; According to Nabors, Magidson added &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do&quot;, and Nabors replied, &quot;Whatever you do, make sure you don&#x27;t make a mess.&quot; Brown said the four men were out at a club together and did not return to the house until after midnight.

In the early morning hours of October 4, Magidson asked Araujo to reveal her sex or allow him to touch her genitals, which she refused. Brown suggested that one of them should inspect Araujo, and Magidson took Araujo to the bathroom. After half an hour, during which José Merel later confessed he had sex with Araujo, Brown went to the bathroom, where she discovered Araujo had male genitalia during a forced inspection. Brown was surprised and blurted out, &quot;It&#x27;s a f— man!&quot;, and the men with whom she had had sexual relations became enraged and violent. Brown testified that she warned Araujo that the men were &quot;very angry&quot;, but upon exiting through the front door, Araujo was confronted and forced back inside the house by Magidson, Nabors, and Cazares. Emmanuel Merel testified that he also tried to escort Araujo away from the house, but was prevented by Magidson and Nabors.

José Merel vomited upon learning Araujo had male genitalia, then began to cry in disbelief, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t be f— gay.&quot; Brown testified that she tried to comfort Merel after the discovery, saying &quot;It&#x27;s not your fault. I went to high school with you, and you were on the football team. Any woman that knows you after this, it&#x27;s not going to matter. Just let her go.&quot;

After Araujo was brought back into the house, Magidson grabbed at her skirt and underwear in an attempt to expose her genitals. He then proceeded to punch her in the face, knocking her to the ground, and put her in a chokehold, but he was pulled off by others. Araujo begged the men to stop, saying &quot;No, please don&#x27;t. I have a family.&quot; José Merel became angry and struck her in the head with a can of food, denting the can and opening a cut on her head, and then he struck her again with a frying pan. The last words Merel heard Araujo speak were &quot;I told you I was sorry.&quot;

At some point after that, Brown woke Paul Merel, and they left the house with Emmanuel Merel. Emmanuel Merel later testified he walked to a convenience store to buy gum, then went to a friend&#x27;s house to spend the night.

Nabors and Cazares left in Magidson&#x27;s truck to retrieve shovels and a pickaxe from Cazares&#x27;s house, saying as they left the Merel house that the other men were going to &quot;kill that b—&quot;. Brown recalled that after she had left with Paul Merel, they drove around the block and returned to the house to see Nabors and Cazares leaving in Magidson&#x27;s truck.

===Murder===
When Nabors and Cazares returned, Araujo was still conscious, bleeding from her head wound and sitting on the couch. José Merel became concerned that Araujo was bleeding on the couch and ordered her off it. At some point, the assault resumed. Nabors and Cazares urged the others to &quot;knock the b— out&quot;, according to Nabors&#x27;s testimony. Magidson hit her head against the living room wall with his knee, rendering her unconscious. Nabors testified that Magidson&#x27;s assault was so severe it left a dent in the wall and cracked the plaster. Cazares kicked her. Merel was concerned with cleaning Araujo&#x27;s blood off the couch and carpet before retreating to his room so the others would not see him crying.

After Araujo was knocked unconscious, Magidson bound her wrists and ankles, then she was wrapped in a comforter to minimize the amount of blood staining the carpet, before being carried to the garage of the home. After this, the defendants&#x27; testimonies diverge.

Nabors testified that Magidson strangled her with a rope and that Cazares struck her with a shovel, but Nabors was returning from the garage and did not actually witness the act of strangulation. Referring to Araujo as &quot;Lida&quot;—the name she had used with them—Nabors testified that he saw Magidson raising the rope to her neck before he left the garage and that Magidson later told the others &quot;that he had wrapped the rope around Lida&#x27;s neck and twisted it.&quot;

Magidson testified that it was instead Nabors who strangled her and struck her with the shovel, and Cazares testified that he never struck her and did not see her die. José Merel testified he was cleaning Araujo&#x27;s blood out of the carpets and couch as Magidson was binding her ankles, prior to her being taken to the garage. Merel also said he thought she was still alive until he saw her body in the bed of Magidson&#x27;s truck. It is not clear at what point during this sequence of events she died. However, the autopsy showed that she died from strangulation associated with blunt force trauma to the head. According to Nabors, Magidson &quot;wasn&#x27;t sure if Lida had died from twisting the rope, but once Jason hit her twice with the shovel, he knew she was dead&quot;.

She was then placed in the bed of a pick-up truck, and the four men drove her body four hours away, burying her near the Sierra Nevada mountains in a shallow grave in the El Dorado National Forest near Silver Fork Road in El Dorado County. On their way home, they purchased breakfast at a McDonald&#x27;s drive-through window. Later that morning, during a phone conversation, Brown asked José Merel what happened, to which he replied &quot;Let&#x27;s just say she had a long walk home.&quot;

==Arrests==
The partygoers did not report the crime and the assailants said nothing to anyone about the murder. Araujo usually checked in with her mother, so when she did not come home the day after the party, her mother called the police on October 5 to report her missing. Police did not initially take the missing persons case seriously, partly because she was transgender, and also because she was known to stay away from home overnight. Rumors reached her family that a girl who had been outed as transgender at a party had been killed and buried in Tahoe, and her aunt called the police on October 9 to pass on the story. Police began to interview the partygoers, and one of them led the police to the Merels&#x27; house.

Two days after Araujo was reported missing, a friend of Jaron Nabors described him as appearing distraught. Nabors had confessed to a friend what the four had done shortly after returning from the grave site. That friend tipped off the police and agreed to wear a microphone during a subsequent conversation with Nabors about the murder. Confronted with the recording, Nabors agreed to lead authorities to the body on October 15.

The Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office dispatched four crime scene investigators and two detectives to recover Araujo&#x27;s body from the grave site. The four who were initially arrested and accused of the murder were Magidson (age 22); Nabors (19), José Merel (22), and Paul Merel.

Paul Merel was released after Brown and Emmanuel Merel told the police that he had left the scene with them. Magidson, Nabors, and José Merel were charged with murder on October 17 and held without bail. On October 24, Nabors pleaded not guilty, Magidson was still looking for an attorney, and José Merel was still reviewing the evidence against him. In an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Merel was confident that charges would be dropped.

After he was arrested, Nabors wrote a letter to a girlfriend in which he stated the defendants had discussed a &quot;Soprano-type plan&quot; to &quot;kill the b— and get rid of her body&quot;. The letter was intercepted by sheriff&#x27;s officials and led to the arrest of Cazares on November 19. Cazares had been identified as a potential witness on October 22. At the first trial, defense attorney Tony Serra accused Nabors of writing the letter knowing it would be intercepted and implicate Cazares.

== Trials ==

===Jaron Nabors===
Nabors pleaded guilty on February 24, 2003, to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, which carried an 11-year prison sentence, along with a promise to testify against the other three defendants. During the formal entry of his plea, Judge Kenneth Burr warned Nabors that he could still be charged with murder if prosecutors found he was not &quot;living up to your end of the bargain&quot;.

During the February 2003 indictment proceedings, Nabors gave a detailed account of the murder and burial. As they were burying her, the men continued to disparage her. Nabors testified that he stated he &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe that someone would ever do that, would be that deceitful&quot; and that José Merel added &quot;he was so mad he could still kick her a couple more times&quot;.

Nabors received an 11-year sentence on August 25, 2006. With credit for time served, he was expected to spend approximately five years in jail from that point on.

===Magidson, Merel, and Cazares===
====First trial====
Before the first trial, the prosecuting attorney, Alameda County deputy district attorney Chris Lamiero argued that simply being transgender should not have been a death sentence:

Jury selection for the trial of Magidson, José Merel, and Cazares began on March 15, 2004. Prospective jurors were asked if they knew any lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender people; whether they knew any recently married same-sex couples; whether they had met any transgender people; or whether they had seen a &quot;movie or theatrical performance depicting the activities of a transgender person&quot;. One of the defense attorneys explained the last question had specifically asked if prospective jurors had watched the film &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; or the play &quot;The Laramie Project&quot;, but was changed over defense concerns that by being so specific, those who had not would be prompted to watch them.

The first trial began on April 14, 2004. Prosecuting attorney Lamiero deadnamed Araujo, using male pronouns and her birth name to refer to her, saying the defendants had decided &quot;that the wages of Eddie Araujo&#x27;s sin of deception were death&quot;. In his opening statement, the defense attorney for Magidson argued that he should not be charged with murder, rather manslaughter at worst, under California law. Magidson&#x27;s attorney said that his client was not biased but had been shocked &quot;beyond reason&quot; to learn he had unwittingly had sex with a &quot;man&quot;: a variant of the gay panic defense. During his testimony, Nabors said he felt his friends had been raped, since Araujo (whom he referred to as male) &quot;did not come clean with being what he really was. I feel like he forced them into homosexual sex, and my definition of rape was being forced into sex.&quot; When asked how she forced them, Nabors answered, &quot;Through deception.&quot;

The first trial ended in a mistrial on June 22 following nine days of deliberations, when the jurors were unable to reach a unanimous decision for the three men. While the jury agreed that Araujo had been murdered, they could not agree whether it was premeditated. The final votes were 10–2 in favor of acquitting Merel and Cazares of first-degree murder, and 7–5 in favor of convicting Magidson of first-degree murder. Although they were given the option of convicting the men of second-degree murder or manslaughter, they were unable to proceed past the first-degree murder deliberations.

One of the jurors wrote a newspaper article after the mistrial; in it, he credited Cazares&#x27;s defense attorney, Tony Serra, with introducing enough reasonable doubt about the veracity of the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses, including both Brown (who had admitted to consuming more than a dozen beers that night) and Nabors (who was characterized as a liar and &quot;chameleon&quot;, prone to exaggeration and eager to please in every social situation).

====Second trial====
The second trial began on May 31, 2005. Publicity by transgender activists was credited with informing the public about the tactics the defense lawyers had adopted to blame Araujo for her own death, changing the approach to the case. The day after the first trial ended in a mistrial, a court granted Araujo&#x27;s mother&#x27;s petition for a posthumous name change, requiring the defense lawyers to refer to the victim with female pronouns. Magidson, Merel, and Cazares were charged with first-degree murder with hate-crime enhancements.
The three defendants testified in this trial—and blamed each other as well as Nabors. Nabors, testifying for the prosecution, stated that Magidson admitted to strangling Araujo. Merel testified that Nabors was responsible for the major head injuries to Araujo, but supported the assertion that Magidson had strangled her. Magidson testified that Nabors admitted he had strangled Araujo. During Magidson&#x27;s testimony, a tape of his initial interview with the police was shown, in which an investigator was recorded coaching him to use the trans panic defense: &quot;You&#x27;d be surprised. Moms—especially moms—if they knew the facts—you&#x27;d be surprised.&quot;

During the closing statements of the second trial, Cazares&#x27; defense lawyer Tony Serra argued that the three defendants were &quot;ordinary human beings&quot; who were guilty, at most, of manslaughter for their role in the death in a &quot;classic state of heat and passion&quot;. Serra also argued that Cazares took no active role in killing her. To avoid a second mistrial, prosecuting attorney Chris Lamiero argued for a first-degree murder conviction, but gave jurors the option of a second-degree murder conviction for the three, or even manslaughter for Merel. He asked the jury to return first-degree murder convictions of Magidson and Cazares, fingering Magidson as the main culprit who had strangled Araujo and calling him &quot;a poor excuse for a man&quot; with a &quot;stupid and moronic&quot; list of excuses for murdering her.

On September 8, the jury announced that it had reached verdicts on two of the three defendants. As Judge Harry Sheppard instructed, the verdicts were kept secret.

On September 12, after a week of deliberation, the jury announced its verdicts. It had deadlocked on Cazares, voting 9–3 in favor of convicting him for murder. Magidson and Merel were each convicted on the charge of second-degree murder, but not convicted of the hate-crime enhancement allegations. After the trial, one of the jurors stated in an interview with the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that the murder conviction was because &quot;The community standard is not and cannot be that killing is something a reasonable person would have done that night&quot; but not hate crimes since the murder was believed to have been committed not because Araujo was transgender, but to &quot;cover up a situation that had gotten out of control&quot;.

Lamiero had undermined criminal intent by commenting, &quot;Gwen being transgender was not a provocative act. It&#x27;s who she was. However, I would not further ignore the reality that Gwen made some decisions in her relation with these defendants that were impossible to defend ... I don&#x27;t think most jurors are going to think it&#x27;s OK to engage someone in sexual activity knowing they assume you have one sexual anatomy when you don&#x27;t.&quot;

Michael Magidson and José Merel were sentenced in January to 15 years to life in prison, for second-degree murder. While Merel expressed deep sorrow and regret to Araujo&#x27;s family, Magidson was angry about his verdict and expressed &quot;no remorse&quot; for his role in murdering Araujo, according to presiding Judge Harry Sheppard.

====Jason Cazares====
To avoid a third trial, Cazares pleaded no contest to manslaughter on December 16, 2005, and was sentenced to six years in prison, with credit for time already served. Attorney Gloria Allred represented Araujo&#x27;s family. Cazares asked to begin serving his sentence after the birth of his third child, scheduled for March or April 2006, which was granted, although Lamiero noted &quot;it&#x27;s difficult for me to entertain a request like that when Gwen Araujo is dead&quot;. According to Lamiero, Cazares was willing to plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact, but that deal was rejected because the sentence was just three years and admitted no culpability in the murder.

==Aftermath==
Gwen Araujo was mourned in a public funeral at St. Edwards Catholic Church in Newark on October 25, 2002. Fred Phelps and the members of Phelps&#x27;s Westboro Baptist Church promised to picket the funeral, but did not. There were people there that picketed with signs, but friends wore angel wings to block the casket from the signs. She was cremated, and her mother Sylvia Guerrero retained the urn with her ashes.

TransVision, a comprehensive health and social services program for transgender people in Alameda County, was founded in 2002 and operated by Tri-City Health Center after the murder of Gwen Araujo.

At the request of Guerrero, a judge posthumously changed the victim&#x27;s legal name to &quot;Gwen Amber Rose Araujo&quot; on June 23, 2004. &quot;Amber Rose&quot; was the name Guerrero had chosen before her child was born, in the event it was a girl.

On the first anniversary of the murder, Horizons Foundation created the &quot;Gwen Araujo Memorial Fund for Transgender Education&quot;. The fund&#x27;s purpose was to support school-based programs in the nine-county Bay Area that promote understanding of transgender people and issues through annual grants. Through this fund, Sylvia Guerrero and her family spoke in middle and high schools about transgender awareness and understanding. By 2005, Guerrero had spoken to more than 20 schools. The fund was closed sometime before September 2020.

Sylvia Guerrero, Araujo&#x27;s mother, worked as a legal assistant at a San Jose law firm, but, , was homeless due to PTSD from the incident. Guerrero has been unable to return to work and now moves her belongings from relatives&#x27; houses using a borrowed car from her friend. , Guerrero was staying with her son but was still too traumatized to return to work.

===Media portrayals===
* A Lifetime movie titled &quot;A Girl Like Me: The Gwen Araujo Story&quot;, starring J. D. Pardo and Mercedes Ruehl, first aired in June 2006.
* The case was also the subject of a 2007 documentary, &quot;Trained in the Ways of Men&quot;. This documentary by Michelle Prevost examines the 2002 murder, and aims to debunk the so-called gay panic (or trans panic) defense.
* &quot;Deadly ID&quot;, an episode of Investigation Discovery&#x27;s &quot;Fatal Encounters&quot; (season 1 episode 8, first aired May 7, 2012) explored the crime&#x27;s timeline from both Araujo&#x27;s and Magidson&#x27;s dramatized perspectives.
* An episode of the Investigation Discovery&#x27;s &quot;Murder Among Friends&quot; titled &quot;Murder Party&quot; (season 2 episode 4) aired on July 6, 2017. The episode examines the case using dramatizations of the background of Araujo, events leading up to her murder and the aftermath. It also examines the backgrounds of the killers and their friends, how they got caught, and interviews with the victim&#x27;s mother, friends, and the victim&#x27;s advocates, along with showing actual photos of her and her murderers and explaining how the court trials went.

===California legislation===
In September 2006, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed the &quot;Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act&quot; (AB 1160) into law. The law limited the use by criminal defendants of the &quot;gay/trans panic defense&quot; by allowing parties to instruct jurors not to let bias influence their decisions, including &quot;bias against the victim&quot; based on his or her &quot;gender identity, or sexual orientation&quot;. The law put California on record as declaring it contrary to public policy for defendants to be acquitted or convicted of a lesser included offense on the basis of appeals to &quot;societal bias&quot;.

In September 2014, California Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill No. 2501 into law. The law further restricted the use of the gay/trans panic defense by amending California&#x27;s manslaughter statute to prohibit defendants from claiming that they were provoked to murder by discovering a victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity. AB 2501 was introduced by Assemblywoman Susan A. Bonilla in partnership with Equality California. In announcing the bill&#x27;s introduction they cited the murder of Araujo and the 2008 murder of gay California teen Larry King.

===Parole and release===
Jason Cazares was released from prison in July 2012.

Jaron Nabors was released from prison some time before 2016.

José Merel was granted parole in 2016 with the support of Sylvia Guerrero.

Michael Magidson said he was not ready for release at his first parole board hearing in 2016, and his request for parole was also opposed by Guerrero. Magidson has since had two more parole hearings, which occurred in September 2019 and August 2024, and was denied parole both times. He will be eligible for parole again in 2029.

<text>Canary Wharf is an area of London, England, located near the Isle of Dogs in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Canary Wharf is defined by the Greater London Authority as being part of London&#x27;s central business district, alongside Central London. Alongside the City of London, it constitutes one of the main financial centres in the United Kingdom and the world, containing many high-rise buildings including the third-tallest in the UK, One Canada Square, which opened on 26 August 1991.

Developed on the site of the former West India Docks in East London, Canary Wharf contains around of office and retail space. It has many open areas and gardens, including Canada Square, Cabot Square, Westferry Circus, Jubilee Park, and Crossrail Place Roof Garden. Together with Heron Quays and Wood Wharf, it forms the Canary Wharf Estate, around in area.

==History==
 
Canary Wharf is located on the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs. As journalist José Luis Jiménez explains, the name of this location stems from its use during World War II as a storage area for agricultural exports—primarily tomatoes, cucumbers, and bananas—from the Canary Islands. Its remote position, far from the city center, even included the Canarian Docks on its outskirts.

===West India Dock Company===
From 1802 to the late 1980s, what would become the Canary Wharf Estate was a part of the Isle of Dogs (Millwall), Limehouse, and Poplar and was one of the busiest docks in the world. West India Docks was primarily developed by Robert Milligan (–1809) who set up the West India Dock Company.

===Port of London Authority===
The Port of London Authority was established in 1909 and took control of West India Dock. The enterprise of Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a Welsh shipping magnate who was a prominent figure in the Canary Islands, Spain, led to a constant stream of ships arriving into London&#x27;s South Quay Dock and the naming of Canary Wharf, after the ships&#x27; origin. It was named after No. 32 berth of the West Wood Quay of the Import Dock. This was built in 1936 for Fruit Lines Ltd, a subsidiary of Fred Olsen Lines for the Mediterranean and Canary Islands fruit trade. It is located on the Isle of Dogs, the quay and warehouse were given the name Canary Wharf.

===London Docklands Development Corporation===
After the 1960s, when cargo became containerised, port industry began to decline, leading to all the docks being closed by 1980. After the docks closed in 1980, the British Government adopted policies to stimulate redevelopment of the area, including the creation of the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) in 1981 and the granting of Urban Enterprise Zone status to the Isle of Dogs in 1982.

The Canary Wharf of today began when Michael von Clemm, former chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), came up with the idea to convert Canary Wharf into a back office. Further discussions with G Ware Travelstead led to proposals for a new business district and included the LDDC developing an inexpensive light metro scheme, the Docklands Light Railway, to make use of a large amount of redundant railway infrastructure and to improve access.

The project was sold to the Canadian company Olympia &amp; York and construction began in 1988, master-planned by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill with Yorke Rosenberg Mardall as their UK advisors, and subsequently by Koetter Kim. The first buildings were completed in 1991, including One Canada Square, which became the UK&#x27;s tallest building at the time and a symbol of the regeneration of Docklands. By the time it opened, the London commercial property market had collapsed, and Olympia and York Canary Wharf Limited filed for bankruptcy in May 1992.

Initially, the City of London saw Canary Wharf as an existential threat. It modified its planning laws to expand the provision of new offices in the City of London, for example, creating offices above railway stations (Blackfriars) and roads (Alban Gate). The resulting oversupply of office space contributed to the failure of the Canary Wharf project.

===Canary Wharf Group===
In October 1995, an international consortium that included investors such as Alwaleed, bought control for $1.2 billion. Paul Reichmann, of Olympia &amp; York, was named chairman, and Canary Wharf went public in 1999. The new company was called Canary Wharf Limited, and later became Canary Wharf Group.

In 1997, some residents living on the Isle of Dogs launched a lawsuit against Canary Wharf Ltd for private nuisance because the tower interfered with TV signals. The residents lost the case.

Recovery in the property market generally, coupled with continuing demand for large floorplate Grade A office space, slowly improved the level of interest. A critical event in the recovery was the much-delayed start of work on the Jubilee Line Extension, which the government wanted ready for the Millennium celebrations.

In March 2004, Canary Wharf Group plc. was taken over by a consortium of investors, backed by its largest shareholder Glick Family Investments and led by Morgan Stanley using a vehicle named Songbird Estates plc.

== Tallest buildings ==

In addition to being a leading global financial district in the United Kingdom, Canary Wharf is famous for a cluster of the tallest modern commercial complexes and residential high-rise buildings. Building from scratch in early 1990s, the district is home to the first tallest iconic skyscraper, One Canada Square, in the United Kingdom. In 20 years, Canary Wharf&#x27;s new rapid grown skyscraper cluster has dramatically transformed the skyline of London with modern architectures., and for this reason the area is often nicknamed &quot;Manhattan-on-Thames&quot;.

* The 75-storey Landmark Pinnacle is the tallest residential tower in the United Kingdom and the whole of western Europe.
* Newfoundland is the tallest build-to-rent building in the United Kingdom.
* Novotel London Canary Wharf is the tallest all-hotel building in the United Kingdom, and the tallest Novotel in the world.
* One Canada Square, at , achieved a 21-year record of the tallest building in the United Kingdom from 1991 to 2012. With its distinctive pyramid pinnacle, the building is recognised as a London landmark, and has been featured in many films and television shows.

<doc id="185467" wikidata="Q503477" url="?curid=185467" title="One Canada Square">
<text>One Canada Square is a skyscraper in Canary Wharf, London. It is the third tallest building in the United Kingdom at above ground level, and contains 50 storeys. It achieved the title of the tallest building in the UK upon completion in 1991 and held the title for 21 years until the completion of The Shard (310m) in 2012.

One Canada Square was designed by César Pelli with Adamson Associates and Frederick Gibberd Coombes. The building is clad with stainless steel. One of the predominant features of the building is the pyramid roof, which contains a flashing aircraft warning light, a rare feature for buildings in the United Kingdom. The distinctive pyramid pinnacle is above sea level.

One Canada Square is primarily used for offices, though there are some retail units on the lower ground floor. There is no observation floor. It is a prestigious location for offices and as of October 2017 was completely let. The building is recognised as a London landmark, and it has gained much attention through film, television, and other media as one of the tallest buildings in the United Kingdom.

== History and design ==

=== Original plans ===
The original plans for a business district on Canary Wharf came from G Ware Travelstead. He proposed three 260 m (850 ft) towers. Travelstead was unable to fund the project, so the plans were sold to Olympia &amp; York in 1987. Olympia &amp; York grouped all three towers into an area known as Docklands Square, and the main tower was designated DS7 during planning. Docklands Square was later renamed Winston Square before finally being renamed as Canada Square.

=== Architects/design ===
The architects chosen to design One Canada Square were César Pelli &amp; Associates, Adamson Associates, and Frederick Gibberd Coombes &amp; Partners. They designed the tower with a similar shape to 200 Vesey Street (formerly Three World Financial Center), New York City, which was also developed by Olympia &amp; York and designed by Argentine architect César Pelli. The shape was also made reminiscent of &quot;Big Ben&quot;. Olympia &amp; York wanted to clad One Canada Square in stone, just like Peli&#x27;s World Financial Center towers constructed in 1986, but the architects first wanted to use aluminium for its low density, before insisting on steel to reflect Britain&#x27;s heritage as an industrial nation. The final steel clad chosen was Patten Hyclad Cambric-finish stainless-steel.

Commenting on the reason for choosing steel for the clad:
&quot;We studied the cladding material carefully and chose stainless steel with a linen finish because it seemed to fit the atmosphere of London.&quot;
:::—César Pelli, architect (2016)

One Canada Square was originally designed to be high at 55 storeys, but that penetrated the permitted projection height of the flight obstruction area of the airport approach district to London City Airport, but this was extended to a height of above kerb level in consideration of the fact that One Canada Square was on the external zone of the airport approach. To comply with air traffic safety regulations, the architects took five floors off the tower. The final height of was permitted, otherwise, the developers would have had to dismantle what was necessary to fit the height restriction. After losing five floors, Olympia &amp; York insisted the other floors had to make up the lost floor space by increasing mass to the remaining floor space which created a tower that was not as slim as Pelli desired. Pelli and the other architects proposed alternatives, such as building more floors below ground and creating an extension of the tower into Docklands Square, which were similar ideas based upon previous Olympia &amp; York buildings, though the ideas were rejected as it did not fit the basis of prime office space.

The design of the tower received a fair share of criticism. According to César Pelli, the most damaging criticism came from Prince Charles, who said on national television, &quot;I personally would go mad if I had to work in a place like that&quot;. Other criticisms came from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who said that the building was &quot;not quite stunning&quot;.

=== Construction ===
Construction on the tower began in 1988. Construction was given to Sir Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons in association with EllisDon of Toronto, but they were slow at building the tower, partly due to building workers going on strike in the summer of 1989, so Lehrer McGovern took over. Lehrer McGovern contracted out most of the work to Balfour Beatty because the Canary Wharf Tower was a difficult building to build. In total, about 27,500 metric tonnes of British steel and 500,000 bolts were used during construction. Construction also involved building a huge cofferdam to seal construction from water. It also involved driving 222 piles into the ground at 23 metres deep. Also, a 4-metre thick concrete raft was sunk into the dock to act as anchor.

By June 1990, the tower had overtaken Tower 42 (previously known as the NatWest Tower), becoming the tallest building in the United Kingdom.

On 8 November 1990, the tower was topped out when the top piece of the pyramid roof was put in place by crane.

The celebration was attended by many famous architects, recognised engineers and political leaders. Amongst them were César Pelli, Brian Mulroney, Peter Rice, Man-Chung Tang, and Margaret Thatcher. Paul Reichmann, the owner of Olympia &amp; York gave credit to Pelli for his building design as &quot;this inauguration symbolises the spirit with which buildings can be achieved&quot;. Margaret Thatcher told the distinguished audience that the tower can become a &quot;national recognised landmark&quot;.

=== Opening ===
In August 1991, One Canada Square was completed and open for business. His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh officially opened One Canada Square on the morning of 26 August 1991, and unveiled a commemorative plaque at the entrance to the building. Hundreds of construction workers attended the opening ceremony. The Duke of Edinburgh
addressed some 800 invited guests, many of whom had been involved in the project. He spoke of the &quot;large, airy space and clean, efficient office layout&quot;, as he declared the building ready for business. The attendees heard a specially-commissioned piece of music performed by a 30-strong choir. Paul Reichmann, Chairman of Olympia &amp; York said:
&quot;The Canary Wharf Tower marks the start of a new beginning for Canary Wharf, for London, and for the United Kingdom. It is by any standard a triumph of ambition, commitment and collaboration. It will breathe life into Canary Wharf, allowing us to continue our transformation of the rest of the wharf, and will put Canary Wharf at the leading edge of real estate.&quot;
:::—Paul Reichmann, Chairman, Olympia &amp; York (1991)

=== Post-completion ===
The majority of the tower was empty after opening because most tenants had not moved in yet and there was a global recession. To brighten up the tower, lights and lasers were installed during the Christmas celebrations of 1991.

====Park Pavilion====
In 2009, the building was extended with Park Pavilion, a two-story glass structure built on the east side of the building, designed by César Pelli and Koetter Kim. The extension replaced the stainless steel columns, car parking spaces and road leading to Canada Square. The extension was made to create more retail space at street level, where five tenants were chosen to occupy the space: four restaurants and Lloyds Bank. The extension&#x27;s roof terrace is open to diners and contains a green roof having sedum moss.

== Building technical details ==

=== Building name ===
The name given to the building by the developers is &#x27;One Canada Square&#x27;, but it is often incorrectly called &#x27;Canary Wharf Tower&#x27; or simply &#x27;Canary Wharf&#x27;.

=== Building height ===

The Civil Aviation Authority shows the building at 
above ground level, or above sea level.

=== Pyramid roof ===

The pyramid roof is an important feature of the building, enclosing a maintenance plant and housing facilities for water supply and window washing, and an aircraft warning beacon. The pyramid itself is 40 metres high
and 30 metres square at the base. It is made from stainless steel and is held together by 100,000 nuts and bolts, with a weight of over 100 tons. A louvre access door opens to allow a shining beacon to identify the building to passing aircraft.

The pyramid is metal louvres that are self-cleaning with rainwater.

Architect César Pelli commented on his pyramid design:
&quot;The pyramidal form makes a three-dimensional building of what would otherwise be just folded planes. It also strengthens the Axis Mundi, the vertical line that goes through skyscrapers and connects Heaven with Earth. This connection has been recognised in many cultures for several centuries now.&quot;
:::—César Pelli, architect (2016)

==== Water ====
Water is pumped up to the pyramid roof, and is continuously replenished. A common sound that is heard inside the pyramid roof is water being moved around. The water is used for general water requirements, such as toilets, etc. The tower consumes an average of of water per day.

====Window washing machines====
The building maintenance units for washing the building windows are stored on the roof. There are two BMUs on the roof, both of these machines for cleaning the windows are supported by rails that run around the outside of the pyramid roof and that are bolted down into the maintenance floor itself.
====Aircraft warning lights====
The aircraft warning light is at the very top of the pyramid. Access is via a ladder with a warning sign stating that unauthorised entry will lead to dismissal. The tower uses an omni-directional light usual for marking hazards. It has a very long life and requires little maintenance. Light intensity achieved is well in excess of the required 2,000 candelas. It uses low power consumption and the unit can be flashing or steady.

==== Electrical equipment ====
There is electrical equipment that regulates the power to the rest of the building on the mezzanine floor. Some of the electrical generators on the mezzanine floor are powered by micro-hydro water turbines, sourced by water pumped up to the roof.

==== Roof material ====
The steel comprises a galvanised steel core, with a multi-layered protective coating and granular finish for better performance characteristics. The tile is in three satin finishes and a high-gloss silver and can be transported in situ in a building&#x27;s roof.

==== Cleaning the roof ====
The pyramid itself is cleaned by special maintenance personnel who abseil from the light beacon opening at the very top of the roof. Not only do they have to deal with the height, as well as the winds that interfere with their ropes, but they also need to inspect the steel roof.

==== Pyramid roof lights ====
The pyramid roof lights up in the evenings and can be seen away. It is a permanent lighting of the One Canada Square pyramid using a thousand electronically controlled fluorescent tubes capable of sequence programming for special occasions and festive seasons. The 4000 lights are highly energy efficient, and have an annual running cost of £23,360, rather than £116,800 if traditional incandescent bulbs had been used.

==== Lightning conductors ====
One Canada Square uses a traditional roof circuit for its lightning protection system. The roof holds 5 lightning conductor rods. This rooftop network of conductors contain multiple conductive copper paths from the roof to the ground. The steel cladding does not form part of the lightning protection system, as it was considered too dangerous.

=== HVAC ===
At the peak cooling times, the HVAC (climate control) system requires cooling equivalent to that provided by 2,000 t of melting ice in one day. The building has a condensate collection system, which uses the hot and humid outside air, combined with the cooling requirements of the building and results in a significant amount of condensation of moisture from the air. The condensed water is collected and drained into a holding tank located in the basement car park.

===Windows===

One Canada Square has 3,960 windows and was one of the first buildings to incorporate metallicised windows and other advanced window technologies, to assist with the building&#x27;s energy efficiency plans. The tower uses super-insulated windows at triple-pane glazing (with a high solar heat-gain coefficient), low-emissivity (low-e) coatings to prevent heat loss in winter months, UV coatings, scratch resistant outer layers, sealed argon / krypton gas filled inter-pane voids, &#x27;warm edge&#x27; insulating glass spacers, air-seals and specially developed thermally designed window frames. The windows were manufactured with high R-values [low U-values, 0.90 W/(m2.K)] for the time, thereby the thermal resistance is one of the highest rated in the world for the entire window including the frame.

=== External lighting ===

The tower uses low energy consumption external lighting through intelligent lighting controls systems. This computer controlled system generates the visually interesting lighting displays on the exterior of the building. The uplighters that are usually seen on the exterior of the building are inductive fluorescent lamps that can be colour rendered and dimmed. The floodlights use compact fluorescent lamps used to provide controlled lighting at the base of the tower. The lighting control system has photocells that will automatically switch on the display when it is dark.

The tower also has a synchronised building exterior decorative light and laser multimedia display. The technology was developed by Australian firm Laservision and cost approximately £2 million.

=== Fire system ===
In the event of a fire, One Canada Square is not fully evacuated. The floor that has the fire and all other floors above are evacuated. The air conditioning is set to work in reverse to extract smoke and fresh air is blown into the fire escape staircases to increase air pressure and therefore slow the entry of smoke into these areas. The sprinkler system will not operate unless there is sufficient heat acting on any sprinkler head (which are independent of each other and do not operate in unison).

The only time when One Canada Square was fully evacuated was on 30 October 2001, during a test drill in response to the 11 September 2001 attacks. The test drill was unsuccessful as tenants were notified beforehand, hence evacuation was much quicker than expected by Canary Wharf Security.

====Procedure for fire alarm====
When the fire alarm activates on a floor, audio instructions tailored to each floor of the building sound. All floors will receive an evacuation message, with a controlled evacuation message replayed to each floor in order of priority. On floors below the source of the alarm a stand-by notification is given. Digital signage throughout the building displays alert messages followed by instructions tailored to each floor of the building. On certain floors, the instructions ask employees to leave the floor. Exit signs flash. The access control system unlocks doors as necessary. Fire dampers open. Throughout the building, cameras turn on and look for problems that intelligent video software applications have been programmed to detect. Within 2 minutes, the access control system sends a memo to the Security Director itemising how many people have left the affected floor and how many remain.

=== Tuned mass damper ===
One Canada Square has a steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper. The pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts of wind. The building can sway in the strongest winds.

=== Lobby ===

The lobby is high, clad in Italian Rosso Levanto and Verde Imperial Guatemalan marbles imported from Italy, Guatemala and Turkey.

The marble clad under steel ceilings gives the impression of:
&quot;Rather than entering a corporate reception, you feel as if you&#x27;re entering a hushed antespace of timeless power.&quot;
:::—Herbert Wright, Johnny Tucker, Journalist [architecture] (2016)

==== Security screens====
In February 2017, security in the lobby was extended to include security screens to prevent unauthorised entry to the lifts. This was a follow-up to YouTuber Night Scape gaining unauthorised entry from the lobby to the roof.

=== Lifts ===
The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten floors of the building. All tenant passenger lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor and there is no level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen&#x27;s lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building&#x27;s initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for goods lift and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses &#x27;Gearless Traction Elevators&#x27; by Otis. These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a gearless traction machine. They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached to the top of the lift cabin and wrapped around the drive sheave in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up and down in the hoistway on its own guiderails. It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new goods lift GL37).

=== Observation floor ===
There is currently no public observation floor. However, there was an exception from 12 October 1992 to 15 December 1992, when bankruptcy administrators for Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf Limited opened the 50th floor to the public, to maintain interest in Canary Wharf. The scheme was stopped on 15 December 1992 when the IRA attempted to bomb the tower (see Terrorism section).

===Environmental rating===
The international BREEAM standard has awarded One Canada Square for best practice in sustainable design and environmental performance for buildings. To achieve the rating, the building had to meet or exceed a challenging score of 85% against strict criteria, and included environmental innovations such as the use of 80% recycled aggregate within the concrete used, and the recycling of waste heat to cool and warm the building. Aggregates used in the office build were from predominantly recycled sources, part of a strategy to integrate sustainable products and materials throughout the site, delivering both affordable and sustainable environmentally friendly features to the building.

One Canada Square energy performance has improved by decreasing 30% from 2007 to 2016 by initiatives such as installing LEDs and upgrading HVAC and water services.

=== General figures ===
* average floor size
* 4,388 internal steps
* 130,000 deliveries to the loading bay each year
* 9,975 people working in the tower

===Public access===

The ground floor, foyer area and basement levels of One Canada Square are open to the general public, having an underground retail area and a transport interchange from Canary Wharf tube and Docklands Light Railway stations. Access from the basement also links to Canada Square shopping mall. The floors above the lobby are not open to the public, as they contain offices.

===Art works===

==== Permanent art works ====
There are many art works on display in the lobby. This includes the stained glass and the roundel in the foyer were designed by Charles Rennie, and are an original design. The design represents Canary Wharf, Water and Boats, illustrating the signs of London Docklands. The slate used here and in various places around the foyer on site is made from the Welsh slate shelving used in the repositories of the original Banana Warehouse at Canary Wharf.

The staircases in the four corners of the lobby leading down to the basement floor were originally embellished with a four-piece commissioned sculpture, &quot;The 20th Century–Thames&quot; by Keith Milow. Around 2014, one of the tondi was removed to make room for a restaurant. The other three remain in situ.

Other art works on display included Sergio Germariello&#x27;s Guerrieri (Warriors) 2013, which is displayed in the lobby. The work is an aluminium laser cut out that has been painted.

Blade of Venus 1985, by William Turnbull, is on display, part of a series of bronzes that originated in the shape of Japanese swords and Chinese chopping knives.

Lawson Oyekan&#x27;s Trail With Light (LIP) Series 1998, are terracotta vessels on permanent display. The concept is that it is supposed to reflect emotional experience and look as if they have been exploded and put back together again.

==== Temporary art works ====
The lobby is also used for temporary art displays. In 2017, the artist Richard Rome showed several of his bronze and steel sculptures here. This was followed by an exhibition of bronze sculptures by Auguste Rodin.

Canary Wharf Winter Lights usually are on display during January.

During 16 April - 1 June 2018, the lobby hosted a photography exhibition known as AOP50 (Association of Photographers 50 years celebration). Large photographs were on display by famous photographers. Notable works included:
* Jullian Edelstein, Nelson Mandela, 1997
* Duffy, Jean Shrimpton, 1963
* Spencer Rowell, L&#x27;Enfant, 1986
* Tessa Traeger, Chemistry of Light, No 22 and 23, 2012

=== Ownership ===
The ownership of One Canada Square has changed since it was constructed. The table below shows who have previously owned One Canada Square, and also who are the current owners.

Any use of a holding company has been excluded from this list, as it is easier to trace the true owner.

=== Maintenance ===
Canary Wharf Management Ltd are responsible for the maintenance of the building. There are about 130 in-house and contract staff who maintain, manage, secure and clean the building. There are normally ten maintenance personnel on-site during working hours and three at night to attend to routine repairs and adjustments to the internal environment. Critical spare parts for the electricity, gas and water systems are kept within the building.

=== Light usage ===

One Canada Square has been &#x27;named and shamed&#x27; for being the top building to leave the lights on unnecessarily. The research carried out by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out&quot; programme found that on midnight Sunday, One Canada Square left more lights on than any other building in London.

However, Canary Wharf Group said that some tenants have staff working around the clock, and 100% of the energy comes from renewable resources.

=== Charity abseil events ===
One Canada Square regularly holds charity abseiling events during weekends. Various charities are given permission to use the building for their abseil challenges to raise money. Participants abseil down from the pyramid roof to street level. Abseilers normally use only 2 ropes and have to put up with windy conditions at 800 feet, whilst enjoying the views of London as they abseil down the steel cladding.

The first abseil was on 21 July 2001, when a team of Royal Marines, and members of various companies including a team led by David Levy from HSBC, and this team, raised in excess of £45,000 for 5 different children&#x27;s charities. The event earned a World Record and was covered by BBC Record Breakers.

=== Height ranking ===

=== Titles ===
One Canada Square achieved the title of tallest skyscraper in the UK in August 1991 upon building completion (as of CTBUH guidelines), or June 1990 (during construction when it overtook Nat West Tower). It held the record until 2012 when The Shard was completed. It became the third tallest building in the United Kingdom in 2019 upon completion of 22 Bishopsgate.

One Canada Square never achieved the title as tallest skyscraper in the European Union because in accordance to the CTBUH method, a building has to be &quot;completed&quot; before its receives its title, with Messeturm in Frankfurt being completed in 1990.

=== Terrorism ===
On 15 November 1992, the Provisional Irish Republican Army attempted to place a large improvised explosive device near the tower. The IRA had already worked out that to cause maximum damage, the bomb had to be placed under the Docklands Light Railway bridge to disrupt infrastructure near the Canary Wharf Tower for a devastating effect. The bomb was in a van which was driven to the designated place. As the bombers were about to make their escape, security guards approached the van because it was parked illegally on double yellow lines. Two men got out of the vehicle and one pointed a revolver at one of the security guards. The gun failed to fire. The terrorists were then pursued as far as the boundary of the wharf, but they escaped. Armed police were on the scene within minutes and the army bomb squad discovered that the vehicle contained a bomb. The detonator failed to ignite the main charge, and the bomb did not go off, so there was no bomb damage to Canary Wharf. The wharf was sealed off for a couple of days whilst an intensive search took place for further devices. A few days later, the IRA described it as &#x27;sheer ill luck&#x27; as the bomb failed to detonate. There was criticism that the intelligence services did not know about this massive bomb travelling through London. As a result of this attempted bombing, the observation floor was closed (see Public access section) and security was dramatically increased at Canary Wharf.

On 9 February 1996, the Provisional IRA successfully detonated a large bomb at South Quay, south of Canary Wharf (outside Canary Wharf), which killed two people and devastated several buildings. This explosion is commonly, but erroneously, referred to as the &quot;Canary Wharf bomb&quot;.

The towers at Canary Wharf were evacuated as a precaution following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in the United States.

There have been many news articles in recent years stating that the towers at Canary Wharf have been a target for terrorism. However, some of these plots have been denied by the government. One plot was confirmed on 4 April 2008, when a terror cell appeared at Woolwich Crown Court accused of targeting Canary Wharf. The men denied the charges, but were found guilty for planning attacks on the Canary Wharf skyscrapers.

=== Community relations ===

==== Television interference ====
As the Canary Wharf Tower is the first skyscraper to be clad in stainless steel with metallised windows, this may have caused analog television reception interference for local people living in the area. In the case &quot;Patricia Hunter and others v. Canary Wharf Ltd.[1997]&quot;, the House of Lords concluded there is no legal right to receive good television reception. Patricia Hunter and others lost the case because of a variety of reasons that included:

* the BBC built a new relay station so there was no long-term television interference
* it was interference with a purely recreational facility, as opposed to interference with the health or physical comfort or well-being of the plaintiffs
* nothing was emitted from the defendants&#x27; land

In Spring 2001, the BBC received some television interference complaints from residents in the Poplar area (north of Canary Wharf). A possible cause for the interference are the other Canary Wharf towers being built. Their advice was to get digital television, satellite or cable.

=== In popular culture ===

==== Cinema ====
One Canada Square has been featured in several films. 
* In the high-profile film &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, James Bond sails past One Canada Square. 
* In the 2003 spy comedy film &quot;Johnny English&quot;, One Canada Square had another identical building next to it, where one of the One Canada Square buildings was a hospital and the other was the headquarters of villain Pascal Sauvage.
* In the 2004 action-thriller film &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; One Canada Square was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as its London listening station. 
* In the 2007 post-apocalyptic horror film &quot;28 Weeks Later&quot;, the tower and the surrounding Docklands area are one of the main settings for the film.
* In the 2007 fantasy film &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;, Harry Potter and some members of the Order of the Phoenix pass next to One Canada Square as they head to Grimmauld Place on their broomsticks.

Other films featuring the Canary Wharf Tower can be read from a publication called &quot;Canary Wharf And Isle of Dogs Movie Map&quot;.

==== Television ====
One Canada Square has appeared many times on British television. 
* It has appeared in the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (in the episodes &quot;Army of Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Doomsday&quot;), as the location of the Torchwood Institute, under the name &quot;Torchwood Tower&quot;. In the episodes, a hall on the top floor contains a hole to a parallel universe that the tower was specifically built to reach.
* It has appeared in the series &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, as the headquarters for Sam Rees.
* The tower also made multiple appearances on the television show &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.
* The popular BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot;. 
* It was also shown as the headquarters of the fictional &#x27;Olympic Deliverance Commission&#x27; in the BBC comedy &quot;Twenty Twelve&quot;, a mockumentary based on the organising committee of the London 2012 Olympic Games. LOCOG, the real-life organising committee of the Games, was in fact based in nearby buildings One Churchill Place, 10 Upper Bank Street and 25 Canada Square.

During the 1990s, One Canada Square was home to the television station &quot;L!VE TV&quot;, which broadcast live from the tower.

==== Literature ====
* A near future sequence in the novel &quot;Freezeframes&quot; by Katharine Kerr, shows One Canada Square as a free college and youth drop-in centre. It is nicknamed &quot;Major&#x27;s Last Erection&quot;, referring to John Major.
* One Canada Square previously appeared in the &quot;Virgin Missing Adventures&quot; novel &quot;Millennial Rites&quot; in which the top floor was the headquarters of a yuppie who inadvertently turned London into a &quot;dark fantasy&quot; kingdom in which he was a powerful sorcerer, with the tower as his citadel
* The &quot;Past Doctor Adventures&quot; novel &quot;The Time Travellers&quot;, in which it was the headquarters of the British Army in an alternate timeline.
* One Canada Square also features prominently in an early issue of the Grant Morrison comic series &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, in which Dane MacGowan is encouraged to jump from the top by his mentor, Tom O&#x27;Bedlam, as an initiation rite that will allow him to see beyond reality and join The Invisibles.

==== Video games ====
* One Canada Square is featured in &quot;Sim City 3000&quot; as a placeable landmark.

<text>Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy was an American radio sitcom about black characters, initially set in Chicago then later in the Harlem section of New York City. While the show had a brief life on 1950s television with black actors, the 1928 to 1960 radio show was created, written and voiced by two white actors, Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll, who played Amos Jones (Gosden), Andrew Hogg Brown (Correll), and George &quot;Kingfish&quot; Stevens (Gosden) as well as incidental characters. On television from 1951 to 1953, black actors took over the majority of the roles; white characters were infrequent.

&quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; began as one of the first radio comedy series and originated from station WMAQ in Chicago. After the first broadcast in 1928, the show became a hugely popular series, first on NBC Radio and later on CBS Radio and Television. Later episodes were broadcast from the El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs, California. The show ran as a nightly radio serial (1928–43), as a weekly situation comedy (1943–55) and as a nightly disc-jockey program (1954–60). A television adaptation ran on CBS (1951–53) and continued in syndicated reruns (1954–66). It was not shown to a nationwide audience again until 2012.

==Origins==
Gosden and Correll were white actors familiar with minstrel traditions. They met in Durham, North Carolina in 1920. Both men had some scattered experience in radio, but it was not until 1925 that the two appeared on Chicago&#x27;s WQJ. Their appearances soon led to a regular schedule on another Chicago radio station, WEBH, where their only compensation was a free meal. The pair hoped that the radio exposure would lead to stage work; they were able to sell some of their scripts to local bandleader Paul Ash, which led to jobs at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; station WGN in 1925. This lucrative offer enabled them to become full-time broadcasters. The Victor Talking Machine Company also offered them a recording contract.

Since the &quot;Tribune&quot; syndicated Sidney Smith&#x27;s popular comic strip &quot;The Gumps&quot;, which had successfully introduced the concept of daily continuity, WGN executive Ben McCanna thought a serialized version would work on radio. He suggested that Gosden and Correll adapt &quot;The Gumps&quot; for radio. The idea seemed to involve more risk than either Gosden or Correll was willing to take; neither was adept at imitating female voices, which would have been necessary for &quot;The Gumps&quot;. They were also conscious of having made names for themselves with their previous act. By playing the roles of characters using minstrel dialect, they would be able to conceal their identities enough to be able to return to their old pattern of entertaining if the radio show proved to be a failure.

Instead, they proposed a series about &quot;a couple of colored characters&quot; that borrowed certain elements from &quot;The Gumps&quot;. Their new show, &quot;Sam &#x27;n&#x27; Henry&quot;, began on January 12, 1926 and fascinated radio listeners throughout the Midwestern United States. It became so popular that in 1927 Gosden and Correll requested that it be distributed to other stations on phonograph records in a &quot;chainless chain&quot; concept that would have been the first radio syndication. When WGN rejected the proposal, Gosden and Correll quit the show and the station; their last musical program for WGN was announced in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; on January 29, 1928. Episodes of &quot;Sam &#x27;n&#x27; Henry&quot; continued to air until July 14, 1928. Correll&#x27;s and Gosden&#x27;s characters contractually belonged to WGN, so the pair was unable to use the characters&#x27; names when performing in personal appearances after leaving the station.

WMAQ, the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; station, hired Gosden and Correll and their former WGN announcer Bill Hay to create a series similar to &quot;Sam &#x27;n&#x27; Henry&quot;. It offered higher salaries than WGN as well as the right to pursue the syndication idea. The creators later said that they named the characters Amos and Andy after hearing two elderly African-Americans greet each other by those names in a Chicago elevator. &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; began on March 19, 1928 on WMAQ, and prior to airing each program, Gosden and Correll recorded their show on 78-rpm discs at Marsh Laboratories, operated by electrical recording pioneer Orlando R. Marsh. Early 1930s broadcasts of the show originated from the El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs, California.

For the program&#x27;s entire run as a nightly series in its first decade, Gosden and Correll provided over 170 male voice characterizations. With the episodic drama and suspense heightened by cliffhanger endings, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; reached an ever-expanding radio audience. It was the first radio program to be distributed by syndication in the United States, and by the end of the syndicated run in August 1929, at least 70 other stations carried recorded episodes.

==Early storylines and characters==
Amos Jones and Andy Brown worked on a farm near Atlanta, Georgia, and during the first week&#x27;s episodes, they made plans to find a better life in Chicago, despite warnings from a friend. With four ham-and-cheese sandwiches and $24, they bought train tickets and headed for Chicago, where they lived in a rooming house on State Street and experienced some rough times before launching their own business, the Fresh Air Taxi Company. (The first car they acquired had no windshield; the pair turned it into a selling point.) By 1930, the noted toy maker Louis Marx and Company was offering a tin wind-up version of the auto, with Amos and Andy inside. The toy company produced a special autographed version of the toy as gifts for American leaders, including Herbert Hoover. There was also a book, &quot;All About Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy and Their Creators&quot;, in 1929 by Correll and Gosden (reprinted in 2007 and 2008), and a comic strip in the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;.

Naïve but honest Amos was hardworking, and, after his marriage to Ruby Taylor in 1935, also a dedicated family man. Andy was a gullible dreamer with overinflated self-confidence who tended to let Amos do most of the work. Their &quot;Mystic Knights of the Sea&quot; lodge leader, George &quot;Kingfish&quot; Stevens, would often lure them into get-rich-quick schemes or trick them into some kind of trouble. Other characters included John Augustus &quot;Brother&quot; Crawford, an industrious but long-suffering family man; Henry Van Porter, a social-climbing real estate and insurance salesman; Frederick Montgomery Gwindell, a hard-charging newspaperman; Algonquin J. Calhoun, a somewhat crooked lawyer added to the series in 1949, six years after its conversion to a half-hour situation comedy; William Lewis Taylor, Ruby&#x27;s well-spoken, college-educated father; and Willie &quot;Lightning&quot; Jefferson, a slow-moving Stepin Fetchit–type character.

There were three central characters: Correll voiced Andy Brown while Gosden voiced both Amos and the Kingfish. The majority of the scenes were dialogues between either Andy and Amos or Andy and Kingfish. Amos and Kingfish rarely appeared together. Since Correll and Gosden voiced virtually all of the parts, the female characters, such as Ruby Taylor, Kingfish&#x27;s wife Sapphire, and Andy&#x27;s various girlfriends, did not initially appear as voiced characters, but entered plots through discussions among the male characters. Prior to 1931, when Madame Queen (then voiced by Gosden) took the witness stand in her breach-of-promise lawsuit against Andy, a feminine voice was heard only once. Beginning in 1935, actresses began voicing the female characters, and after the program converted to a weekly situation comedy in 1943, other actors were recruited for some of the supporting male roles. However, Correll and Gosden continued to voice the three central characters on radio until the series ended in 1960. Two black actresses continued their radio roles on the television series: Ernestine Wade, who played Sapphire, Kingfish&#x27;s wife, and Amanda Randolph, who played her mother.

With the listening audience increasing in spring and summer 1928, the show&#x27;s success prompted sponsor Pepsodent Company to bring it to the NBC Blue Network on August 19, 1929. With the Blue Network not heard on stations in the Western United States, many listeners complained to NBC that they wanted to hear the show but could not. Under a special arrangement, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; debuted coast-to-coast November 28, 1929, on NBC&#x27;s Pacific Orange Network and continued on the Blue. WMAQ was then an affiliate of CBS and its general manager tried, to no avail, to interest that network in picking up the show. At the same time, the serial&#x27;s central characters – Amos, Andy and Kingfish – relocated from Chicago to Harlem. The program was so popular by 1930 that NBC&#x27;s orders were to only interrupt the broadcast for matters of national importance and SOS calls. Correll and Gosden were earning a combined salary of $100,000, which they split three ways to include announcer Bill Hay, who had been with them when they began in radio.

The story arc of Andy&#x27;s romance (and subsequent problems) with Harlem beautician Madame Queen entranced some 40 million listeners during 1930 and 1931, becoming a national phenomenon. Many of the program&#x27;s plotlines in this period leaned far more to straight drama than comedy, including the near-death of Amos&#x27;s fiancée Ruby from pneumonia in the spring of 1931 and Amos&#x27;s brutal interrogation by police following the murder of cheap hoodlum Jack Dixon that December. Following official protests by the National Association of Chiefs of Police, Correll and Gosden were forced to abandon that storyline, turning the entire sequence into a bad dream, from which Amos gratefully awoke on Christmas Eve.

The innovations introduced by Gosden and Correll made their creation a turning point for radio drama, as noted by broadcast historian Elizabeth McLeod:

&lt;poem&gt;As a result of its extraordinary popularity, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; profoundly influenced the development of dramatic radio. Working alone in a small studio, Correll and Gosden created an intimate, understated acting style that differed sharply from the broad manner of stage actors – a technique requiring careful voice modulation, especially in the portrayal of multiple characters. The performers pioneered the technique for varying both the distance from, and the angle of their approach to, the microphone to create the illusion of a group of characters. Listeners could easily imagine that they were in the taxicab office, listening to the conversation of close friends. The result was a uniquely absorbing experience for listeners, who, in radio&#x27;s short history, had never heard anything quite like &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;.

While minstrel-styled wordplay humor was common in the formative years of the program, it was used less often as the series developed, giving way to a more sophisticated approach to characterization. Correll and Gosden were fascinated by human nature, and their approach to both comedy and drama was drawn from their observations of the traits and motivations that drive the actions of all people. While their characters often overlapped popular African-American stereotypes, there was also a universality to their characters which transcended race; beneath the dialect and racial imagery, the series celebrated the virtues of friendship, persistence, hard work, and common sense, and as the years passed and the characterizations were refined, &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; achieved an emotional depth rivaled by few other radio programs of the 1930s.

Above all, Gosden and Correll were gifted dramatists. Their plots flowed gradually from one to the other, with minor subplots building in importance until they overtook the narrative, before receding to give way to the next major sequence; in this manner, seeds for storylines were often planted months in advance. This complex method of story construction kept the program fresh and enabled Correll and Gosden to keep their audiences in constant suspense. The technique that they developed for radio from that of the narrative comic strip endures as the standard method of storytelling in serial drama.&lt;/poem&gt;

Only a few dozen episodes of the original series have survived in recorded form. However, numerous scripts from the original episodes have been discovered and were used by McLeod when preparing her previously cited 2005 book.


&quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; was officially transferred by NBC from the Blue Network to the Red Network in 1935, although the vast majority of stations carrying the show remained the same. Several months later, Gosden and Correll moved production of the show from NBC&#x27;s Merchandise Mart studios in Chicago to Hollywood. After a long and successful run with Pepsodent, the program changed sponsors in 1938 to Campbell&#x27;s Soup; because of Campbell&#x27;s closer relationship with CBS, the series switched to that network on April 3, 1939.

In 1943, after 4,091 episodes, the radio program transformed from a 15-minute CBS weekday dramatic serial to an NBC half-hour weekly comedy. While the five-a-week show often had a quiet, easygoing feeling, the new version was a full-fledged sitcom in the Hollywood sense, with a regular studio audience (for the first time in the show&#x27;s history) and an orchestra. More outside actors, including many black comedy professionals, such as Eddie Green and James Baskett, were recruited for the cast. Many of the half-hour programs were written by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, later the writing team behind &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; and &quot;The Munsters&quot;. In the new version, the Amos character became peripheral to the duo of Andy and Kingfish, although Amos was still featured in the traditional Christmas show, which also became a part of the later television series. The later radio program and the TV version were advanced for the time, depicting blacks in a variety of roles, including those of successful business owners and managers, professionals and public officials, in addition to the comic characters at the show&#x27;s core. It anticipated and informed many later comedies featuring working-class characters (both black and white), including &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Sanford and Son.&quot;

By the fall of 1948, the show was airing on CBS again. In that same year, Correll and Gosden sold all rights to &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; to CBS for a reported $2.5 million.

===Theme song===

The theme song for both the radio and TV versions is &quot;The Perfect Song&quot; by Joseph Carl Breil, who had written the score from which the song is taken for the silent film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915).

===Sponsors===
Advertising pioneer Albert Lasker often took credit for having created the show as a promotional vehicle. After the associations with Pepsodent toothpaste (1929–37) and Campbell&#x27;s Soup (1937–43), primary sponsors included Lever Brothers&#x27;s Rinso detergent (1943–50); the Rexall drugstore chain (1950–54); and CBS&#x27;s own Columbia brand of television sets (1954–55). President Calvin Coolidge was said to be among the show&#x27;s most devoted listeners. Huey P. Long took his nickname, &quot;Kingfish&quot;, from the show. At the peak of its popularity, many movie theaters stopped their featured films for the 15 minutes of the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; show, playing the program through the theater&#x27;s sound system or from a radio on the stage before resuming their film. When some theaters began advertising this practice, NBC charged the theaters with copyright infringement, claiming that charging admission for a free broadcast was illegal.

===Opposition and the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; protest===

The first sustained protest against the program found its inspiration in the December 1930 issue of &quot;Abbott&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, when Bishop W. J. Walls of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church wrote an article sharply denouncing &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; for its lower-class characterizations and &quot;crude, repetitious, and moronic&quot; dialogue. The &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; was the second largest African-American newspaper at the time, and publisher Robert L. Vann expanded Walls&#x27; criticism into a full-fledged protest during a six-month period in 1931. As part of Vann&#x27;s campaign, more than 700,000 African-Americans petitioned the Federal Radio Commission to complain about the racist stereotyping on the show.

Historian James N. Gregory writes that the program &quot;became the subject of heated conflict within African American communities&quot; and that, while the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot; campaigned against the program, &quot;the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; lauded the show&#x27;s wholesome themes and good-natured humor,&quot; going &quot;so far as to feature Gosden and Correll at its annual community parade and picnic in 1931.&quot;

==Films==
In 1930, RKO Radio Pictures brought Gosden and Correll to Hollywood to appear in an Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy feature film, &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; (a catchphrase from the radio show). The cast included a mix of white and black performers (the latter including Duke Ellington and his orchestra) with Gosden and Correll playing Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy in blackface. The film pleased neither critics nor Gosden and Correll, but briefly became RKO&#x27;s biggest box-office hit before &quot;King Kong&quot; (1933).

Audiences were curious to see what their radio favorites looked like and were expecting to see African Americans instead of white men in blackface. RKO ruled out any plans for a sequel. Gosden and Correll did lend their voices to a pair of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; cartoon shorts produced by the Van Beuren Studios in 1934, &quot;The Rasslin&#x27; Match&quot; and &quot;The Lion Tamer&quot;. These were also not successful. Years later, Gosden was quoted as calling &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; &quot;just about the worst movie ever.&quot; Gosden and Correll also posed for publicity pictures in blackface. They were also stars of &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1936&quot; as Amos and Andy.

==Television==
Hoping to bring the show to television as early as 1946, Gosden and Correll searched for cast members for four years before filming began. CBS hired the duo as producers of the new television show. According to a 1950 newspaper story, Gosden and Correll had initial aspirations to voice the characters Amos, Andy and Kingfish for television while the actors hired for these roles performed and apparently were to lip-sync the story lines. A year later, both spoke about how they realized they were visually unsuited to play the television roles, citing difficulties with making the &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; film. No further mention was made about Gosden and Correll continuing to voice the key male roles in the television series. Correll and Gosden did record the lines of the main male characters to serve as a guideline for the television show dialogue at one point. In 1951, the men targeted 1953 for their retirement from broadcasting; there was speculation that their radio roles might be turned over to black actors at that time.

Adapted to television, &quot;The Amos &#x27;n Andy Show&quot; was produced from June 1951 to April 1953, and was primarily sponsored by the Blatz Brewing Company. 78 half hour episodes were eventually produced. The television series used black actors in the main roles, although the actors were instructed to keep their voices and speech patterns close to those of Gosden and Correll, and was produced at the Hal Roach Studios for CBS. The series&#x27; theme song was based on the radio show&#x27;s &quot;The Perfect Song&quot; but became Gaetano Braga&#x27;s &quot;Angel&#x27;s Serenade&quot;, performed by The Jeff Alexander Chorus. The program debuted on June 28, 1951.

The main roles in the television series were played by the following black actors:

* Amos Jones – Alvin Childress
* Andrew Hogg Brown (Andy) – Spencer Williams
* George &quot;Kingfish&quot; Stevens – Tim Moore
* Sapphire Stevens – Ernestine Wade
* Ramona Smith (Sapphire&#x27;s Mama) – Amanda Randolph
* Algonquin J. Calhoun – Johnny Lee
* Lightnin&#x27; – Nick Stewart (billed as &quot;Nick O&#x27;Demus&quot;)
* Ruby Jones – Jane Adams

;Uncredited cast in various episodes
* Ruby Dandridge in various roles
* Dudley Dickerson in various roles
* Roy Glenn as numerous authority figures
* Jester Hairston in various roles, a number of times as Henry Van Porter
* Theresa Harris as Gloretta 
* Jeni Le Gon in various roles
* Sam McDaniel in various roles
* Lillian Randolph as Madame Queen(2 episodes); Caroline&#x27;s mother (1 episode)
* Bill Walker in various roles

Vaudeville veteran Tim Moore as Kingfish became the undisputed star of the television version, and one of the first Black actors to achieve TV stardom. Amos, the hard-working family man, was mostly relegated to providing brief commentaries to the audience and occasionally intervening to rescue his friends from some mess of their own making. Many of the plots involved Kingfish trying to rope the naive Andy into a money-making scheme; this sometimes led to a twist ending that gave Andy the better of things. Another frequent scenario was Kingfish trying to hide some scheme or misdeed from the watchful eye of his wife Sapphire. Bachelor Andy&#x27;s roving eye for the ladies was also a source of plotlines. 
The NAACP mounted a formal protest almost as soon as the television version began, describing the show as &quot;a gross libel of the Negro and distortion of the truth&quot;.
In 1951 it released a bulletin on &quot;Why the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; TV Show Should Be Taken Off the Air.&quot; It stated that the show &quot;tends to strengthen the conclusion among uninformed and prejudiced people that Negroes are inferior, lazy, dumb, and dishonest, ... Every character&quot; is &quot;either a clown or a crook&quot;; &quot;Negro doctors are shown as quacks and thieves&quot;; &quot;Negro lawyers are shown as slippery cowards&quot;; &quot;Negro women are shown as cackling, screaming shrews&quot;; &quot;All Negroes are shown as dodging work of any kind&quot;; and &quot;Millions of white Americans see this &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; picture of Negroes and think the entire race is the same.&quot;

That pressure was considered a primary factor in the show&#x27;s cancellation, even though it finished at #13 in the 1951–1952 Nielsen ratings and at #25 in 1952–1953 Blatz was targeted as well, finally discontinuing its advertising support in June 1953. It has been suggested that CBS erred in premiering the show at the same time as the 1951 NAACP national convention, perhaps increasing the objections to it. The show was widely repeated in syndicated reruns until 1966 when, in an unprecedented action for network television at that time, CBS finally gave in to pressure from the NAACP and the growing civil rights movement and withdrew the program. It was pulled from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s television network, which had been broadcasting it for almost a decade. The series would not be seen on American television regularly for 46 more years. The television show has been available in bootleg VHS and DVD sets, which generally include up to 71 of the 78 known TV episodes.

When the show was canceled, 65 episodes had been produced. The last 13 of these episodes were intended to be shown on CBS during the 1953–54 season but were released with the syndicated reruns instead. An additional 13 episodes were produced for 1954–55 to be added to the syndicated rerun package. These episodes were focused on Kingfish, with little participation from Amos or Andy, because these episodes were to be titled &quot;The Adventures of Kingfish&quot; (though they ultimately premiered under the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; title.) The additional episodes first aired on January 4, 1955. Plans were made for a vaudeville act based on the television program in August 1953, with Tim Moore, Alvin Childress and Spencer Williams playing the same roles. It is not known whether there were any performances. Still eager for television success, Gosden, Correll and CBS made initial efforts to give the series another try. The plan was to begin televising &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; in the fall of 1956, with both of its creators appearing on television in a split screen with the proposed black cast.

A group of cast members began a &quot;TV Stars of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;&quot; cross-country tour in 1956, which was halted by CBS; the network considered it an infringement of their exclusive rights to the show and its characters. Following the threatened legal action that brought the 1956 tour to an end, Moore, Childress, Williams and Lee were able to perform in character for at least one night in 1957 in Windsor, Ontario.

==Later commentary on television series==
In the summer of 1968, the premiere episode of the CBS News documentary series &quot;Of Black America&quot;, narrated by Bill Cosby, showed brief film clips of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; in a segment on racial stereotypes in vintage motion pictures and television programing.

In 1983, a one-hour documentary film titled &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy: Anatomy of a Controversy&quot; aired in television syndication (and in later years, on PBS and on the Internet). It told a brief history of the franchise from its radio days to the CBS series, and featured interviews with surviving cast members as well as popular black television stars such as Redd Foxx and Marla Gibbs, who reflected on the show&#x27;s impact on their careers. Foxx and Gibbs emphasized the importance of the show featuring black actors in lead roles and expressed disagreement with the NAACP&#x27;s objections that had contributed to the program&#x27;s downfall. The film also contained highlights of a select episode of the classic TV series (&quot;Kingfish Buys a Lot&quot;) that had not been seen since it was pulled from the air in 1966.

In Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.&#x27;s 2012 &quot;American Heritage&quot; article &quot;Growing Up Colored&quot;, he wrote: &quot;And everybody loved &quot;Amos &#x27;n Andy&quot; – I don&#x27;t care what people say today...Nobody was likely to confuse them with the colored people we knew...&quot;

==Twenty-first century airing of series==
In 2004, the now-defunct Trio network returned &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; to television for one night in an effort to reintroduce the series to 21st century audiences. Its festival featured the &quot;Anatomy of a Controversy&quot; documentary followed by the 1930 &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; film.

In 2012, Rejoice TV, an independent television and Internet network in Houston, started airing the show weeknights on a regular, nationwide basis for the first time since CBS pulled the series from distribution in 1966. Six years later, Rejoice TV folded, and the series was again pulled from widespread distribution. There are no current official plans to rerelease the series to nationwide television.

==Ratings==
===Radio===
==Legal status==
Although the characters of Amos and Andy themselves are in the public domain, as well as the show&#x27;s trademarks, title, format, basic premise and all materials created prior to 1948 (&quot;Silverman vs CBS&quot;, 870 F.2d 40), the television series itself is protected by copyright. CBS bought out Gosden &amp; Correll&#x27;s ownership of the program and characters in 1948 and the courts decided in the &quot;Silverman&quot; ruling that all post-1948 &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; material was protected. All &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; material created prior to 1948, such as episodes of the old radio show, are in the public domain. The television series has never been officially released in home-video format, but many unlicensed bootleg compilations have been sold. In 1998, CBS initiated copyright infringement suits against three companies selling the videos and issued a cease-and-desist order to a national mail-order outfit that had offered episodes on videocassettes and advertised them in late-night television ads during the late 1990s. However, the unlicensed sets continue to be sold. No official, licensed DVD or Blu-ray compilations have been released.

==Later years==
In 1955, the format of the radio show was changed from a weekly to a daily early evening half-hour to include playing recorded music between sketches (with occasional guests appearing), and the series was renamed &quot;The Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy Music Hall&quot;. The final &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio show was broadcast on November 25, 1960. Although by the 1950s the popularity of the show was well below its peak of the 1930s, Gosden and Correll had managed to outlast most of the radio shows that came in their wake.

===Cartoon===
In 1961, Gosden and Correll attempted one last televised effort, albeit in a &quot;disguised&quot; version. They were the voices in a prime-time animated cartoon, &quot;Calvin and the Colonel&quot;, featuring anthropomorphic animals whose voices and situations were almost exactly those of Andy and the Kingfish (and adapting several of the original &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; radio scripts). This effort at reviving the series in a way that was intended to be less racially offensive ended after one season on ABC, although it remained quite popular in syndicated reruns in Australia for several years. Connelly and Mosher returned to produce the series and also wrote several episodes.

==Legacy==
In 1988, the &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; program was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. A pair of parallel, one-block streets in west Dallas, Texas are named Amos Street and Andy Street in honor of the characters.

The short-lived 1996 HBO sitcom &quot;The High Life&quot; was intended in part as an homage to &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, but with white characters.

Blues guitarist Christone &quot;Kingfish&quot; Ingram was given the nickname &quot;Kingfish&quot; after the sitcom by one of his guitar teachers, Bill &quot;Howl-N-Madd&quot; Perry.

The show was referenced by &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in &quot;Duffless&quot;, the sixteenth episode of the fourth season, which premiered on February 18, 1993. While Homer is on a tour at the Duff brewery, an old ad for the brand is played, showing that Duff was a &quot;proud sponsor&quot; of &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; back in the 50s.

In the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta) visit a &#x27;50s-themed diner that offers on its menu an &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot; milkshake.

==Later work by television cast members==
Comedian Tim Moore made numerous public appearances and was a guest on television on shows such as &quot;Jack Paar&#x27;s Tonight Show&quot; and the Paul Coates Show. In 1958, he headlined a standup comedy act at the Mocambo Night Club in Hollywood.

Ernestine Wade (Sapphire) and Lillian Randolph (Madame Queen) appeared together on an episode of &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot; called &quot;Clifton&#x27;s Sugar Mama&quot; on October 2, 1974. They were friends of &quot;Mama,&quot; played by Theresa Merritt, who wanted to see Clifton, played by Clifton Davis (later of the TV show &quot;Amen&quot;), at the beginning of the episode. Wade played Augusta and Randolph played Mrs. Birdie.

Jester Hairston (who played Henry Van Porter and Leroy Smith) was a regular on both &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot; as &quot;Wildcat&quot; and on &quot;Amen&quot; as &quot;Rolly Forbes.&quot; He was also quite prominent in a brief role as a butler in the racially charged film &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967).

Amanda Randolph (Sapphire&#x27;s mother, Ramona Smith) had a recurring role as Louise the housekeeper on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot; and appeared in the show&#x27;s 1967 reunion program, which aired shortly after her death.

Nick Stewart (Lightnin&#x27;) had a memorable cameo in &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; (1963) as a hapless driver run off the highway. Stewart and Johnny Lee (Calhoun) both provided voices in the Walt Disney film &quot;Song of the South&quot; in 1946. Johnny did the voice of Br&#x27;er Rabbit and Nick was heard as Br&#x27;er Bear. The film also starred black actor James Baskett, who had voiced the Gabby Gibson character in the radio series.
